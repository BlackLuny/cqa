BVaCJkxzaa	Everyone is a slave to the government. The government tells you how to live, forces education on you, holds your property hostage for taxes, forces medical care on you, tells you where you can go and how you can get there and what fees are payable to them for your travel. There is almost no aspect of your life that government has no control over or claim to. We are all slaves to the government that should be working for us.|`|ExCAedp4aa	Paying taxes does not make one a slave and your assumption that the money paid to the government by the firm would go to the worker is a false assumption.<br>  <br>  Edit: No avoidance (as usual?), just the facts, and since they don't force you to stay at your job under threat of death, it's technically not slavery at all and the rest of your question is moot. But if you ever take microeconomics 101 you'd know that the money to pay the tax will come from the customers of the firm, not from the employees.|`|aVEVchFxaa	Well in that case, people who work for the government are some well paid slaves.

As Americans accumulate debt they lose their freedom to quit a job they can't stand or negotiate from a position of economic independence to be treated fairly by an employer.  The combination of the employers and the banks are making us come closer to indentured servitude. That's a short hop from slavery.  In simpler terms how many people have you met who hate their job yet cannot afford to quit and fear to voice their gripes legitimate or otherwise?

AA11570675	I think your question highlights a problem with thinking in the UK. It is always assumed the economy can continue growing & so can infrastructure, & nobody dares yet to admit to a saturation point, or as economists might put it a point of inverse returns on investment.<br>  We reached this in agriculture in the 1960s when it was realised that putting ever more chemicals on the land ceased to enhance production & was actually poisoning it. In planning terms it is assumed that as people have choice, they can choose to be ever more crowded together & provide greater economic returns without harm. No account has been taken of society problems linked to overcrowding e.g. health, crime etc. or physical & environmental problems such as flooding, pollution etc. So to please the economists in the media who influence the way we vote the government talks about building ever more houses in the south of England without regard to the damage this does or the empty homes in other parts of the country where there has been no investment in jobs or infrastructure for decades. Of course you always get a quicker return on your investment if you don't have to (re)build the infrastructure first.<br>  So we end up with competition for what is still viable & economic with destruction of what could be good but would take more investment to regenerate. Urban primacy evolves, where cities like London dominate the rest of the country. Here I have to use an analogy, a primate city becomes a bit like a black hole at the centre of a galaxy, everything operates around it, but it sucks all other wealth into it (doesn't the credit crunch illustrate this?). So if the analogy is correct, London could become an economic black hole, serviced by spiral arms of a galaxy of towns whose location is determined by access links i.e motorways, trains, & in future airports.<br>  The planners of proposed new towns looked at all these things but disregarded the environment they would destroy. So for example the proposed town of Cranbrook near Exeter was right next to its airport & the M5 & would have had a railway link too. Planning reached an advanced stage until developers realised it was on a flood plain & nobody in their right mind would build a new town there! So it became another example of the thinking that fails to realise the environmental unsustainability of ever more development on existing infrastructure.<br>  Perhaps at some time the politicians & planners will realise that industry needs to be encouraged to invest outside present economic hotspots. Preferably, planning should cease to be centred around London as the centre of a UK economic galaxy. Without such an incentive, we're beginning to see industry investing in "greenfield" economies where the lower cost of development outweighs the absence of infrastructure e.g. bank & computer call centres in India, or mega factories in former Eastern Europe & East Asia. We have already seen formerly undeveloped economies leapfrogging existing technology in traditional rich economies such as UK & USA. For example, absence of phone lines meant that mobiles are more used elsewhere & with that came mobile based computer networks that we still don't have much of here. The probability is that these economies will also leapfrog ours, so that eventually our jobseekers will be moving to other countries.<br>  So my answer to your question is that 100,000 new homes probably won't ever be built in Britain. Instead as this country becomes more of an economic backwater, the population that would have lived in them will relocate to other richer economies which spiral around continental rather than national economic hubs.|`|ebee988c7e88e57112c395fec80ac354aa	Britain is already overcrowded and there is a shortage of affordable houses.  Therefore it is reasonable to build new housing stock in suitable locations; there are lots of brown field sites suitable.  Current building regulations ensure that new builds have greater thermal efficiency and over time will of set the carbon footprint of construction. <br>  <br>  Also with the construction industry suffering the brunt of the current economic downturn; new building projects will generate employment and wealth.  Urban renewal projects can revitalise towns and cities creating modern living spaces and repopulating city centre's.  <br>  <br>  Also I am not sure why this question is listed in immigration, is it not mre related to town planning ?|`|P0gIKAVJaa	Britain seems overcrowded because planning laws have resulted in the population being densely packed into urban areas - but the fact remains close to 90% of the land area in England (the most populated part of Britain) is actually non-urban.|`|Aah86hEmaa	Well the media predict 75000 repossessions, so that solves 75% of the problem.<br>  <br>  So perhaps the priority will be large cardboard boxes for the poor people who have had their houses taken, by the Banks to reside on their balance sheet?<br>  <br>  Aided and abetted by Greedon Brown with our money.|`|HYFQpkylaa	build them all on the coast i say.<br>  forget about the environment and future generations,what about quality accommodation for us now.<br>  i know my kids would rather me leave them a house by the sea than a crapy terraced in a dead end street.|`|oLz4jYXqaa	What for?

This government is strong on pronouncements and weak on thought. All the best building land was taken up about 100 years ago so the only true places are brown field land and this will cause terrible problems with contamination. Build them to far out and you are making it difficult for people to get to and from work. They have also forgotten that transportation which was once a minor incidental expenditure is now a major budget item in every family budget. This is part of the reason why many find it economically more sensible to work the system rather than get a job. i think a lot more thought is needed but they will not have to do it because a little bit of delay and an election the problem will not be the at the door of this Labour Government.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	I expect the Government will put them on greenfield sites, in their eco-towns (a load of hype if ever I heard any) and of course miles and hours away from any jobs and without a decent public transport system.<br>  <br>  This country has been overpopulated for years.  The argument that we need ever-increasing immigration does not make sense, especially as we have never been without high unemployment since the days of Thatcher.

If you come out, we kick you out.<br>  It is bad enough with female integration into the army, let alone install another unstable sexual element into the mix.<br>  call me a sexist, i dont care.<br>  let me give you and example: a female is in a combat role, she is assigned to defend a certain sector. she is good at what she does, and defends her area well, but is about to be over run. the men see this, and BY NATURE will shift their fire to try to defend her, weakening their own position, and screwing up the whole operation.<br>  Just one example, i could site pages more (besides human nature)<br>  About gays in the military, the whole 'equality' thing is a bunch of crap, it is about morale.<br>  If you are in the Army, you can be as gay as you want to be, there has been gays in the army since it has been the army.<br>  just dont flaunt it.<br>  Another example: You are in a foxhole with a guy who is openly gay. He is bigger than you, stronger than you, and he LIKES you. <br>  It is obvious what kind of distraction this would be if you are more worried about the guy next to you than the enemy.<br>  Homophobic? maybe, but the Army doesnt want to take any chances.<br>  Why should the gay/lesbian community get special treatment over male/female relationships? If you are caught boning some hottie that is a private, and you are a sergeant, that is called fraternization,and you are BUSTED<br>  The reason why many military troops were ticked off at Clinton (besides sending us in to shooting galleries without support), was that he GOT AWAY with illegitimate sex that we would have gotten busted for. He was the commander in chief of the U.S. military, and was supposed to be an example for us to follow.<br>  what a low life.<br>  Again, there is nothing stopping you from being gay in the military.<br>  just dont get caught|`|19L99wvCaa	I agree with Colette.

People in need of something to believe in will likely fall for any line of bull you feed them and never question it.  The Dems. real goal is to keep the poor poor the rich rich and the middle paying for it all.  If they keep the poor where they are then the Dems always have a target audience.  How would Lenin have overthrown Tsar Nicholas if there were no poor folks to whip into a frenzy?  The claim that the GOP is the party of the rich is just plain wrong.  It's the party that believes a person should make their own way in life.  The Dems believe in giving people hand outs to keep them dependant on the Gov.  paid for with the taxes of the middle class.  The rich Dems are elitists and don't want the poor to get to their level.  They look down on them and give them handouts to keep them in the ghetto and trailer park so that the rich Dems can feel good about "helping" the poor but they never have to see them.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Yes.

The passing of sentences must also be pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Article 3's protections exist even though no one is classified as a prisoner of war.<br>  <br>  Having "terrorist suspects" or anyone else held at Gitmo is the worst thing the US has done since the Japanese Internment camps of WW II.  How can the US claim to be a "becon of democracy" when they forcibly withhold basic human rights from other human beings?<br>  <br>  And even if they are guilty of fighting against the US or planning attacks against the US, they should face a court of law for their actions.  Otherwise, they should be released or turned over to their government.<br>  <br>  If the US is serious about fighting a so-called "Global War on Terror", the best weapon they can use is to set the proper example, not succumb to the level of the perceived terrorists.<br>  <br>  And yes, I'm a 12 year Army combat vet who got out because I, like thousands of other US service members, wasn't going to fight in the BS war in Iraq.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Because most of them have not even been accused of anything let alone convicted.

Over the years I have voted for candidates from both parties. McCain was more in line with my views and I mainly liked the fact that he was a military man and I think the commander in chief should have some military service to fully understand the military. His age did not matter to me at all. I do know many conservatives stayed home, voted Libertarian, or did not vote for president in the last election mainly because of his moderate stands rather than his age.|`|01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	I think McCain lost because of three reasons....none of which had to do with his age...<br>  <br>       1)  He was a totally different candidate then he was in 2000.  The McCain of 2000 would not recognize, nor vote for the McCain of 2008.<br>  <br>       2)  His voting record showed him in support of Pres. Bush a good 95 % of the time.  Who wanted that after the last 8 years?<br>  <br>       3) His choice of Palin was a disaster.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	No.  In the end, people vote for one team or the other.  If Obama was 72 he still would've gotten about the same amount of votes (the media also wouldn't have run a bunch of stories about Alzheimer's last fall).|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	I think for some it was, and then put that together with Palin as the VP running mate, I think most were concerned she didn't have enough experience in case something happened to McCain while in office.

nfXbqCgZaa	Once you plead guilty, the odds of having a guilty plea dismissed is about a million to one.  In other words, it is very hard to get a guilty plea dismissed.  Usually you would have to demonstrate some sort of travesty of justice would occur if you were not allowed to withdraw your guilty plea.  <br>  <br>  Usually, when you plead guilty, the judge asks you all sorts of questions about whether or not you understand the charges, understand that you are "giving up the Right to appeal" and that you are voluntarily pleading guilty.  If you answer yes to these questions, then you don't really have a lot going for you in regards to withdrawing your plea.<br>  <br>  In my experience, I have only seen a couple pleas withdrawn, and they were because the prosecution changed the deal they had proposed.  However, it is possible ... just very very tough to withdraw a guilty plea.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you aren't guilty of a crime, then you shouldn't plead guilty to it.  I know that's easier said than done, but that's the only way you can appeal your case.<br>  <br>  However, to be successful you WILL need an attorney for this one.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	What you have described is called influencing a witness by intimidation.

Unfortunately, this is going to be more difficult for you to do because of your PTSD.  You will have to find a lawyer.  I understand about the PTSD.  My uncle has it and there are a lot of things that freak him out that would not bother other people.  You could try contacting the police department anonymously and see about adding you to their investigation.  Let them know that he harassed you also and threatened you and your family.  You might no be able to stay anonymous the whole time, but if he has done this to others the charges are more likely to stick and he won't be able to know who said what about him.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Talk to the prosecutor and a defense attorney.  You should immediately get a restraining order against him.  I suspect, like signing a contract under extortion, admitting guilt under extortion can be excused.  The problem is you need to prove the extortion.  Do you have any witnesses or evidence of his threats?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I have trouble understanding people tolerating such things.  If anybody made that threat to me, I would immediately tell them they should turn themselves in right now.  I would tell them the next time I see them near me or any member of my family, that would be the last spot they live on this earth, even if it means it's also my last spot.<br>  <br>  Such people don't belong on this earth with the rest of us.  I could devote my entire existence to remove them.  I'm assuming, of course, that wasn't just an idle threat or only a bluff to scare you.<br>  <br>  In fact,  are you willing to pay my way to there?  Let me know where you are and where he is.  Then tell that person if he harms you or your family and the police don't find him, I will.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	yes  a  plea  under those  conditions  may  be  subject to reversal. but  your  lawyer  will  have  to  prove  the  point. you  did  accept  the  plea however  so your  credibility  might  suffer.|`|jrdtQi04aa	If this person is the kind of person that I think they are, you may be stuck with a crime that you didnt commit.  People like this usually have "someone" who will make good on thier promises to "get" someone.  You have to be careful.  Is there any way that you can be guaranteed protection?  Can your family be guaranteed protection?  This is what makes me angry.  The police and prosecuters already have your case closed, I dont think they will be wonderfully open to reopening the case.  You will have to speak to them, and you may have to testify against this person.  Is it worth it?  You really have to make that decision.  So many of these thugs get away with so much, and this is the reason why.  No one wants to risk their life or the lives of their families, and I dont blame anyone for that.  These people will and do hurt people all the time.  Pray about it, and keep praying for a solution.  Good luck to you, but I seriously think you may be stuck.

AA11696297	a curious issue.  i grew up in Arizona with no daylight savings time.  didn't need it.  here in the northwest things are a lot different, days are very short in winter.  add to that the constant cloud cover (obviously western Washington), and it gets quite dark by 3.30 or 4 PM.<br>  <br>  originally it was promoted so that children didn't have to walk home from school in the dark.  then some types of businesses profit from the earlier hours.  but we only get eight or nine hours of daylight anyway, and that's often not very light.<br>  <br>  actually, i don't like daylight savings, it leaves me confused for two or three days, twice a year.

For one, the founding fathers needed to have standing armies in case there was another invasion. General Lafayette wasn't going to bail us out again. Furthermore, the Americans didn't want to let the country fall under the control of another monarchy, so it made the very easy provision of allowing state militias in case a particular state or the federal government became totalitarian.|`|e68ed70654e71ea7f425cc92736a0d51aa	because of crap like this<br>  <br>  H.R. 45 (Rush):  This bill would require a license for handguns and semiautomatics, including those currently possessed.  The applicant must be thumbprinted and sign a certification that, effectively, the firearm will not be kept in a place where it would be available for the defense of the gun owner’s family.  The applicant must also make available ALL of his psychiatric records, pass an exam, and pay a fee of up to $25.  The license may be renewed after five years and may be revoked.  Private sales would be outlawed, and reports to the attorney general of all transactions would be required, even when, as the bill allows, the AG determines that a state licensing system is sufficiently draconian to substitute for the federal license.  With virtually no exceptions, ALL firearms transactions (involving semiautos, handguns, long guns, etc.) would be subject to a Brady check.  In addition, the bill would make it unlawful in nearly all cases to keep any loaded firearm for self-defense.  A variety of “crimes by omission” (such as failure to report certain things) would be created.  Criminal penalties of up to ten years and almost unlimited regulatory and inspection authority would be established.<br>  <br>  <br>  Look it up (probably won't go any place, but the audacity to submit it)<br>  <br>  When the government finally bans the ownership of guns for private use, what will you then use to defend yourself from the government.  The government will then have absolute control, and will finally be a dictatorship"<br>  <br>  "When the government fears the people, you have democracy.  When the people fear their government, you have tyranny."  Thomas Jefferson|`|aBALRxBUaa	Because we are tired of seeing our rights being trampled on over the illusion of "public safety". Many people have been big supporters of gun control. Some of them have also been known in history as dictators. No dictatorship has supported the individual right to keep and bear arms. And that is what the 2nd Amendment is about. The individual right to keep and bear arms. That is why it is mentioned as the "right of the people" and is included in the 1st 10 Amendments, also know as the Bill of Rights.|`|THxtB2Ptaa	why do libs get loud and boisterous about gays and tree hugging and taking away guns? they get loud and boisterous about how horrible bush was (i admit, he was pretty freakin' bad) but praise obama for doing exactly what bush did but on a grander scale. we're set up for 4 years of failure and the REAL "4 more years of bush".<br>  <br>  the second amendment exists so we can protect ourselves and help keep the government in check when they start acting like @sses. without us being able to do that, say goodbye to your precious gay rights and tree hugging. cheers.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	because they love this country and want to preserve it,gay rights is not a discrimination factor,it is a special rights grab.of those 11,000 americans killed by guns,how many are gang related,how many are criminals  that are killed. can you list the number of lives saved by guns?people defending themselves? you don't understand that it is the 2nd amendment that helps keep all the others intact|`|FSsl25SLaa	Why do Democrats get loud and boisterous when the topic of racism comes up in conversation?

I don't like being forced to pay for other people's mistakes.<br>  <br>  See how leftists make things up to force their idea of what is right on other people? Again, I want my freedom from tyrants such as yourself.|`|AA12212403	If I asked a question like this, I would be reported and it would be taken down.<br>  I won't report you as I like the idea that you are displaying your ignorance.<br>  I am never loud and boisterous, I believe in environmental causes and have no major feelings one way or another about gays - live and let live.  I think there are so many more priorities than to worry about that.<br>  I'm republican and do not fit into anything you have stated at all.<br>  You are judging by one or two people and do not get to know any of us.|`|DtIcDLTcaa	I'm a Republican and I hate guns.  I hate knowing my neighbors have guns.  I hate that guns accidently kill and harm people every year.  The only thing I fear more is that someone could come in and take our rights away.  They could use government money unwisely (calling it a stimulus package) and then force us to pay more in taxes (what's going to happen by next year - already happening in New Jersey).  Take away our rights to have our voice heard - they would just run the country without regard to what the people want.  Oh I forgot that's what's going on now.  I guess I still hate guns.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	So.  If you have a problem defending the Constitution, go live in a dictatorship for a year and criticize the dictator.  Nice knowing you.  The founders understood that people may have to one day defend themselves from their own government.  Maybe you could learn something by reading on your own instead of regurgitating everything they teach you in school.  I guess they still aren't teaching you how to think in school yet.|`|261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	It's interesting to note how liberals can believe anything in our Constitution is "a simple topic" I tend to have a lot more respect for the document. By the way, the Right to keep and bear arms is in the bill of rights, It tends to fluster liberals when I mention the Rights guaranteed by the bill of rights were doggedly,persistently and unanimously agreed upon by the Founding Fathers to be given to the citizens of every country by God. The Bill of Rights simply limits the Government from taking the God given rights away.|`|etcMARCAaa	I am not republican.  But, I get angry anytime any of my Constitutional freedoms are threatened.  It's very simply really. If someone honestly feels that citizens should not be permitted to bear arms then they should put it to a Constitutional amendment and let 3/4s of the states decide.  If they attempt any other method of outlawing firearms then they are breaking our law. If 3/4s of the states ratify an amendment to outlaw firearms then I will abide by it but until then all laws restricting weapons should be carefully scrutinized and challenged.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	I DON"T KNOW DAMMIT@@!<br>  <br>  Maybe because the founding fathers considered it critical to protecting all of the rest of the Bill of Rights.  But what do they know?  They only founded the country by defeating a tyrranical government.  Some fat guy from Michigan is the real expert since he made a movie.|`|ExCAedp4aa	They actually believe there's a conspiracy to take away gun ownership rights.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	I agree your causes to save people, but they're both pretty gay.

Do you even know the second amendment...?<br>  "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."<br>  That being said I will protect my state and freedoms and keep my guns..

The Nazis massacred many innocent Jews who could not afford to leave Germany or the German occupied areas.<br>  <br>  All the wealthy Jews (who I assume Hitler was really angry with, as they were the ones with the power) simply left Germany and relocated elsewhere. No extremely powerful Jews (including at that time most Zionists) died in the Holocaust. You think a banker with wealth and connections beyond belief let himself get put into any concentration camp? No. They just relocated themselves so they were out of Nazi reach. Only the poor and innocent Jews who couldn't afford to move are the ones to suffer. That is the same today.

This year is special, because it marks the 40th anniversary of my independence.<br>  <br>  On June 30, 1968, I escaped Communist Cuba and a few months later I was in the United States to stay. That I happened to arrive in Richmond on Thanksgiving Day is just part of the story, but I digress.<br>  <br>  I've thought a lot about the anniversary this year. The election-year rhetoric has made me think a lot about Cuba and what transpired there. In the late 1950s, most Cubans thought Cuba needed a change, and they were right. So when a young leader came along, every Cuban was at least receptive.<br>  <br>  When the young leader spoke eloquently and passionately and denounced the old system, the press fell in love with him. They never questioned who his friends were or what he really believed in. When he said he would help the farmers and the poor and bring free medical care and education to all, everyone followed. When he said he would bring justice and equality to all, everyone said "Praise the Lord." And when the young leader said, "I will be forchange and I'll bring you change," everyone yelled, "Viva Fidel!"|`|836d9fce0375ffcf90741051b73d8c82aa	Yes, I believe these are two important inalienable rights, that we still have, and should exercise and enjoy to the best of our ability ! ! !<br>  Like you say, it does a Patriotic Heart good, to know that all our forefathers have sacrificed for this country will not be in vain! |`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	When the Revolutionary War happened, my family had already been in America for well over a century.

First off, the Turks are learning that in a free society you have to allow for their to be an opposition which might say or write rude things about the government and that you cannot simply lock up a person for writing some story of which the government does not approve.<br>  <br>  Meanewhile the EU are watching the situation in Turkey very carefully.<br>  <br>  Welcome to Aphrodisias - an almost intact Greco-Romano city in Turkey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ1VbWNyKBI" rel="nofollow">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ1VbWNyKB...</a><br>  <br>  For those people who think that Turkey is non-European, should think again.

After all, Turkey is the gateway to Asia, so why not let that be a step towards better relations between Europe and Asia?<br>  <br>  In May 2008, Queen Elizabeth II said during a visit to Turkey, that "Turkey is uniquely positioned as a bridge between the East and West at a crucial time for the European Union and the world in general."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/turkey/8927125.asp?gid=231&sz=72094" rel="nofollow">http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/turke...</a><br>  <br>  The argument that Turkey isn't totally European (it's half European and half Asian) isn't a creditable one either.  Morocco is courting the EU to eventually become a member, and none of it's territory is in Europe.  But the concept that one must be in Europe to be part of the EU is not only short-sided, but ridiculous.  In the world today, political and economical conditions are widespread, and to think that one can contain that influence by continent is just ignorant.<br>  <br>  It's like telling other countries that they can't be a member of NATO because they're not in the North Atlantic.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  I read the article, but like in any survey, you can skew the information anyway you want.<br>  <br>  Besides, I don't think that 6,482 Turks are representative of the 71.5 MILLION people that live in the country.

More of a urban vs rural political break with Democrats representing more rural areas being more against it and some Republicans being large city representatives being more for it.  The math does break down that more Democrats are in favor of much more restrictive gun ownership laws and all of the Congressman being in favor of a total ban are but based more on who they represent then anything else. Won't go into field stripping the M1911A1 which was the military weapon when I joined, honestly do not care for the pistol, and the M1911 has not been used since the 1920's when the A1 model replaced it, since that means nothing as far as whether or not some one believes n the individual rights under the 2nd Amendment.  I also don't mastur=bate over my guns like an inbred Republican-you really shoot yourself in the foot saying that you believe in then coming out with a slam against others who do makes it sound like you really don't but just pay lip service or are saying you are when you aren't.  My wife is a liberal and usually votes Democrat, including the last five Presidential elections (did vote for Reagan both times), but goes shooting with me and has her own pistol.|`|F1bjZjkaaa	One thing is being able to use a gun, another is to realise the effects that guns have on society. Do not confuse them. They are different. One requires a certain hands on skill, knowledge of how the gun works, the parts. This does not help you understand that guns can often do more damage than they do harm in a society, especially if the guns are not regulated properly. <br>  <br>  All those who are good with guns will say "guns don't kill people, people do", which is right to a certain extent, except it ignores that fact that a person with a gun kills a lot more easily than a person without a gun. Evidence for this. 3/4 of all murders in the US happen with guns, the UK murder rate is 1/4 that of the US murder rate, meaning the UK murder rate is on par with the US non-gun murder rate. A coincidence or evidence that if the US were able to deal with its problem the murder rate would be much lower? <br>  <br>  I support the 2A, but i also think there needs to be enough control over guns and their owners to prevent guns getting on the illegal market. I also think education and opportunities are very important, especially for those america has forgotten, those in the inner city "ghettos", criminals who are educated are less likely to reoffend, children who are educated are less likely to commit crimes. <br>  <br>  I also know how to use guns, never used a 1911 colt pistol though.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	The election is over.

Lame duck Presidents and Congressman are both very careful about what they do and much is limited by the repercussions on the incoming administration.  I heard all sorts of talk about what he was going to do to mess up President Obama and I think he was very careful not to do things that would-he even left half of the 700 billion he was authorized to spend which still has not been used; being very much a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation for the out going administration.  What he did not do was pardon big money supporters and as a matter of fact issued the least number of pardons and the least last minute Executive Orders to make policies then any other modern President.   I think one of the tops in those categories were former President Clinton and the most EO's to start an administration is the current President.

Es como si te pusieras a pelear con piedras cuando tu contrincante tiene flechas. Por dichos motivos es difícil combatir el narcotráfico.<br>  <br>  Fox, a pesar de ser el primer panista con poder desde hace más de 75 a?os, no hizo las cosas tan mal. El dólar se estableció y se "congeló" por muchos a?os. Mientras que con Salinas de Gortari, de la Madrid, Zedillo, etc.. sólo subió por las nubes.<br>  Pero mucha gente "ilusa" adoraba a Salinas de Gortari porque el dolar estaba a 3 pesos... RECORDEMOS QUE SALINAS LE QUITO UN CERO A LA MONEDA NACIONAL..Así que no estaba a 3, sino a 30... y con el presidente anterior estaba a 18.. (osea se devaluó un 80%).<br>  <br>  TODOS los mexicanos somos culpables de lo que nos sucede. Simplemente nosotros mismos alimentamos la corrupción y la democracia. Si nos tomamos una copa en el bar y pretendemos conducir después de haber consumido alcohol.. si nos tocó la suerte de ser parados por un agente de tránsito.. TODOS hemos ofrecido "mordidas" para safar del problema.. y sin embargo somos los primeros en quejarnos de la corrupción de los policías... La mula no era parca.. la hicieron... me explico?<br>  <br>  El día en que todos respetemos las reglas de tránsito, de convivencia, laborales, sociales y democraticas, ese día no sólo se van a acabar nuestros problemas, sino que México pasaría de tercer mundo a primer mundo, y con ello nos beneficiaríamos todos....<br>  <br>  La culpa no es del PRI o del PAN.... (que si tuviera que elegir me quedo con el PAN mil veces que con el corruptísimo PRI) que con el afán de quitárle a los ricos y darle a los pobres (Fco I. Madero) lo único que consiguió fue crear sicarios, ajiotistas, revoltosos y resentidos ante la clase alta TRABAJADORA... que una vez en el poder se quedaron con el dinero que le robaron a los ricos y no repartieron nada... Eso es el PRI... Partido REVOLUCIONARIO Insitucional... Una bola de incultos que jamás fueron a la escuela y se quejaban de los ricos que estudiaron y que por el mismo motivo tenían una mejor vida.<br>  <br>  La cara siempre tiene dos monedas.. el pobre odia al rico porque tienen mejores autos, casas, ropa... El rico desprecia al pobre por inculto, maleducado, sin modales.. no hablan bien ni su propio idioma y ni siquiera pisaron la escuela... No tienen ningún derecho de regir a un país... porque si no pudieron ni con primaria o con la universidad (AMLO) menos que menos van a poder controlar un pais que está en el pozo porque sus habitantes en vez de tratar de salir de él.. cavan en sentido contrario... hundiéndose más. (a esto me refiero que la gente cava su propia tumba cuando ofrecen mordidas, se cuelgan del cablevision, o se roban electricidad, etc...) Es imposible que la casa huela lindo cuando sus habitantes defecan en la sala y no el el ba?o...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte.|`|d0acf8bbc492468f149757819d1fd5a4aa	no eres pejefan pero ya condenaste al PAN a ser el partido del narcotrafico, si no fueses tendencioso hubiese te hubieses referido al "sexenio de Fox" no al PAN, si te acuerdas, Fox fue un presidente que se tambien se distancio muchisimo del PAN precisamente porque quizo hacer las cosas a su modo cosa que le impidio seguir buenos consejos de su propia base politica. y si, una de las cosas que mas hemos adolecido es la falta de voluntad politica para endurecer las leyes anti drogas, aunque el verdadero sexenio del narco fue el de Salinas de Gortari que permitio el paso de Toneladas de drogas a traves de aviones Boing 747 repletos de cocaina y heroina por los aeropuertos del pais.|`|086d6d6819090050dbc54b8bd34805f8aa	Te lo creeria... si tuviera 5 a?os.<br>  <br>  P.D.<br>  <br>  Gracias por tu luz.

At that time I was for who my parents were for, like most kids. Looking back now, it makes me laugh because in debate class most kids were on the Liberal side because it was 'the cool thing to do' and were just all around young and dumb lol. <br>  After some significant events in my early 20's, I sat down and took a look at the values of both parties- -while neither one is perfect, I have to go with whoever's morals are closer to mine (pro-life, is the main thing). <br>  <br>  People say its not that big of an issue, but it's usually one of the first things to be messed with when a new president gets into office.<br>  And for me, it kind of for shadows how the President will treat the country- if he is ok with taking away innocent life and human rights to a baby, whats stopping him from treating us that way?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I voted Rep this year- I am not a die hard stick-to-your-party type.

McCain admits to having made a tape, but there is little evidence that it was ever used and in it he may not have been forthcoming enough for the tape to be useful as propaganda. Evidence of more recordings cannot be substantiated because no one has actually gone through the hundreds of hours of poor recordings of North Vietnamese propaganda broadcasts which have been archived to catalog what is actually in them. So those who claim that McCain was actively involved in propagandizing for his captors are mostly just guessing or making it up based on very little real evidence.<br>  <br>  Claims that McCain collaborated in other meaningful ways are also very questionable. McCain was noted for not participating in many of the staged events where his captors put cooperative prisoners on display, and perhaps most significantly, when repeatedly offered the opportunity to be sent home by his captors — which would have had substantial propaganda value — he refused to be released, unless other prisoners who had been held longer were released first. McCain's willingness to endure several extra years of torture when signing a few simple statements and cooperating would have gotten him sent home quickly, contrasts with many who others signed statements against the war, and were sent home, suffering no real consequences for their actions, while McCain insisted on staying almost to the end of the war."<br>  (this article was written by Dave Nalle and is from his website: <a href="http://www.fontcraft.com/rod/?p=390)." rel="nofollow">http://www.fontcraft.com/rod/?p=390).</a><br>  <br>  McCain/Palin '08|`|Mrr3AR4Laa	I only wished Obama had any meaningful life experiences, or any experiences at all except for hanging around corruption and marxists.|`|dGKNOzkxaa	Um, McCain was exonerated from the Keating 5 scandal.

ejE8qTAtaa	I agree with you.  Clothing which is "acceptable" nowadays is something that would have gotten you arrested years ago.  Morality keeps slipping further and further down the drain and people are accepting it without a care.  And not just clothing but look at sex on television, homosexuality, music lyrics, alcohol consumption, drugs, etc.  We are being bombarded with immorality from all sides.  I feel that we are never going to get better.|`|iCqfmRC3aa	Ok, I have definite opinions here ... What is wrong with the human body?  Breasts? ... guess what ... we all have them, men and women.  Genitals ... yep, we all got them too.  <br>  <br>  Our children are born naked, and they like being naked, until we teach them to be ashamed of, and hide their bodies.  We create situations that often later manifest into body image issues.  <br>  <br>  The human body is not sexual; all sexuality comes from the mind. Yet, girls and women are encouraged to buy and wear clothing that is intended to create sexual thoughts, and we call it fashion.<br>  <br>  I would be upset if my daughter were viewing murder and mayhem, sex scenes, or some of our “sex sells” advertisements, but not simple nudity.  <br>  <br>  Our society is finally getting to the point where nudity is a mainstream recreation.  $450 Million was spent on nude recreation travel last year, 55 Million Americans freely admit to having skinny-dipped with members of the opposite sex and 74% of Americans support nude recreation in appropriate settings, according to a 2006 Roper Poll.  <br>  <br>  There are 270 Family oriented clubs and resorts sanctioned by the American Association for Nude Recreation where entire families spend time enjoying nude recreation in a safe and secure environment.  <br>  <br>  It is a little hard to tell from your question, but it appears your wife was ok with your daughter watching the show, if so she is in the majority.<br>  <br>  What harm could it cause?  I think we can all agree that your daughter is not likely to run out in the street and take off her clothes because she saw the show. <br>  <br>  However, there are many, many instances where damage could be done, in movies, TV shows and even on the news when sex, murder and mayhem is thrown about willy-nilly.  <br>  <br>  And don't let me get started on the fashion ... sex sells mentality that is running rampant.  I have a lot of difficulty understanding how making sexual innuendos is "ok" but simple nudity would be considered bad.<br>  <br>  Research shows that children who grow up in a nudist setting tend to be more self-confident, more self-accepting, and more sexually well-adjusted. Children that grow up in a nudist environment know what other bodies look like so they do not have to play doctor or play “show me yours and I’ll show you mine” because they already know.  They have far fewer unwanted pregnancies because they grow up in an atmosphere where questions are asked and answered openly and honestly. They feel better about their bodies, and more comfortable with their sexuality.  <br>  <br>  Please put away any prejudice for a little while and think how healthy it would be to not have shame or guilt attached to our bodies. <br>  <br>  My wife and I raised 3 wonderful children that were taught that there was no shame or guilt associated with their bodies.  They are now grown and are all great parents in their own right.  All are college graduates, all are professionals in their chosen fields and none of them have ever had any emotional problems because they saw nude people.<br>  <br>  My middle son was a Chaplin in the military and is now an author and very devote Christian.  He advises that God made our bodies, and he can not believe that God would create anything of which we should be ashamed.  Further those that condemn nudity because of Adam and Eve, he simply points out that Jesus died on the cross and erased any sin that may have existed.  He also points out that it was Adam and Eve who hid and were ashamed, God simply asked “Who told you that you were naked?”  God was upset over them eating from the tree of knowledge. Not because they were nude.  He created them naked, and to this day creates each child naked.<br>  <br>  I apologize for such a lengthy response, but as you can easily tell, I have strong opinions regarding what I consider to be our dishonorable actions in teaching children that their bodies are shameful and nudity is not to be seen.  We are not a very moral people, but nudity is not the culprit.

yvPA8FSsaa	I see it as far more frightening than that.  They cannot be that stupid, so there is obviously something else afoot.  Even Bill Clinton is speaking out about it.  The President cannot keep talking down the economy and expect it to recover.  So, it is apparent that President Obama does not want it to recover.  He wants to introduce Socialism.<br>  <br>  For instance, the Stimulus Law that does not stimulate but does empower ACORN and Labor Unions.  It repeals most of the Welfare Reforms put in place in 1994.  It provides large sums of money to State Governments creating "government jobs".  Now, he is intends to raise taxes on wealthy people and businesses.  Since 80% of jobs in the private sector are in small businesses, this will have the effect of increasing unemployment.<br>  <br>  He is methodically deconstructing private industry and having the Federal Government take control.  Once enough people are dependent on the Federal Government for their livelihood they will keep voting in Democrats who are the Party of handouts, surrendering more and more of their Liberty until it is too late.<br>  <br>  Now, if I was President, I would cut taxes on business.  I would have a two year Capital Gains holiday to spur investment and commerce.  I would repeal any unnecessary regulations that hurt business.  I would reinstate the uptick rule for hedge funds.  I would repeal mark to market to allow business better control of thier credit.  <br>  <br>  These are things that would encourage small and medium business to expand and hire.  It would cause the Stock Market to become more attractive to investors and get things moving again.  Not one of these actual stimulus methods is even being considered by Obama.<br>  <br>  Why do you suppose that is?  Are they stupid?  I think not.<br>  <br>  *|`|AA11702773	I don't believe we can, and by this point am not even sure Obama believes we can.

How many of us would borrow that kind of money just to get a job?  Not one of us would, yet it is OK for government to do that.  Foolhardy!<br>  <br>  Dan - It is not just the democrats, the republicans have increased the national debt more than the democrats have.

But that didn't stop Bill Gates from becoming the richest man in the world, and it didn't stop Microsoft from becoming one of the most powerful companies in the world.<br>  <br>  Your exclusive focus on manufacturing overlooks the other ways to generate wealth.

VjgqZetcaa	Breaking and entering (B&E) is a criminal trespass that is also part of the crime of burglary. It does not require actual "breaking" in the sense of damage, but rather "opening" something that was previously closed. It doesn't require a person to actually "enter" the premises, but includes inserting things, throwing things, dropping things, etc.<br>  <br>  So, for example, turning the knob on a house that isn't yours is "breaking" and putting the person's newspaper on the floor inside the door is "entering", so it's a B&E, but not a burglary (because there was no intent to commit a crime while inside).<br>  <br>  Some statutes have enlarged B&E to include all sorts of other cases that would PERMIT you to enter or stay in a place in violation of the owner's wishes.  For example, making a duplicate key that says, "DO NOT DUPLICATE", could be conspiracy to commit B&E and having such an illegal key would be "possession of burglary tools" and evidence of intent to B&E the premises.  Hiding in the bathroom of an office building that is closing is a B&E, because you've already entered and have "broken" the owner's reliance upon the closed doors.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	Don't do it..

Someone out there isn't thinking about what withdrawing prematurely and the consequences of that will mean.<br>      h. McCain will cut earmarks congress places on money after it has been voted on. Neither democrat will. He is a fiscal conservative. He doesn't like spending. Both dems have promised programs that with a poor economy we can't afford. That is like saying you will buy a better car if you are in poverty. It is nice to have the car but you are in worse poverty.<br>      i. You won't have someone in office that listens to anti-American rhetoric and thinks it OK.<br>      g. You won't have someone in office that makes up stories like Clinton who bloviates about experience she doesn't have.  You surely won't have someone who makes up stories like Bush to go to war. From McCain expect the TRUTH. He has a reputation for telling it. What kind of reputation do the Clintons have. He can't even practice law anymore because of it. I didn't sleep with her either!<br>   I could go on and on but there are huge differences between the democrats and McCain. In fact, McCain tries so hard to get good things done conservatives often take issue with him. You see names next to bills he had passed like KENNEDY, FEINSTEIN and more. I'm not sure if the democratic candidates have had any legislation with their name on it pass unless it was naming a bridge. You have the right to vote for anyone, but there is a reason the dems are still banging things out. They aren't the same and their approach to problems is different. They have disenfranchised Fl. and MI voters, and set up a system that surely is an attempt to disregard the will of the people in favor of the party bosses. They have been caught in their own solutions!|`|PpbBz7RLaa	just vote McCain dude, trust me!|`|i2BctT3Iaa	very slight.<br>  <br>  Republicans are more capitolist and democraps are more Marxist socialist.<br>  <br>  A vote for Democrats means higher taxes and less growth.<br>  <br>  Think of it like the old Soviet Union.....lots of government control, taxes, etc means long lines for bread, gas, etc.<br>  <br>  The US has the 2nd highest tax rate in the world for business.<br>  <br>  Why do you think China and India is growing SO much?!|`|xEsXTJeXaa	GET ON YOUR KNEES AND STAY ON YOUR KNEES TILL YOU RECIEVE YOUR ANSWER.

I was on every detail, but never did my job, my new job was driving the army trucks. I filed a couple of EO complaints but it looked like the best thing for me to do was get out and be a Mom.<br>  Usually int he reserves you just play soldier, you have to find someone who needs help and is way behind in their paperwork, or you stay busy by going active duty, thats reality. And stay busy, you will!!!<br>  All the reserve units I have been in have been laid back and do nothing, except around the two week trainign when we actuall moved our whole unit at night and did a night move, that was the only time, we were actually doing something. I have been in three reserve units, so if you wants to saty active you have to go active duty.|`|3Rk6WwEzaa	If you like your job, try going active.

I think you would enjoy it more sense you seem to be a more serious guy. Than again you could have a job that attracts people like those guys and you will just find more of them when you go active.<br>  It is only once a month. So it isn't too bad. 
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Obama has a huge lead in the west coast states (except Alaska, of course) so he is definitely winning those. McCain has a pretty solid lead in most of the Plains and Mt states, so he is probably winning those. So the whole election really depends on what happens in the East. Obama is winning pretty much the whole Northeast by a wide margin. If McCain loses Pennsylvania then it is practically impossible for him to win. If Obama wins Pennsylvania and any one of the other close tossup states in the East (Florida, Virginia, NC, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, NH) then he wins. McCain cannot win unless he wins every one of those. <br>  So, you really just have to watch PA.

He made that alliance during his fight against Saddam Hussein, and still maintains it today.  That is why he won't let us use Iraq as a staging ground for intimidating Iran into backing off its nuclear ambitions.<br>  <br>  Nouri al Maliki's most likely replacement should he lose an election, is Moqtada al Sadr.  Moqtada al Sadr is also allied to Iran.  He and Nouri al Maliki were once allies of each other, and both allied to Iran.  <br>  <br>  That is because both are Shiite, whereas Saddam Hussein was Sunni.  Iran is mostly Shiite, and so backed the Shiite resistance movement, meaning it backed Maliki and al Sadr.  Now both of those individuals remain allied to Iran today.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically, while violence is way down, though not as down as you seem to believe it is, we handed Iraq over to Iranian control.<br>  <br>  <br>  And China was the one to get the oil deals, so Iraq will not be paying us back for our efforts.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And the way Bush paid for the Iraq war, since he would not raise the taxes to pay for it, was to borrow the money from other countries.  And he did this at extremely high (and exponentially growing) interest rates. <br>  <br>  The $600 billion in war operations is all you are told about.  That figure does not include the $500 billion stimulus package Bush gave them, nor does it include the huge amount of interest paid on both sums.<br>  <br>  When Bush got to office, he inherited a $4 trillion National Debt, and a $400 billion surplus in the budget.  When he left office, he had an $11 trillion National debt, and a $500 billion deficit in the federal budget.<br>  <br>  That means that for this war, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE what all 42 of his predecessors needed 224 years to amass.  That is what screwed up our economy, because that huge a rise seriously devalued the dollar (currently at its 16 year low).  Incidentally, do you remember who was in charge of this country 16 years ago?  That would be George H.W. Bush, in the middle of his recession.<br>  <br>  So this is not exactly the resounding victory you believe it be.  So actually, the media is not doing its job.  The media is actually giving Bush a free pass by not pointing out how he handed an enemy a new ally, an economic rival more resources, and our economy a major blow that nearly knocked it out.

AfaFCiKxaa	My own belief is that Israel's behavior can only be understood in the context of the holocaust.  The country was created as the last haven for a people who had been hunted almost to death, and as a nation their possibly excessive fear of some neighbors (hyper-vigilance) and aggressiveness can only be understood in that context.  (A national case of post traumatic stress disorder.)<br>  <br>  Take away the holocaust, and Israel is merely a rogue state.  It is far more complicated than that.<br>  <br>  That's the generous explanation, and probably the one that applies to the government of Iran.|`|aJWjqaAPaa	Proberly can not Believe that the world watched as Six million were Exterminated <br>  <br>  Still find it hard to Believe Even today|`|AA10783710	Some people claim the numbers of victims were grossly exaggerated.  To support this claim, they cite census numbers throughout Europe after the war which indicate there were just about the same number of Jews as before the war, and hence some wholesale annihilation was just a fabricated story.<br>  <br>  They admit to concentration camps, but say disease killed many, and that the crematoriums were a quick and humane way to get rid of bodies that would carry disease.<br>  <br>  Of course, to all this, I say.... BUNK!<br>  <br>  The Nazi atrocities are meticulously well documented.  There is no doubt the holocaust took place.  To this day, thousands of record-keeping books handwritten by the Nazis show who was killed, when and where.  End of story, right?<br>  <br>  But some people rely on the theory that the bigger the lie, the easier it is to pawn it off to the gullible who thrive on conspiracy theories.<br>  <br>  Some people resent the amount of attention given to the Jews, and hence want to minimize the importance of the holocaust.  Others, like the Iranians, desperately want Israel to disappear, and ask why land was stolen from Arabs and Palestinians to give the Jews a homeland in an area that was guiltless.  In other words, if Germany is responsible, why punish the Middle East?  That is their reasoning.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	The Jewish Holocaust is the only historical event that is protected by legislation in the West. When legislation is required to prevent history being challenged, one instinctively questions the robustness of that protected version of history. The prosecution and persecution of those who challenge accounts of history has, until the post war ere been associated only with countries such as the USSR and Red China.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	It's called anti semitism. Those who deny the holocaust happened know damn well that it did happen but want to diminish the horror and make it seem that Israel is being just as bad as the Nazis, when, in fact, the Israelis are running a retaliatory campaign.|`|44AkhdRnaa	To prove their complete lack of knowledge?|`|Xz2R8R1Maa	It's difficult to say what motivates some people.  I would say that some (most?) are probably anti-Semitic, but I know at least one who has latched onto some literature written by a Holocaust denier to work against funding Holocaust memorials and museums with tax dollars.  <br>  <br>  Typically, people who want to redefine history want to do it to promote a certain agenda.  They have a stake in revising history to meet a political goal.  For example, Christian revisionists have tried to rework the opinions of the Founding Fathers of the United States to say that they did not support a separation between state and church.  They quote mine and distort to make it seem as though the Founders wanted a Christian nation.  It's all to make it look like Americans have "fallen away" from our "Christian" roots.<br>  <br>  I would look for the political motivations of any person who engages in historical revisionism.  It probably has to do with funding Holocaust memorials, but if it's not that, it's probably anti-Semitism and/or pro-Nazism.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	The answer to that is simple . . . to "erase" Israel . . . . <br>  <br>  The holocaust was one of the major reasons that the Super-Powers created Isreal.   It happned to the Jews because they had no where to go . . . . no where to flee to.<br>  <br>  America wouldn't grant them visas to enter . . . and the guilt from THAT shameful decision haunted politicans . . . so the created Isreal.<br>  <br>  Now, let's be clear . . .

The Turks butchered Armenians, the Americans practically wiped out the Native Americans.  It wasn't unique, the butchery of Jews, and others, by the Nazis.  <br>  Israel wants to keep it alive because it gives them some specious grounds for their stealing of the Palestinian lands.<br>  It's ironic that the victims of one holocaust should inflict a minor one on their neighbours in Palestine.|`|3ixmHSwmaa	It's not news aimed at the West, at least not for our reindoctrination. It's a propaganda tactic employed by the Madrases while filling the heads of their youth with other lies.<br>  <br>  The West has sworn testimony, Nazi records, video and pictures of the carnage. The little Islamic kiddos will grow up hating us, but maybe one day we can reach them. The facts are compelling to any rational thinking adult.<br>  <br>  We expect mass genocide, starvation and death in progressive countrys like China and the USSR, but we didn't expect it in a traditional Democratic Republic like Germany.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Clive:<br>  That quasi erudite answer sounds very thoughtful, but if you don't mind I'm going to apply Acham's Razor to this one and say the Jews themselves were motivated to insure the world never forgets for the simplest and most obvious reasons, and promoted said legislation through it's passage into law.

They are petrified of the right wing talk show radio hosts like Limbaugh and have proved themselves cowards! Why help Obama if they can get a political point for criticizing him. Their ideology has gotten in the way and the right wing of party is driving them further and further into irrelevancy. This is no longer the party of Reagan, just a mere shadow of it's former self reduced to petty bickering and child like behavior.<br>  <br>  Even the Republican Governors are led by the right. Bobby Jindal is now NOT accepting stimulus money from the Govt., and fabricating lies saying that laws must be permanently changed when in fact all experts tell us it does not and that "sunset" laws are already in place.

The change to requiring seatbelts and child safety seats cost money at first, and the federal government paid for part of that.

So work out, and make sure you qualify for the job you want.  Don't join the Army without checking out all your options and reading all the fine print.|`|AvKlm5DEaa	Generally speaking, no. The Army is mostly men, however there are a fair amount of women. The only ones that are worth even mentioning are pretty much all in a health related MOS. This means that they all go to Fort Sam Houston for AIT. I'm a 68W (medic) and I am currently at Ft Sam for my AIT and I have to say, pretty much every attractive woman in the Army is here. Its pretty nice to actually see a female in uniform that isn't more of a man than you are. I knew a female drill sergeant and I'm almost positive she had a penis.|`|5480368f891cf2ee3378b391baeaa558aa	i am not sying to join the military to meet girls but if that what you are trying for tje airforce is alot better there are alot hotter women and alot more of them.|`|KwpDdKIeaa	If your gona join the army just to meet girls you've either got huge problems getting women or you've had every girl in your area.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	what are you 14|`|uurgL3oZaa	There are some, but in general, joining the military isn't something that helps you meet women. College is a much better place for that.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	It depends would be the most appropriate answer. If you get assigned to a place like Germany you will have many opportunities to meet girls. If on the other hand, you get deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, your chances will be extremely low. And if you think you want to date a female soldier you will have alot of competition because in a deployment zone your odds are very low.<br>  <br>  If I can be honest and you want to travel the world to meet girls from all over your best option would be the Navy. You will go to many foreign ports and be allowed liberty on shore where you will get to go to all kinds of places. Plus you might get some shore duty in Japan, Italy, or Spain to just name a few. But that's just my opinion. Others may have a different view.|`|DYnvacFVaa	I would imagine you would have more chance of meeting a girl out of the army then in, i would think women in the army would have to be fairly tough and interested in a career more so then meeting a man.|`|sVrkjixAaa	Think of the ratio of girls to guys in the army. Then think of the amount of discipline that soldiers have. <br>  <br>  So no.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Lots of exotic dancers live near all major Army installations.

kTOJ9XYcaa	The other side is not sincerely giving anything in return for peace.  Therefore, why should Israel waste their time.  The Palestinians are the ones setting back any possibility to resolve the issues for peace.<br>  <br>  DTG|`|E9XL5x3Paa	It may not.  In fact, it may even speed up the process.  If done correctly.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Have you ever heard the saying, "Only Nixon could go to China."<br>  <br>  Well that references the fact that the first American President to visit Communist China was Richard Nixon; one of the biggest outspoken critics of China.  But his visiting there was one of the first steps toward normalization of Chinese-American relations.  A partnership that has benefited both countries greatly, and has brought a large amount of Capitalism to China.  It was precisely because the hawkish Nixon came back to America with his mind changed, that convinced the American people to give China a chance here.  The same happened in China when they saw us and how we live, and we both came off the better for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  I suspect that the hawkish Benjamin Netanyahu could serve a similar role in Israeli-Palestine relations.  He could be the man that changes minds.  I have not lost hope that this could be the time.  I know the odds are against it, but I actually found Netanyahu to be a thinking and clear-headed individual in the interviews I've seen him in.<br>  <br>  Hawkish though he may be, I don't believe he is deadset on war if he believes it can be avoided.  Which makes him a prime candidate for a peace process, just as Nixon was with China.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Hopefully his administration will be the end of the foolish notion of a two state "solution".How many more lives do you want to waste on this goal?

He is tough and super smart.I have a lot of hope for Israel in his hands.<br>  An undivided Israel with the Star of David flying proudly over over it should be the goal of the whole world.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	The set backs can be directly attributed to Hamas and their ilk, not the Israeli government, who have already offered land for peace only to be turned down with suicide bombers and rockets as a reply.

Israel has been attempting 2 achieve peace for a long time, the left wing approach at peace obviously is ineffective (as seen when Gush Katif was given 2 the Palestinians). Hopefully Netanyahu will continue peace talks without giving away Israeli land (that only seems to make Israel easier targets).

And depending on the manner and means by which the money was taken it certainly could be unethical and/or illegal.<br>  <br>  It is perfectly acceptable to request money for those less fortunate.  But a rational, logical person would not advocate wealth distribution because socialism simply does not work.  If there is no incentive to work for and earn your income, a large portion of the population simply won't work.  (Take a look at professional welfare collectors.  This country has third and fourth generations collecting welfare now.  Where is their incentive to get an education, develop skills, and get a job when they get money for nothing?  Does anyone really think that these folks will spontaneous develop a worth ethic?)<br>  <br>  I worked two jobs to put myself through school.  I didn't get pregnant until my husband and I were able to afford to raise our children.  We clipped coupons, saved money, and have lived financially responsible lives.

I've seen a lot of this before, and I can understand your side of it.<br>  <br>  The problem is that you are assuming that people are only poor because they don't want to work hard, and that is a very sad, and incorrect proposition. There are plenty of people that are poor, and no amount of hard work will change their situation - there is no "endless ocean of success" just waiting to be plundered. Do people in this country have opportunity? Perhaps more so than other countries, but the fact remains that there are just not enough good jobs out there for everyone to make a comfortable living, and now you are blaming the victim(s).|`|FSsl25SLaa	Perfect. A nation prospers through wealth CREATION, not wealth RESDISTRIBUTION. Otherwise society simply consumes, and does not produce.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I agree with it myself, i don't believe we should steal from the rich to give to the poor, seeing as how the rich are generally already giving us jobs and creating a generally stability in the middle class. The trickle down effect is not to make the middle class rich, it's to keep the middle class stable, you start "spreading the wealth" the rich retaliate for the loss of money, whether it be taking away jobs or raising costs causing more instability in the working middle class. I am middle class, i would prefer to remain middle class rather than be made poor by instability of job retaliation.<br>  <br>  Then when you have the lazy who won't work and just want to be supported by the working class, it's sick.|`|848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	I'm no necon, but we must admit that human nature is such that if hard work and responsible living are punished and bad spending habits or laziness are rewarded, the economy of that society will not survive. People only produce if they see the rewards of their labor.<br>  What;'s taken from those who have, SHOULD be shared with the truly disabled, those temporarily out on their luck, and the elderly, not able bodied people who drink, do drugs and plop baby after baby into the receiving end of the system.<br>  We should share as a society, but have to have a system in place so that this sharing doesn't turn into the detriment of the givers or the receivers because hushing people into complacency by taking away their drive to work isn't exactly doing them any favors either. We must have limitations so that we don't allow our welfare system to become an incentive for lack of productivity.<br>  I'm also equally against bailing out the rich... the banks and the car companies. That's not going to help anyone in the long term because there is nothing like facing economic disaster for a corporation to rethink and reinvent itself to the benefit of the consumer.|`|Ocyrox5baa	It's why the founders risked everything trying to instill ethics in and out of government in this great country.

ezQ44NqAaa	Hasn't he already proposed more of the same?He's already talking about what I call the "Pay your neighbors mortgage" plan,at another 75 Billion,and you can bet that will be over 200 Billion when it's done.<br>  <br>  And you can bet there will be more of the "Stimulus" bills,but I think from here on,he will keep them smaller,like 300 Billion at a time.After all,now Americans have accepted watching a Trillion Dollars get thrown in a hole,300 Billion will not even faze them.<br>  <br>  AD|`|Alkn6IJYaa	I don't believe so, but the stimulus package was not small enough to do a lot good. However, it was small because the Republicans, and their whores in the media, conspired to convince people the bill was 'pork' - as if that was really possible. It also contained too many tax cuts, for similar reasons.<br>  <br>  The fact is that Obama misjudged the manipulation of the Republican Noise machine. He thought if he went and did what the economists told him to do, he could simply pass the plan quickly and get things moving. Instead, the Republicans lied and said the bill was full of 'pork' like spending on education, health and poverty programs - as if education, heath and poverty programs should not be central in spending bill in the middle of the longest recession since the Great Depression.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Once he gets his budget through he will start working on more stimulus money and the idea has already been floated by many of his advisers so yes the back up is more stimulus funding.   He will keep it smaller but the total will be as high or higher then this one when all is said and done.  He is following the FDR plan and that is what was done there with many economist agreeing that FDR's policies extended the Great Depression.  Yes they made it easier for some a short period of time but actually extended and deepened the Great Depression.  The problem is not that this was "too small" but that the current stimulus package dies little to help the economy in general and very little benefit quickly.  Counting the total value of the tax breaks as getting to people quickly but not actually getting the money out in total but small amounts weekly is a little deceptive and is not a boost to the economy.  Most building projects will not start for over a year. The largest effect of the "infrastructure" money should hit about the time of the mid-term elections so the biggest effect might be to make people look good.  Too much of the things being funded are pork-sorry but I do love my dogs but I can think of many infrastructure improvements that should rank higher then doggy walk parks and many other of the proposed repairs and improvements.  We will see how many of the improvements end up in the political supporters yards and have been tried to be earmarked or inserted in bills in the past.  The big thing to me is signing an Executive Order privately with no coverage that give the 15% of the construction business that is unionized preference in getting government contracts does seem to be nothing but pay back.

1KGXts5Daa	I have served court papers (in California).  The act of serving the papers is actually quick and easy.  Sometimes the tough part is getting over the nervous feeling just prior to serving them.<br>  <br>  What helps me a lot is to imagine that I am simply working for a delivery company like FedEx, UPS, or the Postal Service and I'm just delivering a Priority Package which I know nothing about.<br>  <br>  You do not need to identify yourself; although I have no problem with giving my first name, if asked.<br>  <br>  Since private firms (process services) do this all the time without knowing anything about the matter that they are serving papers on, you do not have to (and should not) identify your friend or the reason for the service (remember, you're just the "delivery person" with a "priority package" - that's all you know).<br>  <br>  I have had success with this approach: "Hi, are you...full name as listed on court docs...? <br>  <br>  When they say "yes", then I say (as I am handing them a sealed envelope containing the documents, which has their name printed on it, and the words "personal action required"): "Here you go."<br>  <br>  That's it.  You have completed your required duty when they take possession of the envelope.  Turn and leave.<br>  <br>  I always make sure to have a friendly smile on my face, a pleasant tone of voice, and pretend I am handing them a present from their favorite relative.<br>  <br>  Everything about the interaction should convey "casual".  Nothing about it should convey "official".<br>  <br>  Any question they may ask should be answered from the frame of mind that: You are just the delivery person. You know your name, and not much else.<br>  <br>  (...and that you have to be on your way to your next delivery)|`|2a9MLpZRaa	You should look them in the eye and say "OOOHHH SNAP YOU JUST GOT SERVED".|`|VjgqZetcaa	All you need to say is, "Hello, are you John Smith?", the person named in the papers, and then, "You are being served." as you hand him the papers.<br>  <br>  If the person denies being John Smith, you can ask who he is and if he can accept service of process for John Smith.  If you're at their place of residence, you can (in theory) leave them with any competent adult and return the service stating that's what happened.<br>  <br>  Depending upon local rules, you may have to do more to make sure you have the right John Smith, if you're not at their place of residence or workplace.<br>  <br>  If the person asks who you are, you can say you're the person serving them papers and leave it at that.|`|1c2ff0589d655a36a936d6af96fb7116aa	Not a good idea to give your name<br>   Make sure you have the right person and say "these are for you" if asked what they are about , you have no idea|`|ZzcGlrtCaa	You've been served.<br>    Never seen or heard about it in real life, just what Ive seen on TV and we know how they blow that crap out of proportion. <br>    Could call some lawyers and get their insite on how a good way is to do it.

You cannot put innocent Palestinians who aren't allowed to leave their homes, making them vulnerable to attacks, in the same category as terrorist factions like Hamas.  <br>  <br>  I know a Palestinian fella who lives here in the U.S., he is so afraid that people are going to call him a terrorist that whenever he brings up his origin, he makes sure he says "I'm not a terrorist, I'm a Christian. I'm on your side."<br>  <br>  People who blame an entire race of people for the actions of a few are bigots in their own right.<br>  <br>  And the hatred toward Jews has been more prevalent than hatred toward Islam in this society, you have to admit that.  There are many people in the Muslim world who want all Jews dead.

q5LV120Gaa	I'd like to see a Mike Huckabee/Ken Blackwell ticket, I agree with Blackwell almost 100%, but man, Michael Steele really stands up to Obama!  He's got just the attitude Republicans needed right now.|`|ExCAedp4aa	If that helps you sleep better at night, go right ahead. But Steele will not only never be President, he has virtually no chance at securing the GOP nomination. He's mentioned because evidently, Republicans have a tough time naming politicians in their own party.<br>  <br>  Edit: Well aware of that, but you should know that no sitting chairman has ever been nominated by the party as their presidential candidate and only one former chair became President, George H.W.Bush (16 years after he left it). In other words, you should probably be basically aware that the chairman of the GOP is not usually considered any sort of serious Presidential Candidate.|`|eIbPSsy9aa	I'm tired of neoconservatives - give me someone old-skool: another Teddy Roosevelt, McKinley, Coolidge or even Hoover. I'm through with reform liberals too...Nixon was the one who 'effed up the economy, Carter just tried doing the same things Nixon did, which only made it worse. Reagan's was a short-term solution - in the long run, how can deregulation NOT lead to another market collapse? But it did solve stagflation.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure what Obama's policies are, but an effective income redistribution would be great for the economy.  I don't mean welfare, I mean taxes on the super-rich that go to the middle class and give us money to buy things, which in turn keeps our corporate juggernauts afloat.  Economics 101 - supply and demand, wages and prices.   Too much production, not enough demand, jobs are lost, people can't buy things.  In the Great Depression, everything was dirt-cheap, but no one had any money - prices can only go so low b/c of the cost of capital goods. It's a cycle, that can only be solved by making sure people can buy things (preferably with cash.)|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Oh you know what, since he was on television I've been thinking about how long it would take for someone else to ask if Micheal Steele would run for President in 2012.

I'm still hoping I'm wrong. My younger two kiddos aren't through high school yet and the financial back-sliding is hurting their college plans.<br>  <br>  A Michael Steele or Bobby Jindal would be a vast improvement, and it's important that we get one of them in 2012. Jindal's brain runs circles around Obama's. He was accepted to Harvard Medical and Yale Law. How often does that happen? What's even more amazing is he turned them both down and took a different path. He has already been a US Senator and he is currently governor of Louisiana. He's cleared out the corruption and is lauded by most in his state. Jindal is the son of immigrant parents so birthright is in question. What do you want to bet that Bobby will gladly grant us access to the vault copy of his birth certificate? LOL<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Actually ThugLife, I'm the type that keeps harping for Jindal, but a Steele - Obama race in 2012 would be interesting.<br>  In the '08 race, 94% of blacks voted for Obama. According to the media, it was because blacks tend to be Democrat, and they preferred his stand on the issues over McCain's. It really wasn't about race.<br>  Okay, if you say so media...<br>  Then explain this to me. Why if Clinton and Obama were nearly identical twins on the issues during the primary, like the media said, did 92% of blacks vote for Obama?<br>  In the interest of sociology, I would like to see what the black voters would do in a Steele vs. Obama election race.|`|AA10124897	I'd like to see someone who is able to fix messes... for what it's worth, Mike Huckabee, was able to fix what Clinton left the state of Arkansas in... When Clinton was elected president, Arkansas was second only to Alaska as being the worst in the nation.  We are going to have a lot of good people in both houses of congress as well.  I would hope this stimulus bill was enough to wake the country up to what we have on the hill... Representing us... That's a joke.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	I hope someday you get over this burning hate you have.<br>  <br>  Right now, I am interested to see if the GOP can survive all this.  They were crushed in the elections because of the past 8 years, and the voters were just plain angry at them playing politics as opposed to doing what was best for everyone (just like they are doing right now).  They are not changing at all, and they are trying to show they stand for something, but no one is really interested in political stance right now - they want the economy fixed and want it done soon.<br>  <br>  The GOP has put themselves into the position that if the stimulus plan works (and it might - the odds are in its favor overall), they are going to have a PR nightmare.  None of the Republicans in congress showed support (sans 3), and there are a lot of people that voted for them that are losing their jobs and homes.  If this works, they are going to have a lot of explaining to do, and not many are going to be happy with their reasoning.<br>  <br>  Yes - I voted for Obama.  But it is all ridiculous to sit there and label everything Republican, Democrat, Conservative or Liberal.  We all want the same thing.  How is it that if someone tries a way to achieve what we all want they are wrong??  No one knows the right answer.  All that it shows are those thinking that Obama is wrong are narrow minded and not looking for a way to solve this problem - they are a part of the problem, not the solution.|`|noo8vpvzaa	I really, REALLY like, respect and admire Steele...He is more intelligent and has a MUCH better background than Obama...He's very fiscally conservative, and he makes a terrific RNC Chair, I'm extremely glad that he won that position<br>  <br>  However...He isn't really the best choice for president (at least in the Republican party)...I believe that many conservatives will have problems with his stance on affirmative action and the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Of course, if the choice was between Steele and Obama...I'd vote for Steele in a heartbeat.|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	I think that Obama will give us a new President to be conservative for 8 years.

It is no more likely that Steele will become president next than Howard Dean. Hell, the man's only experience in government is as a Lt. Governor. <br>  <br>  Seriously, the only reason why you bringing up Steele is because somehow you think nominating a black man will make any difference, it won't.<br>  <br>  Besides, in case you haven't noticed is that it took a moron like Bush to get us an Obama. We've already passed our dark days of piss poor government and have someone now willing to go to work and not go on vacation.

Also, Carter let inflation go wild where interest rates were 20% by the time that Reagan got into office.  Also, just because you don't like Bush doesn't mean that he had dismal failures.  He did keep the Country safe for seven years which Clinton could not do.  He also warned Congress many times about the housing bubble but Congress did not listen.|`|AA11210239	In essence, last November, the majority of Americans voted for a second term of President Carter.

It's over and done with.

As time has told the Iranians are unpredictable at best, dangerous at worst, to this day.<br>  The Iranians released the hostages two hours after Reagan took office, and you'd have thought Reagan hung the moon.  It was just Irans way of thumbing its nose.  And they fell for it.<br>  Carter also had the Camp David agreements which have pretty much held to this day.  He also had an oil embargo, and a host of other problems.

They dig deep when it comes to proving your marriage is legitimate! We had to provide photos of us dating, marriage license, utility bills with both our names printed on them... all sorts of things.

You say you love this guy; obviously, we cant choose who we fall in love with, but to even consider talking of getting married to someone "just so he can stay in the country" is very cruel, on your behalf and the other person. It's a rather selfish act, and think of how that other person will feel; used if she ever finds out.<br>  <br>  I agree with you about some people here who sponge off the state, it makes me sick too, but please remember that the majority of folk in Britain are hard working, though I back you up 100% in regards to the government!<br>  <br>  I really think he should renew his visa and come clean. It's not fair on anyone otherwise. You will have heard the saying "There's no such thing as a free lunch", and this should apply to EVERYBODY both legal in the country AND illegal. Otherwise, I see no other option but you both running the risk of immigration finding out and risk him being deported, which clearly you dont want! Hope it all goes ok.|`|P9wE9XZlaa	In US there is no other way..<br>  i know many guys did that ....got married and earned the status...he could get a job offer from some where..and work visa is one option which is not easy at all..|`|c30e7d5dc21c881fa2b4e10f9ca03ee5aa	what nation is he from, ill be able to give you a quick answer when i find that out.|`|zaRcsUwNaa	You say you want advice to do the right thing well the right thing is most certainly not to encourage him to stay here illegally regardless of Your feelings ,you must see that is is wrong ,he is already saying he may have to marry someone Else to stay here this is wrong and does not really say much for You does it?,I think you need to take off the rose coloured glasses and look at this romance for what it is ,and i am sorry to say that you are enabling this situation dump him and move on.He is making a fool of you.|`|ZYr66mvhaa	I totally agree ith you.

AA12349988	The banks where not bailed out to recover the lost assets form non payment of UK mortgages - it was to ensure the banks didn't go bust taking savers money with them!!!<br>  <br>  RBS - lost ￡28 billion last year HBoS ￡11 billion (that is 39 thousand million pounds) just on those two banks - there where 40 thousand reposessions last year - you do the math!<br>  <br>  Some of the debt is not in this country - much of the mortgage arrears on the books of UK banks is tied up in the US sub prime market.  RBS lost ￡20 billion in buying a share in a Dutch bank a few months ago.<br>  <br>  Additionally the banks will not get back all their assets from the people whose houses they repossess.  If Joe Blogs owes ￡100,000 on his house and it is only worth ￡85,000 now the bank looses ￡15,000 and whilst it will persue Joe for it the chances of them getting it are very small.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is unclear yet how much exposure the banks are exposed to these two things - it is clear that those with the riskier attitude to lending have been the hardest hit.  But it is clear that if they weren't bailed out then savers with Northern Rock, Bradford and Bingley, HBoS, RBS and Lloyds TSB would have lost all their savings as these banks would have been bankrupted.  The government had no choice other than nationalise or part nationalise them.  I think it has become clear that bonus are going to rightly very small this year.|`|oLz4jYXqaa	The banks WILL eventually get back their money. It the interim period that is the problem when they face cash-flow problems like anyone who is caught short. They can't lose, unless they are left to sink like Lehman Bros. That's why they can act with impunity and get away with it. We have to bail them out  because they are the only conduit of money supply in a capitalist state. Cut it off and we are stuck. That's why socialism is the better way, and its the way the state has to resort when we are in trouble.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I read an article about a bank executive who said that the real reason for the bailout wasn't to cover the bad assets, but it was so the bigger banks could buy up the smaller banks. It's all part of nationalizing them.

cl9Ghxrlaa	Sure you are entitled to them.  Have you threatened her with bringing the law into it before and it hasn't worked?  If so, I don't see why you can't go over there with a police escort to retrieve your belongings.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry your mom is that way.  Maybe she will mellow with the years.  My parents were rather control freakish, too, when I was your age.  But they mellowed out when they got used to the idea that I was out on my own, married, and had children of my own to attend to.<br>  <br>  As other posters have said, you can always get transcripts and you don't need a whole heck of a lot to enlist, but those are your things.  You shouldn't have to go through the trouble of getting new documents and possibly paying for them if you already have them at home with mom!|`|AA12384954	Not in your country probably, but best thing to do would be get on the phone immediately to the births and deaths office, and order a new birth certificate pronto.  It will cost but no one would be allowed to take that off of you, to be sure.  Can you call your old school; surely they would copy and post out a new report if you cannot locate your original?  Do these two things today to speed up the process.  There is always a way to replace documents that have gone amiss, even if the originals are being coveted by a mother.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want to bother the police on these issues.  I don't think they can help you much personally anyway.  I imagine that holding someone's passport is illegal, so maybe they would at least ring her for you.  If this has gone "missing" there is always a way to get a replacement urgently, so get the other two things done immediately for id purposes.  She probably paid for the birth certificate so it's probably hers to do with as she wishes.  Let your mother enjoy the short lasting pleasure of being difficult.  Don't fall for playing her games; just get wiser to her ways, and stay one step ahead.  She wins if you end up arguing with her, so just ignore the nuisance factor, keep calm and remain independent.  We don't get to chose our parents, but we don't have to put up with their ways if they get too silly.  Hopefully you won't adopt her ways in the future.  Good luck!|`|6ogBfBmpaa	I would try to secure new documents myself.<br>  <br>  Go to your local document building/court house whatever and they will give you a legal copy of your birth certificate.<br>  <br>  Then head to your high school and they can give you a transcript which should be good enough. A diploma is only for looks, really.<br>  <br>  Then get a new passport.<br>  <br>  I just think you should try to do whatever you can without legal action. Let that be a last resort.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	I'm in the Regular Army and you do not need a passport to enlist. Go to your high school and get proof of your graduation.

I've received one speeding ticket in the last 7 years and it just so happens to be after this change.  No where on the ticket does it say anything even about points, let alone how many will be assessed to my license.  It doesn't even have the fine amount on the ticket, but this does not change the fact that there will be a fine and points will be put on your license.  You need to check with your local/state governments website and search for their traffic violation point system as this varies from state to state.

But maybe she's always been a lonely person, never really met anyone who pays her attention before and so she's latching onto you? She might not realise how weird her behaviour is if she hasn't really had many friends before. I would first try to gauge her reaction to you letting her down. Next time she turns up at your door, say 'oh I'm heading out to -insert friends name here- place in a min so you can't stay for long' and if she tries to invite herself over to your friends place just say she can't just turn up there because it's rude when she hasn't been invited?!

FpWqQE3maa	We all have been victims to Indian bureaucracy and corruption at one time or the other. Applying for a passport, driver’s license, telephone connection, Khata certificate, Ration card, etc all can be nightmarish experiences for an average Indian. To escape the long queues and complicated procedures you must either be rich with good ability to grease some palms or you must be well connected (with the high and mighty). If you aren’t either, in order to survive you must be thick skinned, patient, and must carry no sense of ego and self respect.

CZlUhRfkaa	The 24hr waiting period to report a missing person is a myth.  You can report someone missing at any time.  What happens at my agency is personal information of the missing person would be taken and the person would be entered into the nationwide law enforcement database.  what that does if any law enforcement agency runs into her and runs her name a "hit" would come back as a missing person.  It would also assign a detective to the case and they would follow up for further.  Information you can obtain about possible whereabouts should be followed up by the appropriate law enforcement agency as a welfare check to see if she is there.  If you believe she might be in danger that will step it up a notch.  Usually concerned family members would do some detective work themselves and maybe call the airline in the morning to see if she got on the plane, etc.  Her not picking up her luggage, etc. would be something the detective would work on but it should be made known to the law enforcement agency.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps with your screenplay!|`|Du8QhOmaaa	Haha i dont think so.

The Western world has been shaped by Christian ideologies and the wealth of the church has resulted in a form of banking leading to Capitalism. In the Middle East, Jewish and Muslim ideologies led to the formation of many of the states and are much stronger leading to beliefs in how people behave in society. The will and power of the church in Europe led to most of the societies being patriarchal in which women were discriminated against. Most of it comes down to the power of the religious organization behind the ideology which in turn leads to the link between church and the power of a monarchical state. Leaders of these states were believed to be blessed by the god of their chosen religion. Parliaments were created by state and church to deal with these affairs and politics arose from there.<br>  <br>  This is all I have to say.

I think we can all agree on that.  However, your claim that Clinton had record surpluses is untrue.  Look at the Treasury website for the true figures.  Clinton skewed the numbers but he had 4 surpluses to start with and ended with none.  <br>  <br>  When has Clinton ever told the truth?  This is what really happened.<br>  <br>  The claim is generally made that Clinton had a surplus of $69 billion in FY1998, $123 billion in FY1999 and $230 billion in FY2000 . In that same link, Clinton claimed that the national debt had been reduced by $360 billion in the last three years, presumably FY1998, FY1999, and FY2000--though, interestingly, $360 billion is not the sum of the alleged surpluses of the three years in question ($69B + $123B + $230B = $422B, not $360B).<br>  <br>  While not defending the increase of the federal debt under President Bush, it's curious to see Clinton's record promoted as having generated a surplus. It never happened. There was never a surplus and the facts support that position. In fact, far from a $360 billion reduction in the national debt in FY1998-FY2000, there was an increase of $281 billion.<br>  <br>  Verifying this is as simple as accessing the U.S. Treasury website where the national debt is updated daily and a history of the debt since January 1993 can be obtained.|`|AA10239305	You are deluded.

You think someone "from the secretary pool" could be less reliable a source than say.... liar Tony Snow or liar Scott McClellan?<br>  <br>  Just so you know, dude - there are MILLIONS of "secretaries" all over this damn country who pretty much RUN the companies they work for.<br>  <br>  Who else would you like to diss this morning?
AA11702773	To the extent of policing fraud, yes.  To the extent of passing judgment, no.|`|oojO4WAraa	To some degree.  Let's say there is a 92 year old man (that isn't your father or any relative - leave out the emotion) and his family wants to keep him alive at all costs, though there will be no improvement in his condition and he is not conscious.  Shoud Medicare pay $300,000.00 to prolong the guys life, when there is no reasonable expectation of improvement just because the family is not ready to let go?  I say no, the government should have limits medical care.  If the family was footing the bill themselves - then it would be for them to say, but if Medicare (tax dollars) are used I think the government should be able to set limits.|`|k6hicodfaa	With the amount of people who are uninsured or underinsured--yes.  There needs to be reform of some kind--whether it is simply legislation or universal coverage.  We need something.  The number of people in their 20s without coverage is staggering and means a future unhealthy workforce.  How can we take care of the future generation if we are unable to care for ourselves as companies no longer offer insurance and we can't afford to pay 400 a month for insurance.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	Your question is kind of vague but Yes, and in case it has slipped past some, the government is doing that now.|`|Ar7swtCPaa	NO|`|25d8bcbbded34c8e695bc727dc17257eaa	Well the problem at hand is money. Who is willing to pay for all this. Just some numbers. In united States over 1.7 trillion dollars is spent each year wear as in Countries like Canada only 160 billion is spent. Actually, United States pays the most world wide. It is also the country that has little regulations gearing their health care (yes Canada has long waiting lines but in United States you have to be dying to get service if you do not have the money). Sadly enough to say with moral hazard someone should regulate the health care system. If you are going to die in 2 months and keeping alive for 1 more month costs over 20 grand, should that money be spent?|`|ITF52tu9aa	There should be minimal standards regulation. <br>  <br>  Communicating the pricing of treatment should be mandatory- too often physicians ask if a patient wants treatment without discussing how much it costs. Alternative treatments versus potential benefits and affordability should also be discussed. <br>  <br>  Medical bills should be itemized so people know what they're paying for.  And the influence that drug representatives have on diagnosis and subsequent treatment needs much discussion and oversight. This is an area where blanket capitalism fails- as drug companies often dictate practice in the way they provide financial incentives for physicians. Diagnosis and treatment should be based on the doctor-patient relationship- not outside financial interests. Playing ostrich and pretending this doesn't occur (it does constantly) doesn't help either. <br>  <br>  I also think drug advertising needs a long hard look.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	I think the government should provide oversight rather than regulation. <br>  <br>  Oversight could address and derail fraud, ensure that insurance companies make health policies available to all, and ensure that pricing remains fair and equitable, without taking away the patient's personal rights.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	It already does in many ways.  Doctors have to be licensed to practice medicine.  Hospitals have to document their activities to qualify as tax-exempt.  <br>  <br>  If the government did not regulate health care in some ways, people would be at the mercy of quacks.|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	Of course!<br>  <br>  All heath care should be standardized lest folks born with silver spoons in their mouths get the best of care while most struggling Americans get shabby health care. <br>  <br>  This is evidenced by America's County Hospitals where people can wait in an Emergency Room for 24 hours or more before they are seen by a doctor.<br>  <br>  .|`|D5A9JUDMaa	No.<br>  <br>  Should they tell you what kind of CAR you can have?... what quality of meats you can eat?....  what temperature you set your thermostat on?....  what type of shoes or clothing you can wear?|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	Better than the insurance companies who we pay thousands of dollars a year to, only to be denied.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Nope, that should be between the patient and the doctor|`|643690e719bebc4e02e9a16b4d8f1189aa	Of course!

I assume it would add a lot of headaches.<br>  <br>  PS  DC cannot be admitted as a state or given voting representatives without a constitutional amendment.|`|hiCSVwchaa	If you suddenly included the entire population of DC as part of the population of Maryland, you'd still have to reapportion Congressmen, as they're based on population.  Which means that Maryland might get another Congressman, and another state might lose one.<br>  <br>  Nobody is talking about giving DC statehood, merely tweaking the Constitution so that it doesn't require statehood for Congressional representation.<br>  <br>  ETA:  How do you plan to just wave a magic wand and "make" DC part of Maryland?|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Washington D.C. was created as a Federal Property in order to prevent the government from favoring any one state over the other (if the government was based in Ohio, for example, it may predispose the lawmakers to treat Ohio more favorably than any other state). D.C. was never supposed to be an area inhabited by civilians but rather a place where the federal elected officials would exist (kind of like a limbo).<br>  <br>  Making it a state is a completely ridiculous proposition which is sponsored by the historically ignorant and power hungry.|`|OdrgLFFOaa	There is no push to make DC a state although I fail to see why that would be stupid.  DC merely wants voting representation in congress which seems fair to residents who are the only citizens of the United States who are not represented by a member of congress with voting rights|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Because Virginia would be pissed.|`|GajMYWR9aa	The main reason is because we would be forced to give Maryland additional representatives who, because of DC, would be Democrats. If you look in the past, Democrats have been in favor of doing this, while Republicans oppose it because of the new votes the Dems would have. I think it would be a very bad idea, though.

Did you do anything to try to stop that costly war?|`|3MM64geHaa	The cause. The cause is to grow a more powerful federal govt. To do that, they must ruin the rich while enabling the poor and creating more entitlement.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Neither. Like Republicans, they are for themselves.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	The word is "Democratic."  It's an adjective.  In the English language we distinguish adjectives from nouns.  Try it sometime.<br>  <br>  Your question is too vague to make sense.  I'm not sure what "cause" your'e talking about.|`|Sd7c0867aa	I believe they are for the "Cause" but they realize that everything comes with a price tag that will need to be funded.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	Their Cause is to march away from Capitalism and the US constitution through Socialism and arrive at Communism with the Democrat Party being the Communist Ruling Party.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Because like most Democrats. Schumer only listens to those people who agree with him. Anything contrary to his opinion is relegated to the lunatic fringe. The worst failing of Democratic politicians is their arrogant belief that they are going to save us from ourselves, regardless of our objections to their policies or positions. It is not just Schumer though. Look at all the current leadership and their statements regarding public opinion on policy and you will see a pattern of self delusion developing.|`|RtHq6y78aa	I actually called his office to TELL HIM that I CARE!<br>  <br>  I just don't think he could justify all the PORK and said the first stupid thing that came to his mind.

If most Americans don't care about the pork then maybe I shouldn't either.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	Like most of them, elitist scum|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Because he's an idiot. He just wants you to think American's don't care so you feel isolated and abandon your negative view on it.|`|AA11424005	Schmucky Chucky likes to talk.  He likes face time on TV.

Upstate NY has the 2nd highest poverty rate because of the bull that these Democrats pull. They constantly feel the need for More taxes, more spending and despite horrendous results keep getting elected because government unions run this state. It works. Keep promising everyone the treasury.<br>  <br>  This state re-elected Hillary Clinton in a landslide despite accomplishing nothing that she promised. Liberal Fascism from the press who think it's light and funny that the woman promised 200,000 jobs upstate and we lost 50,000. Free Pass. The voters are uneducated and believe the government will give them everything. Something the Liberals refuse to acknowledge.

He actually believes that we Americans "do" think and care about said pork but is trying to convince us otherwise, and we do believe and we do care. If he can convince enough people that their neighbors do not care, maybe they shouldn't either.  A typical liberal ploy, lie, lie, lie, and if necessary, lie some more. Character flaws are often revealed in the small details. This is what Chuck Schumer is all about.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Why does Chuck Schumer think Americans don't care about the pork thats in the stimulus bill?"<br>  <br>  I'll tell you why he thinks that. It's because Schumer is a career politician who has never been voted out of office. As a matter of fact, he usually gets re-elected with 70-80 percent of the votes. He looks at his election successes and can only conclude that the people who voted him in couldnt care less that he is a big fan of pork.<br>  <br>  The only way to teach Schumer a lesson otherwise is for the voters to kick him out of office, and thats not happening.|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	CHUCK SCHUMER IS A TYPICAL NY LIBERAL POLITICIAN COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY.

Don't know how anyone votes for him.|`|9PAavWnyaa	Because Schumer is out of touch AND is an idiot.<br>  He could also be basing his asssessment of Americans on the fact that so many voted for an empty suit in the presidential election.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Because most Americans are too worried about their own back yard being kept as theirs and <br>  .<br>  Not bank owned<br>  .|`|hMLmrPbgaa	Americans do care about pork in the bill...<br>  <br>  ...THEY WANT MORE!|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	Because old Chuck is a smuck and for some reason he has a belief that we as Americans are stupid..
OHs8yJiOaa	There's certainly more information out there, and it's often tougher for someone to control their own image and hearsay, etc., than once upon a time. The amount of media is certainly impacting those willing to enter professions like politics, and the amount of information is certainly impacting human relations, the (lack of) character and hard work people now have to demonstrate before they get entrusted with information, etc.<br>  <br>  BUT....<br>  <br>  Information on places like Facebook and Myspace is there voluntarily, and is outright how someone themselves publically discloses information about themselves. It's not at all unusual for businesses to believe that one's life is interconnected, and that what someone does in their private life can impact their work performance and reflect poorly on the rest of the operation. Yes, once upon a time people drank on the weekend or whatnot and a business usually looked the other way or considered it "normal." Now, they've learned the various ways that actually comes back over time to negatively impact one's work... even if it's just that a client or someone comparable can readily find drunk photos of you, etc., just like they can. It's voluntarily publically-published information.<br>  <br>  No, they don't have the right to go poking around someone's home and the like. However, if someone is so "reckless" as to post drunk/naked photos of themselves on a public website, it doesn't say a lot about their judgement in "public" professional situations, either.<br>  <br>  The truly absurd thing is how much information about themselves people are willing to give away for free just because they want "attention" or something. Once upon a time, people understood the value of privacy and discretion and taste. And it's now absurd that people go blast questionable things about themselves to the world and then act surprised when there are consequences. Once upon a time, people took great care about every single word they might present publically. Now, not so much. Far from it.<br>  <br>  Yes, we're going to be looking at issues in the future with political figures and other leaders and the kinds of photos, videos, texts, emails, etc. that are out there documenting their whole life. It's going to be a big problem -- it already is.<br>  <br>  But if you go publically put something on Facebook, or Myspace, or a website that's clearly identifiable as you and you yourself are choosing to present it that way, deal with the consequences. It's really not that different from publically publishing a mini-book on yourself that's out there and then being surprised when someone actually reads it and holds you accountable for it. And too many people are being careless, reckless, irreponsible, etc. about what they present to the world.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	I think that if you want to plaster your personal life all over the web, employers etc. should be able to use that info to determine what kind of person you really are and make their decision to hire you and pay you.<br>  BTW it's not just your generation. Anyone has access to these sites.<br>  And employers have been running background checks and calling references on people for years.<br>  People's personal lives DO affect their work lives, no matter what people think.<br>  O'bama's indiscretion happened over 20 yrs ago.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	Yes, a person has every right to get drunk on the weekends if they want to, but if their employer finds out about it and they're in an employment-at-will situation, their employer has every right to choose to fire them because of it.  If they're employed at-will, the employer has the legal right to fire them because they wore purple socks one day. And a school with more applicants than spaces has every right to choose one candidate over another equally qualified one because of something like a picture on Facebook.  Sorry.  Your generation needs to accept the fact that that is the world we live in today and learn that if you wouldn't want a future employer, admissions officer or voter seeing a picture of you doing it, maybe that's a sign you shouldn't be doing it (or at the very least shouldn't be letting someone take your picture doing it and posting it on the internet), and that if you choose to do it anyway, that's the consequences you may face for making that choice.  Although, if you really insist on doing this kind of stuff and posting pictures of it, all you have to do on Facebook is set your privacy settings so that any casual surfer can't see everything on your page.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	the better question is, why would you be stupid enough to have pictures of yourself smoking pot on your myspace/facebook page?  if you get your application denied because of this, quite frankly you deserved it.  many ultra liberals will say that these things are not a big deal and anybody that objects is just an uptight killjoy.  ask me again when you own your own business.  presented with two applications, one who's internet search turned up nothing and another who's search found them to be a hard partying, drinker, who you gonna pick?  <br>  <br>  as for people get disciplined/fired for what's on their pages, most of the time there is more to the story than what they are letting on.  if you are dumb enough to badmouth your boss, and/or place of work on your page than you are opening the door for them to come after you.|`|N1gd7juqaa	These people who post pics of themselves all over myspace facebook whatever the F it is are MORONS!|`|xxDjV6Axaa	That type of exposure is voluntary.  If you put it out there for everyone to see, then you face the risks involved too.  There are consequences for your actions.  If you keep your personal life discreet, then nobody knows, right?  So why tell everyone?  That is the issue.  Why does your generation feel the need to expose their every thought and action?|`|brvOa9QYaa	No they shouldnt be able to use these. <br>  its blocked at most places though to prevent people from looking on them which can be annoying but can decrease temptation to go on different sites.

It seemed to me like every journalist and reporter in the country was a republican.<br>  <br>  But after some serious thought, I realized that the journalists weren't evil republicans. No. I realized that journalists pick up on the mood of the nation and then follow that in their stories. Back then most people needed something to believe in following 9/11. The media tried to give us that in Bush. <br>  <br>  There is no question that the media sways their opinions to suit the needs of the American public. I just think it would be unfair to say that they lean conservative or liberal. They just lean whichever way is popular at the time. <br>  <br>  Funny, it seems that now the vast majority of the public need something to believe in following the disaster that was George W. Bush. So the media is giving us that in Obama. That doesn't make the media liberal, it just makes the media intelligent.|`|AA11148986	First off, Obama is not interested in the Fairness Doctrine.<br>  <br>  Second, IF he were to do that, it would give conservatives and liberals a 50% share of the market.

I could personally explain that to you.. kinda doubt that you are intested in hearing something that goes against your prejudices. <br>  Others were lied to, as related to the terms of the loans.

But there is a huge upside to home ownership - not just for the homeowner but the community.<br>  <br>  Be that as it may why is it that people who were encouraged to and sought out the American dream at fault here?<br>  <br>  When I was young and had little income and little financial experience I tried to buy of all things, a mobile home.  I could not get a loan because I did not qualify.  I was a poor risk.  I was disappointed but you can bet that if the financial professionals had granted me that loan I would have taken it, and just as suredly I would have lost it when I could not pay all my bills.<br>  <br>  So where were the paid professionals who had the fiduciary responsibility to make good loans?  The Realtors, appraisers, inspectors, loan officers, underwriters and closing agents were in fee heaven and saw no need to actually do their jobs lest the collect fewer fees.  And somehow this is the buyer's fault?<br>  <br>  And for those that think this is all because fannie and freddie were forced to make bad loans to poor people - bunk.  While it is true that rules were changed (12 years ago) to make it possible for more people to buy a home - no rule forced anyone to make bad loans.  Tens of thousands of families are happy and safe in their own homes because of it.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	Unfortunately, the government got into the business of pushing dreams onto the people of America.  The banks, driven by profit, went along with allowing the requirements to be lower than what now looks to have been sensible.  <br>  <br>  Finanacing methods that made sense for certain types of investors were then exercised with buyers that did not have the income and capital necessary to service the loan.  Unfortunately, those dreams gave way to reality and now have lead to nightmares as people can actually see the damage that was done in letting sub-prime, stated-income loans be used too aggressively in an over-heated market.<br>  <br>  Lots of fun on the way up, but it has been a long fall down.<br>  <br>  Where were the people saying, "I know that you have a job and can afford the payment for the $150,000 to $200,000 loan today, but what happens if something changes in the next 2 years?  Will you still be able to pay for the loan if 1 or 2 possibilities occur that would influence your loan negatively?"  <br>  <br>  Take the rent-to-own market.  Even during the good years of 2003-2007, people that were in the rent-to-own market were indicators of how many people with less than good credit react.  In effect, 90% of the rent-to-own crowd are really simply renters dreaming about owning a home. Why, because almost everyone of them could have actually bought the house after the first year but only about 10 to 20% were actually in a better position to do so after the first year.  So, when many of these were able to come into the market based on the lower requirements, many weren't prepared. <br>  <br>  I don't mean to shoot down every person that commits to a rent-to-own situation.  Esactly the opposite.  If you did use a rent-to-own situation correctly, you basically used a non-typical product that met your housing needs until you were positioned to complete the purchase.  Just understand that the person is the exception to what normally happens in those situations.
3caq6SFxaa	40% is not a take over as they would not be the majority share holder (50% plus one share) but would give them a huge amount of say and control and they would probably be the largest share holder.  The article says the company hopes to hold it to 25% but again that would make them a major player and probably the largest share holder.  The consequences is really simple-since they company would have to issue more stock it would dilute the value of the stock already out there; this hurts the stock market, individual investors and the numerous investment companies and groups that have stock currently-that is your retirement fund people.  If it is none voting stock the psychological side of the control will be there, and how long would it remain non-voting be asked, and the dilution of stock value is still there.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Your premise is premature.

TPB7NjvIaa	I agree that it should not be a political issue. It interferes with issues at hand that something can be done about. This one has dragged on for years and will for years to come. It has become political suicide to have an opinion on the matter. I do not care what a candidates thoughts on abortion are. I am interested in his views on economics and things directly important to the country as a whole. This is an issue that effects a few, not the majority. If you think about it, the only time it becomes an issue is during an election year. Other than that , you hear a few squawks here and there.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Your description shows why it is a political issue.  Because people find gruesom ways to do it when it is illegal.  If they make it illegal there is punishment for it.   I really dont care what happens with abortion because my individual vote wont matter when it comes time anyway.

But it wasn't,it was simply forced in by the Courts,and then reinforced by decades of Propaganda to support it.<br>  <br>  I think it's sort of naive to expect people to simply accept their Country's part in the biggest Genocide in Human History,without at least speaking out against it.And it enters Politics,since they are the only ones with the power to either stop it,or at least create some sane set of rules that protects women who really need it,but does not allow for an all out Wholesale Slaughter for the sake of convenience.<br>  <br>  AD|`|Ur9VuUfWaa	The answer is very simple and it is the same reason we fought the civil war.  It is about federalism and the state's rights to choose their own laws regarding certain issues.  Slavery, Abortion,  Gay Rights.  It is all the same.  They become political issues when the states began making their own rules regarding each and eventually dragged the federal government and the supreme court into the argument and trying to force them into making a universal nationwide federal judgment on the issue.|`|Kp5PBuO0aa	Because law is politics.

Wade took away the states' right to determine abortion laws. Abortion advocates try to scare people into thinking that overturning Roe v. Wade would lead to wholesale banning of abortion. That simply is a lie... Abortion will always be legal, but many states would like to see the criteria for abortion more narrowly defined to rule out "convenience abortions" and the like. But again, the politics of it is that it was taken out of the states' hands to decide. <br>  <br>  That is anti-Constitutional.|`|8zelZj3Aaa	It's really a moral issue. It's a political issue only because it had to be made legal or illegal and it's the politicos who make the laws. Aside from those situations where incest, rape or the welfare of the mother are additional factors, it's a bad law. Since 1973, Roe v Wade, some 84 million Americans have been killed by abortion. And aside from the killing aspect, is it any wonder that we are all worried about the social security system going broke, among other things. There will be no next generation to pay for it, the next generation is being killed off. Another reason why our politicians say it's ok for these millions of illegal aliens to remain in country, to help pay for social security, and on and on it goes. So you can see how one thing can lead to another which can lead to another and so on. I know secular America does not like facing moral issues, but maybe it's time to heed the warnings..|`|BLMh0dG6aa	I applaud your question, if you want an answer I think you'll find this is as good as any:<br>  <br>  Prior to R vs. W many rich women/girls, and many girlfriends/mistresses of rich boys/men has safe abortions.<br>  <br>  Women who had a child and didn't marry the father could be institutionalized for life.<br>  <br>  This both kept the poor, poor; and was an attack on woman's lib. not altogether dissimilar to Freud's.|`|9PAavWnyaa	It shouldn't be a political issue. <br>  The government should establish what is required for a person to practice medicine and leave the rest to the patient and the doctor.

Those who don't work hard and invest will continue to not work. Those who do will be continually punished for their sacrifice and will quit putting so much effort into making money. They will lose their money in taxes and won't have it to spend which results in higher unemployment. <br>  <br>   You are the one that is confused!!!!!  The economy is not a sport!

You are not coddled!!|`|LJwhaNIDaa	As you mentioned the economy is a team game. <br>  <br>  That means everyone who is physically and mentally capable needs to pitch in by working hard and being a productive citizen.  <br>  <br>  It is the only way for America to remain a world leader.  <br>  <br>  Giving hand outs, in any form, to the able bodied will turn America into a third world country. <br>  <br>  Giving handouts to some able bodied people, by taking from other high achievers, is demoralizing to those who work hard and save.  It will eventually destroy America, because high achievers will leave the country in droves to avoid unfair taxation. <br>  <br>  That is why America was founded, in part.  The Americans abandoned England because of taxation without representation.  So the thought of the high achievers leaving is not far fetched.  <br>  <br>  It is the free market capitalist system that has helped to make America a great nation because it has attracted the best and the brightest from all over the world. <br>  <br>  The fact that some wealthy employers may be hoarding money and paying some people very high salaries while paying the average worker too little is not a good argument for socialism or some of the socialist leaning programs suggested by Obama. <br>  <br>  A more equitable solution may be to mandate that employers treat employees more fairly by enacting fair labor laws and equal opportunity laws, and then actually actively investigate unfair labor complaints. <br>  <br>  Sometimes an employee is lazy or unqualified and they do not deserve higher pay or should be fired.  Other times, the company may be acting unfairly.  An investigation can settle this issue. <br>  <br>  Presently we have labor laws and equal opportunity laws, that are in place, but they don't have strong enough teeth, because such complaints are rarely investigated by an impartial government organization.  <br>  <br>  Many people compare America to other socialist countries like Sweden or Denmark, but this is an unrealistic comparison. <br>  <br>  Those countries are not world leaders, and the rest of the world does not look to them for aid in times of crisis or war.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	We'd never be anywhere without competition. Competition gets people motivated to better themselves. How much effort would sports teams put into the games if at the end the points were shared equally between them resulting in a tie? How much R&D effort would corporations do if their income is equalized with other companies that don't do any R&D to advance their product line?<br>  <br>  Also..<br>  <br>  If I'm not entitled to my money, how can someone else possibly be entitled to my money? <br>  <br>  <br>  Socialism is slavery, pure and simple.  You live your daily life as a slave to the government as they hand you what you need. You have to do as they say for fear of not getting your daily handout.

Those in the latter, can expect to enter the market at minimum wage.  Any chump with half a brain can tell you, the higher the education level, the more money one can expect to make and the more fun one can expect to have.  Yes, the cost of higher education is going up but there is still money out there and available to those who want to apply.<br>  <br>  I had to wait until I'd retired before I could go back to school and complete my degree.  Having done that, I still couldn't get a job -- most said that I was over qualified.  I took my last $5000 and started my own business.  I now employ 5 full time and three part time employees.  I've made it a point to live within my means.  Both of my vehicles are each 15 years old.  In another two months, I will be living debt free (save the mortgage).  How much more responsible (for my neighbor) must I be?  That he or his kids refuse to pay attention and do well in school is not on me.  That he makes minimum wage or something slightly higher, is not on me.  That he signed the bottom line on a house he should have reasonably known he could not afford, is not on me.  Must I hold his hand when he goes to the bathroom as well?<br>  <br>  I think I've got a pretty good grip on economics -- my last two degrees are in History and Sociology.

Like so<br>  many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal<br>  Democrat, and among other liberal ideals, was very much in favor of<br>  higher taxes to support more government programs, in other words<br>  redistribution of wealth.<br>  <br>  She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch<br>  Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that<br>  she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she<br>  felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to<br>  keep what he thought should be his.<br>  <br>  One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher<br>  taxes on the rich and the need for more government programs. The<br>  self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the<br>  truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how<br>  she was doing in school.<br>  <br>  Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and<br>  let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was<br>  taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which<br>  left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew.  She<br>  didn't even have time for a boyfriend, and didn't really have  many<br>  college friends because she spent all her time studying.<br>  <br>  Her father listened and then asked, 'How is your friend Audrey doing?'<br>  She replied, 'Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy<br>  classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA.<br>  She is so popular on campus; college for her is a blast.<br>  She's always invited to all the parties and lots of times she doesn't<br>  even show up for classes because she's too hung over.'<br>  <br>  Her wise father asked his daughter, 'Why don't you go to the Dean's<br>  office and ask him to deduct 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your<br>  friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA<br>  and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA.'<br>   <br>  The daughter, visibly shocked by her father's suggestion, angrily<br>  fired back, 'That's a crazy idea, how would that be fair! I've worked<br>  really hard for my grades! I've invested a lot of time, and a lot of<br>  hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree.  She<br>   played while I worked my tail off!'<br>  <br>   The father slowly smiled, winked and said gently, 'Welcome to the<br>   Republican party.'|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	No they do not, but thanks for asking.<br>  <br>  And I take issue with your assertion that I am not entitled ot my own money.  On what do you base that statement?<br>  <br>  I agree that people should not take advantage of others, but I also agree that people are entitled to what they earn.  Those who make the most pay the most taxes, and therefore they do contribute to the success of our nation in general.  Moreover, they are the ones who hire many others, pay their salaries and provide employment benefits for them.  <br>  <br>  I agree that money and power can corrupt, but that is why there are laws and rules that try to prevent that.  But don't penalize me because I have been paying my mortgage on time.  I don't have to assume responsibility for someone else's debt.  My family and I volunteer with some great organizations including VFW, Military Order of the Purple Heart, TAPS, as well as our local homeless shelter and soup kitchen.

You are NOT entitled to my money, but I will share it with who I want, how much I want, and when I want, because I certainly don't want to see people starving.  <br>  <br>  I am NOT responsible for the financial mistakes of others unless I have invested into their life or business through either stocks or a bank.  That just means everything comes full circle in the end because it would certainly be my own financial mistake to invest in an unsuccessful company or put my money in a bad bank.<br>  <br>  If I do a bad job, I EXPECT to fail.  If I don't perform at work, I EXPECT to be fired.  If I ever lost my job and were unable to find work, I would HOPE that my friends, family, and neighbors would help me until I got back on my feet.  <br>  <br>  I would never demand through law that they help me because that would turn them into slaves, rather than saints.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Like it or not, the economy has to be socialist in some way for it to work."<br>  <br>  Now thats a laugh!

But so do you.<br>  <br>  The key--to both -- is your own comment that "when some people don't do the right thing."<br>  <br>  The Republicans have adopted anattitude that what is right doesn't matter. And not just in economics. Getting what they want--by any means, fair or foul, is okay--that is their only goal and only standard.<br>  <br>  You, on the other hand, want to come up with an equally simplistic answer. A neat little ideology that says "everybody is responsible for everyone else."  That's just as wrong (and no offense intended--I mean morally wrong, *** well as being bad policy). I am NOT responsible for the actions of anyone other than myself. Neither are you--or anyoe else. But I am responsible for my actions.<br>  <br>  We do not need socialism in the US--your brand or the Republican version (and their political agenda is VERY socialist--its the variety political economists define as a government-dominated market economy).<br>  <br>  What we do need is a restoration of oversight. There is not one writer on the capitalist side in political economy--all the way back to Adam Smith and Ricardo--who has not stressed the vital necessity of state oversight  (not control) of actors in the market place to prevent abues and subversion of market processes. That is what the GOP did--remoed the oversight. Yes,we do need some "socialist" institutions. A marketsystem does not always function as well as necessary for some tasks that need to be done. So far, the best alternative that's been found is to use the state, or a public/private partnership, to do those htings.<br>  <br>  You want to whine about the rich?  Quit stereotyping. If a person is rich because they earned it--fine. If, like may of the "executives" in our financial system at present, they got their money by evasion, fast deals, or outright fraud--then those individuals should be held accountable for their actions. And no one else.<br>  <br>  That 's a lot harder than your ideology of attacking "the rich." It requires that you exercise thought and judgement and evaluate each case on it's merits, not by some ideological standard that relieves you of the need to think. It requires integrity and honesty--not the immorality of trying to resolve problems by claiming "you are not entitled to your money." Wrong. I am--I earned it. I do owe my fair share in taxes, etc. And that is all. Anything else I give--I do so from choice and to those I consider worthwhile. But what I do not owe I will not surrender on your say-so--one cent except by my own choice.|`|lWZi2p70aa	I would not call it responsible.

Sure, you can blame idiot/greedy bankers for offering stupidity in a contract, like a 0% down loan, but you can't change the fact that these people cannot afford their house and the house needs to come down in value.<br>  <br>  So middle class Americans who didn't take the 0% loans, and took smaller houses, and didn't move to California are now going to pay for those people that made bad choices. <br>  <br>  And that's not right.|`|0ICrA2Nxaa	"The economy is a team game"<br>  Yeah so the coach should also be able to kick you off the team if your not pulling your weight of if you suck at playing.|`|bZy74U06aa	Spoken like a true Marxist.|`|AA11026896	So does that mean I can stop working hard, and you'll give me some of YOUR money?

To use your comparison.  What you are saying is that if Lebron is having a fantastic night dominating the Hawks, then he should switch teams midway though in order to make the game closer that way both teams put on a good show.

HizAP9Z8aa	This might not be the exact answer you are looking for, but if we followed the U.S. Constitution, many of these things would fall under the realm of the states or the citizens.  Many of the libraries we have were originally funded by philanthropic people and organizations, including Andrew Carnagie.  <br>  <br>  The job of the government is to enforce just laws.  This means that, through modest taxes, it should support defense of national security, and a military for that purpose. (not senseless wars in Afghanistan or Iraq, or policing the world, or nation building)<br>  <br>  Police should be a much more local thing. They should be paid for by local governments (local taxes) to enforce those laws.<br>  <br>  Capitalism doesn't mean the absence of government, but it is safe to say that the U.S. has not even resembled a capitalist society for a long time.  It recognizes that local problems are best dealt with on a local level, and that the principal role of government is to establish a framework which allows for freedom of contract and national defense|`|3FtC9D40aa	Providing police enforcement, firefighters, libraries etc are a perfect function of a capitalist society. It goes to the benefit of all without targeting certain individuals and groups. It is the purpose for which we created a state and federal government to facilitate them IE Promote the general welfare. Likewise the scope of such functions would be proportionate to the needs and size of the community. <br>  <br>  It's when we government goes beyond these basic needs and starts taking tax money to fund pet projects that people have a right to get upset. States shouldn't be taking money from other states for such unneeded programs.|`|AA10469101	Would you really want Paul Blart coming to save you?

Where the objections come is when Capitalism becomes the villain and  freeloaders the victims. <br>  <br>  Remember the early American Settlement, when some settlers said they did not want to work for the settlement, they were told they did not have to but they would not share in the benefits either--that included food, water, shelter or protection. They had a choice, work or not, they chose work since they wanted the benefits the work brought.<br>  <br>  Today we have way to many in America who want the benefits without the work required. Hence the "Socialist/Marxist" references. Those who choose not to work, still get the benefits--that is not a Capitalist Society.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	The government is responsible for maintaining law and order and upholding justice as our Founders intended.|`|RBQrgByeaa	You saw the movie "Unforgiven"?|`|flV8NKruaa	Ha Ha.<br>  <br>  In a truly capitalist society, only the people who could afford the "police" would be protected.

Social programs provide for the common good.  Something that these so called conservatives don't seem to understand when they speak of our president as a Marxist.<br>  <br>  Excellent post Hot Pink!|`|AA11163314	It sounds like you do not understand the nature of Capitalism and the role of government in a capitalist society.<br>  <br>  In a Capitalist society the role of government is to establish and enforce a legal structure in such a way that everybody's rights are equally protected.<br>  <br>  I suggets that you read Adam Smiths 'Wealth Of Nations.'  A link to a summary of the book is below.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	i don't think that has ever happen in  history that's retarded capitalism is a economy principle not a government one|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	Services like that are core parts of a government operation.  Capitalism is an economic system regarding how money flows.  Funds for things like law enforcement fall outside of that realm. The same with roads/bridges and the like.  They are core infrastructure responsibilities that the government handles and are the reason we pay taxes.  The reason the government exists is to provide those core services. They've just forgotten that over time and now think they need to grab control of everything they can.<br>  <br>  Part of it is that things like law enforcement and highways/roads benefit everyone equally.  Sure you may not personally need  to make use of them, but products you order are shipped on trucks that use the roads. And thanks to laws and law enforcement that truck can safely make it to your house with your products.  Or simply shipments to your local store so you can go there and safely shop for food or whatever.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	The US Constitution provides for certain functions of society to be the responsibility of the government.  National defense is one.  A good argument can be made for environmental protection.  Libraries are debatable.  Many municipalities across America have had interesting discussions about this in recent years as libraries ask for tax increases.  Some citizens are pointing out that public libraries don't make any sense anymore.  The most frequently heard point is, "The Internet is my library nowadays."  So, it might make more sense for the remaining subset of the population who want a library to pay for it themselves, rather than impose that cost on everyone.|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Those that want law enforcement.<br>  <br>  Some people would prefer to protect themselves, and others would prefer to pay for protection.<br>  <br>  And I guarantee a private sector law enforcement company, would do as good as, or better job then, the police do now, plus they would be way more efficient then the government police, and this would allow for more cops, and no-one would be put on hold after dialing 911.|`|hnhb119Laa	You (and many people answering your question) confuse Capitalism, which is an economic system, with Libertarianism, which is a system of government.  One has nothing to do with the other.<br>  <br>  You can have a 100% Capitalist economy and still have government regulation and taxation.|`|73A0T8ltaa	If it was up to me, the government as a whole, all it's sectors would be fired, and sent their last pay checks. I dare anybody to try and rob me.<br>  But as it stands, the LOCAL law enforcement is not all bad.<br>  Some good people there.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	Blackwater or Xe if you prefer.  <br>  <br>  We don't need the CIA terrorist.  They're partially funded by drug smuggling and weapons dealing anyway.<br>  <br>  Corporations would likely purchase their own little armies.|`|VOccyg7daa	That's why we pay our taxes. Government has it's place but it's place isn't in everyone else's business.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Serious answer is I have heard no one outside of anarchist, who are not conservative/Republicans/really capitalist, say they did not agree that some government actions are necessary.  Federally the Constitution requires the government to provide for national defense (security) so yes the federal government should do that (the military) and by extension Border Patrol and the FBI, CIA and other activities necessary for the security of the nation and it is too promote general welfare which has gotten out of had by meaning provide for too many people instead of giving them an opportunity.  Phrasing a question to talk about a fringe extreme element as being every one is not conducive to an answer or to debate; I have never said that every one who believes in the government providing assistance believes that all money should be collected and evenly distributed so every one makes the same amount.  You also confuse local taxes and issues with federal taxes and issues which are two different things-I have a large say on how the local taxes paid are spent but very limited say on federal basis and do not see the Dog Park in California being something I should pay for or the high speed railroad between LA and San Francisco or Las Vegas (whichever one is chosen) and can't do anything about that.  The reason is simply put that many of those items might be great and wonderful ideas but shouldn't they be funded by the people who use them through local taxes and not by mine.  The government needs to help those people truly in need get back to their feet and be productive but all too often programs that start that way become a money pit to buy votes and voters and become a disincentive to work; why work if I don't have too or making poor choices a reason for helping the people who made them.  I come from a poor, single parent family but was raised on the belief that if I worked hard and improved myself I could be better off and I did that; I see some people that were raised with me still doing nothing and getting no where because they have decided to be drug addicts and are now "disabled" and deserve help.  The help they need is to be forced off the drugs and told start again you get nothing from us.  Government "temporary" programs all too often become entitlements and a long term drain on the workers and the economy.  If people need a hand up is one thing but too much is going to those people wanted and feeling deserving of a hand out.  You bought a house thinking you could refinance or sell and make money before the payment went up?  Tough your decision and you wouldn't want to have given me part of your profits if it had happened but want me to help you and yes the bank/lender or government or judge who gives them a break is taking from those who planned and bought wisely or saved and lived at or below their means because the money either profit or loss will have to be made up some way.  Of course the truth is you are not wanting a serious answer you will have one who thinks just as you do have an answer about heartless unfeeling money grubbing capitalist/Republicans/conservatives being uncaring about others and say I know that you are so correct.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	There are several good posts here...<br>  Zach and Angel of Death have it right...<br>  In the US, under our Constitution, the government provides the scaffold for a free society.  IOW, roads, military, etc etc etc. come out of taxation.<br>  <br>  Police would be either via local, city governments.  ALL would be equal.<br>  <br>  Benefit a few?  No, under capitalism, everyone would benefit, but those who succeed wouldn't be punished or have their property taken away (ie money) because they have more.<br>  <br>  That is the true evil of socialism.  Success is punished and failure is rewarded.  It also sounds like 'your' mind is made up and you aren't willing to hear the other side.<br>  <br>  IOW, in your world we'd be damned and the ones working to serve you.

They follow sound financial strategies."<br>  <br>  Sure they do. These are the same people that give money to the Madoffs and Stanfords of the world. Then they sit around and cry about how someone swindled money from them and how the government needs to help them out (IRS, right?). Then there's the other group of fat cats that lost billions on Wall Street, got the government to pump money into their funds and called it "necessary" help to keep the economy from failing because they are "too big to fail." Yet, the same morons call it socialism if there is any help proposed for unemployment, housing, or anything else to help those who aren't in the circle.<br>  <br>  That's why I don't feel bad at all for those rich b**ches that are selling their $1000 handbags and $800 pairs of shoes at the consignment store for pennies on the dollar. I don't feel sorry for the former executive that's having to eat at McDonald's off of the value menu instead of at the Ritz-Carlton. And, I especially don't feel sorry for the 'Joe the Plumbers' out there who now can't even afford to shop at Wal-Mart after the past eight years of bulls**t economics from the Republicans.

I do agree that at this point we need a jolt, and I think that most who watch economics would foresee nothing but a shrinking economy without the stimulus.

Soverign debt should not be compared too closely to personal debt. It is a false analogy. The big difference is that soverign nations can print money. Obviously, they can do too much of this, but, in reasonable amounts, the national debt is stimulative to the economy.

Not according to this translation:<br>  <br>  “As I’ve been told, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow (interview appeared on 30 november 07) the most important chain of newspaper of our country should give the proof, with an exceptional scoop, that the video (which in reality is an audio tape, NdR) in which appear Osama, leader of “the great and powerful movement of islamic revenge Al Quaeda” - God bless him! - and in which are formulated threats to our ex president Berlusconi, is nothing more than a fake realized inside Mediaset studios (the huge television group owned by Berlusconi) in Milan and sent to arabic television Al Jazeera.<br>  <br>  The trap was organized to create solidarity for Berlusconi, which is having lot of problem related for the tangle between RAI and Mediaset. From sources near to Palazzo Chigi, the nevralgic center of italian intelligence, we know that the video is fake because Osama admits that he was the mind behind the attacks against the twin towers, while all the democratic parties in Europe and USA know very well that the attack was organised by CIA and Mossad, whit the help of sionistic world, just to accuse arab countries and induce occident to intervein both in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is why nobody in parlament gave solidarity to Berlusconi, which is the author of the fake video" "<br>  <br>  It's apparent that Cossiga was being sarcastic about the perceived tendency of the fevered Italian Left to blame everything on Berlusconi, Americans and so-called "Zionist" bogeymen.<br>  But, Cossiga himself admits he is not a conspiracy theorist.<br>  <br>  Cossiga is a zionist himself, one of the worst.

Don't the police have anything better to do, like catch drug dealers, and child abductors, and child beaters, and wife beaters, and car thiefs? They have to go after you for a traffic violation that's 16 years old? Now I've heard everything.I would talk to a lawyer. If you can't afford one , get one appointed to you.  You shouldn't go to court without someone to represent you. They will take advantage of that.<br>  Get a public defender. This is terrible, and I do hope it all works out for you.

For a 41 year old man you sound like a whiny little kid. You did something wrong in your past.  It has to be fixed. Fix it. Get you a lawyer and follow his advice. If you don't want to do that and you keep spouting excuses then you get what you deserve. L-O-L. Or I guess you could just keep finding people who will give you a sympathetic ear.|`|lWD8f9veaa	Well, I'm wondering what state you live in.  In Washington state you can NOT have a warrent for your arrest for a traffic violation.  The only way that a warrent would have been issued is if YOU made a court date to "contest", or dispute the ticket in anyway.  If YOU make a court date you are promising to appear... failure to appear is cause for a warrant.  If that is the case, simply showing back up on the radar will stop you from jail time and you will just need to make arrangements to deal with the fine or issue resulting from the traffic ticket.  <br>  <br>  You should talk to the defense attorney that should have been provided to you at the arraignment!  they should have explained what the charges were, and what punishment you might face!!!! You have rights and you need to find out what they are.  <br>  <br>  also, as a side note the states dmv's are not connected in any way.  traffic fines etc are not linked from state to state.
HaviqgZjaa	OFGEM is the national regulatory body for gas and electricity suppliers.  I would suggest you complain to British Gas itself first though.  Utility companies frequently use agents for door to door selling, and as they do not manage these individuals directly, are often unaware of the unethical / illegal tactics they use.<br>  <br>  Utility companies can be fined huge amounts for this kind of mis-selling (npower were fined ￡1.8m at the end of last year), so I expect BG will be very keen to make it up to you, especially if you make it clear your next step will be a complaint to OFGEM...|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	Complain to british gas first if no joy complain to OFGAS  Could also inform police because seller gained access to your property by lying to you about the purpose of their visit.I suspect it wasn't a BG employee but some freelance selling extras to you always check their official ID before letting anyone in|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	You can cancel your contract and complain to Offgas|`|PwHQSAxvaa	OFGEM is the industry watchdog.

AA10118655	Paying union dues is unfair. But, the article does not say they would be paying full union dues. It would be a "fair share" fee for getting the benefits that the union negotiated for.<br>  <br>  As an alternative, what if the state started giving different benefits depending on if you are in the union or not. Maybe health insurance would be fully paid for union members (if that is what they negotiated), but only partially paid for non-union members. Union members may get an extra week of vacation each year because it was negotiated, but non-union workers would not. Union members get automatic raises each years, but non-union workers would not (only merit raises, if appropriate). Would this be fair?|`|rGWiOVDIaa	No. It's not fair. But any company that needs a union to give their employees something they need is a bad company to work for in the first place.|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	Personally I could care less about the plight of public employees!!

Most of illegal immigrants are working at sh!tty jobs for a really sh!tty pay. That benefits employers lets say in the store so you end up paying less for food in that store since employer did not pay immigrants as much.The only people who should worry about that are the Americans who  are uneducated. What makes you think that you deserve more than an immigrant.

AA11163314	What we need to do is return to program to what it was originally intended to be - an enforced retirement savings plan.

VgOCLskYaa	Every liberal who answered on this problem is an certifiable idiot. THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY FOR HEALTH CARE BELONGS TO THE FAMILY and every family should have at least someone employed so that MY family does not have to pick up the bill and if they are unemployed then they have programs to pay for health care right now.. The people who are for a socialistic type of government are either on some type of government welfare OR they don't want to pay for there own health insurance and want again my help so they do not have to foot the bill. The fact that our insurance in so high is the ambulance chasing lawyers who make malpractice insurance so high by the ridiculous medical settlement. I do not want to help people who will not help themselves|`|zI3YXvGLaa	it is socialism...just like other government provided services like the interstates or police or firemen or the military.<br>  <br>  by the way swedes are much more healthy than we in the US are.|`|J70iEDBhaa	Socialism is going worldwide.. where have you been? Look up the New World Order.. then youll understand why.|`|tXWvoYNfaa	Because its not.|`|45q1vygzaa	The UN has a list of countries by Human Development Index.  This rates them by life expectancy, literacy, education, and standard of living.  We see the following according to the list:<br>  <br>  Sweden: 7th highest<br>  The United States: 15th highest<br>  <br>  The system in Sweden is working damn good, as far as I can tell.<br>  <br>  Socialism is NOT a bad word, and not necessarily a bad thing.  Communism, not the same thing as socialism, is a bad word, only in the sense that the countries that have been communist--though none of them have really been communist in the Marxist sense--have ended up leading to the suffering, death, or indoctrination of millions and millions of people.  The suffering of people is bad, not any economic or political system. <br>  <br>   If socialism can be used in such a way to reduce suffering, then it is a good thing, simple and plain.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that socializing health care would reduce suffering, as there may be many other factors that I'm unaware of in America which would make a socialist-like system not work.  I do think, however, that a socialism-like system has worked for many other countries.  And it's at least worth a shot, to see if it could decrease human suffering.|`|Wt01utSbaa	Its affordable health care available to those who are too rich for welfare and too poor for private insurance if not offered through an employer.<br>  <br>  What makes you think that those who would need it are on welfare?<br>  <br>  What makes you think that those who don't have insurance don't work?<br>  <br>  You do know that many small business owners can't afford insurance for their employees and this would be a HUGE incentive for people to work not just for the government and large corps.<br>  <br>  You have very, very little understanding of the actual plan... please, read up on the statistics and the actual implementation of Universal Health Care.<br>  <br>  Almost every word you wrote is incorrect.|`|93CVc8ywaa	70% is only the tax rate above a certain income.<br>  You only pay about 35% for typical incomes. Then if you average the two, you are at about 45%. Of course, if you are a CEO you will average about 55%, but then you also don't have to worry about how much you pay in taxes.<br>  <br>  I am a Swedish person living in the US, and I should tell you one thing, if you have kids, you probably will realize quickly that you will get better bang for you buck in Sweden. <br>  <br>  With the average income, you pay about 45% in taxes if you have a bachelors degree. Keep in mind that you don't need to set aside money for health care, college funds, day care, and 401k.<br>  <br>  Take your federal tax rate, add your state tax, add FICO, add Social Security, add your 401k, add any kind of health insurance, add day care fees for your kids, add money you need to set aside to plan for your kids college tutition.<br>  <br>  I am willing to bet that this will add up to more than 45% of your gross income. Of course if you don't have kids, the US system is much better as you don't need to pay for the day care of your neighbor's kid or college tuition. Well better if you like to keep the money to yourself. Not better if you don't mind sharing.<br>  <br>  The first part addresses the statement that Sweden is paying the highest tax rate in the world which is close to true, but I have tried to show you that if the money is used wisely and not wasted, it can be of benefit to everybody and raise the overall living standard. For instance, Sweden is much higher up on the HDI index than many of the lower taxed countries. <br>  <br>  I would also like to make a point that US is very far from being a socialistic society. The fundamental concept of socialism is to give everybody the same opportunity, not only in health care but also in education and work opportunities. If Obama nationalizes health care which he will not, this still will not meet the definition of equal opportunities in the US as we all know, you get better doctors the more money you make in the US. While it could mean that everybody has access to doctors, I highly doubt that the person living on the streets in SF will see the same doctor as the Google Engineer.<br>  <br>  Similarly, Obama is trying to improve college tuition and make it more affordable but this does not mean US is based on a socialistic system. If you have more money, you will still go to better schools so you don't have the same opportunities here. I am not saying one is right or wrong, but US is very far from being a socialistic society.|`|50zbKv0jaa	socialism is about factors of production health care isn't an economic system<br>  <br>  universal health care is practiced by every first world democracy except the usa, time for the usa to catch up to what is normal of any country<br>  <br>  Australia has a similar rate of taxation to usa and has universal health care

No, they voted for him because he promised them a free check, free health-care, and/or because he was black.<br>  I am sorry for that, but that is what most people are, greedy, selfish, and very uneducated.<br>  Liberals don't understand that the word "Free" doesn't mean freedom, but the absense of FREEDOM, because somebody else is going to be forced to pay for what Lib government says they'll give to the "poor".<br>  <br>  <br>  You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that, my dear friend, is about the end of any nation. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.-<br>  <br>  Dr. Adrian Pierce Rogers|`|6CAsx3jaaa	does that mean that you thought mccain was wrong to argue against the tax on rich people? obama said he is going to go through the budget and cut programs that dont produce. he has also said that the number one priority now is to heal the economy that bush crippled. what rush and the rest of the idiots are calling pork is spending that has been proven to work. the tax cuts your talking about were his attempt to get the gop on board. of course they campaigned for it  and then bailed on it. they want more tax cuts because they want obama to fail more then they want the country to come back. before you deny that look at the quotes of rush in the news.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	You think he's just spending money to be spending it?

Bush, on December 17, 2007, gave one of the most succinct and clear depictions of the scope of the housing and mortgage crisis, pointing to the underreported role of some of the wealthiest players involved in the schemes. In a speech at Fredericksburg, Va., according to the official White House transcript of his remarks, President Bush said, “And the issue—the housing issue has changed. I can remember the first home I bought in Midland, Texas. I remember going down to the savings and loan and sitting down with the savings and loan officer and negotiating with the savings and loan officer. Well, this day and age you’re going to use mortgages that have been bundled, so the savings and loan doesn’t own the mortgage anymore, or the bank doesn’t loan [sic] the mortgage anymore, the local lending institute doesn’t loan [sic] the mortgage anymore: it’s owned by some international group, perhaps, or it’s been bundled into an asset. And so there’s hardly anybody to negotiate with.”<br>  Here is the key section that caught my attention in what the President said, “...mortgages have been bundled, so the savings and loan doesn’t own the mortgage anymore, or the bank doesn’t loan [sic] the mortgage anymore, the local lending institute doesn’t loan [sic] the mortgage anymore: it’s owned by some international group...”<br>  On the December 19, 2007 edition of my talk show, I said, “President Bush pointed the finger at the international bankers, did you all catch that? Excellent explanation by the President of why the hustling, pyramid scheme of the year is now coming down on us. Again, we got those mortgages so easily, not so that the bank could make money directly from us. No, we got that mortgage so easily so that the bank, the savings and loan, the lending institution, could then go to Wall Street and sell that loan and bundle it if you will.”<br>  What President Bush and I, in different ways, were describing is the little known reason why it was so easy for so many of us to qualify for the purchase of a home, over the last 5 to 10 years. Many people have been puzzled as to why a lending institution would be so willing to give a mortgage to individuals with poor credit, little income, few assets, and bad payment histories. <br>  The answer lies in following the money trail after we qualify to receive the mortgage.<br>  After we get the mortgage, the lender sells that mortgage, along with others, to a larger international, investment or commercial bank, or, to a hedge fund or private equity fund, who then takes these separate mortgages—and the expected payments on them coming from us—and combines them into a bundle, and then uses the promise of the future income stream (the monthly mortgage payments from us) as collateral to take out a large loan (from another institution) of their own to finance something like a corporate merger or the restructuring of a major business. <br>  I am aware of the amount of mortgages bundled together in one asset reaching as high as 4,000. I would not be surprised to learn of even greater amounts. This bundling process is known as securitization.<br>  How does securitization work, again?<br>  In a December 10, 2007 article in CFO magazine entitled, “Saving Banks: How the Mortgage Bailout Strains Accounting Efforts” we read, “In a securitization, a bank or other mortgage lender sells the future proceeds of a mortgage loan to a trust, or special purpose entity (SPE). The trust then pools them with other loans and issues bonds backed by the loan payments.”<br>  This article makes clear that the current effort to contain damage from the subprime mortgage meltdown is stretching accounting safeguards that were put in place after the Enron scandal. <br>  The mortgage crisis became publicly visible through the financial media in 2007 when it was learned that major banks like Bear Stearns, Bank Of America, Citibank and Morgan Stanley owned a dangerously large amount of these SPEs, some of which are also known as Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs), and that they could no longer find a market to sell them to others. The reason there were no additional buyers for the SIVs/SPEs was because those who had previously been interested in them—including many hedge funds and private equity firms—began to see that the mortgage payments that supported them were not being made on time or at all.<br>  Providing a clear and lucid description of the problem, The Los Angeles Times’ Tom Petruno wrote in the Dec. 21 edition of the newspaper:<br>  * Enron revisited. At the heart of the massive accounting scandal at Enron Corp. in 2001-02 was the energy company’s use of so-called special purpose entities—enterprises that were effectively controlled by Enron but weren’t consolidated on its balance sheet.<br>  The SPEs allowed the company’s executives to hide debt and losses and thereby distort the firm’s true earnings picture. Until it all blew up.<br>  SPE, meet SIV—the structured investment vehicle. SIVs were created by major banks including Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Inc. to hold assets off their balance sheets. The basic idea was to borrow with short-term funds to buy long-term assets, such as sub-prime mortgage-backed bonds. If all went well, the profit was the difference between the cost of short-term money and the returns earned on the long-term assets.<br>  What happened beginning in August, as the credit crunch deepened, was that lenders and investors began to balk at providing the short-term money that funded the SIVs. Bank shareholders had a rude awakening: It became clear that the banks managing the SIVs were on the hook to ride to the cash-strapped funds’ rescue—even though, technically, SIV assets weren’t the banks’ responsibility.<br>  With the SIVs, nobody is alleging the kind of blatant fraud that went on with Enron’s SPEs. But SIVs smack of the same kind of obfuscation of liability.<br>  Deception drains investor confidence, and confidence ultimately is the only thing that holds a banking system together. Why did the world’s financial geniuses need a refresher course on this point?<br>  No one who understands the debt pyramid scheme we have all been participating in or observing in the last decade’s housing market can deny that the sub-prime mortgage-SPE-SIV crisis represents the kind of deception that “drains investor confidence,” and threatens the entire banking system.<br>  The United States Treasury Department, The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have all taken unusual, unprecedented, and emergency steps to attempt to provide money and credit-liquidity to the banks holding the most SPEs/SIVs.<br>  So far, those efforts have not produced the desired results and the holders of SIVs and SPEs are turning toward foreign countries and investors—primarily in Asia and the Middle East—to provide emergency capital and liquidity. The results have been staggering:<br>  ? Citibank has received a cash infusion of $7.5 billion from Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund.<br>  ? China’s sovereign wealth fund has invested $5 billion for a piece of Morgan Stanley.<br>  ? Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund is poised to make a $4.4 billion investment in Merrill Lynch.<br>  ? Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund also has invested $9.72 billion into UBS, the large Swiss Bank.<br>  There may be more such investments made by sovereign wealth funds in struggling American and European-based international banks, on the way. China’s wealth fund has an estimated $1.2 trillion at its disposal. Abu Dhabi is sitting on $875 billion. And Russia has $300 billion ready to buy up shares in these increasingly desperate banks.<br>  In all, there are almost 40 sovereign-wealth funds, with approximately $2 trillion in assets. That amount is expected to rise to $13 trillion next decade.”<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_4275.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/...</a>|`|dJnRFpWWaa	I didn't hear what Gibbs said but I suspect it may have been connected to the remarks that CNBC's Rick Santelli made last week on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with respect to President Obama's program to avert mortgage foreclosures.<br>  <br>  Santelli has been a constant critic of any and all government bailouts, whether rational or not, to any person or entity since the beginning of the financial crisis. He's entitled to his opinion, of course, and we're free to ignore it or rebut it.<br>  <br>  The latest salvo from Santelli landed this morning. Essentially he agrees that a government encouraged/sponsored program to refinance homeowners to lower fixed rate mortgages will be helpful because it will reduce the homeowner's debt service (thereby decreasing the risk of foreclosure in addition to freeing up money for personal consumption, investment , savings, or further debt reduction, all good things for our economy) stabilize residential real estate markets, strengthen those banks holding asset-backed securities, and thus free up more money for lending purposes. But he insists the federal government can't move ahead with such a program until it conducts a forensic analysis to determine who cheated the first time around and got loans based on misrepresentations, and eliminates them from eligibility for the refinancing process.<br>  <br>  Leaving aside the fact that most if not all of the people who misrepresented their income on mortgage applications have already been washed out by foreclosure, it is essentially Santelli's position that the federal government must now do what the private sector failed to do when they turned a blind eye to rampant fraud in the mortgage market. The federal government not only has to devise the solution to the financial economy's myriad failures, but it must make the solution morally pure as well. (Please note that there is nothing preventing banks from suing individuals, realtors, mortgage originators and ratings agencies for their losses now or later after someone has refinanced his or her mortgage.)<br>  <br>  But what continues to floor me is the notion that somehow the federal government's refinancing program will pass on costs to the taxpayers that will not be recouped in the long run. It's as though the fact that the FMV of real estate having dropped due to the foreclosure crisis, I think the average drop is about 20% of FMV, isn't actually a cost to the taxpayer. So if the federal government's refinancing plan were merely to stabilize real estate values and allow them to recover lost equity over time this would be a bad thing because some ne'er do wells would also benefit?<br>  <br>  The taxpayer has already paid for the cost his or her neighbor's extra bathroom. What the federal government is trying to do is to reverse that situation. So if your neighbor can refinance to a 40 year 4% fixed rate mortgage, then you won't be paying for his or her extra bathroom because he or she can meet his or her debt service, which averts foreclosures, which removes downward pressure on real estate values, frees up money fro other purposes, which, over time, will build to increased consumer demand that will strengthen the domestic labor market, which will then increase aggregate demand for goods and services.<br>  <br>  It sounds like a plan to me. The fact that the financial economy didn't get it right doesn't mean that the federal government cannot or should not act. It means just the opposite. Helping qualified homeowners refinance their mortgage debt as soon as possible should be at the top of the federal government's to do list. In that respect Main Street can help make Wall Street return to solvency and that would be a mutually beneficial arrangement for the American economy.|`|5Mfu8lEVaa	For the most part, it doesn't.

We legally allow people to do stuff that is dangerous to their own health all the time (last I checked cigarettes and alcohol, both documented to cause severe health problems including cancer, are both legal.<br>  <br>  This is a matter of personal autonomy.  People should be allowed to do what they want with their own bodies so long as that is not affecting other peoples right to do the same.  What harm is done to you by someone who sits in their basement and smokes pot all of the time.  Or for that matter someone who stands outside and smokes a cigarette.  You simply don't think people should use pot so that is the end of the matter for you (and apparently for everyone else if you had it your way)<br>  <br>  The bigger concern of mine is the billions of tax payer dollars that are wasted everyday to attempt (and fail) at keeping pot out of the country.  There is also the billions we spend on imprisoning nonviolent drug users for their addictions as well.  This is the bigger societal concern.<br>  <br>  People who smoke pot generally respect non pot smokers more than cigarette smokers do.  For example, when was the last time you smelled someone smoking weed, or better yet, when was the last time you were in a public place and someone smoked a joint at the table next to you.  I am sure you are exposed to much more dangerous cigarette smoke than weed smoke.<br>  <br>  As to the illegality of weed, there are plenty of things that are illegal that people do each day in violations of those laws and don't feel guilty about.  When is the last time you drove 5 mph over the speed limit. Are you scum for doing that, I think not.<br>  <br>  You advocate a position that scares me (and I hope it scares most Americans.) It is the idea that just because you think something is wrong no one else should be able to do it.  There has been a lot of ink spilled on that topic and I think history is a good indicator that a CIVILIZED and DEMOCRATIC society needs to be very mindful of what they will proscribe as legal or illegal.  <br>  <br>  You should probably think your argument through a little more thoroughly.|`|ZqA7qDWAaa	Well your not only very stupid, and ignorant but misinformed.

Even worse get in a fight because of being drunk then hurt someone or kill them.<br>  Get drunk then beat your wife I guess you think this is acceptable also.<br>  Nothing worse than a slobbering drunk wobbling down the street trying to talk while on his or her way to a car to try to drive then kill someone. I guess you think this is OK also. <br>  Booze should be illegal, and people like yourself need to get educated about the subject because you are so ignorant are still thinking in the dark ages.<br>  Weed is now legal in 5 states with others in the process of doing the same so you better get use to it. <br>  People like yourself are stupid, ignorant, and a bunch of cowards that still think weed is the devils drug.<br>  Get over it, and get with the times.<br>  I will end this little bit of education by telling you this; If I had my way I would have people like yourself forced to get educated on the subject (if possible) so you don't have to sound so ignorant, and stupid when talking about it.<br>  I laugh at people like yourself when I relax with my legal marijuana. So go get yourself a drink or whatever your crutch is to get through life, and leave us law abiding weed smokers alone.

Well, its all part of the plan to undermine our society, because its capitalistic. Liberals exploit all types of people who are poor, minorities, criminals, etc- for political gain.<br>  It all melts down to- "life is unfair due to capitalism so any person who struggles or does something wrong, is not responsible for their actions because capitalism has created an unfair environment". <br>  <br>  On the surface level, liberals will always deny what I have stated but some don't understand why they goose-step to whatever groups like moveontosocialism.org or George Soros direct them to do.|`|1Ifj4DLTaa	Where in that article does it state that person's political affiliation?<br>  <br>  And are you asking liberals this question or are you asking cons to speak for liberals in this question?

3UTlASavaa	Since liberal (progressive) policies are based on the idea that man can determine his future and correctly predict the impact of actions taken through scientific determination (e.g. we know exactly how the stimulus will work and what will be the economic and social results, or at least 70% of it) they cannot permit any area to be less than deterministic.  Any question, any doubt, even about nonpolicy areas, permits doubt to creep in about the economic and social policies they support.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Science should not be a political issue. Conservatives and liberals should both just accept it. In any case, you evidently don't understand what a theory is. Gravity is just a theory, but you don't question that, do you?<br>  <br>  Gravity is NOT a law. Laws apply only to mathematics. Gravity is a theory supported by overwhelming evidence, just like evolution. It would however be possible to overturn the current theory of gravity as we know it with new evidence.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Being a liberal has nothing to do with accepting evolutionary theory.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Because we're intelligent and perceptive.  Even the Pope acknowledged that evolution is probably factual, saying that evolution can coexist with faith.|`|AA11404742	Beat's me.  I'm a conservative, and I accept the theory of evolution as a fact.  It's backed by an overwhelming amount of evidence.<br>  <br>  People who claim that since it's called a theory, it can't have been proven don't understand what the word "theory" means to a scientist.  It means a rational explanation developed from observations that accomodates all known facts and observations on the topic, and allows predictions that can test the theory.  There are other theories out there, like atomic theory, and the theory of gravity.  Do you deny that gravity exists or works?  Would you need an atomic bomb dropped in your neighborhood to demonstrate that atomic theory works?<br>  <br>  As to global warming, the evidence is piling up that man has materially affected the climate of this planet, but the theories vary as to the amount of effect, and what will happen in the future.  So that theory is a little more shaky, especially on the prediction side.  But it's pretty well established that we HAVE done something to the ecosystem.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Evolution is a very well established theory (unlike man made global warming)<br>  <br>  Gravity is a law only because Newton called it that.  In fact, the "law" of Universal Gravitation is only an approximation and breaks down when the distances get small and the masses get large.  It also seems to break down when the gravitational field becomes very weak.  The most accepted theory of gravitation currently is the THEORY of General Relativity although it also breaks down at the extremes so it is not complete either<br>  <br>  Theory is in no way an insulting term even if you think it is.  The computer you typed your question on works because of the theory of electromagnetism. the theory of quantum mechanics, and information theory.  If theory is meaningless guessing then throw it away as unreliable.<br>  <br>  I am about as far as you can get on here from a liberal but I respect science and trust evidence.  Nothing in biology or paleontology makes sense without the theory of evolution.  I will grant some possiblity for intelligent design because we are intelligently designing creatures ourselves today but possibility is very different than proof and, anyway, such design only takes place within evolution not despite it.  The theory of evolution is well established and the burden of proof rests on those who wish to claim it is false.<br>  <br>  Science is neither conservative nor liberal.  It is just a tool for understanding the world.  In fact, science goes bad when politics interferes as has happened to the theory of man made global warming|`|AA12104896	Oh joy, another scientifically illiterate person.<br>  <br>  The germ theory of disease (The theory that germs cause many diseases) is "just" a theory too. I guess that means it isn't true, right?|`|g2R7e2eVaa	I havent seen one valid argument to your statement. Only bashing of your belief. <br>  <br>  The theory of evolution is just that, a theory. Nothing more, nothing less. however dumb azzes have adopted it as fact for no apparent reason other than their hate for religion. <br>  <br>  Global Warming or Man Made Climate change, whatever the hell they call it now is just as stupid.<br>  <br>  Liberals, SHOW ME YOUR FACTS!!!!!<br>  <br>  I didnt think so because you liberal freaks have none!|`|k6hicodfaa	The majority of science is theoretical.  There are very few laws--like gravity.  It's the way science works.<br>  <br>  The science behind computers and the internet remains theory.  Looks like you're still in cyber space.|`|6AZpu3p0aa	Because the THEORY of Evolution is a lot more believable than the THEORY of Creation.|`|4IVWMgp7aa	For the same reason conservatives think Christian mythology is fact.   They'll both support anything that backs up their ill-conceived positions.|`|todJGCP8aa	Evolution is an OBSERVABLE theory...creationism is not.|`|lBT7Tel2aa	Because no significant evidence to refute it has been presented.<br>  <br>  Evolution (much like global warming) has been studied, criticized, and examined for a long time. In that time, no non-religious evidence (ie, no real scientific evidence) has been brought forward to prove it wrong.<br>  <br>  I take offense to your spelling out of "theory". It implies that we liberals are idiots. The only reason evolution hasn't become scientific fact is that we have no viable way of testing it using the scientific process. But the result of all of Darwin's studies (nearly a decade of research) cannot be a coincidence.|`|yneFUoLIaa	It is completely wrong to take a theory such as evolution and say that it is a Scientific fact <br>  <br>  A theory is still a theory as long as you just have supporting results to it that go fine with the hypothesis of the theory <br>  <br>  In case of evolution there are many results that support it like the changing in the germs to fight antibodies but still that does not make it a fact because in fact we did not see evolution happen and therefore we cannot say that it is a fact we can only say that it is probably right but still not a fact and maybe it changes in the fufture.<br>  Another example is the theory of alternativity scientests found many results that confirms the hypothesis but they never consider it a fact because maybe in the fufture it change|`|r4cThgwdaa	You obviously are having problems with the definition of theory when it comes to scientific terms.<br>  <br>  Nothing in science is considered complete and utter fact. Scientists are always and actively trying to disprove their theories not prove them.<br>  <br>  Evolution so far has never been disproved. <br>  <br>  Global warming isn't identified as a scientific theory.<br>  <br>  To compare evolution and global warming just shows your intelligence.|`|emx3HJSIaa	well i'm gonna say, just cuz they are liberal doesn't mean the believe it, though it is a notable trend that the majority of liberals do.<br>  <br>  and to the people who said "scientific fact"<br>  <br>  according to the rules of science law, it isn't a law until you prove it beyond a doubt. meaning extensive evidence AND experimentation.<br>  most the supposed evidence has been busted. because they were skeletons of diseased humans ( that caused them to look that way), chicken bones, and mere fragments (for example a 1/8 a jaw bone) that they drew up an entire creature to match. its a bunch of bull.<br>  and you can't recreate it in experiment it would take too long.<br>  <br>  and global warming... experimentation requires data collection. we have have monitored the ozone for lets round it up to 40 years. and if you want to go with saying the earth is atleast 70million years old.<br>  you have 40/70,000,000=~ 5.714 * 10^-5 percent of data.<br>  if you had 60% of data collected it would be a stretch.<br>  and they changed their theory so much cuz the earth was heating it was cooling, wait no it looks like some areas just exhibit different weather patterns (OMG rain monday and friday instead of tuesday and saturday)<br>  really the ice caps are temperature regulators, they are supposed to melt and freeze over time. just look at mars, it has the same setup.<br>  <br>  and honestly, humans contribute so little compared to nature in greenhouse gasses, we are nothing but one gnat in a swarm.|`|TrOEFKikaa	science proposes that no fact is a 'fact ' in the religious irrefutable sense, evolution is the most well-supported theory so it is used as a kind of benchmark against which others are measured. No scientific theory is presented as absolute truth, that's the point, however well I can support my theory with evidence I am always prepared to be proved wrong, I welcome it in fact because that is how knowledge progresses. Your use of the phrase 'liberals' to mean anyone who is not religious and 'factual science' (WTF) betray your ideologically motivated attempt at narrow minded rhetoric and your ignorance of the very underpinnings of scientific reasoning.|`|b152183a660c2dbd3a470965bcb67686aa	You have to have a basic understanding of science and scientific history to understand that.<br>  <br>  Gravity was once thought to be a theory, it accumulated mountains of supporting evidence (like evolution) and now is law.<br>  <br>  EDIT; Your reading comprehension is lacking.  I said gravity IS law and evolution IS accumulating mountains of evidence.  See the difference?  Good luck|`|AA10126668	I am a Liberal and I do not think that Theory of Evolution  is actually proven fact. But it does sound more logical to me than the belief of Creation.

Is it better to hire a good salesperson when sales are slowing or to cut workforce benefits until the slump ends?"<br>  <br>  6) Oh yeah, taxes would be lower -- because if you don't have a welfare state you have to fund, government cannot justify raising taxes--expecially if they institute the Fair Tax : HR.25.

That's 0.5% and most of those guys are Infantry, other combat arms, engineers, truck drivers, or MPs.  If you're not in one of those MOS's your chances of dying go from "lowish" to nearly nothing.|`|LETPAa6Oaa	like blevins311 said, it depends on your job and where your at.<br>  <br>  If you sit behind a computer all day, chances are a suicide bomber isn't going to rush in your tent in a green zone.<br>  <br>  But if your infantry or any other job that involves combat and in a red zone then I'd say chances are low to moderate.

3MM64geHaa	It is down right ludicrous!!! People run up debt and a judge can decide how much they are going to pay.  This asinine policy is going to  create a bigger credit crunch and those of us who pay our bills are going to have to pay more in order to make up for those who don't.  O is a nut and I so wish congress would wake up and take notice of how dangerous their policies are!!!|`|AA11163314	I expect that we are going to see interest rates for mortgages soar in the future.<br>  <br>  Somebody is going to have to pay for these gifts to people who were irresponsible enought that the signed a mortgage agreement that they did not understand.  And the only place for this money to come from is the people were were responsible.|`|X1yZOMYHaa	Why do you think businesses and corporations should be entitled to restructuring of debt under bankruptcy but not individuals? Why should people who own 3 houses be able to have their debts written down under bankruptcy and not people who own 1?<br>  <br>  I don't like irresponsible behavior being rewarded either. The reason bankruptcy protection exists is because it's better for the stability of the economy than the alternative.<br>  <br>  I just don't understand why you'd think it's fine for a Wall Street bank, or an auto company, or a millionaire who goes bottom up, but not for an average citizen.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	Considering that I just recently had to PAY to get my mortgage terms changed and that was even with the same mortgage lender.<br>  <br>  It's called refinancing and forcing free refinancing for people who are irresponsible is not a good idea.  If they couldn't pay it before, how likely is it they'll pay after this new plan?  Sure they will have more money, but most likely they'll just find a new way to be irresponsible with it.<br>  <br>  Especially when you consider that a drop in house value changes nothing for your mortgage.  You just keep paying the same amount and eventually the home value will go up. It's not a big deal unless you lose your job or are trying to sell the house.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	It'll be the only time a judge can change a contract.  Never before has this been done before.

In chapter 7 (liquidation) bankruptcies, you liquidate the debtors belongings (with some exceptions) and you pay off the creditors as much as you can.  If there's not enough money, tough.  In chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcies, you renegotiate the details of the loans so the debtor can pay the loans off.  The terms of the loans are altered by the court.  This is more of the same.|`|v6lkMHLdaa	This discussion is showing us people who side with big businesses or people who side with regular and no money citizens.

PaLJ4pU8aa	Liberals extol the virtues of the "little guy" only until they actually come into contact with such a person, at which point they step on him as if he is a bug.  A good example would be Hillary stiffing the waitress in upstate New York when she was running for the Senate.  Another good case was the treatment of Joe the Plumber after he had the temerity to ask the messiah a question.  Accordingly, liberals might like a theoretical Sarah Palin, but since she actually exists, they hate her.|`|2a7b3faf6505448786d487a1efedc8aaaa	They only love underdogs when they are the underdog. They cry about letting the minority voice be heard until they are the majority voice. Then it's, "Too bad. We won. Get over it. We're going to do whatever we want regardless of the consequences."<br>  <br>  Since the liberals are the ones that came up with "by any means necessary," I say it's time the conservatives started playing by the same rules.

3WYcPsm4aa	Honey, how many times are you going to ask this same question????<br>  <br>  Same thing I told you 4 days ago:<br>  Admission to any of the military academies is based upon the HIGHEST standards. Excellent GPA, involvement in school, leadership, volunteer, community, sports. Excellent heath. Recommendations from teachers, principals, and also either a Senator or Congressman. Each Senator and Congressmen is allotted a certain number of recommendations per year. Even if you are the best of the best... you still may not make the cut.<br>  <br>  Cost to you, if you are accepted: $0<br>  Although, you will be commissioned into the Army and required to serve a minimum term. (5 years active, 3 reserve)<br>  You WILL live in the dorms on base, that is not an option. And there are no satellite campuses.<br>  <br>  PS: You need to do a better job searching for info if you want in.... the answers to most of your questions are on the website!|`|IdtzdpqGaa	Have you tried going to their website, and then contacting them to get your answers,|`|EOZsYlZkaa	I had no problem finding this information on the USMA at West Point webvsite. For starters:<br>  <br>  The current enrollment is around 4,000 (the exact number can be found on the "home" page.<br>  <br>  The student/faculty ratio is approximately 1/14 to 1/18 (1 professor per 14 to 18 students)<br>  <br>  The admissions requirements can also be found at the site<br>  <br>  Undergraduate expenses are not applicable, since the army pays all tuition/fees etc. plus gives each cadet an allowance of around $6,000.<br>  <br>  Go to their website for the programs offered: West Point graduates receive a Bachelor of Science degree upon completing their programs<br>  <br>  The athletics, club extracurricular activities are among the finest offered in the US (see the web page below)<br>  <br>  There are no differences between in/out costs, as, once again, the army funds the entire 4 years.<br>  <br>  No students live off campus.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	There is no option to live off campus.  The cost of that education is around $100k/year, but you're post-grad military obligation brings it down substantially.

If so, you may want to look into some other schools.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Every question you have asked is two buttons away from the start page listed below.

(Heck, they even pay you while you are there.)  All the students live on campus.   The current enrollement is about 4,000 with, I would guess about a 20-1 student faculty ratio and a 5-1 student staff ratio (ie. counting all employees).  <br>  <br>  Engineering is the biggest specialty as it was the country's first engineering school.  <br>  <br>  There are plenty of athletic and extracurricular activities but not much time to enjoy them due to the rigorous academic work load.<br>  <br>  The academic standards are very high.  I would guess about 1400 on the SATs and a 3.75 GPA.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you contact West Point for more information or look it up in Barron's College Guide (if they still publish it) for more info.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

In my state, a 15-year-old can legally have sex with someone as old as 19; our law says that at 14 or 15 it's only statutory rape if the older partner is four or more years older.  Many states have such "Romeo and Juliet" provisions in their laws so that it's not illegal for two teenagers to have sex with each other.|`|AA10118655	It is sexual activities with someone below the age of consent. That age varies from state to state, and country to country, so you will have to check the laws for where you live.<br>  <br>  The idea is that you have to be certain age before you can legally consent to having sex. If you are below this age, you cannot legally give consent, and sex without consent is illegal.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Answer number 1 is correct.Even if you are 16 and the girl is 15 you can actually be charged with it. I find this is completly unjust when the people are the same age pretty well and they are both willing participants. But even that girls parents can charge you if they find out. I think its a slap in the face though for someone to be charged when both are involved because its not that one person is at fault. I have two daughters under the age of 10, when the time comes that they decide to engage in suxual activity I will be upset. Especially if it happens under the age of 16! But would I charge a boy for doing something that my Daughter volentarily decided to do? no. Our laws need to be changed. In the meantime, just to be safe, make sure you know what your laws are and try not to break them. you could land yourself in a lot of trouble.|`|TrOEFKikaa	American law that states if someone over age of consent has sex with someone uinder age of consent that is staturory rape (I think).. serious issue, check with others first.<br>  edit:  irrespective of consent.

For example if a 12 year old engaged willingly with a 20 year old. <br>  <br>  The twenty year old could face lots of charges including statutory rape as a person of such young age can not give consent. Where as an older person such as 15 is still under the age of consent but in this case the charge would be a lesser offence of sexual activity with a person under consentual age.<br>  <br>  This is considered a more serious offence than intercourse with a person under the age of consent. It can also be applied if a person has learning difficulties and therefore is not capable of consenting.|`|JT4OkvFeaa	It's whats going on with majority of teens and their older boyfriends or girlfriends.  Ha. <br>  <br>  You just don't tell.   Gotta be careful if you are the older party.<br>  <br>  The law is pretty much based upon no research and is arbitrary, from place to place.  So it depends on where you are.<br>  <br>  In some countries age of consent is 12, in other places higher.  Go figure.
iWLeHnlnaa	YES THEY DO!<br>  <br>  The claim that they cost more then they put in is totally false. Immigrants Pay More in Taxes Than They Use in Services Over Their Lifetimes: Depending on skills and level of education, each immigrant pays, on average, between $20,000 and $80,000 more in taxes than he or she consumes in public benefits. <br>  <a href="http://www.aollatinoblog.com/2008/04/14/do-immigrants-pay-their-fair-share-of-taxes-you-bet-they-do/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aollatinoblog.com/2008/04/14/...</a><br>  <br>  Illegal immigrants benefit the economy in many ways, and I've included links so you know I'm not making this up.<br>  <br>  1. They pay BILLIONS in taxes, and many don't claim taxes. Those taxes help many things like Social Security, Medicare, local schools and even road maintenance.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2008/04/10/20080410biz-TaxingImmigrants-10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.azcentral.com/business/articl...</a><br>  Illegal Immigrants pay BILLIONS in taxes every year<br>  <br>  2. Their hard work and determination helps U.S. companies and farms stay competative in today's fierce market. They work very hard and for low wages, and this help companies make record breaking profits, and that allows them to keep their prices low. U.S. farms will not operate without illegal immigrant workers, and that means more farms will shut down or move to Mexico where the workers are without immigration issues.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/04/america/export.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/04/a...</a><br>  U.S. farmers go where workers are: Mexico<br>  <br>  3.

The best option is to gradually pay down US debt first.

ABmZYbDZaa	Here is one of many good sites for info on the new GI bill.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gibill2008.org/faq.html#mil-spouse" rel="nofollow">http://www.gibill2008.org/faq.html#mil-s...</a> <br>  <br>  Here is what it says about transferring to a spouse/dependent. Chapter 33 (the new, post-9/11 GI Bill) allows the Secretary of Defense to provide currently serving troops the opportunity to transfer education benefits to a spouse or to one or more of the individuals children. The Secretary of Defense is about to issue regulations on how this program will be implemented. However here are some of the baseline requirements.<br>  <br>  To qualify for transferability a service member must: <br>  1.Qualify for the education benefits themselves <br>  2.Served at least 6 years on Active Duty or in the National Guard or Select Reserves <br>  3.Agree to commit to 4 more years of service starting Aug 2009  (total of 10 years) <br>  4.Have a spouse or dependent to transfer benefits to <br>  The ability to transfer benefits will start being available August 2009. A service member may transfer part or all of their remaining education benefits as they see fit between their family members.<br>  <br>  There are different rules on how a spouse vs. a dependent can use this new benefit. A spouse will have up to 15 years after the service member discharges from the military to use their transferred benefits, while a child will have to the age of 26 to complete their education. A spouse can begin using the benefit immediately, while a dependent must wait till the service member has completed ten years of service and the dependent has completed high school or turned 18 years old. Lastly, a spouse using the GI Bill while the service member is still on active duty will not receive the monthly living allowance and a dependent will be entitled to the full benefit.<br>  <br>  As it draws closer to August the education center on your post should have better info to give you and have the paperwork to request the transfer if you qualify at that time.|`|zGVVxuFLaa	Another good site for more information:  <a href="http://www.military.com/money-for-school/gi-bill/learn-to-use-your-gi-bill" rel="nofollow">http://www.military.com/money-for-school...</a>|`|PPKuHl9baa	The new GI BILL gives you full tuition, full books, and tutoring fees at the highest in state college also they pay you E-5 BAH with dependents at whatever area you move to. It's a pretty good deal., good luck. You can probably go to military.com to find out latest updates. The GI BILL is still rolling strong and hasn't been affected by any economic situations as of yet. It's still 90% of the military pays for 10% of them to go to school. That's because 90% of the people usually never enroll after separating. Better get in there soon because Obama would cut the GI BILL in a second if it meant he could fund a pet project with the money. He hates the military and refuses to even pay any base a visit.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	The new bill hasn't taken effect yet.  Certain criteria must be met in addition.

s7TaxmIGaa	No~ I also think the age should be raised to 25 ~ at 18, thoughts, feelings, urges and unrealistic values of  all kinds  merge together or hap hazardly ,  and judgements are not defined or thought out.. they have not yet matured  to be able to sort out the good, the bad ,and the ugly ..  alcohol  makes this much worse   resulting in accidents, destruction, bad judgements and decision making , ruining  and/or ending many lives ,forever....I actually think all achohol should be limited for everyone, it causes so much misery . but,it can be a good thing if used properly and wisely|`|AA11481224	lord no i think it should be raised to at least 25|`|AA11206283	God no. Too many dead drunken driving teens and people who can't always avoid them|`|AA10783710	I have a more encompassing view than just lowering the drinking age.  Let me explain.<br>  <br>  I am a 48 year-old Chicagoan who recently moved to the Czech Republic.  This really opened my eyes.  I realize now so many of the problems in the U.S. are of our own making, and mainly it is that we try to "protect" everyone so much that we unintentionally keep them in a state of pre-adulthood, so that concepts of self-reliance and self-responsibility are grossly under-developed in the average individual.<br>  <br>  I call it the "Forbidden Fruit Paradox".  We make alcohol tempting by refusing it to young people, so of course they become obsessed about being able to drink.  I know I was!<br>  <br>  Here in the Czech Republic, kids don't obsess at all about drinking.  It's not important to them.  If they wanted a beer or something they could get it, and hence there is no pent-up desire.  There is no "coming of age" coolness factor associated with drinking.<br>  <br>  We create this glamorous allure of drugs by making them seem like part of a cool, underground culture.  But in the Czech Republic, drugs are barely a blip on the radar of "crimes".  Drug addicts?  Not even enough to rate an article in the newspaper.  Why?  Drugs were never glamorized by making them so strictly illegal.<br>  <br>  Teenage sex?  Here, parents are normally very at ease with their children having sexual relations.  A 19 year old can date a 16 year old without even an eyebrow being raised.  So guess what the rate of teen pregnancy is here?  Once again, so low there isn't even some campaign to lower it.  People here have developed a sense of responsibility because they know they can drink, they know they can get drugs, they know they can have sex at will, and hence they look to themselves to be prudent in these areas.<br>  <br>  In stark contrast, the average American teen is absolutely obsessed with sex, or drugs or alcohol.  For them, it's an alluring goal that will make them feel good.<br>  <br>  One last thing about the culture of fear we've promoted in the U.S.  When I was young, I'd leave the house on a summer day often around 8am and come home at 6:30pm for dinner.  The whole day was spent playing around the neighborhood.<br>  <br>  Nowadays parents are scared to even let their kids play right outside their own homes!<br>  <br>  This culture of fear is completely absent here in Europe.  I was shocked when high school age kids tell me that they frequently just hop on a train with friends and visit a neighboring country.  When you are 12-18 your school class takes trips all over Europe.  Parents don't stress about it, make up rules for their "precious little darling", and have no fear that some harm will come to their children.<br>  <br>  But in the U.S. we're living on fear.  Nothing is considered safe.  Hence, we erect wall after wall of rules and prohibitions, all of which stunt the emotional development of kids who aren't exposed to the real world.<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  EDIT:  I'm amused as I read the responses that just reinforce my point.  Namely, the people who lament how misuse of alcohol or something else can devastate lives, or the lady below who actually thinks we should RAISE the age to 25.<br>  <br>  Consider my argument:  we're CAUSING the problem, people!  In other countries, they have rates of alcohol abuse, drug use, and teen pregnancy at a tiny fraction what it is in the U.S.  And the reason is that, when you grow up without people holding your hand everyday, you develop a self confidence and the ability to act prudently.  As it is, American teens just go crazy at every opportunity.  In stark contrast, their European counterparts couldn't give a hoot about getting a hold of some alcohol, and neither do they obsess about the other "forbidden fruits" we've created.<br>  <br>  Just keep this in mind:  we are exacerbating the problem by our actions, not alleviating it !!!|`|xxDjV6Axaa	No, esp not with this generation.  I doubt if we have ever had a generation with so much crime commited by under 21 year olds.  If anything, we need to raise it.|`|5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	No it would be not good to combine alcohol with immature tailgating parties which are reckless operation of a motor vehicle.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	No, bad idea. People are too irresponsible these days.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	I think I read a story on this, and supposedly a lot of College Professor are behind this. Their reasoning is that most of the kids would get it out of their system before coming to college.<br>  <br>  I can see this a good thing and a bad thing, but I think overall it still won't help the situation with teens binge drinking at party's and teens drinking and driving.<br>  <br>  If you're an alcoholic, no matter how old you are you are going to find away to get some. I say lower it, all the 18 year olds I know now are drinking already, some more than others but eh there is always going to be one of those in the bunch.<br>  <br>  I'm 25 and have 2 younger brothers.|`|AA11737190	I don't think the problem is when you drink as much as how you drink. Enjoying a glass of wine with dinner is completely different from chugging beer bongs to see how drunk you can get. I think young people can learn to handle alcohol responsibly, but our culture does not encourage that.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	they tried this in the 70s and it was a disaster.  drunk driving deaths doubled in some states.  that is why it's 21 now.|`|0AsL26sSaa	No, people are getting dumber more and more with every generation. 21 year-olds are not responsible at all.|`|sg2UdK5haa	Only if the driving age is raised to 20.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	Not at all.  I don't think 21 is old enough.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	no|`|gYfvCkRPaa	No.<br>  <br>  I am an ex-cop and I saw a lot of lives devastated by people 18-21 drinking and then driving into innocent victims. It's tragic to see a 19 year old crash into a family and kill a mother and daughter. He has to live with that on his conscious the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  Because the age is now 21, many underage drinkers stay 'underground' and don't risk driving and getting caught. I am realistic enough to know they do drink, but keeping them off the road is essential for keeping more of them alive.|`|0TX93IsYaa	the fact is, if you like drinking, whether your 25, 21, 18 or 16, your going to drink regardless of what the law states. i have a theory that teens drink illegally cuz its a kind of a way to rebel and say screw you to the system, its that adrenaline rush(partly). because once you turn 21, if your a drinker, the only difference is you get to sit in a bar stool. whoop de doo.|`|SXZfntmUaa	im a teenager my self living in UK and some people drink like 3 times a week, just because the age is 18.<br>  lowering the age down will cause more problems as your allowed to go in pubs and clubs.<br>  im totally againsts it.|`|PPKuHl9baa	No, once you're a little older I think you understand it more. 18 year olds can sneak around and get drunk pretty easily anyways. There would be a lot of bad things that came with that.|`|oDqRL2gQaa	No. 18 year old are more irresponsible than 21 year olds.|`|xuSFQksdaa	yeah cus when it's so restricted people use fake id's <br>  and simply do it underage<br>  get it from others<br>  sneak in to places<br>  <br>  when u cant beat em join em<br>  LOWER it.|`|tKfOcgDlaa	no, I think it should be 21 or maybe even over.

xxDjV6Axaa	You need to put this in the court's hands instead of trying to work it out.  Usually you need the same qualities to work joint custody that you needed to make your marriage work.  Since you probably divorced because you don't see eye to eye, it isn't going to suddenly change.<br>  <br>  And your ex should be paying child support for this child.  You shouldn't be paying 100%.  Get that going through the child support enforcement agency.  You just fill out some forms, not a big deal.<br>  <br>  Then go to court and get a visitation schedule set up.

WiNq5wyQaa	The highest Human Development in Chile exist thanks to the coalition of Socialist Democrats in Government after 1990. Before that and thanks to the CIA, Mr. Nixon and some American Companies they had a terrible Dictatorship ruling for the rich people for 17 years. But also because institutions works there. Corruption is very low and most of the politicians are " honest". Chilean health system is a lot better than the one in the USA.|`|gAGnRHIUaa	It is because they have had a reasonably stable government for years. Despite being under a dictatorship for years, Pinochet, the transition to civilian government has been smooth. They have a stable economy and provide a good heal;th service and pension scheme for all citizens. In fact many years ago , Frank Field, a British politician, actually recommended the Chilean model to be adapted here in the UK. It is a state pension that people contribute to but it goes into an individual account and does not pay for to-days pensioners. They have never really had heavy industrialisation that lends itself to poor health, rather the economy is mainly agricultural.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	I hear it is their isolation from the rest of the continent, by the Andes Mountains. and they had a right wing Dictator for so many years he developed the Agriculture industry, Some say Chile is almost more of a European country than a South American country
86ea0f606c4289ae57db03fa34a6da0aaa	The former president Ricardo Lagos had a vision to modernise the country's infrastructure. As luck would have it, the price of copper went sky high in his final years and Chile being a large producer of copper, found itself very well off and able to pay for this vision. Another important factor is that corruption is virtually unknown in Chile.|`|ggMDAo0Kaa	It's cold|`|Q7ovix19aa	Decades back it abandoned it's crippling socialist policies and adopted more free-market capitalist ones.  It alternately had both national and international socialist policies.  Pinochet led the national socialist and Allende led the international socialist.<br>  <br>  Unlike the two North American countries,  Chile's government was sincere about free-market and didn't just pretend while hanging onto crippling regulations benefiting government control at the sacrifice of citizen's prosperity.  <br>  <br>  One of Chile's excellent practices (although quasi-socialist), I understand, was requiring citizens to invest for their own retirement.  That not only benefited citizens, but helped build a large capital base for the whole country's economic advancement.

You will still get classified as high priority.  Meaning you are higher on the list of competitors.  You would be chosen over spouses, other civilians, etc.  Apply through USAjobs.com but be careful in how you write your resume.<br>  <br>  CANS codes the resumes based on key words.  I found that out the hard way.  I wanted a job maintaining health records databases and I had done that before.  I wasn't selected so I pulled my sheet.  I was coded as an accounting clerk!  I had worked as a loan officer at a bank at one time and that is how they coded that job.<br>  <br>  The key words have to match the description you are applying for.  Look at the elements of the job and change your resume to have the same key words that the job has.<br>  <br>  Then you wait to be called for an interview.  Apply to several at one time so you have a better chance.  And then also take anything that you can get.  You can always make a lateral move or even get promoted after you have been on your job for at least 6 months.  Some require a year though.

To send money to an inmate, it must be in a money order made out to the inmate. Address the envelope to the inmate at his facility, enclose the money order and send it via US Mail. Be sure to include his/her inmate OPUS number. All mail is opened before the inmate gets it. Your money order will be deposited in his account. Complete rules about inmates can be found at <a href="http://www.doc.state.nc.us" rel="nofollow">http://www.doc.state.nc.us</a>  You can even do an inmate search.|`|W4GXLw0naa	<a href="http://realinall.cname.at" rel="nofollow">http://realinall.cname.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

6OLiuM9Gaa	Is this a good time to join the military?<br>  <br>  Some of the posted answers are... interesting.<br>  <br>  President Obama campaigned on a platform to cut military spending by 25%. Recently he sent a dictum to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to cut 55 million. He also said he'd eliminate "unnecessary" military spending, and cut funding on research and development.<br>  <br>  Now, you can put any spin on that you wish, but it means fewer military jobs. At one time in his campaign (when I supported him) he talked about reinstating the Draft... but that's apparently gone. So, his intent is to further erode the number and quality of our service personnel, train and equip them poorly, and then make them unnecessary by somehow declaring global harmony.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, President Obama is a politician. He's absolutely nothing else. He's the figurehead of the political machine. The Democratic Party's agenda has been to socialize our system. The poor, ignorant, American people are incapable of taking care of themselves -- or, more likely, they're just too blasted lazy and spoiled to do so -- and they want the federal government to take care of them... and the Democratic Party wants to do that... at a ridiculously high overhead. To fund that dream, they -- every time they're in office -- cut more out of the military.<br>  <br>  I have, from the election, said that we need to give President Obama a chance. Apparently he has the support of the majority of the people... hopefully they're not all stupid. I'm a veteran. I served under several administrations. Regardless of what I thought of the individual in office, to me he was "SIR!" and at the top of my food chain. However, now that I'm retired and have more education than any President in history... and, except for Eisenhower, a longer military record than any of them, my concern is for the soldiers, past, present and future.<br>  <br>  The first thing President Obama did was to opt for political/social gathering rather than honor Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. That's a political move, not a pro military move... and it shows a total lack of respect for the military.<br>  <br>  The second thing President Obama did was to order the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo. That was a political move to garner public support. Nobody with at least a minimal intellect would ever release potential criminals into the very society many of them would die to see destroyed... and I can't imagine anybody... even without intellect... would want to protect those individuals under the laws of that society. The politicians would have us believe that the world will look on us more favorably. They're wrong. The civilized nations will look on us as fools. The uncivilized nations will look on us as weak.. and ripe for the plucking.<br>  <br>  And, the last thing he did was to go to JCS with a demand to cut $55 million from their budget. This is purely political. (1) It allows him to start cutting the military down to nothing... apparent party intent. (2) It puts the onus on the military. When they come up short, he'll put on his innocent political face and whine, "I told YOU to cut the budget. I know nothing about the military. I counted on YOU to determine where you could best cut funds. That you cut it where you did is YOUR FAULT. Why can't YOU do your jobs?" It's called political finger-pointing at a scapegoat.<br>  <br>  One poster suggested that most of the military supports President Obama. That one is in error has a limited exposure. I chat with quite a few military personnel every day. I live in a VA Home. I work with guys coming back from the Middle East. To be sure, some of those with whom I chat, and some of the guys here at the Home think he's ok. However, those who are active who support him are in the small minority. And most of those who support him at the Home have alzhimers or are mentally incapacitated in other ways... one, for example, has brain damage... not service connected... started a fight and got hit in the head. That's not to say that all those who support President Obama are nuts or incompetent. And there are also some who don't support him here at the Home who have similar ailments. But, almost to a man, those coming back from the Middle East are really tired of incompetent civilian intervention in military affairs. One said he wouldn't vote for anybody for anything if they didn't have a record of military command. A little over the top? Maybe, but to me it seems a better criteria than voting for somebody just because he's not somebody else.<br>  <br>  One thing worries me. Veterans get paid by the government. We're of little value to the economy any more. We really don't contribute much to the security of the nation any more. Not a whole lot of us supported him, so we're not much good to him politically. And we are military. In his infinite wisdom, how soon will President Obama consider us an "unnecessary military expense"?<br>  <br>  I'd join to serve my country if it needed me. I did... and served a quarter of a century. But the way the country is treating it's veterans... well, it bothers me. It's not just the President. It's the people in general. Today's "American" doesn't care about his country. Today's "American" only cares about himself. I remember when President Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." Those are words spoken by a military hero, who happened to become President. What's more surprising -- especially in view of today's attitudes -- is that those words were spoken by a Democrat. On the cover of a recent magazine, maybe News Week -- not sure, was the caption, "We are now all socialists". We've come a long way. But, is it in the direction we want to go?<br>  <br>  If I were you, and if I were going to harbor any idea of making the military a career, I'd be hard put to join at this time. If you're joining to serve your country, you can do that as long as you can under any administration... I did. If you're only joining for the benefits, then it doesn't make any difference to me when you join.|`|AA10106002	If you're are not willing to kill people and destroy things no time is good to join the military.

While for most things he does not have DIRECT control of what we do, it's a massive relief to have an adult in charge and one who is sending us out for the right reasons instead of never even having the balls to give us a straight answer as to why our boys were coming home in bags.|`|jUdqsRfOaa	Sure why not.<br>  <br>  Barack Obama campaigned on a platform of increased defense spending.  True to his word, Obama's 2010 fiscal year budget calls for $527 billion in defense spending (not including the costs of Iraq and Afghanistan).  That is more than the U.S. allocated for defense in 2009 and equals what the Bush administration budgeted for 2010:<br>  <br>  The Obama administration has given the Pentagon a $527 billion limit, excluding war costs, for its fiscal 2010 defense budget, an official with the White House’s Office of Management and Budget said Monday.<br>  <br>  If enacted, that would be an 8 percent increase from the $487.7 billion allocated for fiscal 2009, and it would match what the Bush administration estimated last year for the Pentagon in fiscal 2010.<br>  <br>  So Obama proposes that the U.S. spend $40 billion more this year than it spent last year.|`|gYfvCkRPaa	William,<br>  <br>  I served in the military under both Carter and Clinton.<br>  As they both fumbled and bumbled about trying to figure out what they were doing, it generally didn't affect lower ranking personnel.

Closing Gitmo and letting terrorists go, doing foolish things to hamstring our troops...that could be a problem. He seems more loyal to terrorists then to Americans.|`|Fq3J2j7vaa	Obama announced that he will cut the national deficit by half by 2012 by cutting defense and increasing taxes.<br>  <br>  This should not impact the grunt on the ground but Carter and Clinton sent troops into harms way and failed to adequately provide support.

The problem is MBAs running the whole show who don't care about cars, only about short-term returns.  I'm tired of people blaming the unions.  Unions didn't design these cars.

All the Obama administration is doing is saving the taxpayers money by driving something that holds its value a little better than the vehicles produced here in America.

If that's true, that would mean the criminal statute of limitations is ten years.<br>  <br>  You are also free to contact the Oklahoma Court Clerk who sent you the letter and ask him or her to send you a copy of the applicable state statute under which they intend to prosecute you if you don't comply.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tOBUxfYvaa	I believe the statute of limitations is up and I doubt that they would try to prosecute anyway since prosecution would be costly and would not be beneficial to pursue and the check was such a small amount.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	I would look up the phone number to the Clerk of the Court and give them a call.  Don't use the phone number in the letter as it may be bogus (you never know these days).  All county offices have web sites with contact info, call and verify before sending any money.<br>  <br>  If the letter is from a collection agency then send them a letter, certified mail return receipt, asking for proof.  Do not call them, you want all contact to be in writing, and save a copy of the letter you send.  The are debt collectors out there that try to scam money out of people claiming they are collecting on some old debt.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Most likely, charges have already been filed, and the $220 is the fine. My advice is to pay it. In Oklahoma, that's a felony, and they will issue a warrant if he doesn't pay.<br>  <br>  Since charges have already been filed, the statute of limitations doesn't apply.

One of the biggest issues with government is the welfare system.  At one time people didn't have a problem working for what they needed or wanted.  Over the years the government has given more and more hand outs to more and more people and is creating an unprecedented dependency on government.  People have a feeling of entitlement these days.  They are entitled to health care, they are entitled to welfare, they are entitled to anything and everything that the other person has regardless of whether they work for it or pay for it.<br>  <br>  Another issue is taking away power from the states.

Get creative and start thinking of ways you can bring in an income.  Yes, there are programs that offer job readiness and such, but I cannot see why your local welfare office would stop you from doing that - that is preferred thing to do - I will recommend that you take advantage of any resources that welfare or unemployment  may offer you, such as resume building, job search engines etc - Learn how to be interviewed well, the do's and don'ts, etc.<br>  <br>  Most employers like to know who they are hiring, so spread the word to your friends and family that you are on the look out for work-  Employers tend to hire within, and if that is not an option, they like referrals from their employees.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Are you single?

In fact, with all the grandstanding he was doing, it's surprising that terrorists didn't set off  a dirty bomb, just on principle.  Bill Clinton was in office for less than a month when they hit one of the Towers back in '93.  By your logic, Bill Clinton kept us safe for over 7 years, until Bush phuhked it up.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that terrorists got their point across by leveling two giant structures, in the financial capital of the free world.  The FEAR of thinking another attack was coming worked a lot better, and was a lot cheaper than actually carrying out another attack.  I work in NYC, and my office overlooks Ground Zero. I see everyday the collateral cost of  terrorists actions in one day.  We are coming up on the 8 year anniversary of 9/11, and there are still no building in the pit where two humongous buildings once stood.  Another building is still being torn down floor by floor, (Deutsche Bank Building) because it was heavily damaged, but a controlled demolition could not be done.  There are NYPD and Port Authority police everywhere. There are still random bag searches on the subways.  The terrorists see this, and the state of the US and Global economies, and realize they don't need to attack anymore.  They don't seem to be into world domination (like the US Government), they just like inflicting pain, which they have done successfully.<br>  <br>  At the very least, Obama is at least trying to find out why these groups hate us.  At the end of the day, it may not be possible to reason with them, but it doesn't mean you don't try.  The policy of not negotiating with terrorists hasn't really worked out for the US either.  Either bringing troops home, or diverting them to where Bin Laden is sounds like a better deal, and makes me feel safer.  It also make me feel like those sodiers who are out there now won't by dying for nothing. Out objuective was never to Liberate Iraq, it was to find and kill Bin Laden.  The Bush administration lied to the public and told us that Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were connected, when in fact they were not.  The President lying to the American people did not make me feel safe.|`|Hi5NyLfvaa	If there is no terrorist attack, you will say it's because Obama is himself a terrorist and in league with the terrorists.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Every branch has a military police unit but may use different names. <br>  <br>  Army and Marines are MP's, Navy is Master at Arms and the Air Force has SP's.<br>  <br>  Which one would be right for you is up to your own individual preferences. Army and Marine MP's go to the same job training which is run by the Army but Marine Corps basic training is more difficult physically. I suppose that the Marine Corps MP's might be more physical all around but I don't think it's by much.<br>  <br>  As far as my opinion goes, they are both (generally speaking) highly professional and disciplined positions whether it's Army or Marines. You will get more amphibeous training in the Marine Corps while the Army will concentrated more on land combat. I personally think the Marine Dress Blues are awesome but now that Army is going to standardized Dress Blues that's cool too, however you might not want to base your career choice on who's uniform is the coolest, just putting my two cents in.<br>  <br>  Either way, in the end your training is going to be Army whether your a Marine or Army MP.|`|7idyT7Obaa	i dont think the marines have MPs i think they use the navy's version. i could be wrong though.<br>  honestly if your looking for a 'professional atmosphere' then thats definately not the military. dont get me wrong when its time to be serious we are, but those times when your not training or not outside the wire, everyone acts like a kid to a certain degree.|`|ILjHzC74aa	I don't know much about Army MP's but I have spent a LOT of time with Marine MP's and I'll tell you what I know.  First, about the only negative is the advancement.  It is very hard to advance in the Marines as an MP, their cutting scores are always very high or locked out.  MP's get to go to a lot of great schools and are always doing awesome training.  If you want a more "hardcore" lifestyle, then I believe you will want Marines.  From personal experience Marines are in a more professional atmosphere, but that's not to say they don't have their jokers as well.  The MP's I have delt with have always been a great bunch of guys (and ladies) and either way I think you are picking one of the best jobs.  Good luck!

No business in the history of the world has ever paid a penny in taxes. These taxes are a cost, like labor, that is built into the price of the goods that the company manufactures. As a result, it is the people buying those goods that pay the tax. So, while Barry is for raising taxes on business, he is in actual fact, raising the taxes on the people. It's a shell game since, I can assure you, Barry understands this simple fact and he knows that his constituents do not. <br>  <br>  So, in answer to your question, yes. Because in order to be competitive, businesses have to manufacture their products and be able to sell them at a competitive price. No one in their right mind is going to buy a loaf of bread for $5 if there is one of equal quality sitting right next to it for $3 and business knows this. <br>  <br>  The other thing is the belief among Barry's constituents that business is out to rake in the money. This is because these people, generally, have never run a business. There's a little thing called competition out there that results in profit margins for most every company out there at between 3 and 8 percent. Does this sound like they're making a killing to you? If moving to Mexico will give you a one percent advantage, you'd be crazy not to do it.|`|u23sBafTaa	Don't you love to see where the highest tax rate is !  100,000 clear up to 335,000 that seems like a big difference in income and a clear desire to destroy middle class Americans !

Seems both countries are on the road to economic destruction, but remember, China does not care about its population, if they starve/die just less mouths to feed.

8cLV2OPYaa	Modern politics is the only science that has hardly advanced at all since it's creation. Ancient Athens in about 500 B.C. is often used as the point of origin of "large scale" state democracy. Most people believe that the several forms of democracy that exist currently in the world are the "apex" of political advancement. Aside from the absurd degree of arrogance in that statement, it is also useful to point out that technology from other sciences notwithstanding, the basic concepts of democracy for instance haven't really changed a lot in over 2,500 years.<br>  <br>  This leads me to the conclusion that either politics itself really isn't a "true" science, or that we have not been very successful in researching or seeking "discovery" within the boundaries of the alleged science.<br>  <br>  In the ancient world we believed the world was flat. I think that modern politics stands as an example of a science that still believes that the world is "politically" flat, so to speak. Does anyone know of a laboratory anywhere that is exploring any "frontiers" in politics? Anybody know of any recent "breakthroughs" in political thought? Anybody ever hear any political theories that are legitimately unique and proprietary, as opposed to a re-wrapped, re-named version of a system that already exists. In fact, only Hollywood has ever dared to explore any significantly unique concepts in politics, generally for the purposes of fleshing out story lines generally relegated to the world of science-fiction, with respect to authors I may not be aware of.<br>  <br>  So your question is straight to the point, and so is your answer. Yes. Political parties are as archaic as the systems they operate within. The entire concept of modern politics itself remains a stubbornly archaic field of knowledge. Unfortunately politics seems to really be more of an art. I call it the art of saving ones butt and face at the same time. Euphemistically, you could call modern politics the art of allowing the wolves to guard the hen house. In any case, clearly we have HUGE problems with the varied global approaches to governing people. Problems that very few seem willing to investigate real solutions to, and as long as people can profit from the LACK of advancement in politics, we will continue to NOT advance in politics.|`|VjibJEijaa	In the 1970s J.J. McRoach ran for parliament as candidate for the Australian Marijuana Party.[citation needed] He had an advertising campaign funded by a well-meaning anonymous dealer. His party came fourth in the elections. In 1986 Nick Brash ran for the “Marijuana Party” for the Kiama NSW by-election against ALP heavy-weight Bob “Bobo” Harrison. Then in 1987 Nick Brash ran in the Heathcote NSW by-election with 13 other candidates including the infamous Rex “Buckets” Jackson. This campaign was partly funded by the late John Marsden, solicitor and outspoken civil libertarian. Soon after the Heathcote, the electoral laws were changed requiring all political parties to prove a membership of 500 enrolled voters, an impossible task for the Marijuana Party. The independent HEMP Legalise Marijuana party continues to run in the upper house in South Australian legislative elections, with their best result being in 1997 when they received 1.7% of the vote, beating relatively popular parties such as the SA Greens and the SA branch of the National Party of Australia.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Pathetic is the word I would choose.

G1XqmETjaa	many inner city schools are funded almost entirely by federal and state funds where as the districts that are in better neighborhoods have the same state and federal funding plus more local money and that makes a big difference in the schools budget. also parent involvement in the school and their kids personal education varies from area to area. this also makes a school more accountable to the public.  very simply put those that sit back and complain that not enough help comes to me will never have as good of a result as those that get up and go do some thing about it themselves.  <br>  <br>  edit  to vemma  i know that not all welfare reciepients are there for ever and the stories such as yours is how it should work out. never confuse your self with the welfare class of people that they are complaining about in this type of question.  in 1981 as a high school grad i could not find a job either and saw many men like your husband standing in line for the same kitchen help jobs that i was trying for. i decided to leave town by joining the army. it worked out for me and at the time i thought it left a job for someone who needed it more.|`|T864ejaiaa	if dead beat fathers would stay with the mother of their kid(s) they wouldn't be on welfare. there are also people who can't work because of a disability. there will come a time when you will need the help and pray to god they help.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	* laughing *<br>  <br>  That's their JOB . . . don't you know that, already?<br>  <br>  The "job" of people on welfare is to sit on their couch with a tv remote close at hand and complain about how the GOVERNMENT doesn't do enough to make their lives better . . . . <br>  <br>  Isn't it the government's JOB to make our lives better?<br>  <br>  (The scary part is . . . some of you idiots are nodding and saying YES)<br>  <br>  No . . . it is NOT.<br>  <br>  It is OUR job to make OUR lives better . . .

In my state some of the inner city schools get more funding than the smaller towns which angers a lot of people. You can give inner city schools billions of dollars and they still will be dangerous and wont improve test scores because the kids don't care. It starts at home because most but not all of the parents or guardians collect and have no desire to work or push their kids to achieve in school. Plus inner city kids are into the whole gang culture which is self destructive and leads to a life of crime and possibly a prison sentence. <br>  <br>  I think this is a care where the government doesn't really care about these kids and figures giving them more funding will show people they care when they really don't.

He was told when he went on job interviews that he was either to overly qualified or not qualified enough, remember this is when the economy was supposedly better.  He finally found a job he worked 6 mos out of every year for 5 years.  I was working at the time of his great job hunt,  had a friend who was part of the welfare work team.

I mean what is the big deal unless it is not what they say it was?<br>  <br>  Second I thought about this after this couple who are very cold and thought no harm in the fact they lied about meeting at a camp and in fact neither were ever there. They made millions off of americans with this lie and even landed on the opera show two times. They were caught in their lie. Say well it was the truth in our imagnation with no remorse. So how many others are lying?<br>  <br>  Third think about this. When you are told a story over and over from childhood until you are old in age you have a tendancy to believe it. And were the camps really as big as they say? I mean I remember being about 8-9 years old and my grandmother had a bathtub that I thought was like a swimming pool. It was huge! And wonderful! I loved that bathtub. But then as a teenager about 16-17 years old I saw the same tub and argued that it couldn't had been the same one because then it looked so small. Our view of things as children are always much bigger than what they really were! <br>  <br>  Third an equal amount of christians died there as jews. but we don't talk about that because it is politicially incorrect.<br>  <br>  And last but not least the jews weren't the only ones starving to death many of the men that were in hilters military starved to death right along side of them. There simply wasn't any food at all to be had. Not just for the jews but for anyone. <br>  <br>  hmmmmm.....so personally I agree with the guy that just was removed by the pope it should be opened and relooked at. Because quite honestly I don't think it is what they say it is. There are to many things that don't add up.<br>  <br>  Like for an example in the area that they claim 6 million bodies were buried no one in that area or for miles around ever smelled anything. If you have 6 million bodies in a huge pit there is going to be odor and diseases for miles and miles around.|`|7QtY1cSmaa	As part of a lesson on prejudice the pupils of Whitwell middle school, Tennessee, attempted to collect six million paper-clips to visualise the extent of the Nazi holocaust on the Jewish community.<br>  <br>  The students met holocaust survivors from around the world. The way in which the project changed the lives of the children and transformed their community is shown in the documentary "Paperclips" made in 2004.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is true. You can buy the film.<br>  <br>  The children eventually received over thirty million paper clips from all over the world and many notable figures, including Bill Clinton, President Bush, Tom Hanks and Stephen Spielberg. Eleven million of the paper clips were eventually incorporated into a memorial for ALL the victims of Nazi persecution. The paper clip was invented by a Norwegian and the Norwegians wore them as a symbol of resistance.<br>  <br>  I know of no other connection between the Holocaust and paper clips. The figures are not disputed by any reputable authority.|`|d450c25c10c31178fd5e5d4baae544beaa	why do people defend hitler,by saying that 6  million jews were not killed<br>  millions died from all religions,across the globe during ww2<br>  us and british troops raided the camps ,and what the soldiers saw and met was absolutely sick<br>  now its 2009 and jews want to kill Palestinians ,iran wants to eradicate Israel,hmm sounds like that wee git with the lousy moustache<br>  once iran gets the bomb,we can all start to worry as their leader will find an excuse to nuke them<br>  thing is usa and ussr  knew it was a no win situation,thats why they never nuked each other<br>  but some muslim states would nuke the usa if given the chance|`|LzN2Uv8Gaa	Dude, you asked for information and Steve gave it to you.<br>  <br>  You sound like the one whom has been indoctrinated.<br>  <br>  AN or KKK?|`|JhC6BvPpaa	Well, I found this clip / trailer from the movie you're asking about.

Maybe you know something the rest of us don't, but I wonder if you could be over-reacting.  <br>  <br>  Having had friends who were involved in Far Left groups in the 1960s, I think the political and military strength of the US government is often underestimated.  <br>  <br>  Whether we're on the extreme left or extreme right, American dissidents face the practical reality that we can't achieve our favorite goals through large-scale violence: the country is just too racially and politically diverse for that, and too big.   <br>  <br>  Political extremists with a taste for violence may have the potential to create social chaos in the US that will harm almost everyone, including the political extremists.  But we don't have any realistic chance of defeating the US government in a fire fight, and no racial group in this country is big enough on its own to defeat all the others.<br>  <br>  That means we all somehow need to get along, I think, and strive for our goals through non-violent protests or regular elections.  If we try anything else, we might turn American society into a sad echo of Bosnia, with death amd chaos being an equal opportunity employer for all.  But we won't achieve anything very positive for ourselves or our chosen class or ethnic group through violence.|`|VFOB1ZVnaa	Right-wingers are primarily full of bluster.  They talk tough.  But often it ends with talk.  A few highly publicized incidents by a small minority make people think now and then.  That's no reason, however, to believe a 'revolt' is in the works.|`|V6aH1vpQaa	No, there will be no large scale revolt.  Most of these rightwing keyboard commandos are more talk than action.|`|GXxC8CIfaa	Dude take a breath....it's clear you need more oxygen!|`|dcOcokofaa	Cause and effect. The cause is socialist movements under the guise of radical left wing extremists pretending to be Democratic. The effect is 'revolt' or 'civil unrest'. Just as your party politics gradually acquire through incrementation, geographical ground will be taken by rebels. Everything you said can easily be turned around and addressed towards you.<br>  <br>  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.<br>  <br>  Declaration of Independence
8OaAmwq8aa	I agree and I am sure idiots will thumb me down for it.|`|lWZi2p70aa	Well, 'twould be socialism as the knee-jerk reaction.<br>  <br>  But an enlightened government would enforce limits to poverty and wealth.  Those don't need to be ungenerous, and they don't need to guarantee more than a marginal existence, but they really do need to be in place, lest the wealthy become a shadow government.|`|xLqMubuBaa	You could not have possibly given an ounce of real thought before posting this question.<br>  If you did actually think about it,you are a confused individual.<br>  Life is great.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	What you and most of the people with those thoughts continually fail to realize is this.  In order to get the best, you have to pay for it. If you start limited what people can earn, people won't strive to be the best anymore because they won't need to.<br>  <br>  You deserve to earn as much as you can get someone to pay you. Period.  That's how it works and it promotes self motivation to succeed.|`|My65doewaa	Yes, let's do a quick mathematical comparison..<br>  <br>  Number of countries which have adopted your economic ideas and ended up with successful economies: 0<br>  <br>  Number of countries which have accepted that rewarding people for hard and success cause economic growth: *every successful economy in human history*<br>  <br>  Not sure what that adds up to exactly, but it doesn't look good for you.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Seriously...Are you drunk?

He knows that the majority of the prisoners there will more than likely be the responsibility of the US, since the country of these prisoners do not want them or want the responsibility of them either.   <br>  <br>  There is also more depth to these stories than we will ever know and the reasons as to why they are still detained.  Perhaps one of the reasons is that these prisoners have been brain-washed and will always do as they are told...they will always be followers and obey the fanaticals of Islam, which means that they will more than likely be a threat to the US.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Obama is just like W?

There's no way to just major in spying or something at college and then show up to the CIA and apply to be a spy.  You'd be selected.  I'm sure the CIA's clandestine services are made up almost 100% of people who were doing something else and then were cross-trained into that field, while the 10 year olds who signed up to be a "spy" remained in their original career field.

DB7UMkGCaa	"Are KGB agents tortured by the enemy?<br>  like when they r captured?"<br>  <br>  One time in Lebanon a group of terrorists kidnapped 4 KGB agents, and later put out photos of the kidnapped agents, with guns held to their heads. <br>  <br>  So the KGB kidnapped the brother of the head guy of the terrorist group. They put a bullet through his brain, cut off his you know whats, stuffed them into his mouth and then sent his corpse back with a note attached to it telling the terrorist chief to release their comrades or else. The KGB agents were let go the very next day. And no Russian, no KGB agents, were ever kidnapped in Lebanon ever again.<br>  <br>  The KGB knows how to speak the language of the terrorists.|`|etcMARCAaa	Actually there isn't a KGB anymore but when there was it would depend on who captured them.  Many countries do not advocate torture simply because it is more headache than it is worth.  They might use truth drugs or threats of prosecution and execution of course.  Torture can get real information but any info obtained must still be verified because a victim or torture will also often lie to please their interrogator.  It is really only useful to confirm something you already suspect or obtain details of something you know about.  It is almost 100% useful in obtaining confessions whether they are true or not and because of this it is difficult to honestly prosecute someone who was tortured because their confession is worthless.  It is considered an atrocity by most of the civilized countries so it's bad for a countries reputation in the world community. <br>  Some countries certainly do it but not as many as we see in the movies.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	Now that you've asked the question, expect the NY Times to investigate and find even more of America's enemies have rights !

Z9jtdw17aa	I don't think you are entirely clear on what the fairness doctrine is.  It is the idea that if a network broadcasts one political viewpoint, the time should be made available on the same network to broadcast the opposing view.  It doesn't make a bit of difference whether the first point of view is left, right or orbital.  The time is made available for the opposition.  The doctrine is as likely to protect the presentation of the right wing point of view as it is the left.  Since the Democrats are getting the majority of the air time with their party in control of the Oval Office, the "opposing voice" will be the Republicans.<br>  <br>  Look to the State of the Union Address.  When Bobby Jendal or whoever gets on camera right after Obama closes his address to Congress, THAT is the fairness doctrine in action.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to listen, vote with the remote.  That's the American way!<br>  <br>  <br>  (By the way, in the interst of full disclosure, I will volunteer that  I donate to NPR.  They are rarely forced to provide time to an opposing view point, since they already interview both sides in most controversies.  I suspect you don't listen to them, if you know so little about how they operate.  Yes, they get money from the National Council of the Arts, but I'm okay with that.  I think art is worth supporting.  The news programming isn't "art" but it also isn't interested in the bottom line.  It's those bottom line driven outlets that do not give balanced coverage without "encouragement."  )|`|vSRhp7zxaa	Since no one is seriously contending for the Fairness Doctrine, this whole question is kind of moot.<br>  <br>  Obama said he doesn't support it.  There is no proposal in Congress to reinstate it, and there are at least three bills under consideration that would prevent the FCC from reinstating it.  <br>  <br>  So no one wants to decide what you listen to on the radio.  The whole idea that the Fairness Doctrine was coming back was just a scare tactic dreamed up by right-wing radio.  <br>  <br>  While no one is asking for the Fairness Doctrine, your question illustrates the danger of not allowing contrasting points of view:  you believed right-wing radio's lies on this point.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	I would almost be for it if it included TV and newspapers.  But, strangely they only want to dictate to the one media outlet that is conservative dominated.<br>  <br>  In the end, any time the government is allowed to dictate what you can say...or even worse, what you can listen too, that is a BAD thing.<br>  <br>  NPR is further left than CNN|`|PPKuHl9baa	DOWN WITH THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE!

During that time they demand full co-operation, but they are in full control. <br>     The problem is that the US comes in and gets the bad guy out. Often times this means a government and it's enforcing agencies. When they disband police forces they don't train replacement enforcement to take over when they're ready to leave. So the time comes when they've re-established order, but leaving would cause chaos as nobody would be in charge.<br>      The country's people, after years of the US running their country, don't want the responsibility and headaches that running the country entails.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	it's about oil, power ,As for [President Bush’s claim] about freedom being “written on the soul of every human being,” this is false.

Senator from the most  politically corrupt state in<br>  America <br>   whose governor is  ousted from office. The President's first official<br>  act  is <br>   to close Gitmo and make sure terrorists civil  rights are not violated. <br>   2. The U.S. Congress rushes to  confirm a black Attorney General, Eric <br>   Holder, whose  law firm, we later find out, represents seventeen  Gitmo<br>  Terrorists. <br>   3.  The CIA Boss, Leon Penetta  with absolutely no experience, has a<br>  daughter <br>   Linda,  we find out, that is a true radical anti-American  activist who is<br>  a <br>   supporter of all the Anti-American  regimes in the western hemisphere. <br>   4. We got the most corrupt female in  America as Secretary of State;<br>  bought <br>   and paid  for. <br>   5. We got a Tax Cheat for Treasury  Secretary who files his own taxes. <br>   6. We got a Commerce Secretary  nominee who withdrew due to corruption  <br>   charges. <br>   7. We got a Tax cheat nominee for  Chief Performance Officer who withdrew <br>   under  charges. <br>   8. We had a Labor Secy nominee who  withdrew under charges of unethical  <br>   conduct. <br>   9.

It would basically be the same as a watchman/security guard level. If you decide you want to do higher risk security work such as Private security Details (PSD) there are courses you can go on. <a href="http://www.nibsss.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nibsss.co.uk/</a> <br>  In the UK all security personnel from Doormen to bodyguards have to be trained and licenced by the Security Industry Association, even if you are ex military<br>  <a href="http://www.siaonline.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.siaonline.org/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The RAF Regt do have parachute units but it's not mandatory to join. <br>  If you're not a US Citizen in security work in the US don't expect to be paid well, you won't have the security clearances that a US Citizen will have from their military career so you would be low on the list for a potential emloyer<br>  <br>  The highest pay right now for security is PSD in Iraq, Afghanistan and a few small jobs in places like Haiti. Depending on the company - and the risk - pay can go from ￡150 to ￡300 a day. There is some anti piracy work but this is mainly taken up by Ex Marines. <br>  There is a lot of competition out there, a South African can afford to work for Half the money a Brit would expect, so be prepared to compete for jobs.<br>  <br>  The best job to aim for is as a security manager running a security contract, same pay, a lot less risk. This is possible if you achieve a decent Rank in the Raf Regt. and get in as many related courses as possible, civilian qualifications like HSE and Quality management<br>  <br>  edited to add: if you're looking at High risk security or bodyguarding in the US look at the laws for carrying weapons there, I'm reasonably sure you cannot be licenced if you aren't a US citizen|`|JhC6BvPpaa	You really need to talk to your local forces recruiting office in you local town. They are really nice people and offer great advice. You wont get the full picture from anyone on here YA! <br>  <br>  But -  I think that would be feasible for you to do what you said there, but you could do so much better than that. The pay is not too good in security in civvi street unless you are maybe a body guard or own / run the security company.<br>  <br>  Also, consider the alternatives, the RAF will allow you time off to go to local colleges in nearby towns and even use it's own Education Centres at 'their' expense. It's true they need good regiment people and it's a great and valuable job, but they are also in great need of technicians and they are much better paid than the regiment guys. I joined (a long time ago and I'm out now), ground electrician, brilliant job, still played soldiers, got better money than reg guys and left with a great trade. Never been on the dole queue in my life, it's really worth looking into. They also need drivers, mechanics, aircraft fitters, sparks, radio, nav inst..... Go and have a word with the recruiting officer in your local town.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, I hope you have a great time like I did on my 9+3 engagement.

My French is horrible, but I filled out the form anyway.<br>  <br>  I handed in my form and the guy said he couldn't take it because it was in French.  I would have to wait in the other line that was way longer.  Like it's my fault he can't read French?  Everything on that form is in the exact same position as the English form.  I can't read French that well either.<br>  <br>  He made it sound like it was my fault that he couldn't accept that form.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, blaming isn't good for you.

If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue <br>  of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and <br>  corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of <br>  all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their <br>  fathers conquered.<br>  <br>  Doesn't this sound eerily familiar to what is happening in America today?|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The first question to ask is "who should rebuild Iraq?"<br>  <br>  The next question which arises is "who brought ruin and destruction to Iraq?"<br>  <br>  Answer the second one, and you answer the first.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Wouldn't it make more sense to get rid of some of the states we currently have?

On top of that all the large contracts in Iraq are being taken by Bush and his cronies so basically the Iraqi occupation is costing the American taxpayer $12 Billion a month and Bush and his cronies are getting richer by the day on the expense of American taxpayers and iraqi lives.

They wouldn't -WANT- the government to do anything about it.  That's not its place.<br>  <br>  The Fairness Doctrine is an attempt by the government to 'equalize' the radio airspace with at least two prominent viewpoints on the social and political issues of today.  Sounds...fair, right?  Well, actually, it isn't.  Any program on the radio is on the radio only because of its ratings.  And it just so happens that eight out of the top ten talk radio programs happen to have a conservative viewpoint.<br>  <br>  So what does this mean?<br>  <br>  It means that the majority of radio talk listeners are...you guessed it: conservative!  So, in order to pander to its majority of 'customers' radio, like any business, keeps what sells the most airtime.  The Fairness Doctrine will change this.  It will state that what the majority of the listeners want is irrelevant.  By forcing 'equal air time' with opposing views, it will drive away a large percentage of the current listeners, thus driving down radio networks' profits.<br>  <br>  It would be like the government saying that McDonald's needs to sell salads as equally as it does burgers to pander to a 'fair and balanced diet'.  Well, that's not what McDonald's is known for and that's also forcing a private business into performing practices which would then be regulated solely by the government; it will watch how many burgers and how many salads are sold and would strictly enforce production.  Even if the majority wants burgers and -not- salads.<br>  <br>  The majority of radio listeners want conservative viewpoints, -not- liberal ones.  If liberal talk shows stay afloat by their current ratings, all power to them.  The only way they'd drop off the radar is through the only legitimate practice talk radio has been performing...just like any other business: competition.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I'm married to a Republican just like that!

There are people who want freedom of speech to only extend to their rights to say what they wish but not to those who wish to voice an opposing viewpoint.<br>  <br>  Those who complain about the liberal media will, when pressed on the issue, say that they would like see the the liberal media muzzled.  Their problem with the so-called Fairness Doctrine is that it would ensure that viewpoints that oppose theirs would be given an opportunity to be voiced.  They do not want opposing viewpoints to be heard.|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	I don't complain about the liberal media.

I disagree with the principles behind the "Fairness" Doctrine because it would not be applied evenly to all types of media.<br>  <br>  If it would be applied to television, radio and print media equally, then it would be fair and I would support it.  If it is only applied to radio, then I don't see how it is fair and I will not support it.<br>  <br>  If people don't like certain talk radio shows, they simply should not listen to them.

9f34ab31e5a41e14a739b21d2955a00aaa	The Fairness Doctrine when it is reimplemented, as it should be, must be more than an equal time provision for those who oppose whatever issue  is being discussed to be on television or radio for an equal amount of time. The "opponent" should be required to actually talk about the issue the person he is responding to discussed. This should take no longer than the first person (proponent) took to express his view, but equal discussion of the issue being the main consideration, which may take less time than the first person who is being responded to took to express his opinion. There may be more than two people who wish to respond to any issue, the main consideration should be that all varieties of opinions on a topic, should be made available to the public to facilitate thought and discussion about the issues of  these times in which we live. The Fairness Doctrine has the potential to promote democracy by increasing public awareness and participation in the issues that confront the People of the United States of America. Those who oppose the Fairness Doctrine only want to control the Message, so they can control the scope of the issues and the way they are view by the public. There can be more than one answer to a problem, and more people participating will promote better solutions that will benefit all the People of the United States of America!!!!|`|k6hicodfaa	It's completely overblown.  Even if it were to pass--which is unlikely--there is almost no way for liberals to control radio.  When the Fairness Doctrine was in effect the FCC never applied the Fairness Doctrine to a talk radio host, nor does the regulation force stations to give equal time for every perspective. Further, the point might be moot without support from the Oval Office — which the doctrine does not currently enjoy.|`|AA10087362	Many people on here say the president and congress don't support it they are naive and really don't understand Democrats, they will just frame it differently call it by another name and pass it.

But, I don't think it has a chance, anyway.|`|Hi5NyLfvaa	Almost no one supports the Fairness Doctrine.  Obama is against it.  There are three bills in Congress that would prohibit the FCC from reinstating it.  No member of Congress is proposing to restore it.  The FCC has not indicated that it wants to return to it.<br>  <br>  The concern about the Fairness Doctrine was simply a right-wing radio scare tactic, designed to make listeners afraid of Democrats.  It's just hype.|`|NJqCAdVraa	To achieve: companies wont go bankrupt, fundamentals on politics and economics, less people in the welfare.|`|6qyrhgjwaa	No  It is being done to shut up RUSH.

My parents own rental property and I know your not living paycheck to paycheck.  Especially if your going with the 1 year lease method.  Just find another tenant.  You've let him go for two months anyways clearly you didnt have a problem.  If he didn't pay you for two months you should have been getting other tenants lined up anyway.|`|KvE6eKWxaa	you can sue. do a bit of research on your county/city's landlord tenant laws. Also, think twice before you hire an attorney-will you be able to collect? does he have any money? I rented my basement years ago to a no good redneck-he didn't pay for about 6 months (thats how long it took to get him out of my property the legal way-evictions take a long time), he had destroyed the place-in the end i didn't due because i knew he didn't have a pot to piss in-why waste my time suing if i wasn't going to be able to collect?-I called it a loss and said lesson learned. you may be able to get this on his credit though!|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Well, yes if he isn't paying, no if he is.|`|AA11206283	Talk to a real estate atty; you probably can.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Your question was can you sue and the answer is yes. You have a signed lease and that is what will be needed. Dependent upon the amount of the rent you can probably take this to Small Claims Court for getting a judgment issued.

First off, if a guy is stoned everyone is going to know it.  If a person shows no particular symptoms of being loaded he's probably not.  As far as your stereotype of the 'welfare bum' kicking back on your nickle, 99% of that is total BS.  You can actually research this out and get a true picture of the situation...as they used to say on the X Files....The truth is out there.  Actually what's robbing you of your hard earned cash tends to be more a function of the commercial world than the world of government.

Yes an undocumented worker does have the right to appeal to the supreme court. Yes a Mexican in Mexico has a right to have a case adjudicated, just like any one else in the world, in the Supreme Court if that is the court it needs to be adjudicated in. If it has some relevance in the United States, and usually it is simply a question Geography.<br>  <br>  You need to read the portion of the Constitution you have posted.

The whole question is whether a certain identity theft law applies in this case.

I believe China is our primary lender. Then the government uses the money, it borrowed, to purchase stock in the banks and financial institutions.<br>  <br>  The idea is to increase the banks capital, so that the banks will then lend more to you, me and the businesses. In exchange, the government acquires preferred stocks, that are supposed to be the first stocks cashed in, after the banks are functioning normally.<br>  <br>  It's better to purchase preferred stocks, than to simply give the banks the money. At least the government will get the money, or some of the money, back, when, or if, the economy turns around.<br>  <br>  And, if the banks fail, the government will essentially nationalize them. 14 banks have failed thus far this year. And they are now owned by the government. Lock, stock and barrel.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	You haven't the faintest idea of either how stock purchases work or about how government funding works.<br>  <br>  People buy on margin.  That is, they borrow money to buy stock even when they don't have the cash on hand.  That's how investors sometimes make a huge amount of money on the markets--and how they get killed, when there is a margin call and they can't pay it.<br>  <br>  The government also buys on margin.  Only instead of having a margin account through a brokerage, the leverage comes from sale of government securities.  <br>  <br>  I don't like the strategy, but that's the way it's always been:  the government borrows to buy things.|`|dcOcokofaa	You can't borrow on the future income of your unborn grandchildren.

Ro03hVb6aa	I was once streamed to be a submariner but got removed and placed surface fleet for a variety of reasons, however, I did start to dream I was stuck in a coffin even before I went near a boat, which was an interesting but I was told pretty typical.  <br>  <br>  They are very claustrophobic and some guys do suffer from it.  I knew of one guy who basically got psychologically sent to the surface fleet as while at the conn with the wheel in his hand he had flipped when as a super tanker went over his boat after it came all of a sudden out of the submarines baffles.  He's missed the word that it was there from sonar and the noise of a 50,000 ton ship just flipped him out.  Three guys dragged him off as he couldn't handel not being able to get out of the boat and was of no use for the rest of the cruise. <br>  <br>  There are countless other tales but basically you do need a certain amount of nerve and most guys who make a career out of it get used to it.|`|YGYMocGRaa	well. im a really poor university student and live in an apartment the size of a broomcloset...got used to it after a while|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	You have to undergo very strict selection processes to be a submariner.

The story of Noah demonstrates evolution.  He gathered up two of each kind of animal.  Was that two dogs or was that two Chihuahuas, two Schnauzers, two German Shepard's?  If you REALLY want to get them going ask about Cain's wife and the people of the land of Nod.  It was only supposed to be Adam, Eve, Cain and Able.  From where did he get a wife?  And when God told him he was going to be cast out from the garden, he protested that when others found out what he'd done...

ucYwexwJaa	I can't say for certain as to the laws of Wisconsin as I"m not from there, but there are laws in place that limit the number of children you can watch at a time (between 0-12 years, I think once a child reaches 13 they don't have to be babysat).  3 seems a bit low in my opinion.  Oh, and it doesn't matter if you're getting paid or not for your newphew and nieces, they count as well.|`|AA11206283	Call the county zoning/permit center.

If you are not a 16 year old girl and you want to do the babysitting thing you need to be certified to keep your self out of trouble. Especially with you placing a add for your services. You could get in a lot of trouble if some asshole parent decides to cause a fuss over a scratch or a bump on their child cause people do that nowadays. Even when they know the child is accident prone. As far as what ur doing with you family those kids dont count because you arent getting paid for it and its family anyway. Even if u were getting paid for watching your nieces and nephews I would keep it to myself because in all actuality the money is going back to the kids anyway. I dont think you should have took out that add though because theres always that one person watching(haters) and you may get taxed for it because lets be for real the government wants a piece of everything we do in life no matter what it is.So I say If you wanna do it just do it personally with people you know, neighbors, whatever. Just keep it intimate with people you somewhat trust at least and someone who will trust you with their kids and wont really care about the legalities. You sound like a good person to take care of kids so just keep it personal and who knows you may decide while your in school to get certified...GOOD LUCK BABYGIRL!!!

When he wrote of Freedom, Jefferson then, was referring to money.  Those who have it are far more free and have a greater selection in life from which to choose than do those who have little or none.  Those who have little or no money are enslaved to their creditors.  Jefferson, was giving the King due notice that America had money and was no longer willing to be enslaved.<br>  <br>  America was founded on the notion that a man could start with nothing and amass both land and wealth.  In England at the time, only the aristocracy could do that.  In America, Washington himself was able to amass some 220,000 acres and a healthy bank account to match.<br>  <br>  Jefferson feared that any government large enough to provide everything, was also powerful enough to take everything away.<br>  <br>  All of this being true, why would anyone then, vote socialist/Democrat?  It is true also that the DNC is a private organization and as such, does not have to answer to either the masses or the government.  They pick and choose who they will and even should the people agree (on a particular person), they are free to substitute in who they like regardless.<br>  <br>  Schrillary was bashed for quipping that she knows what America needs (and was prepared to provide).  Consider now Mr. Obama who will not give you the money directly, but rather, will allow you instead a reduction in your taxes (approximately $13 / week).  What?  You are not to be trusted to make your own decision as to how best to handle your money?  Or does Mr. Obama too know what we need?<br>  <br>  Oh how nice, a thumbs down from someone who sleeps their life away, believing in fairy tales.  Every word typed is true.  If the truth hurts, perhaps then, you should question why.
AA10152260	I understand your want on this.

3ixmHSwmaa	It's not exaclty that simple. You can't bounce between state owned industry and private industry every four years.

Socialism might be what you are thinking of. Socialism is a form of economy, but it still requires some level of government involvement.  With Capitalism, the government can be disconnected entirely (and really they should be for it to work like it's supposed to). In Capitalism, the government is supposed to have little to no impact on the economy. Corporations and consumers drive the economy.<br>  <br>  With Communism though, the government controls everything about your life. They control what you can eat, what you think, what you buy, what jobs you can have, what you can drive, etc. It's not a pleasant thing and it requires full government control.|`|d7rOO1Zwaa	Communism, socialism and fascism are all one and the same. All must be forced on people, because none of them work voluntarily.<br>  Therefore, they always become a form of government.<br>  <br>  By the way, pure democracy doesn't work, either. That is why America was founded as a representative republic. Pure democracy is tyranny of the masses over the individual.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	well yes and no. The governmnt still has more control over what they deem right or wrong for the people. its not a free society system. They say what your allowed to have or not all the way down to reading material.<br>  <br>  wether your for or against chritianity, dont you think its peoples rights to read the bible if they so choose?<br>  <br>  either way, The communist model has been proven through other nations not to work.<br>  <br>  Why would we try to implment again, and ignore others examples?|`|37Q4QMF1aa	Communism is not Democracy and it is a form of Govt. where you get your facts I have no idea?|`|9dn1QRfBaa	well there is no arguing with the facts, Communism, as Karl Marx spoke of it, is indeed a classless stateless society  .... however judging by some of the answers you are getting ... not too many people understand this and it isn't because they are stupid or happen to be from the south, it's because Communism over the last century or so has received the biggest smear campaign the western world has ever perpetuated .... <br>  <br>  its a big problem with semantics too ... let me attempt to explain ... <br>  <br>  keep in mind this is going to be a VERY general description <br>  <br>  OK, Karl Marx wrote a theory where workers throughout the world would rise up and collectively manage the factories and all the means of production and they would turn their bosses into fellow workers, workers would take over governments and create worker states .... these worker states are called SOCIALIST STATES. <br>  <br>  Then he theorized that the Socialist States would one day have developed to a point where their are no more divisions of classes, no more worker and owners, peasants and shopkeepers .... he theorized that central planning would provide enough abundance in such efficient methods that the average person would work far less yet receive all that he needs ... and because the mechanisms to deliver goods and services were so efficient there was no need for a government at all ... this is what Marx called COMMUNISM ... <br>  <br>  so along comes VI Lenin, leader of the Russian revolution, he had read Marx's book called the COMMUNIST MANIFESTO .... and like many of the people that read the book he believed in it enough to call himself a Communist, meaning someone who believes in working towards the creation of a stateless classless society .... <br>  <br>  he was a member of a Communist Party, meaning a collection of persons who also believe in working towards a stateless classless society .... <br>  <br>  So a couple years later Lenin finds himself the leader of Russia and first institutes what he calls WAR COMMUNISM, a type of socialism he invents .... why did he invent this? well because Marx never really talked a whole lot about how a country is actually supposed to be organized for Socialism  ..... Lenin is largely credited for the implementation of many of Marx's ideas as he was the first to lead a successful revolution in support of Communism. <br>  <br>  so was this Communism .... well you tell me? was Russia in the 1920's a classless stateless society where there was enough abundance that no one had to work more then a couple hours a week and never went hungry and everyone managed themselves without a need for a government? <br>  <br>  no, therefore ... unless you are talking about stateless classless societies where everyone works according to their ability and receives whatever they need .... you are not talking about Communism ...<br>  <br>  OK, even simpler .... Communist Parties are made up of individual Communists who are persons that believe in working towards a classless stateless society, when these Communist Parties operate governments those governments are typically called Socialism or Socialist States or Worker States.  They are not called Communist States as Communism by definition is a stateless society. <br>  <br>  anyway ... i posted some links|`|lWZi2p70aa	I understand it well.

Among the best places to put them would e on the shoreline-closer to the major population centers so you lose less energy in transmission and the off and on shore breezes are more reliable but that would destroy the scenic view from the sea shore homes so they don't want them their.  Don't even talk to them about solar paneling covering hundreds of miles of land-plants would be restricted in where they grow and they look bad-the idea is to put those in the desert in other states and then they can get the benefits without any side effects.  Everything has side effects and wind turbines are feasible but not on a large scale; the best viable and feasible energy replacement for fossil fuel is nuclear but do not even talk about that.

We have no idea what it's like to work for what we have or to go without. Other "poor" countries teach their children 3 or more languages by the age of 12! School is very important in most countries but not here. It's more like "either go or don't go no body cares" Like you said, for not finishing school, and not to work we get paid! We get food stamps free daycare, Even flat out FREE MONEY if you qualify. Here that's called TANF. It is disgusting. And most people aren't even ashamed of living this way. They love their hand outs. and it's so sad. About 3 years ago My family moved From Florida, where my husband made up to 2 grand A WEEK, to Texas, where he had trouble finding a job so settled for whatever he could get and ended up making 300 dollars or less a week. We had to live on food stamps for about a year  because of the lack of jobs here. Thankfully he finally found a job and we no longer need food stamps. We were embarrassed to use that little card. Like trying to hide it making it look like we had a credit/debit card. It felt degrading. But we didn't have a choice. For people who need it I'm ok with that. But I KNOW people who have great paying jobs and LIE on the applications to get their food stamps!|`|xGI9z01Maa	Welfare was started to help mainly widows in 1935 by Roosevelt.  At the time, 50% were widows, 21% were women abandon by husbands, 17% were women with incapacitated fathers, and only 2% were unmarried women.  If there was a man in the house, then you would not receive money unless the father was incapacitated.  <br>  <br>  As the years passed, if a man some how couldn't get a job, he would leave the house and then the woman could get welfare for their children.  This created a situation were the man had to leave the house.  A lot of these men were black due to the fact that a lot of the jobs that they had were only seasonal such as picking cotton.  This was the start of a lot of issue that we are now dealing with today.  If you were a man and know that your children were hungry and leaving would allow your wife/girlfriend receive funds to feed the children, would you leave the household?<br>  <br>  These laws started the breakdown of system that was to help and created a chronic dependence that we see today.  With the father leaving the family, children were left with just the mother and no male in the home to guide them.  Young boys were shown that it was OK to leave a woman and young women were shown that men leave.<br>  <br>  The system also gives you more money per child which it is no more expensive to house 1 children then 4 children.  This creating larger families in area that were already poor to began with.<br>  <br>  How do we stop this cycle of abuse of the welfare system?  I'm not sure if we can.  <br>  <br>  But as far as the Black college sophomore that is struggling without government aid, I am all for keeping him is school.  At least he is trying to better himself.  In three years, he will have a job (hopefully) that he can pay taxes with to pay back that government aid with and more.  Plus if he has a degree then his children have a better chance of see that you don't have to go on welfare.  A generation that will grow up in a different view on life.  And chances are he is working harder then the boy next to him due to the difference in early education.  If he misses this chance to better himself, he might not try again.  Once you leave school it is hard to go back.|`|RZfoszJFaa	Change you can believe in?

What Obama isn't telling anyone is that we will become a third world country because everyone's standard of living will be lowered. Why would a doctor go to school for 12 years and a ton of school loans to earn the same as a garbage truck driver? Most highly paid people have high stress jobs.

The sad thing is, there are other cities and states that nothing ever changes, yet they keep electing liberals.  Cleavland is a perfect example of that.  They have the highest poverty rate in the nation for years, yet they can't bring themselves to blame the liberals.  I wonder why?|`|GHusBLjgaa	Great question, I never thought of that, I always thought California with its multi billion dollar deficit despite having one of the top 10 economies in the world was the shining example of liberal government.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	Don't forget Ohio, it's a mess too.<br>  <br>  And it's ALL the Democrats fault!!!!!|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Also, you forgot the regulations for business in Michigan.<br>  <br>  DTG
3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	Unions are wonderful for the individual that holds the job, but overall, they tend to reduce economic growth.  If you need to see what happens when unions run wild, just ask Pittsburghers about what that city was like in 1980.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Unions have a nasty history of pricing themselves out of work with all their demands. I believe they are one reason we have so many "opportunities" for illegals to come here and work cheap.Homes to expensive? Talk to the unions.Cars too expensive? The unions again. The basic idea of a union is good but like anything else they get bloated and become more of a problem.|`|XsI7ISqsaa	unions benefit workers not employers. these companies obviously wish to practice unethical work practices.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Unions suck because I can't exploit people and crush their souls to make my bread.

AA10331255	That is because it is NOT a stimulus bill.  It's nothing more than a gigantic spending bill with political payoffs attached.  Yeah...yeah...tax cuts - nothing more than smoke and mirrors.  A pittance now, then in 2010 the Bush tax cuts will be allowed to expire.  lolol...how gullible does BHO think we are??|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Some States are rejecting just portions such as the aid to unemployment because the Democrats for the first time in history want to include part time workers in it even though companies don't pay into the system for part time workers.|`|TxRRITveaa	Some might reject portions of the money because they come with strings attached that would in the long run cost the state more money because it makes the programs permanent.|`|krAlopvsaa	Good,<br>  <br>  Now the Federal Government can not give them the if you live under my roof speach.|`|89YkHxMUaa	They know that were spending money we dont have.<br>  <br>  <br>  PEABUS down there i give you a thumbs up sir.|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	The first thing that i want to know is how is this stimulus going to help if states don't take it????<br>  <br>  If it's not accepted and we are able to get out of this recession, why was this bill passed to give the government more money????|`|NJqCAdVraa	i'll be very happy to send my PayPal account if they rejected it but i think Arnold gonna send his army of cyborg to hunt me down since he reserve it first.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	I really don't care.|`|807fcae559f0d52cb9c4a617e1ab098aaa	THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTING A BAD PLAN.

Now the highest tax rate is 35%.  If we're going to become fiscally responsible again, we'll have to raise taxes considerably.  During the Eisenhower-R and Kennedy-D Administrations, the highest income tax rate was 91%.

xxDjV6Axaa	I have read all sides and also have been privy to classified information that wasn't released to the public.

It just didn't happen that way.<br>  <br>  But if you don't want to come back here and don't want to stay there, I would look at Costa Rica.

Remember Viet Nam and the FBI creating their own protests to squash. Remember that whack Reagan.  OK so the Texas gangsters started a war by killing 3,000 and then getting 4,000 more killed in a fake war. And they're almost certain to get away with it, but it's a new regime now. I think you're throwing the baby out with the bath water. It's just the yin/yang of politics. It's just that when they're bad, they're incredibly bad.|`|aVEVchFxaa	I don't know if any are really "the safest". However,  there are countries with less crimes than America.

Not sure he said that actually. I’m guessing you oppose him as republican so taking something out of context would obviously benefit you. Anyway maybe he was just telling us not to worry because the growth will balance the budget someday along with the democrats help. Please remember democrats have balanced the budget before.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	We are in debt, he is saying we wont get out of debt untill we find a sustaining way to gain positive income.

AA10282820	America is moving from being a republic (where laws rule) toward being a democracy. Democracies are short-lived types of government that always end up failing with drastic consequences.<br>   The Roman empire was at it's greatest while a republic. It was a democracy for only a short period before the Ceasars took power. "Merchantilism" as you put it is a step toward Oligarcy which often follows pure democracy as it begins to fail. When only a few affluent people hold the power to enact laws (or operate outside the laws) this is even farther to the left in the spectrum of types of government<br>  <br>  Oligarcy- the elite rule (includes: fascism, naziism, monarchy, etc.)<br>  Democracy- the many rule and rights are not guaranteed<br>  Republic- the laws rule and all must abide<br>  Anarchy- no rules and is often followed by oligarcy<br>  <br>  Please note that the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights never mention the word "democracy" nor do any of the fifty state's constitutions. Our founding fathers realized the shortcomings of democracy and chose instead to form a republic with democratic rule as a means to enact the laws of the republic.|`|NJqCAdVraa	but US got double digit debts by trillions and a deficit.|`|9bZojLXlaa	No.<br>  <br>  It's moving towards Italian-style fascism, with Obama growing the government and taking over businesses.

So I speak from experience.<br>  <br>  Marines are Held to Higher standards while on any base, camp or fort (army = fort / AF = base  / Marines = camps) (one example) Marines must walk in Cadence if more than 3 are in transition, whether to the chow hall or HQ, the other 3 branches just group together like an unorganized cluster, smoking, yelling and acting all undisciplined.<br>  <br>  Marines spend more time learning fire-team formations then the entire boot camp of the other 3 branches. Marines spend an additional 4 weeks after their boot-camp at MCT experiencing a deeper level of combat training.

Think about what makes the Army and MArines different and see which one is better suited to you.  Marines are more likely to be forward deployed to more parts of the world, especially hot spots.  The Army is a bigger part of longer, sustained conflicts.  Do you get seasick?  Would you want to be in a MEU?  Do you want to be a light Infantryman.  You could argue the Marines are the best light Infantry in the world.  Do you want to be a tanker?  The Army has more tanks, but the Marines have a few, too.  Do you want to work in aviation?  Who will give you what you want?  You need to ask more questions about yourself rather than just shotgunning "army or marines" on a message board.|`|kv5lGrSdaa	I'd say the Marines. I've known people who have been in both. While both are great the marines are more clean cut. You learn more in the Marines.

Research and talk to all branch recruiters.|`|mu6NZnzIaa	Ok ive read the answers from other people and i can tell alot have never been in the military and if they say they have they are full of BS. First off what do you want to do thats the main question you want to do. In the army your going to know your job. In the marines you get to pick a area of jobs that can cover 10 different MOS's. Everyone keeps saying the marines are more respected back home BS theres places that respect the army over the marines. In Berkly College they are banning marines from there cuz the marines are so horrible. Everyone says who gets better food and living conditions. Who cares its all the same everywhere you go, you get the same thing every day it dosent change unless something special. Yes the marines Basic is longer but who cares that means it takes longer to teach those F**king jar heads. Im and airborne ranger and we had marines that have done trainging with us and they cant hold up to what we go through. Your training all depends on what MOS you choose you can do BCT 9 weeks then AIT 6 weeks or AIT 3 yrs then you can do special schools like airborne, air assault, ranger and theres many more. The army does do longer deployments but we just went back down to 12 months its not that bad at all my first deployment was 15 months. How your conditions on deployment depends on your unit your unit's mission and your MOS. If the marines are so good why are there so many marines switching over to the army cuz they realize what the army has to offer them is better.

You will get many "bad ideas" and "good ideas".  The military isn't for everyone, and many people found that out the hard way.  It is a commitment to serving your country and doing the best you can.  The only way to know if it is right for you is to really think about it and not lie to youself.  If you can handle deployments at any time, doing odd jobs (and i mean odd), running around deserts, jungles, beaches carrying a gun, than sure.   Most jobs in the military are actually like a job, 9 to 5.  dont take the "good idea/bad idea" advice.  take your own advice.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Depends on you.

Your only motivation can not be the college money or the sign on bonus, you have to have a genuine desire to serve your country as well or enlisting will be a waste of your time and the governments.  That is actually my main point, why do you want to join the military?|`|3YBoAbGRaa	I am just now going in as army intelligence analyst.

The army has many benefits worth taking, talk to your recruiter about the benefits then go online (about.com is a good website) and research research research whatYouru recruiter has said about everything. This decision will effect the rest of your life and those around you so make sure it is the right one.|`|LETPAa6Oaa	Yes there is people that have been in the Army haha<br>  Yes it is a good idea.<br>  because blowing things up is freaken awesome, just make sure you get the right job : )|`|tEOJDjZDaa	thats a good idear bye send me back

(The unit patch is on his arm, velcro pocket area) If he has been to Ranger school and passed, he will have a yellow and black Ranger tab on his left shoulder.  He could have either, or both.  The scroll means he is stationed at a Ranger unit (1st, 2nd, or 3rd), you dont have to have been to Ranger school yet to be there.  The Ranger tab means he has passed Ranger school, but it has nothing to do with being at a Ranger unit.  Whilst in uniform he will always have a unit patch on, and a tab if he's been to school.

Other amendments do not have this sort of language in them (not that others aren't open to interpretation and debate).  <br>  <br>  It's obvious from my own study of the Revolutionary period of American history that the Founders recognized that one of the reason the British were defeated was because ordinary citizens with their own guns were able to be called to arms almost at a moment's notice.  It's much more efficient and sometimes more effective than troop movement--and much more difficult for scouts to ascertain the threat.<br>  <br>  While I agree with gun advocates that the Second Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to keep and bear arms, I also recognize that it was not the most forward-thinking amendment in the U.S. Constitution.  The Founders weren't counting on Howitzers, helicopter gunships, and missiles, I'm sure.  They had just repelled an invading army due in part to the military prowess of George Washington, the help of the French, and the actions of ordinary citizens mounting guerrilla attacks on the redcoats.  The British lost so many troops to the guns of locals, it was undeniably an excellent strategy against foreign invasion to keep citizens armed.  <br>  <br>  I think people need to be educated about guns and peaceful resolution of conflict more than they need to be forced to give up their arms or taxed outrageously on ammunition.  I think both sides of the gun control debate have too much zealotry to be reasonable, and we have to find middle ground that does not infringe on our Constitutional rights.|`|2HC8CB3haa	For most Americans, regardless of party, the second amendment allows for restrictions on arms. People are not allowed to own tasers, missiles, working tanks, etc., so the right to bear arms already has some significant restrictions. The argument between the right and left is only in the details, which arms they think people should be allowed to bear. <br>  <br>  Those who interpret the second amendment as serving the individual right to bear arms are interpreting in their own convenient way: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Obviously, the goal of this amendment is to support a well-regulated militia, i.e., the US military. Perhaps what we could do is what they do in conservative Switzerland. Almost all citizens have rifles, but the bullets are kept in special sealed cans that can only be opened in a national emergency.|`|Ocyrox5baa	4, I'm sure search and seizure will be fair game.|`|NqNbIp2caa	Well the only one the founding fathers felt a need to qualify as collective (by assigning it to well regulated militias) was the 2nd.

Where else would people unconcerned over their vehicles single-digit gas mileage send their youth off to die for the cheap oil needed to run them?

The home of the brave is a place where going to war to keep the Humvee tanks filled is seen as both desirable and an entitlement by virtue of UStatesian consumership.  Citizenship is old thinking Big Brother says.  Those who do not shop are not with us.

AA11206283	uh..I believe what an impared driver does or does not remember won't be worth much in a court. I'd get a lawyer if you can afford one just because he may be able to reduce your DUI sentence.|`|AA10118655	"Is it worth getting an attorney and fighting this?"<br>  <br>  If you are charged with DUI, I would say this is your best chance. It may cost more up front than a fine would (assuming this is your first offense), but, if you win the case or have the charges reduced, it will save you a lot more money in the long run since you insurance premiums will not go up so high. Also, a lawyer can better advise you on the other charge(s) you may have, and if you have a chance to get out of those also.|`|F6yfJSr9aa	DUI can be complicated.  I think it would be in your interest to consult with an attorney to better understand the potential issues.  It probably isn't a good idea to just post legal questions on Yahoo (trust me, I had a bad experience), when many of the members don't know what they are talking about.  With such an important issue like DUI, you def. need to contact a lawyer, even though I know they can be expensive.  When I had a legal problem, I used www.quicklegalanswer.com for my legal stuff and was surprised how fast an attorney answered my question.  It was very cheap and helped me put my mind at ease.  Anywho, just thought it would be a good idea.  If you need anything else, let me know.

pNy8lakjaa	These are two completely different countries.. <br>  <br>  Canada: Its made up of Providences, and has a Prime Minister. All Providences are primarily English speaking except for Quebec, which uses both French and English. Vancouver and Toronto are the biggest cities of this country. The Canadian dollar is a wee bit weaker than the American dollar, however the health care system is nationalized. <br>  <br>  America: Is made up of states, and is a total melting pot full of different cultures from all over. The dollar is pretty strong, but if you get hurt, be prepared to spend a lot of money if you don't have health insurance. This country is more diverse in climates compared to Canada. <br>  <br>  If I could live somewhere, it I would totally choose Vancouver, I heard the British Columbia providence is beautiful!|`|fSlZQzS4aa	It is warmer in the USA|`|xGI9z01Maa	Canada did not break away from England.

jgRRsG8Daa	Yes but political parties play a fraud on the public by appointing a <br>  candidate defeated( by the electorate) at the election to Parliament,as a Minister and getting him elected as a Rajya Sabha Member.And our<br>  politicians have the gall to remind us that we are a democracy.That is <br>  hypocrisy of the highest order.|`|cWuumdy7aa	to be appointed as a Minister in the cabinet you need not be member of any house Lok sabha or Rajya sabha.you can be minister without being a member of either houses but after the appointment as a minister within 6 months or 180 days he should become member of either of the houses.if he fails to become member in 6 month his appointment becomes invalid.|`|rCr3uqt9aa	Yessssssss    Dr. Manmohan Singh is Rajya Sabha Member and he is P.M Praful Patel is R sabha member (Civil aviation minister) Former Home minister Shivraj Patil …….

7OQWOaGmaa	Solution you have in mind is too simply for our government & banks to see.  I might mention, also, the fair process.|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	This would work if the houses were still worth what they were on the first barrow. But they are not, in some places they are worth half. So in order to refinance for any amount of time the house would have to be worth 80% of what the loan is. If a $400,000 home is now worth $200,000. The down payment that would be needed would be $240,000. There is no Mortgage insurance that would take on this kind of gamble and if there were it would be so expensive that it would cost more than the original house payment that isn't affordable to the people getting foreclosed on.|`|6c02d02bf857232422a679628b4b9402aa	No.<br>  <br>  Then people will never own a house.<br>  <br>  What about lowering the interest? If they have a trillion dollars in loans and charge 2%, aren't they making money?|`|AA10465540	Better than what?|`|VSB98koJaa	The reason why not is because it is illegal under contract law.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	Due to the compound effect of interest, stretching a home loan out to 50 or even 100 years will not lower the payments enough to help these people.<br>  <br>  Going from 30 to 50 Years, will only lower a payment by 10-15%. Remember most of the first 10 years payments on a 30 year mtg is interest. So going 50 years significantly raises the interest expense  and does not lower the payments enough. <br>  <br>  Also, remember the monthly tax and insurance escrow amount will not change. Taxes might drop a little as home prices fall, but remember why the property taxes are collected--to keep local/state govt's operating. These local/state govts will collect the funds they need no matter the value of a home. As for Insurance costs, the homeowners policy will have to be at least the value of the mtg note. <br>  <br>  Most Mtg. monthly payments are made up of about 35% Taxes/Ins. escrow and 65% Loan Pmt. So as in most loans the 65% is all you can impact.<br>  <br>  The fix is simple, when you buy something on credit you cannot pay, you lose it. That includes a Home, Auto, Boat....That is what was agreed to when you got the full amount of the loan and that is what you are obligated to pay.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Well yes and no, the problem being here is how do you claim a 50 year pay period and still consider it a secure loan... consider lets say if i buy a house at age 30, id be 80 by the time its payed off, and most people retire it 65-70 if not sooner. It makes for good recovery, but not a reality for keeing the house if that is indeed the idea.<br>  <br>  It has points, but at the same time, really it would only be good to give people a chance to get out.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	First off, if you can't afford a 30 year mortgage then you don't belong in the house. A 50 year mortgage isn't much better than an interest-only mortgage.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the home values don't impact your ability to pay a mortgage payment. There's no need to do anything except ride out the housing market drop until it goes back up.  Primarily, don't move and don't try to sell the house.  <br>  <br>  In other words, home value has nothing to do with foreclosure. Trying to live off of home equity loans I suspect is a bigger part of the problem, but that's a dumb thing to do from the start.
t3QAaSN9aa	I think you are a little confused.  40 percent of the United States GDP (Gross Domestic Product) comes from 5 States: California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois.

yvPA8FSsaa	There is no such thing as a government with equal power.  Either someone is in charge or no one is in charge.  That is the lie of Communism.  They preach that everyone owns everything but the reality is the government owns everything and the people own nothing.  They do not even own their own selves or their children.  They do not own their own homes or farms or businesses.  They do not own their own jobs or own lives.  <br>  <br>  The "collective" is all that matters.  Individuals are expendable.  You have no rights except what the all powerful central government thinks you should have.  There is no sense of moral absolutism only moral relativism.  There is no God.  Religion is outlawed because it threatens the authority of the government.  <br>  <br>  The only people who are enamored by Communism are people who have never lived under it.  <br>  <br>  *|`|qKr5wRxyaa	China nor Russia where ever communist. <br>  <br>  Lenin was never able to get Russia passed the state capitalism stage. <br>  <br>  After Stalin became a dictator and seized power the idea of communism was abandoned. Btw more people died under the Czars than Stalin. Not defending him, just putting things into perspective. <br>  <br>  According to Marx,  A REAL COMMUNIST ECONOMY  consists of local or communal democratic planning.<br>  <br>  There is no govt. form today that can describe it. <br>  <br>  The only reason so many people are ignorant about it is because it is a "threat" to the rich and powerful and challenges their way of life of exploiting the huddled masses under their control. The most hopeless slaves are the ones under the illusion that they are free, like some of the naive answers on here. Most people only re-iterate propaganda feed to them. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One thing Marx said that pretty much everyone ignores is that you have to go through the full cycle of capitalism and industrialisation in order to get a society capable of socialism or communism. democratic socialism works just fine in countries like Norway or Sweden. countries like Cuba might work out if they weren't being economically blockaded by the richest countries in the world. and the Soviet Union and its satellites attempted to go straight from a feudal/agrarian system to communism. it was forcing the cycle forward without going through an industrial age, and of course did not work.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You are unlikely to get an objective answer here, as communism is against economic and capitalist interests of the United States and most citizens know nothing. They only repeat the fallacious arguments and information given to them by the corporate media and govt. serving political figures. It's very funny on the flaming double standards the capitalists place on themselves. Capitalism, mostly in it's last stage called IMPERIALISM was responsible for over 100 million innocent deaths in the 20th century. <br>  Intervening in countries in order to preserve non-freedom (e.g. invading the DR in 1965) or subverting democratically elected governments and replacing them with authoritarian governments that adopt policies in line with Washington while going against the will of the population, qualifies as imperialist (as was the case in Guatemala in 1954, Brazil 1964, Chile 1973, and so on). If you like, I will gladly provide you more than two dozen examples where the US managed to distort elections in other countries since WWII. Also, since WWII the US has attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments. Why was she able to use this phrasing and keep a straight face while everyone else kept a straight face as well? To me, the answer seems quite clear. The United States has invasion rights. So, if the US decides it's going to go into Pakastan (which we've managed to do), then we'll come up with some justification for it and it's okay, since we did it. But if Russia decides to go into Georgia (a conflict Georgia started, btw) and a few thousand people die we start going off about Russian imperialism. dropping napalm, cluster bombs, agent orange, etc. on people. Burning factories, crops, and starving innocents in Cuba. Supporting right wing non-democratic coups that care about big business more than their people, assassinating leaders that would rather use the resources of the country to help their people instead of selling out to big business, and what about the other little adventures?  what was the good thing we were trying to do when we gave decades of diplomatic and military support to Indonesia while they invaded East Timor and slaughtered 1/3 of the population? What was the good thing the US was trying to do when it dropped millions of tons of bombs on Vietnam (North and South) in order to prop up a puppet regime in the South? Or, what about in 1982 when the State Department took Saddam's Iraq off the list of states supporting international terrorism so that we could start sending aid in their war of aggression against Iran?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Communism is an economic system and way of life where all the means of production are collectively owned by the people. There is no "owners and employees". There is no divisions of classes. If you don't work, you don't eat. You keep what you produce.<br>  <br>  Soviet Russia and China WERE NEVER COMMUNIST. Look at the various definitions of communism on wiki, dictionaries, etc. and you'll see it's nothing like Soviets.<br>  <br>  <br>  REAL COMMUNISM seeks to abolish the state and all of it's instruments, not replace it with a dictatorship.<br>  <br>  Communism according to Marx is a cycle.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't listen to imperialist propaganda. Under the current system 1% of the rich ppl own 50% of the worlds resources. Every 4 seconds someone dies of hunger. NOT because they don't work, but because we live in a world run by greed and bottom lines instead of well being for all peoples.<br>  <br>  The people that say "capitalism is human nature" are ****ing themselves because the world was better without mercantal<br>  <br>  Communism is a society where everyone is equal. It strives to make the resources of the world (water, food, products, etc) owned by everyone.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  True communism has never existed. China nor Russia were ever true communist economies.<br>  <br>  People need to look at actions and not what people call themselves. The governments of Russia and China could be referred to state socialism/authoratarian capitalism. Listen to the facts shared to us with comrades that have taken the time to write out the work.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  one thing Marx said that pretty much everyone ignores is that you have to go through the full cycle of capitalism and industrialisation in order to get a society capable of socialism or communism. democratic socialism works just fine in countries like Norway or Sweden. countries like Cuba might work out if they weren't being economically blockaded by the richest countries in the world. and the Soviet Union and its satellites attempted to go straight from a feudal/agrarian system to communism. it was forcing the cycle forward without going through an industrial age, and of course did not work.<br>  <br>  UNDER REAL COMMUNISM THE GOVT. DOESN'T CONTROL YOU. It doesn't exist! All the resources are owned collectively by the people. If you get sick and need medical care, you get it.

AA11163314	The President being slauted and returning that slaute is a tradition that started back in the days where every President had served in the military as an officer.  Since an officer's commission is 'for life' any former officer technically retains his highest rank held after he leaves the service.  In the beginning, the military personnel were not saluting the 'President' - instead they were saluting the military rank held by that President in the past.<br>  <br>  When Clinton took officer there was a debate in the military whether he should or should not be saluted when he had never served.

Essentially, we will all be carrying our children into battle so that our families do not have to suffer hardship and then right before we get onto the lines or leave the wire, we drop our kids off with those TCCC Airmen.  We also have to pull the car seats out of our humvees before we roll, so you may be responsible for making sure the right child is matched up with the right car seat when we come back.

In every stage of my education from a young child now to advanced university studies, I have been taught and come to the conclusion there were two aspects to the Vietnam War and the US lost in one sense and had only minor successes in the other.<br>  <br>  Strictly militarily, the United States was making progress. Any major military offensive made by the enemy was repelled (ironically much like Afghanistan and Iraq), but the US began to struggle in Guerrilla warfare situations. One major example is the Tet offensive in which the US military prowess shined through.<br>  <br>  However, if you look at that same battle the Tet Offensive, the United States lost from a morale aspect. Many historians believe that at this sight, the public at home began to dissent military action most feverishly. The US lost the mental battle (for many reasons) and in this sense it is very apparent in modern society.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it is helpful to mention that many military novels and critiques of the war show that it was not a success by the United States and I would agree that the majority of the public is under the same impression. <br>  <br>  So, sir, I politely disagree with your own assessment as being just as biased and self-serving as you claim many Americans to be.|`|AA10023996	The American Military did not lose the war and they were well on their way to winning.

I was LE. The hours were bad at times, but the work was fun (remember, I was LE not security) and soon the hours were more routine. I did 7.5 years, finished college.<br>  <br>  ATC is also a good career field. I had friends who did that in the AF, and they liked it. But - they work the same hours as Security Forces. The tower is manned 24/7.<br>  <br>  Have you checked into being a medic? It's hands-on, you work with people, you're in a clean environment, and you get a lot of college credit for the training. [But, it has 24/7 hours in some cases, like the ER - but not the clinics]. The training also set you up for civilian EMT.<br>  <br>  Talk to AF vets. They'll let you know what they liked and disliked. Don't focus too much on the hours - they soon get to be routine.

9FRE9maSaa	Hi... I would recommend the Air Force.  I spent 13 years in the Navy (many years ago) and I loved it every minute of it but if you are looking for a much better quality of life and a situation more like a normal life and much less moving around the world, the Air Force makes the most sense.  My experience was the Air Force built enlisted and officers clubs first, living quarters second, and the air field last. That way, if they ran out of money, it would be much easier to get more to build the air field than living quarters or clubs.  Good luck, whatever your decision turns out to be.|`|OQb533GPaa	Navy is known for their excellent medical programs, however Air Force will treat you better . . . why not join a guard unit?  This will give you more freedom anyway.  www.ang.af.mil  If you know somebody that is already in the guard they can recruit you through the guard recruiting assistance program and get a bonus of $2000.  Sometimes they have deals where if you go officer it's more . . . just in case you want to give a friend a little boost in income.<br>  <br>  Also things to consider, since you are 28, you'll probaby have to get a waiver for joining the military along with a whole bunch of other things, just saying it's a lot of work.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind when you visit the recruiter, get everything in writing . . . no matter how nice they might seem or how smart you are they will screw you over.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Neither would send you to combat.

As for the yelling, just think of it this way, they are yelling to be sure everyone hears them and that other people don't make the same mistakes as the person they are yelling at. Different Training Instructors vary in degrees of "yelling". <br>  It seems like BMT takes forever but when you're done you'll think it  went fast... I always looked at it as 6 Sunday's, or whathave you. <br>  <br>  The gas chamber was being built when I went through, but from what I've heard it's just tear gas and it just makes your eyes and skin irritated and it burns. You'll go in with masks on and they'll have you take them off for probably 2 or 3 minutes, they'll be in there asking you your SSN or various rank questions to see if you can still remain calm and handle the situation.<br>  Most entering basic will be paid as an E-1<br>  E-1 with less than 4 months in $647.50 every 2 weeks<br>  Though some, if you have JROTC or College and have it written in your enlistment contract like I did can be paid as an E-2 or E-3 going through basic, you just don't get to wear the stripes until you graduate.<br>  E-2 $700 every two weeks<br>  E-3 $825 every two weeks<br>  I got ranked up to an E-3 after I graduated Tech school per my contract, most for signing up for 6 years get this but you don't get any rank or payraise until you graduate, bonuses are the same way, I didn't get my enlistment bonus until I got to my first duty station...about 3 months or so after...<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  -Sarah

I went through it after being married for 9 years.<br>  <br>  I assume your husband is back in the US? If so then he needs to start by filing an I-130 with the USCIS. This will automatically start you on the path to CR-1/IR-1. He can file for K-3 after he gets the NOA from the I-130.<br>  <br>  K-3 may be quicker but you should know that the K-3 visa is a non-immigrant visa and once you're in the US, you need to apply to adjust your status to CR-1/IR-1.<br>  <br>  For me, the K-3 came to nothing and we abandoned at the point we began paying the fees for IR-1.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

The only reason they banned it is because they say people long, long ago started to act a fool but what they dont realize is that those same people were also drinking COCA COLA when it really had ''COKE" in it. That was the problem not the miracle plant. And they say it cant be taxed but in all actuality it can. Just think about it. The government are the ones putting it back out on the streets after its taken from drug dealers. They know the street value therefore they can tax it, wholesale! I mean come on they can tell you how much its gonna cost to raise a baby before its born and round up that child support to lock guys up but they cant tax mary-j please! Its just another way to keep law enforcement, judges, and politicians employed. Think about, even if that cant actually tax it they can tax the hell out of smoking instruments...DUH..I dont get it myself. And then like I said its a freakin' plant it grows from mother earth!!!

Last semester, my first semester at college I essentially smoked everyday and I got a 3.67 GPA. It's all about having balance and good time management if you want to be successful and still smoke marijuana.

They tax alcohol, and it is easier to produce at home than marijuana is to grow. <br>  <br>  Juice, sugar, water, and yeast, all found at your local supermarket.

Just like marijuana would be if it was legal. Instead of waiting for it to grow, you can just go purchase it and pay the tax.|`|F5GyrdQfaa	No, they do not legalize it for a combination of ethical concerns and the benefits garnered to the state due to it's criminalization.<br>  <br>    Ethically, politicians do not want to be seen as responsible for the declining morality of youth. While it does not follow that a person who likes alcohol is immoral, for some reason most people place the cart before the horse when it comes to other drugs. Maybe someone doesn't like beer, but prefers smoke. Well, the drug is illegal, therefore the person who smokes it is immoral.... The political classes do not want to address the fundamental flaw with this logic because the masses who support prohibition never want to address it.<br>    Secondly, every person in prison on drug charges generates income to the government. Their possessions are confiscated and sold, and taxes must be raised to provide for the facilities of incarceration and pay the guards. When 40% of our prison population is there due to drug charges, one should wonder if this is a case of a law making a criminal, rather than a criminal in need of a law.<br>    They COULD tax it. Tax the heck out of it! Even if some people could grow it themselves, that's a wait of several months, and the expenditure of resources (land, water, fertilizer)...now c'mon, how many smokers out there would wait that long? No...there'd be lines to buy it, taxes or no, because the prices would drop dramatically due to the loss of "danger" incentive pricing.|`|UGAZhGqJaa	i think that the reason the government does not make bud legal is because 1.) they cannot tax weed, 2.) because the government is a bunch of douchbags who have nothing better to do than make peoples lifes shitty by busting them for the most harmless plant.<br>  stupid shitty *** government, ****** with peoples lifestyles.|`|bb62b472c10e5f1e2265d24d4ab21972aa	Thats pretty much the only reason.

No. Military is all voluntary.|`|0LlWIJoxaa	no he can't, completely illegal.|`|TjjCAvk5aa	No you're no longer a minor so he cannot legally force you to do anything, but even if you were under 18 he still couldn't|`|LETPAa6Oaa	Nope your 18, he can threaten you all he wants about enlisting you but he can't.<br>  but you didn't hear it from me...<br>  haha|`|AA10823119	NO.    its just an out dated threat|`|YGYMocGRaa	he cant do that! ur 18!|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Since you're over 18 you are in charge of your life, he cannot enlist you.  However, if you're living under his roof he has the right to say anything he wants about your choices.|`|Ot7PJrddaa	No - he cannot enlist you.  You are a legal adult and only you can enlist.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	Even if he could, just tell them during your medical that you have athsma they won't accept you, then your father has run out of threats.<br>  <br>  He seems to be a control freak and doesn't like it that your now outside his sphere of influence.|`|9d9b8b9e4972c1f3e7d9b9e80936b200aa	He can not enlist you, that is completely up to you.  however, what he can do is cut off any and all money he is giving you for college, rent, food, etc. until you enlist or change your ways to suit him|`|AA10829482	No, he can't make you join the military.  He can cut off any financial support he is providing so be prepared for that.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Like everyone has mentioned above, he can not enlist you.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Heck NO! It is a completely volunteer army. Your father has no authority over you, since you are a legal adult. The only one that can sign the dotted line is you, not your father. Remind your father about the US Constitution and the rights guaranteed by them. The Military purpose is to defend that document. This is baffling, really. Look up the 13th and 14th Amendments.|`|AA11593134	he can do anything he wants to do, but if you don't show up and sign the document (for enlistment), and swear in, you're not in...<br>  by the way, I enlisted in the Air Force.<br>  : )<br>  But then he might find another way so you would stop seeing those friends. So I would start listening to him once in a while (or until you get your own place)...|`|AA11429715	No he can't.  He can't sell you into slavery either. On the other hand he is under no legal obligation to continue to support you.  It's all part of being an adult.

Just wondering, because if you dont start being nicer to him and stop acting like a spolied brat then he can stop paying for your school.|`|au0ssSnvaa	If he's paying for your college then he could threaten to stop. He can't force you to do much else outside of move out of his house.|`|A728LXj6aa	Absolutely he cannot.

After getting your civilian qualifications, you can go in as an officer/nurse.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	1. The Air Force pays 100% tuition assiatance while on active duty to take college class's in your off duty time.<br>  <br>  2. Why are you assuming you will work a day shift ? You could just as easily be working midnight to 8 am.<br>  <br>  3. Yes, it is hard to be on active duty and take college class's, you have to budget your time.<br>  <br>  4. Your not gonna be going to school full time on active duty, you will be taking one or two class's at a time.<br>  <br>  5. Yes, you can earn a degree on active duty, just don't expect to earn it in 4 years.<br>  <br>  6. It is easy, you just ask to work the 4 pm to midnight shift or the midnight to 8 am shift. Then you can take class's at a local university during the day.<br>  <br>  7, Figure on it taking about 7 years to earn your BSN while on active duty.<br>  <br>  Most likely what you would do, is take as many class's as you can, while on active duty for 4 years, then get out of the AF and use your GI Bill to complete your BSN at the university of your choice.<br>  <br>  You could easily get two years worth of college out of the way while on active duty for 4 years.|`|AA10829482	It depends!  A lot on  your job and also where you get stationed.  <br>  <br>  I have a friend who was SF and she worked nights so she could go to Nursing school during the day....I don't know how she managed on so little sleep but she did. <br>   <br>  there are a few nursing schools that offer night and weekend classes but not very many.  <br>  <br>  You might consider looking into ROTC - they have scholarships esp for nursing students - the catch is that you have to be accepted into a nursing program which typically happens your sophmore/junior year.|`|0LlWIJoxaa	why not just become a medic, that way the air force will teach you how to be a nurse and you still have the GI Bill|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Have you spoken with a Health Care recruiter?  That's who you need to speak with.  It's my understanding that they are actively recruiting folks to be nurses and paying for the schooling.  I don't know all of the ins and outs of the program, but definately worth checking into.  A Health Care or Officer recruiter will have more specialized knowledge about what is going on in the officer corp and what is available.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just found this!!<br>  US Air Force Nurse Enlisted Commissioning Program   <br>   <br>   <br>  The Nurse Enlisted Commissioning Program (NECP) offers active duty enlisted personnel the opportunity to earn a Bachelor’s degree in a high-demand academic major.  Upon completion of NECP and passing the National Council Licensure Examination, students will be commissioned then attend Commissioned Officer Training and the Nurse Transition Program, with PCS/PCA to final assignment location.<br>  <br>  NECP applicants must have at least 59 semester hours completed before applying to the program.  Students will complete the last two years of their degree at a college or university with an AFROTC detachment of a college/university that has a “cross-town agreement” with a college or university with an AFROTC detachment that is in the area.<br>  <br>  So... you could whip out your first 1/2 of your degree as enlisted, then jump to this program.  TA would cover 100% of tuition for those classes, you would just have to pay for books.  Also, the AF has a great CLEP/DANTES program, totally free of charge for active duty.  So, you could knock a bunch out that way as well.

Both of us had good jobs working for the same company. We live in a modest home that we had for ten years. The mortgage payments were reasonable. Life was good, until last February.<br>  Both of us lost our jobs. It took six months for me to find another job, which pays me a little over 1/2 of the salary I used to make. My wife has been unable to find any work that will cover the cost of childcare.<br>  The job I have has no medical benefits, so I must pay the cost of health insurance. Since my wife has a chronic condition, the policy cost over $800 a month.<br>  Now, the home we have been paying on for over ten years has become too much for us to handle. Unfortunately, we cannot sell it because of the flat market. In addition, it has lost so much value over the past two years that any equity we had was lost.<br>  Although we are not on the verge of foreclosure yet, the situation still sucks.

But, in all nations there is a pool of impoverished, starving, sick - mentally and physically - that cannot meet their own basic needs because they are at the very bottom of the heap economically, and in access to medical care, food, and many other things that we accept as normal for our lives, and that we would squeal about if we were to be denied access to them for any reason.<br>  <br>  If you watch the present US economy - for example - you will discover that many decent people that have worked hard all their lives, now find themselves out of work, out of their foreclosed homes, and out of hope for rescue any time soon.<br>  <br>  It is in times such as these that the principles of socialism recommended by Jesus Christ, you know, 'love they neighbour just as much as you love yourself, and treat them as you would wish to be treated,' are highly valuable for saving lives, young and old, and for supplying basic needs until the economy recovers - could be years - and life gets back to normal, if, indeed, it ever can be normal again.<br>  <br>  It is not only futile, but inhumane to carp about massive efforts to save fellow citizens that through no fault of their own find themselves in dire straits.  <br>  <br>  The Bush administration did nothing to help the victims of the disastrous consequences of its non-existent financial oversight in the face of compelling evidence that the slide would get worse and cause suffering to millions of people who were and would become innocent victims of Bush's failure to preside over the essential solidity of US financial institutions.<br>  <br>  Obama is reaching out to those in greatest need and also moving to secure manufacturing industries and the millions of workers and their families that are dependent on incomes from those jobs.<br>  <br>  That is no one's idea of rewarding failure and punishing success other than those who describe Bruch's Violin Concerto in D as, "Horsehair Scraping On Catgut." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  QUILL|`|zftm6qkKaa	We know, we know, you want all of it.

AN5lf1u9aa	Don't put off your pre boot camp training another day. I would start with walking a few miles a day, eventually adding in some running. Your goal should be able to run for at least 30 minutes comfortably before you get to boot camp. Also incorporate push-ups, squats, lunges, and sit-ups.  These are all exercises you can do without a gym membership. After a month of training give yourself a practice PT test and see how you score based on the guidelines for your age and height. Keep testing yourself every month to track your progress.Work hard now, and it will pay off later. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|sLEdPDkHaa	i have a little to add, try doing 1 more rep of whatever is part of your PT test for your branch everyday so you progress upward but don't wear yourself out|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Try this site it should help you out...<a href="http://www.military.com/military-fitness/" rel="nofollow">http://www.military.com/military-fitness...</a>|`|tXZTi73kaa	I don't know which service you are joining but in the Marines, a perfect PT score is 20 pull-ups (FULL-EXTENTION!!!), 100 sit-ups in 2 minutes, and 3 miles in 18 minutes.  Work your way up to that and you'll be good for ANY service!!<br>  If you're going for a minimum score, it's something like 3 pull-ups, 50 sit-ups, and 3 miles in 28 minutes.<br>  If you can do that minimum I listed, the drill instructors at bootcamp will take care of the rest for you... haha.  If you can't do that minimum, they'll put you in a holding platoon until you can.|`|i5eUB0DIaa	My recruiter gave me a boot camp training book for getting ready for it and I dont have it with me right now its in my car but I believe it is "Flexing, then sit ups, then jog 2 miles, then pull ups, and stretch again". I still got 1 year before i have to go in to the marines Delayed entry program so I havent fully commited to the workout yet. I will soon tho :P.<br>  <br>  BTW there are supplements for pullups such as dumbells curls, and others.|`|YjhlhUzVaa	You need to run 2-4 miles daily. Once a week do a "fartlek" (interval training) workout at a track. Every other day you need to do pyramid sets of dead hang pull ups, as in 2,3,4,5,5,4,3,2, then increase to 3,4,5,6,6,5,4,3 and so on as it becomes easier for you. Do 5 sets of 20 crunches 3 times a week. Don't miss a workout.|`|AA10037740	learn to run two miles under 15:00 minutes and do 54 sit-ups in two minutes and do 47 push-ups in two minutes. theres ur PT test...|`|ad14ac684db1a206e4dee1e9b1ee74b0aa	It will depend on your weak points; Boot will get you in shape pretty fast regardless of your current condition but if your not use to say running, start by building that up. twice around the block for 2 weeks then 3 times around etc... Depending on which branch your joining, they may emphasize your ability to do pull ups or running.
PPKuHl9baa	Seriously? If children could be taken away for those reasons there would be a lot more kids in foster homes in this country. I have tats and a beautiful baby girl.

JzxiZkEAaa	I agree with you whole heartedly.<br>  <br>  increasing corporate taxes never works for a capitalist economy. Obama is trying raise these tax rates for reason that makes no sense to me. You raise the tax rates and every employee of that company takes a hit - he is taking the money right out of our pockets.<br>  <br>  Last year Exxon Mobil had a revenue of over 400 billion dollars and paid 120 billion in federal taxes - tell me what small company that made 400,000 a year would put up with being taxed 120,000. <br>  <br>  Now the government wants to take hour money, scramble it around, and give it back to us in the form of a check - what good is it really going to do? a family receives 1000 bucks in the mail and this is supposed to get them out of the economic crisis? How far will that money go? as we dig ourselves further and further into debt. <br>  <br>  This administration is going to drive us into the ground. For the sake of America I hope I am wrong but we are headed for a total collapse of our economy at this point.|`|VDgAJETtaa	You mean corporations USED TO EMPLOY PEOPLE that pay taxes.  When corporations press the button, and all their workers fall through the trap door, what happens to those workers?  CORPORATIONS have been laying off /firing people with no severance.  A law firm in NYC even went as far as to issue final payroll checks to workers, only to have those checks bounce.  You may be on you knees giving a hummer to corporations, but most smart people understand that corporations are out for themselves.  When times get bad, you better put on your bikini, because you are going swimming.  And a lot of people are out there with no swimsuit on, in frigid waters.  The government is trying to pull as many people as they can into the lifeboat. The bottom line is this: The government would rather be spending a trillion dollars somewhere else, but they can't.  Hoping and praying that corporations will figure out how to be profitable is ridiculous, and irresponsible.  Obama can't win either way; if he spends money he wrong.  if he decided to divert money to corporations, after corporations spent tax payer money like drunk sailors, he would be considered a criminal.  If you are going to get criticized, at least be able to say you were looking out for the citizens of the US, and not CORPORATIONS.|`|c260a0ddad39badea036a75535635dd3aa	Regular welfare is meant to help people during hard times...

The best way to do that is by fear.  When people are fearful they get discouraged.  When people are discouraged they do not vote thinking it doesn't matter.  That is the Republicans basic strategy.  Keep the lower class discouraged, stop them from having ans sense of hope, keep them away from the voting booths.  The Republicans know that is the only way the can actually win an election.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	This recent bout of corporate welfare hasn't done a damn thing for the economy either.<br>  <br>  When the bailouts were given out, how many people do you know that got hired by those companies?|`|zftm6qkKaa	We need assurity, not prozac.

Did they hire more employees?  No, but they gave huge bonuses to the people in management who had already caused the banks to have enormous losses.<br>  <br>  The evidence is clear:  corporate bailouts go into the pockets of management, not for job creation.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Having read a number of your questions I have just come to the assumption that you will just generalize all liberals having the same values and morals of Barack Obama and therfore no matter what I answer I get thumbs down from you and every other "Common Sense Republican" as you so intelligently put it.  Having said that, welfare has been abused for 10 years already with people who are on it illegally and people who realize between Welfare and WIC and govt housing they can live perfectly fine working at Perkins and other Corporations like that.  To bail out these industries just goes to show that the abuse doesn't stop at the level of individual people.  The corporations know that they can basically become influential and then they can do whatever they want.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	How secure will we be however, when the food that we eat, the medical supplies, drugs and medications, utensils that we cook on and with, just about everything that we use to manufacture ourselves, is manufactured in foreign countries?  The military budget with all its obscene "investment" will not make us any safer when we willingly and consistently purchase the cheapest product yielding the highest profit.  The contradictions of Capitalism mean that we who are living within in a capitalist economy are always at war with ourselves.  We want the cheapest products and we are willing to pay less for them.  But, by giving up our manufacturing base we make ourselves vulnerable.  As our jobs leave and more people enter dead-end retail jobs (selling goods made elsewhere) our job security, salaries and wages are knocked lower.  We then find ourselves economizing by buying our products in Wal*Mart and dollar stores where very little is U.S. made.  The race to the bottom continues.<br>  <br>  The system is working just exactly as those in control of the nation right now wish it to be working, with the most dominant, ruthless corporations in the world....still making the most money in the most destabilizing and environmentally devastating manner possible, while poor uneducated kids die like chattel in unwinnable wars trying to secure a tiny bit more of the source of their profit.<br>  <br>  And somewhere in between, the nation's overall health and well-being are sacrificed like dazed lambs to an ignorant god, with our government offering up only the most meager, desultory efforts to keep it functional so as to not induce all-out fire-and-pitchfork revolt.|`|45azZvL9aa	Think of it like this.<br>  <br>  If you owe money on a car, home, or credit card, the banks expect you to pay back your debts.<br>  <br>  When the banks are in debt, they go to the govt, and have the govt force you to pay their debts via taxation and inflation.<br>  <br>  This whole country has gone to the toilet.

QZicQ0kuaa	It's awful how the media ignored the Democrats role in the economic meltdown, and the voters have basically voted themselves the treasury. Anyone who owns a business or has 2 workers in the household will get the bill. They don't care. They just want more for themselves. I witnessed a kid working at the grocery store ringing his teacher out. The kid was praising Obama and the Teacher was "so proud" of him. My god. That Teacher collects a government check and pension and her union keeps going to court for more. The taxpayer is getting crushed by these people and they are brainwashing for their own interests. $18,000 per pupil in upstate NY because the union takes 90%. It's a fact that Liberals cannot defend, so they just pretend it's not there.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	No, I don't believe the media elected Obama.  He performed better for the media than Sarah Palin did.  The media didn't cause her to falter when she was presented with questions.  The media wasn't responsible for McCain's team not fully vetting her before putting her up there.  I don't necessarily believe that she lacks substance altogether, and I do believe she has done very well for the state of AK.  It wasn't her time.  McCain took a gamble in trying to combat a "hollywood" image with a "hometown America" image.  He lost the gamble.<br>  <br>  Edit - I'd like to present a challenge to anyone who believes that the media is the sole reason for Sarah Palin's PR problems.  Just for a second, imagine that McCain had selected Condoleezza Rice as his running mate.  Think about how she would have held up to media pressure vs. Sarah Palin.  Then tell me that Sarah Palin was ready for the national stage.|`|AA11503457	The media campaigned for Obama and McCain in the primaries, then turned on McCain in the general elections.  Note the hissy fit they collectively had when Hillary started winning primaries after they'd waited so long to coronate Obama.  They absolutely hated Palin and went after her big time.  This could have been neutralized by the mccain campaign allowing her to go out to more live audiences, but they proved to be very inept in many ways.<br>  <br>  The scary thing is that the media can operate so blatantly and most americans don't even realize how badly they're being manipulated.|`|AA10733606	There is absolutely no question about that. <br>  I was saying this long before the election was over.|`|R7Hexutqaa	No.  66,882,230 people elected Obama. (53% of voters)  For someone who says they love America as much as you do, you certainly don't have much faith in America.<br>  <br>   I think that substantially more than 58,343,671 people would have voted for McCain had he not chosen Mrs Palin for a running mate.  She was a poor choice by him and for the country.  Not that Mrs. Palin is not smart, hard working and ambitious - but a few years of Alaska Politics and a quite parochial view of the world had her unprepared for the national political stage.  I am sure she knew that but her ambition got the best of her.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	Pretty much yeah. Those who claim that Palin did herself in because she couldnt answer any questions clearly never saw her answer any questions. Rather, they hear their fellow liberals claim that Palin couldnt answer any questions, assume its true, and regurgitate it without having seen it for themselves. <br>  <br>  The one who claimed that Palin didnt know what the bush doctrine was is a classic example of that. Palin gave an interview to Charlie Gibson. Gibson asked her if she agreed with the bush doctrine. Because there are so many definitions of what the Bush Doctrine is, she asked him to clarify and tell her which one he meant. And it was Gibson that couldnt tell her what he meant by the bush doctrine!<br>  <br>  Yet in liberal circles this got twisted into: "Palin doesnt know what the bush doctrine is". And that falsehood makes its rounds from clueless liberal to clueless liberal.|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	Nope.  "The media" does not have a vote.  Sarah made herself a target by not being able to answer the simplest of questions.  Truly, this is Bush's fault as well for doing such a terrible job as the GOP who nominated a guy who can't even operate a computer.  The GOP would do well to look in the mirror and examine it's own party and why they lost instead of blaming others and blaming the loss on things outside of their control.|`|nkh3gyr8aa	Yes, but I wouldn't have expected anything else.|`|C2HHfun2aa	No question about it!

The contrast between the way they treated Obama and the way they treated Palin shows that real journalism has died. <br>  <br>  They ignored or excused all of Obama's extremist associations and covered up his and Michelle's gaffes. It was, as Bernie Goldberg called it, a slobbering love affair. In Sarah Palin's case they reported false rumors, magnified any fault, and didn't seem to care whether they were reporting what she said or what Tina Fey said.|`|5Mfu8lEVaa	No.  I don't.

It's not like we are going to owe anything on our taxes, and if we do...it's going to be like $100 at the very most. Where is the money coming from??? That's a lot of money to just give to someone!

6IXrgxqSaa	Good question. Its because he needs to find a way to make it appear to Americans and the world that he has everything under control.  Leaders, economists, bankers of countries around the world see that there is a problem with the trust between people and a mutual effort is necessary to make progress but they don't have a way to realize it being that everyone is only concerned for self benefit. So they themselves are in fear of not knowing how to get out of this mess, not to mention there old egoistic ways and systems that worked to benefit themselves are gradually falling apart in a big way. <br>  <br>  So they come up with many ways to so to speak stick their heads in the sand and hope it just goes away. He like many leaders think that pumping many into the economy will fix this crisis. Until we uncover the true reason behind the global crisis and find a method to correct to it the situation will only escalate. People - especially the "leaders" - must realize that there is no way back to the old rules. Maybe if leaders like Obama understood the reason behind the global crisis they could start a global reconstruction of people’s perception of the world.<br>  <br>  The situation in the world can only be improved by studying the essence of the global world and educating all of humanity about a new attitude to the world - the world as one whole. If we create a system of global education about the global world, then the whole world will immediately feel that it is congruent to Nature and everyone’s hopes will come true! And we shouldn't wait for the "leaders" to make any changes, all of humanity should look to start this change now.<br>  <br>  Check out the videos, they shed more light on what I'm saying.

They are the only religion that in today's world that uses a suicide bomber as a weapon.

This went on for 8 long years before Israel took action.  Yet Israel was made to look like the evil monster in the war.  Yet in a city of 1.5 million people less than 4,000 people were injured and less than 1,500 people died.  The war lasted for 3 weeks  Israel was not trying to murder Palestinians They were trying to get the Hamas Leadership and to stop the countless rocket attacks.  After this war Hamas claimed they won.  I wonder why they had the nerve?

The 'deficit' only looks at whether the BUDGET is greater than income, not at the increase in the national debt, which will continue to increase at an unprecedented rate.<br>  <br>  Smoke and mirrors.|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	Now is not a good time to mention deficit spending if you are a Dem.

Thanks Democrats we are now owned by china. Hilary now has the job of prying their hands open for more. But let's get real. every president has run into money problems but have always managed to keep the country pretty well calm and things didn't get too bad until now. We need at this time a president with some knowledge of how to get us back to a somewhat live able budget but Obama is entirely taken us too far down. There a few jobs. factories are closing and some even moving out of the country. People are losing their homes and the so called help he is putting out there have so many strings attached that the owners are getting twisted in the strings. They can't sell cuz the price has gone too low. They or most have lost jobs so they can't make their payments so the only ones that benefit are the wealthy who buys them up with their pocket change.So mind your tongue about the republicans and see what the democrats are doing to us.and what bu git are you talking about of Obamas' I see no budget.

But then as I read the details it got a little crazy.<br>  The bible DOES say that blacks are an inferior race and should be kept separate from whites. Which is why there was slavery, because of the christian bible.<br>  And the government is becoming more christian day by day. So it's possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  But I think there should be a 1-child limit for EVERYONE.  I'm SICK and TIRED of working MY @ss off to make ends meet so I can put more money towards taxes to pay for some hooker like Nadya Suleman, and people who have 8 kids with 8 different guys and they don't work and use the state money that's supposed to feed their kids, but they spend it on hair and nails for themselves as their kids starve to death in the basement (like on that episode of CSI with that black lady buying a big screen tv and taking care of herself and starving her sister's kids to death).<br>  <br>  <br>  But yes, white people are the minority these days.  Because you are more financially safe as a black person, than a white person, and where I'm living now, all the black people keep sleeping together and are on state funding with a bunch of kids and no jobs.<br>  But then again there were a lot of white girls knocked up by black guys who they didn't know, and had to drop out of school before they graduated, at my school.

And when they search,they don't just open your drawers and look in them, They rip your house to shreds! It will look like a tornado has gone thru.

The search would have to be limited to areas where that evidence could be found.  <br>  <br>  If there was a search that exceeded the boundaries that the law allowed, the evidence could still be used - generally, search&seizure law is meant to protect people from evidence obtained in vilation of their rights - that means it could still be used against him.  If the evidence was found on his person after a search of your home, they evidence could not really be barred against you, since you don;t have an expectation of privacy in somebody else's pockets (though the practical value of that evidence in an ultimate trial against you would be limited).<br>  <br>  "I feel that he has really changed his ways"<br>  and the arguments that a prosecutor would use against that are:<br>  1) the law doesn't care about what you feel<br>  2) you're just covering up because you know he hasn't changed, and you are exploiting that to reap the benefits of his crimes.<br>  <br>  "My Friend is not a bad person."<br>  The law doesn't care if you're a good or bad person, only if you have done good or bad things.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	You better believe you'd be in trouble - it's called "guilty by association" and in some instances, you could lose your house.

You use the word racism as though you think we keep forgetting the topic. 4 times in 4 1/2 lines is excessive. Maybe one line could be "and IT still exsists today", remember, we know what you are talking about. I would take the second "racist" out too, but instead of saying "it", look up a synonym for the word. <br>  <br>  I do not know how long this is supposed to be. But come off as though I, the reader, has no idea this happened. OK, why was it hard for them? How did it happen? Why isn't racism this strong anymore? And how can you really back up that point? Answer a few questions for the reader.|`|oB8bbiwWaa	I think your definition of racism needs work - racism does not simply mean hatred or intolerance, it can also mean the subjugation of another race - arguably different than hatred or intolerance.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, instead of saying "there was a lot of racism all over the US back then,"  I would say that "racism was the accepted norm in the 19th century.  In the 20th century, although strides toward tolerance had been made, racism continued to pervade in all corners of the United States."|`|sjB8eFWgaa	Affirmative action and liberalism have created and reinforced perceptions of victimization, satisfying infantile claims to entitlement, indulgence and compensation, and augmenting primitive feelings of envy.<br>  The 19th century was a difficult time for all Americans. We have come a long way today because most people of all races have overcome the hatred and intolerance and joined the great melting pot that is America's trademark.|`|jVUEohsNaa	Blacks don't want to let racism go.  It is a great excuse to keep failing.
AA11163314	Do you understand that 'real life' spies are not anything like the ones in those movies?|`|939486fd47e1ca3cefbbae1d7440046daa	Go to their website see what they require.

6Fsliwlhaa	If your drug charges include trafficking or distribution (selling drugs) then you are permanently disqualified and you cannot get a waiver.  Also, documented chronic use will disqualify you.  If it is simply possession or recreational (not chronic) use then you can get a waiver but you probably won't be able to get a security clearance.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	I hope not|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Yep. My ex had a drug charge against him (marijuana). He had to get a waiver and was denied high level security positions. He's now enlisted as a cook.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	...and it's going to be a lot harder to get a moral waiver in this favorable recruiting climate.|`|9d9b8b9e4972c1f3e7d9b9e80936b200aa	you'll have to get waivers and it will affect your ability to get security clearances|`|AA10037740	Infantry
AA11206283	Yes; 3 different formats <br>  <br>  PDF:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flcourts.org/gen_public/family/forms_rules/901b3.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.flcourts.org/gen_public/famil...</a>|`|B4O3f8w6aa	You can get the forms at the courthouse. You then fill them out and pay a fee (used to be $65) and appear before a judge in a couple weeks. Property can be included in the dissolution papers. A Dissolution is merely an uncontested divorce wherein, each party agrees to all the terms in the agreement. Be advised when Credit card debt is included, that was signed for by both parties, that the card companies will go after both parties for non-payment even though the agreement clearly states who agreed to pay the debt.

He can try but he'll more than likely lose. CT has signs posted up and down the interstate system warning people NOT to travel in the lanes.|`|Ar7swtCPaa	Fast lane is better known as the "passing lane " anywhere you go and technically  you are not supposed to sit there. If he fights it that would be stupid as he was the one with drugs on him at the time and got away with just a ticket. Tell him suck it up pay the fine and stay out of the passing lane|`|q8vILEpfaa	Was it the outside lane if the interstate? Was it the hov lane in the city?  The officer had a reason to stop you I'm sorry your friend.<br>  <br>  If the whole thing sounds bogus why did he let your friend off without a possession charge?<br>  If pot was in the center console then it was in plain sight. He could have brought in the dogs and tore the car apart if he wanted to.<br>  Let it go, the policeman did someone a real big favor letting them go.<br>  <br>  Obey the laws and you have nothing to explain to the insurance company.
AA10118655	What type of "legal control" are you talking about? Are you talking about making legal decisions on your behalf (like medical or financial)? Or are you talking about being involved in government decisions?<br>  <br>  If the first, then only if you want them to and you voluntarily give them POA. If the second, then no.|`|VOccyg7daa	what in the HELL are you talking about? Churches have no legal control over anyone. And what the HELL is wrong with your keyboard try to stay off of the caps button. <br>  <br>  I have no idea where you are going to get any info on this topic.|`|5Mfu8lEVaa	I'm not sure what you're talking about.  You seem to be asking if church leaders should make rule for non believers...the short answer is NO.  We have a secular government.|`|LxrsG8ifaa	That is an interesting question. I would look into the case of Ted Haggard if you need info for a paper.
A9vvZ6eUaa	OK, it may be legit, however it is not respected. Your criminal justice classes will not be as respected as someone who attends those classes from a University.   Anyways, what is the highest degree you can earn from Everest? An associates?  An associates is worthless. I suggest you drop Everest and enroll in a college or university so you can earn a degree that is respected. Everest is viewed as a "crappy" school that accepts all people regardless of their credentials.  Those criminal justice classes at Everest will be worthless and achieve nothing, i suggest you upgrade to a respected university.
b8uYVhVMaa	Nope...|`|nyqIGYSlaa	If discipline is an option you are entitled to all the information the manager will rely upon when reaching the decision in the case. They are also legally obliged to put the charges in writing to you and give you adequate time to prepare your defense. So the answer is yes where discipline is an possible outcome of the complaint.<br>  <br>  However if a complaint has been made and the manager is merely investigating the complaint to decide if you may face disciplinary charges then they are not obliged to inform you on the detail of the complaint or the complainer. <br>  <br>  So in short. If following, the investigation, the manager decides the matter will go no further then you may never know who the complainant was. But if the investigation results in a formal disciplinary hearing then you are entitled to know the complaint and the complainant.|`|uomsNfxzaa	Not if they ask for it to be in confidence but the employer MUST give you reasons and evidence of why they are terminating your job, unless you committed a platen offence in the work place and then it would be better if you just resign. If you were to take your employer to court over it the person or witness or whatever would have to give evidence.They could be hidden behind a screen but it is very likely you will find out who it is.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Not if they have asked for it to be in confidence.  Some people are scared about coming forward and making complaints so this makes it easier for them
caLPjFI7aa	no she still has to pay you back the money she owes you from back rent that she owes plus what she stole from you.  You did the right thing on changing the locks because you have proof that she stole from you it was your personal right to keep precaution from her stealing again from you or the other person living with you.  You can file a court order for her to pay everything back since she did live there. Its no matter here or there that she was on the lease she was there using your electric, water, food, and also the child was there living there.  It wasnt your fault she got kicked out it was her own.  Your better interest to get the legal court into this and cut the middle man out because soon as that comes to fruition she will be forced to pay what she owes from the loss and money she owes for staying there to pay for the portion of the bills
3WYcPsm4aa	Nope!  There are no copies of it kept anywhere.  <br>  <br>  Best bet.... IRS form 2848, IRS POA.  He can pull it up on the computer system in Iraq, print it out, sign it and mail it off to you.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are filing electronically, you do not need a POA.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	That'll be hard but your husband should be able to get another from his JAG office.  You can't get one since HE has to give YOU power of attorney.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	JAG does NOT keep copies of POA's. You will need to contact your DH and have him go to legal there and request another one for you. There maybe even a way for him to send it to you priority mail. We have some friends who had to do finance paperwork for a car (it was an emergency theirs literally died and they had 5 kids all under 10) She had the paperwork to him in less than 3 days and he had it back to her in less than 5 days which at that time was record speeds for from the states to Iraq and back again.<br>  <br>  Another option is places like taxact.com or taxslayer.com and any other online submission of taxes. What happens is you enter a PIN which serves as a digital signature instead of a actual on paper signature. It's faster, greener and actually less theft resistant. You can print out the return so he can see them and even email him copies of them after you've filed (that's what we do) We do direct deposit and haven't paid to do our taxes in like 6 years now. We get our refund in about 2 weeks and are done with it.  I had ours filed (for 08) on the 8th of Feb and they where just waiting for the IRS to open up the accepting of filings on the 19th.  (no BS I'm serious.) It is SO much easier then going somewhere and filing.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	You can't get a copy from JAG.  If you lost the original then your husband will have to send you another copy from Iraq.  There are JAG representatives over there but until you get the POA in the mail from him you have an automatic extension on your taxes until he gets back from deployment.|`|3380c837a43038d78b48114287ccf919aa	He needs to get another one from his local JAG office and then mail it to you. A copy won't do. You need an original from him (stamped by the JAG lawyer/notary).|`|AA10037740	Easy, Just go to the JAG office.
