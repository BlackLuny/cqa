20090205191604AApDudJ	Pets;Dogs	Should my dog be taken to the vet?	My Chi that was born on Christmas Eve 08. has diarrhea. This morning, he elimated and everything was normal, except that i could totally smell it and thats how i knew he eliminated. When I got home from school about 6 hours later, he eliminated but it was extremely watery and brown. Although he plays around with us and runs everywhere, at the same time, he seems to be more tired. He also dosent seem to be eating very much. Does he have worms or what? He also looks skinnier but my family thinks its normal because he is a chi and runs around alot. He is only two pounds at this moment? Help

20090205191927AA0p2Ug	Pets;Cats	Can anyone tell me about aging cats.?	I have a 14 yr old american long hair maine coon male cat. When he was young he was the "cock of the walk" I had him neutered late, at the age of 9, after he returned after a three year hiatus somewhere. I   noticed after that he didn't want to go out much at all and I thought he   might be embarrased because he was neutered. When he did go out   it would be at 3 or 4 in the morning so that his buddies wouldn't see him and he would come right back in. Now we live on the first floor and   in the summer he will come out in the yard with me and lay in the sun   but in the winter he barely sticks his nose out the door. I realize he is getting old and I am sure his three years on the street certianly aged   him alot. Whta i am most concerned about is that he is so thin. I can't    seem to put weight on him and he wants to eat all the time. He has been wormed. I feed him Purina One cat food and I always have and   now he has been wet food added to it. He eats several times a day. Is this normal?

20090205192452AAw6EbM	Pets;Rodents	Yet another guinea pig question?	Ok so I have three small females (8 - 10 weeks old) in a cage together and a 5 month old male in a separate cage. I thought he was getting lonely so I got all the pigs out to run around together but kept a watchful eye on the male to make sure he wouldn't mount any of the females.       He kept after the eldest of the female, sniffing and licking her rear end until she had had enough and bit and sprayed white stuff everywhere! Then one on the females sniffed her rear and she sprayed her too. What does this mean and what on earth is the white stuff?       She got it on me so I showered straight away lol, might give the pigs a bath later too. So gross.

20090205193125AAKGiAt	Pets;Horses	Dis hores confirmation? Just kidding I couldn't resist - This horses conformation?	I have heard that a draft x thoroughbred crosses make good jumpers because they have the stamina/agility of the thoroughbreds but the strong legs and strength of the draft parent as well. I have also heard that sometimes the draft parents heavy weight is passed on and the horse is too heavy to make it in higher jumping, because it would be hard on their joints and tendons.      I found this horse that is a thoroughbred - shire cross, 5yrs old, 16.2hh, and I was wondering if anyone thought he looked compact and not too heavy for jumping? I know it is an odd cross, and he is a PMU born horse if that makes a difference. Any other thoughts/comments about him that you guys think I need to know? Thanks.

So i posted a question on here and people said to try sticky paws. Well I put that on the couch where he tends to scratch. And instead of scratching it he pulled it off with his teeth and started to play with it. So instead of scratch marks in my couch I now have bite marks. What to do? Is there a safe spray that I can buy to spray on the couch to keep him completely off of it. The kitten and him play on the couch like it is a jungle gym. It is driving me mad!
20090205160626AAIvgJ0	Pets;Cats	I love my kitten but...why?	I have a young kitten who's truly a lap cat. She will follow me around the house, she sits on my lap when i watch tv and if I should ever be so mean as to leave her in the house while I go out she mews, meows and generally raises hell.       Now I love her to death and none of these things are the problem-actually there is no problem- I'm just confused. I understand that as I bottle fed her she thinks I'm her mother and therefor has bonded quite strongly to me. I love her too.       The thing I'm confused about is this-She will only sleep on me or on me pillow. She has a very nice soft bed and a very comfy cat house so I'm not sure why she cant sleep next to my bed in one of those.       Is there any way I can make her bed or her cat house a little more appealing so I can have my own bed again?

20090205175807AAfNOCi	Pets;Dogs	Strange cut with hair loss on dog? Mange?	I have a year old pitt bull german shepherd cross and this morning I discovered a patch near her left ear. All of the hair on the patch is gone, and there is a red scratch or stripe underneath, there is also like wet gooeyness on top of it. There doesn't look to be any blood. There is a possibility that she got her head stuck in a hole in the fence, but then I would have thought there would be blood. We live in a suburban area and she isn't in contact with other dogs regularly. She has little patches of no hair on her feet that have been there for ages, but we assume those have come from little fights with our other dog, who is fine with no mange.

20090205181434AA21ye4	Pets;Horses	Can a half blind horse learn to jump?	I have a 5 year old Arabian Gelding. He's almost blind in his right eye, he can still see shadows which scares the crap out of him. He's NOT broke yet, but I been lunging him on a lunge line.

20090205181802AAMqUxe	Pets;Cats	Is my cat pregnant? And is she safe?	I have a kitten who was born in May of 08. She went into heat three days ago and I saw her repeatedly mate with my unneutered cat. (I know, I have to get them fixed! I didn't expect her to go into heat because she was so small, and because we were in the heart of winter. I didn't know cats went into heat this time of year). Anyway, she no longer is in heat, but I have no clue if shes pregnant. I want to bring her to get spayed, but if shes pregnant, that might not be a good idea. Is there anyway I can find out if she's pregnant? I need to know ASAP!!! Also, is she old enough and experienced enough to raise her own litter? She is the greatest little kitty and I would hate to see her and her offspring vanish due to my carelessness.          Thanks for your understanding and help through this miraculous and scary time for me and my little Suki! =)      Gary

20090205200344AAyieXy	Pets;Other - Pets	How to convince my dad to let me adopt Guinea Pigs?	WARNING: THIS IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY LONG!!!      I wrote a 7-page report on them, I've been researching them for months, I got a book on them, I know practically everything about them. He's sort of convinced, but not really. Yet.   He says that I have to do what I'm doing and take responsibility for a while until he thinks I can adopt some. It's tougher than you think.      By taking responsibility (he said this because he KNOWS it's hard and boring,) he means, "Keep your room clean, then when your autistic sister messes it up all over again, WITHOUT SCREAMING OR TELLING HER TO STOP, say that it's your fault and clean it up again." Seriously, I asked him, that's what he said.      I love my sister, but she can be part of the problem more than ever sometimes! (She has BAD autism... D*=)  I like to keep my room clean, 24/7.. Trouble is, my room is also her play room. Literally. So whenever I wake up, I hide everything that's important to me that I don't want her to break under my bed. (she likes to break those, and mess up my bed more than ever! It's hard to not scream. =/)   Whenever I ask her to get out, they yell at me and say, "take responsibility... Remember, Guinea Pigs!!!"   I've been doing this for a month, OH WAIT! I forgot to mention, I'm home schooled, so schoolwork takes 10 minutes! I got straight A's on my last report card (and yet I'm 2-3 grades ahead of what I'm supposed to be... o.O) and I keep-KEPT my room clean. Ever since I made it look pretty, my sister wrecks it because she PROBABLY thinks it's "Magical"...   ... I have this sort of way of knowing. When I was 6 years old, I would go into a very pretty room (my parents LOL) and think, "oooh, a magic room!!! It's so pretty, OOH A BOUNCY THING!!! *jumps on it* oohh this is fun! *messes it all up*" and then the next day it turned clean again for me to mess up again, so I don't blame her for doing so. But that's getting off topic lol!      ALRIGHT... The main thing is, after all that nonsense up above (I have a tendency to write things that people don't even have to know about first and put the main thing afterwards, sorry!) My dad wants me to take responsibility, keep my room clean, go to my classes on time, do my piano, and do my schoolwork. He also wants to know that he won't take care of the guinea pigs (he killed the freakin' last 7 fish in under a year!) because he sucks at that sort of thing. I tried to convince him I would (I WOULD. Giving a guinea pig to him would be animal cruelty, really... x_X) but he still thinks I should keep on doing what I'm doing. Grr.      I've been doing all this, boring, hard, impatient things for a while now, and yet... "Dad, look. *points to another report, and shows her weekly data of responsibility*"... Dad: "Oh, yeah. Keep it up. *gets back to his politic channel*" x_X      I really want to STOP doing this responsibility thing, because I KNOW I'm responsible. I keep my room now very clean (even with my sister... Hiding my important stuff really works.) and do all my schoolwork after breakfast, and then do 5 hardcore hours of research on guinea pig even when I know everything!      Oh and I'm 11.   LOL! Okay, I seem a little irresponsible while I'm typing, I'm sure. But really, I am responsible. I'm trying to prove it to him but it's all gone wrong. Help?    (P.S... Thanks for reading all this, I appreciate it. I would just probably skip the intro, middle, and read the ending part and answer the question down there :))
20090205200347AAYBrnS	Pets;Reptiles	What should i do if my baby red-eared slider is blind?!?	Ok for like 2 or 3 days my baby red-eared slider hasn't been opening her eyes at all! she moves sometimes but when she does she looks like she doesn't even know where she's going. if i put her in the water she doesn't move or crawl on top of her rock.someone has to be there to put her on her rock. i'm really really really worried about her! i think her eyes are swollen and she's blind because when her eyes are closed they look really big for some reason and they didn't used to be like that. Ever since i got her which is last week, she hasn't ate one single thing! i have no idea why. i've been trying to feed her every healthy thing a red-eared slider eats but she doesn't even touch her food! i'm really worried and scared and i don't know what to do. i don't want her to die. somebody please help me.....
20090205190613AAK4jCs	Pets;Reptiles	Why is my hermit crab out of his shell?	I know that they do come out if they're going to molt.  But I'm worried that there may be another reason that he's out of his shell.  I know that they needed water (I've been sick and I neglected them for a few days).  I feel so terrible.  I think he may have come out because of that.  He's not too big for his shell. At least not if what I read is true that as long as the opening is bigger than their big claw, it's fine.  And he didn't bury himself, like I thought they were supposed to do if they molt.  So is there any other reason for him coming out of his shell?  I'm just scared that he got too dry and I don't want him to die...

20090205185323AA86mnM	Pets;Rodents	One of my rats has broken his leg... I need some suggestions.?	Hello, I've had my rat Dude for over a year now. I have 3 others, however I ended up having to keep Dude by himself as he just DIDN'T get on with the other boys.      Today I noticed he wasn't coming out his cage. This is fairly normal, he sometimes just wants his own space.      Tonight, I got him a treat to get him to come out, and I noticed he was limping badly on his back leg, and then noticed his leg was awfully swollen.      What I want to ask is,       a) How to make him more comfortable while I'm waiting to get him to the vets.      b) He's fairly old. He's probably around two. He's had breathing problems for a long time, and medication most of the time doesn't seem to help him.      c) Would it be fairest, with his other health problems, to have him laid to rest? He's had a good life.. I just hate to think it's going to end with a broken leg :(      Thanks

Well today, in the morning, her back legs were in the water bowl, so I moved her because I didn't want her to drown. I came home, and she was in the same position. I took the lid off, which usually freaks her out, and I tried to pick her up, but she didn't move. I misted her with water, because I thought she was dehydrated. I just got back from my class, and she still isn't moving, and when I touched her, fur was coming off. Please only answer if you are an experience tarantula owner. By the way, it's a Chilean Rose. She wasn't in a curled up position, like people are telling me spiders look when they die. What could be the cause of her death?

I went to petco today and got him some minnows and he has no interest in them.    He looks healthy still. Nothing on his eyes. Skin is shedding some and he has lost some scales from his shell. He acts like he is hungry, but doesnt eat when food is given to him      Any ideas on what could be wrong with him? I plan on taking him to the vet in a few days if the minnows are still there.

I met a lady at the vet yesterday who was needing help finanially with her dog...my dad was gunna help her...i met her on craigslist...she told me the dog had trouble walking.      Well they had to carry the rottie in on a blanket and the dog had no muscle on him, could not stand was severely dehydrated, no control of bladder etc...the vet examined him and pinched btw his toes with clamps w/ no reaction...he said back injury that went on too long and he said he would not waste our money to run any tests or hospitalize as there was NO HOPE!  He had them pick the dog up and his back legs just hung.      I offered for us to pay to euthanize the dog and they refused and carried him back out to the car..he only moved his head once the hour in the vet and you could hear him breathing in the hall way.    Well they decided not to euthanize and I along with the vet and vet tech were shocked.  They said the dog must be in pain...      This bothered me more than I imagined something like this would...shouldnt there be a way to "make people" end a dogs suffering?

Hence the name, Quarter horse.) Anyway, he nearly ran over 10 little kids on horses, because he was running SIDEWAYS across the ring, and i had to turn him towards the wall to ge him to stop, and he was going so fast, and stopped so suddenly, went flying over his head, and landed in the soft, cusiony, velvet bleachers.(thank goodness they're made of velvet, and not steel!) So, i had an exciting night. does you're horse spook? were you ever on a horse that spooked? What happened?       Also, is there any othe way to get him to stop when he spooks? besides a pelham, that's too severe for him, and the only time, i used it, and the last time, it made him so grumpy, i got down to take it off, but it looked like he was bleeding. i sat deep in the saddle, did quick pull and releases, said "Whoa, and halt!"  but i still ended up steering him into the wall as my last resort.... help?

20090203065451AATzhNq	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my dog to stop eating lint?	He has a habit of finding lint balls and dust bunnies everywhere. I clean and clean and clean, but he still finds them. I've told him no dozens of times, take it out of his mouth, and give him a treat instead...but I still know that he eats this stuff because he will suddenly hack up lint balls at times. I think some of it might be coming from his stuffed animals that I bought him, because some of it is green lint and he has a frog that I bought him. He will find this crap everywhere though. How do I stop him? I'm afraid he might really choke bad sometime.

Hi, I bought a 6 week old pet rat last week from the pet shop (please don't message about bad quality rats from pet shops, i've heard it all before) & she has either myco or a respiratory infection. I took her to the vets last friday & was prescribed baytril 2.5% on a 0.7 dosage. I've been giving her it once a day since then and she doesn't seem to be getting any better, one day she seems to be breathing a bit better but she still has the sneezes but then today shes started breathing funny again. How long does baytril usually take to work, because from past experience the illness had started to clear up within a week. How long should I wait till I take her back to the vets, should I give the antibiotic more time?

I do have live plants in there but they are floating on top (Java fern or moss). originally I thought this was okay but now I see he needs plants actually in the tank he can rest on and swim through and play in. Oh and I do have some fake flowers that he used to rest in but he doesn't any more. I do have a filter and heater in his tank. So what do YOU suggest I put into his tank?

20090205202739AAbzyeA	Pets;Other - Pets	How to show I am responsible for a pet?	I'm going to try to adopt Guinea Pigs  from some rescue centers, my dad's not so keen on it yet because he doesn't think I am responsible.   I have researched them for MONTHS, so I DO know practically about everything about guinea pigs. Seriously!  I even wrote a 7 page report :P      So he wants me to keep on doing what I'm doing, but more... responsibly (lol)..   Like, keep my room clean (No problem if my sis doesn't get in there!), do my schoolwork on time (I do that, and I get straight A's.), and be nice to "mommy". :)    Oh, and I"m 11 AND Home schooled so I can take care of them any time. Even when I'm doing home work ^.^   His 3 big worries are:      1. My autistic sister (she likes to squeeze things to death... So you get the picture. Though of course, I already have a solution. A lock on the cage.:))   2. I'm not responsible yet (But I KNOW I am! :D)   3. He doesn't want to take care of them after 4 weeks of owning them. (What? No way! He killed the last 7 fish in less than a year! Giving any pet to him would be fatal! x_X)      So I need help on 2# and 3#. How can I show I'm responsible, and how can I convince him that HE won't take care of it?    I know, "Chores. Don't talk back. Do extra chores (he told me not to do anything more than what I'm doing now, so I'm suspecting that's good.)," I'm doing that, and sadly, no effect yet. Though he gave me a suggestion for trying, "Oooh, why don't you make an animation called, "The Chronicles of trying to convince your "evil dad parent who keeps on saying no" to get you guinea pigs"!" LOL.. Actually I'm making one right now... lol      But still, seriously. I thrive on guinea pigs. I spend at least 3 hours a day on the computer for them (researching, watching youtube guinea pig stuff.. etc..)      ANY WAY AT ALL? And is there a way to let my sister in some of this? Since she has BAD autism, she can't touch an animal without scaring it... No offense to her, but it's true :( I want to know if I can help her communicate with guinea pigs?      Thanks so much.  If you don't know what I just asked of you, here's the summary.   How can I show my dad that I'm responsible enough for guinea pigs, I'm home schooled, he's worried that he'll take care of them after 4 weeks, I do chores and excellent schoolwork, but he still says "not yet." And how can I involve my sister into this?      Thanks for reading this heap of junk!

Has anyone used cyclosporine .02 ointment without success for canine dry eye, then had better results using the tacrolimus .02 ointment?   I've also used cyclosporine 2.0 drops but the dog didn't seem to tolerate it well (yellowish eye formation after 3 days)   I'm really hoping this works because surgery is the only next option. The dog is a small Chinese Crested and dry eye seems to be common in this breed. The last shirmer tear test was yesterday, readings were 1, and 2 in the good eye, not good from 6 a few months ago.

20090205204336AARqHnT	Pets;Cats	Cat training question - unusual situation...?	I have a cat with three legs. Her front left is missing. The vet can't tell when she lost her leg (I got her from the pound that way). I think she lost it when she was a young adult because she "tries" to use the leg that isn't there. When she's in the litter box she tries to cover her poo with the leg that isn't there. How can I teach her to use her good leg to cover it?     a bit more info...    Her balance is great - I'm sure she is physically capable of this based on what I've seen her do. She chases (and catches) cat toys with the one front paw, for example.    Serious answers only please. I'm looking for specific techniques. Dogs are easy to train. Cats? They don't care if they make you happy... after all, aren't we there to make THEM happy? :-)    Anyway, if anyone has a training idea that might work, please let me know.

I'd be keeping my pet in my hood on my coat, or one of my pockets on my coat. I was thinking maybe a ferret would do the trick. I don't trust birds really, and I'm not too sure about reptiles. A chihuahua probably won't like living in a pocket. A monkey would be neat, but... they're illegal I hear. Please refrain from smartass comments, I understand this is a living creature and not a tool to show off with. I'm always on the run and I'd like a pet I could keep with me. A pet rock or Chia Pet just won't do. Rats and mice are very neat, but unclean, in the sense that I've never been able to train one to not crap in my pocket. Any suggestions? Does God make these sorts of pets of which I seek?

20090205214137AAlDP65	Pets;Fish	Would my fry be okay??? Please answer!!!?	Okay my female guppy is about to have her fry sometime very soon.. I have 2 guppies one  male and one female, neon tetras, glo fish, cory cat, a pleco and ghost shrimp in a tank will they be eaten if I don't put them in the other tank? I wont use a breeder thing that goes at the top of the tank because in the past I have never been able to keep them in it and I have no clue on how they escape.      If I put them in the fry tank that I have set up can I leave the pleco in there? I have him in there right now so that he can give the tank a good cleaning before they come.      Please answer I will pick the best answer myself.. It's an easy 10pts.      NOTE: All of my fish besides the pleco are maybe an inch big if that helps the answer at all.

20090205212447AAdYwwq	Pets;Other - Pets	Respiratory Infections with rats and Home-made litter/bedding?	3 days ago we bought 2 rats from Petco. They are appx. 12 weeks old and hooded. Sister rats. We bought them and walked home with them after riding home on the city bus. Shortly after one of the girls started sneezing, I thought at first it might be form the cold weather that day but then I realized from other q's and a's that the bedding might be the problem, we made the mistake of getting  a mix of wood shavings (such as pine) Wellllllll point of the matter, I found a recipe to make my own bedding: shredded newspaper/magazines/reg paper ...warm water... eco friendly dish soap and baking soda, I a currently drying it in a pillow case in the dryer. My ULTIMATE question is, has anyone used this method, and dide it work to ease up on the sneezing. I also gave the rats some garlic cloves which they loved, because i read that it might help. Thanks!

20090205212742AABuIyg	Pets;Dogs	Is it possible some dogs simply do not like being in crates? (read fully before anwsering!)?	I've had a puppy for over two weeks now. She is about 8 weeks at this point. (Before anyone rants about how young she is, she was abandoned.) I have been putting her in a crate every night since I got her, yet she barks NONSTOP. It's to the point that I've had to put her crate in a playhouse outside to get any sleep. I've tried crating her both in a room by herself and in my room with me in sight. Sleeping with me (no crate) IS NOT option, because at her age she will make a mess everywhere and I would really perfer to crate train her.      I make sure and put plenty of bedding and chew toys with her to keep her entertained. I put a radio beside the crate but it didn't do much good.I give her treats and praise her when she goes in, yet as soon as I'm out of sight or she's in the cage for more than say 30 secs...she goes crazy. Also, I DO ignore her when she barks because I know any attention only promotes the behavior. She is out all day, and has complete roam of the house (supervised of course) so getting enough exercise or attention shouldn't be the problem either.      I'm stumped...Any suggests? Could it be that some dogs just don't like being in crates? Or is it a matter of her being so many weeks old before this behavior stops? I know dogs are supposed to bark for maybe a few minutes or even an hour or  2 when left alone at night, but this is just excessive!!!
20090205212750AAqjkQ1	Pets;Dogs	I just got bitten by a german shepard?	The dog was trained in germany and he is aggressive. He is a male about 3 years old. He comes from the same line of shep that the nyc transit cops use. Owner keeps him in a pen outside. I have been around the dog about 5 or 6 times dog in pen me outside pen. One day I visited my friend who owns dog. Dog was not in pen. I walked along side of house and the next thing I hear is my friend yell at his dog No. The dog was out of the pen and off leash. I did not move and stood perfectly still. The dog approached me showing what appeared to be a friendly greeting. He was wagging his tail. I gave him a chance to sniff me.   The dog was very curious as to why I was not showing any fear.   Then the owner came running toward the dog and when the owner got between me and the dog the dog bit me on the forearm. Luckily it was winter and I was wearing a thick carhart jacket and multiple layers underneath. He gave me one good bite and had a playful look on his face after he got me. I stayed calm and did not make any moves toward the dog. He told me to get in my car and begged me not to report the situation. The owner told me the dog is trained to kill.   This shepard could have easily went right for my throat. Thats where he is trained to target a full attack. The pressure of the bite was intense. This dog could have crushed my bones like toothpicks.   The owner was very upset and called up the people who trained him.      They said he gave me a warning bite and as long as I did not show any aggression the dog has showed his dominance.   I was then told to come back and get introduced to the dog while he was muzzled and talk nicely to the dog and show no resentment.   They said the dog will sense resentment and not trust me.   I was amazed to find out how amazingly smart the shepard is.   He told me after I was introduced as no threat to the dog that the dog would take me in as one of the pack and protect me as he does the rest of the family as long as he remained dominant.   I decided to just keep it simple. Whenever I visit the dog must be in the pen. So my question is this. This dog is trained to kill and he did not kill me, He gave me a warning bite. Does this dog have poor people skills ? Did I do the right things ? Did the owner over react   causing the dog to bite me ?

20060615170705AAIxkoe	Pets;Cats	Kitten with dislocated shoulder, could this have come from kitten jumping down from sitting in the window?	The kitten is about 5 months old. The right front leg is injured.  And the ball of the leg is now below the shoulder area. That is the shoulder is dislocated from the socket. How would you go about poping the balljoint back into the socket?  I had suggested to the people to gently locate the socket then the ball joint and try to relocate the shoulder. I suggested gentle massage to rexax the muscles in the area of the injury. They would take the kitten to a vet., but have already got a bill from having the adult cats spayed and nutered. There were four adults, and some kittens that were found homes and three kittens that had to be put to sleep for serious health problems they were born with. Can any one help on this?
