TNTFomKeaa	Yes you can. The difference is that you will be assessed on your own income rather than on your parents' income, and they will not be expected to contribute to your education. You have to be assessed as an independent student, which means that for the last three years you have been supporting yourself. You prove that using payslips or P45s. <br>  As you're a student, your personal income will likely be around zero. This means that you'll be eligible for maximum tuition fee loans, maintenance loans, grants and bursaries from the university itself. All in all, it should work out quite well for you.

Generally the University who offers this also offers a 'top-up' which you can go on to do after the FdSc to give you a BSc Hons Degree.<br>  <br>  A HND is the same in length and 'top-up' however the content will vary.  Generally you will be out in a workplace a few days a week and in Uni/College posisbly 1 or 2 days a week.<br>  <br>  Check the course contect before you make a decision, contact the Uni they should be able to provide you with the course handbook or guidance notes.|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	A foundation degree isnt really a degree. Its a year long course before an honours degree where you learn the principles of a subject. Some students find it helps in achieving more in their honour degrees. So the question is would you like to take an extra year to learn the subject in more depth, or jump straight into the degree, its up to you.

But I think it is better to remember that when you have different terms in an expression like  2x - 3y and so on, the minus sign really is part of the second term, as I said above, and it should really be written as 2x + (-3y).We are just being lazy when we write 2x - 3y, and it is this which causes the confusion when it comes to equations like the ones you have here.|`|7959WbC2aa	Sometimes the easiest way to remember how to add them together is to set them up in a long equation<br>  x+y+x-y=5+3<br>  2x=8<br>  x=4, x+y=5---> 4+y=5<br>  y=1<br>  On the second one, remember that you have to multiply both sides by the same thing<br>  x+y=5<br>  -2(x+y)=-10<br>  -2x-2y=-10 then the same as before<br>  -2x-2y+2x+y=-10+6<br>  -y=-4<br>  y=4, x+y=5----> x+4=5<br>  x=1|`|EGvTzIojaa	1. if you add 2 equations both sides then u will get<br>     X+Y+X-Y=5+3<br>  --> 2X=8<br>  --> X=4<br>  and Y=5-X from eq X+Y=5<br>  --> Y=5-4 <br>  --> Y=1<br>  <br>  2. for this if u substract eq X+Y=5 from 2X+Y=6 then u will get<br>    2X+Y-X-Y=6-5<br>  --> X=1<br>   then<br>     from eq X+Y=5<br>    Y=5-X <br>  --> Y=5-1<br>   -> Y=4|`|HpAlzgERaa	x + y = 5 , x - y = 3 . then x=4 , y=1.<br>  x=5-y , -> x -5 + x = 3 -> 2x=8 -> x = 4 . ... . y =5-4 = 1<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  2) <br>  x= 5-y<br>  2x - (5-x) =6 ->  2x - 5 + x = 6<br>  3x = 11 -> x =11/3 => 3.6<br>  y =5-3.6 => y =1.4

dnl66ZXTaa	A main clause—sometimes called an independent clause—must contain a subject and a verb as well as express a complete thought. Look at the examples below:<br>  <br>  Diane kicked the soda machine.<br>  <br>  Diane = the subject; kicked = the verb.<br>  <br>  A giant spider has made its home behind the shampoo bottle in Neil's bathroom.<br>  <br>  Spider = the subject; has made = the verb.<br>  <br>  Sima and Michele are skipping their chemistry class to sit by the lake and watch the sun sparkle on the water.<br>  <br>  Sima, Michele = the subjects; are skipping = the verb.<br>  <br>  When you place a subordinate conjunction in front of a subject and verb, you will no longer have a complete thought. The group of words becomes a subordinate clause, like these examples:<br>  <br>  When Diane kicked the soda machine ...<br>  <br>  When Diane kicked it, what happened? Did the soda machine cough up her drink? Did the soda machine fall on top of poor Diane, crushing her underneath? Did quarters start shooting out of the coin return slot? Because you no longer have a complete thought, you no longer have a main clause.<br>  <br>  Because a giant spider has made its home behind the shampoo bottle in Neil's bathroom ...<br>  <br>  Because the giant spider lives there now, what has happened? Did Neil buy a can of insecticide? Does Neil now refuse to bathe? Is the spider starving because there are not enough insects for her to eat? The word because, a subordinate conjunction, leaves the idea unfinished, so you no longer have a main clause.<br>  <br>  Even though Sima and Michele are skipping their chemistry class to sit by the lake and watch the sun sparkle on the water ...<br>  <br>  Even though Sima and Michele are skipping their chemistry class, what else are they doing? Are they also studying their notes? Are they contemplating how the water in the lake is composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms? Are they gossiping about their teacher? The addition of even though makes a subordinate clause.

You do need an interest in it, prior to going in...because there will be a lot of it.<br>  Interior designers furnish the buildings. Their role is extremely important.

No historical evidence supports an alternative folk etymology by which the word is traced to the letter "J" (characterizing the route a jaywalker follows).|`|UrWzdIsDaa	Jaywalking is unknown in many countries, for example the UK, because it is not illegal to walk on the roads or cross against a red light.

Throwing the toys is probably a form of entertainment for him and that's why he finds it funny.<br>  <br>  I also suggest some testing be done on him.

8nSyc0o3aa	A scientific name in which the same word is used for both genus and species, for example Vulpes vulpes (the red fox).|`|94ab0da7299b6d087039f5b8d0109652aa	A tautonym is a binomial scientific name in which the name of the genus and that of the species (referred to as the specific epithet in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature and the specific name in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature) are identical.<br>  <br>  Tautonymy (i.e., the usage of tautonyms) is permissible in zoological nomenclature (see List of tautonyms for examples), but tautonyms are considered illegitimate under the current nomenclature rules for botanical nomenclature (ICBN Art 23.4). One example of a botanical tautonym is Larix larix (L.) H.Karst (1881). The earliest name for the European larch is Pinus larix L. (1753) but Karsten did not agree with the placement of the species in Pinus and decided to move it to Larix. In making this new combination he created a tautonym, not acceptable under the rules (1906 onwards; the rules are retroactive). In such a case either the next earliest validly published name must be found, in this case Larix decidua Mill. (1768), or (in its absence) a new epithet must be published.<br>  <br>  However, it is allowed for the genus and species names to mean the same, without being identical in spelling. For instance, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi means bearberry twice, in Greek and Latin respectively; Picea omorica uses the Latin and Serbian terms for a pine. There are also instances of a repeat of the genus name with a slight modification, such as Lycopersicon lycopersicum (Greek and latinized Greek, the former name for the tomato). Differences as small as a single letter are permissible, as in the Jujube shrub, Ziziphus zizyphus.<br>  <br>  A tautonym is sometimes considered to be any word or term made from two identical parts or syllables, such as bonbon or da-da. The origin of this usage is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it is of relatively recent derivation, based on a loose understanding of the scientific usage. The general term in linguistics for such double words is reduplicants.|`|WZ0jWRasaa	A taxonomic designation, such as Gorilla gorilla, in which the genus and species names are the same, commonly used in zoology but no longer in botany.|`|RwMlqcptaa	A taxonomic designation, such as Gorilla gorilla, in which the genus and species names are the same, commonly used in zoology but no longer in botany....this is the meaning of tautonyms...|`|LHJb3wafaa	Something about latin names, see source

eS5VOgKfaa	A) Protists that graze on bacteria are: Flagellates, cilliates or rotifers.<br>  They use phagocytosis to ingest bacterial cells. Lyse them, and utilise them as a food source. Protists are also used in cleaning up water systems. This is often seen in many aquatic environments. (The above terms are easily googled!)<br>  <br>  B) Phagocytosis occurs by pseudopods- infolds of the plasma membrane that extend around a food source- forming around the bacterial cell and then being internalised into the protists' cytoplasm. Here it fuses with lysosomes or other hydrolytic enzymes and breaks open the cell to capture and use it as nutrition.<br>  <br>  C) White blood cells such as phagocytes (A cell, such as a white blood cell, that engulfs and absorbs waste material, harmful microorganisms, or other foreign bodies in the bloodstream and tissues.) employ this method for clearing bacteria from our systems. Phagocytes include- neutrophils, granulogytes, monocytes, macrophages. (and many others)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

fynzkVK4aa	The easiest way to go about a question like this is to make a bullet point type list of the similarities and differences between the 2 sources, e.g. for a similarity, both sources said Emily Dickinson wanted to disrupt the race, but a difference would be that one thought she wanted to kill herself doing it while the other did not.  <br>  <br>  Then use these bullet points in a paragraph or so to "discuss" the similarities and differences about the two sources, and ultimately come down on one side or the other; either say that the sources support each other or don't, based on the arguments you have laid out from your bullet point list.<br>  <br>  The second part is basically just asking you to use quotations or arguments made in the sources, as well as your own other knowledge of the period that you have covered in your course, to say which source you think is "right" (this also basically tells you that the answer to the first part is that the two sources do not support each other; if they did they would both have the same perspective and this question wouldn't make sense)...often with history a lot of it comes down to perspective, so there isn't really a "right" answer, as long as you can back up your arguments with source evidence from either the question itself or others you have studied.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

BnR4LLhxaa	When "so" is used as a conjunction, [ I was not feeling well today, so I did not go to school. ] then there should be a comma before it because that word joins two independent clauses. <br>  <br>  In your example, I think the comma before "so" is appropriate.

To me, "so" at that point implies the question "so what?"<br>  <br>  In a similar example, you could write "So what if I can't read properly."

2v8FSsiaaa	Yes. It will be hard but you don't necessarily need to talk in college. There are disabilities offices that help those students and I'm sure they would give the student the resources they need to communicate. (for example in my school we have people in the class volunteer to help that student all quarter long based on their need). So if a student can't write bc of an impairment then a classmate would serve as a note taker. I'm sure a classmate of yours would serve as a liaison between you and your professors.
xtGKbBkmaa	You should try to elaborate your topic. Expand it a little and state your point of view. Then also try to be frank. For my opinion, those speeches that are too elaborate will bore the audience and only use terms that your audience can relate to. Do not be over extravagant on your speech for it will bring up confusion. Except when you are doing the speech on people who can comprehend those terms use them!
Td8rp1sEaa	I agree the word HATE is used too often and inappropriately. The same is true of the word LOVE They should be used only to express real emotion, or they lose their power|`|6C9ap59paa	Well, it is not always that they want to hurt and so use the word hate. Quite often, it is because of their not thinking before they articulate. If they did think before they opened their mouth, I am sure they would use dislike rather than hate.|`|vYeS5mYnaa	ya i get it... they misuse sarcasm too and use it when they mean facetious.|`|3OoCiOkAaa	I don't think your question is dumb<br>  <br>  Hate is the epitome  of dislike. It is the strongest feeling of  contempt you can possess.<br>  <br>  May people use it as a hyperbole ( exaggeration) to display strong emotions. <br>  <br>  <br>  The chances of stopping hatred are as slim as stopping people from falling in love. It is impossible. <br>  <br>  Hatred is usually caused by intolerance of a person or people that you cannot relate too.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Being nice is not necessarily the answers as a lot of people who hate can be superficially quite charming or pleasant. It is being tolerant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The first answerer was intolerant of you - as your opinion differed from his own. He is on his first step to hatred.<br>  <br>  <br>  While I think your question is naive and awkwardly phrased- I can emphasise with your point of view.  I can also tolerate that your view is different to my own. I have not dismissed you or castigated you. which is the first step to stop hating people.<br>  <br>  <br>  However there are still people in this world whose behaviour and opinions impact on me negatively,  therefore I am not prepared to tolerate them. So yes I do 'hate' them. <br>  <br>  <br>  But hate it doesn't consume me and I do not think about them all the time. I only remember them when I am talking about hatred. <br>  <br>  It is a scary fact that hate and hate rage can be controlled in many people and only surface at appropriate times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hence psychopathic killers like Ted Bundy, Dennis Rader, Gary Ridgeway, John Wayne Gacy can be popular hard working men and liked by their community, family and colleagues. Then go out and murder people in cold blood- instigated by hate.<br>  <br>  <br>  The older you get the more you will understand the complexities of the human mind <br>  <br>  The fact people profess to hate when they really don't is equally as destructive as the emotion of hate it to the person on the receiving end. Regardless of their intention or true feelings.<br>  <br>  I think you are right  and people use the word,  because it hurts. In general people are becoming more abusive and any disagreement seems to end in  inappropriate abuse, dysphemism  or  irrational offense.|`|WBQsS7CLaa	people don't know the difference because they are idiots|`|AA10520442	Because people no longer teach their children to not use the word "hate".  I was always told that hate is a strong word and should be reserved for only the deepest disdain.  I say that I am not fond of something or it doesn't do much for me, etc.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I think some people think the word hate is the opposite of love.  So it is the extreme dislike of something or someone.  Those two words are actually alike in the sense that they are both extreme emotions.  I think the opposite of love is apathy - you just don't care.<br>  <br>  I always chuckle to myself when I hear someone say "I hate him" because 90% of the time they really don't.  If you hate something you still have emotions invested in that person,place or thing.<br>  <br>  I hate it when posters disapprove of your question, but they still write something so inane such as the two already posted.  If they are disgusted that they wasted a few seconds to read your question, why do they take the time to post a reply?  If I am not thrilled or if I am not interested in the subject, I just go on to the next one.<br>  <br>  When I think of hate, I think it is a word expressing a general bias or prejudice.  It is a very strong word.  "Dislike" is just not powerful enough sometimes.  I hate child molesters and people that are cruel to animals.  In this sentence, "dislike" wouldn't express my distain or how appalled I am at these things.

K5IOSGXAaa	Wow what a bunch of rude little snots. So much for their religious beliefs. The only thing I can tell you is to stop doing your work and get your grades to go boom. That will get your parents attention, although it is a really dramatic way to do so. Or just start crying every day in front of them. Something has to wake them up out of their indifference to your plight. Look, I know that going to school is not supposed to be a social event, but rather to get an education, but that's just awful. Meanwhile just keep your head up. And if someone is mean to you call them on it, don't let them get away with it. You know you are a valuable person, don't let them make you feel otherwise. And don't put up with it just to have someone to sit with at lunch.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Usually not. You need a minimum accounting coursework amount before being allowed to sit for the exam.  The amount varies but is usually anywhere from 18 - 30 credit hours of upper division accounting courses (intro courses do not count).  In addition, there may be business-related credit hours required as well (18 - 30 ).  So if you never came from a business program you will certainly not qualify.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, be warned that an MBA accounting program is designed for students who majored in accounting or at least was a business major of some sort in their undergrad.  This is as you cannot take any upper level accounting courses without first having taken an intermediate accounting sequence.  Accounting is highly sequential.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a CPA i would advise skipping an overpriced MBA program and either do a second bachelor's in accounting, or take an executive program in accounting fundamentals that conveniently wraps up all the required CPA accounting courses in one package (typically offered at better business schools).  If you absolutely need a masters, look for a master's in accounting.  it's more relevant.|`|Moz2d806aa	Yes. However, you will probably be required to take a few accounting classes at the undergrad level before starting the graduate classes.

PTvXM5Qjaa	hey. in our school, we actually discussed sex ed. but it's not what you think. we just discussed sex ed just like how we discussed smoking, drugs, etc. Our teacher just taught us the background of sex ed, effects, etc, usual  stuff. nothing perverted, really.<br>  <br>  and schools are still schools. i believe that no matter what, the faculty in each school doesn't teach students bad things. schools still have a reputation that they need to improve and take care of so i don't think the teachers or the faculty will do something that will dirty their reputation right?<br>  <br>  actually, i don't think that teaching sex ed in public high schools are bad since just like what i said earlier, the teachers avoid bad remarks about their teachings so they'll avoid teaching dirty things to their students and dirty their reputation and at the same time, the reputation of the whole school. <br>  <br>  for me, i think, if ever that there are some bad things that you heard from a student about their teacher teaching sex ed (like the student will say that their teacher is a pervert because he said something like condoms or anything), it's not the teacher's fault but the student's since the teacher is there to just teach but it's actually the student's brain, imagination and learning skills that will analyze and give impressions to what the teacher said, right??|`|9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	This can vary from school district to school district ours does not give out condoms but it gives a very good powerpoint presentation.|`|Be6oUPd5aa	well I'm 19 and when i was in high school they pretty much discouraged sex greatly, which should be i think. You wouldn't just want a bunch of kids to start having sex and get pregnant. Anyways, they talked alot about STD's and how having sex with a person these days is like having sex with 50 other people cause you're pretty much having sex with everyone they've had sex with. Just junk like that. oh and they dont pass out condoms!<br>  <br>  And in high school i did have sex with my gf at the time. But only 5 times in my life so i'm not a regular dude =)

AA10276327	I assume your question is this:<br>  What does this sentence mean? "I now have a taste from something good and I want more."<br>  <br>  A twist on the old proverb is "Give a person an apple, and he'll take the whole bushel."<br>  This is the selling point for those companies that give out free samples or offer upgrades to their products.

EW0ILvMoaa	If children of an appropriate developmental age (say 31/2+) are together in role play they can begin to learn skills to co-operate with one another in order to 'play out' experiences. Putting themselves into other roles enables them to see things from other viewpoints.They come to rely on one another to 'bounce ideas' back and forth in order to understand more about themselves and one another. It is the adults role to be attentive and to step in and support the children when they require help with problems they may have (for example a disagreement) The adult can use 'sustained shared thinking' to support 'social problem solving' hopefully reinforcing and developing 'friendship and togetherness' (what i would refer to as 'positive relationships' - hope this helps x

Imagine her reactions, and see the other person in the piece. Remember, monologues are really dialogues in which the other person doesn't speak. <br>  <br>  Step7: Practice performing the monologue first to an inanimate object. Then perform it for a trusted professional, such as a fellow actor or a casting director, and get feedback. <br>  <br>  Step8: Try performing the monologue in several different ways. Be prepared to perform it more than one way at the audition. <br>  <br>  Step9: Time yourself and make sure the monologue fits the length acceptable for the audition (usually one to three minutes).

lZa9R7IFaa	Its a tricky situation.<br>  <br>  If Cognizant has given any concrete date, then wait, otherwise it would be futile, cuz 1 year might turn to 2 years of wait.....<br>  <br>  alternatively, you can take up some job or a 1 year course (say, like computers etc., which might be relevant to your field of study), cuz MBA can be done later too.<br>  <br>  However, the priority and choice is yours, if you feel, you can get better opportunity than wait for Cognizant, then do your MBA.<br>  <br>  Take a call !!!|`|ho96HPqoaa	Dear Friend,<br>  <br>  First you confirm from cognizant if they are not interest then think for next action of career. i think if u have any good aim with mba than you do MBA otherwise you try to get good job. you cant do MBA with job also.|`|PHgGlHwNaa	the best choice would be MBA

73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Unfortunately there is no easy way to learn the multiplication tables.One way to learn them more thoroughly and somewhat faster is to have him write them out over and over. For some reason writing things down helps you remember them more. Have him do one level per night every night such as one night write out his 9 times tables over and over for about a half an hour. Then another times the next night. Especially the ones he has problems with. Test him after every writing session and at random times too such as when he is having dinner quiz him something like what is 8 times 9. Make it a game if you can even make him a chart and give him a star for each random quiz question he gets right and after 10 stars he gets a treat.|`|G50ucmllaa	My only advice is for 9's...up to 10, the two digits will always add to 9.  (9, 18, 27, 36...).  Also when multiplying 11 up to 9, the two digits will be the same (11, 22, 33, 44...).|`|uX4FDZnvaa	have you tried using fun an exciting ways of teaching like with fun objects then they can be more interested in it.|`|rpK7ZUKBaa	UK<br>  Carol Vaudaman has brought out a great cd which helps the child with maths|`|znXpeCiJaa	There is a tip to learn multiplication table for 9:<br>  <br>  First, extend your 10 fingers, then get the answer by the following method:<br>  <br>  1 x 9 = 9 (fold your 1st finger of your left hand, the answer is 9 because there are 9 fingers unfold at the right side of the folded finger)<br>  <br>  2 x 9 = 18 (fold the 2nd finger of your left hand, the answer is 18 because there is one finger unfold at the left side of the folded finger and there are 8 fingers unfold at the right side of the folded finger)<br>  <br>  this continues until 10 x 9 = 90|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Here are some tips I have used in helping children with times tables<br>  <br>  1.  track progress with a chart.  This will help the child set goals and feel a sense of accomplishment when they meet them.<br>  <br>  2.  Daily practice is a must.  Use flash cards and wipe off mats (you can make these using lamination or contact paper) with times test on them are great for at home use.<br>  <br>  3.  One technique I use a lot is starting with just a few flash cards of difficult ones (2-5) and going through them over and over until they remember them.  Then adding a few more and repeating the process.  <br>  <br>  4.  Another flash card technique I use is to pull out all the cards with one number, like all the 4 cards.  I then time the child in how long it takes to get through the stack.  We then repeat this and try to lower the time.  This brings out their competitive spirit and kids usually love it because they enjoy lowering their time. <br>  <br>  5.  Finally talk a lot about the importance of knowing your times tables.  The bottom line is if a child doesn't want to or try to learn them, they won't.  Even using the idea that knowing them makes homework take less time is convincing.  I also would talk a lot about how they still have a lot of school left, times tables do not go away.  You need them in every grade and in lots of advanced math.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't give up.  For a lot of kids those higher numbers can be tough!|`|AA10188961	There's no trick.  It's memorization, consistent practice and hard work.  There are different methods of practice that can make the learning fun, but don't fall for people's tricks.  The finger trick, while interesting, does not help your child when they have to know 99 x 7.  <br>  <br>  Different methods I use in class: math balls (beach balls with multiplication problems written in sharpie) whatever problem your left thumb lands on is the problem you have to answer.<br>  <br>  Multiplication Bingo, dominoes both at  enchantedlearning.com<br>  <br>  Dice game called Farkel.  <br>  <br>  math game at softseven.com<br>  <br>  Card game, played like war, but you have to solve the multiplication problem of the two cards to get the cards. * Ex- Susie lays down a 10 Jen lays down a 5-- the first one to say 50 gets the cards.|`|JnbayIOwaa	The fingers technique.<br>  <br>  Could cause them to be lazy though.<br>  <br>  Hold up your ten fingers in front of you.<br>  <br>  1x9 is 9 obviously.<br>  <br>  Now hold down the second finger in from the left. Becoming the 2x. But you don't count the finger being held down.<br>  <br>  So the one finger to the left is the tens. and the 8 others are the units.<br>  <br>  So 2x9=18. Then repeat for the 3x. Hold down the third finger. two tens to the left and seven to the right. 3x9=27<br>  <br>  this technique only works up to 10 times though. ha ha it helped me when i was little any way.|`|xVeEFLydaa	try games. like put chocolates or cookies in groups of 2(for eg).<br>  u may lay them on ur dining table / floor.<br>  <br>  then tell him two two's are four<br>  <br>  have him count the cookies group by group to ten. <br>  have him count the no. of groups. <br>  u may tell him the sum/ total no. of cookies = no. of groups * no. of cookie in each group.<br>  <br>  u may use his favorite toys/ children to make these groups.|`|Q5XcNNoWaa	try making up a song that is fun and exciting for the child.|`|uXfOVkWeaa	I had a big poster and a cd.

Writing in a different base, like Log(4), will give you the exponent you raise 4 to; 4 to the power of Log(4) 16 is asking which power 4 needs to be raised to to equal 16.

You can also look at "Vathek" by Beckford for the demon idea (it is a weird one but a classic in gothic literature). As far as basic information on Gothic literature and the ideas behind them and why they are considered Gothic you can look at Fred Botting's book, Gothic. <br>  <br>  Also remember to use props or pictures, it uses up time if you don't have a lot to say and it makes it more interesting.<br>  <br>  You may also want to show the contrast between gothic literature and other genres. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|bKDBbGmuaa	dude i am the man just  add me then we will email i swear you need my help

Do not do anything else until it is done. (I used to do this in HS to avoid forgetting it). You should be done by dinner time then you can have your evenings for family and relaxing time. Plus you won't lose sleep because you're doing homework.<br>  <br>  If you're still having problems. Have fun in school and one day on the weekends. Limit yourself to that.

GTUUy3ccaa	Sounds like a great idea. What if you write about how they never see each other? For instance, you can talk about how the moon came across the sun's path one day (solar eclipse). And how rare it is to see a couple so breathtakingly beautifully. Their feelings were so strong that the sun visits the spot they met, pacing around to find her everyday(daylight) until he's tired and goes home (dusk). No sooner than he leaves the moon takes her place in the sky (night) desperately looking for her love until she's so tired. As the sun returns to the sky, he just barely misses her (dawn). They repeat this process until finally they meet again (solar eclipse). Also, maybe you can talk about how the moon needs the light (love) from the sun in order to be seen. Kinda like the moon wouldn't exist without the light from the sun...Let me know what you think!!|`|lPNP9bt2aa	the moon goddess in love with the sun god<br>  the where a nice couple but also a strong enemy<br>  the jealous goddess of earth<br>  that she wanted them apart<br>  so she make the sun to blind the moon with his light<br>  and the moon became afraid of him<br>  so when the sun comes out the moon disappear<br>  but the sun knows that he was not him aim to blind the moon<br>  and he still loves her<br>  so  he protect her every night and he give her his light so that the moon can always find the the suns path !!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  search in greek mythology about helios and selene <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  that all folks!|`|uHxfAyjBaa	Simple really...just go with the story of all relationships.<br>  <br>  Abridged version....<br>  <br>  The Sun meets the Moon...they fall in love...after a time the Moon starts having sex with one of the Suns friends...The Sun finds out...even though he has done nothing wrong the courts give the Moon all his possessions and custody of his children.<br>  <br>  The Sun ends up a bitter and twisted alcoholic.<br>  <br>  Ahhh..the eternal story.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now that is a true story.

You may have been able to receive aid this whole time. <br>  <br>  Also, fill out the FAFSA|`|ZwN7XGoOaa	In California Community College is still a bargain even after our "governator" raised fees yet again. He said he didn't believe in raising taxes (Oh.So raising college fees for poor students is not a "tax"?) I suggest equal treatment for poor people.Tax the homeless to subsidize the tax CUTS for the rich .Arnold basically went to Santa Monica Community College for free back in 1974.There are State and Federal Grants available and Scholarships that don't have to be paid back .Community College is the best way to get your requirements out of the way cheaply. Then you decide if you want to burden yourself with student loans and then only go with subsidized ones.Based on your situation if you're good student with less than average family income--the world is your oyster. If your an average student with an average income you should consider emigrating to Dubai.

Castle rock, the large black rock, is the site where Jack names Sam and Eric (formerly Ralph's biggest allies) as his lieutenants.<br>  6. Eric is wounded in the initial fight between Jack's troups and the littleuns (sent as a first line of offense by Ralph).<br>  Chapter 12<br>  7. Ralph is both intrigued and repelled by both the beast and the savages, reflecting the duality of man.<br>  8. Jack is testing their loyalty, suggesting that if they were truly loyal, the twins would kill themselves on either end of the spear if he needed them to.<br>  9. Jack uses Simon's connection to the Beast to lead him to the cave where Ralph has set up his people.<br>  10. The fire is meant as a final farewell to the world they have left behind.

With that said, I think it's wonderful that you are doing this for your charges without being required to so. It shows dedication to your work.<br>  <br>  I think I would lay out your report by breaking it up into small development headings, e.g. social, gross motor skills, etc. Then under each heading put what you are working on, new milestones gained, etc. I would think that most responsible parents want to hear what the child is doing well and where they could use help, that way the parents can work on it at home as well.<br>  <br>  Take care|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Well...to be honest I would worry if you capitalised every word like you just did in this post.|`|AA11570675	If I started receiving reports on my 2-3 year old child in a private nursery, I would immediately remove the child from the nursery!<br>  Children all develop differently and at 2-3 years of age some aspects of development have not even begun to show, but it doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the child or that adults should interfere to try & change it. I believe that at that age Einstein wasn't even talking!<br>  I appreciate your concerns that parents may not think you're doing anything to earn your fees, but with children of that age it is usually far better to enable them to develop their curiosity rather than have an adult's agenda thrust upon them. The latter could actually inhibit their development & they might never learn to initiate things for themselves. <br>  So if you're going to write reports, keep them to yourself & don't pass them on to parents. That way you will be prepared & able to respond to parents' concerns, but also you will have the joy of surprise when the child begins to develop autonomy & initiative.
qpMfWbGfaa	Chapter Six<br>  8. Absolutely. When Ralph gets Jack to succumb during the group meeting, he assumes absolute leadership (for the time being anyway).<br>  9. Ralph recognizes the potential threat in Jack, and believes that by finding the Beast himself, any doubts of his leadership will be diminished.<br>  10. On a literal level, Ralph's obsession with the Beast and Jack's with the pig hunt show their differences. On a more figurative level, Ralph's desires are connected to faith while Jack is firmly in the realm of fact.<br>  <br>  Chapter 7<br>  1. Ralph cannot find the Beast and wonders if Simon has lead him astray.<br>  2. The dancing is more savage, with louder beatings on the hollowed log, pushing, and even biting. Golding incorporates several cattle images and sounds to reflect their herd mentality.<br>  3. Ralph knows that if Jack realizes that he is searching for the Beast, Jack and Samneric will do the same.<br>  Chapter 8<br>  4. Jack is furious to find out that Simon has betrayed him, and has given Ralph clues to the whereabouts of the Beast.<br>  5. While Ralph is in the jungle, Jack tries to convince the littleuns that he would be the best leader and that they have to banish Ralph from their 'tribe' once a for all. Of course, there is considerable reluctance, considering Ralph and Jack's debate in Chapter Six, but the littleuns are eventually persuaded to follow Jack to the big black rock.<br>  6. The big black rock, since it is strategically the best place to see potential threats (in Jack's mind, Ralph and the Beast).<br>  7. Simon is told by the pig's head (the true Beast) that Ralph is the one who is entitled to be the leader of the island, the true Lord of the Flies. This reference to the title is also a reference to Beelzebub, a devil whose title is the Lord of the Flies. Golding uses this as a reflection of the growing evil present in the boys on the island.<br>  8. Simon knows that the power of the pig's head is true and that any hopes of survival or rescue are gone.<br>  9. Ralph is told by Piggy that Jack has been jockeying for power, so Ralph decides he needs to prove that he is not elitist and is indeed the proper leader of the group. Ralph, now in possession of the Beast, seems to be in a position to cement his leadership of the tribe.<br>  10. Jack claims that Simon is the beast to deflect attention from Ralph's discovery in the jungle. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

byvQUCgJaa	This was a previous answer:<br>  <br>  JAMES - English and Scottish form of the name borne in the New Testament by two of Christ's disciples, James son of Zebedee and James son of Alphaeus. This form comes from Late Latin Iacomus, a variant of Iacobus, Latin form of the New Testament Greek name Iakobos. This is the same name as Old Testament Jacob (Hebrew Yaakov). For many centuries now it has been thought of in the English-speaking world and elsewhere as a distinct name, but in some other cultures, e.g. French, no distinction is made. In Britain, James is a royal name that from the beginning of the 15th century onwards has been associated particularly with the Scottish house of Stewart: James I of Scotland (1394–1437; ruled 1424–37) was a patron of the arts and a noted poet, as well as an energetic monarch. King James VI of Scotland (1566–1625; reigned 1567–1625) succeeded to the throne of England in 1603. His grandson, James II of England (1633–1701; reigned 1685–8) was a Roman Catholic, deposed in 1688 in favour of his Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. From then on he, his son (also called James), and his grandson Charles (“Bonnie Prince Charlie”) made various unsuccessful attempts to recover the English throne. Their supporters were known as Jacobites (from Jacobus, Latin form of James), and the name James became for a while particularly associated with Roman Catholicism on the one hand, and Highland opposition to the English government on the other. It is now widely used by people of many different creeds and nationalities. Cognates: French: Jacques. Italian: Giacomo. Spanish: Jaime. Catalan: Jaume. Galician: Xaime. Irish: Séamas, Séamus, Seumas, Seumus (Gaelic); Shamus (Anglicized). Scottish: Seumas (Gaelic); Hamish (Anglicized). Cornish: Jago. See also Jem.|`|Td8rp1sEaa	....or.... Supplanter

At least he isn't bored anymore." or "Here lies ________. This world will trul miss him/her.<br>  <br>  May I also suggest taking some time to really soul search.  It's easy to say there is no God and just do whatever you want till you die and thats the end of it.  But what if it's truly not?  Would you rather find out when it's too late?  Just take some time to sit and look into your heart and the world around you.  Take some time to pray and ask God to reveal Himself to you in a real way.  Don't expect Him to just pop out and say "Boo! Here I am."  Instead take the time to see how he talks to you.  Whether it be from life lessons learned (and maybe some you've missed), or from watching nature work in such harmony (until man messes it up).|`|ISPIa0n5aa	Read<br>  Play Video Games<br>  Surf the Internet<br>  Call you Mother|`|BaQ6LtzNaa	Do whatever you feel like doing...|`|9PQRHwnaaa	if i were u and if u have a instrument play that or go play games on line|`|aekmbhz7aa	anything|`|xorpp0JQaa	video games|`|5JRpnFeRaa	myspace it

767862fac913cacc2a85deeb280cab44aa	There once was a boy that wanted a pet from the local pet store. He asked his mother if he could get a puppy. His mother told him that puppies are too much work to care for. Later his mother had an idea that was better than a puppy. She took him to the local pet shop where they where retired racing greyhounds were for sale. He was amazed at how tall they were and how nice they were. His mother bought him one that was potty-trained. After the boy and his mother went to the pet store to buy the required things needed to keep the greyhound happy and alive they started on their way home. The boy thanked his mother in the car and she told him that she was glad that he is happy. That day was such a beautiful day for the greyhound and the family.|`|lKof1n0Xaa	What the hell, thats EASY!<br>  If you're having trouble containing your story to only 10 sentences, you could try writing long, sophisticated sentences, with many commas, as I am doing right now to demonstrate to you the easiness of your task.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	davids week is full of interesting hobbies<br>  every Monday he went to the gym and run 2 kms<br>  every Tuesday he is going to the club and play games with his friends <br>  every......<br>  every......<br>  every......<br>  every...<br>  every.....<br>  that is the nice way that davids pass his week and that is why he is full of energy and all his friends love him1|`|e2bd814fd390628d5470e9b75f865dd8aa	Once upon a time, there was a great supreme being named Robotron.<br>  His mother died giving birth to him in an explosion of internal organs and candy. <br>  His mother was a pinyata, and she enjoyed being beaten by bats. <br>  Sadly she died.<br>  His father was Robocop, except instead of cool guns, he was on welfare.<br>  Robotron was made fun of in high school....until he hit puberty.<br>  Once puberty hit, he grew 30 feet, and became a bully.<br>  He got into a fight with chuck norris and beat his a**.<br>  Why you may be asking yourself?<br>  It is because of chuck norris that Robotron could not grow facial hair.

AA10023710	You say you may want to go to med school. It would be best for you to go to a strong university, then. Of those you've been accepted to, the strongest, by far, is Rutgers NB. Drexel is also good. I'd reject U of the Sciences and NYIT, to be honest.     Of those you're waiting on, you have some really strong schools there. The best are USC, Rice, NYU, Texas, Northeastern and TCNJ, possibly in that order, more or less. I might reject the Mass College of Pharm.     Have you visited the schools yet? You should visit, or revisit, any that you're seriously considering. Often, a campus visit can really tell you if the school is a fit for you or not.

3e34f165ad30f58bf7f1417310ff9c96aa	A country has a flag so it can be identified a bit easier it is also a form of national emblem   I come from the Isle of Man   The flag of the Isle of Man shows a triskelion, the Three Legs of Mann emblem, in the centre of a red flag. The three legs are joined at the thigh and bent at the knee. In order to have the toes pointing clockwise on both sides of the flag, a two-sided emblem is used.    The Manx flag is based on the coat-of-arms of the last recognized Norse King of Mann, Magnus III. A modified version of this coat-of-arms is still in use by Magnus' descendants in Norway, the Skanke family.    The triskelion has its roots in an early Celtic sun symbol that was also used by many other ancient civilizations including the Mycenaeans and the Lycians. The flag is similar to that of Sicily.

I wish universities were the bastions of free thought that they advertise themselves to be, but that's a complete lie. I find that most professors, department events, student clubs/newspaper, etc. have an overwhelming political bias. There are some Canadian universities who have actually made it illegal for student clubs that have certain stances on ethical issues to exist. One big reason why I decided to major in math/science is because I wanted to avoid biased professors in the humanities/social sciences even though I like essay writing, thinking about philosophy, etc. as much as technical subjects.

74209f509512526a7c775597bcd23f8eaa	I am thinking, if you truly have no idea how to do even basic arithmatic then you should look to books at the 3rd - 5th grade level (US).<br>  These books will have topics such as : adding, subtracting, division, and multiplying whole numbers, fractions and decimals. It should go into Percentages, perhpaps ratios, etc. <br>  this is a great place to begin though, master this material very well before moving on to the next level. However, this is not something you will do overnight, this would take time to learn and it is not something you can do one or two times and say you know it.

bd4655812037ba3fc569444637f2ca05aa	Yes, your college acceptance can be taken away.  Remember, your acceptance is contingent upon your final high school grades. I know what you mean about senioritis and having hard classes.  I was in the exact same situation in high school, but it's no excuse.  Look at it this way: if you lose your college acceptance, then all of the work you've done will be a complete waste!  <br>  <br>  You need to bring up that average.  It's not a big deal if your average is slightly lower than in previous years unless your GPA was the minimum GPA that this college requires.  However, if there is a significant drop (from 4.0 to 3.2 for instance), then this will be a red flag for the college admissions office.  <br>  <br>  Try studying in short chunks of time if the material doesn't hold your interest. ASK your teachers for help.  If you find the work too hard, then talk to them,  No, they won't give you easier assignments, but they will help you understand the material.  A teacher is more likely to give you a better grade if they see that you're making a real effort in the class and one way to show that you're trying to learn is by asking for help.|`|bcTErNF6aa	Persistence and Dedication|`|1EhbLBkUaa	Yes, colleges can revoke an acceptance, based on final grades or other issues.  After all, if you get into the habit of being lazy one year, why would you suddenly do better the next, especially when college is usually both more distracting and more difficult than high school?  <br>  <br>  I had trouble with that myself; high school was too easy, and I slacked a bit in my last semester of high school on top of that, just coasting, and really had a hard time getting up to speed freshman year in college. Try to pick yourself up a bit and get more on top of your classes -- especially any that lead into your college classes, where you'll need mastery of the knowledge to continue (such as math classes, if you're majoring in science or engineering).  You'll thank yourself next semester.|`|AA11811168	It depends.. If your average dropped from an A to an A- then no. But if you dropped more than a grade level, depending on how prestigious this school is (would have been helpful to know by the way) they could. However, you are probably going to be safe but it wouldn't hurt to lose "senioritis." I graduated last year and I just said I had senioritis when I didnt want to work....and this laziness will not help in college so trust me, learn how to motivate yourself now and not in the fall when your teachers are less understanding.|`|gaWZ79gNaa	you sure can. do your best to keep your grades up or ask your teachers if they offer any extra credit assignments<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtL1yrRNSM5nfjN2Hu0Px_jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225052926AA3kQ61">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

So if i sit there for an hour I will retain the first and last thing = 2 things.<br>  If I broke that up to two 1/2 hour sections I'd retain 2 first thngs and 2 last things = 4 things.<br>  <br>  So if you have a lot of material to cover, break it up into smaller sections. For one it is easier to keep your focus for a short period of time than it is for a longer period of time. Two you will retain more of the material if it is broken into smaller sections.

To help prevent the spread of the disease, teachers can't just slap a band aid on a child like they used to be able to. They have to put on gloves, clean the wound, and then call the janitor to disinfect anywhere the blood touched. Then they have to send anything with the blood on it to the nurse so it can be disposed of properly (no more bloody Kleenexes in the trash).

I knew people who did not graduate, and while they managed to barely get by with jobs at supermarkets or fast food restaurants, they never managed to get anywhere beyond that. A lot of my friends who haven't finished college are having the same issues. (I am currently pursuing a college degree, but due to health issues, it is taking me longer than originally planned)<br>  <br>  Some high school students drop out and do a simple night GED program. Some high schools offer at home studies for students who have learning dissabilities, or other physical/emotional needs that require a more flexible schedule and less stduent on student interaction.<br>  <br>  I won't tell you not to drop out, but I will tell you to finish your education. Even students with college degrees are having trouble finding jobs in today's economy. The higher your level of education, the better your chance of  finding a good job.<br>  <br>  Con's?<br>  You can't get a good job.<br>  You're generally uneducated<br>  You miss a lot of emotional/social growth that happens in high school (even if, like me, you aren't really a part of any specific group)<br>  If you do decide to go to college, you have to go back and finish your GED, and then move forward<br>  <br>  The list continues.<br>  <br>  I would like to know WHY you are considering dropping out so that the answer could be better tailored to your needs. I.E. looking up programs that may better suit your learning needs. (I know a sixteen year old, almost seventeen, who is going to graduate high school almost a year early, after missing a year due to some legal issues, and ON TOP of that, she hasn't been required to go to a formal class since tenth grade. She does it all at home with help from a school assigned tutor.)|`|QRrURcQDaa	Pros: You get to hang out with friends more, you get more free time, you have a reason to be uneducated.<br>  Cons: You won't get a paying job, people will use you more, you'll be stupid (uneducated). and you;re friends won't think highly of you anymore.|`|AA10272321	Pros- You'll always have a job at your local fast food restaurant...Cons- Gosh, I can't think of any.

AA12034021	So this is about 18 cents?  How often does this customer shop at your store?  If you refuse and (in the customer's eyes) cheat the customer of 18 cents, you can bet that they will tell all their friends about it, and maybe 9 other friends will stop shopping at your store.  How much money will these 10 customers spend over say the next 10 years (i.e. that they would have spent at your store, but now are spending at someone else's store)?<br>  <br>  The example I saw was for a grocery store in the U.S.A. and those 10 customers spent about a million dollars over the course of that 10 years.  Your situation may be different (you don't say what kind of store it is, not that I have the statistics for that kind of store).  Are you willing to loose a million dollars over 18 cents?<br>  <br>  There is a reason that "the customer is always right" is good business.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	What do you do?

That all depends on her credit score, her income, her payment history (they won't lend to her if she's behind on her other debts), etc. <br>  <br>  Without co-signers, my husband and I would not have been able to go to college. My wife's grandmother co-signed for her for her freshman & sophomore years b/c she did not have enough credit history to do it alone. My  mom co-signed for me my freshman year only. They understood that we needed help initially. <br>  <br>  Please keep in mind though that once your mother is listed as a co-signer on a student loan, her credit will be affected, not just yours. You have to pay back your loan for about 3 years (don't remember the exact timeframe) without missing ANY payments OR putting your loans in forbearance to remove her as a co-signer. Even with a good co-signer, you're looking at a 10-13% adjustable interest rate for private student loans (like Sallie Mae). You have to think about your future-- what if you can't find a job after you graduate? A lot of recent college graduates are having a HARD time finding jobs now! And declaring bankruptcy will not get rid of your student loan debt. All it will do is trash your credit for 7 years. <br>  <br>  My advice, apply for scholarships & FAFSA! I know friends from low-income families who went to college for free with FAFSA. I know another friend who has academic scholarships & only has to pay $300 a year (and that's just random fees that our college charges). Tuition is $23,000 here now & she only has to pay $300. Think about that. Scholarships will also hold you accountable to making good grades.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|24dQzG9Yaa	ya u can get but just check out the details with the bank u wanna take loan.if the bank ur taking loan and ur mom's having loan is the same one ask them.if its adiff one u can get it.and there a loan limit of 4 lk without surity<br>  for the above they ask some surity..u may not relay on ur mom for small sum|`|yPYfweIGaa	yes.  <a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com/loansandhomes/promos/jump/refiglide/?" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankofamerica.com/loansandhom...</a><br>  <br>  first work on your spelling.

If you want home based software, for you and your family I would recommend Digital Frog as they have several good programs that take you through everything from the Cell, to disecting a frog digitally.<br>  <br>  If you are after School related software, that is licenses for a school, it will be considerably more expensive. I did attach a link yo ucan follow to check it out for your self. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, hope it helps.
QUktpkPQaa	Well, you could homeschool him. It sounds like you're leaning that way anyway. But that won't teach him to socialize with kids his age in a classroom environment, which sounds like a large part of the  problem. I'm not sure where teachers get the idea that kids are supposed to be "mature" and intensely focused on their schoolwork at all times. I hear the same thing about my second grader. But the way he acts, it doesn't really sound as though he's ready for the next grade level. Have you really exhausted every option at the school? You say that you've spoken to all of these people and it hasn't been productive. Are you truly listening to them, or are you just voicing a laundry list of your own perceptions? Being held back a year isn't the end of the world- particularly if he's a year younger than everyone in his class now. If you think he'll be bored then expand what you're doing at home to give him a firmer foundation for his future academic endeavors.|`|SIQNnfnnaa	Why not get him to do some more difficult tasks at home and then take them in to show his current teacher. You could then maybe suggest she tries some first grade work out on him to see if this holds his attention more or if it is just a general case of him being distracted. This way, this may prove he is ready for first grade just like everyone else and this may also give them an insight next time if he gets distracted, that his works too easy.

Mean = Sum of data divided by the total number of observations. <br>  <br>  There is no way someone can explain the graph by typing - you need to check out <a href="http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/cumulative-frequency-graph.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/cumula...</a> - it will give you a visual example of creating a graph - its very easy - you just need to see it visually.<br>  <br>  Without giving a specific example this is tough to explain by typing. You will have to do some reading to get through this. Good Luck.|`|EkhEvfXFaa	1. The following video will show you how to draw a cumulative frequency graph and polygon.  It won't show you how to use it.  Also an ogive is a smooth curve and is not the same as the polygon.  Depends what your book does I suppose, just do that.<br>  <br>  Just do a google search if you want more info coz there's heaps of info there.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. To find the mean for grouped data, find the midpoint of each group by adding the lower class limit to the upper class limit and dividing this sum by 2. Note once you've got the first class mid-point you just have to add the class width each time to get the rest.<br>  <br>  Then multiply the midpoint by the corresponding frequency add all these together and divide that sum by the SUM of the FREQUENCIES.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  The class width for this is 10 - 0 = 10 [OR 19 - 9 = 10]<br>  <br>  Class Interval ..... Class Midpoint .......... Frequency ..... midpoint x ?<br>  0 - 9 .................. (0 + 9) / 2 = 4.5 ............... 4 ................ 18<br>  10 - 19 ............... 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 ............... 8 ................ 116<br>  20 - 29 ....................... 24.5 ....................... 10 .............. 245<br>  30 - 39 ....................... 34.5 ....................... 2 ................ 69<br>  <br>  Sum of (class midpoints x frequency) = 448<br>  <br>  Sum of frequencies = 24<br>  <br>  Mean = 448 / 24 = 18.7
AA11811168	Well, at my school, you get a major in history and a concentration in social studies teaching, a license that allows you to teach psych, econ, us history, world history etc.<br>  You could just get your teacher licensure, but there wont be one for just psychology. you will havve to study up for the praxis exam....or apply at private schools, sometimes their hiring requirements are different.<br>  <br>  After you teach for a while, your principal may consider letting you teach ap, so you then need to take courses offered by college board, learning how to teach AP level classes.

FCQ079mRaa	Mutations are changes to the nucleotide sequence of the genetic material of an organism - don't use that wording - teacher will know it wasn't your own writing. Mutations can be caused by copying errors in genetic material during cell division, exposure to radiation, chemical mutagens, viruses. <br>  <br>  natural selection is simply nature's way of ensuring favorable heritable traits are passed on or created to help a species survive and be more efficient, and negative traits become less common ovetime. Natural selection is the component allowing evolution to take place in population of organisms. <br>  <br>  New species form when there is a need for change to survive - but it can take thousands of years. Climate change, changes to food supply can cause evolution.

VCIZJQCJaa	obligations huh,is there any chance you can take nursing at the university, at least the general  requirement classes to transfer to rn.(english and comp. chemistry, anatomy 1 and 2 math)that way you can get both worlds.there are meds for anxiety problems,that might help you deal with large classes.in nursing you work with large scale nursing classes and later patients.(you must train in large scale hospital)will your anxiety bother you then.the final decision is yours,but i'd talk to my parents,guidance counselor etc to get their input.sounds like you are afraid to break that family tradition. nursing maybe or not be right for you either,but always go with what makes you happy in the end.|`|VZ21gL81aa	no easy answer here. If you were my daughter/son, my advice would be to follow your heart, pursue your passion: my love will not diminish.    If you want to do the 2 year in nursing, you may be able to go on for the BSN later (your RN certification exam requires only an associates degree), and maybe even have it partially paid for.    I owuld not withdraw right now: your financial liability is 100%, and those loans do not go away. Stay in Uni for the rest of the semester, but apply to the CC for transfer.    If you were my child, that is what I would say.|`|ybaG8ABGaa	You answered your own question.

No doubt your school instructs the pupils how to master this idea.|`|N7IivTDeaa	Because the tax payer is paying for those bunch of work shys while there are people made redundant who would love to be in work.    One day of snow and they take the week off.   You wait this summer schools boasting about 98% A-level pass rate even when kids are missing out on what you thought was crucial education time.    It shows how easy the A-levels must of become.    Fricken teachers do not have a clue how the rest of society has to work. It was poxy snow fall. In Eastern Europe they would of laughed if they shut down a school for the petty fall we had.    COME ON TEACHERS GET YOUR BEHINDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOMS! You get half the year off as it is.  When I was a kid it was us who played truant now it is the teaching staff. In the early 80's we had blizzards and our school bus would still attempt to make it. These days they only got to see 10 minutes of sleet and they shut down the education system.|`|6egcoGEwaa	My opinion is all schools should shut for about 4 weeks, not catching up...I go to a private school, and cos parents r payin we ve shut literally once in like 300 years.

Where I live the snow was not at all a problem, but still most of the schools were closed.  I could easily have driven my kids the ten miles to school without any problems.    Your experience suggests that other parts of the country have had it pretty bad.  There's no point in encouraging people to put themselves in danger for the sake of one day's schooling.    I bet those people criticising teachers will be the same parents taking their kids out of school for cheap holidays later in the year.
vtW3qPZmaa	For the first one you could use Maria's letter to Malvolio (pretending to be Olivia) or the fact that Sebastian does little to dissuade Olivia that she doesn't know him.  Also Malvolio's post-letter persona could be used here... he has turned himself into what he thinks Olivia wants to see, but is that really who he is?    For the second one you could take Sir Andrew's line "I was adored once" (clearly that didn't last) or look at Maria & Sir Toby's relationship.  Clearly they go way back and only marry later in life (whether or not you think the union was a happy one is another matter).    There are lots of other good themes to pick out of the play.  You can look at the idea of being lost - Viola is lost at sea in the first scene, Olivia is mourning the loss of family members, Sebastian has lost his sister, Sir Andrew lost his original love, Malvolio ostensibly loses everything by the end of the play.    Another one is the idea of the happy ending.  Who is truly happy?  Olivia ends up with Sebastian, even though she claimed to want Cesario; Orsino gets Viola although he professes love for Olivia; Sir Toby & Maria marry, but is is a good move for them?; Sir Andrew, Malvolio & Feste are alone.    Idea of being trapped: Malvolio is physically imprisoned; Viola is trapped in her Cesario persona; Olivia has created her own prison of mourning.

The PSAT score you need to become a semi-finalist in the competition is dependent on what state you are in. The lowest semifinalist score is about 200 in Wyoming, and the highest is about 225. The average is about 215. The scores change each year, but are usually no more than +/-2.    Hope that helps!    P.S.

rNZWUxiBaa	the phrase comes from a Christian song, as well as marriage.  CHRISTIAN: it is talking about god, and how his love will never end for his people. That no matter what, god will always love you.  MARRIAGE: basically the same, just referring to a man's love for his wife. He always loves her.
IwXuWX05aa	Every time I look around (7), life grows more curious with each passing moment.  It's at the point where I won't be surprised if I see a flyin' dunkin' donut.  How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre!(3)    Usually, I don't stand on the corner talking with Pele because often Pele speaks righteous(6) and I really don't like that cause that just isn't on my interest list.  I let him jabber on faith, but when he's on a rant, I want to send a silence spell his way, you get the gist?  How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre!(3)    Now just yesterday, we were standing by Bleecker and 7th Avenue, when Pele started talking about his chevy '69.  Out of nowhere, a car came speeding down 7th, almost knocking us over the painted line.  "Heyyyyyyy, Pelllllee," I said.  "Wow! Is that a chevy '69?"(4) How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre!(3)  But that only got him talking about divine intervention and I felt my fingers and lips start itching, begging me to do a little elocution of my own.  And then, much to my surprise because of Pele's lies and the way he's lived his life, his rant changed to actions and the seeds we've sown.  How bizarre!, how bizarre, how bizarre!(3)  As we began walking down Bleecker, I saw a freshly pasted poster(5) about Bon Jovi's next tour.  It seems one just ended, but I'll have front seats, on stage, and back stage, that's for sure.  How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre!(3)  Now Pele doesn't like Bon Jovi; he doesn't like most men.  I try to explain about friendship time and time again.  But Pele won't listen, it's got to be just him.  How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre.(3)  We hit the church on the corner, and Pele wanted to stop in to say one prayer or maybe a bevy.  But then Seena drove by in her shiny new car and said, "Hey, jump into the chevy."(8)  "How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre!(3  Pele loves a chevy more than church but just as much as he loves me. I look into the chevy and what do I see?  Brother pele's in the back seat(1) with Seena and I startle them and Pele bumps his knee. So Seena just hides her eyes (2) as Pele tries to explain, but  I just walk away from them and say, "I'm free again! I'm free!"  How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre!(3)      Note:  A nasty old troll couple is following me around thumbing me down because they lack a life.      This is about as good as it's going to get with those lyrics..LOL.
lQIKWXDuaa	NO. Just add all the schools that you intend to attend on your FASFA. This is the reason why they have room for more than one school on the application. Different schools have different deadlines to have your FASFA submitted. The earlier the better so that you can meet the deadline for all the schools. You must obey your school's deadline not the federal deadline for your state. The school receives money from the FED and they prepare a financial aid package for all the students that meet their deadline and that are accepted. Your acceptance letter usually accompanies your financial aid award letter to help you decide whether or not you want to attend that particular school. If you submit it after that date they might not have any funds for you.    After you get accepted into school, go back to your FASFA and delete all the other schools.    This is what I have done for myself and my three little brothers.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes it helps you be there for that school you going if you sign then good no worries.
wG0mx1OFaa	Calm down ;). High school is great. Yeah, people may have middle school friends, but lots won't, those who do will most likely be separate from them in most classes because HS is so big, and no one ever wants to stay with the exact same friends for their whole lives, and therefore branch out and make tons of new friends. Most all of my friends and my friends' friends made most of their friends in highschool. It doesn't take long at all to find new buddies. Have fun!|`|39gjtelYaa	Um.......   usually, ppl tend to pick on the "new kids" and kids from private schools.|`|q6Vnaqlmaa	Don't worry about it. I went from a private school to a public school for high school. You will be able to make friends, probably a lot quicker than you think. Be yourself, be outgoing. Make sure you don't seem snotty or stuck up because most kids expect private schooled kids are like that. Just be humble and modest. A lot of those kids will probably want to get to know you, since new kids are always attractive the older ones.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Don't stress it out so much.

lQIKWXDuaa	The school receives money from the FED and they prepare a financial aid package for all the students that meet their deadline and that are accepted. The amount money that you receive depends on your expected family contribution which is that EFC number that kicks out after you submitted your FASFA form. The student package consist of grants, Stafford and Perkin loans. The school starts with the Stafford and then the Perkin loans. Whatever amount extra that you need you have to get a private student loan which is credit base. Your acceptance letter usually accompanies your financial aid award letter to help you decide whether or not you want to attend that particular school. If you submit your FASFA after their deadline, they might not have any funds for you.    After you get accepted into school, go back to your FASFA and delete all the other schools.    ss
deAyKj2Uaa	no.  getting your ged is certainly not free.  it is basically the same highs school courses you could have already taken had you gone to school.  but you just take these classes at a tech school instead and you need to pay the tuition.  you should call your local tech school and request to be mailed a brochure on ged classes.  you will actually end up paying more for ged classes in the long run because peoples taxes are what pays for public education.  you are responsible for paying the tuition for ged classes.  so really your taxes already paid for the education you could have had, but now you are paying for your ged classes to.|`|xBLshQx7aa	<a href="http://answersall.yim.cn" rel="nofollow">http://answersall.yim.cn</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
hEFthejvaa	i'm in electrical engineering. engineering is THE hardest major out there but if you graduate with a bachelor's (or master's if you choose) it will be very rewarding.    if you do choose to major in it, you'll have the hardest 4 years of your life. you also need logical skills (this includes a curiosity in math & science) & the workload is tedious.    on the bright side, you only need 4 years (6 years for the very few who also get a master's) of school. other hard degrees that include becoming a lawyer or doctor require more than 6 years.

I'm sure you are verrry smart, and should feel proud of yourself for re-entering the university .    As for the graduate program ?? I have no idea . I'm not at that stage in my life yet I'm a junior :)   Haha .    But comgrats on going back to university !|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	Hey, if it makes you feel better, I'll be 26 when I graduate. I feel much older than the rest of the students. I have a kid and a husband and live off-campus and only go part-time most semesters and it's kind of weird. But definitely worth doing to end up with a degree in something I love. And, really, lots of people take a couple years off from uni before going back. It's not anything to worry about. I don't think that you should feel bad.

zZxX5PXBaa	Scientifically, a watt is a unit of power, as already noted. It correlates with work done (work not in the sense of paid employment, but in the sense of energy expended to achieve somthing, such as raising a weight to a height, or raising the temperature of a liquid). It's the multiple of joules (energy) by seconds. As a unit of electrical power in particular, it's the multiple of volts and amps. So if running an appliance draws 4 amps, on a 240v supply, that means it consumes 1000 watts of power. How much useful work you get out of that varies hugely with the efficiency of the device.<br>  <br>  As such it's a rough guide to the effective power of some tools, or the brightness of electric light bulbs, or the heat of a heater, etc. There's only a very rough correlation between the wattage of a motor or bulb, and the amount of useful work or light you get from it, because so much of the power used is wasted in heat, noise, or whatever. 'I  have two elecric drills, one's a 700 watt drill, the other's a 500. But the 500 seems to drill more powerfully than the 700. It must have a more efficient motor.'<br>  <br>  'wattage' is really a rather loose term for the amount of watts. Something which is high-wattage consumes a lot of watts / power, something which is low-wattage, doesn't have / draw / use / provide much power. In a tungsten light bulb, you could say a 1000w bulb would be a high-wattage bulb, and a 40w bulb would be low-wattage. With energy saving (usually fluorescent) bulbs the amount of light per watt is different. That is to say, they're more efficient; more of the power consumed is delivered as useful light.<br>  <br>  From the use of watts to indicate the brightness of an electric light, there's a way of describing someone as 'low-wattage', i.e. not very bright, dim. 'Dennis has been with us for a year now, but he still hasn't found his way to the photocopier. He's very low-wattage. It's right beside his desk.'|`|VZBa9h2Laa	Hi,<br>  Both have the same meanings:<br>  Watt is the unit of Power. Watt is the amount of Joule (energy) that is being utilized while doing a work per second.<br>  <br>  Wattage means the amount of electricity required for operation.

gJzkKqxwaa	I think it refers to the burden that being a queen and married can have. I guess everyone wants a great husband and to be rich but they don't understand that it is just as bad as being single and a begger. A begger has more to learn from life and hardships than a queen with everything she could ever want. Maybe she would like to do everything for herself and having a feeling of achievement and being dependent of yourself rather than on a husband and a society of people who are half against you. I believe that it was said so everyone could understand that a person cannot run from problems and hardships. Life teaches alot through its lessons but going through hardships gives you more.|`|jT1UU1CUaa	She doesn't desire marriage, especially not marriage just for the sake of marriage, but more importantly not for the sake of money and/or riches.|`|3dREgrQ7aa	i'd say that she doesn't wanna get married !|`|64bTVilEaa	Umm she hates being bound to other people.

Bringing in the mask into school is against Homeland Security policy.  You would be brought up on charges of plotting a terrorist act and never hear the end of it.  Just take the mask home and never bring it in again, and stop doing stupid things.  You can only push the envelope so far in today's society before you end up doing something that will make you an outcast to all society for the next 50 years.  Once you grow up, THEN you can do stupid things again - and probably get shot by police for doing it too, but at least then people will probably come to your defense.

67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	In public speaking there's a fine line between a stand up comedy script and an opening line intended to capture the attention of your audience. The "...something I've found amazing" isn't suited for the context of the speech wheras it is reaccounting something that happened to you (that is unrelated to the topic). I would look for a different word than "amazing" because by definition, amazement is something that is overwhelmingly striking. To put it in a narrative layout or guideline, what did you find amazing? Getting pulled over by the cop? The question he asked you? The fact that you were speeding? How does it relate to you assisting your friend?    I would rewrite the opening line to more closely associate it with providing an alibi for your friend such as:    You never stop to think about the true meaning behind the old adage, "Going above and beyond" until your number is called and you must decide if going above and beyond is a thing you really want to commit yourself to. Well, last week (or whatever time frame) I was given the opportunity to show just how far above and beyond I am capable of. My friend wanted to go out with a boy her mother disapproves of and she recruited me to give her a hand in the matter. She said, "I need an alibi." I said, "I'm the girl for the job." So here I am (insert time frame) and one speeding ticket later. Little did I know that going above and beyond would cost so much money! I did however manage to accomplish the goal laid out before me as my friend and her new boyfriend are stealthily "seeing each other".

To stick up for your friend, that would mean that you would tell the boy that she is not allowed to have a boyfriend and you would stand by her side and what her mother said... you just lied for her, thats not sticking up for her.    sure... the joke sounds good, but pick another example for your story.

So I would conclude that the countries that contain more cars are more industrialized and would mean that each person has more than 1 car.  It also means that if there are more cars in one country then there is more industrialization in that country, thus more jobs.  So the car industry exceeds the telephone industry per person in one country that woudl mean they have more jobs and more money in that country.|`|LYzoDFV6aa	that those countries r more into banking and geting rich or improving transportation

Each year, when Dr. Joel visits area schools in February to commemorate National Childrens Dental Health Month, he tells the story of George Washingtons teeth, long thought to have been carved out of wood. Its amazing how this legend has survived. Heres the true story:    President Washington lost his teeth at a relatively early age. He suffered from poor dental health throughout his younger years. He had two sets of false teeth (dentures) made by the most prominent American dentist of his day, Dr. John Greenwood. They were carved from the finest hippopotamus ivory and gold. One of the sets was donated to the University of Maryland Dental School in Baltimore, the oldest dental college in the world. The dental school in turn loaned one of the dentures to the Smithsonian in 1976 for a bicentennial exhibit.

kYj0Mq2Kaa	I suggest that you try your hardest in every subject. You can study more than usual, that would always help to rise your grade. As I have no knowledge of why your grade is declining, I cannot really give you much advice. I can just say that keep to high study habits, do all of your homework and do what you are told in class. Do not slack or procrastinate. Always do your classwork, and try your best.|`|UwT0TXU6aa	if you are motivated you get good grades. if you get good grades then you get a scholarship. bad grades= less money. just think, one day you will get paid for that A or B

See, the book portrays how the Communist government in Russia came to be as a replacement for an oppressive monarchy, but it wound up being just as corrupt and oppressive as the former.  The end result is you got one group of equals, the Communist Party, and another group of equals, everybody else, and the Communist Party is very controlling, unfriendly, and oppressive in nature.|`|ID2AH1EBaa	You can easily become what you hated.

Bear in mind Physics and Maths are the most difficult A levels you can do! But of course they are very good subjects for going on to uni.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Anesthesiologist pays more (usually 3 times as much or more) but takes a lot more training.  That's 4 years of college, 4 years of med school, and 5+ years of residency - pharmacist is 4 years of college and 4 years of pharm school.  Are you sure you didn't confuse anesthesiologist with CRNA (nurse anesthesiologist)?  That doesn't take as much training (6 years), but doesn't pay as well either.
M8qLP7MLaa	That is such a hard question...    Education is knowledge in basic skills, discipline, academics, and citizenship. That's basically the text book definition.    I think that education is knowledge you get by learning. I mean, Thomas Edison had very little formal education, so I think that you can't just get education in the classrooms only. Education is knowledge, and you learn almost everyday.     I'm not sure how it contributes to who you are in the future, because even adults don't know everything. We'll all learning all the time. It's not just about the learning either, it's about how you process what you learn and what you do with the knowledge. What your learning is also important. It generally contributes a lot though. If you don't learn anything from the time your a child to when your an adult, you don't really grow. I mean you do physically, but in the end your still the same person. Without knowledge, you can't grow as a person.    I'm going to end this now before I get anymore carried away. Like I said before, this is a really hard question.

Journalism doesn't generally pay well, but there are more jobs.  The problem is that you're probably going to end up entering a pretty competitive field, based on your interests and all.  I'd suggest talking to a school guidance councilor or perhaps even calling the admissions department of the college you're attending.  If the admissions department can't help you out, I'm sure they'd be able to point you in the right direction.|`|OLSWVy5naa	your courses are pretty similar id say i liked them things before i starte university  take english lit, you can go into journalism, media, teaching or anything with that  just dont take a specific degree like BA journalism or youll be stuck, and something like english lit will be open to that anyway  or take a foundation course in art, you need that to take any art degree anyway and itll help you decide if thats what you really want

QVVafz76aa	yes Franklin did want the turkey but...<br>  <br>     At the Second Continental Congress, after the thirteen colonies voted to declare independence from Great Britain, the colonies determined they needed an official seal. So Dr. Franklin, Mr. J. Adams, and Mr. Jefferson as a committee prepared a device for a Seal of the United States of America. However, the only portion of the design accepted by the congress was the statement E pluribus unum, attributed to Thomas Jefferson.<br>  <br>     Six years and two committees later, in May of 1782, the brother of a Philadelphia naturalist provided a drawing showing an eagle displayed as the symbol of "supreme power and authority."Congress liked the drawing, so before the end of 1782, an eagle holding a bundle of arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other was accepted as the seal.The image was completed with a shield of red and white stripes covering the breast of the bird; a crest above the eagle's head, with a cluster of thirteen stars surrounded by bright rays going out to a ring of clouds; and a banner, held by the eagle in its bill, bearing the words E pluribus unum. Yet it was not until 1787 that the American bald eagle was officially adopted as the emblem of the United States. This happened only after many states had already used the eagle in their coat of arms, as New York State did in 1778. Though the official seal has undergone some modifications in the last two hundred years, the basic design is the same.<br>  <br>  So it was a group consensus that brought it about.|`|mggll8dRaa	The Second Continental Congress....!!|`|5Eh125uAaa	The Continental Congress in 1782 voted and chose the Bald Eagle as the national bird.<br>  Benjamin Franklin did want the Wild Turkey to be the national bird, but Congress decided on the Bald Eagle anyways.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

5b8c6bcd33cbf638a175fb85ad68472caa	Sylvia Plath was living Intense.  Unfortunately her sadness was also  Intense. She had severe depressions and committed suicide.  But her writing was very deeply grounded. If you read her poems, the  poems are more touching when you also know something about her life.|`|EIzs2OWeaa	Sylvia Plath (October 27, 1932  February 11, 1963) was an American poet, novelist and short story writer.    Known primarily for her poetry, Plath also wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, The Bell Jar, under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas. The book's protagonist, Esther Greenwood, is a bright, ambitious student at Smith College who begins to experience a mental breakdown while interning for a fashion magazine in New York. The plot parallels Plath's experience interning at Mademoiselle magazine and subsequent mental breakdown and suicide attempt.    Along with Anne Sexton, Plath is credited with advancing the genre of confessional poetry initiated by Robert Lowell and W. D. Snodgrass.  [edit] Biography    [edit] Childhood  Plath was born during the Great Depression on October 27, 1932 in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to Aurelia Schober Plath, a first-generation American of Austrian descent, and Otto Emile Plath, an immigrant from Grabow, Germany. Plath's father was a professor of zoology and German at Boston University and author of a book about bumblebees.[1] Plath's mother was approximately twenty-one years younger than her husband.[1]    In April 1935, Plath's brother Warren was born.[2] The family moved to Winthrop, Massachusetts in 1936, where Plath spent much of her childhood on Johnson Avenue. Plath was raised a Unitarian Christian and had mixed feelings toward religion throughout her life. Plath's mother, Aurelia, had grown up in Winthrop, and her maternal grandparents, the Schobers, had lived in a section of the town called Point Shirley, a location mentioned in Plath's poetry. Plath published her first poem in Winthrop, in the Boston Herald's children's section, when she was eight years old.    Otto Plath died on November 5, 1940, a week and a half after Plath's eighth birthday,[1] of complications following the amputation of a foot due to diabetes, at that time a treatable disease. He did not, however, receive proper treatment for it due to an incorrect self-diagnosis. He became ill shortly after a close friend died of lung cancer. Comparing the similarities between his friend's symptoms and his own, Otto was convinced that he too was ill with lung cancer and did not seek treatment until his diabetes had progressed too far. Otto Plath is buried in Winthrop Cemetery, where his gravestone continues to attract readers of Plath's poem "Daddy." Aurelia Plath then moved her children and her parents to 26 Elmwood Road, Wellesley, Massachusetts, in 1942.[1]      [edit] College years  Plath attended Smith College, where she dated Yale senior Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in The Bell Jar is based, contracted tuberculosis and was treated at the Ray Brook Sanatorium near Saranac Lake; while visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg in a suicidal ski run, an incident described in the novel. [3] In her junior year at Smith, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt by crawling under her house and taking an overdose of sleeping pills.[4] Details of her attempts at suicide are chronicled in her book. After her suicide attempt, Plath was briefly committed to a mental institution where she received electroconvulsive therapy.[2] Her stay at McLean Hospital was paid for by Olive Higgins Prouty, who had also funded the scholarship awarded to Plath to attend Smith.    During the summer after her third year of college, Plath was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was not at all what she had hoped it would be, beginning within her a seemingly downward spiral in her outlook on herself and life in general. Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar. Plath seemed to make an acceptable recovery and graduated from Smith with honors in 1955. She obtained a Fulbright scholarship to Cambridge University where she continued actively writing poetry, occasionally publishing her work in the student newspaper Varsity. It was at a party given in Cambridge that she met the English poet Ted Hughes. They were married on June 16, 1956 (Bloomsday) at St George the Martyr Holborn after a short courtship.[5]  [edit] Wife, mother and poet  Plath and Hughes spent from July 1957 to October 1959 living and working in the United States, where Plath taught at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. The couple then moved to Boston where Plath audited seminars by Robert Lowell that were also attended by Anne Sexton. At this time, Plath and Hughes also met, for

AA10251481	A teaching certificate (school teacher) requires a four-year bachelors degree.    Some private/daycare "teachers" (nursery school, etc.) are hired with an associates degree.  These teachers are not certified by the state, however.    Most teacher aid positions require no degree.  However, an AA would probably be advantageous in both hiring and job performance.|`|A7miTF4taa	i thought a teachers aid was an associates degree in paraprofessional education.|`|lCtl1L3kaa	I'm not sure what the qualifications are to be a teacher's aid, but to be a teacher, you must be certified.  It requires at least a Bachelor's degree, but usually a Master's degree.  I suppose it depends on where you want to teach, and what they require.  Most public school though, I think require a Master's degree.  You can get hired with a Bachelor's degree, but you have to get your Master's within a certain amount of time.|`|RxjE3x36aa	I am a teacher and can definitely tell you that you do not have to have a Master's degree to be a teacher.  The basic requirements include a bachelors degree and passing a state certification test.  An associate in arts degree in teaching is mainly for students who would like to become teachers but start off at a 2 year community college.  These are classes that will prepare you for a 4 year degree.  Some states require teacher assistants or paraprofessionals to have a 2 year degree or a certain amount of college hours in order to qualify for an assistant position.  I would imagine that if you are planning on becoming a teacher assistant and applied for a job and you already had an associates in arts defree in teaching you would have a leg up on others applying.  GOOD LUCK!

Then, multiply each grade by the number of credits the course was worth.  Add all those up, and divide by the total number of credits you've taken.  That's your GPA.

The only problem is that the laws in various states require so many days of attendance or else the schools are supposed to fail the students.  I imagine the schools are trying to do their best to get the students to comply with the law.      You're right.  In college it is the students' responsibility to attend, but then again, neither the college nor the professors have the same repercussions as the high schools and the teachers.      Were you thinking that students shouldn't be punished, just allowed to sink or swim (pass or fail) on their own?  I guess that might work. . . or, then again, you might end up with totally overcrowded schools.  :-)

AA11879143	What's something you're really, *really* good at; something you could do in your sleep? Saying the alphabet would be hard because there aren't really any steps - you just read or recite the letters. Salad could be hard too because there are a lot of ingredients. Doing a back stroke kick would be hard because you can't demonstrate it.    Making PB&J is a good one - multiple steps, but they're all simple.     It would be kind of cute to do a topic of "How to write a 'how to' paper" You could then have steps like 1. Pick a topic. 2. Research the topic... etc|`|e1AUiH3naa	ok ok dont sweat it first take some mentos and put it in soda  or if you have a little toy car put an egg inside and drive into a wall record your results then take a new egg put it in and tie it to the toy car (this acts has a seatbelt) and again ram into a wall.

bTFgSh1Haa	Being a drama student myself, you MUST have a sheer interest in drama, because it's not all fun and games.  Drama is an extremely difficult and trying course, but it's totally worth it.  The skills you need are as follows:  - good reading ability  - memorization skills (e.g. monologues)  - clear voice  - movement ability  - rules of the stage (e.g. never turn back to audience)  - in prov skills  - and a love for all things drama    I hope all of this helped, good luck in drama class!|`|siif0K84aa	Outgoing-to be able to play different parts without being nervous  Friendly-able to connect well with others on stage  Good Actor  Emotional-able to play different parts well

yhX02yuNaa	He's our president, so I support him.  He's the president of the U.S. so we had all better get in line behind him.|`|YupMCYHlaa	You spelled it right!    Obama is far from my ideal candidate for president.  But I voted for him because I think he was the better of the two choices available to me.    I like that he is very bright, a professor at Harvard.  He is an excellent speaker, which is important to me.  He was a professor of constitutional law, so at least he knows what's in the Constitution and won't think of it as 'just a goddamned piece of paper'.    What I don't like is that he is a Democrat.  The Democrats are probably a little more honest, a little less corrupt than the Republicans, but money has become the most important thing in politics today and both parties get their money from the same places, so you can't expect their agendas to be all that different.  Obama  had like 3x as much money to spend as McCain, which makes me think he made lots of promises.  But time will tell.  So far he hasn't done anything that really got me mad.    One of Obama's biggest problems is that the Republicans will refuse to cooperate with him in any way at all.  They don't want to hand him a victory.  They are already saying outrageous things about him, and characterizing everything he does or says as the worst possible thing he could have done or said.  One problem is that if he -does- do something illegal or crooked, nobody will believe the Republicans.  That was true with Bill Clinton too.|`|7jwks4Nyaa	he is the best pres in the usa
i5tOQGgFaa	Like already suggested, paint with them.  But I also like to put them at the fine motor center and "write"...just like the "old days".  You can get a picture of a quill and ink bottle ...maybe read a story that takes place at this time, etc.    Tape different colored feathers on a individual boxes and do a color sort.    Have styrofoam blocks and place a tactile number or write with permanent marker the numbers 0-5 or 10 depending on ability.  Have them place the corresponding number of feathers in each block. You can have the holes there already to help them "self-check" especially with the 2 year olds.    Feathers on a parachute are always fun.  :-)  Messy but they don't usually have a problem cleaning them up here.      Introduce the term "float" and use feathers as one of the objects.  Have them predict first and write their predictions on a chart.    Make a simple bird craft...gluing on feathers.    Measure the children...objects.  How many feathers long is Kayla?  Write it on a chart/make a graph.    Edit:   We build our focus letter...you could build a F with feathers or glue feathers onto a block letter F or write/paint with feathers on a block letter Ff.    We've fringe cut a simple feather..first cutting out a simple feather out of construction paper and then snip cutting all the way around it.    You could sort animals by which has feathers and which don't... include penguins...and you can discuss how penguins are birds but can't fly...ostriches...etc.  Good luck.|`|WwcUHjeMaa	Make masks, crowns, etc.   A game:    Try the Feather Face-Off Game to answer this question: Is soft still soft if you can't see what is touching you? This easy indoor game for kids may work well as a quiet or cool-down activity.      What You'll Need:     Feathers   Cloth   Cotton balls   Anything extremely soft to the touch   Blindfold     Step 1: Have two players face each other, one blindfolded and the other with a variety of soft objects within reach.     Step 2: The sighted player brushes the soft objects, one by one, across the blindfolded player's cheek. The player with the objects has to handle them so carefully that the other player can't tell which is which.      Step 3: The blindfolded player guesses when the object is being brushed across his or her cheek is the feather, rather than another soft object.     Step 4: When the blindfolded player guesses correctly, the two players switch places.      Remember, the gentler the pressure, the harder it is to tell what's touching you. Working on senses (in this case, the sense of touch) can be as fun as working on muscles!    =) Hope I helped!|`|GybjVZxtaa	Indian hat or make a fun mask! Oooor make a craft birdy?

Preschool kids games are the perfect way to help children acquire new and basic skills.    There are many preschool kids games that will entertain the kids for hours.        1.Labeling Household Items  It is a popular preschool kids game that can bring a lot of fun and excitement. Label few household items such as your table, chairs and anything that you may think of. Children will get acquainted with those items gradually by seeing them round the clock around them.              2  Alphabet Scrapbook  You can create an alphabet scrapbook by using cut-outs made from catalogues and old magazines. Paste each letter on each page of the scrapbook. You can also encourage the preschooler to get involve in this activity. This ongoing exercise may run on for few weeks. Allow your child to enjoy his / her own creation.              3 Teach the Letter Order  This preschool kids game can be carried out by teaching your child the popular preschool ABC song. You can also take the help of some good games websites to help your child learn the letter order.              4 Learning Colors  If you get any free afternoon, just use the time to help your child get acquainted with various colors. Get some paintbrush, washable colors, towel and water. Allow your child to choose a color from the palate. Then paint your little ones feets and palms with the color and take prints. Giggling together and learning colors in is indeed a great fun.     Thank you!

The challenge is financing the education. LSE is located in an expensive area. There is not going to be any financial aid available, whereas if admitted to an Ivy League or similar well endowed American University and the family income is under around 200,000 per year the cost is less than a public university,  to nothing at below about 75,000/year. Also be aware that at LSE and most British Universities a student only usually studies  courses in the subject of  his major as an undergraduate. An Economics student only studies Economics. A Law student only studies Law. Law is an undergraduate course in the  UK and the degree earned is an LL.B. Most courses are year long and the academic year is split into three terms with breaks in between. Finals are held at the end of the year in June and determine the grade in the year long course.   If you want to work in Govt and eventually go into Politics, and as long as you have already lettered or will letter in a sport and have already or will  shown some leadership role in an extracurricular activity and have a certain amount of  community service, maybe you should consider applying to the Service Academies.

To an extent any such date must be arbitrary; Julius Nepos, the legitimate emperor recognized by the East Roman Empire continued to live in Salona, Dalmatia until he was assassinated in 480. Some modern historians question the relevance of this date,[3] as the Ostrogoths who succeeded considered themselves as upholders of the direct line of Roman traditions, and noting, as Gibbon did, that the Eastern Roman Empire was going from strength to strength and continued until the Fall of Constantinople on May 29, 1453. Some other notable dates are the Battle of Adrianople in 378, the death of Theodosius I in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the Rhine in 406 by Germanic tribes after the withdrawal of the troops in order to defend Italy against Alaric I (such invasions had occurred many times previously but this time it was successful), the death of Stilicho in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western army, the Sack of Rome (410), the first time in almost 800 years that the city of Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy, the death of Justinian I, the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a "fall", the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.[4] Over time many theories have been proposed on why the Empire fell, or whether indeed it fell at all.
4yq5ZrCDaa	San Diego State University has a good international business programs. I think its one of the best.    Also, note that even though Penn St. is an elite college, doesn't mean they have the best programs.    For instance, an Ivy League is good, but they still may not be the best in certain programs.    Moreover, Harvard is a great school, but the University of Michigan has one of the best engineering programs.    If an employer at an engineering business had two applicants, which one would he pick? The one that went to Harvard, but had a less stellar engineering program, or the one who went to the University of Michigan, which specializes in engineering?    The employer might pick the one with the best program, not school.

Five senses, etc.)  * My Body (bones, muscles, skin, hair)  * Introduction to Living Things (is it alive? How do you know?)  * Plants (What are seeds, what kind of plants do we eat, what do plants need to live?)  * Animals (Major types, skin coverings, food sources, etc.)  * Where do animals Live (habitats)  * Measurement (length, volume, weight, tools for each)  * What's the Matter? (What is "matter"? Solids, liquids, gas, turning matter from one state to another.)  * What's the weather? (sunny vs. stormy, how to read a thermometer, understand a weather report, what to do in weather emergencies)  * Seasons  * Planet Earth (land vs. water, shape of earth, build a model)  * Taking Care of Earth  * Farming  * Make it Move (push, pull and magnets)  * Astronomy|`|aiYPHUEWaa	I think that any science classes taught out of books during kindergarten will have a negligible effect.

lQIKWXDuaa	I filled out my FASFA form before I got into a school. I just added all  the schools that I intended to attend on my FASFA. This is the reason why they have room for more than one school on the application. Different schools have different deadlines to have your FASFA submitted. The earlier the better so that you can meet the deadline for all the schools. You must obey your school's deadline not the federal deadline for your state. The school receives money from the FED and they prepare a financial aid package for all the students that meet their deadline and that are accepted. Your acceptance letter usually accompanies your financial aid award letter to help you decide whether or not you want to attend that particular school. If you submit it after that date they might not have any funds for you.    After you get accepted into school, go back to your FASFA and delete all the other schools.    This is what I have done for myself and my three little brothers.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	I applied around mid January. I had heard back from a few schools by then (my early/rolling decisions specifically), but not all. If you're filling out the FAFSA, you can send it to a school you haven't heard back from yet.

Some make you apply at the same time you apply for acceptance.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	You must be accepted at the school before your FAFSA results will be considered and an award package assembled for you.

About 70.  Same with docs.    Both med and vet school is hard however ive heard from many that vet school is more demanding.  I have yet to see.      All in all it really depends on what exactly you want to do.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Your comparing apple and oranges. There's different branches in veterinary medicine and Human medicine. Example, a surgeon vs a primary care doctor.    ss|`|SIhxrxD3aa	Overall average will be doctors.  However, as other people have said the salary ranges are wide for both professions and do overlap.  Some veterinarians will make more than some doctors.    If you're comparing the same specialty, then the doctor will almost always make more.
HVJnQr3Haa	Okay well, I am a straight A student as well. Sometime reading through the text book helps when you didnt quite understand what the teacher was saying during the class lesson, try learning it on your own. Then if you try and answer some of your homework and you don't get some questions, then go to your teacher the next day, perhaps before school starts and ask for some help, trust me they will help you, and teachers love when students ask for some extra help.     So when ever you dont get something, ask.. it doesn't hurt too.    Then when it comes to a test don't leave it to the last night. You study a section of what is going to be on that test a little each night, don't over due it. The the night before or 2 night before review everything. Do not memorize everything, sometimes its better to figure out a way that you will remember something to your own understanding. Some times you will have to memorize simple formulas.     For example I had a religion exams i had to remember the twelve literary forms of the bible and I figured one out. It helped me and the whole class like it so they used it too.    My  Sister   Helped  Determine  L*3  P*4     The first letter remind me of what they are Myth, sermon, history, drama.   I did l*3 and p*4 to remind me that there are 3 words that start with a l list, letter, law. And 4 words that start with a P... Phrophecy, poetry, psalms, parable and proverb    When studying don't be near a loud place dont have the tv on or listen to music or go on the computer|`|W0RXZyGXaa	honestly middle school means absolutely nothing believe me i got all A's in middle school and when i got to high school it all changed so honestly dont worry too much about ur middle school grades just develop good study habbits so when u get to high school and it actually matters ur grades wont go down|`|znGBUQYIaa	u should use index cards.|`|2RfIIbZHaa	only way is to come from india or anything asian :)|`|Hqan62xzaa	Spend a lot of time studying and take 10 minute intervals for every hour that you study. Good attitude because a 'B' is not acceptable.|`|b0XiSgIbaa	What I did in middle school was look at my notebook and make a study guide of all the important facts on the computer. Then I printed it, studied it for awhile, and then had my mom quiz me.  For the stuff I didn't know when she asked, I'd put a star next to it and then look at the "starred" facts the most.    hope i helped =)|`|wAjuh2YZaa	im in 7th grade too. Its just the beginning of the term so I wouldnt freak out yet. I would ask your teacher for some extra credit.|`|0QXQu5hvaa	Well, evryone always says to study, study, study. unfoortunatly, i dont study, nor do i know how to, but what really helped me me was PAYING ATTENTION! if you pay attention in class ans are good at retaining information, then just pay attention and during a test it will always come to you, but if you dont understand something, go to extra help.And for an added boost, right before you take the test, skim your notes and you will do fantasticly!, and also do your homework  *DONT FORGET! it just works for me, it may not work for you, onlly if you are GOOD AT RETAINING INFORMATION  other than that, good luck!|`|i9421OOYaa	Hey! I am in 7th grade too. My tip would probably be to study more. Try making flash cards for definitions and important facts. Memorize them! Also, reading the text book and reviewing your notes helps a lot too. Use your tracker to keep track of your home work! If your school doesn't give out free ones, then buy a planner at walmart or something. It really helps! Especially if you forget about tests a lot. Hope this helps!|`|3dREgrQ7aa	i definitely understand where you're coming from.  i get all a's, but it's mostly due to good test scores.  i'm not really one for studying, but i do listen to what's going on in class and make sure i understand everything.   doing homework is pretty important and asking your teacher if you don't understand anything. it's their job to make sure you understand, but they can't if you don't ask for help.   Also, taking notes during class may help, because when you see a question on the test you can recall writing it down and it may help you remember.   But, overall tests and quizzes are pretty important, especially in high school. In some of my classes we are solely graded on tests and quizzes, no other assignments. So it's important to study if you need to. Making flash cards is always a good way, or making your own connections to certain things to remember them.     you're obviously doing something write though. so keep it up :]|`|e1AUiH3naa	I know the felling ok well here's a no brainer notes. take notes at the end of the day you can review them with a friend or by yourself. Flashcards. Flashcards are easy to learn and convenient write info on one side then write a key word on the other. Also what i do is I think of stuff to remind me for example I know hydrogen and hellion etc. on the periodic table of elements from watching wizards of Waverly place. Extra credit helps a lot because of it I have a 100 in math class. Finally if all else falls ask if you can have an extra day to do the test|`|20l3w8S9aa	um......study???????????|`|O6iEFpreaa	uhh. do yer homework ?|`|qziVwTw6aa	study like there's no tomorroww|`|1vO70QAiaa	all you can really do is study   and just do your best there is no guarantee that you will get all As just try and do the best you can...|`|2M4vSXkqaa	I have the same feelings. I'm a bit older than you, but I try really hard to get really good grades. the best piece of advice i can give you is time management. When you have a project, start it the day you get it. you will be less stressed and do a better job on it. same thing goes for tests and quizzes, study when you are first notified and you will most likely get a better grade.    Good attitude and determination helps a great deal too!|`|AA10870669	Doing well in school is about discipline. The more you study wont only burn you out but will actually bore you. However you should set aside at least half hour to an hour for each class you have to study at home every day even if you don't have homework. That will free up time for other things latter on the evening and give you the advantage of been current with your studies. This way you will also see if you need additional help in certain subjects, remember that even gifted people need help in certain subjects.|`|mHkbbtymaa	dude, one b isnt gonna kill u just study more and stuffz|`|00pFFvyXaa	Well....you just need to study   take notes in the class  double check tests and homework  and do extra credit.|`|B8j7pA6baa	If you want to get A's then you should Revise, Revise, Revise!!!|`|ghiXastzaa	cheat|`|rygoLKr2aa	Study  Do all HW  Do all projects   Extra Credit    (BTW PROJECTS AND HW SHOULD ALL BE HANDED IN ON TIME!)|`|WB028eTDaa	Study.|`|5T1xT0Ddaa	Study more than you usually do.

e739a2c4e1e2dcb4dfddc6736311a5ceaa	No known relation. Niger (the country) was named after the Niger River. This was known (or at least suspected) in Roman times, but they did not use their word for black for it.    The actual root of the name for the river is unknown. Most theories center around the Berber word 'gher' - watercourse. The Berber roamed the desert area and in their southern extreme would have encountered (or at least heard of) the river, while at their northern extreme they would be in contact with Europeans along the North Africa coast, so they were a good bet as the source of information about the river.|`|rALqTsxBaa	The country name probably came from the Latin word.
