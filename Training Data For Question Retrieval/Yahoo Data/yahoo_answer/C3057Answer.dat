zSjBHNSFaa	There are some great websites that allow you to trade books, CD's, DVD's etc. See my profile for link to titletrader, SwapaDVD and paperbackswap. This allows you to get rid of an item you no longer want and get something you do want in return. Titletrader is awesome because you can trade books, dvd's, cd's, games and vhs tapes. So if you get rid of a book you may be able to get a dvd in exchange. Paperbackswap is only for books. SwapaDVD is only for DVDs. All three sites are great!
WhbLhZoYaa	Go on their website.  It has the menu on there.|`|uikl8g3saa	1st answerer is right but also go to nola.com for more info(be sure to add in trolley prices)

D4XWrwuaaa	You can get your credit report online instantly so you don't have to wait for it in the mail.<br>  <br>  Go to www.freecreditreport.com to get it.<br>  <br>  I bet if you made a deposit with your current gas company they would transfer your account.<br>  <br>  You should request specifics from tehm about why they won't transfer you. I know they said credit issues, but you should ask for a supervisor when you talk to them and get specifics. They are required to give specific instances of when you were late, short paid or whatever else caused the problem.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Go discuss this with your landlord. By law you must have access to utilities and they may have a defaul one that they will give you thier name. From the day you started service until now, what happend, defaul on car payments, dental payments credit cards, cell phones? You may need a co signer??? Ive never heard of refused, if your identity has been stolen, this too could cause this, sorry waht a bummer, go to the landlord, they ran a credit check on you and you passed for them, so go seek their help.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	They are required to give you specifics, unless this is about your credit report.  If they are denying you based on your credit score or history, they are not required to give you any information at all over the phone.  They are only required to send you a letter giving you a chance to get your credit report.
