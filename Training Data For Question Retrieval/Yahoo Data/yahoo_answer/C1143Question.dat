20090227083040AAerICe	Beauty & Style;Hair	V or U-shaped haircut for long hair?	I have long straight brown hair that ends at the bottom of my breasts, and a kind of squarish face shape. I usually part it slightly to the side, and it is slightly tapered in the front, which I like. I'd like my hair to be a little bit shorter but still long, and I want a V or U-shape in the back. Not an a-line cut, which is shorter in the back. I want it longer in the back and shorter in the front. I really just want more variation in length, but I don't want it to look shaggy. I tried to tell the hairdresser how I wanted it, but she said that my hair was too long, and it would look bad if I cut it that way. However, I saw someone else with the cut and it looked really good. Does anyone have any pictures of this hairstyle that I can show the hairdresser, or any other recommendations for hairstyles that would look good on me?   mainly i just don't want it to all be all one length in the back.

20090305122421AAAwmXs	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I use the proactiv sulfur mask every night cause I love it! However is it bad that I'm using it every night?	I currently started using the proactiv system. Cleanser, toner, repairing lotion. I put on the mask after the cleanser, since that's what it said in the directions. But, I'm addicted. This mask feels so good! However, I'm afraid my face is becoming too dry because of it. I have oily skin so it's not TOO dry. Nothing I can't handle. But I'm wondering if it's actually okay to use it every day? My pimples are starting to peel which is good. I mean, the scar is still there but I know it will fade overtime. As long as the pimple peels, I guess I'm okay. it's working so far but I just want other people's opinions.  I know it said 3-5 times a week to use it...

I was wondering how easy it would be to tell that they are bigger?    They aren't all into gauges, so do you think you would be able to tell just by looking at them?    As of now, the plan is to get them and wear them, I'm telling them it is the same size, but I don't want them to find out.      I know that it is a big difference in ear size, but what I want to know is if it is that noticeable to the un-educated eye.

20070105075034AA51TOH	Beauty & Style;Hair	Flat iron Vs chemical straightener?	I got my hair styled recently and it looked really cute when I left. This hair style requires my hair to be straight for it to look hott. I have nice natural wavey/curly hair that my husband adores. He says I should really think about chemically straightenening it as the chemicals may destroy the curls for good.       I teach hip hop/street funk and wanted to leave my hair down when I teach but didn't want it to get curly. Would a good quality flat iron get the job done or would chemical straightening it at a salon be best in order for it to not get curly when I sweat it up =)       Any input/advice would be greatly apreciated! Ciao.

So when I left it looked very nice, silky, bouncing and HOTT!       After a few washes at home its been looking bland and annoying       T_T       I usually wash my hair with Pantene PRO V shampoo and the Pantene (anti frizz/restoratives) conditioner, and before and after I blow dry I use DOVE serum/moisturizer, then I'd flat iron it (with a non expensive flat iron..Revlon) and it has always worked fine (before I went for my trim), Now my hair looks styled but wavy ish. Maybe since it's healthy and breathing now I should consider buying a CHI flat iron...what do you think?? Any input on my hair crisis would be greatly appreciated, thank u and Happy New Years!

Or does it even matter?       Any input would be much appreciated. Thank you and Happy Holidays!

20090227042801AAHltea	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	I think I have a problem..how do I fix this?	I look at myself in the mirror and am very judging of myself. Usually I tell myself that I need to lose weight and my face looks very normal and unspecial. My eyes are too small.There is something wrong with my nose. Things like that.       I ask people and the say I'm fine. But I want to be pretty, I have no idea but I have this fixation to be pretty...and naturally pretty..without makeup. For some reason I feel that if I put on makeup it's simply an illusion and people will think ''oh she's not as pretty as I thought,'' or ''hmm she's really just plain'' when they would see me without makeup.   I cry very often when I think about this. My sisters are good looking and when I think about it I feel like crying because I'm not good looking like them.      How can I stop this problem?

Si intende il profumo della pelle di uno che si lava regolarmente, non uno sudato e con i piedi puzzolenti.

20081103145429AA6MFCq	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why can't I accept compliments like 'You're beautiful' or 'You're pretty'?!?	I just really don't like those words. I don't like being told how I look, by anyone. It's usually on pictures, friends will leave comments like 'you're really pretty in this one ^^' or 'youre beautiful' or whatever and I'm like 'Noooooooo, dont say that >.<' and i sort of cringe. I don't like thinking of myself like that but I'm not happy with the way I look even though I should be.      I dunno why I cant just say thank you though, i just hate it. I know my friends parents usually tell them they look nice, or pretty but my parents have never said that to me, theyve had no reason to. I'm not a girly girl so i never wear make up or dresses and stuff. I hate dressing up ?? Is that maybe partly why? All my parents have ever done (especially my mum) is criticise me on everything....my weight: im not REALLY overweight, im just a stone or so more than i should be at my height...but im happy enough. My mum just keeps telling me to watch what im eating or i'll get fat, or to stop eating as much. And when we're in shops she'll insist i try on the bigger size first when i know perfectly well the usual size fits me and it makes me feel really bad :( And i dont use hair product/straighteners, i leave my hair natural and messy - how i like it. but my mum keeps comparing me to me friends and saying things like 'why dont you get your hair cut like.....? its much nicer' and stuff like that. Also, i dont follow fashion trends and im not too into shopping really but she keeps pointing out my clothes arent like everyone else ?_? really gets me down sometimes.      Plus I was bullied when i was younger for everything...my hair, my weight, my speech, my clothes....      Is that why i cant accept nice complements and always put myself down? Or am i just someone who just dont like it? :S      Really confused, help?

20081105123154AA0W9uL	Beauty & Style;Hair	Which one damaged my hair?	I have very thin, straight, fine hair, and it was perfectly healthy.  Recently, my boyfriend bought a Harley, and, while riding, I sometimes left my hair down, and sometimes wore it in a ponytail with a dew rag on.  At the same time, I started using a straightening iron with a water-based wax, as a beautician suggested I do.  She said that it would add more shine to my hair.  A couple of weeks later, I noticed my hair was getting shorter in layers and in length.  At first I thought I was crazy until I asked other people, and they agreed that it was indeed, shorter.  I lost at least 2 inches all over, then had to have an additional inch cut off, due to the damage.  Some people told me it was wind-damaged from the bike and others told me it was the iron, or combination of the wax and iron.  Anyone have any similar experiences that may help me to decipher which one ruined my hair?

20080502165452AAmWjlQ	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair colour: Glazes?	I have naturally dark brown hair with light hihglights more prominantly in the front of my hair. I love my hair colour, but it's only really noticable in daylight. I was thinking of using Joh Frieda's Luminous Hair Glaze for brunettes, just because I think it will bring out the colour and shine more.      They have 2versions one for Amber-Maple then Chestnut to Expresso. They say to use the version that is closest to your highlights so I figure that means the lighter one for me.      Do y'all think it's s good idea? I don't want to full on dye my hair because I like my colour. I just want to bring it out a little more. Have any of you used this product or similar?       http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/produ...
