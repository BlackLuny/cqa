20090307075943AAnT9rX	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are Americans so afraid of America turning into a socialistic nation?	If the economy does recover under Obama and America becomes more socialistic ... so what? The economy will be recovered and America will be in better shape than under the conservatives. It was the conservatives belief in the free market and little government oversight in the private sector that got us into this mess. I mean, how can a government let private businesses run the economy of a nation. That is just ridiculous! Greed and corruption occurs with this kind of belief. I think the conservatives just need to leave America if they do not like how its heading under Obama.

20090307081103AAPabyT	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Arkansas police and law officials?	Hello, I posted this in another topic but I was going to check here as well. I received a moving violation about 5 years ago. I paid the ticket off and forgot about it until just recently. I received a summons to court for failure to pay. I got the ticket in a small southern town. I had to take off and appear in the court. Because of the time since I received the ciatation, I no longer had proof that I paid the ticket. I had to set up a fine agreement in order to take care of the ticket plus court cost. What I do not understand is that I had to talk to a probation officer that was present in court. I was placed on probation and have to meet with this woman once a month, show her proof of my payment, and also give her $35 dollars a month until the fine is paid off. I have never done anything to the extent that would warrant supervised probation. Yes, I have gotten minor tickets when I was a teen and in my early 20's but not since, excluding the traffic violation 5 years ago. Is it legal for them to place me on supervised probation because they lost my information and I had to pay the same ticket twice? Should I have to pay someone $35 a month because the town could not keep their records in order? Or, is this just another way for the town to bring in extra money? It would be different if I were a sex offender, drug dealer, drug user, had gotten a DWI, or committed some kind of violent act but I get supervised probation because they loss my records. I am sorry to rant but I have been wronged by this department and I have no proof to show otherwise but feel that they should have been able to show that I had already paid the ticket. Has anyone ever heard of supervised probation for a ( suppossed ) unpaid fine? I know that many courts put someone on probation and overlook the fine. If they mess up, they fine comes back. I did not have this option. I was told that I was on probation for the duration of the fine agreement plus I had to pay the fine. If I paid the fine off early, which I intend to do, then the supervised probation ends when it is paid off. The problem is that I have to take off work, once a month, drive three hours and meet the probation officer. Because of family and bills, it is going to take me several months to pay the fine off plus give her an extra $35 dollars per month on top of that. I appreciate any information in helping me understand the probation.

I think someones politically inclinations should be chosen in function of what the country needs are, earlier in history a political party that was leaning more on the right was what was needed in order to make this country great      But now, we've gone too far right, we've hurt ourselves and need to go back in order to get out of this chaotic mess we've created for ourselves.       No matter which party we choose to take for, there will always be people unhappy with it but the question is not, is this party good for me but is this party good for the country ?

20090307083213AAUiPLz	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can cops give tickets if they are off duty?	Last night around 7 or 8 p.m., I was driving to Homeland and I was on a four lane road (2 ways going south, 2 ways going north). The jerk-off in front of me decides to slam on his brakes to make a right-hand turn into a neighborhood street, so I swerve into the left-hand lane and cut in front of someone, but there was enough distance to not cause anyone to have a heart attack or anything. The guy I cut in front of was driving a Red Mercury SUV (at least I think the make was Mercury from looking at the grill). I was extremely close to the person in front of me so I change lanes back to the right-hand lane and speed up a bit and then change lanes to get back in front of the ridiculously slow person (they were going 35 in a 40). I was probably going 52-55 in a 40, but only for nearly 2 to 3 seconds before I reached the stop light and stopped. I continued after it turned green and made my left-hand turn into Homeland's parking lot which was not even a block down from the stop light and find a place to park. About 5 to 6 seconds later, I spot the Mercury driver coming right around and turning in front of me, making a semi-circle and then coming back around to park in a space behind mine, but in an adjacent row of parking spaces. As he came around he glared at me and pointed at me with some weird gesture. Someone had called me right around this time and I was talking to them for a short time. I decided to stay by my truck, because the guy was just parked in that space, headlights on my rear and everything. I was afraid he was going to come over and key my truck if I left it abandoned. I got out from the driver's side, shut the door, and stood in front of it while I pretended to check my phone while I observed the guy in the SUV, being partially hidden. Then I came around and opened the door to the passenger side and leaned in and pretended to rummage through my school bag. I didn't really see what he was doing, but he was sitting there for over 3 to 4 minutes. I wish I would have kept driving so he wouldn't have been able to get my license plate number down, but at the time I wasn't thinking of that. I was thinking he was gonna damage my truck. I have a feeling he may have written down my license plate number, but he was also on the phone. Why would he take that long to write a number down? I'm not even sure if he was really a cop or not. Regardless, if I hadn't changed lanes, I would have been in a bad accident. Does anyone have an idea of what this weird guy may have done?

It would also elevate pedophiles as a special protected class – since the term "sexual orientation," which has been added to the "hate crimes" legislation, includes them in the American Psychiatric Association's definition of various "sexual orientations" (30 of these APA "sexual orientations" are listed in a fact sheet provided by the Traditional Values Coalition).

I live In North Carolina, and I heard about some kind of "concealed weapons" law or something.      I am 15 years old, and the only kind of permit I have is a Learner's Permit for a motor vehicle.      Is it illegal to carry a concealed weapon? What exactly defines a "weapon"? I carry some nun chucks in my right pocket, for protection and peace of mind, and I slide my shirt over them so that nobody can see. I also carry a 4 inch blade pocket knife in my left pocket, but I mainly use it as a tool.      I don't carry them to school, only everywhere else.      Is it only illegal if they're concealed? If I have them in plain view, does it make it legal?      Also, do the following count as weapons?   3 foot steel chain   a small claw hammer, like the ones in basic store home repair kit   An axe head attached to a chain, like one used to leash dogs      also(only if the above is illegal), what are some weapons I can carry that aren't illegal, but still viable tools of self defense?       and finally, if it is legal, what amount of force am I allowed to use to defend myself? If they threaten me, am I allowed to draw my weapon?   If not, when am I allowed to draw my weapon? Also, am I only allowed to cause pain, or can I try to incapacitate them(such as striking them in the kneecap).      I want to be able to defend myself, but I don't want to break the law.

More than 400 Canadians in the full throes of a heart attack or other cardiac emergency have been sent to the United States because no hospital can provide the lifesaving care they require here.      Most of the heart patients who have been sent south since 2003 typically show up in Ontario hospitals, where they are given clot-busting drugs. If those drugs fail to open their clogged arteries, the scramble to locate angioplasty in the United States begins…      …While other provinces have sent patients out of country – British Columbia has sent 75 pregnant women or their babies to Washington State since February, 2007 – nowhere is the problem as acute as in Ontario.       http://blog.acton.org/archives/2220-Will...

I feel so sorry for the people of Detroit and other places that are being retrained for hospital jobs. So many of these people are gullible. They are being retrained to work in hospitals and told that is new industry to get into.      This is just so wrong! This is an industry that has been ripping off its patients for years when so many people have lost their jobs to outsourcing and lost their insurance due to rising costs.      I'm telling you, when these hospitals start cutting back massively, we will feel the pain. There are so many excess workers at these places, they are not realistically run, financially.      Despite what people say, just because you are working in a hospital, taking care of patients, instead of frying a burger or fries, does not make your job any more secure. Health care is a service industry, and if there is no manufacturing industry or other powerful industry that brings outside dollars into that economy, it will get cut back. Hospitals have been thriving because they've been bankrupting people. How much longer will that continue?      Don't say I didn't warn you people...

You know who you are, you want to eliminate the entitlement programs like Medicare, Social Security, Welfare, etc, and let the free market along with charitable organizations fill in those gaps.      So my question is this:       Let's pretend that Ron Paul was elected President, along with a Congress full of Ron Pauls'. Let's say they wiped out all of the entitlement programs. For the sake of argument, let's say it is 2015 and the entitlement programs have been gone for a few years and the free market and charitable organizations are not meeting the needs of the elderly, poor, etc, as well as the government was. In fact, things are getting worse and people are starving, homeless, senior citizens are not getting healthcare, etc.      What would you do? Bring back the entitlements or let the poor starve and get sick?

I would like someone to really get to the bottom of just how many people who listen to his show actually agree with him. i can tell you with perfect honesty that, as a liberal myself, I enjoy and prefer conservative talk radio over liberal talk radio. With the exception of a couple of good lib shows, con radio is simply more entertaining.       I would much rather listen to an idiot try to defend something I disagree with using bad logic and lazy thinking than listen to an idiot try to defend something I agree with using bad logic and lazy thinking.

Of the 18 cases in February, two are confirmed as suicides and 16 others remain under investigation. About 90 percent of such pending cases typically are ruled suicides.      Seventeen of the soldiers were male; one was female. Of the deaths, 14 occurred in the U.S. and four overseas.      Last month’s numbers are higher than the previous February, when 11 soldiers’ deaths were confirmed as suicides.      This February’s number represents a slight drop from as many as 24 suicides in January. Of the January deaths, 12 have been confirmed as suicides and 12 are suspected.      The January total was the highest monthly toll for the Army in nearly 30 years.

20090307075146AA1BArn	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I SUE eBay for this?...Please help me!!!?	I'm posting my question again since the answers I got were out of the context. I need answers from people who know the laws or at least have an idea if I could sue eBay for this. Thanks a lot      Hi. Here's the thing. I won bidding for several items: some I paid for, some I did not (my fault). eBay has suspended my account for the items I won but did not pay for.      The problem is that until now, I have not yet received the shoes I paid for. I tried to contact the seller but it seemed that he had closed his email account so I would never be able to contact him anymore. He must be a scammer or something. So what I did was that a month ago, when there was still time to file a dispute, I contacted eBay but they said I could not file a dispute whilst I was a suspended user. They said they would lift the suspension if everything had been settled between me and the sellers whose items I wasn't able to pay for.       My point is: the items I paid for have nothing to do with the ones I did not. They can only punish me for the items that I failed to pay for. I paid for those shoes so I guess I have every right to get them and if I don't receive them, I have every right to file a dispute or get a refund.      SO CAN I SUE EBAY FOR NOT ALLOWING ME TO FILE A DISPUTE AND FOR NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SCAMMER WHO DUPED ME?      And one more thing, I'm not from the United States.      Additional Details   I don't owe eBay any money. Maybe only those sellers whose items I failed to pay for. But still, I don't think so because I never robbed anything from them. They might have sold their items now to other buyers and simply don't care about me anymore.      Please note that the item was expected to be shipped before the suspension happened.      if i was the seller, regardless whether the buyer paid for other sellers' items or not (which is none of my business), it would be my obligation to ship the item to the buyer if he/she paid for it.      I believe that the "what goes around comes around" thing does not apply to the real law. Even if I scammed thousands of people, I have to get the items that I paid for simply because I complied with the rules associated with those items. And technically, joy bidding is not robbery.      I really don't care if I'll need to spend more than the money I lost on eBay.

(Where they stab the baby in the back of the head before it comes out, so that it won't be considered a live baby.)      (So this is reversing George Bushes Policies? Everything was doing much better in Iraq already when Obama took office, because of the surge. [Obama had voted against the surge.])      Also Obama has talked about cutting spending for our military and having the businesses making over 250,000 spend more taxes.

After I tell people he doesn't bite they usually welcome the running dog and before long they are rubbing his belly and he is licking their hands and face. No one has ever reacted like this guy did.      It was dark and this black guy and his kid were walking in the alley being loud. I knew Mac would want to say HI when he heard the commotion and if he saw them I knew he would run up to them so i yelled to them "Hold on! Let me get the leash on the dog" When he heard that he started looking around in a panic and when he finally saw my dog he got in attack mode because my dog was running up to say HI by now. At first I was in no hurry to get the leash on because I thought the worse that would happen would be Mac jumping on him and staining his white shirt. But they guy had a bag of crap he got from the gas station and was swinging it around frantically ready to hit Mac in the face with it in a spinning fury. I screamed to him a number of times that the dog doesn't bite! He just wants to say HI! He doesn't bite! Calm down! I knew after the second hit to Macs face it wouldn't be long before Mac tries to defend himself. After hitting my dog a number of times with the bag the  black guy threw the bag at him and fell on the ground. By this point Mac did not bite him and I had the dog by the collar and was trying to hook the leash back on. The guy was still on the ground kicking the dog and flailing his arms and actually ripped the leash out of my hand. My dog was sick of being kicked and pulled away from me (which was easy since I was holding him with one hand and trying to get the leash back with the other) bit onto his jeans and the guy sat up and started hitting Mac with his arms and fists. I got Mac off the guys jeans really fast but he was still beating on my dog even though my dog was no longer trying to defend himself. My dog at this point was confused and scared. I think he didn't know why I was restraining him so the guy could just keep beating him. He pulled so hard to get away from both me and the guy and layed on his back on the hill about 10 feet away looking so pathetic and scared. I got up and ran after him and the guy ran away to the gas station to call police.      ok needless to say...is there anyway I can press charges agianst him for hitting the dog multiple times even though I told him the dog doesn't bite? And for the continued beating of my dog even after I had him by the collar and calm? I know my dog would never have bit him if he didn't hit my dog first.

20090227135235AAs7kRN	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Disclosure of a Confidential Informant in Court does the informant have recourse if disclosed?	Assume all of the following standards are met and this is purely hypothetical.      An Informant agrees to assist the police and expressly states he wants his identity to be confidential and this is acknowledged by state officials.  They catch the defendant with lots of drugs and the defendant takes it to court under and challenges the validity of the warrant on the grounds that the informant was not reliable.  Assume all standards are met in the court proceeding and its determined that the Confidential Informants identity must be disclosed because the whole case is riding on his reliability.        Here’s my question... Releasing that individuals name could potentially put him/her in great harm via retaliation in some fashion by the defendant or someone he knows.  Bare in mind there was a confidentiality agreement that was recognized.  If the courts have to disclose the confidential informant what’s done for the informant who only agreed to tell the information if it was kept confidential.        Now their live is potentially in danger since the defendant knows exactly who did him dirty.  Ok so cops put that person in witness protection... now the informant has to change their whole life around because they tried to help the police and it backfired.      The big question... would this informant have any rights civilly to sue the state... the confidentiality agreement was not held and their live has changed drastically due to the fact that their identity was forcibly disclosed.  If they can't sue what type of clause would get the state out of being civilly accountable?  You agree to keep it confidential, you don't, now your live is in danger and you have to move... how can the state not be held accountable civilly?

America was once in a worse recession than now in the early 1980's with the unemployment rate at 10%. Ronald Reagan, the good man he was, cut taxes tremendously in the private sector and pushed government out with little government oversight. The economy boomed through out the late 1980's and through out the 1990's.      Why doesn't Obama do the same? Why doesn't Obama want to cut taxes in the private sector? Does he not want the economy to recover? Does Obama not believe the Free Market is the cure to the current economic problem? It certainly worked for Ronald Reagan.

The question is who was doing this?  Who was withdrawing all this money?      "On Thursday at about 11 o'clock in the morning, the Federal Reserve noticed a tremendous drawdown of money market accounts in the United States to the tune of $550 billion, as being drawn out in the matter of an hour or two.      "The Treasury opened up its window to help. It pumped $105 billion into the system and quickly realized that they could not stem the tide. We were having an electronic run on the banks. They decided to close the operation, close down the money accounts and announce a guarantee of $250,000 per account so there wouldn't be further panic out there, and that's what actually happened."      Kanjorksi continued:      "If they had not done that, their estimation was that by 2 o'clock that afternoon, $5.5 trillion would have been drawn out of the money market system of the United States, would have collapsed the entire economy system of the United States and within 24 hours the world economy would have collapsed.      "Now we talked at that time about what would happen if that happened. It would have been the end of our economic system and our political system as we know it. And that's why when they made the point we've got to do things quickly, we did."

But, under the name of "liberalism," they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened.! "         He went on to say: "I no longer need to run as a Presidential Candidate for the Socialist Party. The Democrat Party has adopted our platform."                 "The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money."

20090307093425AAoG1R8	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Hey! what do you think about this as an abortion argument for pro-life?	During an abortion at twelve weeks, the baby will struggle to get away from the suction device, its heart rate speeds up, and while it is being dismembered, it opens its mouth as if to scream.  But some people would have you believe that the same baby that screams in pain, is not alive.  One dictionary defines life as: “the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms” a fetus is not dead, it can’t be, it has never died.  Nor is it inorganic, a look at a fetal development chart will show you that.  So what about an unborn baby is not alive? I can’t think of anything.   During pregnancy the fetus develops at an alarming rate.  At nine weeks the baby starts to move and can feel pain, by week eleven almost all of the organs are functioning.  At week thirteen the baby begins to breathe and is comforted by playing with its fist.  By week fourteen the baby can suck its thumb, in just one week it will be able to perform different facial expressions such as squint, frown, grimace ect. At week sixteen the baby begins sucking swallowing and hiccupping and by week eighteen it can cry without sound.  After nineteen weeks the baby sleeps and wakes like a newborn would and after twenty it begins to recognize familiar sounds and startles at loud noises.   One surprising bit of information is 52% of abortions take place before week nine, 25% happen between weeks nine and ten.  12% happen between the 11th and 12th week and 6% happen between the 13th & 15th week.  4% happen between the 16th & 20th week.   While four percent may sound like a negligible amount, it’s 82,200 babies in the US alone every year.

20090307092115AAV75XT	Politics & Government;Military	Why dont they forcibly export all the Palestinians to Iraq?	"After all who still today talk about the annilation of the Armenians?"      Adolf Hitler alleged to have said this on the eve of ww2.      Adolf Hitler probably thought that no one did anything or simply didnt care enough to save the Armenians from the Turkish genocide so he would be able to get away by doing the same to the European J5ws.      He was unfortunately correct. in 1918 the world indifferent and not wanting another war or simply not caring did nothing to stop the Turk from genociding the Armenians. Sure the politicians as usual made alot of noise, but thats all they did       - a bit like nowaday when all the countries make noise and protesters scream their lungs out on street demos over Palestine issue but thats all they could really do against the SECOND most powerful army on earth      Population projections show that by 2050 the ARab will outnumber the Israeli J5w by 75% due to larger birth rates- so time is on their side.      A short violent blip here and their will do no good for Israel it needs a permenant solution now as its only hope.      SO my question why dont they forcibly export all the Palestinans and settle them in Western Iraq with their Sunni Arab brethren by building train tracks to the East?      Or better still do forced marches across the unforgiving Jordanian desert and solve their problem forever?      Surely enough the world will make noise but in the long run history has often shown population expulsions to be just as effective in making peace. It has been used quite effectivly in places like Bosnia, Rwanda, India-Pakistan, oh and dont forget the Red Indian or the Aborigine?

I don't want to jeopardize my apartment, I am under section 8 and the police said that they will report me if I didn't tell them where he is .

I don't know what to do anymore this has be going on for a year now and I don't want to loose my home and children this is all I have.

We operate on a budget of about 4 trillion dollars a year, with about a half trillion in loans and 3-3.5 trillion in tax revenues. Our infrastructure is still weak, and people are still poor. Where are we going to cut costs when, even when borrowing, we're barely making it? And anyway, with the economy so messed up right now, the revenues from taxes are going to be lower than ever, which only means that we will not be able to pay any of our loans for a good few years.       So how do the Chinese and Japanese expect us to return ten trillion? Or do they? Is this just an excuse for a future war? Are we borrowing because we know we're not planning on paying it back? Are they lending us so that when we are truly broke and on the verge of collapse, they will wage war against us, on the pretense of the ten trillion dollars?

I'm 19 and studying electrical installation at college but I recently got made redundant so I don't have an apprenticeship.

So then I thought maybe I could carry it on in the army. Usually I would never have really thought about it but I think I'm physically fit enough and after looking at the infomation pack it seems like a good idea...

When I contacted the psychiatrist from 30 years ago to prove my disability started back then, I was told all my records were destroyed.  The doctor wrote up a letter; however, the social security office will not accept this, therefore, I cannot get my SSDI and medicare.  I am battling cancer and I need it.  I cannot afford to keep paying for private medical insurance.  I cannot even go to a doctor because I pay out so much per month, I also have a very high dedutible yearly.      What can I do?

20090307093055AAb4Wfd	Politics & Government;Military	What if hitler had won the war?	I tend to look at things in a different light so here's my interpretation: we tend to view this war as good vs evil but it was before everything else, a war for territory and resources. that is pretty basic of any war. Now, let's say Germany conquers Europe and the useful parts of Russia, next stop would be northern Africa and of course the middle east with it's abundance of oil. As for Japan, had they not attacked Pearl Harbor, they would have conquered Asia, and the entire Pacific. With a great deal of the world's resources conquered by these two allies, what would be left for America? America would have had no choice but to conquer all of Central and South Africa for the rest of the world's resources. the world would have become 3 blokes. I think this is why America wanted to be attacked by the Japanese, this was the only way to change public opinion about the war and to have a chance to accelerate production and exit the depression at the same time and thus becoming a superpower. America had no choice in this. If this didn't happen, maybe america would be today a regional power at best, unable to function at it's maximum output because of lack of global resources.     what does that mean for our way of life? would capitalism still rule everything? would democracy exist?    anyway this is my take on it. what is yours?

20090307101309AACbXIQ	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Should lawmakers be worried about going home when they screw over the tax payer?	Congress Friday approved enough money to keep most of the federal government running for five more days — after members of both parties objected to the proposed $410 billion budget for the rest of the year.      Efforts to pass that bill broke down as some lawmakers warned that they couldn't head home and tell constituents reeling from the economic downturn why they gave most domestic programs the 8 percent increase contained in that bill — not to mention an 11 percent boost for congressional operations.      "Do people understand the nuances of the legislative process? Probably not. But do they understand when we say the budget is going up 8 percent? Then they ask questions," said Rep. Gene Taylor , D- Miss. , who's has opposed the big increase.      Some Republicans were particularly annoyed by the inclusion of thousands of earmarks, or local projects, and were outraged that Obama administration officials who were members of Congress last year kept dozens of their own initiatives in the bill.      "They are wasteful. They should not be funded," said Sen. John McCain , R- Ariz. , of all the earmarks. McCain, President Barack Obama's opponent in last year's election, has spent the week railing against the practice.

20090307102140AA3yeKj	Politics & Government;Military	Enlisting in the military basic questions??? GI Bill, etc...?	Hi, I'm in H.S. right now and I would like to have a career in the military. I definitely want to go to college, but I've been thinking more and more about going the enlisted route for maybe 3-4 years then going to college and going to OCS(or possibly going to an academy). The branches I'm looking at the most are the Marines, Navy and Coast Guard.      I have a 4.1 GPA(probably will be 4.2 by the time I graduate) so far a 27 on the ACT(retaking). I'm not sure what kind of score I'd get ASVAB, but I'm willing to work to get a really good score. I'm also an Eagle Scout, so I'll go in as an E-3, which will be nice. How hard is it to advance? Especially for the Navy and Coast Guard, I'm leaning toward those 2 for now , I like the water.  How long will it take to get to E-4, E-5?       Now the GI Bill. How much $ would I get from it? I've heard you get like 50k from the GI Bill and your branch has another college option fund to like 40k, so that brings your total to 90k. I'm probably wrong, but could someone explain to me how much $ I'd get from the GI Bill. I know you need to serve for 3 years, how long are the Coast Guard contracts? I know the Navy's lowest is 4 years, right?      Ok, I hear about people getting bonuses to join, like 20k, 30k. Does the Coast Guard do that? I've heard they are the most selective when recruiting people, so I'm assuming no. What about the Navy? I've heard it depends on the job you get and how many years you sign up for.       What are the chances I'll get to go to the locations on my "dream sheet"? I guess it will all depend on my job, and where the Uncle needs you.       Say, I enlist in the Navy when I'm 18, serve 4 years, then go to college. Then, when I want to be an officer, I decide I want the Coast Guard. Will it be harder for me to become a CG officer because I only need 16 years for retirement and someone told me they will have to really want me.             Ok, I know a lot of these questions were random and sporadic, but thanks.
