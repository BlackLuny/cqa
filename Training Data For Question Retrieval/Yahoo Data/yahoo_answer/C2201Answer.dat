yxvglsCeaa	42$ its not to much|`|CkDNruLgaa	well is gamestop is a rip off but u will get 70-100 bucks<br>  P.S. Good chiceof picking the ps3 instead of a xbox|`|uAMUG0xaaa	I'm guessing if it's in perfect condition, you could sell it for close to the<br>  same price you got it for.|`|WL4CWO8Eaa	Most likely $80.  I know, lame.  Keep your DS kid.|`|gnsX304paa	$50-$60, I got $60 for mine.|`|U16cWUqOaa	I'd sell it cause the new ds is coming out. and its like $170. remember, you cant bring a PS3 on a plane.
AA10595247	Yes it is. You may want to back up the neighborhoods just in case you change your mind and want them later.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is go to Program Files/EA Games > The Sims 2> TSData > Res> UserData > Neighborhoods <br>  <br>  The original neighborhoods will be listed (N001, N002, N003). Click on one or all of them and select copy, then go to mydocuments/eagames/sims2/Neighborhoods and select paste to overwrite your current N001, N002, and N003 folders. This will completely reset your hoods without having to uninstall. Or you can delete the neighborhoods in your mydocuments/EAgames/Sims2/Neighborhoods folder first before you copy them from your program files folders.
HvnxG0V8aa	Yeah the actual cheat is moveObjects on or moveObjects off.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I don't think when it says error it really does anything, just that it was written wrong. I think the actual cheat is "moveobjects_on" or off depending. I think it's that but I'm not positive? It's been awhile since I've played sims sorry!|`|zpb4HU7xaa	Is it the Sims 1 or The Sims 2? If it is The Sims 1 I cant help you< but if it is The Sims 2 the cheat is Move_objects on
EVjoCpjEaa	Any character will refuse your gifts if you ignore him/her for a long time.<br>  <br>  To fix this, just talk to Vaughn for several days (without giving him a gift). Then he'll have warmed up to you, and should accept gifts again.<br>  <br>  You can also only give one gift per day.
J1elZSMUaa	O.k. The ranking system right now goes like this. The game reads your teams true skill rating and your opponents teams true skill. It then predicts which of the two of you will most likely win. If you are predicted to win and you lose, then your true skill goes down. If you are predicted to win and you do win, your true skill goes up a little bit. If you are predicted to lose and you do lose then your true skill is not affected. If you are predicted to lose and you win, then your true skill rating goes up a lot. If your match making by yourself then you better hope for a good team that can help you win. The ranking system is most likely changing though once they release the third title update for the game. There is no date on it yet. It is going to be changed to an exp. kind of thing with 99 levels. That way you rank up according to how well you did personally and not how well your team did. It takes the points you got at the end of the game and adds those onto your overall score. It is balanced though so that you can't play a respawn game like annex and get a bunch of points. Points gained from annex are worth less than points gained from warzone. Hope this helps out.|`|H15jc7YBaa	The ranking in Gears 2 is a somewhat difficult to understand. From what I know it's based off a trueskill system based off your wins and losses based on what teams you're paired up with, and I could probably fill a book with the details.<br>  <br>  In short: Win, a lot.|`|0ObDnIByaa	i think you have to keep playing matches<br>  and get lots of kills......<br>  ive ranked up before but i forgot.........
N6TnQso8aa	there is a wireless adaptor that they have or u can get a wired or plug and play kit then download the drivers for them to work when hooked up the wireless adaptor runs around like $70 but it comes with a 360 controller or you can get the adaptor for $20|`|gBjd1PtFaa	Get the wireless adapter at a game store for 20 dollars and it's a usb cord so you just plug it in your laptop and then ur able to use your xbox controller and headset.
x2hW0tqraa	Wario Land Shake It if you are hardcore, De Blob if you aren't.|`|URxNcgAaaa	de blob. It's got the same idea as mario games.
URxNcgAaaa	Both. Metallicas really good and they should have a drums part too. Im looking forward to playing battery and open window if thats on there.
qbtwhWRqaa	A working xbox with all the wires and 1 controller w/ out a hard drive is $80, controllers go for $15-20 (assuming its microsoft wireless).  I don't know what kind of hard drive you have so I couldn't tell you how much its worth but 20gigs $15-20, 60gigs $50, 120gigs 90-100<br>  <br>  if they find anything wrong with the xbox i.e. 3 rings of death but still turns on, they will buy it for $40<br>  <br>  and alot of times they do deals like last Christmas when they offered an extra 40 on both working broken|`|qgk2XJpiaa	With a 20GB harddrive, you would get around $100 for the Xbox and maybe $20 for both controllers.|`|tmBZVCGwaa	i say sell them somewhere else, selling at Gamestop is like yelling into a megaphone," I like to be ripped off!".|`|dJihrIHaaa	i got 42 dollars but i didnt have the console only the accesories and two games and two controllers.<br>   isay about 80 dollars plus the hardrive if you have it another 20 bucks
HvnxG0V8aa	You can install it on as many computers you want. There must be some other compatibility issues with your laptop.|`|lDD9QKMIaa	I LOVELOVELOVE the sims and I play it all the time and Im pretty sure that you can install into any amount of computers.
ysiE6IDjaa	You have to have the Seasons expansion pack to go fishing. You can't if you only have Pets.|`|sWKGUPziaa	This question is for Sims 2 Pets? PC? You have to go to a pond or make a pond and then you can click on the pond and choose fish with.. worm; etc. For the Sims 2 PC, you have to go to build mode, click on the landscaping/ water tool and make the pond deep enough for the fish to swim in.
XRLokZnAaa	they dont sell it<br>  <br>  i think you need a new 360<br>  :]
FbcJq0ioaa	Call of Duty: World At War<br>  Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm<br>  Battlefield: Bad Company<br>  Motorstorm: Pacific Rift<br>  Ninja Gaiden Sigma<br>  Resistance 2<br>  Bionic Commando: Rearmed (PSN)<br>  Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3 (PSN)|`|ob2VmCEgaa	get call of duty world at war|`|sJClbSHGaa	I say get The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of The Year Edition. It's well worth it, cheap, and hours upon hours of play.|`|aJ6tvOpjaa	call of duty 4 is great but also call of duty 5. the minigame after you beat the campaign mode (Nazi Zombies) is amazing and so addicting you'll just keep playing it. Rock Band is also a lot of fun. If you like first person shooters - Army of Two, Rainbow Six Las Vegas 2, or Battlefield Bad Company. Assassins Creed is amazing .
YvdFoGQ2aa	they do send you a box for you to ship it in but it is usually better to do it over the internet then over the phone. the box itself usually takes a week or so to get to your home and comes with instructions to put it together with what is sent with it. i had received one myself and couldnt figure out how to put it together so i just wrapped it the best i could and sent it out. month later my xbox came home. :)|`|IuGSePCeaa	When i called them for mine,they said they were going to send me a box and they did. You might have to wait for a week or less(maybe).|`|SBcxooLsaa	yes they do and i dont know how long i think it changes
2PGIoNUHaa	Mp5 <br>  <br>  Probably the best SMG in the game. In the hand of a skilled player, it can devestate short-medium ranged combat. Even long range. (Put an ACOG on it. If you don't believe me, I've seen/spectated games of player's owning snipers with Uzi's and other SMGs from a distance.)<br>  <br>  P90<br>  <br>  To be honest, I find it a noob gun. I mean, seriously. Hold the trigger and spray for the head. The reason most people die against players who use this gun, is because smart people would put DT perk on with steady aim. That's an automatic win. But, from a distance, in the hands of the 90% population of noobs who use this gun, I find it laughable when they are slaughtered because they can't aim farther than 20 feet.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, Mp5 is the best SMG, and arguably the best gun in the game.<br>  <br>  Only short of M40 with ACOG. (Strongest gun in the game)|`|jxpV13rTaa	you can see the comparison when you select the gun in create a class, but the p90 has increased fire rate and is less accurate. both are really good up close (p90 slightly better) but the mp5 is better with a silencer and long distance(it doesnt have good long distance, just better than the p90). i use the mp5 for  my silent class all the time, even with the silencer it can hit targets in long range|`|04KsySRWaa	Well, p90 has a larger clip but the mp5 gets the job done, personelly i think u should make a class for both|`|fUd54bcsaa	P90= Great up close, kills in a second, terrible med-long range<br>  Mp5= Great up close and at medium range. Not so good long range. Perfect gun for beginners.<br>  If your in a map say like shipment, use overkill with a P90 and maybe a shotgun.|`|bNCYRk0Eaa	mp5 all the way|`|wywfaz0waa	o ya mp5
SOEuaSjhaa	Re5.  Can't wait till March. Gonna be shooting some savages.
d34e0e4d9f69e31f438e1aaa0516f046aa	is it in RAR format?, if it is, you have to extract them under the same folder, then you'll have the iso(s) for emulation.
LlMxQhHYaa	yes u can use the wifi on the ds to connect with players around the world. if u dont have a game that works wih it get animal crossings wild world or any of the new pokemon games. its totally worth it
V803iVhraa	I think both have the average same battery life.<br>  <br>   Because the model difference of 3000 and 2000 is only the motherboard security. 3000 has a much more complex system, but i don't think it is going to drain more battery usage.<br>  <br>  But if you are going to do something else evil and stuff to your PSP, buy the 2000 before they are out of stock. <br>  <br>  Just what i think.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	The PSP 2000 has the longer battery life. The 3000 had a reduced battery life to accommodate for the motherboard change.<br>  However, it's only by 20 minutes. Not much of a difference when you get 5 hours of gaming either way.|`|wQOoiAwsaa	You can check at Dnd Game Shop for there console reviews.
u240i8FIaa	The umbra sword is the best one handed weapon in the game. It does a max of 33 damage. Other swords do more damage when they are charged, but once they run out, the max that other one handed swords do is 30 damage.|`|LhoWAWKgaa	I don't believe that there is a "best weapon" in oblivion. It should be is there a best tactic. You just need good weapons and know what to use against which creatures. Don't use an Ice sword against a frost giant you will get drilled every time. You will need to know what are the weakness of your foe. there is not any one weapon that is good against every creature. try watching how your friends and other people play, I play a lot different than my nephews do.
rjbmPrwPaa	Yes, originally it was intended to be a RTS game.  But later on they changed it to a FPS.<br>  <br>  Now they are developing "Halo Wars" which is an RTS set in the time before "Halo: Combat Evolved" (The first Halo game), in which the Spartans are leading an all out war on the Covenant.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  I'd like to point out the guy below me just copied what I said >.>.|`|V7qbMDp3aa	Yes, originally it was intended to be a RTS game. But later on they changed it to a FPS.<br>  <br>  Now they are developing "Halo Wars" which is an RTS set in the time before "Halo: Combat Evolved" (The first Halo game), in which the Spartans are leading an all out war on the Covenant.|`|jay5H38waa	Yes, it was going to be for mac.|`|SBcxooLsaa	no they made halo wars so they have a teen rated game
lFrt9Huyaa	Lets see level one. If your going to be playing Assault mostly then I suggest you get an MP5K for your second slot for sure. For your third slot I would get an M4A1 or an AK47. <br>  <br>  I play War Rock as well and I have two accounts. One is level 30 with a 1.63 Ratio and another level 24 with 1.67. Both have M134 Retails.|`|SBcxooLsaa	combat arms is better play that|`|3kyJzANIaa	1. Get a PSP<br>  2. Get SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 2<br>  3. Get Wi-FI<br>  4. Play Online<br>  5. Join My clan (its called HADOUKEN!) (it owns)<br>  6. Enjoy.<br>  <br>                             OR<br>  Try Crossfire. its better than warrock and Combat arms.<br>  <br>  Crossfire has pernament weapons not like warrock and combat arms where your weapons are expired.
lQGDV7MEaa	The site I use to download my ISO's and EBOOT's from is <a href="http://www.pspiso.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pspiso.com</a> but you have to make an account there (Like Forum Name, standard personal information, etc.). It's nothing that requires credit card or anything.<br>  And there's no viruses. It's a community-based site, so anything that is harmful is reported.<br>  <br>  To get files onto your PSP, you have to put the Memory Stick into your computer through the use of a Memory Stick Duo adapter. If you don't have am MS slot on your computer, you have to pick up a mini-USB cable, and you can put your PSP into USB Mode from [Settings] in the XMB.|`|d34e0e4d9f69e31f438e1aaa0516f046aa	it is only legitimate if you own an original copy of that game.
04KsySRWaa	Well, what most people use are capture cards that u can get online and u hook it up to ur xbox, tv and cpu and record
lQGDV7MEaa	You will get a Ponyta.<br>  The male Pokemon passes down the moves while the female Pokemon passes down the species to the offspring. It's the game's way to keep things natural (kind of like how horses have to be receiving to make a mule, i think).|`|Pw1y449Daa	When you put them in the breeding centre, you will get an egg that hatches into a male or female ponyta, with different natures. But if you give the ponyta a everstone and breed it, you have a chance of the egg hatching into a ponyta with the same nature.<br>  If the infernape knows flare blitz, and you breed it, the egg will hatch into a ponyta that knows flare blitz. But its kind of useless since when ponyta evolves into rapidash, it already knows flare blitz.|`|k60TmtZ4aa	When it comes to Pokemon, whatever the mommy is will determine what the offspring is. I remember back in my Crystal, my Jynx kept getting down with my Magmar because I never remembered to take him out of the daycare center. I had a box filled with baby Smoochums!
2jMFurDoaa	i heard New Moon is coming out in November like twilight did.<br>  <br>  (but theres so many rumors going around about the whole thing)
FoJlzQB4aa	Sorry it's a demo sorry to burst your bubble
AvnG6t4baa	Empoleon<br>  <br>  Keep training him. 4 levels from now, he will learn Drill Peck, in which you can get rid of Peck<br>  <br>  Luxray<br>  <br>  Can't say much, never really had one<br>  <br>  Staravia<br>  <br>  TRAIN HIM NOW. He will evolve in 2 lvls, and learn Brave Bird, a really good move with recoil unfrotunately<br>  <br>  Floatzel<br>  <br>  Really good moves. He really won't learn much moves after that. Razor wind and whirlpool<br>  <br>  Glameow<br>  <br>  Really need to replace it, Glameows aren't very good. Catch Palkia and replace that<br>  <br>  Pachrrisu<br>  <br>  Its average. It will learn some good moves like super fang, discharge, and last resort. You can choose to replace it with whatever you want<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Ek6Wmwk5aa	Based on my analysis...<br>  Empoleon - How about Drill Peck? you will get that when Empoleon reaches lvl 58 maybe. Since I use Infernape, try to level up Empoleon.<br>  <br>  Luxray - Replace Swagger with Rain Dance or something good.<br>  <br>  Staravia - Good, but try to replace some Flying-type moves with Normal-type moves.<br>  <br>  Floatzel - Not bad.<br>  <br>  Glameow - Not bad.<br>  <br>  Pachirisu - okay, replace it with Palkia.|`|AXn3rjEWaa	jeezs im old school.<br>  <br>  sorry i dont know what your talking about. my days come from pikachu,squirtle,gyarados,zapdos.<br>  <br>  lol|`|bWLdtkhlaa	Ok, here is what I need to tell you.<br>  1). Definitely get rid of Pachirisu. It's not a good pokemon, and Luxray is a good enough electric type to have. Replace it with a fire type.<br>  2) Floatzel is ok, but I'd personally replace it as well. Swap with Palkia?<br>  3) Glameow is also a pretty bad pokemon. You need to replace that, probably with a dragon type, like eventually get a good dragon type.<br>  4) Staravia is a good pokemon, but I need to tell you something from a good player. Never EVER teach pokemon in your main party HM moves. They are horrible, and are never any good. The only acceptable moves are fly and surf, because they are strong and have enough moves to be decent. Get rid of Defog on Staravia. <br>  5) About the HM's, the perfect pokemon to have is a bidoof/bibarel. It can learn so many different kinds of Hm's and I make it my HM pokemon for when I'm moving around. <br>  6) With Empoleon, it's good that you have it at lvl 48. I always like having my main pokemon the strongest as well. But, you need to get rid of Bubble Beam, Peck, and Aqua jet. Those are ok moves, but there are much better choices later on. I suggest drill peck, ice beam, and maybe Surf?<br>  7) For now, it's a good group. Obviously, im guessing your still in the earlier parts of the game. Eventually, you will want to get a Garchomp in your main party (extremely good dragon type).<br>  8) Definitely when you get the chance, get some pokemon from the previous versions. Blaziken, Metagross, Dragonite, and many more are all great pokemon to have for your main party.<br>  <br>  This is what I think you should do and if you need any help or more advice, just message me or e-mail me.|`|T9YYrIupaa	*I would suggest u to teach Empoleon Surf and cut Bubblebeam.Even teach Empoleon Drill Peck when he reaches lvl 52 by cutting peck.Teach ur Empoelon Ice Beam and cut Aqua Jet.<br>  <br>  *Luxray has good moves for now. But as he grows up teach him Thunder adn Rain Dance (100% accuracy for Thunder) cutting Spark and Charge.Even replace Bite with Crunch when u learn it<br>  <br>  *I would suggest to bring a Ponyta in place of Floatzel bcuz u have already have a water pokemon and no fire pokemons.Floatzel is also good for your team and it is having good attacks but if u want to replace it then replace.<br>  <br>  *Grass pokemon here instead of Glameow.Catch a Roselia evolve it and teach it Grasswhistle,/synthesis, Solarbeam, Sunny day n Weather Ball<br>  <br>  *Replace this with a Dragon pokemon.Gible or Dratini will do.Gible is avalibe at the secret area of Wayward Cave under Cycling road. Dratini is avalible after National Dex.Team Garchomp Earthquake, Dragon Claw, Dragon Pulse and Flamethrower and it will be fine<br>  <br>  <br>  Considering your stage i rate ur team 8.5/10|`|m4bNJ6Pvaa	lol i agree...back when i played pokemon it was the basic ones like pikachu, bulbasaur, charmander,squirtle, and so on<br>  <br>  wonder how they come up with all these new ones lol
OZ0DgzrJaa	Other than the fighting Rune Factory is pretty much a Harvest Moon game in every other respect.  You can get married and have a child.  The major differences are the 'caves' and the monsters.<br>  <br>  In Innocent Life, you are an android, and do not get married.

aetIlclPaa	This is the point in which you can give PvP an attempt. Assuming you play alliance, there will probably be no organization whatsoever, and you'll end up wanting to kill yourself. However, even if you're horde, you'll realize you're a warrior (one of the weakest classes in arena and BGs as of now) and you'll end up hating yourself anyways. You're better off quitting the game or becoming an RPer. Good luck.|`|aXO2IiOmaa	Nothing. Go look up Darkfall Online.|`|XHdDyij8aa	its simple. you basically have nothing else to do but arenas, and raiding.
PQy6if0Waa	No... probably not.<br>  <br>  You probably got the RRoD that indicates a power surge, which jerking the cord probably triggered a quick power jostle, you know.<br>  <br>  BUT, Just for Power Connection reassurance...<br>  You should turn your console off,<br>  Wait a minute,<br>  Completely disconnect the power cords that you tripped on (the power block and the other part that connects to the wall),<br>  Put them back together again,<br>  Wait about a minute, <br>  then begin playing again.<br>  <br>  Should be fine.|`|cMHTVMpMaa	There's also the bottom right quarter-circle RROD, along with an error screen, which is only releated to a component overheating or insufficient cooling, even while just powering up. You just might want to keep an aersol duster handy for that or use a separate cooling peripheral.|`|PFejQPb2aa	ok i just had the last straw with mine lol i got rrod 6times and i started to get pissed call up the xbox ppl now! tell them everything that happends or else itll get worse trust me thats what happened to me|`|JNN7BnLlaa	I've heard a lot of situations where this has happened to people and their sexboxes kept working for a long while after, but either way its possible that this will eventually happen anyway without provocation.|`|vSTihS5uaa	no you are ok check all your connections loose ones will cause 4 red rings its the 3 rrod to be concerned about|`|63da1f2c586ef9e69acfa98f679534e2aa	I wouldn't worry about it too much... if it happens again call Microsoft for repairs - DON'T TRY TO FIX IT YOURSELF!

UR0fgx7uaa	i just got it and it barely freezes for me.  The only problem is that it froze when i pressed start right after i exited the start menu.|`|Ogh1u0Tmaa	yeah I love my xbox and as much as I hate to say it, even though it freezes a lot and my old one got the RRoD, I still like it more than my old PS3 which I sold...stupidly, I might add, but the xbox is just so much more fun.  If xbox3 solves the hardware issues of the 360, it will be the ultimate gaming system.  But yes, the Lost and Damned freezes up for me to.|`|dBfFGr5kaa	You're not alone dude.  It's the actual Lost and Damned DLC itself that's causing the freezing, not your GTA 4 disc or your 360 .  It's ALL OVER the internet right now.  EVERYONE is having the same problem.  Try googling it, you'll see lol.  EVERYONE who downloaded it is PISSED because the **** keeps freezing......  Hopefully Rockstar will release a patch update to address this problem.  Until then, we're all **** outta luck.|`|W5togHYraa	I downloaded the lost and damned and played it for aboot 30 mins<br>  FREEZE<br>  tried it again for 2 minutes<br>  FREEZE<br>  and agian 40 minutes<br>  FREEZE.<br>  <br>  I noticed a small scratch on my gta disk and took it to gamestation who buffed it and took the scratch off. Still freezes. <br>  <br>  Advice:<br>  -Enable autosave<br>  -and bare it :)|`|iAGpZfxVaa	I'm having this problem also. Within the last few hours the game is now unplayable and will freeze within seconds upon loading.
ri03nEQgaa	You should have installed 1.6 (v1.6.19) and then v1.6-v1.61b (incremental) to have the latest version.<br>  <br>  <a href="ftp://largedownloads.ea.com/pub/patches/" rel="nofollow">ftp://largedownloads.ea.com/pub/patches/</a>
9GRj1EwOaa	its a great game with fun activities online is mediocre with long times finding players and short match types that last less than finding the game you can pimp out your cars but cant pick up hos|`|R7AYASQRaa	Hell no. It doesnt even start to compare to Grand Theft Auto 4.
63da1f2c586ef9e69acfa98f679534e2aa	You must have changed consoles - if you've done that, you have to be logged in to Xbox Live with the account you bought the maps with for them to work.
bWLdtkhlaa	Explosion....... I don't know if it's the best choice of moves in my opinion, but if you have a specific strategy concerning it, good job. Personally, i'd go with the choice band. Overall, you'd want to use explosion before everyone else obviously, and using the Quick Claw could backfire. Since it's double team, you would hit your partner as well if you move first, so Quick claw is a bad idea. Choice scarf is good, but in my opinion Choice Band is a better choice. Hope your explosion technique works for you!
evaZJkekaa	5.01M33-6. Seems like you missed a critical time gap :). I'm assuming you were asking custom firmware, though. Also, just be warned that it is a bit harder to flash themes on 5.01M33-6; Sony introduced a special encrypted file that holds all of the data to make it harder- not that it worked!|`|ORcnJWicaa	5.01m33-6
2PGIoNUHaa	One thing.<br>  <br>  Why are you buying a DELL out of all things lol? Annoying cases, hard to upgrade, and usually more expensive than most computers.<br>  <br>  I just recently built this new computer.<br>  <br>  320gig HDD, Sata<br>  Motherboard SLI ready w/ 1 PCI E, 4 PCI (8300 onboard)<br>  2 Gigs ram 800 mhz<br>  9600 GSO XFX 768mb RAM.<br>  <br>  <br>  All this and more for under 400 bucks.<br>  <br>  I run WoW at about 60-70 FPS. High.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srl" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...</a><br>  <br>  go there. Good website when you buy the computer. But I'm looking at it right now...and I must say:<br>  <br>  -You only have 1 gig of ram.<br>  <br>  Not alot, and it will take longer loading time. I'd shoot for at least 2.<br>  <br>  -Your graphics card is onboard....bad bad no no. <br>  <br>  I'd say shoot for either of the ones on the list. Both suck, but MUCH better than the onboard. Try to avoid those >.> You need video memory.<br>  <br>  <br>  For all of that, and worse, your getting a 32 bit OS...theres not much to upgrade IF you had a better computer.<br>  <br>  Btw, my computer cost less than yours, and is much better. (Just saying not trying to be offensive) <br>  <br>  I used Tigerdirect/Newegg...though by seeing the currency, maybe shipping might be a problem.<br>  <br>  I'd say you'd run WoW at about 20-30 FPS max on medium.<br>  <br>  Meaning, you'd have a hard time playing graphically intense parts of the game.|`|AA10891330	it looks like it will play it :) just adjust the graphics|`|AA12180741	you'll need to be on low settings for WoW since Integrated Intel? Graphic Media Accelerator 3100 is a rubbish graphics card you need to use ATI cards yes it will be more expensive but if you want good quality and a decent frame rate you need to pay those extra pounds.<br>  <br>  there is loads of companies that make good pcs like <a href="http://www.overclockers.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.overclockers.co.uk</a> <a href="http://www.dabs.co.uk," rel="nofollow">http://www.dabs.co.uk,</a> <a href="http://www.scan.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.scan.co.uk</a> <a href="http://www.pless.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.pless.co.uk</a> all these ive bought stuff from and they know what they are talking about.|`|5zxxQqeOaa	Yes, it will work fine. I have one just like it and it runs great for Wow/Halo 2. Also if your old computer used Microsoft, Vista is a little different when you're trying to figure out how to install addons. But it isnt to hard to figure out, good luck and happy gaming.|`|AA11932065	Well the specs of the machine looks good. but try to increase the graphics. Because on board graphics will affect the machine performance. If you can go for the 3rd option in graphics (Which is 256MB VGA card) would be very good. But the 2nd option is also will do.|`|Tzw6UsHvaa	thats good enough. It wont be the best it can be but u will be able to run it fine.|`|3DBjrmGAaa	If your laptop was playing it fine at some point, take it to a computer place and have them upgrade your video card. That helped my sons and only cost about $75 bucks.|`|TA8P2s29aa	if u want to download new games here <a href="http://kamalepatel.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://kamalepatel.blogspot.com</a>|`|IzN0nv9caa	That will run Wow. I'm not too sure about the video card so you may want to upgrade there. My desktop only has 1024 Mb ram and I can play but I have serious lag problems in the big cities and instances (especially raids). I am also running windows XP as my OS. Vista uses more ram to run than XP so another gig of ram would definately be a big help. Your MB supports 4 GB so I would keep an eye out on Newegg.com and wait for them to have a sale on desktop memory. It depends on what ram comes in the machine as to your best option...how many ram slots? Is the gig that comes with it 2 x 512 Mb or just 1 x 1Gb stick. That looks like a nice laptop 8 ).<br>  Scott<br>  <a href="http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com</a>

OJ79IraJaa	just keep blocking his punches, counter him.  Or just keep throwing a bunch of haymakers.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Counter with a haymaker. basically wait until your opponent rears back to throw a haymaker, then block, once he's blocked he will freeze for a second. then throw your own haymaker. If you keep doing that you'll either knock him out or the ref will eventually stop the fight cause you'll have opened a cut over his eye.<br>  <br>  Also, body shots and jabs will tire a fighter out faster. <br>  <br>  But the more you block and counter, throw body shots, the faster he'll tire.

k5lfyMgNaa	in the actual store, they don't have these animals anymore, they are only online. They do have cinnamon swirl bunny and lil' bunny big ears that look similar. I like cinnamon swirl because she is bigger and prettier. <br>  <br>  If you are ordering online, choose Bunny big ears. She's very adorable and any outifit would look great on her. Plus she is bigger and cuter than tan swirl bunny.|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	You should spend your money on Contraceptives.<br>  <br>  You're going to need them.|`|uKLJYYVlaa	Get the Tan Swirl Bunny, I think it's cuter.
KAuPPyxDaa	You get an item strike if you dont pay for it. I got that once, but everything resolved in the end because it was the owner's fault not mine. It's only 20 bux so just go 4 it.|`|pPQoEddqaa	no just don't buy it, but you get negative feedback and you get a strike on your account. Your choice.|`|1dS2Etc9aa	If you contact the seller as soon as possible, he might let you off.  This does get annoying for the seller, because he or she already paid a listing fee which he cannot get back.  In your email, you might want to offer to pay a small fee (a buck will suffice) to compensate the seller for it. You can just get his paypal address and send it that way.  I really doubt after all that he'll still give you the negative comment.  Just the fact that you can also give him a negative comment will keep him from really messing with you too much anyway.|`|WFfNZ1YZaa	you can always contact the seller telling them it was a mistake|`|DEQHgdVqaa	yea, you will get negative feedback for not buying it. Not good if you want to make future purchases

There are four characters to choose from: Warriors, Bowmen, Magician, or Thief. These characters can be dressed in many different and colorful outfits.

lbgoHgDkaa	i have been a huge fan or the Soul Calibur (SC) series for a long time.  i have tried the Street Fighter (SF) series, but i find that there is not enough variety in SF or maybe it is just that there are too few characters to use.  the majority is hand-to-hand combat while in SC you have variety through out all the characters with their own fighting style and weapons.  i also favor the 8-way run that you can do in SC while SF is basically 2D.  the fighting style in SC is also a lot smoother which, to me makes it look better.<br>  <br>  but my answer is very biased.  like i said, i'm a huge fan of SC so my opinions of a SC game would be a lot more in depth than a SF game|`|62090c45c2dff067ee36d896ab2d47d4aa	Street Fighter 4 is way better that Soul Caliber 4. SF 4 may not have as many characters as SC 4 but the controls and graphics are what make SF 4 shine.

The game would have been premiered at E3 2007, and would feature connectivity with the Sly Cooper PSP game for the PlayStation Portable, which will be simultaneously released with the PlayStation 3 version. However, on June 5, 2007, IGN and other sources posted that there has yet to be any confirmation that work on these games exists, and thus this speculation may be incorrect.[2]<br>  <br>  Instead, it was announced at E3 2007 that Sucker Punch was working on a PlayStation 3 title called inFamous, a sandbox game based on a futuristic world with more photorealistic graphics, about a superhuman who must make moral choices to save or destroy Empire City. Brian Fleming of Sucker Punch Productions stated in an interview that "We're broadening ourselves a little bit, taking on some new challenges," but also noted that "I think it's extremely likely that you'll see us return to the 'Sly Cooper' franchise at some point in the future."[3]
AA10638442	Okay!  I have your answer at last! <br>  <br>  Mini uzi and sub-machine gun are both Limited Edition Tools.  They can only be 'bought' when they come up as the item listed on your homepage, provided you have the required number of members to buy them. Currently the limited edition tool is the Poison Gas Grenade.  It is 10,000 and if, for example, you have 24 members....you would be able to buy one each time you add another two members.  These are really valuable to you in fighting and so be sure to check these items for changes often.  <br>  <br>  You can't win them as 'loot'.

uwllfKQoaa	I created a fun space browser based game a I never noticed how many people were doing the same thing until I was done and trying to promote it. <a href="http://vanquishspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://vanquishspace.com</a>  <br>  <br>  The best thing is to search around and make sure what you arrive at isn't being done already. Since you said howrse I was thinking about a old PlayStation one game call monster rancher I was addicted to for a while. In that game you raised your creature, feeding it, playing with it, cure illnesses and training it. Then enter it into tournaments to make money. <br>  Maybe you could make a game that would be like that. Make an animal and take care of it and train it then battle other players online.

qbmkMWqeaa	You can unisntall it. <br>  <br>  EA's Download manager is an easy way to get patches for your games.  What that warning message meant was that if you uninstall it, your EA games won't get patches automatically...rather, you would have to download them and install them manually.<br>  <br>  Uninstall away. I have Mirror's Edge, Dead Space, Spore, the new LotR Conquest, Need For Speed, and a few others installed and no Download manager installed.  All games work fine.

NCJAvB8Baa	i have never really understood the point of stall decks. you both can't attack. do your self a favor. trash this deck and try this theme: get a bunch of level 3 normal monsters like sonic duck, dragon zombie, mad lobster, ect. throw in a gravity bind and level limit area b, messenger of peace (try 3), and a couple burden of the mighty. then add in 3 non-spell casting arena (or area wut ever its called). this deck makes you'r opponents level 4 and up monsters un use able and weakens them with burden of the mighty. while messenger of peace stops all monster with 1500 atk or more from attacking. but your non-spell casting will stop u'r normal monsters from being affected by that so ur monsters with 1700 and 1750 can still attack. add a couple of equip cards (to give ur normally weak monsters that extra atk boost) and a few burn cards (to add insult to injury) and u got ur self an annoying *** deck. tweak the structure to ur liking but keep the idea the same.

8vxohhLGaa	Do you mean when you are in the game? Like when a little message bubble appears over someone's character?<br>  <br>  If so, then it is easy: you just put an exclamation mark before you write the words that you want to appear over your character.<br>  <br>  Example:  !wow, almost just died, that was close!<br>  <br>  Not the little exclamation mark (the !) before the "wow, almost just died, that was close" ??? This will make that phrase appear over your character if you type it just like that, and in an actual game on bnet.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

jR8mclWIaa	HO trains and buildings and scenic features are the most common and are easy to find. Check out InternetTrains.com|`|ocSTh65Yaa	You could do a google search for any model train dealers, there are a lot of them.
R8Hm0dFAaa	First you probably need to decide about what scale you want. Train model sets come in various sizes, or scales, with G scale being the largest and Z scale the smallest.<br>  <br>  If you are going with a 6' x 6' layout, you probably want HO scale, N scale or Z scale, as anything larger will only allow you a very limited layout in that amount of space.<br>  <br>  Where to buy the best sets? You mainly want to stick with established brands like Lionel and Bachmann. Lionel has S scale and O scale trains, which are probably too large for you, but Bachmann has HO and N trains, which would be a good size for you.<br>  <br>  You don't have to buy online, but it's mighty convenient. You could do a google search for Bachmann model train dealers near you if you'[d rather buy from a brick & mortar store. If you want to buy online, you could do a google search for Bachmann model trains. Below, I've included a link to one online store that I can recommend, that carries Bachmann products.

Questions have been raised about early exposure to violent video games.<br>      * Many games do not offer action that requires independent thought or creativity.<br>      * Games can confuse reality and fantasy.<br>      * In many violent games, players must become more violent to win.

In the case of maple the neck is maple with the fingerboard being just the top of the neck. Call around. There are lumber yards that have specialty woods and they are not cheap. Good luck.

uSFS3BETaa	You are most likely thinking of the Stronghold Series. The first one most likely. The gameplay involves building hovels, castle walls, granaries, stockpiles, you must harvest resources and food for your villagers, you must build your own weapon shops, barracks, and armory, and you only start out with a place for your lord to stay. If your lord dies you fail the mission/game. This is a popular RTS in Germany i have come to find =D. They have come out with Stronghold Crusader and Stronghold 2 now you should pick up another copy.|`|a4LGeeI9aa	Yeah definetely Stronghold. Involves city building as well as RTS warfare.

The original ones, I'm not sure.<br>  I bought the official Sony made cable, and it works fine. Maybe you made a simple error, like plugging in the wrong color to the wrong hookup? <br>  Also, if you're using a Slim or 3000 hookup, make sure that the two joined cables are in the right places, and not mixed up between the two different red cables.<br>  I also know that there are a few cheaper brands that won't work, maybe you happened to get one of those ones.|`|2cVrdMP0aa	$

Not only is this series fun to play, it is also known for a good sci-fi based storyline.<br>  The only real cons of this series is that since its a Square-Enix game you can expect that there will be plenty of cut-scenes and dialogue, but if you're into that thing then this is the game for you.

Recommened espicially if you like online gaming.<br>  <br>  I'd also recommend you get another xbox exclusive and check out the Gears of War franchise. An excellent simgle player in both games, the online probably isnt as good as Halo 3's and does take some time to get used to however but it is REALLY fun.<br>  <br>  Those are the main ones, good games and Halo 3 and Gears of War 1 shouldnt be too expensive nowadays.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|IA1m2FDhaa	my go is for fallout 3 it takes a good second too like it but once you do youll love it cod waw is also a great war game to my opinion its the best there is i like skate 2 but dont have played at a friends house i do have one and will wait for a price drop of bought 10 dollers to get im 14 and gt is te4MKiller888 dont ask abought gt long story|`|mdWUEREqaa	Street fighter 4 is a really good game whether your looking for solo or online play. it's a classic. who doesn't like street fighter??

I wouldn't recommened call of duty 5 unless you are into world war 2 stuff. Nazi zombies is pretty fun on there though.  But if i had to pick one game for you to get, once again.

Alot of blood and alot of bullets.<br>  Cons: If you are a FPS player the third person shooter types are hard to get used to rent it 2-3 times just to try it out and get the hang of it. Theres also alot of waiting involved int he story and online modes.<br>  <br>  Rainbow 6 vegas2:<br>  Pros: Its great for online/ Every game is fair even for newer players. Theres more then one mode for multiplayer/ Xbox live. versus or Player versus player and Terrorist hunt or PvC Player versus Computer or bot. The AI system is great just like actual players except with un heightened senses.<br>  Cons: Its hard to get used to the style that most users play like. And there are some bugs.<br>  <br>  Grand theft auto 4:<br>  Pros: It has a solid story unlike most of the GTA series and its actually hard to figure out some of the missions. It is not all online based although the online population is huge. You might want to say hey im going to play single player for awhile instead of just focusing on the online or multiplayer modes.<br>  Cons: It has alot of experienced players getting matched up with newer players leading to alot of frustration and discomfort. Its hard to get used to the free aiming system that most of the GTA universe is so unbased upon. Theres very little auto aim.<br>  <br>  Battle field Bad company:<br>  Pros: Its a Battle field series and that meens great online play. It is mainly centered on the online play but the Battle field corporation finally caught on that random missions and un named characters were a bad idea and the single player mode actually has a story this time.<br>  Cons: Some of the games experience networking problems leading to lag. its hard to unlock bonuses or weapons. The single player mode is almost nothing like the online mode. <br>  <br>  Left 4 Dead:<br>  Pros: The game is full of character personality and team work. the online mode is the exact same thing as the single player. People are generally known to co operate well on the online versus or campaign mode.<br>  Cons: Its kind of an odd system of weapons and shooting/ picking up items or opening doors. It can really make you jump every once in a while/ i put this as a con for people that dont like scary games. There are some bugs that a small amount of  users take advantage of in the versus mode much like Cod4/5. But im sure they'll get patched eventually.<br>  <br>  Those are my recommendations if i left any thing out im pretty sure the other guys are gonna get you the  non shooting games.<br>  Good luck on picking. xFKAx Warlord :~D

RTKSv7w3aa	the 3rd one, just guessing by the way...|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	OK, it sounds like you have a deck idea and a theme and creatures that should work together well with some synergy.  This is good.  What we don't know is that since you can have up to 4 of any card in the deck, what would the actual deck look like, the full 60 cards with land?  This would also identify how you would probably deal with pesky enchantments if that's what your opponent plays or if he plays a burn deck, how you might react to it.  The deck idea is basically the drawing board.  Then you build the deck with what you have and try it out on about 5 different decks either in casual play or if you're confident, in tournament play, but at least play 5 games with it.  Then you'll have an idea of the strengths/weaknesses.  You should be able to create a decent sideboard for the deck or even replace some cards that have been sitting in your hand and doing nothing when you draw them.  Fine turn the deck after that with better cards and run another 5 games with that deck.  After the deck is tweaked a few times, you'll find you can change it a lot of ways, but you'll find a synergy that works for you and it'll be better.  <br>  <br>  Hope this is both encouraging and a little helpful|`|MDTj4U75aa	O.o  what the heck does this stuff even mean...

If you have the time, replace those waters with some other type to get more coverage. Milotic is especially a problem because of this, but you could probably 2KO it with a super-effective move. Spiritomb would be the first pokemon Cynthia sends out, but you can 1KO it with a powerful enough move. And Garchomp's a big problem, but you can overcome it with an ice move if your floatzel is fast enough (or some other pokemon that can withstand its large attack).

None of these prevented the game from being completed, but they did force me to restart levels from previously saved checkpoints. In several instances my soldier got stuck in the floor, and I got temporarily stuck a few times because a computer-controlled soldier had stopped in front of me, while another stopped right behind me. The most annoying glitch was that the CPU can occasionally see and shoot through walls and doors, which lead to many frustrating deaths.Call of Duty 3's visuals are great, though a problematic frame rate leaves the game looking decidedly less impressive than it does on the Xbox 360. The game, of course, looks best in high definition (the maximum resolution is 720p), but it still looks nice when viewed on a standard television display. All in all, Call of Duty on the xbox 360 is much better for you never encounter these problems on the 360 rather than the Ps3.<br>  <br>  Happy gaming!|`|d4ebbaff230e4deee3e1388a1ccbeda7aa	The Xbox 360 has better lighting, but the PS3 offers better textures. They are pretty much the same, but for personal preference I would go with Xbox 360. Gears of War, and Rainbow 6 Vegas are some excellent shooter games for the system.

eceb3733dac41acb2209ee932703be3eaa	Gears of War has a chainsaw bayonet and upon using this on an enemy their blood will not only just splatter, gush out, and spread everyone it always splatters all over your screen. You have dismemberments, corpses of your own or just humans in general everywhere and some not in whole forms either. Quite a bit of violence in this game.<br>  <br>  God of War now has quite a bit, from tearing wings off a Harpie by planting your foot in the middle of their back and ripping off the wings. Taking your chain blades and hooking them into the head of a huge, giant Hydra and violently yanking it down soon to be impaling the Hydra's head onto a ship pole and going into the mouth to retrieve a key. You should most likely enjoy the first God of War, the second I am sure would be just as bloodier. God of War I say would be the best bet for hardcore violence. Gears of War has it as well, but, well, just not as much as God of War has in violent material. But both has earned their M-Rating respectively!|`|a2bcc3847a658d6001a7d804dbcd352caa	God of War is gorrier, but Gears of War is the one I'd like to be stuck with on a rainy day.|`|7c17e4c28ec77ab45ca6899c9938e036aa	Gore would definitly go to Go of War. Not only is it more bloody but in part one there is nudity and sex. You can jump on the bed with two topless women and play a mini game that gives you experience points. The gore factor is diffrent with all the difrent enimies you fight. you rip off Madusa's head or force your blade throu a minitar's head. All great bloody fun. The game is great but plays a lot like old button crunchers. just hitting the buttons usually means you win the fight. However, Gears of War is a lot like Halo in its game play. Both are good games but I like God of War for the fact that the gore and fun factor areare a little higher.<br>  <br>  Kratos is the man!|`|90lgqhJMaa	they are both gorry in their own ways. i would have to say God of War is gorrier.

My Dad was a baker on a ship in WW2, and he gave us an electric cookie shooter.  After 30 years it still works.  If you are making one batch a manual press will do, but for lots of cookies, you will need to go electric.  Turning or squeezing cookie dough tires your arm and/or hand real fast.

7aff29b7fbf0ecfdd2147a496ed57e76aa	Theres nothing wrong with the game 'Bully' or 'Canis Canem Edit' here in the UK, while the behaviour of the protagonist should rightly be discouraged in real life, in a game violent behaviour can be a great stress reliever.<br>  <br>  The problem is when some people are unable to distinguish reality from the images they see on screen. The type of person who is violent in life is drawn to violent imagery and thereby violent games, but a liking of violent videogames doesn't mean that the gamer is violent.<br>  <br>  I myself have games that range from the totally harmless (Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon), thru' most genres to the violent (Grand Theft Auto and Canis Canem Edit) and the type of game i play depends on my mood, when stressed i play violent games as a release for that stress, when calm and peaceful i often find myself playing the more contemplative games.

Talvez los gráficos no sean mejores que los de PlayStation Portable, pero tiene una cosa muy importante JUGABILIDAD. Tampoco hay piezas de los botones que se bloqueen (recordad que había un botón tan pegado a la pantalla de la PSP que se bloqueaba, imposibilitando poder jugar más con ella). La doble pantalla, siendo una de ellas táctil le deja muchas posibilidades a la DS. <br>  ?Y quién dice que la PSP sea la única que pueda reproducir música y películas? La NDS también puede, pero con un dispositivo adicional (ay, con los japos... qué rabía me dan). Otro punto a favor de la NDS es el hecho de tener cartuchos, recordemos que la PSP con sus mini-discos muchos salían volando cual película de "La casa de las dagas (o bragas?) voladoras". En fin, también es verdad que la PSP tiene juegos más maduros, para gente más grande, aunque yo creo que Nintendo ha tomado nota y junto con Nintendo Wii intentará ponerse las pilas y mirar a un público más adulto (como ejemplo tenemos a "Red Steel", realmente bestial). Otro punto negativo de la Nintendo DS y que tampoco empa?a su conjunto son los problemas que uno tiene para conectarse con la red Wi-fi en juegos de red, en cambio PSP funciona en ese apartado técnico casi a la perfección.<br>  <br>  En definitiva, si lo que te gusta es jugar NDS tiene que ser tu elección.|`|c4a7e5cb4612345d552037de157b5277aa	En realidad la mejor es Nintendo DS.<br>  <br>  Cuando tienes que elegir entre Nintendo y Sony, Nintendo es y sera siempre la mejor eleccion.<br>  <br>  ATT. Mario.......................|`|cfcdfe515716f6f48cc7a3439a45fc07aa	PSP|`|ebc90fa1fa0f2922914049ea34865554aa	Nintendo DS, aunque gráficamente está muy por detrás de Psp, los juegos de DS son más originales, se están proliferando los juegos de inteligencia y aprendizage (el Brain Training, o el english training), y estamos en una época en que la potencia gráfica ya no destaca a una consola, como lo va a demostrar también Nintendo Wii. <br>  <br>  Y el punto más desfavorable contra Psp es el stick analógico, que es pésimo.

Once you beat it, all your guys will be unlocked. It takes time and patience, and trust me the last boss is really hard.

SNDE9gyVaa	Okay, alot of ppl have been saying Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles stinks...though I've never played it. I didn't pick it up because they named the Rasengan "Power Strike" and I couldn't stand it. I picked up Naruto Ultimate Ninja 2 a couple weeks back and it is awesome. I play with my bro all the time and he's 5 so he knows what to do. The controls are easy and you can custimize the jutsu... Meaning Naruto could learn Sasuke's Fireball jutsu and that goes for all the characters but no all of the teach you their justu but over half of the characters do. The storyline is great because it from the Chuunin Exams (where Orochimaru attacks the Hidden Leaf village) to the Tsunade Retrival Arc. Also an Extra story called the Gedo Mark Curse that involves Kakashi losing his sharingan and well I already spoiled enough. The storyline and RPG mode is fantastic. And Lastly, the new characters and the new jutsu make the game much better. All in all I give the game an 8.5 out of 10. Naruto Ultimate Ninja 2 is the best choice possible and if you need more convincing check out this site.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://narutoun2.namcobandaigames.com/" rel="nofollow">http://narutoun2.namcobandaigames.com/</a><br>  <br>  SO FORGET ABOUT NARUTO CRAPPY CHRONICLES AND GET THE BEST CHOICE *NARUTO ULTIMATE NINJA 2.*|`|32d77d02aeb538406b84fe231f9b3f33aa	ultimate ninja 2, becuz uzumaki chronicles is a crappy rpg game. My friend has ultimate ninja 3 in japanese and he plays it endlessly|`|UzfHyAF3aa	Naruto Ultimate Ninja 2 because it has a lot of naruto characters and lots of specials. It even has a rpg mode and 2 player's can play in the versus mode. Uzumaki Chronicles is only 1 payer, the grapchics aren't good, and the gameplay is crappy. You also only get to use a few characters.

First I'm going to tell you about the browser based MMORPGs, then I'll mention somewhere you can see the downloadable.<br>  To play games in flash, there are Dragon Fable and Adventure Quest (In both you have to pay to have full access to the game, and notice that Dragon Fable is still under construction and that it's hard for non-members to login into AQ). There are also those community based flash games (that some people consider to be MMORPGs) that are becoming really popular: Gaia Online (that I already played and that is really cool), ClubPenguin, PuzzlePirates, and i think that Habbo goes the same way; in all of this games you create an avatar and play games like fishing to get money and personalize those avatars.<br>  There’s also the pure browser based ones: Tibia is a fairly popular game, BiteFight and Knightfight are OK. Travian is a strategy MMOG, also pretty good. There’s also pokemon crater (but it has a lots of publicity) and, my personal favorite, FallenSword (it’s much like pokemoncrater, only that it doesn’t have lots of publicity, and has a guild system that stimulate interaction, not to mention the lottery and the auction system).<br>  The downloadable... well, i think it's harder to speak about them. I'll also give you a link for the "List of free MMORPGs" on wikipedia, where you can see the downloadable games out there (in this list you can read about other browser based MMORPGs as well). Take a look at the websites and check the screenshots, maybe you'll find some that interest you. My favorites are MapleStory, Anarchy Online, Monsters and Me, Flyff and Silk Road. Seems like Rappelz is also pretty good.<br>  There are also some really good free downloadable MMORPGs coming out: Sword of the new world (where you can control up to three characters at once - but you'll have to pay so that you can get over a certain level) and the global version of Lunia (it's still on closed beta, but will soon come out - keep an eye on it).<br>  See you.|`|0SEzqhGwaa	u can try<br>  <br>  www.yahooligans.com<br>  <br>  www.pokemoncrater.com<br>  <br>  www.habbo.com<br>  <br>  www.runescape.com<br>  <br>  www.battleon.com<br>  <br>  www.dragonfable.com<br>  <br>  www.catoonnetwork.com<br>  <br>  www.tppcrpg.net<br>  <br>  www.miniclip.com<br>  <br>  www.maidmarian.com<br>  <br>  www.clubpenguin.com<br>  <br>  www.neopets.com<br>  <br>  www.arcadetown.com<br>  <br>  www.yahoo.com/games<br>  <br>  for online games.<br>  <br>  U can try <br>  <br>  www.earthcam.com<br>  <br>  www.freewebs.com<br>  <br>  www.pokemon.com<br>  <br>  www.blogger.com<br>  <br>  www.bravenet.com<br>  <br>  www.youtube.com<br>  <br>  for making websites,blogs,see live webcams and watch video clips and more.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|RYhWUualaa	1.

As long as its only temporary a couple 2 to 3' by 4' plywood panels with stakes at the ends should work fine.  But like I said, pits are optional.  Just make sure no one stands to close to the pin ;-)|`|5BdKnpA2aa	No, you go to Walmart and pick it up.

wXrRhSOLaa	Many people seem to have trouble with this darned ball. Now, to get it, you don't need to go find Won. He will sell you the ball in early fall, so you don't need to worry about not buying it. Now, keeping track of the ball is pretty hard. Below are some guidelines to follow to be safe with your ball (lol!)<br>  <br>     1. Never throw the ball inside the house, it could get stuck somewhere(I speak from experience)<br>     2. Never throw the ball in the basket!<br>     3. Never throw the ball at an animal(like horses and cows)<br>     4. Never throw the ball in the shipping bin!<br>     5. Never throw the ball in the water!<br>  <br>  There we go. Those are what you should do. However, should you do one of those, you will lose your ball unless you can get it out (mine was stuck in my house table). You have two options if this happens.<br>  <br>     1. Restart the day.<br>     2. Leave it there and wait for Won to sell you another ball.<br>  <br>  To keep the ball, you can't leave it outside or anything and then go to sleep I don't believe. Just keep the ball in the cabinet in your house (you get that with I think the first house extention). Then whenever you feel like you want to play with it, you can just get it out of the cabinet and go play with your dog!|`|hO4TdoH0aa	wich version are you talking about?<br>  <a href="http://www.ultimagame.com/nintendo_ds/harvest_moon_ds/impresiones_i92_0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimagame.com/nintendo_ds/ha...</a><br>  <br>  wiki has lots of links <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(series)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hmfarm.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmfarm.com/</a>
898d2ec606a22f464e21faa9e2506ce3aa	Resident Evil for the ps1, that game creeps me out o.O|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Aquaman:  Battle for Atlantis|`|E7qtzP9Daa	Resident Evil is a classic for it's cheap thrills (zombies that pop out or loud noises, etc.) but I'll go with Silent Hill for PS1 because it has a lasting eeriness to it. The atmosphere, noises, enemies, and score are enough to make you wait until morning to play this one.|`|P7MkDJyVaa	Halo,|`|hO4TdoH0aa	what ever looks like DOOM i cant stand those its just to scary no seiing what will appear next!|`|n8e7v9jMaa	stay alive for the ps3|`|YsodlPhMaa	1 word...er...url...<a href="http://www.whatisfear.com/us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatisfear.com/us/</a>|`|h4bfJcHoaa	I would have to say Silent Hill.<br>  <br>  Sure, its an old game by today's standards, especially the one on PS1. And it doesn't give you that 'pop out scary boo' content that games like Resident Evil rely on to scare you, but only lasts a few seconds of shock before fading.<br>  <br>  A playthrough of Silent Hill will have you at least slightly freaked out through almost the entire game. Why? Its simply demented and abstract in every way. The enemies are disformed, and the game often throws you into what is a comfortable setting in real life (an elementary school, a hospital) and turns it into a hellish experience.<br>  <br>  Now, you'll argue that most horror games have creepy creatures, etc. The thing is, you never know what's next in Silent Hill. In the beginning, you are out in a nighttime setting. You see a figure in the fog, and go to follow it. You end up in an alley, and along the way, an ominous bloody stretcher is tossed aside. Eventually, you will reach the end, and be devoured by demonic children. The catch? You can't fight back. You're forced to watch in horror as you're ripped to shreds.<br>  <br>  They make an appearance early in the game, too. It scared me and most people like that; it may not be coming at you, or even a direct enemy. But you hear it, or barely see it, and its frightening. Pyramid Head is the famous character, a butcher with a giant weapon with the head of a pyramid. You don't even fight him throughout the game, but you find yourself on a quiet stairway, and you'll hear that scraping of his blade as he walks. You don't know where he is, and you can't go after him or defend yourself, but you hear it.<br>  <br>  So, basically, it keeps you on your toes. Instead of cheap horror, this game will haunt you. It gave me nightmares when other games couldn't. <br>  <br>  Plus, the deep story behind it is mindblowing. I definitely wont spoil that, just pick it up, trust me.<br>  <br>  (And play it late at night, with surround sound!) Cheers!

ObbO0xYQaa	by game, do you mean GBA/DS game, or Xbox/Wii/PS3 game? If it's a Xbox/Wii/PS3  game, then use a dick cleaner that you could get at a gamestop, best buy, or even at a glasses store. The cleaner is a soft fabric that should clean scratches a bit. If the scratches are really bad, you should get one of those kit's that you need to use a drop of a certain liquid specifically designed for disks, then also use the tray cleaner and disk cleaner that came with the kit. If its a GBA/DS kind of game, well, I don't know... Blow on it?|`|UzfHyAF3aa	Try taking a paper towel and wash it, use that paper towel to wipe the back of the cd, then take another paper towel, but this time don't wash it.

0RLcW4bHaa	Its honetly nothing to be worried about, I  used to roleplay.<br>  <br>  Its kinda hard to explain and I'm not sure if this will make sense but it's where one person portrays another.<br>  <br>  For an example lets say it was a Harry Potter RPG and I was roleplaying as Draco, I might send something like this to someone who was roleplaying as Ginny:<br>  <br>  Draco wondered the cooridors of Hogwarts aimlessly. He rounded the corner and bumped into a red-headed girl, that he recognized as Ginny Weasley. Standing up, he began dusting the dirt and dust off of his robes. "Watch where I'm going next time, you filthy blood-traitor" he snapped.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if your familiar with fan-fics (story type of thing), but roleplaying is sort-of like a fan-fic but it's acted out between two roleplayers.<br>  <br>  As I said before, its hard to explain, maybe thats why she didn't explain it. Or maybe, she's embarressed because she doesn't know what you'll think.|`|e9c5e3b2be19b116434aa0c6ce7254a3aa	Is it online? Then it is either a MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) or if she does it on a forum, that is role-playing.<br>  <br>  If it's a MMORPG, then she gets a character and goes around beating monsters up and such for currency, items, etc. in that game world... She also gets to interact with other users playing the game. One good example of a MMORPG is MapleStory (www.mapleglobal.com).<br>  <br>  However, if she's involved in a forum RP or anything of the sort, then she's basically making up a character and pretending to be that person as she makes up a story with other users on the forum.<br>  <br>  She can create a character like this:<br>  <br>  i.e.<br>  Name: Chiyako Matsuhara<br>  Age: 19<br>  Info: She's been abandoned by her family since the age of 4... Ever since then, a fighting guru trained her and taught her sword techiques... Now, she's part of a bandit group called the Lucky 7 and robs rich people. Her name is feared all throughout the country.<br>  <br>  ...And with that character, she pretends to be that character as she interacts with other peoples' characters.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped~|`|LunJwCNOaa	It depends on the context of the question.  Are you talking about good ol' tabletop RPGs, computer RPGS/MMOs?    In all cases, simply put you are playing a character in a story, similar to acting in a sense but you arguably take a more proactive approach in the "script".   A simple example:  you're in a house that's burning,   in one of the rooms there MAYBE a fire extinguisher;  but then again there may not be.  Do you leave the house to it's fate, or try & put out the fire?  Also what if there were people in the house?  <br>  <br>  Have you considered "sitting in" on a session?  That'll give you a better idea then anything any of us could write.|`|YQWerhVeaa	some popular rpg games that you might have heard of are legend of zelda or final fantasy... or newer games like oblivion<br>  <br>  o and of course for mmorpg's you have probably heard of world of warcraft, or maybe everquest, yea games like that<br>  <br>  basically it's a game where you play a character that levels up and/or chooses between various paths to take as you progress through the story... pretty simple once you know a few of them|`|rv9FCZKOaa	That's an odd question. It depends on the following:<br>  <br>  Game Based- Video games that have an extensive plot line but usually only allows one user. examples: Final Fantasy, Fable, Morrowind<br>  On-line or MMORPG - Video based game that involved people from all over the world. Examples: World of Warcraft, The later Final Fantasy Games, Guild Wars.<br>  Table-Top- Done usually with a group of people in a casual setting. This is much like the Dungeons and Dragons type games with dice and imagination. Examples: Dungeons and Dragons, White Wolf (company that produces several games)<br>  Live Action Role Play (L.A.R.P)- I did this for over a decade. It involves dressing up in a fantasy or medieval style clothing and acting on a world based in history or in fantasy. Examples: S.C.A., N.E.R.O.<br>  <br>  In all of these the basis is playing something that involves fantasy and the player/group imagination.  If she's not telling you it might be because she's embarrassed to explain it. I know most of these I have enjoyed but some of the people I was with just didn't get it.

FC0om6S5aa	No one knows how to unlock the armor yet. However, there are countless dedicated Halo 3 fans trying to solve this riddle over at Bungie's forums. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to stay up-to-date on there 380+ page thread on the Recon Armor found here: <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Forums/posts.aspx?postID=13289977" rel="nofollow">http://www.bungie.net/Forums/posts.aspx?...</a>|`|24ad88a38f298f47a414c32c8ea57754aa	The hint I saw from bungie went somethng like.... "The trigger isn't something you can control. It's not your finger that pulls it"..... I have also read that only bungie workers get it so people know its bungie... because the fact that they have groups of people that play to do "recon" on how the game is doing and what nots. But there are others who say they have it, yet I can't find anyone telling how they found it... so can you trust them? Doubtful. .... check the bungie forum... people always post on this...|`|fzJo9w6Saa	you work for bungie.(so ive heard).|`|jglUMdskaa	It has not been determined yet HOW to get the armor, however, at the time of this writing, there is ONE player with the recon armor, <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Default.aspx?player=senthra" rel="nofollow">http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Defaul...</a><br>  <br>  The Bungie employee-only armor is the flaming helmet, not the recon armor.|`|wRCYO8Efaa	Don't know for sure, but there is a large thread (and a private group devoted to it) on the Halo 3 forum on Bungie.net.<br>  One of the Bungie chaps has given some cryptic clues about how to do this.|`|P5QgZn7Paa	ANSWER: its possible for everyone to get it,its just insanely hard to get.and it hasnt been found yet.but a bungee employee leaked it has something to do with the campaign level "THE COVENANT".but like i said there are a lot of people trying tp figure it.   and im not getting mixed up with the IWHBYD skull,so dony yhink i am.

It's not very good. sorry. try a gadget deck. they are cheap, good, fast, and sometime can bring you an OTK. heres a deck list.    Monsters:  Red Gadget x3  Yellow Gadget x3  Green Gadget x3  Blue thunder T-45 x3  Cyber dragon  banisher of the radiance x2  Marshmellon  sangan  morphing jar  snipe hunter    spells:  shrink x3  Hammer shot x2  lighning vortex x2  smashing ground  Pot of avarice x2  monster reborn  brain control  scapegoat  heavy storm  Mystical space typhoon  limiter removal  Overload Fusion    Traps:  transmigration prophecy  sakuretsu armor x2  bottomless trap hole x2  Ultimate offering  trap dustshoot  torrential tribute  Mirror force    extra deck:  Chimeratech over dragon    yeah, so this deck is really really annoying. Also it can perform an OTK by 1) getting ultimate offering on the field, summoning 5 gadgets and playing limiter removal OR 2) after all of your gadgets and your cyber dragon is in the graveyard, play overload fusion to summon chimeratech over dragon with a huge attack and can attack 10 times in the same turn!|`|9BTkFgfhaa	You should only have a little of traps and spells. That way you would have enough monsters. You need weak ones and powerful ones. Make sure you have enough weak tributes for  the powerful ones. Also you need more cards to play.5/30|`|ixOE0onnaa	it does not need 1.|`|gah30viqaa	Maybe take out infernal flame emperor and add volcanic rocket.
EVDh4emTaa	I don't think you can... I'll check back to find that answer though it would be cool to know.  Sorry I couldn't help:(|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Nope, it can't be done without using a program called SimPE.  Even though I have that program on my computer, I've never tried to do it, but I think you can with that program.  If you can though, you are first going to have to download it and install it on your computer and then you are going to have to search for a tutorial which will explain how in step-by-step directions because that program is very confusing.  You really need to be a computer programmer to understand most of what it can do.  Oh, and if you are not really careful when you use that program, it can completely mess up your game.    Here's a link to get it if you want to try though:    http://sims.ambertation.de/    Otherwise, you have to have University installed.|`|1rBNZtVraa	Well the first thing have one of your sims like the other sim a lot. Then when the grim reaper comes have it plead and 99.9% chance they will get it right and they will come back to life. That is the only way I know

3OpZuIByaa	Yes, you should consider a component switcher box, a decent one, I used one one from RCA, I picked it up for 24.00 bucks at Amazon. You can put 4 component cables (HD) into the box and have one set of cables go into your tv. It enhances the signal, so you should keep the quality. People say you lose some signal either way, but I don't think it's noticable. You can always return it if not happy. IF you don't want the RCA one, do a search on component cable switch box.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You can get a HD splitter that lets you plug multiple HD cables to the splitter, and then you just adjust the switch to choose which one you want to use.  It's quite expensive though.  I think it's around 200 bucks at Best Buy.    You can usually find it in the accessories department for video games.|`|W5E8GhiBaa	Unless your tv has more than one component output, then you need a swithcher, OR you can just switch it out everytime.
