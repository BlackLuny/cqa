I was given a problem from my psych stats teacher and no matter how I look at the problem I can't figure out how she got the different SS's. The first one I get, but the second is the one I can't figure out.      Elatrix: 10, 10, 9, 1, 0, 0                               SS=132   Euphyria: 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4                               SS= 40      I understand the SS of 132, but shouldn't the second SS be 4?
20090219124603AAVPQmH	Social Science;Psychology	Guidance counselor is brutal towards me when I needed help?	Okay, I don't know what to do. There's a teacher who's harassing me, Short version of story :       Teacher made us (every student) grade eachothers people and I graded a guy's paper who was almost completely flawless and she called me a liar and lazy for not "properly" grading it. I didn't do anything wrong anyway. I did as what she said and she said I was lazy for that..... I find it really offensive and inappropriate for a teacher to call a student 'lazy' and a 'liar' and she's the one who's lazy. She's the teacher, she should be grading the papers, not us.       So anyways, today, I went to the counselor for some help and my counselor started to be completely brutal to me and say things like I change the story.... I don't know where she got that from. First, I told her the story and she kept interrupting me so obviously, she WOULD have problems understanding it when she didn't even let me finish. Then, she wants ME to TALK to the TEACHER.... Why on earth would I talk to a teacher who calls me a liar and lazy when that teacher herself falsely accuses me of things and refuses to listen when I defend myself. This counselor isn't even a counselor to start with. She was a kindergarten teacher for 9 years and this school hires her....       Anyways, please help. Idk what to do now. It seems like this no-brained counselor doesn't want to help and only want to criticize me and support the teacher because she USED to be a teacher..... Also, don't mention my parents because they abuse me and this is why I'm really sensitive not only to myself but to everyone around me.

20090219132232AAwcJVz	Social Science;Psychology	What do people think of this dream?	I had a beautiful dream. I put my arm out, and just as I did a dove came down and landed on it. It was magical. In the morning I went walking. I saw some doves. They flew towards me as if they had been the ones of my dream, but they flew over. I was a little disappointed. I wondered why there was a difference between my dream and the reality. Birds seem to know me. Many times they will fly next to my car. Even in the city pigeons will fly straight towards me then veer off to the side. Owls will be waiting at different sections along the road. You may think I am imagining this. But I know they know me.

I think the post modern view is that all values including human rights are culturally relative things.

Are there any other groups of women who should have a different set of rights? How about cultural relativism within the borders of one nation? Should muslim women be subject to Sharia law in the USA if it is part of their culture (We already have Sharia law in the UK for civil disputes)? What's your view?

But, they work 25%  LESS in hours!     http://www.bls.gov/tus/current/work.htm       Now, there is no way that women on average are 25% more efficient than men, and believing so isn't feminism-it's sexism (so it IS feminism! Lol!). less hours must thus translate to less work. This is before you factor in maternity (pregnancy compromises a worker's efficiency), danger of lawsuits, pms..... just typing this, you expect the wage gap to be even larger!       And no, they don't deserve greater pay for having vaginas. You're paid according to, you know, the value of your work? If you're a communist please say so at the beginning of your answer so I can thumb down you.

Whenever I hear any love songs/break up songs, it reminds me of him.      When I feel or see something happy, I wish he's beside me now.      If he's sick/sad or lonely, I'll always be there for him.      I will do his laundry, iron his cloth, can learn how to cook ( just for him )      He just keep lingers on my mind 24/7.      I'll do anything to make him life comfortable.      I do get angry for his nasty habits ( getting drunk ) but I still accept for what he is.      He digs his nose and fart in front of me, I still love him.      I keep reading his IM messages, SMS es over and over again.      The thoughts of him makes me happy and hurt sometimes.

Likes doing things for him, just for him.      Likes to tidy up his room.            Is this real love for a person?

A lot of my time on this board has been concentrated on countering the obnoxious male posters (who often pretend to be female. I'm keeping a list, so I know when that happens).  Consequently, I've been totally bypassing a lot of the great posts by men.  I just realized that in my rush to defend a point the other day, that I confused Furry Rapist (Tee hee.  I just got the joke.  I am literally still cracking up as I try to write this) with one of the mean guys, when he clearly isn't (really sorry. With running between my computer and whatever work I need to do, I screwed up.  I apologize)  I'd already noticed Safiri, and he is one that I've made a mental note to support (what with all of the deflecting, I am guilty of not supporting others on their questions, and answers, via thumbs up, etc, due to time constraints.  I'm working on that.)  Who are the others?  Either yourself or those you know of?  (no, you don't have to claim the title feminist.  Not having blind rage toward the movement and hating all things to the left will suffice).  I have to sign off, but I'm hoping to have a better idea when I come back on in a few hours.  Thanks!

It's not like I have choice to drop the subject because otherwise, I wouldn't ask for help here. The thing is, I hate math so bad I wish I was dead everytime I walked through that class. I think it's more of a psychology thing because I do know how to solve mathematical problems but I just don't want to.      I hated math since I was in 9th grade when my f*cked up teacher said that I shouldn't be studying there because I always failed math (I went to study in one of those elite schools). She even scolded and embarasses me in front of my class if I get the answer wrong. the worst part is, she even told the other teacher in her department that I was so stupid in math. I'm not stupid, I'm just lazy but I could learn all that if it wasn't for her stupid mouth.      Now I really don't know what to do because math subject is compulsory and I need to pass it in order to transfer to better university. Is there any easy way to learn math or any sites that could help me learn math? Please don't say I needed extra tuition because I can assure you that I will not do it.      And oh, I paid 100% attention in my math class and studied really hard. I just can't do it because of the hatred. the more I learn math and fail to solve the problems, the more I became fed up to do it. I don't wanna give up, at least not until I know I can't really do it.      Sorry for the 'essay' but I just feel that you should know everything before answering this. I appreciate for those who tried to help. And don't say that Yahoo! Answer is the last place for me to get help because this IS my last place to ask, literally. HELP!
20090220103123AAbJ0xp	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I dreamed of leaving pillows on a dirty road only to find an ancient truth at the end. What does this mean?	It began with me walking down a road. It was sunny out but everyone had thrown away all of their garbage out on the ends of their driveways. A lot of their garbage included old furniture.       Now here comes the weird part. Every now and then there would be a large, dead hog laying on it's side at the end of some of the houses. I remember feeling gross and I had pillows with me. I knew I had been instructed to lay the pillows down on the road wherever there was a dead hog that didn't have one.      After slowly walking down this road I come across one trash pile that has a desk in it. On this polished wooden desk I can hear an old woman speaking in my mind, "Make sure you give this to Ella. It's meant for her to have." I see on the desk that there are two beige books with gold trim and "Ella" engraved in gold on the top right corners. I also see three golden instruments on the desk. I'm not sure what they are but they have long stems with wand like figures on the heads.       I take the books and walk into the house's garage to read them (it's dimmer in the garage). At first it just appears to be a Bible. Then I see each book is describing a sister. I forget what the first sister is called, but I specifically reading about "The Beautiful Sister" in the second book. It shows descriptions of "The Beautiful Sister" and lists tons of secrets and things that don't exactly make too much sense to me.      The books are divided into three parts: the what, the why, and the how.      Then I wake up.      What is up in my sub-conscious??

The U.S. in debt trillions of dollars, WTF are they waiting for to pull out of the war to get some money back in the economy and can't we barrow some money from those productive countries.Yes rant I don't give a shite who doesn't agree but we have to wait years now for something big? There are more people unemployed than ever. Imagine going the rest of the year like this?

WHY DO PEOPLE BID TWICE THE AMOUNT ON AN OBJECT YOU CAN JUST BUY FOR MUCH CHEAPER?!!?!? Ok, so i bought my daughters matching dresses on ebay from some boutique seller thing. The buy it now price was $29.99 on each, plus you got free shipping if you "bought it now" But of course i tried going the cheaper route and bidding on in, well the dress price on the bidding is all the way up to $27.89 plus $6.95 shipping !! And it has 15 more hours to go!! What the hell is wrong with people...so i just went to the boutiques "store" and got it for way cheaper with free shipping, wth! people are so dumb.

20090220092840AA2IRCm	Social Science;Economics	I think i see a flaw in capitalism?	I love capitalism because it creates a high standard of living or wealth, expands our knowledge by innovation and creating amazing products and rewards those people who create those amazing products and doesn't reward failure. So that aspect is great.      However, in order for capitalism to work i think tons of money needs to be injected into the system in order to reward all these amazing products. I understand the fact that you can create wealth by trade. So a barrel of oil can be traded for 100 chickens and so forth but the actual trade doesn't compensate enough for all the trading that goes on.      We can see this by a $40 trillion debt in the medical industry. $12 trillion in social security debt and $10 trillion in federal debt in how many years?      So in other words, creating products and services is amazing but actually paying for them is the hard part. Even with all the trading going on.

My aunt said she was taking over as the baby's mother until he's 6 months old because I wouldn't be able to cope with such a young baby.        She said she was going to give him back to me when he's six months, but I that I shouldn't get too close in the meantime because if I can't cope in the end, she'd take him back off me.  I felt powerless to say no.      In real life, I'm 23 and living independently with my boyfriend.  What do you think about that dream?  Any hidden meanings?

20090203065208AAtKU83	Social Science;Economics	What do you think about my persuasive essay about the economy?	In my opinion, the top 2008 news story for me, should be A Slumping Economy. I think that this should be one of the top news story because the Economy is something the country must take-into hand and fix the main problem.       According to the 2009 Junior Scholastic “Last spring  700,000 people lost their homes to foreclosure.” This could be a big problem in the USA. Parents, have to tell their kids that its time to leave home. The United States Of America is already one of the most hated country in the world,now part of our reputation is taking homes away from the people of our country.  We’re taking homes away from thousands of people, this issue MUST be fixed with haste and accuracy.         Eventually, I started some research on what is foreclosure and what is the problem or how it can be fixed. An example of what happens when a house is foreclosed is that this may happen. “Because the banks want the houses to be ready for sale as soon as possible, John Plocher's company does what he calls "trash outs"-where they basically throw everything out”  according to PBS.Org. Soon, I began to think that, what to the people who do this feel.Sad, sorry,or nothing? With some quick research I found one comment about foreclosure that really means something. That it matters. "I have pick up their children's toys. I mean, I pick up dolls and I wonder, I wonder if this was a little girl's best friend. I wonder what this was to somebody else. And now it's going in the dumpster." - Foreclosed home cleaner”      Now, what do you think about foreclosure?I say,the Economy needs to be fixed so people should have their home.The county should fix this issue, for people losing their homes, and having a much happier country.         What would you feel if  your house said, For Sale.?

In some cases, they literally spend more time talking than breathing. I'm not kidding.      And they talk about the most meaningless things . . . every thought in their head is blurted out, no matter how trivial. It's like a twisted form of "thinking out loud", although, I don't think they actually think before they speak. "I'm hot. I'm cold. I like gum. Purple is a pretty color. I like shoes. I took a dump this morning, and it was in the shape of Elvis."      What is it with these people? Is it simply severe immaturity, or is it some sort of personality disorder?

I'm really attracted to him, he's tall, athletic, muscular and manly, and I'm only attracted to masculine things and the opposite sex. To me theres no bigger turn on than a ripped hunky guy flexing his big hairy muscular pecs... you know just manly stuff. But I occasionally dream of women...I did this morning. I hate it, I dont understand why. I don't want to get into the details of my dream because it disgusts me. I'm not attracted to the same sex at all, I feel nothing towards the same sex, its a turn off for me, and I wake up feeling so grossed out and crappy. If I'm attracted to men why do I occasionally dream of women? If I had a choice I would choose to stop dreaming about women altogether, but I can't control my dreams. Is this normal? Has this ever happened to you?       Please no childish answers, and no answers like "youre subconscially gay" because I know for sure I am straight. Thankyou.
