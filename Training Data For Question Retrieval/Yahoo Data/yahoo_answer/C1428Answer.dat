They also discovered that it had relations of commerce with other civilizations, such as Mesopotamia, and the Indus.    They also discovered that it wasn't hindu. Hinduism is a modern development of Brahmanism, or Vedic Hinduism, which in turn was introduced in the indian subcontinent by the Indo-Europeans (if you accept the indo-european hypothesis, it isn't consensual); Mohenjo-daro/Harrapa wasn't a Indo-European civilization. If anything, it was dravidian, but even that is under discussion.

However, your hands probably become sweaty because your emotions are forcing your autonomous biological systems to overreact.    One way to circumvent this reaction is to focus on the realities of the present moment, rather than continually worrying about or anticipating what could happen in the future or what has happened in the past.    Focus on enjoying the moment rather than worrying about it.

Not sure you can get a lobster dinner for mere pennies anywhere, but from observation Thailand and Vietnam are very good value.    Another indicator to google is the Big Mac Index - the cheaper it is in one country, the more likely that country's currency is cheap versus the American dollar.

If you destroy the forest you will never know that there was a plant there that could cure diabetes or cancer. Instead, decades will be wasted and billions of dollars spent in researching a chemical compound that could've been simply "discovered" and mass marketed.    Another aspect is tourism, as many countries' largest source of foreign currency is tourists who come to observe a unique eco-system.
3p6wp7DYaa	It has to do with negative externalities. For the firm cutting off the trees and selling the wood, the costs of production do not reflect the true cost of deforestation to society as a whole. Think about it. The firm pays for the labor, for the machines, for gas, for administrative costs, etc. But who pays for the soil erosion that may happen in 10 years? Who will bear the costs of loss of bio-diversity, the increase in carbon dioxide, and all of the other negative externalities involved? Those are costs incurred by the society, but they are not reflected in the firm's operating costs. Since the costs appear lower than they really are, the amount of deforestation will be higher than the optimum amount to society, where costs and benefits are in balance. Market mechanisms will only reflect supply and demand forces, so they are not efficient when it comes to goods with a high amount of negative externalities.

BhumxInEaa	1. While some European countries have a higher productivity per man hour for factory workers than the U.S. does, the typical U.S. worker works more hours  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_tim...  http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/em...  More hours can compensate for lower productivity per hour.    2. Then there is the percentage of the population that is actually working. That percentage is higher in the U.S. than in Europe:  http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2006/10/art3...    3. Then there is the measure of productivity. Measuring the productivity of a factory worker is relatively easy. But for a long time, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics didn't even try to measure the productivity of service workers, even though more than half of all workers are in the service industries.    There are still many open questions of how best to measure service worker productivity. For example, how do you measure the productivity of an IT person or an economist? Since software is not valued (it is usually considered an expense), how do you evaluate the productivity of a programmer?    So it isn't at all clear that the productivity of the average worker (as opposed to the average factory worker) in the U.S. is indeed lower than in Europe.|`|k24zcshxaa	GDP is not per capita, while productivity is.

A guy doing the same thing probably would have been charged with murder.  I'm not sure the woman in question would live too long without excellent medical care around.    However, she really should have gotten something much harsher if that's really all she got.

edcf63a2538e48e384a8ae8bdea849adaa	Darwin was not an atheist but his father was draconian and constantly ridiculed him on his 'silly' science endeavors and felt he was an embarrassment to the family.     Charles thought otherwise and set him self to prove his own theory's and in doing so enlightened the science community with his empirical fact finding missions and thesis of evolution.     It is surmountable presumption to assume if not for his fathers staunch criticism and lack of faith in his boy that enabled Charles to rebuke his fathers steadfast tenancies. If his father was doting and encouraging, Charles may not have so ambitious to prove his ideological worth to his community and hence shake the pillars of his fathers faith.     But no I do not feel Charles Darwin was an atheist. He became bent on reveling what he considered to be universal truth of existence going beyond the confinements of the structured religious institutions that he felt limited understanding in his time.     Charles had mentors who helped shape his understanding and they and others in a pivotal time had ambitions to break loose from the tyrannical bonds the Church placed on science, hence his fathers disapproval.     Its a bit Freudian the inner conflict Charles had with his father to best him but that is getting into psychoanalysis.      I could go further into this but lets leave it to what has been stated at this time. Email me if you wish further prattle. lol.|`|qnt1wAfiaa	No, he was not an atheist. He did become an agnostic due to the death of his daughter.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	No, Darwin was a skeptic but not an atheist.

If you really research his -theory, remember, it is a theory- about evolution, you'll see how even he believed that it had holes and messy spots. I find it interesting how atheists like to use the theory of evolution as a way to disprove creation, rather than seeing how the two go hand in hand. I especially like to argue with atheists about the big bang theory and universal expansion, because both are written in the Quran, a holy book written 1,400 years ago. I also like it when they like to say that only idiots are religious. I like to Say "Oh, like Einstein?" haha...|`|vqZD2TzLaa	It depends on your definition of atheist.  Originally, from [Wiki]  "The term atheism originated as a pejorative epithet applied to any person or belief in conflict with established religion."  Such, therefor, did not necessarily imply an absence of  belief in a supernatural being or god.  Darwin, as I have read him, believed that science and religion were/are separate.  He continued to explore the concept of religion throughout his life.    Likely, he was an atheist.|`|374eccbf7968ba29755a2dbe3d4e9dc9aa	Murphdog is right.

gmaCvh00aa	It's not your job to help her.  She can only take advantage of you as far as you allow her to do so.    You are angry obviously at YOURSELF underneath it all for letting her make her problems into your problems.    Of course, you likely have heard this a zillion times and already know it.  What you really want is an easy solution--to be able to tell her to go screw and fix her own problems without you having any guilt about it or without her getting really angry with you.    The guilt is your choice and yours alone to carry or not.  Her anger at you will not be in your control--what is in your control is if you are going to let fear of someone being mad at you control your decision.  If you do decide to just act nice and swallow your anger and don't tell her to get her own self together, then you have no business complaining because you have made the choice to be a martyr.    THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN HELP HER HELP HERSELF IS TO FORCE HER TO DO IT BY STOPPING YOUR HELP.  Repeat that about 100 times or so.|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	your angry cause your doing everything for her but shes doing nothing to improve her condition. your getting frustrated cause shes depending and using you for everything. Be firm with her and tell her you have a life of your own to get on with.

That metastatic prostate carcinoma is anything less than horrifically painful.|`|YQOT68xFaa	The first is a myth. But it IS true that men and women are physically different, and that women are generally weaker physically (strength-wise).    The second - that's not really a myth. Women have absolutely no excuse to play the victim "poor me I'm so discriminated against" card anymore. We have so many rights and freedoms. We can be anything we want, pick who we marry, make all our own choices, just like a man. And in some ways we have more rights than men (especially as pertain to domestic relationships and childbearing). It isn't perfect, there is still some sexism in some places, but for the most part we have it made.    The third one is not a myth. That's true. Do you really think that a daycare worker is just as good for a child as its own mother? Because it's not the same at all. Like it or not, little children need to be cared for by their mommy and not a stranger. I think that women should stay home when their kids are little, if they are financially able to do so. It's best for the kids even if it isn't the most thrilling thing for the mom. Her fulfillment and chasing her dream should not come before caring for her child.    Here's a myth: children don't need fathers as much as they need mothers. Now THAT is a myth!      Char Girl - I completely agree. Good list!|`|3862H0WVaa	What century do you live in?    The first one, never heard anyone say that or even think it was true.  May tease women with it but it is ridicules any sane person would believe that.     The second one in my opinion when women do equal work they should get equal pay but how likely is that.     The third one, economic reality means many working class people can't afford one wage coming into the home so I don't think it is relevant and have yet to meet a man who thinks this.    A new one perhaps is the british labour governments assertion that children don't need fathers as they want to set up a village caring thingy.|`|Q8L7NWjwaa	Only men can physically ejaculate.|`|FL67UPPHaa	The first one is a myth, although I've never actually heard anyone say it. I hear more people saying that women are biologically superior because we can give birth. The other two are true -- women have achieved equal opportunity, but that doesn't mean outcome also has to be equal. There are fewer women in high status positions because fewer women choose high status positions. And children DO need a full time parent, whether that's the mother or the father.    Other myths:    Gender is a social product, and there are no inherent differences between men and women.    Any man who doesn't support modern feminism is a misogynist.    Any woman who doesn't support modern feminism is a doormat.    Women need affirmative action and other special privileges to be able to succeed in life.    There are no negative effects on a child's development if you put them in daycare from an early age.    Feminism is still needed in Western society.    The gender pay gap is caused by discrimination rather than personal choices.    Traditional marriages are all abusive.     SAHMs are lazy, uneducated and unambitious.    Women throughout history contributed nothing to society before feminism.    I could go on and on...

Here's the biggest deal myth of all time:  Children from single mother homes will turn out just fine.    The truth is 90% of our criminals, rapists, murderers, drug addicts, teen pregnancies, come from single mother homes (gov't statistic websites)    Upon further study Mothers & Fathers both in the same home are the reason we evolved from the stone age.

AA10894849	Sounds like narcissism.  Narcissistic people believe that they are better than everyone else and feel that other people should admire them. They believe that others are jealous of them.

It also might not be a personality disorder - some people just think they're better than others. They still function as humans in society so their ability to perform as citizens is not impaired, which won't warrant psychological investigation.     Some people never outgrow that "superiority" phase and some will. Many people use it as a cover for lack of self-esteem. Some get angry when their beliefs are questioned because they don't have a defense behind believing what they do, OR, they don't know why they believe what they do.   A mature person will understand that all people think differently. If they never do, then they're not worth being around.     You could try searching around on the link below.

My friends, their faces blurred and rather irrelevant, all turned around and gasped. Chris walked over to me, tapped me on the arm and lifted me up, grabbed my hand and pulled me down a large staircase in the middle of the room that certainly hadn't been there before. It came to a stop in this landing with an intricate design on the floor and yet nothing interesting, no purpose to the room. It was the waiting room I would spend two years of my life in. He turned here and continued down the stairs to the right, the only possible exit, which descended into a dark, cavernous room that was flooded by mercurial, mirror-like waters and dotted with large, flat stepping stones. As Chris pulled me across them (He barely drifted across the room, while I had to concentrate to move at the speed he was pulling me) I understood that, if I just followed Him, I'd have no chance of falling into the water. I could clearly see myself in the waters and realized that this was the Reflecting Pool that I would spend a year in after the Waiting Room. It was only after I crossed the waters and finally understood that I'd never be anything I'd ever want to be without first letting go of Chris, He pulled me through a strange little door and into a large, cozy room with a maze of cheap metal bookshelves and their dusty, dingy old tomes barely covering them, like flesh hanging on a metal skeleton. Everything in the room was painted with dabs of red, orange, burning green and violet. In here, in the Akashic Record that I finally reached after realizing I could never have, that I never needed Chris, He turned around and held my hands, then we both leaned in and pecked our lips together. Then again, but the second time we didn't seperate. Still holding my lips against His, I pushed them into a kiss again and woke up.    If anybody believes in precognitive dreams, that was one. I never had a dream so vivid, one that I could remember so easily, or one that was so aleghorical for my future.    My worst dream, though? Probably that same one.

phJfL2wTaa	They do, and will use it.    "Furthermore, some public schools are accusing parents of child abuse when they refuse to place their child on Ritalin and are taking parents to court. Psychology Professor William Frankenberger of the University of Wisconsin says of this trend, "It's disturbing to take a decision like that out of parents' hands" (USA Today, August 8, 2000).    http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhuber/readin...      "The Albany Times Union, in a May 7, 2000 copyrighted story, tells what happened to parents Michael and Jill Carroll of Albany, New York, when they tried to take their son, 7-year-old Kyle, off the Ritalin.    http://www.jpands.org/hacienda/supryno.h...    Kyle Carroll was first prescribed Ritalin last year, after he fell behind at school. Teachers drew up an Individualized Education Plan, a standard course of action for children with "special needs." But last fall, when Kyle started second grade, the Ritalin didn't seem to be doing much good. Furthermore, the Carrolls grew concerned that Kyle was only sleeping about five hours a night and eating just one meal a day --- lunch. So they told school officials they wanted to take Kyle off the Ritalin for two weeks to see if that helped. That's when they got a call, and then a visit, from a Child Protective Services worker, based on a complaint from Kyle's school guidance counselor. The charge? "Child abuse," in the form of "medical neglect." In plain English? Expressing doubts about keeping their child on dope."    "Furthermore, the Albany paper found the Carrolls' case is far from unique, reporting: "Public schools are increasingly accusing parents of child abuse and neglect if they balk at giving their children medication such as Ritalin, a stimulant being prescribed to more and more students.""|`|un0C52G8aa	What else do you propose doing about it? When I was in school, such children were usually expelled and sent to reform schools.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Yes, it has the power, but why would it discourage use of Ritalin directly? Schools that receive federal aid do not want to submit statistics that show bullies going around unchecked, back to the government with serious chances of their getting federal funds cut-back.    Well, parents consent is a real gate-keeper. However, let's not blindly ignore the fact that the parents usually tend to do what the school wants them to do.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	To my knowledge, they have the power to recommend it, but parents make the ultimate decision. My brother is on Prozac (he has Asperger's syndrome) and I seriously doubt that he would be if my parents didn't see it fit.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Power...no the parent has the final say in that (at least at this point) However..most parents tend to do what the school systems tells them to do when it comes to the ADD/ADHD trend without questions.|`|oK6sZ2fmaa	I know in our school district if the teacher believes and the doctor says a child is ADD or ADHD backing up the teachers claim then yes they want the child on something because the child can't learn and other children are disrupted if a child is bouncing off the wall, or you can try a different school, but to be honest, if I were a teacher of a ADD or ADHD child I'd want the child on something also and if the parent doesn't agree that's their choice, but they may have to home school. School isn't daycare and a teacher has enough to do without chasing a child around all day.|`|WKtakdsOaa	Giving your kids ritalin is like giving them speed. I know peeople who take it recreationally and after a while it is like being on a extreme paranoid comedown. This is the effects on adults so its terrible to think people give it to little kids|`|nvH62xo5aa	obviously|`|AWSmknxLaa	listen better...that is 100% FALSE    Students in school need to be under some control to learn.  There are MANY non-medical ways to do this.  In some cases medicine is required.  But the parents are NEVER required to put their child on medication.  There are many privater schools that deal with AAD children without medication.    Your misplaced hatred for Pharma tells a lot|`|emOhSyY5aa	No. Not without the parents consent. They can recommend that the child gets put on them but cant make a final decision unless the parents agree.|`|SdJP26nMaa	Until your child is 17, you are their guardian and can say yeah or nay.  I will warn you that the school may pressure you to "do something" about your child.  In certain states, they can put your child in an alternative school for children who are truant, etc., or they can simply make your child's life hellish in school.      If you know your child is trying their best and you are capable and financially able, you can home school your child.  There are home school resource gatherings where you can see about 500-600 different books, plans, etc.  I found Calvert School in Baltimore, MD to be an excellent school for grades 1 through 8.  You have the option of having an  away teacher grade their work and keep their grades.  They have a complete, comprehensive curriculum that is not based on religion, but is religion friendly (it was set up to be used by all faiths.)  I have used their curriculum for my son and have had excellent results.  There is also a home school high school based in Plano, Texas that is reasonable and the teacher grades your child's work and keeps records.  Of course, you do need to check with state laws regarding education in your state, but I hope this proves helpful.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	In 2001 the legislature instated the Ritalin Relief Act that states that schools cannot require parents to submit their children to special education testing or Ritalin treatment without the physicians, professionals and parents exploring other strategies.    The Individuals With Disabilities Act-IDEA, states that schools and state cannot keep children out of school in the event that the parent not take the recommendation to medicate.    Just an interesting note...  Ritalin use amongst school aged children has increased 700% since 1990.    Edit: Parents often don't know their rights and feel pressured by the so-called professionals.  Any mother or father SHOULD know their children and their needs better than a teacher.  Unfortunately, they often spend more time with the teachers so we feel like we can't trust our own judgement.

I am so sick of her focusing on the same stories over and over again and assuming that someone is guilty even before that person gets put on trial. Yes, the child's remains were found. Yes, the mother probably did it. Let the justice system handle it. If she is guilty, then she will likely go to jail for the rest of her life. We don't need to hear Nancy Grace rehashing the same details over and over again nearly every night. It was horrible that little girl was killed but she is hardly the only one. There are literally thousands of other children who are killed or turn up missing and their stories don't get told. I also wish the media would leave the grandparents alone. They are not the suspects. Poor George very likely did what he did because he's sick of being hounded by the media and has just learned that his granddaughter is dead and his daughter is suspected of doing it. Leave them alone.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Zodiac we finally agree on something.   This story is a tragedy.    Nancy Grace should be fired I can't stand to watch her.

What a horrible thing to do! But jail time? Nope. A boycott of his dolls would suffice.    And I also agree with you. They are exploiting this tragedy and sensationalizing it. It is such a sad story; it should be handled with respect and dignity and quietness rather than headlines and constant updates and a media circus. Out of respect to the family and to Caylee they should knock it off. And yeah, they should be ashamed of themselves.

I stopped attending public school in grade 8 and my kids do not attend public school either. I have nothing to do with schools at all.    In relationships - if I upset someone I own it and apologize. If there's a problem and I contributed to it, I try to make it right.    In my own life - my character flaws are my own fault. I am the one who chooses to give in and snark at people or be crude.

d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	Women are revictimized by the court sytem when they are forced through the judicial system.  How many people are willing to give up years of their life and relive a traumatic experience again and again when the conviction rate for sexual assaults is so extremely low.  There are people who simply cannot deal with this and choose to not disclose what happened.  There are those who do and are told by the police that there is not enough evidence.  The victim is not represented by anyone in the court system, he or she is merely a piece of evidence.  The defence attorneys  make sure that these victims are shown in the worst possible way.  They are grilled on the stand, called liars, and made to feel terrible throughout the procedure.  Who in there right mind would bring up a false rape allegation.  These people who claim this happens all the time do not have a clue what they are talking about.  It happens very rarely and when it does the chance of a person being convicted with no evidence is slim to none.  No we should not jail these victims we should take some money and set up better programs for victims and lobby the courts to take a tougher stance on any kind of sexual assault or abuse.|`|foUPphu2aa	Jailing women for falsely reporting rape is not meant to be a way of encouraging victims of rape to come forward. It is meant to be a way of discouraging false rape accusations and is protection for victims of false allegation.    EDIT - True, but, with respect, as harrowing as that article is to read the court in question incarcerated her because they decided her accusation was false not simply because she reported the rape in the first place.   The whole legal system in regards to rape is very poor indeed, a lot of women's lives are destroyed by rape and the rapists are allowed to walk free because of how difficult it can be to prove it (in this respect you're right; this influences some women's decision to not come forward). However, a lot of men's lives are ruined by either being accused or convicted of a rape they did not commit and for this they should be given some recourse.

The emptiness you feel is the lack of love your giving to yourself. Meditating is always a good way to fill the emptiness. The idea is to get outside of your thoughts, so concentrate on the space inbetween your thoughts and let that expand. You can also be attentive to your breathing, deep inhales deep exhales.     Be attentive to your thoughts, see what goes through your brain everyday, and filter out all the fear and negative thoughts. You need to interrupt the thought process everytime a fear or bad thought comes in and change it to a thought you want to think. You are not your thoughts, so don't let them control you. Also thoughts trigger your feelings, once you get in control of your thoughts, the feeling will wither away    first step is knowledge    Watch bruce lipton on google video watch all of his videos    also watch what the bleep do we know

It is putting you into a state of heightened relaxation where your mind is open to suggestion which is why some people do things they wouldn't normally do. This is the case for stage hypnotism. I don''t know for certain but beleive that hypnotherapy practitoneers use the same techniques but are obviously trained to a much higher degree. <br>            I am a firm beleiver that if it is for you there is no harm and can help you come to terms with say quiting smoking, it should be used as a crutch to help you. It can open your mind and in so doing release your subconscious, however what is hidden is usually better staying hidden. For example the practice of regression relies on hypnosis and unlocks things which should stay locked.|`|pUF71f1laa	Yes I did, I was Hypnotized once they said it would help me stop smoking.  All I can say is $175.00 later and I'm still smoking. <br>  <br>  Guess I'm the one that got smoked on that deal.|`|sUEMlnTsaa	yes, i hypnotized myself|`|kgNkuNOJaa	Me no ! some ppl never get hypnotized ever...but its been proved so that it can be used instead of anesthetizing|`|NnkcTBpjaa	No. Has it happened to you?<br>  <br>  Mabie u did, and they made it so u cant remember. <br>  <br>  Thats somthing to think about.....
glRSKBNfaa	The Honest truth is we don't know.  One would have to aggregate the labor supply cures of every citizen:<br>   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Labour_supply.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Labour...</a> <br>  <br>  The Laffer curve is based on this.  Some believe more working people are above the curve, meaning an increase in taxes will INCREASE hours worked, which would increase the tax base, which would INCREASE revenue, which is shown on this graph as t being less than t* (t* is the t drawn on the curve, t is the current tax rate) :<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Laffer-Curve.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Laffer...</a><br>  <br>  However, others argue that the majority of working people are below the curve on their labor supply curve, meaning an INCREASE in wage rate (read as: a DECREASE in taxes) will increase hours worked, increasing government revenue.  This is seen on the laffer curve as having t greater than t*.  <br>  <br>  That is the analysis at least.  I personally believe most people are below their curve on their labor supply graph.

3e3a79551e54dcec91edbfed2b6166eaaa	Yes a few times. when my daughter was only 4 months old I almost did something really stupid. but God sent me someone to help me through the rough spot and he saved my life.

QbzvWJe0aa	Most good posters have left :-(<br>  <br>  Although I read Millet a long time ago. It is an interesting paragraph, yes Lolita has been romanticized, how? It is about pedophilia. I would add to her list Henry Miller, who she also quotes: <br>  <br>  In 1970 (Sexual Politics 295) Kate Millett declared of Henry Miller:  "Miller is a compendium of American sexual neuroses, and his value lies not in freeing us from such afflictions, but in having had the honesty to express and dramatize them". Her study of him in Sexual Politics rather sardonically salutes Miller for his contribution to society in articulating "the disgust, the contempt, the hostility, the violence, and the sense of filth" associated with sexuality which "had never so explicitly been given literary expression before" (295-6). On the other hand,  Susan Griffin, in her 1981 publication of Pornography and Silence, made no bones about classifying Miller a pornographer for his treatment of 'physical love for women'.

8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Kittyloah, how old are you? <br>  <br>  Hi Kittyloah, thanks for providing your age:)<br>  You're becoming a woman :)<br>  And I think that is what this dream is about.  I see your mother (the Goddess) and your Grandmother (The Crone) handing down knowledge of womanhood to you.  You and your friend are Goddesses in training.  <br>  The Goddess, Gaia  (Who is also known as Mother Nature) is the ultimate expression of womanhood.  She is the ultimate Mother, and is represented in physical space by the planet we live on, Earth.  She is known by many other names, such as Ertha (where the name for our planet comes from), and Hertha, (where we get the word hearth) She has three faces, which symbolize three stages of a woman's life.  The faces are called the Maiden (that's you!) The Mother (your mom, the first Goddess) and the Crone (your grandmom). The Goddess is every woman, and every woman is a Goddess.<br>  At 13, you are in between childhood and adulthood.   Your elders are handing down knowledge to you, not only about more personal aspects of being a woman, but also teaching you how to become a "domestic Goddess".  That is why you are learning to fly on a broom, yet you also have wings.  The broom represents things they are teaching you like how to cook, and sew, and take care of a house, and things like that. It represents your future life as a wife and mother.  A broom represents marriage and domestic life.  In some cultures, getting married is called "Jumping the broom", and part of the ceremony is the bride and groom jumping over a broom laid on the ground, the broom represents a doorway from single life to married life.  You're having trouble navigating on the broom because of inexperience. <br>   Why would the Goddesses laugh?  I don't think they are laughing at you.  I think they are laughing partly because they remember goofy things they did in inexperience when they were learning to fly, and also because they are celebrating that you are becoming a woman, and they know that you are going to be just fine, and you will learn and gain experience.  You're going to join them soon :)<br>  Why would you cry?  Well, there are a couple of reasons why you might cry.  For one thing, it's time to let go of childhood, and start taking on more responsibility as an adult.  13 is a confusing time for a young woman, and sometimes we cry from confusion and frustration. For another, being a Goddess in training represents things that you aren't quite ready for yet, your future home and family, and that can be a little bit scary.  (that's why you feel happy and scared at the same time as you approach the broom, you're happy because you're gaining experience, and starting to take on more grown up responsibility, but you're scared because you know what comes along with that, and you're not quite ready for that yet.) You might also be crying because you feel insecure in your inexperience, and you want to learn to do things "right".<br>  Why did you bring your BFF along?  Because she's your bestest companion, who is also a Goddess in training, and you can share your experiences with her as you grow up together.  She laughs too, well, to cover her own insecurity, and because she is going through it with you.<br>  Why would you want to view all this from outside?  Well, sometimes we need to look things over from a detached point of view, sometimes it's hard to see the whole thing from your own perspective.<br>  I will laugh with the Goddesses, and offer you congratulations on your initiation into the Circle, and best wishes for the future.  Time and experience will show you how to fly.  :)<br>  Blessed Be  )O(|`|VNRJnNr2aa	this dream means Your Mother and what is all about her..the Gold means the character of your mothers values she feels like she throughly disciplines with values and lecturings|`|jhtPYQZDaa	If you are viewing yourself in third person this can be very significant. It can mean that you are either very self absorbed, or your sub-conscious mind is trying to tell you something about your body. Also the dream may have meant nothing but i have just finished learning about greek mythology in school and it sounds like some kind of important godess. do some research on what she looked like and read about the myths that she was in.  Also you spiritually may be a godess. but since your friend was also in your dream that narrow the possibilities of you really being a godess. but it's possible<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i just did some research and i think you might have seen the greek goddess Demeter. i may be wrong because there are thousands of greek goddesses but one of the paintings of her fits your description

HNAdM1hSaa	Personally I believe that the person who asked for the date should pay for the first date.  If they continue to date, then perhaps they should split the bill between them as it is not an automatic assumption that the guy is responsible to pay.  When I go on dates, I always bring more than enough money just so there is no feelings of obligations on my part should I decide not to see this person again.  =P|`|AA11307468	Dating should be give and take.  It shouldn't be the man giveth and the woman taketh.  It's a two way street.  Even when I first started dating and didn't really know much, I would always at least offer to contribute.  This happens to this day.  I actually feel guilty if I don't offer to contribute or treat.  It's very difficult to allow myself to let go and let the man pay.  I don't know why that is.  If a female friend offers to treat me when going out to eat or to the movies, I don't have a problem accepting that because it's always understood that I'll get the bill the next time we go out.  But with men, it's a struggle for me to allow him to pay.  That actually caused problems in my last relationship.  My partner felt insulted that I wouldn't keep my mouth shut and accept the gift of him paying.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I honestly don't know why this idea continues to be perpetuated. When I go on dates, I expect him to pay for his share and nothing else.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Thank you for adding "and men that go along with it."  I told my 17-year-old brother that, if the girl doesn't offer to pay on the third date, forget it.  <br>  <br>  I personally believe that whoever asked for the date should pay, then after that, whoever wants to pay (or can pay) should do so.

Do make sure that you are sized by a professional. (One lady sized me as a 34B, then changed it to 34D. Ugh, big difference!

r3gh7ho7aa	I did an interview with my AP Economics teacher for Journalism class about this very thing, except about "America's financial crisis."  I can't say much for the world... but I know that America started the global downturn, so if America picks up, will the world pick up?  Anyways, I respect/trust my teacher's opinion and will repeat a few of the Q & A I did with him here. (And I had previously typed this up lol...)    Q. Exactly how bad is the economy?   A. Historically, its fairly deep right now, but not as deep as it was in the 1980s and 60s. You can go back to several times that have been worse than this. It just depends on what is going to happen in the next year. I think were heading into 2 to 2.5 years of recession. Right now, the unemployment rate is 7.2 percent; historically, that isnt so bad.  If we get up to the 10 percent range, then we its time to worry a bit.    Q. How long do you think it will be till we pull through this economic crises?  A. Well, there are a lot of variables that go into that. With all the economic stimulus packages going around and Obama taking over, you really dont know because it all depends on consumer confidence. Fortunately, we have a new president coming in, and with a new president, theres always new hope. I think that will help ease it a little bit, but Im looking for it to be early to mid 2010 before all is said and done about the economy.    Q. With the following year, what immediate effects do you foresee because of our current economy?  A. When people lose their jobs, they stop spending, and that hurts the businesses that would normally be selling to them. People are afraid of losing their jobs, so theyre going to stop spending.  What you start to see is companies, that would otherwise be okay, start to have problems because no one is buying their products. Therefore, youll start to see more layoffs. Revenue generated by sales tax will be down; state governments wont be able to raise the funds they need, and at the national level, hopefully youll start to see cutbacks on pet projects with funds directed at more to places where it is needed in the economy.    BASICALLY... economic hiccup... happens all the time :)|`|wvk6Kbnwaa	I believe it is a case of history repeating itself. If history keeps repeating itself in this way, within the next 15-20 years we will enter WW3 which is looking likely.    Tensions between Russia and the West are now becoming tighter and it is just as tense in the East with Iran.  If the West keep interfering in other countries, surely it is only a matter of time before Russia forms an alliance with another superpower , say China, or Iran?|`|5Snex2peaa	Keynesianism did not exist in 1929.  The current situation is partly the result of the government misusing Keynesinism for decades.    In 1929 the American people had not spent the previous 50 years being brainwashed by the television set into being good consumers and there were no credit cards.  Americans spent 3 generations forgetting the lessons of the Depression and have let stupidity get out of control.    The nitwit economists helped though.  How many Americans were high school graduates in the 30s?  So why haven't economists suggested mandatory accounting in all of that time?

YwqfYVPbaa	I am white but I am not rich. My parents were not rich either. My family has never owned slaves. We weren't even over here until the 20's when my ancestors immigrated from Poland. I grew up on food stamps and lived in the "ghetto" until I was put in foster care at age 16. Some black comedians seem to think that these things are indigenous to African Americans only but they are not. All impoverished Americans deal with this kind of stuff. It would be racist for me to assume that a  person is ignorant, is criminally inclined or is into drugs just because of the color of their skin. It is equally racist for someone to assume that I grew up having everything handed to me and have never known adversity just because of the color of mine.     Some comedians that talk about race, I don't mind, because they use their comedy as a means to bring people closer together. Examples would be Richard Pryor or Carlos Mencia. Some I do not appreciate because they are downright racist. An example of this is Dave Chapelle. He said that white people don't use washcloths (wtf?!) and he also did a sketch where he pushed a white baby down a flight of stairs.I don't care what color the baby was.It is NOT funny. It particularly effected me because I was pregnant when I saw this.|`|NOoEI13uaa	I don't like the word "reverse racism" No matter who you're talking about, when you're downing someone because of there race, it's racism. That's all there is to it.|`|Gvvn84q6aa	Sorry if you are offended...    But if you look at statistics enough, and go to a college level sociology class, you will realize that having people dislike you is pretty legitimate.     White people are more likely to get a job, go to college, have social mobility, and less likely to go to jail.    Is this because they are superior? No, not at all. It is because we are riding the wave caused by our ancestors. Our parents had money, their parents had money, and their parent had money. If you think that just anyone can succeed and be rich if they wanted to, then you may need to take a look back.    Are you willing to say anyone that is poor is poor because they are lazy? Or are some people just in better situations.      LONG STORY SHORT- the situation of being a white guy is one of the luckiest ones you could be in, in terms of economic success. It is shameful, but true. Our ancestors made it that way, and minorities have a right to be upset. Not only that, but I will never worry about someone making anti-white remarks because of all of the advantages that comes along with it. It is a crappy situation and it is shameful that one race has it so good. But you need to acknowledge that, at least.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	the comedy doesn't bother me really, plenty of white people joke around about blacks too (the show House for example) when youre white you don't notice it as much. but what does offend me a bit is real reverse racism.. not allowing white people to have jobs (skilled laborers for example) in order to "stimulate the economy". i personally don't care what color the skin is of the person who builds the bridges i drive on ...so long as they are SKILLED. I don't think risking safety is economically very smart.|`|9wGHEmHIaa	because everyone is a little racist so get over it i go to an almost all black school and get called all those cracker honkey and the norm so get over it no one should pull the race card just don't pay attention

Also there are black beauty pageants, no whites allowed but if there was a white only beauty pageant, well, you get my drift.  I was walking through the mall and one group of black guys was trying to get the attention of another, they yelled (loud) the "N" word and that's perfectly acceptable.  I think if it's considered racist and demeaning for a white person to say that, then it should be an unacceptable word...period.

It would be worth it. They are only words, and only as powerful as we choose to let them be.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	I totally understand what you mean and I'm not racist. But Civil Rights is there for us too. Ya just have to use it. I was discriminated a few years ago by another ethnicity. I was doing business on the phone with a man of a different race that mostly dealt in minorities as such. He asked me quite bluntly (since my name didn't sound caucasian), "Are you white?". I said I was and my dealings with that person became difficult. His tone changed, his dealings with me changed, and it was obvious why. I had to deal with that person and became pretty upset.I never showed my dismay to him or acted differently. I'd never had an incident like that EVER happen. It went on for weeks. So, I contacted Civil Rights (it's not just for minorities) and they dealt with the problem head on. The man got was talked to and after that, all was fine. I know he knew he did wrong and probably hated my white guts, but he treated me kindly after that.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	I don't take it personally. For years other races were subjugated as inferior to whites in nearly every case. As a child I remember white only signs everywhere and I'm still alive and not that old so it wasn't that far in the past as many would have you believe.  That said, I also understand your point. It's a minor annoyance in society as a whole, but in prisons, where the overwhelming majority of inmates are black and Mexicans a young white kid is far more likely to be raped and possibly traded and sold as a sex slave while locked up.  We don't send people to prison to be treated in that way, but it's joked about as if it's perfectly alright and almost a favor done for everyone to "keep us safer". But then you complain, and perhaps rightfully so about not being able to use the word nlgger, but it's OK to say honky on the outside.  White people have given up our own solidarity and fear the label as racists because of much of our own extremely shameful past, but we have nobody to blame for this except for ourselves..  Flip the coin and you often see the same head on both sides.   If you want solidarity among whites then you have to do so for the right reasons. Doing it for the wrong reasons puts you back into the same class as the very people you resent.  There is nothing wrong with solidarity and being proud of your ancestors accomplishments, but you also have to acknowledge their heinous deeds as well.
plBXp91Daa	Hi Jules.  What your thinking isn't messed up it is normal i guess you also wonder how it is to having sex with someone so don't worry about that your messed up or your mind is messed up.  xoxo Nila (Btw i like your name.)|`|AA12219135	I will probably get jeers for this but, I applaud you.  If more people thought like that, maybe not as many marriages would end in divorce.  You have put a price (something you value highly) on whether or not to pursue a man.|`|s89uFNyeaa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with that kind of thinking. Most people think about sex a lot more than they will admit, sexual desire is as controllable as hunger. Sure, you can just not eat, as well as not having sex, but that doesn't mean that you won't feel hungry, or you won't think about sex. It's a normal thing, especially if you're still young.    I'm only in my 20s and I kinda think it's cute how you said it's not the sex you think about, but the feeling of being close enough to someone to have sex with them. That is respectful because it shows that you are looking for that emotional connection, not the physical, even if sex is a physical act. Don't be ashamed!|`|KyAjmaOyaa	People will say this is a normal feeling, and it is, but what you should think about is what is really right. Think about the consequences you can get for making such a decision. Think about how your future will be. Will you feel guilty after doing it?.. Good or Evil? Can you resist certain temptations or not?.. The decision is up to you, but get ready to face the consequences. I suggest you make the right decision. Choose good.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Your hormones are just kicking in thats all, nothing weird about that at all when hormones kick in we tend to have different feelings & ideas
H55nCLqPaa	The male is at the mercy of female sexual selection. It is like this in all species. The male is massively oversupplied with something for which the female has fairly little demand (sperm), which means the female has all the power.    Male peacocks display their feathers and the females choose.    Male stags rut with each other and the females choose.    Human males compete in sport, at work, on the battlefield and the females choose. All male competition is driven by a desire to be selected by females as a mate and so women ultimately determine men's behavior.|`|ndopqX6Taa	Men who say this have never hit that spot on a woman. Men can use sex as power as well!|`|W1VqOP83aa	Sexual attraction to women will make men act more positively towards these women in many situations. A boss may higher a pretty girl over a man due to attraction. Women may get lesser sentences for crimes by looking cute/sexy. Women get bought drinks, men pay for them. A lot of it is just human nature, sometimes men are especially nice to pretty girls and don't even notice it...|`|DQIACrmfaa	they don't.|`|71mE0r7kaa	I think you mean " What do men mean when they say women have sexual power over men." They mean that men have to work for sex.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	It means a man could end up in the dog house for returning home drunk smelling of a different woman's perfume.     Seriously though, it means many men are open about accepting their love for sex than women do. Not to say that one's drive is lower or higher than the others, but I've overheard kids say things like 'we rule the world with what's between our legs'.    Good question !|`|BHb5LPb1aa	I always thought it was the other way around women have sexual power over men  But if a guy says it he most likely is the dominating type and the women he is talking about is sexual submissive so he controls what he does to her sexually|`|eBMKmgCjaa	Sorry, but if you have to ask you are either autistic or not very attractive.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	you mean women have sexual power over men, right?    lets face it.....women have NOTHING on men except for one thing.....their beauty. if it wasn't for women's beauty, they would mean NOTHING to us. and would have no power over us whatsoever.

oZPLI8Y5aa	Because the way you are impacts the way you see things. We automatically filter things according to our understanding.

9EW08emXaa	I'm not really sure. My daughter is similar to you, though. Just the thought of not being able to go makes her need to go. She hasn't ever actually peed on herself though.     For her, she tends to have a high amount of energy in everything she does.  When you are excited about something, or anxious about something, your adrenaline releases and one of the symptoms can be an urge to pee.      We try to give her many opportunities to release her energy and her adrenaline. Doing new and exciting things, even though she feels the adrenaline and anticipation (and might feel like needing to pee) after a few times, your body can learn to use the adrenaline in the right ways...like help you focus on the sport, or climb the mountain more safely (if you are climbing a mountain for example...)    Anyway...if you try to continue to do things that will give you an adrenaline rush, concentrate and focus and tell your mind where the energy needs to go.    On a medical note, you could bring it up at the doctor. You might have an overactive bladder and they have medication to treat it.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Okay first of all I am not trying to insult you but here are my thoughts and opinions.    What brought this on? There has to be something that brought this on? And I'm not talking about an accident when you were 5. Did you pee on your self in public since you were say 8 yrs old?    If nothing brought it on then you need to just stop. I think you are looking for attention from your parents. Do you get to have much one on one time withyour parets since they have split up? Have they remarried or do they have a new boyfriend/girlfriend?    You could try calling Dr Laura. I know it sounds corny and lame but she is a radio dr. and I have heard people call her show with similar issues and she gives them advice that makes sense to me.  I think the number is just 1-800-drlaura. Let's see she is on from 1-4 my time, so it would be I think 3-7. Or it could be 1-4. I find her on an AM station. You could also go to her website and figure out when she is on in your area and even wich chanels to find her on.

BhumxInEaa	Indexing means connecting some payment to some economic indicator. It is normally used to adjust for unforeseen conditions. Some obvious examples:    1. The interest rate on adjustable rate mortgages are tied to something like "the prime rate".    2. Pensions (including Social Security in the U.S.) and annuities are often tied to the cost of living.   http://www.dixon.com.au/dixon/News.aspx?...  More recently, even the U.S. Treasury offers bonds tied to inflation. The idea is that the recipient gets X "real" dollars back, not X nominal dollars.  http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/30/b...  http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/ex...    3. Some long term commodity contracts have adjustment clauses tied to the world market price.

If you have some savings now is the time to invest them. Not only will their value probably be destroyed by the governments inflationary policies anyway but you could make huge returns.    You should invest in things where the fundamentals are sound, these are the sectors that will lead the recovery. Think logging, steel works, iron mines and the like. Do NOT invest in the financial sector.|`|AA10227142	Sell your self for marriage lol|`|kXCgQoYLaa	Read Paul Mc Kenna's book ; according to him and all the other guys who write them self- help manuals, they can make you rich!

(Some ways are illegal of course, or only legal if carried out by banks!)    The basic principle is that you have to get a higher income than expenditure, then your savings will increase over time. You also need to invest your savings wisely so they grow. I've found that property has been an excellent long-term investment, but other people prefer to run businesses etc. This is get-rich-slowly, and it's a lot more reliable than any get-rich-quick scheme.    So to get started you need a well paid job and you need to trim back your outgoings to the absolute minimum.    An important factor is that kids keep you poor. Each child costs about 200,000 to bring up, so do the arithmetic. This comes into the "expenditure" part of the equation. If you *must* have kids (why? there are more than enough humans!), then wait until after you're rich, or you'll probably never get there.     Don't trust other people to look after your money. If a financial advisor knew anything about making money, he wouldn't be a financial advisor!    As for your half-million, no thanks, I don't need it, it wouldn't make much difference to my life!  ;-)|`|UI2R4zPPaa	Listen to the Secret by Rhonda Byrne's  or rent the movie.  It is very helpful.  Since I have done this I have been very successful at everything I try to do. Only a year and a half out of bankruptcy and I own my own business and I am a stay at home mom.  I am also getting ready to buy another house. Not only does it help with becoming rich, but also with everything in your life that you want to change.  It is definitely worth looking into!

Also, many supermajor oil companies are buying out alternative fuel companies to either oversee the future of the Fuel Industry, or to gut out their potential competition.|`|603aeb442141df6dba145b00cf2a2a86aa	I don't think so because everyone knows that it will go back up but.. the thing that is going to slow down the demand fo alternate fuels is the fact that right now no one is buying anything. No one is buying cars whether it is green cars or what. Actually many people are losing jobs and the ability to pay for cars. Many are being reposessed. I think what prompted oil companies to lower their cost is the fact that overall the entire economy is messed up and they realized that with so many people losing jobs or being pinched, they would be forced to car pool, bike to work, walk o us alternative choices than to continue to pay 4-5 dollars a gallon.

3p6wp7DYaa	Do you know what a free market economy is? Here is the definition from Encarta: "Economic system in which individuals, rather than government, make the majority of decisions regarding economic activities and transactions (see Capitalism). Individuals are free to make economic decisions concerning their employment, how to use or accumulate capital, what expenditures to make, and whether to use their resources now or to save them for later consumption. The principles underlying free-market economies are based on laissez-faire (non-intervention by government) economics and can be traced to the 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith."    So think about it. The government would not interfere at all. There would be no subsidies for farmers, so if the price of wheat and corn decreased they would not have any price supports from the  government. There would be no transfer payments such as Social Security and welfare. There would be no regulation restricting businesses operations, no minimum wage laws, no rent controlled apartments, no Medicare, and much more.    Do you think it would be practical for a major country to just let the economy be what it might without intervening to make sure there is a fair distribution of income and that the poorest in the society have at least a minimum level of protection against hunger and disease?
d0brzTt2aa	no, there's nothing wrong about you. If it is, then everyone would have something "wrong" with them.    I was the same way in high school. However, I do know that sarcasm isn't what people look for sometimes. Try to gauge the situation to see if sarcastic comments are appropriate or not. It can be a good mood killer. For instance, if everyone is laughing and having a good time, sarcasm, if taken the wrong way (which it easily can), can make you look like the bad guy/girl, like you're not enjoying yourself and is trying to be negative.    But like you said, that type of sarcastic, introverted personality is alright because it can be witty and perfect at times. And also, once you get to know certain people well enough, and they know you well enough, then it's perfectly alright bc they understand and they enjoy it.    I just know, from personal experience, that I wouldn't like to hang out with someone sarcastic and depressed-like 100% of the time.|`|dBkEqT2naa	I think that that is an arbitrary word that some people use. If they have a problem with that, then let them say w/e they feel like since they don't understand you.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	I've been told some of the same things, but the reality is that I don't like drama in my life, so I keep all the emotion to a minimum.  Using a little pop-psych on you, my guess is that you find that the best defense is a good offense.  People who might judge or criticize you are put an arm's length away by your sarcasm, which in turn might make you popular among others.  Or, I'm full of crap - in that case, that's just who you are!|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	No. i guess its just a nickname. To get the "robot" name away, try showing some strong feelings of love, hate, anger, happiness. Try to be less sarcastic and people will understand you more. Sarcasm really gets hard to understand after a while|`|d3YToW4Aaa	wow.i never heard of someone like you before.lol at you feeling uncomfortable hugging people.dammmm.maybe you are depressed because everyone i have ever known hugs or can say i love you.or even LUV YA BABESS!!really easily.are you depressed because you sound like it.noooo,you sound goth
ZwECcnh1aa	My ex is. She needs people to be after her in order to feel good about herself. Its sad, but the men are there, so shes alright.|`|AA10292836	SOME ARE,NOTHING IS 100% !|`|rl7Au6Lqaa	Of couse not, lol!  Many women are made to feel insecure by the misogynists in their lives.|`|XWwnf90paa	Everyone is different but i see no reason for a woman to be like that!|`|8253606e962dc30046c3b40e0678936aaa	I've never had a boyfriend. The only time when I'm insecure is when I can't make enough money|`|62ZBofvPaa	Some women are...my cousin is one of them to where if she can't be without a bf for any amount of time--she stays in miserable relationships (even long-distance no sex ones) because any relationship is better than no relationship to her.|`|PwvU3LQBaa	Not me.|`|F1mIcFoTaa	Women are secure without a man. They are secure without violent attacks, rape, verbal abuse, etc.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	No, I know how to defend myself.|`|AA11307468	I never have been.  But there are some women who seem to need a man in their lives.  So the answer is yes, SOME women are insecure without a man.  But I would say MOST women are self-sufficient.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Not the ones who are already secure.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Some women are, some are not.  What an easy two points.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Some need constant male attention.    Some are fine without it.    Then there are the lesbians.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	No; if and only she's secure with herself. No man should have to deal with someone else's luggage; he's got his own life to live. In the same token no man should have to deal with an insecure man. Men wear shoes, too, you know.|`|Ty3NiCIWaa	No. I have a weapon under my bed.
AA10911602	Use your thinker for thinking.  In 1960 I could buy a burger, coke and fries for about 50 cents. Today that costs about $4.00. This is 8 times as much. Suggesting that all prices have increased by a similar amount since then, the CPI from 1960 to now would be 8.00    Lets say the minimum wage then was $1.00, what would it have to be now? Look at how you did this and apply that to your question above. You will find it is not CCCCCCcccccccc|`|AFgZrHYCaa	cccccccccccooooooooooooollllllllllllllll...

ZII6YCk1aa	We generally want them to come over and talk to us because we are so scared of looking like an *** or a jerk to move.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Laugh, as he looks backwards again and ends up walking into a telephone pole.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	i like it when if i smile at a woman.....she actually comes up to me and starts a conversation with me. even if its about the stupidest thing like "Do you like bikes?" because I know she is interested in me back......because she is making the effort.    this is rare. most guys have to be the go getters and go after the woman. but its a pleasant suprise when the woman actually makes the first move once in a while.|`|IjSVNOZraa	Just take matters into your own hands. Too many girls try to psychoanalyze a dude's every thought.     Just go up to him and say hi. What have you got to lose?|`|rl7Au6Lqaa	Staring at people creeps them out.|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	If she likes me then I hope she smiles back. Then maybe I walk over and talk to her. I would not bring my buddy over with me if I was trying to talk to a woman. I fully expect to get shot down if I did that.    If she doesn't smile back or make some indication that she is interested then I assume she is not and go about my business.
Pa4cyKn7aa	I don't know why I would feel guilty about my personal relations because of how a man I am not familiar with is behaving.    I was eating lunch alone in a cafe when an employee sat himself down across from me.  I wasn't creeped out, just very annoyed that he didn't ask me if he could sit with me.  I had seen him around and he would speak to me, so I somewhat knew who he was.|`|wSjLVDteaa	im a man but i think a gun would be more effective, more scary, more convenient, more small, and more loud than a man    everyone should have guns, not just women|`|IjSVNOZraa	What makes him a creep? Just for talking to you?    Maybe HE'S lonely or bored too and is NOT interested in you but just looking for a friend. I don't understand what makes him gross, nor do I understand how it's a semi/completely dangerous situation.    If he was touchy or grabby, then get your big girl pants on and just walk away. You don't need a man to stick up for you, YOU need to stick up for you. If he's just trying to make conversation, then stop being such a ***** to him.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	No, never.     I don't even feel guilty for being a woman!     Imagine that =o)|`|wkjncmHTaa	Guilty? Why on earth would I feel that?    Pissed off, yes, but it's not exactly hard to tell someone where to go.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Of course not. I just feel pissed off.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Why should I feel guilty for being harassed?  He should feel guilty for being such a tool.|`|HNAdM1hSaa	No I think perhaps "guilty" is not the right emotion that I feel when I am being harassed by some creepy guy.  I think I am more upset that a woman cannot go out and have something to eat without a guy thinking it's an automatic, " hey I am lonely so you have the right to come and harass me!"  =P|`|UspK4SQBaa	I don't think "guilty" is the word you meant to use, but to answer your question, no.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	be nice. even the creeps need love.|`|8253606e962dc30046c3b40e0678936aaa	No, I feel proud that I can tell a guy to go "**** himself"|`|qkmsixWXaa	No, I would just feel uncomfortable and may wish to have a male companion at the moment, but not guilty for it.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	No, I just tell them to piss off.|`|f5R5BPTDaa	HUH!??  as if!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No, why would you? It would be a bit silly to feel guilty. Anyway, is the guilt about eating alone or not having a partner? People with partners sometimes eat alone and people without partners sometimes eat with friends.    Gross guys don't hit on me often, and I haven't been single for a while anyway so it's not really a problem I have.    Harriet|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	No but I think I used to.  That was misguided.  Just because I'm an unattached woman does not mean that I am putting myself forth as a potential mate for any man who would like to consider me.    You shouldn't feel weirded out because a strange MAN wants to join you for lunch, you should feel weirded out because a STRANGER wants to join you for lunch.  That's really not appropriate.  And as for talking to strangers in general, sometimes I'll exchange pleasantries or a bit more if the person seems friendly, and not if I don't feel comfortable.  It is always my choice, as it should be.  They have a choice, too, after all, not to speak to me; I wouldn't be offended if a stranger didn't want to converse.
pzLDXL6gaa	I know, I don't know what their problem is. Some of them have real issues and their questions make no sense. People are entitled to spend money on others if they so choose.    Harriet|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Wow! I agree with Rio.|`|IuP0ryOMaa	I think that some men think that they can impress a women by flaunting how much $$ he has, or makes.  Usually these are the men that either    A) Only want one thing  or  B) Are incapable of talking about anything other than their $ and how great they are.    Either way these men are not worth talking to, and if they want to throw their money away like that then who cares, they're just stupid.    But, there are some men that do like to pay for dates and buy their girlfriends gifts and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But from personal experience is it rather annoying when a guy showers you with gifts ALL the time.|`|1P5qWMQ0aa	Settle down honey...|`|5k9NWD0aaa	Agreed...I also agree that women who are attracted to a man's money have no room to whine when men dangle money to attract them and then dump them when they are done playing...|`|A7r8xX7saa	Oh, really? That's the reason why men spend money on women? It sounds to me like you are just using that as an excuse to use men for their money.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	They are NOT incapable of giving love, and if you are the type of person who accepts money for "favors" perhaps you should label it what it is PROSTITUTION!|`|A71Uu05Uaa	"because men are incapable of giving love."   Wow...  I'm sensing daddy issues.    Men tend to love a lot more deeply and loyally than women from my experience.  They provide for their woman because they love them.  Not just for the heck of it.    On the other hand, if you are incapable of appreciating a man's love, good chance you'll just be after his money.  As with many women these days.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	"Men are incapable of giving love." Hmmm, wonder how you got that idea.    Both men and women have a responsibility to put an end to the arbitrary rule of men as providers and women as recipients.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Don't say men like all of us do it. We spend money on women to be a gentleman, but it is illogical to rant on about it. Maybe that guy just had a bad day?|`|7aK81hsbaa	the ones that rant spend the least, they grieve over every penny they part with. and they get what they pay for- zip. men who are truly prosperous don't worry about having or spending, they don't consider themselves victims either. that's called class, moaners have none.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I"d say men are 100% illogical who rant about women taking money from men; why do they give money to women if they hate it so much? Further, why are the ones who give money away to women whining in this forum about it; I wouldn't take money from one of those guys if my life depended on it. I'd rather starve.|`|PNwr3JgBaa	They way I think of it is if I pay for you, I own you.|`|rl7Au6Lqaa	I would say the sheer exhilaration of the rant plays a big role.  That plus the fact they're losers who buy into the misogynist crap on cranky websites.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I don't believe that men are incapable of love, but I do agree with you that it is annoying when the men that only talk about how much they have and what they make are the same men that complain that they only attract gold-diggers.  If you market yourself a certain way, don't be surprised when someone buys the package.
AA10733131	This could be an indication that you are prone to do things to please others and put yourself and your needs on the shelf.

a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Crime can be a relative word. It depends on what you consider a crime to be. There are crimes of passion, statutory crimes and crimes of deceit. There are violent crimes as well and some overlap.  There is also civil disobedience which often is no more a crime than not doing what you know to be wrong.  Organized "criminal justice" is often no justice at all and instead a way for certain groups or even individuals to get rich off the sweat of the alleged criminals. They make 'criminals" into unpaid or very low paid slaves and make huge profits then give the incarcerated no credit for what was learned while locked up in servitude. Our "criminal justice" system isn't just, but we have been lead to believe anyone locked into it deserves whatever crime can be perpetrated upon them and we know this to be false, but go along anyway thinking we're somehow safe than before. In reality we become less safe dealing with people who once released become more bitter and often more violent than ever before.  Many are slammed into a system where systematic rape and torture is commonplace while the guards look the other way. Then we laugh at the jokes about dropping the soap, but in all reality many are simply victimized far worse than anything that they could have ever done to society and made to pay far worse sentences than anyone would ever agree to.    You want weaknesses? Check with the Human Rights groups around the US, specifically Human Rights Watch, hrc.org. You'll find plenty of weaknesses.|`|oZPLI8Y5aa	Beccaria a father of criminology offered that to inhibit crime, we must deter it by making punishment swift and sure and appropriately severe. We cannot practice that so we fail. The mafia for example always is swift and sure and they have almost a perfect contrl over its members.

Presumably you are exploring his life to discern how the intense hatreds came to be.|`|KTIFEo0Aaa	in my opinion i believe it is to understand why he did it.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	It depends what you want to understand.  If you want to understand what led Hitler to seek this course of action, then understanding his life and what he was trying to do (blame someone other than Germans for the history of the German nations failure) then you need to know why he chose the Jews, although he also thought that Gypsies should also be eliminated and he would have thought Greeks also should be eliminated if he did not think that they were already degenerated racially (a cockamamie concept).  He was surprised that the Greeks put up so much resistance in the war; he did not think they were capably, but his theories were extremely simplistic and ill-informed, proving you do not have to be a genius to be insane or lead a country.
94NYYq5Haa	Could be a bit of narcissistic personality disorder mixed with some psychosis.    Or you could just lose the mood swings and make the character have antisocial personality disorder.  Maybe you could make the mood swings an anger thing where the person gets outrageously angry if someone "wrongs" him/her.      disconnection from reality kind of implies a psychotic tendency.  But you could certainly mix that with antisocial features.  Or you could make the apathy part of the psychosis, maybe the character doesn't feel remorse b/c he/she is disconnected from reality.|`|IUlIixJLaa	All of this could be related to a manic-bipolar disorder except for maybe the no remorse part, I would say that that leans towards psychotic|`|KHipZhWoaa	A mental disorder or mental illness is a psychological or behavioral pattern that occurs in an individual and is thought to cause distress or disability that is not expected as part of normal development or culture. The recognition and understanding of mental disorders has changed over time and across cultures. Definitions, assessments, and classifications of mental disorders can vary, but guideline criteria listed in the ICD, DSM and other manuals are widely accepted by mental health professionals. Categories of diagnoses in these schemes may include dissociative disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, developmental disorders, personality disorders, and many other categories. In many cases there is no single accepted or consistent cause of mental disorders, although they are often explained in terms of a diathesis-stress model and biopsychosocial model. Mental disorders have been found to be common, with over a third of people in most countries reporting sufficient criteria at some point in their life. Services for mental disorders may be based in hospitals or in the community. Mental health professionals diagnose individuals using different methodologies, often relying on case history and interview. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options, as well as supportive interventions and self-help. Treatment may be involuntary where legislation allows. Several movements campaign for changes to services and attitudes, including the Consumer/Survivor Movement|`|lXoLX1sdaa	Psychotic like Ted Bundy.|`|OujhXy2yaa	well if you lose the mood swings they sound sociopathic|`|xaVU1pV5aa	antisocial disorder, fer sure.    possibly a psychoses brought on by shizophrenia.    or you could just write that character in as an extreme alcoholic that is masking the illness therefore only adding to the underlying mental illness. it could go many ways.    have fun with it and don't forget to to write your character as a worn down skallywag named bocephus.    you'll be just fine.    always go with the gut.    i've been writing for over 50 years and i've found this method most helpful.    immulating a family member will almost always put you in the right direction.  we all have the "crazy uncle".    good luck,  young padawan
