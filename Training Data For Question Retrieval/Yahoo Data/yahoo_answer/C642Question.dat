20080318154731AAT8ZM6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	I like my friend and sometimes I think he likes me, but I'm not sure. He'll always talk to me when he sees me, and we spend most of our free time together (though generally with other friends). He smiles a lot at me and keeps eye contact. He generally looks at me while talking to other people, including me in conversations he's having with others, and joining in with conversations I'm having. He'll stand or sit close to me, and won't move if his arm is touching mine. He offers to help me with things, even if I haven't asked, and always offers to drive me home, even telling other people he'll take me when they offer. He's always teasing me, and making me laugh. He notices things about me, like when my hair's a bit different. He remembers little things I've told him. He opens up to me about things he doesn't tell other people. Do you think he likes me? How can I tell? I'm too scared to ask him, and he's shy so he doesn't make these things obvious.

20080321101610AAVpGZl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Too attatched?	ok so my boyfriend and i have been seeing eachother for five months but been together for two months....i told him from the begining i didnt want a serious relationship but we've slowly been seeing eachother a lot more and my feelings for him are getting stronger!! IM TOO SCARED to open up to a guy and show him how i feel cuz i think that just gives me a bigger chance to get my heart broke. I've always been the type of girl to have guys on the side and never been committed till now....its different..but i like it a lot! i feel like this relationship is making me better as a person and i also like it cuz its a good healthy relationship!! But i'm just scared to get hurt...and i haven't really let him know how i feel and the other night he said he loves me but i just couldnt say it back because im scared to get hurt. I played it off like i didnt hear him and changed the subject...   Help me!!! I really like him but do you think its bad that im not letting him know how i feel??

20080323091207AAyS3AS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Akward situation...friends hooking up?	So I introduced my guy friend to one of the girls I hung out with. As time goes by they got closer but would not hang out if I wasn't there.       During Christmas break my aunt and grandmother die so I have to spend and extra week home while classes were in session...I get back to campus and my guy friends tells me he hooked up with my girl pal. I wasn't mad at all, I knew she was a bit of a nymph and he said they wouldn't have sex anymore but during the semester they did and got even closer and just started ditching me and in addition to that my guy friend was just acting like an asshole to me.      During drunken confessions last night my girl pal tells me that   my guy friend said that the only reason I don't like him anymore is because she and him get closer, well yeh! They're sleeping together and ditched me!       I have talked less and less to him after what happened but I still feel like he made everything get so bad and awkward..I am hurt by what he said..should I still talk to them?

20080324234542AABdYiy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex Girlfriend?!?!?	Okay so me and my girlfriend broke up over a week ago:      She broke it off with me because I lied to her, twice. It was about pornography and it was a terrible thing to do. The second time she didn't care as much because it was animated porn, but the mistrust just killed her. We had gone out for over a year, we talked about living together, marriage, kids. when we started, (on a couple of dates, not a couple yet), I slept with my old ex. All of these things just couldn't allow her to date me anymore, at the time.      I love her so much, and she still loves me. She's told me before but she says she can't be romantically involved with me(at least in college). I really miss her, because we've decided to take a break for a week before seeing each other again. I really want her back! I know the love is still there. I'm not sure wether to take time and let her heal or to tell her I love her with all my heart right away      I know I did wrong but I lover her so much! what can I do?

But she also asked if it would be okay if she brought her brother along (My friend) I said sure. Is this a date or not?

20080325022006AAEdEhB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help...this means my only prom....?	Ok, so there is this girl I kind of like, I can tell she might like me too, because I ALWAYS notice her gazing at me. She is quite attractive, she knows a few of my friends. She is a clear virgin and I doubt has ever had much relation expeirance whatsoever, I also here she is OCD. I know I could get her for sure, but there is a HUGE problem here.      Last year I smoked pot about 24/7. Before lunch, after, before school, all the time, and I got a huge, terrible reputation for it. I t sullied my chances of ever getting a girl last year. She defiantly doesn't seem like the girl who would condone these kinds of actions. I have "quit" and I have a rep for it now, as to quiting and cleaning up, half the school thinks that, the other half still thinks im a huge stoner loser.      The problem is my "friends" know I still do it. And I know they won't help me out on this. I don't really like my friends, but there is no doubt it's them or no one, don't even question this.

20080329015511AARrA0F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Asking out a coworker?	I know this has been asked before, but most of the questions seem to be for more professional positions.  Here's the deal, I have had a crush on one of my coworkers since about the first week that I worked, over 4 months ago.  For about half of this time, I was still getting over a relationship, but now that I feel comfortable dating again, I want to ask my coworker out.      I'm an 18 year old guy, and she's either 17 or 18 (we're both HS seniors) and we work at a pizza shop.  I also got an offer to become a manager about a month ago, which I will do this summer, and I'm not sure if that will become a problem. In my previous relationship, my gf and I were involved in an activity where gf/bf stuff was inappropriate, and we handled that pretty well.  I'm just wondering if I should go for it since I'll only be working there for another 6 months or should I let it go and continue looking?      As far as I know this is not against company policy, but my manager was no help when I asked her.
20080329015717AAoXTgG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We've played a lot of childish snooping games in the past.. now what?	Been dating for years. Sometimes in my presence hed pick up my phone and read my texts out loud. I was a little bothered by them being publicized and when he didnt stop when I asked Id do the same to him. This was all amicable to me. maybe he had ulterior motives but I never had anything to hide      Stopped for a year. then I caught him phone snooping when he thought I was sleeping in Nov. 1st times didnt bother me but he kept going. Confronted him (no fight): he either stopped or got better at it. In a moment of insecurity I snooped his phone 3 weeks ago (hed been getting weird calls and acting uncharacteristically defensive). Didnt think much of it since hed done it to me 100x. Found subtleties, asked him about it, he cursed me out and yelled, said my snooping's unacceptable but his isnt.      ALL other factors say not cheating (no room to list). I hate to think we cant get past this, he didnt care 2mos ago. That was my 1 moment of doubt, i DO trust him. thoughts/similar experiences?

We are going to do something next Saturday, after he finishes work at 4.      I've heard a lot of people mention bowling and movies but unfortunately I went bowling with him and a bunch of friends last week, so we can't do that one again for a while. We discussed going out to a movie, but he didn't like that idea, and there are no movies either of us are interested in right now.      This is my first boyfriend, so I have no idea how these things go. I can tell he is really nervous, he's never had a girlfriend either.      Some ideas for our first date would be great, thanks. Please keep in mind that both of us are only 16, and can't drive yet. As well, this is kind of like a tester date, to see if it will actually work out.      Thanks a lot.

Lately she hasn't really she has been kinda dull and there is a lot of silent moments when we are together. I guess I want her to talk more and be more open with me sometimes.

When we have fun it's great, but i have no idea why i'm insecure. This girl loves me to death, but I get scared of that.

Desejo-te tempo, para ter novas esperan?as e para amar(!!!)      N?o faz mais sentido protelar.
20080707195121AAGmx8c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i know if he is the one?	He lives three hours away. But in the time we've been together I always melt when I'm around him. He tells me he loves me but I've been holding back because of the distance. It's so hard right now to go see each other and I don't know when I will see him again.      I'm was watching the bachlorette (I'm sorry I'm the WORST speller) and I couldn't stop thinking about him and wishing I could be with him forever.      I'm really scared of getting hurt again.   I'm holding back but how do I know when to let go and just go for it ?

You see, I would REALLY like a purity ring, and my bff and I were planning on getting them ever since we heard that the one group we both really like (Jonas Brothers) wears purity rings. It symbolizes my religion. My mom and I are really close, but I'm afraid if I tell her something as big as my promise of purity, she will laugh at me, or at the very least tell everyone and humiliate me without really meaning to. I would show everyone my ring when I got it, but still. I found a really cute one that I can afford, but I don't know how to tell my mother about it. Please help!

I live in a different state and he keeps trying to contact me in various ways.  I am married and he is married.

It wasn't a problem being friends with him until recently.  He keeps telling me he should have married me and not her.  I had a dream about him last night.  Every time my hubby and I fight i think about how my life could have been different if I had married him.      I love my husband and I would never cheat.  This is driving me crazy.  I am starting to have feelings for my ex again.  And I feel like that is emotional infidelity.  I told my ex to never try to speak to me again.  And now I miss talking to him.

I've been with my 'boyfriend' 5 years, and we've been having problems, so we are seeing other people (3 weeks ago)   About 8 months ago, this guy came in to my work to make a delivery. He kept coming back pretty often, and innocently smiling at me, asking nice questions. He is 33 and i am 25.   He mentioned that it wasn't his route, he was a lead, but kept coming in because of me. Over the past 8 months, he has innocently flirted with me on a regular basis, little comments. My hair looked nice, etc. I could tell he wanted my # and I brought my boyfriend into the conversation. He asked, "Are you happy?"  in front of everyone at work, and once asked why i stood for him not marrying me. And if ever wanted kids.   Just lots of little sweet stuff, that made me blush, and when my boyfriend and i started having problems, i asked for his #    He hinted that I should leave him and we talked a couple times, he seemed so sweet, and i asked him out. does it seem like hes just    after sex?

20080822150834AAWR7Y4	Family & Relationships;Friends	COMO COME?A a AMIZADE? Para vocês, meus amigos?	Toda amizade é uma história particular. é uma história de conquista.      Primeiro, descobre-se o outro. Todo mundo parece igual, mas n?o é. E é justamente essa coisinha diferente em cada um que torna cada pessoa única. E de repente ali está a sementinha da amizade fecundada. A gesta??o come?a.   S?o pedacinhos de nós que v?o ficando nas conversas e pedacinhos do cora??o do outro que v?o caminhando para dentro da gente.    Há os risos e os sorrisos, a partilha de coisas simples ou de coisas importantes.   As descobertas, cheias de surpresas muitas vezes.   A voz calada que pensa, n?o diz nada...adivinha!    Fazemos idéia imediata de uma pessoa ao primeiro contato. Julgamos? Talvez. E só os próximos dias, horas ou instantes v?o nos dizer se julgamos certo. Acontece de nos enganarmos em certos pontos e quantas vezes n?o bendizemos isso!...   Quando descobrimos um palhacinho por detrás de uma pessoa séria e reservada é maravilhoso saber que pudemos nos enganar.   A sensibilidade do outro nos toca. Dá até vontade de chorar. N?o sabemos direito o porquê de nos sentirmos próximos de alguém assim t?o longe, t?o diferente e t?o igual. Mas amizade, como o amor, n?o se questiona. Vive-se. Dela e para ela.   é preciso dar tempo ao tempo para se saber cativar e ser cativado. Quando saímos às pressas sempre temos o risco de deixar alguma coisa esquecida. Mas se tivermos tempo de olhar bem, refletir, conversar, conversar e conversar... e rir e brincar e ficar em silêncio!...   Se deixarmos que essa flor nas?a cuidadosa e docemente... aos poucos ela vai vendo a luz do dia. Maravilhando-se.   Contemplando o outro com novos olhos, ou nova maneira de olhar. Tudo vira encanto!    Que o outro ria de mim ou para mim, mas que ria!   Gargalhe, fa?a festa!... Que eu seja um pouco responsável por esse rosto iluminado, por essa vontade de viver e de ver o que virá depois.   Bendita seja essa gesta??o amiga! Sem prazo, sem tempo, sem hora marcada! Bendita seja essa amizade, prova de que Deus se faz conhecer através das pessoas que alcan?am nosso cora??o.      LUZ!   Autoria? Desconhe?o         
20080903155730AA3mhs4	Family & Relationships;Friends	POSSO CONTAR UMA ESTORINHA aos meus amigos...? V?o ter paciência de ler? ?	Era uma vez um garoto que tinha um temperamento muito explosivo. Um dia ele recebeu um saco cheio de pregos e uma placa de madeira. O pai disse a ele que martelasse um prego na tábua toda vez que perdesse a paciência com alguém.    No primeiro dia o garoto colocou 37 pregos na tábua. Já nos dias seguintes, enquanto ele ia aprendendo a controlar sua raiva, o número de pregos martelados por dia foram diminuindo gradativamente.    Ele descobriu que dava menos trabalho controlar sua raiva do que ter que ir todos os dias pregar diversos pregos na placa de madeira... Finalmente chegou um dia em que o garoto n?o perdeu a paciência em hora alguma.    Ele falou com seu pai sobre seu sucesso e sobre como estava se sentindo melhor em n?o explodir com os outros e o pai sugeriu que ele retirasse todos os pregos da tábua e que a trouxesse para ele. O garoto ent?o trouxe a placa de madeira, já sem os pregos, e a entregou a seu pai.   Ele disse: "Você está de parabéns, meu filho, mas dê uma olhada nos buracos que os pregos deixaram na tábua......ela nunca mais será como antes".    Quando você diz coisas estando com raiva, suas palavras deixam marcas como essas. Você pode enfiar uma faca em alguém e depois retira-la. N?o importa quantas vezes você pe?a desculpas, a cicatriz ainda continuará lá. Uma agress?o verbal é tao ruim quanto uma agress?o física.    “Amigos s?o como joias raras. Eles te fazem sorrir e te encorajam para alcan?ar o sucesso. Eles te emprestam o ombro, compartilham dos teus momentos de alegria... e sempre querem ter seus cora??es abertos para você."   Eu considero você um amigo(a)... Eu me sinto honrado(a) por isto; e...   ...e me desculpe... ...ME PERDOE, se eu já deixei alguma marca na sua tábua.      CAMPANHA PAZ NO YR!   LUZ!

If so, do you still like the chase once you get the girl? Meaning do you still like know that you have her, but gotta keep working to get her, or would you rather her to just give in? Also, if you do like the chase, what's the best way for a girl to keep you on your toes? Please post useful responses, not just yes and no answers. Tell me why you say yes and no.
20081014192839AAp1lAc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am the other woman?	Before you begin to judge me, listen to me.       I've recently started seeing a man who I care very deeply for. We have an intimate relationship but we both know it could never go anywhere. There are certain circumstances that cannot be changed that just will never allow us to be together wholly. (Neither of us are married but he does have a girlfriend and two small children with her. He stays with her for the kids and has not promised to leave her. It is not one of those situations. Also, I am moving 1200 miles away in two months)       I have such strong feelings for this man, but in reality I know it will never turn into the relationship I dream it would.       I also am not sure if this man feels as deeply for me as I do for him. I don't want to stop seeing him, I love every minute we spend together. What should I do? Should I continue to be in a relationship I know will never go anywhere, even though I love the time spent with him? Please any advice!

20081014195600AAEmXGs	Family & Relationships;Family	How would you feel if this was your mom?	I am 25 years old, My mom has always been a very nervous person she was a single parent, as a child even playing with a toy or listing to a song I like, was concerned get on her nervous and I was ask to stop. I feel she wasn't really there for me emotionally I kinda always felt alone. When she was mad at me she would hit the wall and I swear she sounded like a demon, her voice would get very demonic sounding this was when I was a child. As an adult when I was 18 my mom and i worked at the same restaurant a rumor started going around that I was sleeping with this guy I would talk to at work problem is I wasn't and instead of my mom asking about it she called me a slut. when we got hit with hurricane Rita we went to Florida we were going to barbecue and she asked me what sides I wanted I told her i didn't want any so she got mad and push the buggy really hard the buggy went flying she went to her car and waited for Me and my husband when we got back to the condo she stomped upstairs and slammed the door. I thought at this point something I never thought but I seriously thought she was nuts, I didn't talk to her for the rest of the night I though maybe she would be acting different in the morning but she wasn't and I got mad and said a few words and then i told her she could just leave, bad thing was we went in her car we were 3 states away from home so I know it was stupid to say you can leave but you just don't think your mom would do that to you so she left and I had 2 catch a bus back home we had 2 buy 6 suitcases and 2 tickets to get home, later she said the reason she was mad was because she said i was being inconsiderate when i said i didn't want any sides for the barbecue, I told her that i didn't feel that way because I didn't say she couldnt have any I just answered what she asked me. a few month latter I was sitting on the couch and she had my step uncle over he was on the phone, her shirt had a button missing so I told her and she got in my face and started screaming "don't worry about my shirt" I got very embarrassed in front of the company and I said a lot of bad things after that and then I moved out we were supposed to rent to own her house but I just left, now we kinda made up and I moved back in after a year and half of being gone she drives me crazy every time she opens her mouth, she gambles nonstop it started when I was 13 and she doesn't work now all she does is gamble she stays Mon-wed at the hotel/casino eats at the restaurant everyday and gambles all the time, gambling is all she talks about it all she cares about. she is renting to own the house to us because she wanted a travel trailer to live in cause she said she doesn't want any responsibilities but still has them as her trailer was messed up from the new hurricane ike, she now says she wants to live under a bridge and that she wants to live like a gypsy. I have paid too much into this house to just leave again and we have a couple of years before she moves her trailer somewhere else. A few months ago I told her I was getting another dog and she screams out that i am pissing her off so I left her trailer and wrote her a letter I let everything out and I demanded respect from her because she doesn't act like she respects me at all she lives in the travel trailer , on the property that we are renting to own from her we have agreed to allowed her to stay her for 2 years. When I asked for respect she wrote a letter back and said that I was heartless because I said that she is just a guest at our home and she shouldn't be disrespecting us. The things I wrote on here are just the Major issues there are to many to write on here. So here lately I have been not felling much for my mom sometimes I even think I hate her, and I also feel that it not human of me to hate her but I dint know how i should feel. If this was your mom how would you feel? Am I a bad person for not really liking my mom?   
20061018101819AAgFiXa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to know if a girl is interested. Help!?	There is this girl I like that is in my classes. I've started sitting next 2 her(a few weeks ago) and once I even gave her a teddy bear(3weeks ago) and I’ve been really nice 2 her without her acting different in any way. But in the last few days (the end of last week and now) I’ve noticed that she’s acting differently around me even asking me if she could keep the pen she borrowed from me (Thursday of last week). Just so you know she hasn’t given me back the pen. When she said bye on Thursday to me she started to say it in that I like u-ish tone. I’m not sure if these signs are enough to qualify as her liking me so I was planning to say to her “You have a beautiful smile” How should she react (what should she say or do) for me 2 find out if she is interested or even likes me? I'm asking this cause this the 1st gurl i've been interested in.(I'm 17, she's 18 or 19) Also how do i say it without coming on too strong?

20081025202011AAGf65m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do with a husband who is emailing other women on the internet?	We recently got a laptop.  Two weeks ago my husband discovered how to use chat rooms and email.  However, I have acess to his emails but he doesn't know it.  He is meeting women in chat rooms who live in other countries and getting their phone numbers.  I have read one message where a lady gave him her number and he wrote to her saying she gave him the wrong number because he tried to call it.        Also, I have set up a fake profile of a lady and started emailing him and after like 3 emails he has asked me for my phone number so we can chat on the phone.      I don't know what to make of this.  I have always trusted him but right now I'm FUMING.        We've been married 11 yeears and have four children.

20090222224407AAdrEFw	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my mom always piss me off?	Okie, For some reason my mom and me never got along. Once in a while yea we are okie without yelling at each other, but most of the time we always yell and bit*h at each other. I don't get why my mom and I are like this. For some reason we never got along. My dad and I we are always laughing and my mom and I we are always yelling. I don't understand why it is like this. I know I am not the perfect daugher but thats just how everyone is. No one can be perfect. And sometimes when I try to make things work and not get into a fight with her, she always starts to yell. She says "O, I'm not yelling thats just how I talk, LOUD" And I'm like WHAT!!! she talks so loud and shes not even a feet away from me! I think thats stupid! I really don't know what to do. I am 18 and live at home while going to school. I really want to move out, but I know if I do my mom will bit*h and yell even more. And I don't think my dad wants me to move out because I am the youngest and a girl. I just can't stand my mom anymore! I don't know what to do, can anyone give me advise what I should do? How can I stop fighting with my mom?       P.S. My mom isn't the type of person who will reason. If she thinks its right she won't listen to anyone else. She trusts her friends over her own family. So stupid....

20081014172319AAnjZZy	Family & Relationships;Family	Mother / (adult) son issues?	Many have this problem but I'm estranged from my mother for many reasons. My mother is in her 80's, good health and married in a second marriage to a saint, he's wonderful but during the last 15 years of marriage to my wife, she has done nothing to further a mother-in-law relationship, and has also drifted from me due to me not keeping the relationship going 100%. My wife just finished 3 years of severe treatments for Stage 3 breast cancer, and we only had one note from my mother (a prayer card), plus a call to my mother-in-law which was more of a venting call about her second husband. I am extremely sad that she has not taken my wife's potentially fatal illness seriously, even if it meant I mad all the calls, but she has no interest at all. Plus there is more, IE I'm the youngest of many boys and feel that I was left behind b/c I was not local when my wonderful Dad died and I did not receive almost any sentimental items of his, let alone any of his valuables (though I so preferred the paintings he did and so on). My question is this: What do I do? Do I try to re-initiate contact after about 3 years of no contact, and many hurt feelings, from another city? I'm afraid to be hurt again, and generally don't feel I have the want nor the time to be hurt yet again. Can anyone offer realistic suggestions? Background, I have one brother still close to her but the rest all dropped communications with her as she tends to do a lot of lying and it becomes tiresome not knowing what to believe about her life. I am grateful for any thoughts you can send my way on this - thanks!

One day she caught him kissing her best friend and he told her that she had something on the side of her lips and she forgave him but their relationship got even more distant. She came to me balling crying asking me what to do. I helped her. Long story I helped her and she fell in love with his best friend and i fell in love with her. She knows that I have feelings for her and I know she has feelings for me. Should I forget about her and slowly break off from her or say that its just a phase and get over it?

I'll have a friend of mine there already ahead of time. He's got six roses that I bought and had him hold. We arrange that a spot where I take my girl, and we sit down, start chatting. Meanwhile, my friend with the roses is at a certain place not too far away. He finds 5 other people passing by and kindly asks them if they could go and give a rose to my girlfriend and wish her "Happy Birthday so-and-so" and walk away. My friend gives the last rose after all five people have, and I finish with the last six roses. Probably chocolates too.      Now...my question is (after telling my friend he wonders this too) would it be too creepy to have 5 strangers do it? (mind you he'd pick friendly looking pople) ....      or...should I get 5 other friends to do it?       The latter involves some convincing though. Girls, would you think that 5 strangers would be creepy? Do you think this is a good birthday idea at all? I need insight, thanks.

20081116225955AAytKH9	Family & Relationships;Family	?mi hogar es insoportable...me quiero mudar pero no se como?	resulta que mi padre es de esas personas que les gusta que uno los endiose, por lo que me contaron algunos de mis familiares el desde joven fue una persona que siempre quiso algo asi como esclavizar a sus hermanos menores y ya me lo imaginaba, ahora no le gusta ver que sus hijos estan siendo más libres ni que esten mejorando en sus estudios, y ahora el tambien se mete con mi abuelita diciendo que no me deja en paz solo porque me sirve mi comida y me ayuda a lavar mi ropa yo puedo hacer mis cosas sola pero ella lo unico que quiere es ayudar y mi papa le paga mal todavia que ella lo ayuda a atender a sus hijos, mi papa tambien se ha metido con mi tio cuando mi tio le prestaba dinero a mi papa para que el pague nuestro colegio y algunos otros gastos le ha dado una casa donde vivio sin pagar alquiler por 5 a?os y encima  mi papa no le devolvia el dinero que le pedia prestado, ahora mi papa encima le pide a mi tio como $5700 dolares y como mi tio no le puede seguir prestando luego que mi papa le debe tanto dinero y no le quiere pagar ahora mi papa rompio con mi tio solo por eso, a mi abuelita le pidio que nos cuidara cuando estabamos peque?os ella acepto y nos cuido y ahora mi papa le paga quejandose del modo en que ella nos cuido! ahora mi papa se entero que saque buena nota en el examen parcial de un curso y nisiquiera se alegro ni me dijo ''muy bien hijita'', a mi abuelita sabiendo que era su cumplea?os porque la felicite en su cara de el, se hace el que se olvido y el dia siguiente la felicita pero con mala cara como si ella le hiciera algo a el, y todavia le hizo el discurso ese de que ''madre deja en paz a mis hijos'' dejar en paz pero de q??? si ella no nos hace nada, ahora el todavia se da el lujo de tener dos mujeres en su misma casa, y la nueva mujer (no reconocida por mi papa) ahora cree disponer de todas las cosas de mi casa y mi papa tambien le pedimos por ejemplo que nos compre una botella de yogurt y el va y no nos compra pero si se compra para el solo, mi abuelita le dice que debio comprarnos a nosotros tambien y mi papa le contesto feo, la nueva mujer ahora para desayunar come un tremendo plato de sopa y mi papa se queja si nosotros comemos bastante al hijo de ella le compran un alimento especial y si el ni?o no quiere comerlo su mama se lo ataruga el chico esta bien panzon de tanto que lo hace tragar y hacen que nosotros comamos solo una lonja de carne con arroz, lo juzga a mi hermano de cosas que el tambien hace solo que mi papa las hace peor, lo hace reventar a mi hermano para que mi hermano explote le diga algo fuerte por la colera y asi mi papa creerse con derecho a pegarnos o gritarnos, quiero salirme de esa casa mi abuelita dice que puedo vivir en la casa de ella y yo ya soy mayor de edad pero no se como salirme de ahi, hablar con el es inutil porque si le decimos algo se pone furioso y nos amenaza, ya que mi papa para colmo hasta se pondria en la puerta para que no salga pienso salirme aunque sea por la ventana pero salirme, pero no se que le voy a decir cuando haga eso y no se como afrontar el conflicto que se vendria por el hecho de quererme salir de esa casa para irme a vivir con mi abuelita si el se quiere meter a la casa de mi abuelita por la fuerza?? si lo dejo entrar tengo temor de que le haga algo a mi abuelita o que pelee fuerte conmigo mi abuelita esta mortificada por todo esa forma como mi papa nos trata ayudenme a afrontar esto por favor
20081120094858AA75Itu	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel totally intimidated and jealous of my best friend, advice?	My best friend is gorgeous, she's hardly ever single and always gets hit on, always ! She always seems to be in control of situations and it bothers everyone. I'm her only girl mate (I'm guessing no other girls like her because of all this) It's quite clear I don't compare at all to her appearance which can obviously make me pretty jealous at times. All the boyfriend's I've had have liked her before me, and when she's either done with them or just not interested then they come to me.    You're probably wondering why I'm actually still her friend. Well when it's just us two (no guys around) She's a totally amazing friend.      Can anyone give me any advice on how not to be soo jealous of her ?   It's really bothering me lately and depressing me from even going out with her anymore.

20060717090515AA6HLip	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i just see what happens??? wit my bros girl?	i think I went to middle school wit her, and we werent very interested in eachother. NOw she is dating my older brother and has been for the past two years. They live together. When we hang out we kinda flirt, but never do ANYTHING. She is a good gf to my brother, even after he cheated on her. But my brother has never treated any of his ex's the way he treats her. And they werent very good to him. Sometimes i find myself strongly disliking her, but when she is not with my brother and we go to the store or something i really like her. I have a gf and have been with her since middle school, and feel like i am cheatin on her when i am around my brothers girlfriend. But i like to hang out with them cuz she is really fun to party wit and just hang out with. When i get drunk tho i start to flirt alot, i try touchin her and i try to get her to sleep wit me, but she never does, cuz we are always with my brother. i feel like she wants to but she doesnt show any signs. is this wrong? or not?

Someone who knows the difference between a minor and a major chord!!! Hahahaha, I'm gonna post this now, even though I feel really stupid.

We have an agreement that he may go to the strip clubs with the guys for a bach party, but he is not allowed to come home after some hooker got him reved up and expect me to take care of it. Well he did that this past Saturday night, after he promised that would never happen. I asked him some questions and he refused to answer them. He told me I need to be carefull what I ask as my feeling may get hurt. He told me that he did not enjoy lap dances, and I asked him than why are you wasting money buying them? I was pissed and my feelings were hurt, because he was trying to pull off my shirt in public like I was some piece of trash while he was drunk. So I hauled of and smacked him and he got a black eye. Which I do not feel bad about. He got cought in quite a few lies, Why not just tell me the truth so the situation can be over with? Does he have something to hide or am I just reading to much into it. Why Will not tell me if he is getting a hard-on from some hooker?? How disgusting!!

Hoy a 6 a?os de mi elección, me felicito. Resultó ser un excelentísimo padrino. Siempre viene a visitarla, me reta si ve q la estoy malcriando, me guía en temas de psicología infantil (el sabe mucho, lee mucho), le ense?a de a poco lo q sabe (computacion, inglés, pintura, danza, etc).

Sin desconocer que los bordes no existen, es decir, nadie está solo íNTEGRAMENTE por obligación o por elección, pero si experimentan tendencias hacia uno de los polos; quisiera saber a modo de “encuesta” el porqué se encuentran solas.   Con “obligación” me refiero a que se enamoren pero el chico en cuestión no les haga caso, o no estén enamoradas pero tampoco aparezca ningún “candidato” (disculpen el término pero fue el primero que me vino a la cabeza! Ja!).   Con “elección” me refiero a que existan chicos interesados en ustedes pero por amor a la soltería o lisa y llanamente porque no entra en sus planes conscientemente elijan estar solas.   La pregunta viene a colación de que noto que mis amigas y yo estamos solteras y que últimamente me topo con muchas chicas solas, y me pregunto si es un fenómeno accidental o intencional, es decir, que definitivamente las mujeres están mejor y más contentas solas...

I will like to ask you a question. Why did you kiss me? I will just like to know the reason you did these couple of times. I forgot to ask you the day we talked   I assume that you will ask the same thing me. Do you want to know why I kiss you? Because I like like, I admitted and the true is that I don't know why, you are a good guy, but there are other good guys around and I don't feel the same thing with them.    In love or not, I don't know it myself, and I am not in hurry to know it either. Its something I should mature on. But I can tell one that the reason I kissed you is because I like how you kiss, I don't even know if it has something to do with that. The true is that when I kiss you I feel more than a touch of your lips, is this current in my whole body that makes me feel i another planet. And this happen to me very rarely with other people. With the mentioned above, I think you understand what I am saying right? No more explanations then...

Ella tiene una hija mas o menos de ocho anos y la nina se encarino mucho con el y hasta lo llama papa. Despues el me busco y regresamos, pero la nina lo busca mucho y yo lo entiendo porque al fin y al cabo es una nina y ella no tiene la culpa de los errores de las personas, pero ahora no se que hacer porque el dijo que se iba ir apartando poco a poco de la nina para que no se sintiera tan mal, pero ya ha pasado bastante tiempo y no hay resultados de que el se este apartando de ella y yo ya no se si es realmente por la nina o por la mama, porque el siempre visita a la nina en su casa y es obvio de que la mama esta con ella.   No se que pensar, porque el me dice que  me quiere a mi y no a ella y que por eso esta con migo y no con ella, pero que es dificil apartarce de la nina porque su mama al parecer le mete ideas a la nina y ella se aferra mucho a el.

20070405160335AAaqQFo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know when a guy has lost interest in you as more then a friend?	In the last few months my relationship with a certain hunky from down under has been kinda strained as we have both been under some stress in our individual lives.  I try to be there for him as best I can but it seems that now he is pulling away.  He hasn't lied to me that I know of, but I get this weird feeling that he is no longer interested in being more then friends.  Maybe that there might even be someone else he is interested in.  How do I know for sure.  I have asked him safe questions, but don't dare ask the "relationship" questions anymore or he is sure to run the other direction.  How do I get his interest back? Should I play like I don't care? I hate playing games, but I don't know what else to do.. Can anyone help?

20070606194000AAzl4jv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Any Americans living in Delhi who can give me advice?	Hi!  I'm moving to Delhi next year and will be marrying a man there.  He's a great man and I really love him. He's very good to me.  However, in my last visit, some apparent cultural differences showed up and it was harder for me than it had been in previous visits.  He's never been out of the country and rarely even out of Northern India...he doesn't really understand what it's like for me and his English is not quite good enough for me to explain it.  So, when I come, I am a bit overwhelmed with all the differences and I have no one to talk to about it to help me process (I process change best by talking it out).  So - if anyone can give me advice - ESPECIALLY American ladies married to Indian men...well that would be great.  If you can tell me stories of your experiences and what was hard for you to get used to and how you coped, I'd really appreciate it.  I really want to learn more before I go back.  Thanks! :)

My ex boyfreind was really good looking, all my freinds thought he was hot! we are both 18 and our relationship was always on and off.. and last night i found out he has fallin for one of his school friends. I know he found me very attractive, all his mates thought i was hot.... so he kept me away from them all.  He likes this other gurl because of her personality not physical beauty that much. We never spent much time with each other because we allways had something on. Im still hung up on him even though i have other guys after me, but i'm not interested in them.  Whats the best way to get revenge on him? i want it to be a jealousy way though... do you think we would have a chance together again? i cant talk things out with him cuz he isnt open and his ego would just go up.

Pero si por el contrario los dos luchamos juntos y por alguna razón de peso mi hombre no pudiese llevar dinero a la casa entonces yo no tendria problemas en llevar la economia a la casa, pero solo por un tiempo razonable...porque yo creo en la igualdad de generos...no cada cual por su lado.

I suffer from major depressive disorder and am having a bad spell.  Left a msg for my doc and no return call.  Therapist is out of town.  No suicidal but can barely get out of bed.  Not even motivated to turn out TV.  Barely motivated to get online except I guess I just want someone, even one person to care, even if its someone I don't even know.  It feels like the loneliness emptiness feeling in the world.  I can't work b/c of health reasons and my friends are tied up with their own issues.  I'm not even motivated to do anything about it as hard as I try.  Please do not make fun of me.  I don't even think I could handle that right now.  Thanks for reading this far.

20070522131345AALPtCI	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm in need of some help, please...?	Well this morning I called my mom to tell I would be over later in the afternoon with my son. She then proceedes to still come over to my apartment early in the morning to get my son(she did call but I was asleep). My son was asleep so I told her to just wait until this afternoon and then she goes flying out of my bedroom telling my grandmother Mary that I refused to give her my son. I never said that! My grandmother Mary stormed out cusing and my mom left crying. So I called my moms phone and left a very nasty message. Yes I know that I was wrong and I told my mother I was sorry. But she will not listen, now she has proceeded to tell me she is not going to help out with her grandson and that she is packing all his toys out of her house. The last time I talk to her I told her I would come over tommorow to just let things cool down. I told her I was sorry and that I loved her but she said whatever bye. Everyone in my family is very angry with me. Any advice would be nice..

I'm Arabic originally and I have had offers from some American guys they're cute and sweet etc.. but I have a problem         First, I've never had sex and I won't without marriage      two I don't drink  ... believe it or not I'm like 21 and never tasted alcohol ... I just don't like the idea of guetting drunk I feel it's not calssy not knowing what you're saying, and acting silly..         Three I'm very quiet, soft spoken, I enjoy being around people but I'm not a wild girl or big party person...      I feel that these differences and a other things are stopping me from having a relationship with an American guy, because as far as I know they must have sex, they like to drink every saturday night and they like to party.. The simple fact that I can't give him sex makes me feel like I'm doing him wrong... He'll be deprived of something he needs or he'll cheat on me...      what do I do ?

I like him sooo muh but heres a few stories for you to see what its like between us.      At school in one lesson, there was this lad and lass who go out.    I said to the lad I like 'awww arn't they cute'    Then he pulled me by the waist and said 'awww arn't we cute'    Then the lad and lass who go out kissed    So I said 'but I arn't going to kiss you'    And the lad I like said 'well why not'    So as I walked away I said 'because your taken'    This Was When He Was With His girlfriend ! ! ! ! !      On msn one night we were talking.    He was saying how much he loved his girlfriend.    So I said 'you cant love her properly, because you realy need to get to know someone before you realy love them'    So he said 'so you dont love me ?'    I - 'Dont ask me that'    he - 'Do you love me'    I - 'DONT ask me that'    he - 'Just tell me'    I - 'You want to know something'    he - 'Yes'    I - 'If I loved you everytime I'd look at your display picture and my heart would be ripped out, stampped on and ripped up. But because of how much I loved you, it would manage to put it self back 2geva again and love you some more. And everytime it put its self back 2geva I would love you some more.    he - I'll change it then    (he changed his dp from him and his girlfriend huggin to just him)    I - Why did you change it?    he - Because you love me       - The next day him and his girlfriend broke up       Can everyone who reads this tell me exactly what you think of this.

20080324001833AAx9H3S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship disagreements?	My partner and I strongly disagree with respect to religious views, meaning of life views, and politics. She means so much to me and I know I mean a lot to her, but she won't date me because she insists that it wouldn't work due to our debates on just a few issues.      How can I let her know that I respect her views, and that I love her for who she is and what she believes in?      Is she right? Would our relationship not work?
20080328010716AANcRFE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I was thinking about changing for a girl I like, what are some options?	Theres this girl I really like and I have mutual friends and I hear them talking about what they like. For instance, the girl I like said she likes guys that aren't too fat or too skinny and wear clothes that fit them.      Should I start buying clothes that fit me and start working? I am a shorter than most average guys at the age 15. I am thinking about running to grow and stretch my body and buy clothes to look good. I barely talk to this girl because I am shy and I am asking for your input on if I am going too far since I barely talk to her.      If you say she isn't worth it... blah blah blah... please don't say that. I've been thinking about this a lot and I've concluded that she is worth it.         I would give my life for her if I had to. I am not just saying this and I've really thought about it. I've had this crush for 5 years.

20080328233851AAPqrEv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Afraid I am overwhelming her...?	Ok, so a long backstory short, This girl liked me a year and a half ago when I was a senior in HS, and she was a junior in HS. I was a jerk and led her on for a month or two before she figured it out... she got mad and we stayed "friends" for a few months, because we were on the cross country team and had a few small classes together. However, we had an argument and didn't speak to each other for a period of months... now about three months after I led her on, I started to have feelings for her... genuine feelings. I really care about and love this girl, and it really hurt me when she decided to end our friendship.       Anyway, a week ago I decided to apologize, and I told her that I really did like her, and that I was a fool for what I did. She accepted my apology, but it seems like she is trying to make up her mind about me... she is sending mixed signals... on one hand she changed a few things in her profile to say like " I'm waiting for you to be the one", and stuff like that, but

Maybe I have a midterm tomorrow, or a lab, or just homework to do. Whatever the case, she doesn't care. I was not so lucky to come from a wealthy family and college is coming out of my pocket, so I sure as hell wouldn't get a bad grade just so I could talk to her, when we would just talk the next night. The problem is, her dad is a millionaire, and she can't understand where I'm coming from. I mean sh1t, college is 4 years, and if she really wants to be together we will have the rest of our lives. Why won't she just let me do my thing for 4 years, and then she can have me 100% after? I just don't understand and I don't know what to do. You input on the situation?

20090222212023AAAcLpw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think he will ever love anyone, or is he too jaded?	My friend who I love (we were involved a couple of years ago but he got really depressed and felt guilty so I was there as his friend because he honestly couldn't handle a relationship), seems to be pretty jaded. He's had about 3 or 4 serious relationships which ended with "getting his heart ripped out". So whenever there's a romantic movie on TV he changes the channel. He's never told me he loves me to my face, he said it on the phone one night though, and left a message on my mobile when I was out of town telling me about his night and said "love you" at the end. I've never said it to him, I have to stop myself sometimes because I get so overwhelmed by this feeling I have for him. Do you think he's afraid to love because of getting hurt before, or maybe he just doesn't love me?
20081102135619AAbyjLn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get him back before it's too late?	Sorry if this is a little long.. I met this guy 3 years ago who lives quite far away. We are (or were..) planning to get together and see how things go in about a year and a half (after I graduate). We agreed that until then, we should see other people, and now he has a girlfriend and they aren't too serious he says. It caused sooo much hurt and stress for me though, and then for him because I was always upset about it. We constantly fought. So he told me that he couldn't handle it anymore and won't talk to me.      Basically, similar things have happened in the past where one of us gets frustrated and needs a break (this has lasted like 5 months before). But this time I am really worried because I'm afraid I'll lose him before we get the chance to really be together.      What can I do to make sure he comes back to me? Or at least make sure we don't lose touch?

20090223003358AAxRX3U	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm in a really 'weird' situation, don't know what to do.. PLEASE help!?	First of all, if you're either going to be inappropriate or give me an irrelevant/unnecessary/insulting answer then you can just quit go away.       Anyway heres the problem:    Basically my dad passed away afew months ago. And we're moving houses, so me & my younger sister (age 12) were looking for the keys to his electric guitar case. Well we searched.    To put a long story short, she came across the cupboards with all the important documents which we were supposed to keep out, and she looked in there.    Afterwards, she came to me looking weird, and told me she found a porn cd?! I felt really weird considering    1) we're christians so erm adultery is a 'sin'   2) my mum always tells me to stay away from porn etc...      Then at night my sis told my mum something was bothering her, but she didnt say what. She told me she was going to tell my mum that she had found it, but i told her not to. So instead she told my mum that she had gotten a detention because of a low score.   So they kinda got in a fight (not going to go into details why)      and now, i don't know whether i should tell my mum what was really bothering her, like the porn CD my sister found, or just leave the whole thing? Because i feel really weird, and i'm scared how my mum will react.       thanks so much if you bothered reading, sorry its longwinded.

20090223014831AA0ydlX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce versus Same Sex Marriage?	It doesn't affect me any way other than that i have to see and hear about protests on the news all the time.   Its during one of these broadcast that i noticed people holding up "SAVE MARRIAGE" signs.  that got me thinking,  Gays aren't trying to destroy marriage,  they just want the right to get married.  So the protesters should be marching for a constitutional ban against divorce not another form of marriage.  and since the only people who seem concerned about it is us "Christians",  we should know that divorce is a sin,  even more so since adultery is in the 10 commandments,  after divorce all intimate relationships are consider adultery even after 2nd marriage.  Any way,  I believe the bible says before you tend to the mote in your neighbors eye,  tend to the beam in yours.      STOP BITCHING ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE. STOP DIVORCE!!!   opinions please.

20090222221314AAIfQG1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girls, what can I do to drive her crazy???   [kinda long]?	My girlfriend and I have been dating about 3 months, and we started getting kinda serious about 2 weeks ago. And this weekend we went to the movies and afterwards we parked and got in the back and started making out.      I fingered her and after awhile, she leaned back and I lifted up her shirt and yea.... She seemed like she liked it quite a bit, and after awhile, i started fingering while doing tht and I think I made her *** because she told me 'right there' and i sped up and after awhile she told me to stop and she was moaning so yeaa.      We did tht for like 2 hours, and then I drove her home. Im pretty sure she'd be willing to reciprocate but i dont know how exactly to ask her to.      I really care about her alot, and I respect her, and I honestly think I love her, and we both said it 2 weeks ago. And I want her to have fun, without going to far or making her feel uncomfortable. Were both virgins and we both agreed on waiting for quite awhile, so anything besides that is open for thought.      We were joking around and she mentioned something about me biting her, and after apologizing, i said something about 'You could push me farther, if you'd like' and she wasnt expecting it and said she'd have to think about it. <- she kinda pushed me to her chest, and yea, said farther as in yea.      She told me I left an enormous hickey on her boob, and we were joking about it, and i bit her nipple on accident[i have braces] :\ lol, and she told me she liked everything but tht part so ill just have to remember tht.      And about the head issue.... im self conscious.. Im kinda bigger so i dont look as big as I actually am. I am around 5.4-5 inches and around 4.5 around. But when I push down all the way im about 6' so idk... is this bad???         and a small question for the girls...?      - Any particular reason that she doesn't let me pull her underwear down when Im fingering her? It's kinda difficult for me to get a good angle sometimes. Im not pressuring her into letting me, im just asking about it.
20081025194202AAKqTeq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do if husband asked you to do something inappropriate ?	I don't know all of the details on how it works, but a friends husband asked her to chat on line with men to make money. Apparently you can make money by getting guys turned on enough to pay for time viewing a woman on web cams (she wouldn't be on the web cam, somebody else would you just make the guy believe he is going to see you) and her husband thought that would be a good way to make some extra cash. He was even starting to do it until she got upset. She told him that she thought it was a horrible idea and is hurt by his request. Her husband seems like a sweet guy and this shocked me (it shocked her too). What should I tell her when she asks if she is overreacting by being upset (she has brought it up a few times so I know it is really bothering her)? Why would a husband ever want his wife to do something like that?

20090223020017AARgMYi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he keep playing with me?	Me and my husband have been married 5 years. Since we were both very young. 20 and 18. We've been through horrible ups and downs. Recently he left the house and abandonded me when I was pregnant with our 3rd child and I needed him the most. The whole time he was gone I missed him dearly and tried to work things out. I think he was cheating on me though he will never admit it. After I found out alot of the things he did when he was gone I couldn't take it anymore and refused to let him come back and started a divorce. I still sadly love him so it pains me to do it but I know we're not meant to be in a relationship like this together. Not even a month after he left he got a gf which hurt and made it feel like we never had anything. He denys shes his gf to me and swears shes so fat and ugly. But I already saw their myspaces where shes claiming how much she loves him and wants to marry him. When he actually comes over to see the kids, he tells me shes not his gf and he trys to get all close with me and talks as if we're still together. Its taking a painfully long time for the divorce to go through and all of what hes doing is messing with me. Why would he pretend like this if shes really his gf? Its sick and it hurts me. I can't stand how she says shes so in love with him and then he comes and pretends like we're still happy together. I have to be nice to him for the sake of the kids, but how would you deal with this if you were in my situation? Only real helpful answers please.   Hes not pretending like we're together for the kids. Their not around when he trys to hug on me or put his arms around me or whatever else he thinks he can get away with that day.

En realidad siempre he sido una persona extrovertida, de esas que gritan y hacen reir a las personas. Siempre he sido así, pero desde hace un mes mas o menos me siento fatal. No puedo evitar pensar en que la unica persona con la que me sentia agusto (mi mejor amiga) me ha abandonado (Estamos peleadas), yo soy demasiado orgullosa para aceptar sus disculpas, simplemente no puedo dejar atras mi orgullo. El chico que me gusta dejo la escuela, mis compa?eros no ayudan mucho y cada vez me siento mas vacia y sola. Tomo Prozac desde hace unos meses y la verdad si estaba ayudando, pero lo he dejado desde que me siento así. No puedo permitirme ser dependiente de un medicamento. No se que hacer. Ayuda.
20080616180559AAec98N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex kissed me! after he broke up with me?	ok well he broke up with me and said he just wanted to be friends. then like a week later, he was on my golf cart with me and was flriting with me and all this stuff which i thought was weird and hes like u wanna play a game? and i said whats the game? and he said the nervous game. and he put his hand on my leg and was like i keep moving until u get nervous and theni stop and i said i dont feel comfortable with it bcuz we just broke up and hes like ok fine. so a little after that he stopped the golf cart and went in like he was going to kiss and and i touched his top lip and he pulled away and was like ha i tricked u. so then i was like whatever dont even talk to me now. so i wouldnt talk to him for like 5 min. then he stopped the golf cart again and turned my face towards his and started kissing me. like 3 sec. into the kiss he started using his tongue then i was like whoa im confused so hes like i wanna be friends with benefits. what should i do? i really like him and want him back!!
20080622201010AA7ocPK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you say I'm a jerk if....?	I've hated this guy since 5th grade and he's been doing a whole lot of stuff to make me hate him even more since then.  My x just broke up with me but i still kinda cared for her i guess, cause I can't really call it love.  My friend called me and told me that he saw my x and this guy hanging out after summer school behind the school.  So i hop in my car, cause I know this guy, he's after one thing and one thing only, u know what i mean.  So i get there and I go up to them and try to convince her of that.  The guy gets up and pushes me, i tell him to chill out, but he pushes me again and then he swings but misses and i punched him like 3 times, and he keeps on coming so I just flat out had to kick *** to get him to stop, i didn't want to, i had to.  Then my x starts screaming at me and calls me, CALLS ME THE JERK.  Who's really the f-ing jerk?  I just didn't want her being taken advantage of.  So then I left.

20081015093250AAAGE8Z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	She moved in, she is hot and cold, sex once a month I will marry her in a few months.....help me?	She moved in three months ago, i am 40 she is 36. She has two kids I have two kids. The house is always happy. She tells me she loves me. I love her to pieces. She has gained at least 18-25 pounds ever since we have met.We do church on Sunday, I cook almost every night, I massage almost every night. Friday nights are spa nights in the house. I was always sexually active. I wish we can have sex once a week. She finally confessed that she is not happy with her body and is depressed but I have told her over and over I love the way you look and since you love me and it will be your first marriage you should concentrate more on making your spouse to be happier. I thought the art of making love is to fall deeper into love with the person you love?? I want to help my fiance. She is a great person and as a husband to be I want to help her. Any suggestions ??
20081024223958AAO7hi9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Mature readers only please....?	Is she really very mentally ill? What is wrong with her?      Hello. I'm a leader in the community especially where church is concerned. There's a girl that I've known for some time. As a matter of fact, she attends a uni now. I've been told by numerous people that she has been clinically depressed among other things since childhood. I've noticed that she is always withdrawn. One day she told me that she feels very disrespected by people including me. She was crying. She left the church that day.   I haven't seen her or heard from her for months. She returned to church today. I pulled her to the side because I was trying to be nice and talk to her about what has been going on. We talked for awhile she is still very shy & withdrawn. During our conversation, she confessed to me that she thinks she's really "messed up" and that she thought about my wife & I having sex before. She said she also wished I could be her father that she is very confused and trying to work it out with a counselor. She cried for a long time and apologized repeatedly. How should I have handled the situation?
20081102134938AA0ieKl	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am sick of my friends coming round my house and just using it as a doss house, how do I subtly stop them.?	I have a crowd of friends that are unemployed for one reason or another and as I am a single parent find the need for company. Unfortunately these friends borrow money from me, eat my food and use my phone sometimes without asking me, eg I will pop round the shop and when I get back find them chatting on my phone, when I say anything they get moody and defensive with me. They say that they help me with my children etc but actually I help them more. The only reason I don't want to tell them all to sod off is because I know what it feels like to sit night after night in a house without any adult company. Therefore I wondered if anyone had any good tips for subtly letting people know that their taking the p****

20081103150938AAe9V1v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Stumped in a situation, help?	well i know this girls in class and we talk occasionally, she seems like the quite type. well we got to talk more at this party and i guess our personalities just clicked. Well at the end of the party i got her number and said i would call her. Here comes the problem, I'm Asian and my parents are complete dlcks about me not dating until I'm 18 but that hasn't stop me in the past though. The thing is i can't really get out of the house without them knowing where and when so things don't work out as it should which cripples my dating life. But my 18th birthday is in like 36 days. I would usually ask her out to diner and maybe a movie or something but not in this case.      So what i want to know is, what the best way to tell her that without sounding pathetic. Would she be will to wait, i mean i would still be able to talk to her at school and over the phone but im clueless from here. What should i say!      thanks for any advice in advance.
20081105150738AAChdNW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Have you ever experienced about cry and physical pain...?	Have you ever seen your father, brother, husband, uncle or grown man crying cause of PHYSICAL PAIN? If so, which was the reason (playing football...or other) and HOW OLD WAS HE when that happened?   Some months ago, my father, of 63 y.o., fell down from the steps and hit his back and broke his right arm.   He broke in tears and screamed like a little baby. That was the first time to see my father breaking in tears and crying like a baby. And that impressed me (I don't why).    In your opinion which is the age a man can suffer pain better? 20 / 30 /40 / 50 / 60 without crying?   And did it happen to you? If so, HOW OLD was the person injured? Describe the fact. Did he feel humiliated to be seen crying?   I don't mean permanent injuries...

20081116123929AARkd6G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys Plz help!!! A simple peck, is it considered cheating even though it was for a good reaso?	My boyfriend and I have been going out for 9months and it is so awsome. However last weekend i had to give one of my really good guy friends a kiss on the cheek. You see, his parents don't want him to have a gf because they don't think he  has good judgement skills when it comes to girls. Well he likes a girl and unless his parents give him the okay to date, then he can't date the girl. SO since i'm extremely well liked by his parents, i pretended to be his gf for the day and in order to make it work i had to kiss him. So i kissed him on the cheek and his parents totally bought it. Now hes allowed to date and the girl he liked is his new girlfriend, but now i feel guilty about kissing him, because i feel like i cheated on my bf. So the question is, was what i did considered cheating or should i just let it pass? and how would u guys react if this happened cause im going to tell my bf and i need an idea of how he will react. Plz help me!!

He's my mom's friend's son.. but he's not really my friend.. we don't usually talk. So once at a party that his mom hosted, my mom and I went... and he started talking to me casually. I felt a bit awkward, cause I don't have many guy friends and I don't know how the whole guy-girl friendship works, and plus, we never really talked before... we were like hi-bye friends or something. And so at the party, he, some other teens (all boys) and I went for a walk... and we were talking about sports... so he asked me what sports I like to play and I replied saying "Well, tennis is definitely my favourite!" and he was like "Hey, you should come here and we should play tennis together sometime!" and I was like "Yeah, that's cool!" .. and recently, he texted me asking if I wanted to play tennis in the weekend. It was weird, and I didn't know if he meant me and him or my family and his family... So is he asking me out? I haven't replied.. so what should I say? I really wanna know if he's asking me out or just being nice?

Then when i said i would never get married he said but  you would marry me wouldnt you .   He even jokes we need marriage counselling       He is so loving and affectionate and actually listens to what i say and remembers it word for word  .      But the other day were laying down talking and he said that i was to wet then he said he had thought of sleeping with other people i didnt react. He then apologised and said that it was good that i was wet and that hes glad ive stood by him .      Then he will sit on facebook commenting on girls pictures and thinking hes some kind of stud.      I dont react when he says things to me even tho it pees me off and upsets me       I just get confused by the i could spend my life with  you  and then the ive been thinking of boning other people.      He shows me his phone etc doesnt hide things from me    But his attitude annoys me

If your boyfriend tried to stop you from wearing what you want what would you tell him?
20090223022722AAMGFA4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do with a cheating boyfriend?	I had been dating this guy for nearly two years, when we broke up after the summer because I felt like he wasn't putting any effort into our relationship. We have since rekindled it, but the other day I found out some horrible news that he cheated on me. 9 months ago in June eh started hanging out with these "Dalton girl" (that was what they were called because of their school) and I began to feel slightly jealous and insecure, because he was spending a lot of time with them. I asked him about it a few times, but he assured me nothing was going on. Even after we broke up I thought there was something going on, so I asked him again but he denied everything, and like a moron I believed him. A few days ago I was on his computer and I saw a message to someone mentioning cheating. I asked him point out and he told me he had had a thing with a Dalton girl, but it was after we split up, being insistent that it was after. However, I thought it sounded fishy so I went onto his email because I know his password (I know, very sneaky thing to do), and found all these emails to her in the summer, from June until now, with them telling each other how much they loved each other and couldn't wait to see each other again. The ironic thing is that I went to visit him in Spain in the summer, when he was having something with her, and some of the emails date back to when I was right there.    Only once he found out I knew everything did he start admitting things, but he said they were over after summer because he loved me, yet there are emails from December and January this year where he tells her he loves her. Asking him, he says they were over but he was still flirting with her.    He says he feels horrible about it and he regrets it, but if you felt so bad, then why would he have kept it going for 3 months behind my back, and not telling me until I found out 9 months later?   When I said he had lost me he cried so much - something I have have never seen before and told me he would do anything to get me back, and he wasn't giving up that easily.      I know this might be obvious to some people, but my head is very messed up and I could do with an outsiders opinion. So someone please help me figure out what do do, or how to cope with this whole situation.

20090223021812AAlCubJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What about being with a cheater?	I wonder where the responsibility lies in being with a cheater. I am not in a relationship, but I regularly enjoy safe playtime with various partners. I recently met a fellow who is married, and typically I would say an automatic no to that. But I got to thinking...and as I was thinking more about it, I realize that anyone I've been with could be married, just not telling me.       So, in a case like that, where do you feel the responsibility lies? As two consenting adults, with minimal background knowledge of one another, what draws that 'line in the sand'?      Thanks for your valid opinions... I'm curious to hear what intelligent people have to say...

20090223021512AAGS9pq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend suddenly disinterested in sex but NOT porn...?	First of all, I'm a gay male, but I think that's irrelavant to the issue at hand and possibly some straight men and women or whoever wants to chime in have had the same problems with their significant others so hopefully someone out there can give me some good advice. If you're not wanting to hear any intimate details, then please don't bother reading this any further... I won't be using profanity, but I have to get slightly graphic to get my point across.      I love my boyfriend very much, he loves me also, we live together, have been a couple for over 5 years now and while I frequently get affection in the form of hugs and usually a daily "I love you," our sex life is dead. I've let him know countless times that I'm basically ready, willing and able to have sex whenever or wherever. I'm open to new things. I'm not uptight about it at all. I just like to have fun and not make a huge deal about this, you know? I haven't "let myself go" either since we've been together; meaning I haven't gained weight and I basically look about the same. The major problem I'm having is that he never seems interested in having sex, never initiates sex and has told me "once a month" is fine with him, which is a huge change from the first 3 or so years.      He flat out rejects my advances most of the time. Though he gives me quick pecks almost daily, he pulls away from me when I try to give him a more passionate kiss and while I used to be really spontaneous, I've pretty much stopped even trying because the constant rejection has become demeaning and has worn down my self esteem and made me feel unattractive, unwanted, etc. It seems like a chore anymore to even get a decent kiss out of him, and even when we do have sex he usually just lies there and I literally have to do all the work. To make matters even worse, he frequently watches and masturbates to porn. We have a laptop that he put a secret password on that I can only presume is full of porn. He refuses to let me use the laptop, by the way, even though it's technically mine as it was a Christmas present to me from my mother. When I do the laundry each week I'm always finding "stains" and I know they're sure as hell not coming from me or things we're doing together. It's really frustrating having someone suddenly claim they are borderline asexual out of almost nowhere, yet it's impossible for me to believe he's not interested in sex because of his porn-viewing habits, looking at celeb nude sites, commenting on attractive people and celebrities, etc. I have also seen a chat transcript with him telling someone he loves going to the gym for all the eye candy. What?!? I'm so bloody confused about all this.      I am trying to be as understanding as possible, but am at the verge of ending this relationship despite genuinely loving this person. I have heard every excuse in the book from him concerning his lack of interest in physical sex. At first I got the usual "I'm tired" excuse. That turned into things like "I don't like getting sweaty"/"I don't like getting sticky" (sorry about that but I had to say it!). That turned into "I don't like doing _____." The blank can consist of basically any sex act you could think of or even something as simple as French kissing (he said that having a tongue in his mouth is "gross"). Most of his body parts are also off limits or he claims he doesn't like them touched, too. It's basically impossible to really do much of anything because of all his stipulations and how picky he is about EVERYTHING. I just want him to loosen up and have fun and I have no clue how to accomplish this or if it's even possible at this point.      I know it's normal for sex to occur with less frequency over time but I refuse to settle for once a month, with me initiating it every time AND me doing all the work, while he's constantly turning to porn to fulfill his needs the rest of the month. He told me porn was just "easier." Yeah, maybe it is for him, but I have to sit here and just think "What about me?" Hell, I'm even open to watching porn with him but he seems to want to keep it secretive and private as if he's ashamed of it.      I can't believe my once healthy, fulfilling relationship has deteriorated this much over time. This is NOT the person I met. If he'd acted like this at the beginning, I never would have bothered. The thing is, this all started well over three years in and has gradually become worse despite my best efforts to keep the fire going. Suddenly he seems like he doesn't care whether I'm happy, nor does he seem to derive any pleasure from pleasing me. If I didn't love this person so much I would just walk away, but I've invested a lot of time and my feelings for this person are strong and genuine. I just don't know what to do at this point.

His girlfriends parents are really strict and he cant get much time with her alone. The reason being that her parents dont know about him. Also she needs a good enough reason to get out of the house. they havent been able to do anything alone and, can only meet when she can + when she has a friend (which is annoying for him)!    Do u have any excuses for her that may be good enough to help them get some time alone together?      Oh and by the way they both are 17 years old!

20090223020917AAcqGgh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Reason to be suspicious?	So, I checked my boyfriend cell phone last night. His ex-girlfriend had sent him three text messages over the past month, two wishing him a happy birthday and one wishing him a happy valentine's day. The birthday thing, ok I can see, but the valentine's day thing, to me was a little much. As far as I know, they haven't talked in over 6 months, so getting this message out of the blue struck me odd. Another thing that I noticed were large gaps in his incoming call history. For example, the amount of time between calls may be 3 to 4 days, when I know that I have called him during that time or have been with him when others have called during the time period. I checked his outgoing calls, and all of those seem to be in sequence. Also, he usually calls me before he heads to bed which is usually no later than 12-1am. But, the past few nights he's been calling me as late as 4am to say goodnight which is weird because in almost a year of dating, i've never known him to stay up that late. When I first tried to look at his phone he jumped up quickly and came over to where I was at and took the phone back to his desk. I played it off, but got the phone as soon as he went to walk the dog, and that is when I saw all of this. He's been acting less attentive lately and has been starting little arguments more than usual. I'm probably just being paranoid, maybe borderline weird, but something about this doesn't set well with me. I would just like some opinions to see if I'm anyone else finds this odd. Thanks so much!!

I turned to this young boy I was mentoring walking down with me, when I looked back down and saw him looking at me.

20090223021652AAfa4yt	Family & Relationships;Family	Adult daughter lives at home and is into perverted lifestyle?	Please I only want commited Christians to give me advise on what they would do put in my place. My 22 year old daughter is into a lot of perversion. She is presently living at home to get back on her feet due to getting into debt. She has also expressed her desire to go to college.  She has put her lustful desires on Craig's List, and gets with people for bondage, or bisexual activities. She is doing things we are very against, and we know she is not respecting God's Word either. She has her girlfriends over to sleep over, and we recently heard them having sex. I am afraid of kicking her out due to her being in extreme debt or possibly living with one of these girls who she is having lesbian contact with. She has been raised in  Christian home with Christian values, and for the past few years she has been going on a serious decline with God. We have asked her to go to church with us, but she says she wants to decide this on her own. Should we demand she go to church if she lives in our home. Or would God want us to force this on her. I just don't want someone even if it's my own daughter to be practicing such a sinful life in my home. I want to honor God, so if you have any advice which is founded on the Bible I would appreciate it. We are so concerned about something serious happening to her through all this. Please help.. thank you so much...

20090223023902AAliO5y	Family & Relationships;Family	How can you be so sure it is YOURS?	This is a sensitive question.      When your gf becomes pregnant, how can you be so sure it is yours? What if you have sex frequently, then there is no way for you to tell when you make her conceived. If that is the case, how can you be so sure it is yours.      I know what I say may sound selfish and sensitive, but due to my unpleasant experiences, I can no longer be too sure of anything.
20090223023938AAEB5X0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He doesn't believe in marriage..?	Me and my boyfriend have been living with each other for almost 2 years. I'm in this point that I'm looking forward to his proposal, but when we talked about it, he said he doesn't believe in weddings and stuffs. He even said, "what we have right now is marriage, what we didn't have is a wedding".       I know he has a point, because living with each other seems like we're already married, but still, it hurts because I think he's not yet sure if he wants to be with me for the rest of his like. I feel like he doesn't want to close the doors yet, so it won't be hard to walk out the door if the doors are still opened.       I don't know whether to leave him, or to stay in this relationship and accept that I'll never be walking down that aisle anymore.
20090223024029AAyubV0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She sent me a sms that to her i am just a classmate just it...?	i asked her to give me her phone number and she did.after two days i sent a sms related to the class subject politely and friendly and she answered and asked me another question which seemed to be unessential. after few days i sent a sms and told her how much i love her and in that sms i asked her not to respond to it and she didn't.today she sent me a non sense sms asking me about the lesson taught in the privies session .that was a sign of her approaching and responding successfully to me ,so i asked her to come to the class a little bit earlier the coming session in order to become closer to her.she sent a sms and asked me why should i come earlier. i said i have something to tell you .but she sent a sms if you are going to discuss about that love sms i have to inform you that i really respect you as a nice man but just as a classmate not anymore.   what does this sentence mean ,is it a normal feedback or reaction ?   does she really like me as a classmate and not anymore?   does it make her change her mind if i ask her marry me?   should i insist on having closer relationship with her?

20090223024209AAiB0Gw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We kissed and then nothing! Best answer 10 points?	My friend of a couple of months and I went out on Saturday in a group of friends and I decided to stay at his house because it was closer and I didn't want to get a cab etc. Anyway, he's always been overly friendly (touchy etc) but we were lying in bed and we were very close and he kissed me.      We never made out but we kissed a couple of times. Anyway, today things are exactly the same as before we kissed! We're just still acting like friends. I don't know if it's because I have a boy (we're on a break and non-exclusive but he doesn't know that) or if it was just a mistake (we were both drunk etc.)      What do you think?? I don't want to ask him outright!
