20090304091910AAn0fb7	News & Events;Other - News & Events	WOW...An arrest warrant for a sitting President while in office!...Is this a dangerous precedent or justice?	ICC Issues Arrest Warrant for Sudan's President al-Bashir         The Enough Project issued the following statement in response:      "The International Criminal Court arrest warrant for President Omar al-Bashir provides an unprecedented opening, making Sudan's prospects for peace riper than they have been in memory," said John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project. "How the Obama administration handles this immediate foreign policy challenge will have a major impact on the outcome. It is crucial for the new President's team to clarify to Arab states, China and others that the U.S. policy objective is a just and durable peace for Sudan."      John Norris, The Enough Project's Executive Director, added, "This message should be heard loudly and clearly around the globe: If you kill, maim, and rape your own citizens, there will be a cost for your actions. I hope other tyrants and warlords around the globe are taking note. Slobodan Milosevic, Charles Taylor, and now, President Bashir were only willing to learn the hard way. There are now millions of activists around the United States that expect the Obama Administration to make both peace and justice a priority in Sudan."      The issuance of an arrest warrant for Sudan's sitting head of state for crimes against humanity offers the Obama administration a chance to catalyze multilateral efforts to bring about a solution to Sudan's decades-long cycle of warfare. One of the crucial missing ingredients to conflict resolution efforts has been some form of accountability for the horrific crimes against humanity that have been perpetrated by the warring parties in Sudan, primarily the Khartoum regime.      President Obama should now take a number of key steps, including:          * Working with the U.N. Security Council to support targeted sanctions against those most responsible for violence in Sudan and imposing a comprehensive arms embargo against the Government of Sudan;       * Making UNAMID effective with a robust force on the ground in Darfur with a competent lead nation and a clear command-and-control structure;      * Working closely with interested parties with leverage in Sudan and the region, especially China, the United Kingdom, France, and key African countries, to coordinate efforts on peace efforts, the protection of civilians, and accountability;       * Countering continued violations by Sudan on the UN ban on offensive military flights in Darfur; and       * Appointing a senior Special Envoy to not only address the situation in Darfur, but Sudan's multiple conflicts and their regional dimensions.

20090304095230AAXVEOJ	News & Events;Current Events	Would you like to fly like the 'Jetsons' with your own strap-on aircraft ?	London, March 4 (ANI): A New Zealand inventor has created a "Jetsons" like strap-on aircraft, a personal flying machine that people can wear and soar through the sky. According to a report in the Herald Sun, the 'Martin Jetpack', as it has been named, was made by Glenn Martin, who spent 27 years designing and testing his invention.    Orders have already started rolling in for the personal flying machine that soars through the sky for up to half an hour with the help of two powerful fan jets.At least two wealthy Australian businessmen are among those who have put their hands up for one of the first 158,503 dollars jetpacks, due off the floor at the Christchurch factory at the end of this year. "At this stage, it's mostly boys into toys who are putting deposits in," said Martin. "I guess it's a pricey toy, but it's quite a lot cheaper than a Ferrari," he added.    Commercial interest has also been building, with Martin confirming that he has taken calls from military agencies and other border control and rescue organisations interested in investigating how it could benefit them. The first personal jetpack was built by the US military in the 1950s, but the Bell Rocket Belt stayed airborne for 26 seconds before crashing.    Martin's invention has two rotors powered by a 200-horsepower piston engine. "You strap it on, rev the nuts out of it and it lifts you up off the ground," he said. His version is more fuel efficient, costing just 15 US cents for 20 seconds in the air. It can keep a person airborne for up to 30 minutes. (ANI)     http://in.news.yahoo.com/139/20090304/98...

Baxter Sent Bird Flu Virus to European Labs by Error (Update2)     http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=n...       Isn't this information valuable for people when considering their risks when deciding whether or not to take vaccinations?  It would certainly make me lean toward Vitamin D as an alternative to flu vaccine.  How about you?      Some quotes from the article:      " Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Baxter International Inc. in Austria unintentionally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in three neighboring countries, raising concern about the potential spread of the deadly disease.      The contamination was discovered when ferrets at a laboratory in the Czech Republic died after being inoculated with vaccine made from the samples early this month. The material came from Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter, which reported the incident to the Austrian Ministry of Health, Sigrid Rosenberger, a ministry spokeswoman, said today in a telephone interview.      “This was infected with a bird flu virus,” Rosenberger said. “There were some people from the company who handled it.”      The material was intended for use in laboratories, and none of the lab workers have fallen ill. The incident is drawing scrutiny over the safety of research using the H5N1 bird flu strain that’s killed more than three-fifths of the people known to have caught the bug worldwide. Some scientists say the 1977 Russian flu, the most recent global outbreak, began when a virus escaped from a laboratory. "

20090304105458AAAO54g	News & Events;Current Events	Every day in the UK seventeen babies die at birth...?	There are now, understandably, calls for the Government to stump up more cash to find out why this figure hasn't improved in the last ten years and develop ways of changing things.  The sum of ￡3,000.000 is being suggested by Sands.      Do you think it would be reasonable to stop funding IVF treatments for a few years and divert that cash to helping existing pregnancies produce live, healthy babies?      I'm not intending to be disrespectful towards people in need of IVF - I almost needed if myself before my second child was conceived.

What if George Bush had launched similar coordinated attacks on David Gregory of NBC after their disagreement last year?  How would the press have responded?  Bush didn't then.  But now Obama is doing it now with Rush Limbaugh.        It's not a good thing when arrogant, corrupt politicians try to use their power to silence voices of dissent, instead of fighting them in a true battle of ideas!

20090304100301AAx6Iyg	News & Events;Current Events	Do you think reality television brings out the worst / magnifies the worst in some people?	"The camera doesn't make you a better person, it doesn't even change the person that you are, it just magnifies who you are," said Harrison. "If you're a tool, you come off like a gigantic tool. ... This guy [is] probably your garden-variety tool. But you put him on 'Wife Swap' in front of America and he looks like the biggest *** in the history of mankind."    Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, who was made out to be the villain on the first season of NBC's "The Apprentice," said she understood what Fowler must be going through. "I can completely relate to his experience," she said. "I feel bad for him, because a lot of people get into that situation and receive a lot of criticism and don't know how to respond to it."    Omarosa -- famous enough to be recognized by her first name -- said Fowler's situation has a lot to do with the nature of reality television. "When America looks at reality TV, they want entertainment," she said. "Once you enter the world of reality, and the cameras go off, unfortunately, America's expectation of you doesn't stop -- their expectation is for you to continue to entertain them."     http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/0...
