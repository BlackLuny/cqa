20090203062550AAz1cNP	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car stopped moving yesterday. What could this be?	I'm pretty sure it was the transmission, since I've had my transmission worked on TWICE now, and yet it goes again, which makes me wonder what the heck is really going on. Anyways, I was driving and then suddenly it made like three jerking/stutter noises, and it became harder and harder for my car to move as I tried to accelerate, before it finally came to a complete stop.      All else appeared normal with the car, no check engine light, or fluids missing, or overheating or smoke or anything.       I got it to the autobody shop and so far all the said was "we noticed you were really leaking antifreeze bad." That was odd to me because I  wasn't leaking antifreeze before my car was towed, so ...that was just very odd.      Other than that, I just couldn't get my car to go. It started fine, the engine sounded fine when I accelerated, all seemed okay,but the car refused to move at whatever gear I switched too. It wouldn't connect, but I still had no problems witching.      I also had my transmission worked on a month ago, and before that last year. I don't know why I'm having these chronic problems.         From the lttle that I typed, what could possibly be wrong with my car?

20090220082448AALWxiY	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Airbags in 2002 S10 never deployed in a side/head on collision with a semi.?	My dad and a friend of he were involved in a collision with a semi truck, it hit the front left and side of his truck.  His friend suffered a broken left arm, broken pelvis and urethra, he was already sent to rehab 2 days after the accident. My dad, however, suffered A LOT worse, he alive thank god, however, his injuries are all over his body, none really life threatening.  He has some severe head trauma, which we do not know if he will make a full recovery, no swelling in his brain but there is some bleeding but no hemorraging.  He will be transferred to a acute head trauma rehab center soon, since the ICU really can not do much more for him other than get his infections under control and breathing.  He is on a respiratior and feeding tube and countless IV pain meds, antibiotics, and sedation.  He and his friend did have on their seatbealts at the time of the accident and some of their injuries are consistant with that, but the air bags NEVER deployed to prevent their heads from hitting the steering wheel or dashboard.  The collision was not a high speed collision, at least the semi was not going more than probably 45 mph or so...the accident was my dads fault but I question if the airbags would have deployed would he have the head injury that he has now.  He is at fault for the accident itself and quite possibly for the injuries to a certain point, but he could have been protected from the head injury had they deployed.  Any thoughts??

20090220083942AAZEzd6	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Volkswagen	Is the mechanic tryin to rip off?	Ok so heres the story my parents have a 99 pontiac grand am and have put in about $1500 in repairs trying to fix a radiator leak ... they replaced a water jacket, new hoses, thermostat, and finally the water pump... Now the same mechanic has been workin on the car and says he fixed the problem every time and still the same thing happend ... well they finally said it was the water pump and the engine had to be taken apart to get to it (ive never heard of this) but anyways... they also suggested to change the timing chain since the car had 186,000 miles on it... so my parents agreed ... the car was in the shop for three days and when they finally got it back (a friday) the car sat all weekend and on monday it ran fine all day until later that evening I took my little bro shopping and the car started to make a weird noise ... It only makes it when the accelerator is pushed .... sounds kinda like race car but not in a good way (like a loud rapping noise) My dad thought it was the timing chain (which he is a good mechanic on basic stuff but not that) so he took it back to the garage and they told him it was a broken piston rod... Now I believe this garage has been ripping them off and I kept telling them that ... seven times for a radiator leak? cmon ... it just seemed they werent trying to fix the problem and possibly breaking something else. Could they be right about the car or is there other possibilites?

20090220092927AA6IkgC	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Audi	'89 200 Quattro overflowing pressure valve before it even heats up?	I have an '89 Audi 200 Quattro that is building up too much pressure in the coolant right after startup.      So much to the point that it is blowing out the relief valve on the radiator cap pretty much right when you start to accellerate moderately. So much that I have to add coolant every 60 miles or so.      I have not noticed anything resembling water in the oil, nor oil in the coolant. No white or blue smoke at all.         I should mention:      Replaced the water pump, the pump we replaced it with had narrower teeth than the rest of the gears on the timing belt.      I replaced the radiator cap, still has same problem.      There is no thermostat installed, which I found out 5 minutes ago while attempting to see if the thermostat is seized.       It is running straight water in the cooling system now, because I am not made of money.       The turbo was modified by a previous owner.      Does not seem to have lost any power, but runs rough sometimes.         Any ideas?

20090220085859AAjO5Eu	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Can I get a better deal on car insurance by being creative with my job title?	I'm a lifeguard. I work at a council run leisure centre. My post - as stated in my contract is "Customer Services Assistant (Wetside)"      This is what they call Lifeguards, because we can't spend longer than an hour watching the poolside at any given time and so the rest of the time is spent doing other jobs that the council could train monkeys to do (They probably would do too, if it wasn't for the RSPCA.) But by calling us "CSA: Wetside" the bosses can get us to do the other monkey jobs like putting out the bouncy castles, supervising children's parties and cleaning toilets.      Aaaaanyway - What could I call myself on the insurance forms to make myself cheaper to insure? Obviously, not a doctor or anything.      But I could call myself a "cleaner" "customer assistant" or "lifeguard" - Which would save the most money?      And is there a website out there where I could find out?      My job involves -      Lifeguarding (40% of the time)   Cleaning (30% of the time)   Supervising kids parties (10% of the time)   Putting out sports equipment and then putting it away again (10%)   Filling the vending machine (5% of the time)   Talking to customers about our facilities and giving them a tour of the premises (5%)

20090203082558AAhrIl8	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Renault	Can anybody explain as to why my central locking on my Renault Megane 54 plate suddenly stopped working?	i locked it the following night as normal came to it the next day and it wouldn't open!! So opened it manually the alarm going "CRAZY!!" put the card into the reader pressed start and it stopped the alarm so i started the car as normal turned it off tried to lock and unlock but nothing!!! It just wont lock or unlock!!      I know you can do it all manually by leaving the door open and pressing the central locking button on the car holding it in for 5 seconds and it locks the car but with no alarm or immobiliser!! Plus you have to unlock it on the passengers door manually every time and open the drivers door from the inside just a pain really and was hopping someone could give me some sort of an explanation as to why this has suddenly happened liturally over night!!      Many Thanks
20090203082909AAHxLMV	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Oxygen sensor question?	I have a 96 blazer. The intake gasket blown a week ago. I think it had been leaking for a while because of the antifreeze i was losing. The engine light came on twice in the weeks leading up to the actual blown intake gasket. I got an error code for the oxygen sensor by the cat. converter. I was wondering if this could have caused the o2 sensor to fail. If the intake gasket was leaking before can it make the o2 sensor fail and why?
