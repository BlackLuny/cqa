20090304164156AAJTud5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What if you killed a person in self defense?	I am a Christian, and even though the Bible says not to kill, it also says that your body is the temple of the Lord, and you shouldn't let harm come unto it. If someone tried to hurt or kill you, they would be harming the temple of the Lord, so would it be a sin to kill someone out of self defense?

20090304170523AAREI3E	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Hahahahahahahahaha Kent Hovind?	Meet Kent, he is a creationist. And he believes that the world was covered in water because of the flood. In the flood, a 200x200x200, -300 degree celsius ice meteor struck the world,falling from infinite , after breaking into pieces first. Due to the magnetic fields, most of the pieces hit the top and bottom of the Planet, creating cold giant cold spots, now known as the north and south poles, freezing the mammoths standing up.      Hmm, now lets disprove that. to escape the earth's gravitational well, you need to be traveling at 10km/sec. This of course is 300x the speed of sound. This is also the velocity that an object falling from infinite to the earth's surface will gain. Now a object needing to escape from the Sun's gravitational well needs to be traveling at 30km/sec, or 900x the speed of sound, that's New York to Los Angelos in 2 minutes . The meteor would need to escape from the sun's gravitational well to get to Earth. Now it turns out, a -300 degree celsius object traveling at 900x the speed of light would gain 10000 degrees celsius of heat. Now, something traveling at 900x the speed of sound, at the temperature of 9970 degrees celsius hitting the earth would certainly not make "cold spots" and it wouldn't freeze the mammoths where they stand, it would incinerate them. Now to calculate the amount of energy one ton of water would release hitting the earth at 900x the speed of sound, you need a base, in a recent experiment, a 1/3 ton object struck a meteor at 300x the speed of sound, releasing the equivalent amount of  energy as 4.5 tons of TNT, now something weighing 1 ton moving at 900x the speed of sound would release the equivalent amount of energy as 200,000 pounds of TNT.      Kent, you just got P0WNED.            Please comment on what you think of the mathematical ownage.

20090304201804AARokVa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians where is the word strive and try in this scripture?	Matthew 5:48   Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.      Since 99.9 percent of the church says strive or try. I want you to point out the words strive or try in the scripture above.       Proverbs 35:5-6   5   Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.   6   Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.   Deuteronomy 4:2-3   2   Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.   3   Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.   So keep adding and subtracting from the word of God and you won't have to worry about non-believers going to hell by themselves.    Matthew 7:22-23   22   Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?   23   And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.   This is the very reason my children will not be raised or taught around church folks who are taught within the four walls.
20090304194211AAyArsR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do you think God feels about all he sees at 6075 years after Adam, how much better is mankind?	God could have wiped out all on earth at any time, but he    has not done so.   In all this time in the bible, there has been a few good men.   Just think about how many decent people there were when   the flood came to wipe out earth wide violence, year 1656.   Abraham is not surrounded by anything God could look   down upon and be proud of at 427 years after year 1656.   When Moses dies 470 years later, there have been a few   good men, but not the majority as Joshua establishes a   way for law enforcers to get a start as Judges, and 480   years later 1Ki.6:1, Solomon is third king and has 36 more   years, there will be 18 kings, and 14 generations more to   Matt.1:1-17, in the New Testament at 1st coming of Jesus.   So how different is it at 2009 years after bible years ended?

This is kind of hard to explain but in a nutshell: I have a muslim friend who recently came to my school from Egypt. Her first day of wearing her hijab was filled with teasing and extremely rude comments. The very next day I noticed that she was not wearing her hijab and when I asked her why she simply told me that she didn't have the heart to wear one anymore. So me and another friend did a lot of research on the Islamic culture (it's quite beautiful). We decided to wear hijabs to school so that our friend could start feeling more comfortable wearing hers...and it worked. The only problem now is that I find that I love wearing it and my dad says that it's weird and tells me that there are better ways of getting attention....(note: I'm not looking for attention). I just want to be myself and I feel like myself when I wear one...maybe I'm just confused. help please!!!!

Then she started getting snobby and bossy, telling girls younger than her (like me) what to do all the time.      Everyone here is equal, there is no boss, expect for the Team Leader who is currently away.  Then she started getting really nasty and snappy.  She threw a massive fit because the printer wasn't working one day and screamed and walked out of the room.  She just walks around like she is too good and is above everyone, plus she always has this SOUR look on her face.  She never says hello to anyone when she starts, I just find her really rude, negative and offensive.      I've already reported it to the Team Leader who is away but what else can I do for myself that can help me deal with her, besides talking to her.  Thanks guys.

20090304222000AALjAfM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about these verses from the Quran that talk about specific Atheists?	46:11   And those who disbelieve say of those who believe, "If it had [truly] been good, they would not have preceded us to it." And when they are not guided by it, they will say, "This is an ancient falsehood."      2:13   And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.      6:111   And even if We had sent down to them the angels [with the message] and the dead spoke to them [of it] and We gathered together every [created] thing in front of them, they would not believe unless Allah should will.      I was astonished at how many questions these verses answered about Atheists, non-believers, etc.      What do you think about these verses? I find them unbelievably accurate from looking at the comments in this section saying religion is just ancient falsehood and how all believers are foolish and ignorant, and follow 'fairy tales'...

20090304222537AAtOJzS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why do people seem to always want to identify themselves by one thing?	I see people posting on yahoo answers all day. How many of you actually have names? Few, I must say. It seems like everyone picks a name and avatar that shows them off and labels them as one, big ol' thing. For instance, some of the most common: "Homo Dave" or "Bi and Proud" with a rainbow avatar. A name like "Awesome Atheist" or "There Is No God" with some anti-religious avatar. Or, the opposite: "God's Witness" or "PreacherMan" with a cross as the avatar.    (On a separate note entirely, I can understand why religious people would identify themselves, because they're supposed to convert people. But why atheists? Why throw it in people's faces when that's what you hate so much about Christians. :3)      Anyway, why do people want to identify themselves by one thing only? Are we really so shallow that we adopt one label and revolve out whole lives around it? What do you people who don't do this think?      BTW, I'm gay and agnostic. So no one whine that I'm being prejudiced.

If the god knows who amongst us would kill, torture, rape... yet he also knows that person will enter heaven, because of his repentance,    Why allow him to kill in the first place ?

20090304224405AAoQRsJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If the universe really is millions of years old, then why do galaxies wind themselves up too fast?	The stars of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, rotate about the galactic center with different speeds, the inner ones rotating faster than the outer ones. The observed rotation speeds are so fast that if our galaxy were more than a few hundred million years old, it would be a featureless disc of stars instead of its present spiral shape.1 Yet our galaxy is supposed to be at least 10 billion years old. Evolutionists call this "the winding-up dilemma," which they have known about for fifty years. They have devised many theories to try to explain it, each one failing after a brief period of popularity. The same "winding-up" dilemma also applies to other galaxies. For the last few decades the favored attempt to resolve the puzzle has been a complex theory called "density waves."1 The theory has conceptual problems, has to be arbitrarily and very finely tuned, and has been called into serious question by the Hubble Space Telescope's discovery of very detailed spiral structure in the central hub of the "Whirlpool" galaxy, M51.2

I'm actually his boss. We got paid yesterday via direct deposit and I noticed he seemed very angry. He told me that over 90% of his total pay was taken from him for child support and back taxes. He's got two kids from two different women and he now also owes IRS over $50,000 in back taxes and penalties. The back child support bill he has is already over $15,000 in just 9 months of not making child support payments to his two kids. I told him that those two pieces of pus*sy really cost him a lot of money. hahaha! His tax problem is a result of him not filing his tax return in over 5 years. He doesn't know how he's going to pay the rent now or just to survive. The mothers of his children are now with other men, which pis*ses him off a lot because he feels as though he's got to pay them now for kids he never wanted in the first place and also without them giving him any more pus*sy. hahaha!!! How much longer will my co-worker keep getting his wages garnished? I feel sorry for him because he got himself in this very terrible situation. Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks!

20090304223951AA1nApa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does love feel the same in Heaven?	I mean on earth, we love our boyfriends/ girlfriends.  We also love our parents and siblings and friends, all in a different way.      On earth, we are bound by flesh, and genetics, and of course we have babies, so we have to have a different "love" for a spouse or family member...but in Heaven, we are no longer bound by flesh...      So once we're in Heaven, for example do we still "love" our spouse the same way?        Im sure we're happy to see them, but do we still love that person like he/ she is our "spouse"?       Not stronger or weaker love, but will it feel different?

Ok posted this earlier, and got some feedback.This is what initially happen:   Ok..here is the situation. Me and a very close male friend was in his truck together . Right before I was about to leave his truck, I decided to give him a hand squeeze, just as a way of saying thank you for dropping me off. He squeezed my hand back.I thought, what the heck, I squeezed his hand back. He squeezed back.Again. Finally, I figured ok, I'll just leave now. After all, it was kind of a awkward moment. But I wanted more. I grabbed his hand again and we both squeezed each other hands at least three more times. I am gay obviously, but from the sound of this, does anyone else suspect that my friend is as well?      I have often told him that several times that I'm crazy about him, that I'm addicted to him(Addicted meaning I love to talk to him).He has never pushed me away. You know, like stop talking to me or anything. Yet, he keeps going talking to this one girl. I still don't know.Think it might all be an act?

20090304231910AA6cK0V	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Bisexuals:  A thought provoking question for you (kinda long, but I hope you'll appreciate it)...?	I went to a discussion tonight led by our campus GLBT organization.  The topic was "The reality of bisexuality".  We had about 5 different people, both male and female, who identified as bisexual on a panel for a Q&A type thing.      One of the questions was "What does the identity bisexual mean to you?"      I listened to a lot of the people say they are attracted more to personality and what's in someone's heart rather than restricting themselves to a binary world of just one type of person, or one type of gender, or one type of sexual orientation.  That they could go back and forth between both men and women and gender didn't matter.      I challenged them on this, and asked my own question.        I said, 'If gender doesn't matter and you state that there is a lot of crossover between bisexuals and transgender people, due to the fluidity of gender both seem to understand, then why is it that I find a lot of bisexuals won't date a transgender person?  What I see instead is a lack of preference for SEX, but there's still VERY much a preference for gender.  Meaning, most bisexuals I'VE met want a penis that acts like a man, and a vagina that acts like a woman.  I rarely find a bisexual that wants gender and sex to mismatch in a partner."        So, I"m asking the bisexuals HERE...IF gender and sex don't matter to you and you find equal attraction to both, is it simply about the biological sex of the person, or is it deeper than that?  And...would you go so far as to date or become partners with a transgender/transsexual person?

I was watching some videos on youtube tonight in spanish and I came across some americans filming themselves speaking in spanish. While some had really good spanish accents, I noticed that most of them really butchered the accent.What is worse is it seemed like they were doing that on purpose because they were more embarrassed  speaking in spanish more than anything...Why do Americans have such a hard time mastering the accent of another language??Why do they butcher it?I don't mean to be stereotypical either, I learned spanish as a 2nd language and I feel my accent is really good, but as a fellow american I can't help but feel somewhat embarrassed by these videos.They make it seem as if all americans have a hard time adapting to other ppl's cultures and they give the americans who actually TRY to learn other languages and adapt the authentic accent a bad name.      Has anyone else noticed this before??Why are americans so embarrassed to speak another language in public and why when they do try to learn another language why don't they at least try for a good accent?

First I would like to ask if any satanists consider the joy of satan a satanic group anyhow. They have a deluded concept of Satan, the concept of Satan & the history of Satan throughout history. The Joy of Satan would have us believe Jews are reptillians, Satan and Demons are ET's that live on some far off planet and then turn around and claim that religions such as christianity are bullshit. I for one am a devoted independant Satanist, but the JoS looks more like a scientology spoof with a neo-nazi esque to it than a legit Satanic organization.
20090304231022AAoCs4x	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Maybe quran doesn't say how to pray because there isn't meant to be a specific way to pray?	Within sunnism itself there are different ways to pray (eg. Malikis sometimes do it with straight arms and look at the horizon rather the ground). Non-muslim monotheists pray their own way and their prayers aren't rejected. Maybe the hadith-follower argument "quran can't be used on its own becaues it doesn't say how to pray" doesn't make sense if there was never meant to be a rigid way to pray in the first place: quran includes basic statements of how to pray by mentioning a basic wudu, prostration and to face towards Makkah so maybe these are all that's required. It's not so much how you do it but that you do it.      Just a thought. What say you?

I was talking to some friends of mine and the guy I like was In front of us (we were waiting for our bus) and we got onto the subect about gays, lesbians and bisexuals. Anyways two of my close friends are bisexual and they were in the conversation and my friend who is one grew below us is like saying gays and bisexuals and lesbians are wierd and stuff. And I was getting pis sed at her, I'm straight but I c nothing wrong with gays/lesbians/bisexuals they are just people it doesn't mater wot they do in the bedroom if u get wot I mean by that (it might not make scene but that's how I see it) anyway the guy I like turned around to talk to me he didn't no wot the convo was about but as soon as he heard that my friend was homophobic(well at least it seems that she is) he got mad I could tell by his face. She upset me in some many ways taking jabs at my really close friends,my crush/friendand all the inncocent gay,lesbian and bisexual people. How do I tell her this or explain to get that there is nothing wrong with them?

20090304230200AAK2ofP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Wicca: How many of you actually practice magic?	As I understand it the primary focus of Wicca is to be in tune with nature and the planet as a living thing as the source of life and your spiritual peace, rather than any specific gods. I really like the nature aspect of it and have something similar in my own life and faith. Please let me know if I got something wrong there.      But also there are what I think society considers stereotypical Wiccans who practice magic spells and rituals. I had a friend in high school who was Wiccan and let me see her spell book. I thought it was interesting but I wasn't sure of the real purpose of it.      How many people are Wiccan and actually practice the magic part of it? What is the primary purpose? Is it more for meditation and centering the spirit or is there an expected outcome? Do you feel the magic works when you invoke it?      I'm not trying to bash. I'm trying to learn. Thank you for your answers.

I asked this question earlier, but am not really getting any responses (as usual) so I thought I would try to rephrase it.  I was talking to a friend about a friend of hers who recently came out.  I asked my friend if she had any idea before.  In response she said something along the lines of her friend having more outwardly characteristics of being gay (please, no lectures about stereotyping, she has been nothing but supportive to her friend) then she herself has.  Or that's at least what her comment came down to.  My friend has a boyfriend, but I found it interesting that she would compare herself.  Do you think that could mean anything?  I was just kind of curious to know if that may have been her way of saying she was herself not completely hetero.  Or am I reading way too much into it?  Anyway, thanks and sorry for reposting this.

Isso porque, segundo ele, os chefes gays conseguem maximizar a performance dos seus funcionários já que têm a capacidade de olhar cada indivíduo de forma única e perceber a melhor maneira de aproveitar as suas habilidades naquela fun??o. Kirk acredita que isso se deve a maneira com que os gays "sobreviveram" na sua adolescência e se adaptaram a uma "sociedade que n?o foi feita para eles". "Com isso ele se torna uma pessoa mais intuitiva, comunicativa e com uma grande capacidade de solucionar problemas", acredita Kirk.

20090304232231AA4ItYz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What constitutes proof of God?	I have a couple stories, you can pick one as your minimal level of proof that God exists.  They're all true.      1. Last week on Sunday, my friend's mom died.  She was sick for a while.  Well, a week later, he came to church, as was his custom, and he sat next to me, which only happens once every few months.  I knew of his loss, and I felt that I should pray for him.  Usually I don't feel like praying at all, but I did it, and there were emotions there.  I asked that the music would touch him in his grief, that the words would dig deep and give him comfort.  Fast forward to today.  We attend a smaller group on Wed. nights, and he decided to tell the group how much the music on Sunday gave him comfort that lasted through the week.  I didn't ask him to say it, and he almost quoted my prayer, even though I didn't say it aloud.      2. My mom, three years ago, was in an ICU, and the nurse told us that we need to make funeral arrangements because people don't come out of the state she was in.  The doctor wasn't quite as grave as that, but he said there was a good chance she wouldn't make it.  Well, I was feeling pretty down, and I didn't really believe much in prayer, but I was starting to.  I at least had enough faith to ask my wife to pray for her.  She did.  My mom got well and left the hospital in the next two days.  She told us later that she heard my wife praying in her ear, but she saw her brother and mother, who had both died years before, waiting there for her.  She said she knew what was happening and decided that she didn't want to die.  I asked her, and she said that they were as real anything, not a dream.      3. JP Moreland tells a story, and it goes like this:   "I wrote a prayer request in my prayer notebook — a prayer which was known only to me. I began to pray specifically that God would provide for the two of us a white house that had a white picket fence, a grassy front yard, a close proximity to the campus (specifically, within two or three miles), and a monthly payment that was no more than $130." --- Long story short, he gets exactly what he wrote in his journal.  Google it.      4. Jesus cast out demons.  Mt. 9:24 But the Pharisees said, "He can cast out demons because he is empowered by the prince of demons."       If you saw someone acting crazy, we'd all say, "He has something wrong in his brain... a screw loose up there..."  If, pop, something snapped back into place, would you attribute that to human physiology?  Or would that be evidence that God healed them?      5. Peter made the lame man walk in the name of Jesus.      6. Acts 19:13      7. Jesus died in a public execution.  He rose from the dead and showed himself to hundreds of witnesses who died for their confession of this proposition.  There were people who saw the thing happen and didn't believe.      --      I have seen many people say that God has not shown himself.  It's true that He doesn't always make it obvious, especially if you're playing with fire (messing around, drugs, things you know to be wrong, etc.), but there are indications from time to time.  How much proof would you need to assent to the truth that God exists?  How much to bow your knee?  How much to match everything in your life to that standard?

I'm a very racially mixed city boy...I move to the south for job reasons.  I go to work, come home, go out to meet ppl but most of the ppl just aren't my 'type' just due to difference in interests.  Tried befriending some guys at work but most of them just kind of look at me funny and tell lame corny cowboy jokes or ask me to go to a 'rodeo' with them...(no way in hell am I going to a rodeo). Sorry thats not 'my cup of tea' I guess I should say.  Are there nice places in TX (specifically in the Houston area) that have decent acting ppl and good women?  Are there specific places that ppl from other places that live here hang out?  I tried going to some of the little local areas...and no.  Being very racially mixed I don't feel comfortable being around a clan of whites, blacks or Latinos.  Its like you have to pick a side out here and I just can't do that.  All of them are talking about each other and constantly making racist remarks about the other.  Can I get any positive feedback?

20090304230847AAUttJz	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Its ok to do this right?	OK little moral dilemma here:      I have a biology project. We have 3 days to work on it in class. We MUST work with partners so ok im stuck with someone random. We do about 95% of the project in class and save it to his flash drive. Of the six Pages on it I did 4. And on the pages my partner did i had to edit/revise/review/add so i end up doing more than half of the work.      By now im buzzed out with all the work. On the 3 other days before the project is due we have to work on it at our houses. Now heres the catch.  I give him the flashdrive with the project on it. Said OK here it is you do the final works cited page and ill finish it off with the last page then print it since it has to be in color or you cannot read anything. The next day he comes back and i asked did you do it correctly MLA format nice and neat? He says no but he finished it. I told him i dont care your only doing one thing you might as well do it right . He takes it for one day. Doesnt show up for 2 days.      2 Days later when the projects due he isn't there. Now here's the biggest problem. #1 the project isn't finished.#2 We NEED to print it out in color on another printer or its ineligible. So i tell my teacher "Well he;s absent and he has it" so i do the ENTIRE project that night the entire thing works cited page and all and turn it in. Then he shows up that day. I asked him where he was he said and i quote   "I was in the hospital My mom died"   I ask did she really?   "No"   So he;s making jokes right now   me- So why werent you here we needed to finish it   Him- Oh i just didnt feel like going to school   me- So you couldnt stay two @^%! Periods and given it to me and left and went to the nurse.       Now let me tell you something this project will make up my entire grade at this point and he basicly ****** it up. He said he finished the other one on the flash drive but he neglected to remeber that we needed a color printer (which they do not have at my school)  and that we needed an extra page. I didnt put his name on the one i wrote so he;s getting  a zero on his.      That ok right?      Sorry if im not clear enough

This may be strange but my friend told me she had gone on a job interview the man that was interviewing her was in his 50's. She is only 25. She thinks he was aroused by her during the interview she said it seemed he was more interested in her chest rather then in her experience and background in relations to the position she had applied for. She said that she was looking at him when he would talk to her and his wondering eyes would end up staring at her chest. She is a 36 E "yes implants" could that be the issue before they were done talking she said he had nothing else to say but that he wouldn't stand up and try to find several of lame things to talk about and when they were departing she said he pointed her to the door and did not walk her out and the man stayed in the conference room she noticed he stared at her butt when she was leaving she saw him through a mirror.  Is it possible that my friend might be taking this a wrong way and is being a little paranoid or could it be true? My other question is do men at that age can still get it hard? Could such thing's turn them on at that age? I mean could a woman at an interview possibly get him aroused?

A friend was going through the pictures and found resent pictures off my gf's myspace and in her defense said 'Anytime I save pictures onto my computer they go into I-Tunes'      They were like crazy close before they started dating. Unbelievably close friends and it was obvious they were completely in love with each other and as just a by-stander at the time I was happy for them when they started dating. Then they broke-up and after while we started seeing each other, never really discussing the whole thing. My gf still talks about her a fair bit but is pretty much all negative and still keeps a lot of the letters and notes and things they shared.       Apparently they had a really bad fight when they broke up and have been angry at each other ever since and always just find excuse to fight and really around them it just feels like tension, possibly sexual or just unresolved issues.

20090304234805AAscKhi	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is there a double standard when it comes to discrimination?	Insurance companies are "allowed" to make males insurance rates higher because statistically males cause more accidents (they are also allowed to do this with age). I suppose I don't really see a problem with this, as long as it's solely going by statistics.      However, if a store added a 5% additional tax on all merchandise sold to blacks because blacks statistically cause the most crime (which includes theft, so they're trying to recover their loses from the ones causing it, "statistically"), that wouldn't be allowed. Again, it would simply be going off of statistics. If the trend later changed to where blacks didn't cause the most crime, than the tax would be applied to those who did. (Yes, there are statistics for this type of information. Please use Google to search for this information prior to leaving a answer telling me that crime statistics can't be generalized to one race, because there are plenty of statistics, just like there are for males and accidents.)      I fail to see why one is allowed and one is not. I know people will throw the, "you can't generalize all blacks in to one category" card. Fair enough, and I don't. But insurance companies seem to generalize all males in to one category, but that seems to be "okay."      The insurance companies are just going by statistics to make sure the ones who cost them the most money are the ones who are paying the most money for their service. Why couldn't the store do the same thing for their products?      I'm not a racist. I'm all for equal rights. But I'd just like a reason why this type of situation is allowed. I don't need any Captain Obviouses to come telling me one has to do with sex and one has to do with race or any similar weak argument like that. I'm well aware of that non-sense and would like to hear educated answers, not ridiculous common sense bologne. Thanks :)

A friend of mine ran into a couple recently.  The female of the couple had a fetish/fantasy of watching someone eat her flesh.  Her husband happens to be a surgeon.  Well, during a scar revision, he kept part of the fat and tissue, and then invited my friend to partake of this "snack" with them.       My friend actually DID it.  So now I can say that I have a friend that's ate human flesh. I know, a little creepy.  But...I mean think of the experience??  How many people on this planet can say they've done something like that?  Not too many.  Plus there was no murder, or harm to anyone involved.      So, if you were in the same type of scenario..where it was safe, sane, and consentual, and you had the opportunity to eat human flesh, would you?

Tonight, while I was on campus, I paid to park in the student center garage.  While I was in the student center, I realized that I had left my wallet behind at the bar where my friend and I caught happy hour prior.  So I couldn't pay the fee to get out of the garage.  I went to the attendant and explained the situation, and she was like "So where did you lose your wallet?"  And I said, "If I KNEW where it WAS it wouldn't be LOST now would it?" Then she was like "Well..you don't have to be so rude about it!"  Ugh...seriously? Doesn't a stupid question warrant a smarta** answer?      Then after that, I went to the bar where said wallet was lost, and asked the bartender if anyone had turned in a wallet in the last 3 hours, that me and my friend were just here and I think I left MY wallet behind.   He said no, and then asked "Is it a men's wallet?"  (keep in mind, I'm a guy)  Umm....hello?? O_O       I mean I try not to let it get to me, but seriously, why do people ask such stupid questions sometimes??

20090305005524AAStXYg	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: Any simplistic thinker who still does not understand the HOLY TRINITY?	IDEAL HUMAN BEHAVIOURS DEMONSTRATED BY JESUS DOES NOT IMPLY THAT HE WAS A (REAL) HUMAN BEING.      Spiritually, Jesus is divine but physically, he was a human being, and that is the rationality and aim of his humanized birth. See Rom. 8:3-6; Heb. 2:16-18. Also, says Allah according to Qur'an 6:9, "Had We appointed an ANGEL our messenger, We ASSUREDLY had made him LIKE A MAN SO THAT HE MIGHT SPEAK TO (associate with) MEN...."      Muslims often cite John 5:30-31; Mark 13:32-33 and John 1428 etc as disproofs of Christ's divinity. But, logically, these verses, rather than disprove Jesus' divinity, expressed the anticipated and expected demonstrations of the character that was Jesus-in-exemplary-typical-human-nature and , therefore , in accordance with God's programme as stated in the Qur'an 6:9 and:-      (1) Phil. 2:6, "Who (Jesus) being in very nature God, did NOT consider equality with God something to grasp, 7 But made himself NOTHING, taking the very nature of a SERVANT, being made in human likeness 8, and found in appearance as a MAN, he HUMBLED himself and became OBEDIENT to the death, even death in the cross"      (2) Heb. 2:16, "For surely it is NOT ANGELS that he (Jesus) helps, but Abraham's descendants. 17 FOR THIS REASON HE (GOD) HAD TO MAKE HIM (JESUS) LIKE HIS BROTHERS IN EVERY WAY in order that......" (Compare Qur'an 6:9)      (3) Rom. 8:3, "(Jesus)....in the LIKENESS OF A SINFUL MAN.........."   So, in the light of these verses, it should be clear that Jesus' humanized acts did not mean that he was actually a human being (John 8:23) but were the divinely designs that were to make Jesus not unnecessarily scare the humans but, rather be their SOURCE OF INSPIRATIONS.      In other words, if Jesus were to act God-the-father again even when haven purposely transformed into a man, the transformation would logically be nonsense.      And, that is why when Jesus accomplished his mission on the Earth naturally, he went back to where he came from, Qur'an 4:158, "God has raised him up unto HIMSELF". See also John 6:28, 62, and Mk. 16:19. John 8:23.   Yes! Jesus is, according to both the Bible and the Qur'an, back to his origin, God.       The TRINITY   The term 'Trinity' is not of Biblical origin but the concept is. Thus, as any Biblically foreign word, it is not necessary to employ it in particular in whatever situation. You can replace it with any alternative term or you don't term it at all but just believe the concept if you understand. If you don't understand it is not obligatory to believe in it as Christ did not emphasize it nor made believing in it a condition for going to heaven. However, the word 'Trinity' is relevantly expressive, thus it was employed as a term by some Bible interpreters just because it was the best word that simply expressed the ONENESS of the Almighty God, His soul in a born human body, and His soul when , or as, not inside a body. Thus:      1. God-the-FATHER, means the ALMIGHTY God.   (Deut.32:6; Mt.5:48,6:9-14; 1Cor.8:4-6)      2.God-the-SON, means the SOUL-of-the-Almighty-God inside His (GOD'S) WORD, which was physically born as a human body. (Col. 1:15, 19; John 1:1, 14-18, 17:5; Phil. 2:5-7; Mt. 1:18; Isa. 9:6; John 14:10; Pls. 82:6)      3. God-the-HOLY-SPIRIT, means just SOUL-of-the-Almighty-God, i.e. when, or as, not inside any bodily form. (John 4:24; MK. 3:28-29; Job 33:4; Gen. 1:2; Pls. 139:7-12; Hab 3:3; 2Cor. 3:17-18).

I know it's 1am and I should be studying for midterms but I just HAD to ask you guys (BTW I am new to this forum. I am top contributor in Higher Edu/ Univ. but I am SO sick of the "Can I make it into these schools with my stats?" questions.)      Aanywayz, so I am a straight female who is a strong LGBT ally and I have some great friends I met online from different countries (I practice my foreign languages online with people from all over the place).      So my openly gay male friend from Venezuela and I were talking. My school recently opened a minor in LGBT studies and it's supposed to be a huge deal because I think there is only one other program in the state like it. I told him about it and sent him a link, thinking it was way cool of my university to do it.      He was like "Why LGBT studies? What makes a professor qualified to teach a gay studies class? Is he gayer than me? And Psychology of Gay/Lesbian Identities class is like studying you because you are different." Then he was like "It's like Vegetarian Studies. Why don't we study them?" Then he made up "Bi-sexual Vegetarian Studies" and so on.      And about LGBT clubs he was like "It's cool they are proud, but I wanna be seen as Rick, not gay Rick."      I was kind of taken aback. Like, I thought he would think it was cool but he totally surprised me.      What do you think?

20090305021626AAcolxP	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are REAL criminals let off lightly whereas ordinary people are prosecuted harshly?	Only yesterday I was watching 'Police Interceptors" and it showed them chasing a 'millennium style' burglar (he'd broken into a house to steal the car keys) and was driving at 90mph through a residential area in the stolen BMW M3. They eventually cornered him in a cul-de-sac and as a female officer went to the car he tried to run her over. He was arrested.   At the end of the program, this announcement was made..."The driver of the stolen BMW could not be linked to the burglary, so he was released without charge."   WHY???....    1) he was driving a stolen car!   2) he was driving at 90mph in a residential area   3) he tried to run an officer down.      Any ordinary driver would have had the book thrown at them for that.      There was also that lady who smacked a teenage vandal (who was desecrating a war memorial) across the head with....wait for it...some paper. The police were called....the vandal was released....and the lady was arrested for assault.   What HAS happened to the justice system in the UK?

Ive been building a fort or a "house" if you can call it in the forest close to a city. The materials Ive been using are logs Ive picked up from the ground, plus sticks and boulders but the land is officially owned by the park.  I used no nails or adhesives in the construction because I have only stacked the logs and rocks together to create the exterior.  So far I have constructed a wall using a system of sticks (about 4 feet high) and now it's only missing a door and a roof.  Is the idea of building a house from forest resources and then living in it feasible or just plain crazy?

20090305003303AAu8JkQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question for Christians?	I go to a school where people have very low moral standards and couldn't care less about God. I'm doing the best I can to not fall under their influence, but sometimes it just happens! Like yesterday... we were having a Psychology class and the teacher made us criticize each other to see how it would all turn out... you know, kind of a role game. I should've said something but I didn't. I just did what I was told instead of standing up and saying that it's far from good to criticize others. Next week each one of us will have to give their examples of constructive criticism... and I don't want to do that! It's just wrong, isn't it? So what can I do? Any suggestions?   I would be more than glad to behave like a true Christian should, it's just... I'm afraid people will say I'm a hypocrite because my behavior wasn't that splendid in the past... and if I suddenly start talking about God and how things should be...people won't believe me, you know what I mean? For example, if I say, criticizing is wrong, nobody will believe me because I criticized in the past.

20090305013806AA5RmXP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where do Christians get their morals from?	if God did exist , as many of you disrespectful theists say , how and why would you say that what Hitler did was wrong? Where do our human intellectual minds get moral reasons from? How can we distinguish bad from good? if there is a god, how can we have a mind that is able to create , think, and many other things. if God did exist one person could kill another person and there wouldn't be nothing bad about it. but because God would forgive them afterward  . Without god you have to use reason and applied philosophy to arrive at a workable moral code . Morals are survival values and things that make you a bad neighbor aren't survival values . Killing and eating your neighbors will get you food but your neighbors in order to survive would be morally right to kill you if necessary to stop your immorality .    http://www.nobeliefs.com/nazis.htm       No God , know Peace .

I have recently become very interested in wanting to go to Church and learn about God. I think I might look into the local churches and start going. It's like a 'pull' that is making me want to go there. If God wants me to go to church, I'm just wondering why now though? I'm nearly 25 years old, why didn't this 'pull' start earlier on, like when I was a teen or something? I have done things I regret like getting a tattoo, doing some naughty things etc and God could have stopped me from doing all this by making me want to go to church years ago?

20090305003556AAscpVP	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why is it that if you on't agree with someone else you are deemed "ignorant"?	I don't mean to sound conceited but I am a very well-educated and well-informed individual. Through taking AP and honors courses in school I've learned a lot of science I don't care too much about and I actually study history for leisure by myself. I like to study genetics and the human body, anthropology, geography, medieval history, and I epecially like to study the connections between the great ancient empires ("the meeting points" i.e. Central Asia, the Huns, the Mughals). If you gave me a blank world map I could probably fill in 95% of the world's 200+ countries.       Yet I am called "ignorant" for saying I'm scared to go into Compton by myself. Why must we live in a day and age where we cannot express our opinions without shutting the other person out? That's being close-minded.

20090305000451AApZFP6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I feel like i'm at my end?	I am 21 -- I'm hurting on the inside  very badly and no one knows.  I feel lost, alone, abandoned, and hurt.    I've never had a girlfriend and ironically enough -- its the one thing I've always wanted -- I'm a pre-law student and honestly dont care about the money of a lawyer compared to finding that someone.  I've prayed over and over for God to send me that right person and for years i've been without a response -- or at least without a "yes" response.  my faith has been shaken because my emotional state of being is extremely critical and unstable now.  i can't find a reason to get up in the morning -- much less to continue living.  I feel very much alone and cry myself to sleep often.  I can't find an answer to go on putting effort out for school, my job, or my life in general.  I've failed many many times when i try to reach out and try finding a girlfriend -- i've gotten every possible no response imaginable -- from "i'm focusing on school",  to "i can't", to "actually, i have a boyfriend", to "sorry, i dont wanna risk the friendship."  -- I just feel like everytime i take a chance i end up shattering my self-esteem even more, and the tape i'm using to put the shards of my heart back together just melts away every time i  encounter rejection.  I dont' know what to do anymore......
20090305000912AAXxiaE	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is My Cousin a Lesbian?	I went on a trip to NJ last weekend with my cousin and one of her girlfriends, I'm only 13, my cousin and her friend are in their 20s already. to save money we stayed in one hotel room with two beds. My cousin said she wanted to sleep in the same bed with her friend, so I could have my own bed.      But at night, I was woken up by a noise, I didn't get up or move. I saw my cousin and her friend were both under the sheets, their entire bodies were covered and I couldn't even see their faces. But it seems like they were directly on top of each other. I could only see their hands hanging out at the top of the bed, they were holding both hands with their fingers crossed, so I knew they were face to face. They stayed that way for a long time, and it seems like they were pushing each other or having some sort of test of strength, I got a lil scared because I thought they were fighting. They stayed like that for at least an hour or so, they didn't let go of each other's hands at all, it was kinda like hand to hand wrestling or domination of some sort.      Is my cousin a lesbian? I can't be sure since I didn't see anything clearly.....or were they just wrestling?

I never liked a girl until i was like 16 and i got my first girlfriend at 17 and we recently broke up, i'm 19 now.       And well the question is ..I don't know, well I don't like to identify myself as "lesbian" i don't even like the sound of it, and i'm not completly sure that I am 100% gay cause sometimes i do fantasize about boys but I don't see myself in a relationship with one, most boys are unfaithful and assholes and well the point is i think i like girls more than i like boys but maybe i kinda still like boys and the thing is that i wanna have a traditional family and all that stuff, you know?    if i try to do that with a girl it's really complex and i dunno..   If two girls could have a baby (i mean nothing artificial) then everything would be perfect and i would know what to do.      what do you think about this?

In fact, I think that is one of the main failures of society, we are moving towards publicity over privacy when we should be moving the other way.      For instance, recent news such as the mother who wanted to conceive 8 children and the bachelor show controversies.      Even with me, some people always push themselves into my business even after I politely tell them to get out.       So in your opinion should people have the right to be involved in private matters or no?      My dream is to live in a society where privacy rules and people's freedom should be restricted, since unfortunately there are too many idiots in the world today.

20090305014724AA9bIje	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Being Held down bad nightmare needing interpretation?	I have the feeling of a nightmare, as if someone or something is holding me down. I cant move, I do speak sometimes, but I don't get words in return just actions, i guess, the actions either increase as if I'm being held down tighter or with more physical strength, or the grip is lightened, I have this feeling that it is a demon or evil spirit, but no harm is done to me and when I awake I am not scared, often times in my dreams, I will call out Jesus name, or rebuke satan, sometimes this will end the dream other times, it makes it worse; weirdest part is that, I fall asleep, but in the dream exactly where I am is what I'm looking at, kinda like if you fall asleep and in your dream you hear a car horn, and you dream of someone honking at you and telling you to come outside, or of running water and you wet the bed, mine is like that except it is precisely what I see, so when I awake from the dream it feels or seems as if I've done nothing, like I wasn't even dreaming at all, it's hard to define, but I always remember the dream as well... any thoughts??

Sometimes I feel that when I only get 1 hour of sleep in a night I am more tired and function worse than if I don't sleep at all.      However, when I am too tired, I forget everything! But, the exam is 6 hours away so it's not like I would be too tired. If I did this for my last class of the day I'd surely do very poorly.      What do you think? A little sleep or no sleep?
20090305025342AAGjc70	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How God want you to monitor your own behavior?	Life review  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_review       Since all our actions can be conceived as being good or evil, yet there is no set rules philosophically that state what is defined as good or evil, some argue that good and evil does not exist; so we cannot prove for certain if we are good or evil.      However, all of our actions are the result of mental processes that occur, these processes are what we want out of them actions, the purpose of these actions; and thus the thoughts are important more than the acts them selves.      The thoughts themselves are a result of our intentions, our intention to be good or evil; thus if we could read our intentions, we could prove whether a person was really good or evil at heart.      Since we cannot know without reading each others minds, then what can be done in the afterlife is a 'life review' which does show us our intentions and not our actions.   We judge our selves, because we are our best judges, but in a way that judges our own intentions rather than actions.   Also we only know our intensions the most.      It is in those intentions, that we are shown how they have affected others emotionally and morally. So then we have a real understanding of who we are in terms of our moral nature.      Try this out as an experiment...      Think of your whole life; do not think so much about what you have done good or bad, but think of the intensions behind them actions.   The sum total of these intensions and the way that they have affected others to the best of your knowledge is the best judge of who you are. But do not forget your moral nature does change in time.      Now tell me, what do you think of yourself?   Does this change your outlook on how you should behave?      CREED

The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.        16 "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. 17 Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."

For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."      Could these verses mean it is a good thing for Christians to mix with sinners ?

Hi there, first ill just explain a little about me:   I'm 19 and live alone with my mum and brother and sister. In October I came out to all my friends and my sister that I'm gay, and they all took it as a shock but all accept me now. In December, me and my sister had a party at our house and I invited my boyfriend to come and be there for it, at the party someone told my brother that I'm gay, but he seems fine about it. A couple of days later I travelled up with my boyfriend to his mums house and we spent Xmas there. After that I moved in with him in Manchester and we've been together until now. I felt really guilty living my life without my mum knowing whats happening, and didnt want to tell her over the phone, so I told my sister to explain to her in the nicest way she could, as I was planning to go down and visit with my boyfriend in a months time and didnt want any arguements when we visit. Aparently my mum is angry, and doesnt like the fact that my brother found out. The thing is my brother is 14, and said he figured it out before anyone told him months ago. She is 45, and has no idea, is she stupid? I mean she has a masters degree and cant figure out that her own son is gay after I visited the gay capital of the UK about 6 times in 2 months? when I had my boyfriend down to visit? when in the 19 years that she knew me, she never wondered I have never had a girlfriend, even though I'm quite attractive? I have no idea whats going on in her head, or how she is going to react when I talk to her.          I just wanted to share this with someone :/ any feedback?

20090305034937AAbkFua	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	The saddest Gay love story ever :(?	The Adventures of Music the Ranger 1   Sequel to last plot I revealed      In the prelude game you can only play as Music and the others where just supporting roles.   In this game there are six playable characters: Music the Ranger, Kyle, Richard, Chris Brown, G-102 Gamma, and Steve. Music is the only charcter selectable at first the other must be unlocked through the course of the gameplay.      Although all the charcter's stories overlap into the main plot, each character has an individualized storyline.      PLOT:   After Doctor Gayman is defeated by Music the Ranger and his Death Gay Star (Star Wars joke) is desltroyed, he quickly discovers another way to attempt to every person on Earth gay. He goes back to Alcatraz Island when Richard is again sleeping on the job and shatters the Master Emerald again releasing the monster named Gayness. Richard wakes up and has a brief encounter with Gayness before Alcatraz Island again falls out of the sky. Richard embarks on a mission to gather all of the broken pieces of the Master Emerald (the premis of Richard's story).      Music the Ranger finally makes it back to his hometown if San Jose, California but upon arrival he witnesses a huge police chase so he follows to see what's up. The police try and shoot Gayness 0 (Gayness is numbered 0-7 depending on the number of Sex Emeralds he's consumed) Music defeats the creature but he's perplexed as to what it is.      Kyle crashes his airplane of the Santa Cruz coast and Music goes to rescue him. Kyle then reveals that he's using a Sex Emerald to power his plane. When Kyle and Music head to Kyle's workshop they confront Dr. Gayman and battle the Gay Hornet. Afterwrads he snatches Kyle's Emerald and feeds it to Gayness making him more powerful. With all seven Emeralds, Gayness will become invincible and Gayman plans to use him to gayify the world.      Music and Kyle go off to find Sex Emeralds while Richard finds more Master Emerald shards. Gayman steals another Emerald from Music and Kyle. Richard see Gayman carrying a Sex Emerald an mistakes it for a piece of the Master Emerald. Ricahrd the battles Gayness 2. After the fight, Gayman convinces Richard that Music is after the Master Emerald pieces.      Richard sees Music and Kyle with a Sex Emerald and again mistakes it for a piece of the Master Emerald. The fight and Gayman steal another Emerald. The all battle Gayness 4. After, Gayman reveals he new spaceship, the Gay Carrier. Music and Kyle hop in their plane the Tornado and chase the Gay Carrier but they get shot down.      Kyle reminisces about his friendship with Music. He then goes off to find another Emerald for the Tornado 2. Froggy swallows the Emerald but Kyle catches up. Froggy is Steve's pet.      Chris Brown reminisces about all the times Music has saved him. He considers Music his hero and have an infatuation for him by this point. The Gay Carrier flies over his head and drops a little bird he names Lily. But G-100 Zero is after the bird and chases Chris Brown in order to get Lily back. Chris swears he'll protect Lily and help her find her family (this is what Chris' story is about) On his way he sees his hero Music and points out that "Cute couples can get in free" to the local amusement park due to a promotional offer. Chris makes Music chase him through the theme park but he ends up getting chased by Zero instead when Music loses track of Chris. Zero then kidnaps Chris Brown and takes him and Lily the birdie onto the Gay Carrier. Music climbs mountains to chase after the Gay Carrier. At the mountain's peak, Kyle arrives in the Tornado 2 and they land on the Gay Carrier. Richard also arrives here as he discovers that the last pieces of the Master Emerald are aboard the ship.      This is the gay human-robot love affair part. G-102 Gamma is one of Dr. Gayman's G-100 Series gaybots. Gayman sends Gamma to get the bird from an imprisoned Chris Brown. Chris refuses to hand over Lily and begs Gamma to set him free. When Lily looks Gamma in the eye, it causes to Gamma to let them go. Chris Brown is shocked to see this gaybot has a heart and offers Gamma his friendship.      When Music and Kyle find Chris being harassed by Dr. Gayman over the bird because the bird has a Sex Emerald, Gayman summons Gamma to battle Music. Just when Music is about to finish off Gamma, Chris Brown stops him. He explains that he won't let Music hurt Gamma he says how that gaybot is different than the others for setting him free and urges Music not to hurt him and Music agrees. Chris then goes to Gamma's side in tears begging him to wake up. Gamma wakes up and is shocked to discover that it is Chris Brown who saved him life. Chris extends an even deeper offer of friendship if Gamma leaves the dark side. When they leave Gamma's hard drive has an overlaod of emotions but Chris Brown's kindness towrads him causes him to malfunction and turn on Dr. Gayman and he sets out to destroy his brothers from the G-100 Series.

Alright, so you're in a G-dless place, so you do not have a bible or any sort of religous items, all that you have is your mind, your body, and the clothes on your back.      What is a simple method for warding off demons? Not demons that possess people, but rather physical demons.       I had this issue in a dream the other night, I tried two signs which I were told were used to ward the evil eye, but they did not work. The sign of the cross did nothing either.   I also have weak faith that I cannot depend on, so perhaps that is why some of that did not work.      I would be interested in any sort of spiritual methods, any folklore, or just things you've heard hear and there.      Thanks!

20090305025849AAHR8bD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Yesterday I posted a question regarding the Bible, Christianity and slavery.  I was somewhat shocked in that?	some of the responders seemed to be saying that slavery is and was okay as long as the slave accepts his plight and the master is fair and just.  I just cannot see it that way.  In slavery - one person owns another person.  No one is ever going to own me without a fight.  No soothing words from Paul are ever going to convince me not to disobey my master.  I'm guessing that if these responders imagine themselves living in this era that they think of themselves as fair and just masters.  Try imagining yourself as a slave and see how you feel.  Why would they say this?  To defend The Bible at any cost?  Many of the responses were extremely well written and obviously came from people with a very high education.  But you use the English language as a tool to obfuscate the truth.  To say that slavery was a reality and therefore there had to be fair and just laws governing it is like saying that torture is a reality so in order to be just we need to be sure that the family members of the victims never have to see their mangled bodies.  Several of the responders championed the notion of obedience.  I agree that obedience is proper and necessary but only to an honorable principle.  Slavery does not qualify as an honorable principle.  Some of the responders painted a rather benign picture of slavery during the Roman Empire.  In about 75 B.C. a slave named Spartacus led a revolt against the Romans.  The revolt ulitmately failed but had some brief initial successes.  After reading several accounts of this conflict it is very clear that Spartacus did not choose to be a slave.  It is also very clear that he did not find life as a slave to be enjoyable.  Was Spartacus wrong to disobey his master?  Would Paul have chastened him and counselled him to abandon his foolish rebellion?  After all - even if he had to spend his whole life as a slave - and even if his children had to spend their whole lives as slaves - maybe - just maybe - one day - his great, great, great grandchildren would be allowed to be free.
20090305030124AANyvel	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Is she really a ghost?	a few days ago, my bestfriend gave me this portrait of a girl with straight black long hair with straight big bangs, pale skin, dark brown eyes and a little grin on her face. she said i looked a bit like the girl on the frame. and it was a gift.   ever since i got the portrait, i've been seeing this girl every time i am in class(but she was a bit transparent). i have ignored her since. last night i saw her open the door and straight into my room and she opened the window. so i thought she was just imagination so i shrugged my head and she sort of disappeared. but the door and window was open.   i got scared so i went into out living room and turned on the tv. a few minutes later, my best friend called my phone and told me that the girl in the picture was haunting her a bit cuz she saw her everytime she passes by the store where she bought the portrait.   this morning, when both of us were on our way to our school, we passed by the shop where she bought the portrait. it had a "GONE OUT OF BUSINESS" sign by the glass window..   do you think it was just our imagination?   do you think it was a coincidence?   or is the portrait really haunted?   this is not fake...   i've had enough...

20090305031416AA3wcpT	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Jump into the deep end or let things mature?	Well recently i've been sensing some mutual feelings from some guy at school, but we're both pretty shy (i'm actually pretty extroverted, but I become speechless when i'm around this guy)       So it's the start of the year and this is the last year of college, should I jump in the deep end or should I try to get to know this person over time? Which option reaps the best results?      It's so strange, last year I always noticed this guy staring at me, we had no classes together back then. But now we have 3 together and he sometimes glances at me, but I feel he is trying to distance himself from me because he doesn't want to go assuming.   I have a feeling that's what i'm doing though.       I believe people are straight till proved otherwise, I kinda lost hope for a while, but in a group discussion a few days ago we were discussing how liberal our state was and he brought up the topic of gay marriage being pushed (in a neutral manner) but I was kinda surprised he even mentioned it.      He seems like a pretty talkative guy in class, but the few times we talked he seemed kinda nervous and avoided much eye contact.      So anyway, what do you think about my situation?   (I usually answer questions myself, but i felt that I had to vent my experiences to someone)
20090305031631AAPsXxP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Canceling bar mitzvah celebration as punishment for wetting the bed?	My son will be 13 in a few months and he still wets the bed almost every night. According to halacha, he'll still become an adult whether there is a ceremony in shul or not. But he certainly isn't a "man" if he still wears diapers to bed. I'm sure you can imagine how I feel having to buy him "goodnites" at the supermarket. I fill up the cart with other things, then go to the diaper aisle, look around to make sure no one can see, then I put the goodnites in the cart under other things. Is taking away his bar mitzvah an acceptable punishment? Of couse, he can have the party as soon as he starts waking up dry.

20070402183539AAMfqpB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To believe a Psychic or not...that is the question...?	I recently had a psychic reading over the phone, and she was eerily correct on certain things.  One thing she told me was that I was going to be having a baby this year.  She was very adamant about it.  Some of the things she said have been correct, others weren't for whatever reason, so I'm not sure whether I should put alot of stock in what she says.       If you were me, would you actively try having a baby by what the psychic told you, or continue safe sex, and see if it happens?  Would you be torn if you'd decided to NOT have any more kids, than was told this?  My husband had decided to get the surgery needed to not have any more kids, but now I'm doubting whether he should.        What are you thoughts??  Thanks in advance, just looking for other points of view :)

Ogni giorno se ne hanno notizie, oggi una madre che prostituisce la figlia 14nne a schifosi vecchiacci, e le due undicenni abusate da una persona tanto per bene cui le affidavano le madri separate, e la bambina 13 suicidatasi a causa di abusi. Guardate che il vostro silenzio  facilita questo. Si vuole introdurre l'argomento nelle scuole ma i genitori si oppongono. Se non prendete posizione siete complici. Ho i comunicati del CNR e della FAO. Per il CNR: una ragazza su 4 ha subito almeno una volta nella vita molestie sessuali. Per la FAO: nel mondo un bambino su 5 è abusato da un adulto. Invece di preoccuparvi della  morale dei tempi, degli omosessuali e della Chiesa vogliamo aprire gli occhi su questa terribile verità? Perchè il 95% degli abusi avviene in famiglia. La vogliamo vedere questa cosa o facciamo finta di niente perchè se no questo mondo non vi piace più? Io ho a che fare con una fila di bimbi abusati, volete farvi sentire? Perchè nè la legge nè le mamme li tutelano.
