b1u9jlRhaa	hustla <br>  <br>  Commonly used by rappers to describe a drug dealer, but it's also a street term used for pimps or anyone who makes money illegally on the streets, it can also just mean your getting a lot of money doin what you do best.<br>  <br>  I didn't get the second word
HN5dIrlYaa	wear a dress<br>  that you feel comfortable in<br>  andd make<br>  sure that you can move in<br>  it while your dancing lmao|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	It sounds too conservative.  Clubs are generally kind of skanky.  I'm not saying look like a ho, but dress comfortably, and sexy, but don't look trashy...the makeup is what's really going to sell anyway, since you can have the sexiest outfit out there, if your makeup looks trashy, you will just look cheap...|`|TwHqhG0iaa	well that description kinda sounds to casual but i'd have to see it to be sure. im sure its fine though.|`|vNOxGgasaa	it would be alright<br>  sounds a little casual but make sure you have your hair down<br>  to make it look better:]<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|xLXVSrn6aa	Sounds too business woman-ish for clubbing|`|jtVVuG6Zaa	yes. i think it really depends on your age.
jlXPsVfdaa	Definitely keep the blonde hair.  I am partial to blondes I must admit, but I find it looks good on you.  Better than a darker color for sure.
PhPwAGVNaa	Totally up to you, but be aware, that it might take a little money to be a model at first.|`|AA10792562	Sure|`|PaP3tQiMaa	Yeah, i'm a high fashion model, just don't grow too much, (Good job if you are done growing!) You are the perfect height. Email SHOK models, or Ford or Elmer Olsen. DON'T join endeavor. They have taken my paycheck... and so, I never got payed. Make sure you know, until you are established, it can cost thousands of dollars, without being payed for, but if you are good for the job, they will train and pay you well. Good Luck! <br>  Bry.|`|j4SQd17oaa	Just because you're tall and blonde doesn't mean you can be a model.<br>  There are lots of factors, like your measurements and size, face, and your beauty in general.<br>  If you think you've got what it takes, you can try to find your way in the modeling world, but it's not easy to get in.|`|726edd84935de8b35a78643bac84badaaa	yeah sure, if you have the right figure that is.|`|y8HRHAcIaa	Just give it a shot, go for it!!! If they don't take you, well is their loss.|`|Dyo6iKRfaa	Well, just because you're tall and blonde doesn't mean you'll be a great model. <br>  You have too look good, be photogenic. And depending on what modeling you want to do it really, really helps to be a certain size. For example: most runway models have a 34" bust, 24" waist, and 34" hips. Though commercial modeling isn't as strict.<br>  You should check out, www.newmodels.com. <br>  It has a lot of helpful resources. Good luck! :)

lh3WIZ1saa	gay|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Do what you want to do and phuck the people who tell you it looks dumb.  I have  afriend who has a star of david on his pelvis, and it looks fine.  He's happy and that's what matters.  Don't worry about male female looks and crap.  It doesn't matter as long as you're happy with it.  Don't get  a tattoo to please people....get it for yourself...|`|Yfgf47lBaa	it might look ok, but it might not attract the females and only attract the males...<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|3xz9lgB4aa	better than on a fat male lol jk<br>  dont worry about how it looks to other people. put it wherever YOU want it at|`|fVca0uK2aa	queer in both senses of the word|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Honestly some tattoos on certain places of the body are very male/female oriented. As a woman's body accentuates the hips, I think tattoos there are very feminine. Also on the lower back, as women wear belly shirts, it would be kinda tacky for a guy to have a lower back one. That's just my opinion though.|`|0RTQXy2Naa	who cares what anyone else things.. you should get tattooed for YOU and not ask strangers on the internet what they think about your tattoo.. <br>  <br>  seriously, if you really want it, get it.
PhPwAGVNaa	OMG SO CUTE.<br>  <br>  White/black cardigan FTW!<br>  <br>  Wear black tights underneath with silver flats!<br>  <br>  Again .... SO CUTE. Great choice!|`|10k8AapCaa	what an awesome dress! wear black or white tights underneath, and wear one of those mini jumpers...like those jumpers that cover the length of your arms, but only come up to about the top of your stomach. the jumper, also, will look better if it's in black or white and the same color as your tights.<br>  hope this was helpful!|`|hrtLeyfCaa	wear some leggings and one of those jacket-type things that cover your shoulders and only go down to the bottom of your chest. <br>  <br>  i'll look for a picture and add it on when i find it (:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c324/alana1986/I%20Love%20Your%20Style/crop3.jpg?t=1236409306" rel="nofollow">http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c324/a...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  like that, but something cute. cause i think that's ugly, haha.|`|UhSbRMPhaa	OK well this will depend on what your personal style is... <br>  <br>  But for length, maybe layer it over a slightly longer black dress or slip (one that is long enough).<br>  <br>  Then for your shoulders, wear a black cardigan (perhaps a longish one from American Apparel).<br>  <br>  Add some chunky black jewelry, or a black high waist belt (around the two dresses, not over the cardigan)... and go for a boho, layered look. <br>  <br>  For shoes, it depends on your dress code, and what type of shoes you like. I'm thinking a black patent high heel with a thicker heel. If you prefer flats, try maybe some black gladiator sandals, or some just strappy sandals (I wouldn't invest a whole lot of money on new gladiator sandals though, because I think they are currently on their way to being out of style)<br>  <br>  I hated my dress code when I was in high school, and the only way I ever got around it was though lots of tasteful layering. Both the LBD (little black dress) and black cardigan are wardrobe staples, so invest to buy nicer ones, because they really won't ever go out of style (and if you take care of them they will stay nice for a long time).<br>  <br>  Cute dress though! It will be adorable in the summer when you don't have to deal with the dress code. Best of luck!!|`|0BspN06Raa	that is soo cute! :)<br>  <br>  yea definitely don't go with a hoodie... <br>  <br>  hmm maybe a super bright tank top or tee??<br>  <br>  like these:<br>  <br>  (this one comes in a million colors)<br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=176&subCategoryId=184&productId=18362" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <br>  (and this one too!)<br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=176&subCategoryId=185&productId=18368" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <br>  just wear some leggings underneath<br>  <br>  this link has sooo many leggings that rock!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/thumbnail.jsp?categoryId=102&subCategoryId=121" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/thumbnail...</a><br>  <br>  hoope this helps!|`|RvRe45seaa	wear a cardigan on top! but dont button it.. i think it'll look cute!<br>  <br>  ~`?
24wWxELuaa	They will make it look thicker, but they will damage your hair and ultimately make it thinner. I might suggest clip in extensions, they are much cheaper and don't damage your hair. They won't add a TON of thickness, but it will add a little, depending on how much hair you use.|`|ltnXWIpNaa	Go to a professional hair extensions salon, get a free hair consultation, and have them go over your options for volume.  There are a lot of good, quality hair extension options for volume, too many to list out properly.|`|wsOANC8haa	My friend, not hair extensin but hair weft, hair weft can make your hair thicker and no damage for your hair, you can have a try. .  I knwo one professional hair marketplace <a href="http://www.tohair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tohair.com/</a>  you can have a look , that is useful for you. Good luck !
oLj0VTX5aa	Before I give you tattoo advice, please read the following paragraph: <br>  <br>  Why would you want a a tattoo that would be deemed a "tramp stamp?"  I respect your want for a tattoo, but you will be stuck with the thing for a while, and I am not sure if you want the stigma of a butterfly on your back - you should find something more personal and meaningful.  <br>  <br>  THIS ASIDE - I was REALLY squeamish about having a tattoo done.  I recently had a tattoo done on my wrist - one of the more sensitive areas of the body.  I can tell you the pain is like having a sun burn and rubbing it against wicker really quick - it is not horrible and seems more scary than it really is.  <br>  <br>  My friend told me it was much like an annoying old cat scratching your mild sun burn, and it was.  The really important aspect to your tattoo is taking care of it AFTER you get it.  If the tattoo guy tells you to put a special cream on it (most tattoo artists will tell you to buy name brand diaper rash cream), follow those instructions.  An infection in your tattoo will not only hurt, it will ruin the tattoo, and it will flair up the lines in your tattoo, leaving scar tissue blurring part of the tattoo.  <br>  <br>  I don't know of tattoo shops that will either give you a local anesthesia or allow you to put any sort of gel on the skin prior to drawing the tattoo.  They take a needle and scratch the design into your skin, implanting the ink in the layers of the skin below, so you do not want anything on the skin to cause bacteria to be dragged into an open wound AKA fresh tattoo.  <br>  <br>  I have GIR from Invader Zim on my wrist - I redrew him myself adding a chef knife and a chef hat, as I work in restaurants and love to cook.|`|1m3Cjgmsaa	Don't get something unless they really means A LOT to you. and I don't mean your tattoo should be the name of your 16 year old school sweetheart ! I learned this the hard way. Butterflies and Dragons ? you can random pick people on the streets and have these tattoed on them. so be wise of your choice, find something unique, means something and really think about it.|`|sxk08R2caa	you're only 16!!!!<br>  why don't you wait a bit? you don't wanna do anything you'll regret later in life!|`|rQmBuXnaaa	its hurt alot alot alot if you think getting hit with a hammer in the eyeball hurts then the tattoo is gonna be murderous.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh wait your 16?<br>  <br>  dont worry it will be painless.<br>  <br>  congrats on moving up from the teenie bopper scene and going to the" another teen with a meanning less tattoo scene"|`|YtAkmjoyaa	If you really want this tattoo and is willing to get your mom to go along with the idea, stop fussing about the pain of the tattoo.<br>  If you're that scared of what might happen, mine as well just don't do it at all.<br>  +I'm not feeling the butterfly idea, though it's your choice and I hope it holds a meaningful message to you<br>  You're 16 you have a lot of time to really decide, 18 is legal age anyways. At least to go get it done yourself.|`|SW6fButzaa	The cream can be applied as anesthesia is not going to do nothing or very little, and you like to come if you use it, can also have negative effects secndarios. <br>  I have many tattoos and the best advice I can give is to go calm "the nerves affecting the lot in which the body makes dolor.porque segregates adrenaline porvoca more pain and this is strictly necessary", to secrete endorphins that relax just rioja contrast to the adrenaline and make you less annoying.|`|gNFPy6S0aa	Skin-numbing gel is completely pointless when it comes to tattoos.  A sub-cutaneous local anaesthetic injection will probably cause problems with the tattoo.  If you don't want it to look like ****, you're going to have to harden up a bit.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you're getting a butterfly on your back (shoulderblade or tramp stamp, I wonder?), so it's going to look like **** whatever you do.|`|OEZ57OUZaa	DO NOT GET A SKIN NUMBING GEL!<br>  <br>  Tattoos do not hurt. They feel good to me, and I have 3.<br>  <br>  The one on the back hurts a little bit because it's right on your bone, but you get numb after about 5 minutes. And even if you feel pain, it's nothing unbearable. All of my tattoos hurt less than my lip piercing. If you had the Gardisil shot, that shot hurts more than tattoos...way more in my opinion. Tattoo pain ranges from mild scratching to a flu shot maybe.|`|2jMFurDoaa	tattoos dont hurt as much as you think.<br>  <br>  at first they do feel strange but after awhile you get used to the "vibrations"<br>  <br>  (thats how i describe the feeling)

lyp6JEcEaa	DO NOT USE PETROLEUM JELLY! AAAAGH! I can't believe how many people respond on here that know nothing about what they are talking about. I am a skin specialist and a professional makeup artist and I can tell you do not use Vaseline. Vaseline aka petroleum jelly is made from MINERAL OIL, mineral oil is a petrol/petroleum based product from the petrol industry (think gasoline). It is a gross substance. Mineral oils molecules are too large to penetrate the skin so they do NOT moisturize the skin at all. They sit on top of the skin and clog pores causing acne. This is why it is known as a barrier cream because it creates a barrier, it doesn't penetrate.<br>  <br>  Now, Mac is EH, and so are mainstream drugstore brands because they use a very large amount of synthetic fillers and chemicals that do nothing for your skin, many of them can break you out or just leave you with a dull complexion. Natural/Organic brands, focus on the use of active herbal ingredients that can make your skin very healthy and radiant. Natural and Organic brands focus on feeding the skin with necessary nutrients. Oils are not bad for your skin. They are actually amazing for the skin, they contain natural occuring antioxidants and nutrients that can keep you looking young. The mainstream cosmetic brands tell you oil is bad so they can use a synthetic alternative (usually mineral oil-described above). They are all about making money and don't care about your skin. Why use real jojoba oil which is amaing for the skin but costly, when they can use mineral oil which costs pennies? I broke out horribly for years simply from using these products. You can check your fav brands here.........<a href="http://www.cosmeticdatabase.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmeticdatabase.com</a> they will tell you what is in them and how bad they are for you.<br>  All that said, if you want your skin to look radiant the best I have used in my field is Faerie Organics faery glow tinted moisturizer. This stuff is amazing! It is a natural face food with ingredients like shea butter, hazelnut oil, horsetail extract, you won't believe how radiant the skin looks. I use it on all my clientel as a base and it really adds a glow to the skin. You can check it out here........<a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com/catalog/c5_p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com/catalog/c5_...</a>|`|fqIE566Caa	Nelas Yard Frankinsense one? It leaves my skin feeling amazing but it takes ages to sink in. <br>  Clarins Hydraquench is pretty good, sinks in fast so is a good base for make up :)|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	You can spend a fortune on make up, moisturizer, toners,etc,etc, But keep your money and go to the dollar store and get petroleum jelly, use it at night then wash your face in the morning and apply a lite amount for the day along with sunscreen after. You face needs protection as much as it needs moisturized, the sun causes wrinkles and dryness. Some of the expensive cosmetics have chemicals that aggravate the skin and cause break outs and make acne worse. Stick to basics, mild ivory soap to wash your face, lemon juice rinse for oily skin, then the petroleum jelly to moisturize and sunscreen (45 sp) to protect it. I use mayo and olive oil mixed also once a week at night for a deep moisturizer. Also use only a little mascara and lip color, make up is damaging to your skin. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|5GW5xGCwaa	Honestly its Cetaphil.  The stuff is cheaper than dirt, but it makes me feel like I have baby skin.  I bought two 20 oz bottles for 11 dollars at costco.

2ZsRAxkuaa	Yay. I love medusas! Its next on my piercing list.<br>  <br>  I think it would look nice on you with small dainty jewellery. Probably look a little weird to start, with huge initial jewellery. But'll look amazing once you're able to change it.|`|tfqpb5XQaa	I've never really liked those piercings, they're one of the few i can't stand.

Don't let everyone else change your mind.|`|OjQpIa75aa	I'd say without.<br>  The piercing adds nothing to your face.<br>  You are already very pretty as it is so i would just leave it
0uSPPAb5aa	You need to get a product that works all day , Silk Infusion by chi is a great product for a smooth polished look or using more the wet look as you want.

Or else just put it in for a coupla hours. then you wash your hair like normal and condition like normal. It will make your hair softer and shinier and its good for it.<br>  I use olive oil on mine.

When it gets to the stomach, the hydrochloric acid in there breaks it down again into even smaller bits. Once it gets to the small intestine the food has been broken down so much it's more or less on big liquidy mixture containing all the fats, proteins, sugars etc. that were in the food you ate. They're molecules are SO small they travel through the wall of the intestine and into the bloodstream. It's at this point in which the majority of it gets used whether it means storing the fats because you've had too much, or using up the sugars as energy etc. <br>  <br>  Everybody absorbs their food so your question is slightly confusing. I took a look at that website and it doesn't contain much reliable information. If you're wanting to gain weight healthily, I suggest you go and see your doctor and they can sort out something for you. That website is a load of rubbish.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x

It works really good for my hair. Plus, it takes frizz away!|`|KeDIU7pkaa	Not an odd question, my hair was probably worse!<br>  <br>       There are some facts you need to know about dry hair.<br>  <br>  1.) Truth be told, mayonnaise doesn't work. Coconut defeats the purpose of shampooing.<br>  <br>  2.) Sadly, many Shampoo companies have made the mistake of making their shampoo so powerful, that not only does it rob the hair of grease and oil, it robs moisture as well. Try and use smaller amounts of shampoo.<br>  <br>  3.) A great thing to try is taking specialized shampoos and conditioners. Only use one type at a time, so as to not interfere with the other chemicals.<br>  <br>  4.) Silky hair isn't all about shampoo. Dry hair can also mean something else - you are chronically dehydrated. Wonder why so many teens have acne problems? Because at that age, they are most vulnerable to breakouts, and %75 percent of teenagers are chronically hydrated. another %15 percent are in between. The ones that are hydrated are the ones without acne. Drink six large glasses of water, and improvements happen weekly.<br>  <br>  This worked for me, hope it works for you.<br>  <br>  P.S: Good Luck!|`|G9ROTb9eaa	i have had horrible disgusting dry hair and im telling you that home remedies dont work! at least not for me.<br>  get a professional treatment in a salon weekly until you feel that ur hair is getting better, and then maybe you can get back to using hair masks at home yourself.<br>  its a fact that the hair masks in salons are way more moisterizing.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|2OqVlUFdaa	The salon stuff can actually harm your hair more.

dzbblpjgaa	It seems that it was a test of which mood you would prefer to see someone in. Yes, naturally you would prefer the smiling face. Confidence? it may show through in a smile, but it seems to me the profile of Suzanne is what appeals otherwise he would not have chosen her. Only by meeting her would he have a true picture of her confidence and character. Body confidence does not mean she is actually confident within herself. It just proves she is pleased with her appearance.|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	Why does make up enter into this? A little mascara and lip gloss is enough for anyone and is so much better for your skin. The natural look girls is best overall and you won't be sorry when you find you don't have a lot of break outs.

SWyzPPjpaa	oh my god. That's A LOT of hair dye. You can go to a salon and ask what they have some kind of mask they can put in your hair since nothing else seems to be working for you. I don't know if you live near a Cole's salon but that's what they did for me once. If you don't wanna do that I recommend a hair mask from Bumble and bumble. It's what I use. You should get Gentle shampoo and Super Rich conditioner they also have a variety of hair mask you can put on as much as you want and it should treat your hair. Type this in your browser and it should bring you right to Bumble and bumble's website; <a href="http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/hair.tmpl?filter=hairNeedsDry" rel="nofollow">http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/h...</a><br>  <br>  There products are sort of expensive and if you don't wanna splurge just go to Bed Head or Cat walk they have really good products for damaged hair. Like this stuff called Dumb Blonde bed head. It's for people who have damaged hair not just blondes haha yeah that works really well. And then there's also cat walk's oatmeal and honey shampoo and conditioner. It smells awesome too!|`|xrl0xTjTaa	shave it ALL off ha.<br>  or how long did you use the mayo<br>  for i do it four an hour thats how my hair<br>  was like hay withh bad split ends<br>  i do the mayo for an hour at night<br>  3 times a week and my hair is amazing<br>  go to the salon and get a condition treatment also

2ZsRAxkuaa	Don't rotate it. Its a curved bar, and they only go one way in the hole. Rotating it will make the hole larger and a funny shape. And tear the fistula, making it slow down the healing process alot. If you must move it to clean off large crusties, just slide the bar gently up and down a tiny bit.

SWyzPPjpaa	I wouldn't recommend washing your hair with washing up liquid. It will strip your hair and make it really brittle and damaged and since you just dyed your hair it's probably already damaged. Honestly the only thing you can do is wash it a lot so the color fades. If you try to dye it again it will absolutely kill your hair. Just be patient and wash it a lot.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	I think you should work with it instead of covering it up. You can always add more. I would suggest using a blond color for slim streaks in your hair to make it lighter. You can time how long to keep it in your hair for the shade. It will either lighten the brown to a copperish color. It will add a better and more natural look. :D|`|xrl0xTjTaa	it will fade within 2 weeks a bit mine<br>  alwaysdoes that|`|CEKZsoFRaa	If you didn't use bleach try a developer or rinse.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	Dont wash it with washing up liquid !

SWyzPPjpaa	You should just get a multivitamin for your hair,skin and nails. I take GNC Women's Ultra Nourish hair and it grow really fast and healthy. It contains all the vitamins you need because for all the nutrients your hair needs it would be impossible to take them all separately.

dae34b4ef56cf9f9a9c29d363b3c4bc8aa	In my opinion you can cut back on the cost dramatically by waiting a lot more time in between removal sessions.  To me, they are scheduled too closely and do not allow enough time for adequate removal but people are always in a hurry to get rid of it so they go back every six weeks or so - I would wait three months at least.<br>  <br>  You can shop around for price but always remember you need someone who really has a lot of experience with this and has the right laser for the colors you have.|`|NNx8PZncaa	check out e~raze.com<br>  I've recently had a tattoo removed using this method and recommend it.
jFMNW8Upaa	Haha. This is funny because just recentley my sister and I showed my brother in law pics of celebs without makeup, and he couldn't believe they were the same person!!!<br>  <br>  Most females i know look about the same without makeup on. (Unless they just wear a ton of it!!) Usually the only difference is that they appear tired, because their eyes are not as defined without makeup on them. And without makeup all their flaws show up, like acne or dark circles.<br>   <br>  I dont know why girls do these things to fool you guys. But u gotta admit, without makeup all the gorgeous celebs and models are not that pretty of a site!! But makeup, and the push up bras, are worn to appear more attractive to a potential mate.|`|Tjwhmn1Kaa	lol you sound heaps cute.<br>  <br>  wellllllll,<br>  some girls look good without make up (rarely)<br>  and some  girls look really bad without it (me).<br>  i think only becaise i have fair skin with freckles :@.<br>  but yeah,<br>  it depends on HOW MUCH make up a girl wears,<br>  as to how different she looks without it.<br>  if she always wears heaps of make up then she<br>  will most likely look different without it.|`|dB2fqrCgaa	Some women use make-up to match their outfit, some do it for fun, some do it to cover up things, and most of them [like me] do it to look younger, more mature, and prettier.<br>  Most girls don't wear make-up at all, and you can tell by the way they look.<br>  <br>  You don't need to be so sexist about girls wearing make up.<br>  How about you GUYS? Taking men enchancement pills and viagra?<br>  xD|`|TuTC4dwOaa	haha only some. we dont look entirely different, you would know who we were. its really just that our eyes look muchh smaller.|`|bOB6PZscaa	I know i don't look great without make-up on :L <br>  <br>  but not every girl will look ugly without it.|`|8jeg6CKvaa	I never wear makeup, and I'm pretty cute.|`|LDSL0DUiaa	Well there are some people who cover there natural beauty with tons of makeup and chemicalson their faces, thats how they look freaky. i barely use makeup, because I'm 13, and I don't want to look 50 when I'm actually 25. My mom says girls should start using makeup when their like 18. People should enhance their natural beauty. :)<br>  Like if you ahve blue eyes, mayb like use eyeliner to make them pop. I only use clear lip gloss, thats it.|`|U2TUFJh4aa	absolutely not! :)|`|rzm1ZDovaa	That's not true. i mean, there are some girls that put so much makeup, that they actually look totally different! what, you didn't actually think that all hollywood stars are THAT perfect?<br>  as for your gf, i'm sure that she's just using little makeup to look extra pretty for you.... <br>  <br>  and no we are not evil, and you guys are not so easy to fool lol :D|`|uahOuIekaa	Honestly the answer to your question is in your question itself. They wear makeup because some people ( like you) think they look horrible without it. also there eyes are real, they just might have eye makeup around them to make them look even better. Also maybe your girlfriend thinks that you'll think she looks ugly without makeup, cause you do seem to think all girls look horrible w/o makeup.|`|vrsQ1wMqaa	uh no i never wear any makeup when im around my friends and they still think im gorgeous|`|DhOjQM34aa	No way!!<br>  Loads of people don't wear make up cos they don't need it!
Jh0yyYizaa	Use blush instead,<br>  its more flattering and beautiful. x<br>  And its winter too, so it will look natural and pretty.|`|Q683orIMaa	I don't know why people are so obsessed with Nars Laguna bronzer. I bought it last year and ended up returning it. The color in the pan looks pretty but when you apply it looks so grayish. It has this gray undertone which i personally don't like. However, since you stated that you do not have a tan i suggest you give Nars blush in Nico a try. It looks really light in the pan but when you apply it, it has this very light brown/pinkish undertone which give you a natural tan look. If i were you i would try Nico because using a bronzer on skin which is not tanned can look a little fake.You don't necessarily have to buy a bronzer, you could try a mineral foundation powder or any powder in a few shades darker than your natural skin tone and use it to contour your face were the sun would naturally hit your face.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	try a light to medium self tanner or one with build able color that way you can control how much color you get. ones to try are clarons,lancome,jergens. apply it at night that way the next day you will have that sunkissed glow.|`|fCSGDpROaa	LAGUNA by NARS!!!!!<br>  <br>  Really pricey but definently worth it.  It is my favorite bronzer of all time.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P12790&categoryId=C10476" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a>|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	none.|`|JIel7eM5aa	prescriptives.<br>  i don't see why you need it though...a 'glow' should be achieved by a dewy finish of your foundation and contouring your temples and cheekbones...as well as highlighting your cheekbones.<br>  <3.

4CTv1iKpaa	I had the same problem. All you have to do is get a maroon color get some white mix it together and you have red! if you cant fine maroon. Use a orange and mix with a very dark yellow!<br>  <br>  And if you wanna get gold ( just a tip)<br>  get a clear polish and mix some maybelline gold eyeshadow in the clear polish. Maybe you can do that for your red nails.|`|ttzNKBj3aa	I used Speedy Hot Tamale, brand's Maybelline New York EXPRESS FINISH. It's like a very flashy, bright, very red color.|`|a4OgD9r7aa	Red nail polish is soooo in this season, i'm surprised you can't find it anywhere, I see it everywhere I go.

JIel7eM5aa	I don't mostly recommend Neutrogena...at all...but there's one product that could help you.<br>  <br>  Cleanser - Mario Badescu's Enzyme Cleansing Gel<br>  Toner - Mario Badescu's Special Cucumber Lotion<br>  Moisturizer - Control Moisturizer For Oily Skin (also helps skin suffering from acne)<br>  Acne Cream - DanielKern.Com's (founder of Acne.Org) Treatment with 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide<br>  Treatment -  Do you scar badly? If you have scars or do scar pretty severely, try Neutrogena's Acne Mark Fading Peel as a mask 2x weekly. If you're more worried about your acne, go for Mario Badescu's Drying Mask as a mask 2-3x weekly as well.<br>  <br>  Sorry I named more than 2 companies. I strongly recommend you try these products. They are going to be more expensive than Clean and Clear (*DON'T TRY PROACTIV), but they're well worth the investment and I'm positive you'll get clear skin. These products should last about 4 months each.<br>  <br>  MarioBadescu.Com<br>  DanielKern.com<br>  Neutrogena.Com<br>  <br>  1) To answer your question, unless you suffer from only teen acne and have not yet grown out of getting breakouts, it is true that when using ProActiv, if you stop, your acne will come back. But don't try it. For a lot of people, their acne never goes away! But with all skincare, you can't use it for a couple months and stop. It will only work if you are consistent, and continue to use it. That's the way it is with everything; you'll get used to it!|`|A6yROan9aa	i use the neutrogena wave. it really does make your skin super soft! I still have acne, but it has calmed it down. also you could try a moisturizer that prevents oily skin.|`|R8RVJ0Y1aa	Hm...<br>  <br>  I would say:   Neutragena - The orange tube version<br>                                         and<br>                      Avon Facial wipes - From the Avon catalog<br>  <br>  <br>  These treatments worked like a dream with me, and they don't stop working.

mp5Vg7Peaa	I have a very pale complexion too and a mac consultant told me to go for orange based red's, so i bought lady danger in a matte texture.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend:<br>  Mac-Russian Red<br>  Not quite as bold as lady danger but slightly less orange as orange tones compliment blue eyes best but work with other eye colours too<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  Benefit- Benetint<br>  With benetint its a lip stain which can be used for a pale red all the way to a striking red, all depending on how much you apply :)<br>  I actually love this :)|`|a4OgD9r7aa	If  you are going for a very high fashion look I would recommend red lipstick but with basic eyes, because if you go for dramatic eyes and lips you could end up looking like a clown, so be careful with that!<br>  And if you want to go for a natural look choose a nice shade of pink and then go for a nice eye shadow that complements your eye colour!|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	With pale skin, I would go with a deep red so you don't stand out in the crowd or look clownish. Revlon has some nice lip gloss in deep reds that I like and they are shiny too. Just remember to condition your lips with petroleum jelly each night no matter what lip color you use. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|BeSZ4nXraa	I just happened by the prescriptives makeup counter, and I really like what they do.  They match your skin tone with a pallette of makeup colors.  I also have wanted to try a red lipstick, but a lot are too orange for my skin, so I just figured I couldn't do it.  I have always known this intuitively, but never saw a makeup brand that does the work for you.  Skin has different undertones.  People often say "pale skin works with x" but I would try it and look like terrible.  So for me, prescriptives said I was a cool pale (meaning pale with red undertones) and there is a whole color pallette for cool tones (greens and oranges are not part of this pallette for me).  There is a beautiful bright red lipstick that is not too orange that is perfect for me, and it took the guesswork out!   You don't have to buy their foundation makeup, you can just get matched and buy a lipstick or something, or even use it for ideas and get a cheaper alternative.  Good luck!|`|P7lU3Y2Gaa	A bright, striking lipstick would flatter you the most, in my opinion. You do have quite a pale complexion, but this lipstick would brighten up your face and also suits your hair colour/style.

Learning basic sewing techniques (such as flat seaming, french seaming, fitting, easing, pockets, waistbands and beltloops, button holes, pinking, serging, welting, installing zippers ) and others will help make your idea easier to accomplish.

yNYUuT23aa	When it comes to makeup, eyeshadow is perhaps the trickiest product to apply. This is because the eyes have no real limitations. According to the makeup experts, each shape you create using eyeshadows can take you to different realms. Indeed, it was black kohl that transformed Elizabeth Taylor into Cleopatra and Audrey Hepburn into Holly Golightly. Eyeshadows do not only make your eyes look bigger, they can also add drama and draw attention to your eyes. However, it is one of the trickiest makeup products to apply, which explains why women do not wear it as often as lipstick. Drawing a perfect shade may often take some practice, but with a few expert tips and techniques, you can do it in no time.<br>  <br>  1. Select the correct eyeshadow form<br>  <br>  Eyeshadow comes in several formulations, each with a unique finish and level of difficulty. Matte eyeshadows blend easily and are perfect for beginners, as they can be both used for creating a soft daytime look or a heavy smoky eye. If you are not so much into eyeliners, you can opt for powder eyeshadows that can also be used as eyeliner, as long as the color is densely pigmented. Used in tandem with a fine-tipped brush, powder eyeshadow gives the softest, most natural look.<br>  <br>  2. Getting the natural look<br>  <br>  For soft definition, choose a powder matte eyeshadow. Choose those that are neutral in colors because these are the finest for all eye colors. The best neutral colors to choose are taupe, beige, muted wines, ivory, charcoal, browns, and grays. It is best to choose a medium eyeshadow. These types of eyeshadows are light enough, hence they do not need massive blending. For those who have dark eye colors, browns are the best shades to use in order to bring out the eye color, making it more intensified and defined.<br>  <br>  3. Consider your color options<br>  <br>  The safest way to go is with brown or black, but new options include other colors such as gray, charcoal, metallics, or even bright dashes of color like green, blue, or turquoise, as seen on the usual summer collections. Smoke or charcoal gives a softer look than black does. Dark green shades goes well with almost all complexions. For those who have complexions with narrower eyes, metallic shades are the best. When applied on the eyes, a metallic shade like silver or gold can make the eyes look bigger and more wide-awake. You can contrast this with a different shade of eyeshadow like green with bronze, silver with white, or go monochromatic by using lighter tones of the same color family as your eyeliner.<br>  <br>  4. The skin tone test<br>  <br>  When choosing the best eyeshadow, it is best if you consider your skin tone first. Usually, there are eyeshadows that do not blend well with one’s skin complexion. Hence, it is important to consider them when choosing eyeshadows.<br>  <br>  For example, women who have dark skin complexions, it would be better if you choose darker shades of eye shadows. Choosing lighter shades like pebbles would only make your eyes look dusty.<br>  <br>  5. The rule of thumb<br>  <br>  Before you buy your eyeshadows, it is best to remember that dark colors tend to make the eyes appear to diminish in size. On the other hand, light colors bring your eyes out into the open. The rule of thumb when choosing the best shades of eyeshadow is to select those that will bring definition into your eyes. In reality, eyeshadows are made to re-shape the eyes or any part that surrounds it like the browbone section and the eyelids.<br>  <br>  6. High definition<br>  <br>  It is best to smudge a soft brown eyeshadow on the lid for a wide-eyed look. If you want more intensity, smudge the eyes with darker shades starting from the center of the lid then outwards to make eyes look bigger.<br>  <br>  7. Limit the colors<br>  <br>  When choosing eyeshadows, it is best not buy too many shades, even if they are just neutral colors. Using them all together will be very distracting. Best of all, do not buy eyeshadows that will draw too much attention to your makeup as well as your lids. In the end, your eyes will be taken for granted. Therefore, it is better to not choose shades of pastel colors and those that are frosted. Indeed, choosing the best shades for your eyes can be very tedious and needs more practice but in time, you will soon be expert on it. In the end, projection high-definition eyes will be a breeze.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  also check these sites out....<br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10908496/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10908496/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Eyes-Stand-Out" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Eyes-St...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://free-beauty-tips.glam.com/biggereyes.html" rel="nofollow">http://free-beauty-tips.glam.com/biggere...</a>|`|n2LrFlxIaa	Wear blue cloths. ;]<br>  And loads of eyeliner.<br>  Dark eyeshadow that wont out-do your eyes.|`|WQcxODKLaa	eyeliner or eyeshadow, but don't put too much on .|`|zCaEkVccaa	Don't use dark eyeshadows or eyeliner!

Hope it all works out!|`|0mskPbaFaa	liquid eyeliner all round you eye (i reccomend GOSH/Rimmel London/Clinique) & then a metalic kind of white dusted around your eye, bolder around the eye, & then lighter as it blends into your skin. <br>  <br>  then have barely there lips & clear complexion with blusher :)<br>  hope this helps x|`|u5nYlVMxaa	Bit of eyeliner round your eyes and smokey eyeshadow will make them look defined and much bigger.<br>  <br>  :)|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	If you try to use eye liner to make them look bigger you will only get the raccoon look.

If i saw a tattoo of barbed wire on someone I would either feel they have a power issue and need to control things all the time or they have low self esteem and the barbed wire is there way of saying so in the sense that they are trapped. To me, that is not someone I would want to be around. Get something else I would say but ultimately it comes down to you and what you like. If you truly like that idea and it makes you happy then do get it.|`|H76IjEiPaa	If you do get a barbed wire tattoo, do it because that's what you really want.

It prevents stretch marks and also has the ability to remove existing stretch marks.<br>  The cream uses only the best known ingredients to diminish stretch marks. It's 100% safe and natural so you won't have to worry about any side effects from harmful chemicals.<br>  <br>  The Revitol stretch mark cream uses ingredients such as Squalene oil, which promotes healthy skin. While the vitamin E and grapefruit seed extracts work to strengthen the collagen elastin found deep in the epidermis. With your body being to utilize these ingredients it stimulates the production of your body's own natural collagen, thus your skin will become stronger and the elasticity will improve.<br>  <br>  The cream can do more than get rid of stretch marks, it will make it much easier for skin cells to rebuild their collagen matrix. Typically, this will also strengthen the surrounding skin tissue. As this deep healing progresses, you may even find that surface scar tissue will disappear. Depending on the size and depth of the scar, this may only take a few weeks.<br>  <br>  If you want to know more check out my source. <br>  Good luck!|`|8THz1sp9aa	Once you have stretch marks there is no turning back.

Check www.weather.com a week or so before you leave (they provide a 10 day forecast, but closer you pack to the departure date, the better off you'll be... check it like 3 days before you board the plane and you'll be fine) and watch the news to keep an eye out for any updates - like storms running across the country or up the East Coast.  New York's weather is crazy you really can never tell.<br>  <br>  I would personally suggest jeans, shirts (short sleeved should be fine), a warm jacket and a spring jacket.<br>  <br>  Most people who go to plays are in casual clothing.  When I go to see plays, usually I'm in jeans and a t-shirt, but abide by your superior's commands.  Just don't look ragged.  Look presentable.<br>  <br>  And semi-formal?

Or maybe you do I am not sure.<br>  <br>  Anyways, use a black/brown eyliner, and black mascara.<br>  <br>  Brown brings out the greenish color more though(:<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|iTjHRSqvaa	<a href="http://www.instyle.com/instyle/package/general/photos/0,,20239632_20238997_20540490,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.instyle.com/instyle/package/g...</a><br>  OR<br>  <a href="http://www.fabsugar.com/2601046" rel="nofollow">http://www.fabsugar.com/2601046</a><br>  <br>  your eyes seem a bit smaller so go thinner on the eyeliner and extend the line a little past the end of the eye to appear bigger, wear a soft pink when heavy on the eyes.

Trace your upper lashes with eyeliner(the color depends on your complexion and hair color) then curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler for about 20 seconds each eye. Apply mascara on the top..two coats usually works best. You may or not need eyeliner or mascara on the bottom of your eyes (unfortunatley i'm one of those that do) but be careful with eyeliner on the bottom..it can make you look like a corpse lol. But my absolute favorite mascara is lash stylist by maybelline. I've used all the new ones: colossal lash, lash stiletto, great lash, double extend..sooo many others but lash stylist works the absolute best for me. Eye shadow is not a necessity in my opinion, but if i do wear it, i like silver, grays and blues. Always use two or three colors, a medium shade for the lid, a dark shade for the crease, and a light shade for the browbone. Maybelline has the best eye makeup in my opinion. hope i helped|`|os4UoDFwaa	Love your eyes, to start.<br>  Try a quick line of liquid eyeliner on your lashline.

2qEfkSZOaa	Neutrogena Oil Free wash works amazing.Now I never break out.|`|Z6xJMssLaa	I have a number of options and recommendations:<br>  <br>  - Go to your GP and get a prescription for creme or acne gel.<br>    I highly recommend "Zindiclan" gel.<br>  <br>  - DO NOT buy face washes,cleansers etc... these can contain Alchohal and bad stuff for skin.<br>  <br>  - The neutrogena wave is a little machine that cleanses deep into your pores and prevents spots, all you do is add water. Apparently Vanessa Hudgens uses it!<br>  <br>  - a home made concoction is to mix asprin with water (make sure you crush 1-2 asprin tablets) and apply it to the affected area.<br>  <br>  - to cleanse pores another home made concoction is honey and almonds, mix it together and apply as face mask (works well)<br>  <br>  -just simply use a face cloth and water!<br>  <br>  hope this helped all of these options have worked for me.

We ask the experts for advice on how to keep skin spot-free. <br>  <br>  Why we get spots<br>  <br>    <br>  Stress, lack of sleep and illness can trigger spots. <br>   <br>   <br>  Oil-producing sebaceous glands that lie just below the surface of the skin are the cause of most spots.<br>  <br>  They secrete a natural oil called sebum through the hair follicles onto your skin's surface. This oil is the body's own moisturiser.<br>  <br>  Excess hormone can prompt these glands to produce too much sebum. And if the hair follicle gets blocked by dead skin cells, oil builds up with nowhere to go.<br>  <br>  'This build up of oil creates an ideal environment in which acne bacteria can multiply, triggering a chemical reaction and the formation of spots,' says Nina Goad of the British Association of Dermatologists.<br>  <br>  We have lots of sebaceous glands in our face, chest, neck and back – which is why spots are most common in these areas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Types of spots<br>  <br>    <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  Blackheads, also called open comedones, look like benign black dots on your skin. They usually develop in larger pores that allow air to get in and react with the oil and dead skin cells inside, causing the plug to darken and appear black.<br>  <br>  Whiteheads, or closed comedones, are filled with the same matter as blackheads, but the pore isn't as large. Air can't get in and react with the sebum, so it stays white.<br>  <br>  Both are milder types of spot, and for many people spots don't progress beyond this stage.<br>  <br>  If pores remain blocked, the build up of oil encourages normally harmless acne bacteria to multiply. This high level of bacteria puts the body's immune system into attack mode, causing inflammation.<br>  <br>  Red inflamed bumps are a sign of infected pores caused by acne bacteria, and usually require stronger treatment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Get a skincare routine in place<br>  <br>    <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  'A rigorous daily skincare regime is often enough to keep black and whiteheads at bay,' says Nadia Gabr, skin therapist and beautician at London's St James salon.<br>  <br>  'Cleanse, tone and moisturise morning and evening, using gentle products that won't strip or irritate the skin.'<br>  <br>  When choosing cosmetics and cleansers, opt for oil-free water-based products. Those that contain alcohol are best avoided because alcohol can be very drying, even for oily skin.<br>  <br>  You may need an oil-control cleanser to remove excess oil from the skin's surface. <br>  <br>  'Most contain salicylic acid, which loosens the binding of cells so they don't clump together and block the pores,' says consultant dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe of the Cranley Clinic. <br>  <br>  'Salicylic acid also has important antibacterial properties, so it can help prevent spots developing.' <br>  <br>  Just don't assume that you need products for oily skin because you get spots.<br>  <br>  Nadia Gabr says: 'Speak to a skin specialist before buying products designed specifically for acne. It might be that your skin is simply prone to congestion and an acne range might prove too harsh, making things worse.'<br>  <br>  Another mistake is to shun moisturiser, thinking it will trigger spots. Even oily skin needs hydrating, especially if you're using oil-control products.<br>  <br>  Nadia Gabr says: 'Don't skimp on moisturiser because you have oily skin. Instead choose one that is light and non-comedogenic, which means it won't block the pores.' <br>  <br>  <br>  Try<br>  <br>  <br>  Dermalogica Anti-bac Skin Wash 250ml ￡20.40 - gentle, naturally foaming cleanser with salicylic acid, antibacterial triclosan and soothing balm mint.<br>  <br>  <br>  Origins Matte Scientist 50ml ￡18 - super light moisturiser that won't leave your skin shiny.<br>  <br>  <br>  Nick Lowe's Oil Control Day Cream 50ml ￡14.95 - easily absorbed moisturiser with salicylic acid, antibacterial willow bark and UV protection. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Exfoliate every week<br>  <br>    <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  'Antibacterial facial scrubs can deep clean the skin, effectively clearing old skin cells that could otherwise block the pores,' says Dr Lowe.<br>  <br>  'Use scrubs with care and no more than twice a week, because the exfoliants can be harsh on the skin, especially if it is sensitive.'<br>  <br>  Scrubs or cleansers with fruit acids (alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs) can also help your skin to shed old cells.<br>  <br>  'They are often used in higher concentrations in chemical peels because they help clear the top dead layer of skin, encouraging cell renewal and brightening an oily complexion,' says Dr Lowe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try<br>  <br>  <br>  Nivea Visage Oxgen Power Reviving Cleansing Gel 200ml ￡7.75 - deep cleaning gel wash with microbeads.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bioré Pore Unclogging Scrub 140ml ￡4.99 - light foaming scrub with microbeads and salicylic a|`|lxRYFGM7aa	If they are brown spots try a little baking soda and warm water.|`|fyBWY8Cmaa	Clean and clear|`|fbReCs5jaa	clean and clear deep cleansing cream wash

AA10862126	You talk an awful lot.|`|5678371c4d9925ba2d26e6ba9c43fca8aa	First of all, you can't "make yourself more like a teenager."  Maturity comes with age and experience, and it's totally out of your control.  From experience, I know that trying to act older will only make you seem fake, because believe it or not, everyone in your grade (girls too!) is just as mature or immature as you are.  It also might lead you into developing bad behaviors like smoking or drinking which you might think make you seem cool and adult-like, but don't.  Trust me, a few people might like you or pretend to like you because of your "teenager" behavior, but most people will think you're a loser.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the harsh reality there, but on the brighter side, there are things you can do appearance-wise to make yourself look older, and there's nothing wrong with that.  I don't know where you live, so I don't know what stores are in your area, and I'm a girl anyway, so I can't tell you that many specific stores to buy cool guys stuff.  I think Hollister and Aeropostale might have the beachy style you're looking for, but I'm not sure, and I know Hollister is also on the expensive side.  <br>  A good place to start would be some department stores like Macy's and JcPenny.  They're about the same price as Kohls, maybe a little bit more expensive, but they always have sales (although some dept stores, like Bloomingdales or Lord and Taylor, are much more expensive.)  Kmart, Walmart, and Target are good too.  However, why don't you just take a trip to the largest mall near you, pop in all the men's clothing stores, and see what you like?  I know guys don't like to shop, but if you're looking for a new style, that's the way to do it.  Or you could look at store websites online, but that doesn't seem to work as well.  One more store I have to suggest is Old Navy, because it has amazing clothes at cheap prices... I don't know if you'd like it, but I do and so do a lot of guys I know.<br>  On the pimple issue, the best way to get rid of them is to wash your face several times a day.  I wash my face three times every day.  Especially when you get sweaty playing sports or something, you have to wash your face even though it's annoying.  Also, don't use just plain soap, especially not dove- it makes your face oily.  I don't quite know if guys do this, but girls use cleansers and stuff that are designed to reduce acne, you might want to try that.  After you wash your face, use OXY cleansing pads like once a day.  I know guys use these, and they work SO well!  There are also spot treatments to put on zits to get rid of them.  If your acne is really bad, ask your doctor to prescribe you a medication like Proactiv that's more effective at combatting acne.  But most people don't need this.  Just keep your face clean, and touch it with your hands as little as possible, and you should be fine.<br>  As for the tanner, I would advise against tanning.  Unless you're like albino, your natural skin color is almost always the best.  It's better to be slightly pale than to have the orangey skin that self-tanners give you.  Tans are overrated... people seem to think they make you look so much better, but I don't know anyone who looks attractive because of their tan, or unattractive because they don't have one.  Plus, if you use a self-tanner, people will probably be able to tell (that's because self-tanning looks fake & also because the change in skin color in September is just not natural).  It's not particularly attractive to use a fake tan, since it's FAKE, especially for guys.  I don't know a single guy who tans, at least at my high school, and I personally think that tanning, especially for guys, is more unattractive than having pale skin.<br>  Finally, as for the hearing aids, don't worry about them.  I know a girl who has hearing aids and she's very attractive otherwise and people don't notice they're there because SHE doesn't seem to care about them.  She can talk fine, too.  But, if you are always fretting about them, other people will be able to tell, and that's what would be bad.  You could grow your hair long, and it might look cool, but I don't recommend it.  A lot of girls have a problem with long hair on guys, so I think you'd turn away more girls with the long hair than you would with the hearing aids being more visible.  Plus, long hair gets messy and hard to deal with and it makes your face so much greasier since it gets matted against your head.   I can almost guarantee you you'd have more acne with longer hair.<br>  So overall, I'd just have to say, BE YOURSELF.  It's okay to try to look older, but make sure you're doing things that are natural for you that you're comfortable with.  But no matter what, don't try to ACT older.  If you do this, you'll just blow it and end up seeming even more immature.  Just be a confident yet nice and friendly person, and that'll help you more than any major change to your appearance can get you.  Personality is more important to girls than guys realize:  easy-going, nice guys who are fun to be with are attractive to girls.  I'm sure you already are that guy, so be true to yourself, and you'll get the girls (and the maturity.)|`|6946e33a272d9a642a5d210a7a284087aa	Thrift stores are actually a pretty good place for clothes.They're kinda hit or miss though.I'd say American Eagle or American Outfitters for the "beach" style.Or just look around,and incorporate things into your style!That's whats fun about it!Try Abercrombie if you don't mind throwing down 70$ for a pair of jeans with paint splatters on them.Old Navy is a bit less exspensive.<br>  <br>  Be very careful with tanners.Don't wanna look like an Oompa Loompa do you?<br>  <br>  Personaly,the h-aids aren't a prob.If it makes you uncomfortable,than go for it.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped!

U3fwQPcjaa	Mothers are generally more accepting of make-up on their daughters, because they too have been at an age where they started wearing and experimenting with make-up, Dad's however, just see their little girls (and they will always be little girls in father's eyes) dressing up and becoming sexual (because that's how men see make up), which is a scary thing for fathers!<br>  So, when you see your dad, try using a lighter color eyeliner, brown or something similar, and use it on the top lid instead of the bottom where it is more noticeable. The added advantage of this is it will make your eyes seem more 'open' and give you a fresh natural look (which other guys will dig)<br>  Good Luck!|`|9CYpX1J8aa	tell him its not too much and ur not dressing lyk a slut and if he still continues to say that ignore him (if you can)|`|ujnwIQhSaa	My dad is like that tooo!<br>  I think its a dad thing cause when Im with him Ill wear like just mascara..<br>  and hell be like oh too much!

Also, taking some biotin will help your scar tissue as well.<br>  <br>  And to point out the obvious, going to a new tattoo artist to touch up someone else's work... you might not get the results you want.

lV3Hk7M1aa	If i was vegan and lived that lifestyle, i would. Thats sounds really cool and its not just a dumb tattoo, it means something to you, and i think those are the ones that people don't regret. I think you should go for it. Maybe in like a pretty hand-written cursive type of font, like Pea Johanna Script.|`|F77AfkUIaa	That sounds like a unique tattoo. I've not heard of people doing that as far as vegan tattoos. I personally like it. <br>  I think all lower case letters would look the best.<br>  Like I said, it's unique and personal, which makes the best tattoos.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	I am old school - would never get a tattoo<br>  was vegan for two weeks - then found out the guy I was looking up to<br>  cheated<br>  <br>  sorry - I am no help<br>  <br>  all the best - hope it works for you|`|ZkrGttKaaa	Weeell, we sure can't have that! They might have you on an I.V. feeding you pureed squirrel meat that some burly redneck got in his sights, while being cute, going from tree to tree in search of nuts! (Now, that's enough to give yer stomach the slow roll, aint it?!) Anyhow, if I'm not mistaken, most of the 'roots and berry' people I know are women, like you. I like the font you picked, but have you considered script? At our shop the computers are loaded down with script to choose from. And we've got books of it too. (mostly in pieces!)

If it's something you are proud of (and us vegans are very proud!), then do it! It's your body, and you can get whatever you want tatted on it. You should let the world know you are vegan and proud! I've seen sevral people with "vegan" tats and they look really cool.|`|68d7cbba1ea93499ab834b05c97d3802aa	It sounds like you're really dedicated to veganism, so I doubt it'd be a tattoo that you really regret. If you're comfortable with the idea of having that tattooed on you forever, then go for it.<br>  <br>  One tip: If you're going to get a tattoo about being vegan, make sure that your ink is vegan. Most regular tattoo ink has animal fat (glycerin) in it, and I've read that black ink is made from burning animal bones down to charcoal. So, make sure that you find a tattoo artist who has vegan ink, so the meaning of your tattoo is upheld.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9VwHTzptaa	I think its a great idea! i have vegetarian tattooed on my hip and i love it. tried being vegan. got to 3 weeks. it was hard but its awesome that you have been for 5 years!<br>  <br>  anywho i like the letters you chose. maybe you can get it in a green shade, or your favorite color instead of just black.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peta2flickr/769166170/in/set-72157594161486933/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/peta2flickr...</a><br>  <br>  this one is cool cause its all leafy. but you should eventually get it how you want it!|`|OXOHoISraa	While I understand supporting a cause or a lifestyle, and I might get a tattoo saying so ( I am big into animal rescue and neuter/spay programs and tattoos. I have lots of zombie kitties as a reminder to keep harassing people to alter their pets until they do )  I would not get it on my wrist. It is a very visible location , which while it seems good will cause you difficulties in your life. Consider a location that could be covered if needed in the summer with you being miserable. If you are already heavily tattooed, then it doesn't matter.  If not, I don't recommend the wrist for a first tattoo.|`|XrMMH5tZaa	tattoo ink is not vegan,u have to specify u want vegan ink fyi...that'd be the biggest hypocrite tattoo if u didn't specify lol|`|O7LYxbKlaa	if i had the strength to be vegan, then absolutely!!!  that would look absolutely amazing, just make sure to get it done by a good tattoo artist!!

kLpMhl9laa	First, clean it with some peroxide. Then put some neosporin on it. If you don't want it to scar, make sure the scratch doesn't dry up.... apply neosporin or lotion to it so it doesn't. Good luck.|`|e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	Triple cream will heal it up. It has antibiotic, pain reliever and a healing agent in it. It heals stuff up real quick. My pediatrician is also a big fan of Bacitrin which you can get at CVS or Walgreens or the pharmacy department of Wal-Mart or Target.<br>  <br>  Mederma also helps prevent scarring. It's expensive so just get the store brand. Use it when the injury is nearly healed. It shouldn't be used on open wounds.|`|dyktmfg4aa	Don't worry.

WQiTQGdBaa	Use light shades of grey (so it's not so overwhelming with your light eyes), a little bit of darker blue around the far crease (blend a lot so it isn't too dark since your eyes are blue), and some light pink or white to blend and make it softer. You can also use shades that have a bit of a shimmer in them if you want to be fun, or use matte shades if you want to be more classy.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|nANyAvzgaa	Metallic or maybe go classic with Summer Dusty Rose|`|YhjTbSmDaa	If you look at an artist's color wheel, you'd see that blue is directly across from orange.<br>  <br>  That means blue and orange are complimentary, and contrast each other nicely.<br>  <br>  If you put a peachy-ish color on your lids, it will contrast against your blue irises, making them pop.<br>  <br>  You could definitely pull off a peachy eyeshadow, and a brown crease color.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Try something that may have a shimmer effect, Glitter effect not to much-- Darker gray, Maybe a gold|`|yzwiLmGSaa	go metallic with silver eyeshadow or go for a smokey eye|`|nmEvLJwxaa	Omg thats major emo, or ur just gay!

XrcZkt6Haa	not, they are not the same, while it is hard to distinguish. Drop earring Drop Earring refers to this style,<br>  One larger gemstone, geometric shape or charm hangs from the earring base normally facing forward. Some drop earrings combine a charm and a gemstone (crystal, diamond, pearls and so on). The basic design of the drop requires the earring to hang in a straight line from base to end.<br>  <br>  while dangle earrings Dangle earrings are designed to flow from the bottoms of the earlobes, and are available in various lengths from a centimeter or two, all the way to brushing the shoulders. They are generally attached to the ear by the use of thin wires, which go through the earlobe and connect to themselves in a small hook at the back. <br>  <br>  Here is more info about earring styles, and tip for choose proper earring, <a href="http://www.pearlhours.com/index.php?url=pearl-earring-styles-and-tips-article-65" rel="nofollow">http://www.pearlhours.com/index.php?url=...</a>

uDamZ74daa	Probably nothing--the tattoo ink goes much deeper under the skin than self-tanner. I think I put self-tanner on the day before I got my tattoo.

Of course we all want a handsome guy, no girl is gonna say ya i like short fat and ugly dudes....   It is human nature fora girl to want a guy to be bigger then her, we want to feel protected and safe, so naturally we want a guy who is taller then us. A guy does not need to feel protected by his girlfriend so it isn't a necessity to have someone taller then him, and most guys prefer someone shorter because he doesn't want to feel dominated, or insecure.  Girls preferences range all over for hair, many girls love blonde hair blue eyed guys, and just as many of us enjoy dark hair brown eyed guys.|`|czL4DjNlaa	<a href="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii162/lucylambrini/DSC00207.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii162...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Mmmm, tall dark and handsome ..|`|w4armmvyaa	Lots of girls like blond guys and prefer short ones so they don't have to stand on tip toes when they kiss!!! :-)|`|NdaU2BMXaa	should be well-built of course.<br>  it varies from girl to girl.|`|hH4WUq5Naa	i love me a bad boy :]

I was also very active with sports.  On my wedding day I weighed less than 110 pounds - I'm 5'7".  <br>  <br>  Now, nearly 17 years and 2 kids since I got married, I weigh almost 40 pounds more than when I was young and am getting hit on a lot....way more than when I was a young woman...It's the weirdest thing ever considering the magazines seem to be trying to sell this B.S. that very thin is so alluring/attractive....ish.|`|LzJJn1m7aa	No its disgusting I see it now that i have become regular and curvy i like it better now!|`|4uIHdzNGaa	i agree. its not the way we were intended to be.<br>  girls are meant to be distinctly different from boys. so if they are nothing but skin and bones,with no curves,doesnt that make the guys that like them gay? <br>  those type of girls need to get with reality and stop trying to make it a trend.|`|81b0c2959d4a4f6317cc2e7064ca1b71aa	I agree with you.

oK9WhUkiaa	it depends mainly on the quality of the eyeliner. if u go for an expensive one then it will be less likely to cause any problems. a cheap one might cause problems as they use a lot of lead (which is poisonous) in cheap products. <br>  i use a MAC liquid eyeliner and have never had any problem with it, even when i missed my eyelid and ended up painting a line across my eyeball. lol. so go for a good quality one ! =]|`|34K0QIzTaa	well it does have chemicals, but i use it everyday...and nothing is happening to me :)|`|tFIS2HbVaa	if it could damage your eyes, they wouldn't be selling it. eyeliner is okay, just don't forget to completely take it off before you go to bed.|`|uiGx0rPVaa	Maybe try some of the Organic eyeliner brand sold at Drug Stores.

It's just a little more expensive|`|sPDQIxJTaa	wow, hypocrite.<br>  so she wears it but tells you not too.<br>  LOL, wear it anyways.<br>  it's fine.|`|pDtEWH4Xaa	Its only dangerous when applying eyeliner or other eye makeup inside your eyelids can be dangerous, because the eyeliner stuff can flake off into your eye and scratch the cornea (clear front surface of the eye), making your eye more susceptible to a bacterial infection. This isn't very likely but it happens, so you should try not to risk it. Even though you see this commonly in magazines and stage makeup where it is used only occasionally, it is definitely not recommended for daily use.<br>  <br>  plus eyeliner looks much hotter on the top lash line where it emphasizes your lash line and makes your lashes look lusher, plus it doesn't look as harsh there as on the bottom lash line (application is harder but just practice)<br>  <br>  hope that helps =]|`|JjCqTCeXaa	To be honest I'm not really sure myself. But I would say that, yes, eye-liner is bad for you... in a way.<br>  <br>  All make-up has chemicals. But then again, you could say everything is bad, because a lot of the things we take into our body, we don't think about how much chemicals they contain, too. For example, fruits- farmers spray pesticides on them, and in turn we eat them. <br>  <br>  Doesn't really answer your question, so I'll answer it here. Make-up is bad, therefore eyeliner is bad. But everyone uses it so what's the big deal? Just don't use too much of it, and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  But if your skin reacts to the eyeliner/makeup you're using, STOP USING IT and visit the nearest doctor.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped!|`|u77I5Qfmaa	it kinda depends if your wearing an expensive liquid, or just a smudge on.Some liquids MAY have chemicals in them, only the crazy expensive ones though.I think that your mom just doesn't want you wearing eyeliner, im 12 i put my smudge, cheap, eyeliner on dark,she doesn't really like it, so i think you mom could just be making excuses you know. I'm honestly not sure though. Hope this helped!|`|cJd4SRL9aa	Technically, if it were really damaging to eyes, they couldn't sell it without a warning. xD<br>  <br>  I have really sensitive eyes, too.<br>  I wear it everyday.

0RTQXy2Naa	it cracked because you're not taking good care of it!<br>  <br>  this is why people's tattoos turn out looking like crap.<br>  <br>  ok, well you're already kind of pushing it with letting the touch up heal poorly, but you're not out of the woods yet. keep your tattoo clean but don't over wash it! like 1 time in the morning, 1 time at night, and put UNSCENTED lotion on consistently throughout the day. after it heals, the scarring should dissipate over time. when your skin is no longer shiny then you can get re-tattood. this time, just take better care of it!|`|9Z31gnvKaa	There is a thing they can do, this happened to my bro too. They can go over the scarred area(not sure if you can do on just lines) and re-shade in a certain way that breaks up the scar tissue and makes it heal better. My bro jus had this done and it looks amazing, dont even look like the same tattoo. I would suggest getting the opinion of a professional tat artist.. even if it costs more it will be worth it.<br>  <br>  also as callista said, TAKE CARE OF IT this helps the healing process tons|`|Yfgf47lBaa	it cracked and didn't heal proply because you didn't keep it moist.<br>  where you using any cream? and cling wrap at night?!<br>  did you wash it a few hours after it being done?! then pout cling wrap and cream? *i used bepanthen, its nappy rash cream, worked really well* (www.bepanthen.com.au)<br>  <br>  i think if there is no scar tissue under it, or only a little scar tissue then you can get it touched up.<br>  <br>  i had to get mine done again over the top, the whole tattoo, it hurt a lot, but it healed really nicely.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rtx0YQDJaa	yes you can get it touched up again. the wrist is a difficult area to heal however you should not have cracking scabs... that means it was under moisturized. give your wrist a rest from getting tattooed. your just reopening damaged skin so give it a break and a good amount of healing time before you go back yo get it touched up again. this time around make sure you are moisturizing it with a non scented lotion. you don't need a lot, just enough to keep it hydrated... say 3 or 4 times a day.

5678371c4d9925ba2d26e6ba9c43fca8aa	I don't think there really is one "best" type of makeup.  The general rule for wearing makeup and looking good is to accentuate your best features (for example, brown or purple makeup tends to really help bring out my blue eyes) and to improve your negative ones (people with blemishes need cover up, people with light-colored or few eyelashes should use mascara, etc.)  Never wear too much makeup- it makes you look desperate and insecure.  Dramatic makeup (the smoky-eye effect, red lips, a lot of eyeshadow, etc) can be worn on some occasions, like going to clubs or concerts.  However, how dramatic you want your makeup to be is mainly a feature of your personality.  I personally feel uncomfortable with dramatic makeup, others love it.  Even with bold makeup choice, however, it's usually toned down by making only one aspect stand out.  For example, red lips stand out and look good when paired with light blush, little mascara, and neutral eyeshadow. <br>  In a sentence, the rule of thumb for wearing makeup is to make you look like you're wearing no makeup at all, although this is actually an exaggeration.  But in general, you should play around with different makeup styles and see what you feel comfortable in and looks good for your face.  There is no one look that looks good on everyone, and you are likely to find something that is great for you if you test a lot of things out.|`|AA12043155	It depends on your skin differences - whether or not you have super oily skin - try to go to a beauty site, or something like cosmogirl.com. Or you could go to a store like Meier & Frank (Macy's) and ask one of the beauty experts. THe best way to wear it also depends on skin/eye/hair tones. Also on what kinds of clothes you wear.

i94f0RoJaa	The way I have always done it is this and you can use as many strands as you want.  The more strands the wider the bracelet.<br>  <br>  Basically, you measure the strands and tie just one end of each strand together, pin to a pillow or whatever.  Then,  starting at the left, you hold the second to the left string and tie a figure-4 knot  around it and pull it to the top of the second string twice.  Do this all the way across til you have tied the first string to all the strings and it ends up as the last string.  Do this over and over until its as long as you want.  Hope this makes sense.  Its kinda hard to explain.  You should be able to find instructions and pics on the internet.
tFIS2HbVaa	a primer creates a barrier between your skin and your makeup. when you use a primer, makeup doesn't touch your skin. i think you're allergic to bareminerals foundation(?) makeup(?)|`|shWh9OPnaa	It definitely sounds like you're allergic to your foundation.

RPd66ldYaa	The absolute BEST BRAND of makeup (which can cover up the circles and freckles) is MAC. You can look up the locations where they sell it on their website. At the stores they can do a consult and put the makeup on you to show you how it works or the right foundation. I've been using it for 8 years and people used to call me Porcelain Doll because of how clear it made my face look apparently. After using it, I would never use another brand unless I couldn't get this stuff...|`|P4DucVENaa	Try Smashbox, camera ready full coverage concealer, is amazing!!! it covers everything.

OHfZFR31aa	Most agencies start signing models at 14, some are even 13. Height is 5'8" - 6'1" so you are not too tall unless you keep growing. I don't know any models over 6'1" - Jodie Kidd is 6'1" and she was one of the tallest runway models.<br>  <br>  Plain is good for modeling as long as you have good clear skin, large eyes and high cheekbones. Agencies like plain looking models because they are often the most versatile - you can easily change their look depending on the hair and makeup styles.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Models are at least 5'9, maximum 5'8. You are definelty tall enough. <br>  They have high cheekbones, and a great face structure. You have to be thin, but dont have to look anorexic. Also have to have a good personality. chances are if you have a bad attitude and dont listen, (ex) Naomi Campbell) you wont get booked. If you post a pic, ill tell you if you are model material.

Nsvjecixaa	Hi! Okay, I'll answer your question first: it has to be 10 inches in ponytail form, tip of ponytail to elastic. If you have curly hair, you can straighten it to make it 10 inches long. Hair has to be clean and dry. You CAN have dyed hair if it hasn't been bleached; you CAN'T have highlighted, bleached, or gray hair.<br>  <br>  That said, I'm going to ask that, if you were thinking about donating, you don't donate it to Locks of Love.<br>  <br>  I wanted to donate my hair too, and ended up doing some research. Last year, about 10,000 ponytails were donated; 9,826 were rejected and sold instead. Add that to the fact that they have over $200,000 in charity donations anyway, and you have a very rich charity that doesn't give much (they only made 113 wigs in 2002, for instance). <br>  <br>  I saw all that and researched a few other places...I'm giving my ponytail to Pantene Beautiful Lengths or Wigs for Kids ;) Good luck, and you're a very selfless person if you're thinking about donating your hair!|`|AA11672248	Have you tried the official website for "Locks of Love"?<br>  You can get the information that you're looking for there.

kCdISEGqaa	If it is illegal in your state to tattoo minors, even with parental consent, it is illegal to tattoo a minor, with parental consent, even if the shop is closed.  It is still a licensed artist who is tattooing the minor, and they are breaking the law.  It would be like smoking in public, a lot of states now forbid smoking in public places, so if a bar closed and allowed the employees to smoke in the bar after hours, the bar could still get in trouble.  Hope that helps.|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	its not illegal. most places WONT do it unless the parents are there. when i was 16 i got my lip pierced, but they needed a copy of my mom's ID my school ID and my birth certificate because me and my mom had different last names.<br>  they can get in trouble if they tattoo/pierce a minor.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	No, just usually you have to have permission first.|`|7JiichhVaa	hmmm....maybe i think|`|NNx8PZncaa	I think you'd be lucky to find anywhere that would tattoo anyone under 18! a tattoo is a huge decision, I had one done when i was 16 and have just gone through the nightmare of having it removed.

zluGB6CJaa	Hey, you sound a lot like me! i sometimes have no idea how to wear my makeup, but heyyou can experiment!<br>  <br>  If i were you, i would go for a natural look or if you are feeling more daring, go for some glitter eyeliner. Keep it very subtle and a very slim line of glitter eyeliner along your top lid can be very striking and can really bring out you eyes! Use colours though - turquiose, silver, purple etc. Use the colour that matches you outfit! <br>  <br>  Keep your hair down and do you straigten it? It would be really nice just straight and with a sparkly clip or simething! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck xo|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	At 13 you want to be concerned about keeping your skin healthy and not getting break outs rather than wearing a lot of make up that is not needed. You have a healthy glow at your age, just use a little lite lip gloss. Prolonging the use of make up will be the best thing you could do for your skin. The only thing I use is mascara and lip gloss and I don't have acne or skin break outs like some people who are heavy make up users. Make up clogs your pores and the chemicals are very drying to the skin plus the natural look is much better. And personally I think 13 is too young to wear make up, 16 is OK I think. Think of how you want your skin to be years from now and forget make up, just do the gloss. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T

Vge3KBaMaa	i use olay eyemake up remover as i wear waterproof mascara and it always does the trick its only about 2.99 so its good value for money make sure you use damp cotton wool pads !!|`|P7lU3Y2Gaa	There are many different brands of make-up remover, but I recommened two things.<br>  1. Simple Cleansing Facial wipes. These do not use harsh chemicals that will damage your skin and remove even waterproof make-up.<br>  <br>  2. Toner and cleanser. This comes in a bottle and you apply with a cotton pad. It cleanses your skin and also removes dirt and makeup from your face.<br>  Goodluck!|`|aQIXj6bVaa	I use ponds facial wipes and I love this stuff. I use waterproof mascra and I have really sensitive skin that anything could easily make my face swell or just red/rashy. And this product is very gentle on your skin and removes a great amount of makeup off your skin. It ranges 4-6 bucks depending on where you buy them. I got mine at Walmart but double check Target...their stuff is usually cheaper.|`|c78b02eb1a997ddefb20d7db451dad32aa	Neutrogena make-up remover wipes or oil-free make-up remover|`|aUUHXC5Taa	Check this link: <a href="http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/02/best-beauty-products.html" rel="nofollow">http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/02...</a><br>  <br>  It has best make-up remover for eyes, face and cleanser.<br>  <br>  Also the best products for lips face ad eyes.

SwIyj8JTaa	i love bobbi brown products, if only they didn't cost an arm!  try prestige cosmetics, they have a great under eye concealer.  but to cover freckles bobbi brown's stick foundation is great, for a less expensive alternative, there's mac and sonia kashuk, especially the green concealer.  if you would look at the color wheel, red or pink is complimentary or on opposite side to the greens, so in they cancel each other out.  <br>  the mac green one is on the mac pro though, the sonia kashuk has a pallet of 4 cream concealers in one pallet, use the peach colored ones for the under eye circles, where the light green one on your pimples, good luck!|`|Q683orIMaa	I use Bobbi Brown's creamy concealer kit which is by far the best concealer i have ever used and does not make me break out, unlike Mac.

1jpzEMadaa	Unless you're severely malnourished, the rate of your hair growth would remain constant, vitamins or not. The vitamins just help you build healthy cells. <br>  <br>  But for healthy hair, there are other considerations too--e.g. if you constantly expose your hair to hot water, if you comb your hair too much and rip the hair, if you eat food that blocks the absorption of vitamin supplements, etc.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	prenatal pills and folic acid won't do anything but make you more acceptable to getting pregnant! you have to be pregnant for your hair to actually grow faster! You need to take Vitamin E pills, they will help you.|`|O64W8niHaa	no they don't they are rubbish
Q683orIMaa	Well first of all, you shouldn't buy a foundation that makes your skin look dry. Try Bobbi Brown's oil free foundation or if you have combination skin like most of us try Bobbi Brown's new skin foundation. When it comes to  oil-free foundation i think Bobbi Brown is the best.|`|MwvA8v17aa	i have more towards dry skin so i honestly cant give you best advice<br>  but dont use lancome pressed powder.<br>  because the sephora clerk pursuaded me to buy it.<br>  and its $35 of crap & stings my skin and doesnt even make a difference<br>  <br>  haha so any brand but Lancome i guess.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	mineral powder - clinique's almost powder|`|yWoK9ryJaa	As a professional makeup artist for over 20 years I will recommend a brand you can buy online and they ship to Finland with discounts.<br>  <br>  Bee Luscious Cosmetics, Liquid Minerals or the new photo touch mineral foundation these products are a liquid to powder formula that never cakes up at all even when you do apply the matching pressed powder on top. My clients rave about this formulation.<br>  <br>  I found for you a couple of reviews on youtube you can view to get additional information on the quality.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12ycA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12y...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPv_POaTTZ8&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPv_POaTT...</a>|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	neutrogena.|`|lyp6JEcEaa	I am a professional makeup artist and skincare specialist of 10 years. I can tell you to start you really must find the right formula for your skin type. Aging/mature skin does best with tinted moisturizers or creamy foundation, dry skin does best with liquid or tinted and oily skin does best with powder based formulas, the best actually being mineral makeup. Not all mineral makeup is the same as not every company is the same. I have tried around 20 different mineral makeup brands and they where all quite different from each other. <br>  Mineral makeup is the best for oily skin as the powder will stay longer and absorb oils throught the day. I have used Bare Escentuals in the past and they wore off very quickly and left me greasy looking, Drugstore brands are loaded with fillers and chemicals that are not needed and can further acne/oily skin. Stay away from brands that use bismuth oxychloride as this is a known skin irritant with a high allergy rating. I have tried so many brands and the one that I found to show the best results for oily skin is Faerie Organic Minerals. Their foundation does stay on all day, it absorbs excess oils, covers very well, yet looks like your own natural skin. Trust me there is a difference in the quality of brands. Faerie's uses a mineral called Boron Nitride which is antibacterial and a skin perfector- it is also this ingredient that helps it to stay on all day. You really need to check it out. They have a free sample kit and they ship worldwide. I have seen a store selling it in the UK. Their website is <a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a>|`|SwIyj8JTaa	i've heard good reviews about revlon's color stay with softflex SPF6 for combination oily skin...<a href="http://www.revlon.com/productcatalog/productdetails.aspx?productid=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.revlon.com/productcatalog/pro...</a> .  i'll try it out now that it's summer and the humidity is really bad.  bobbi brown is very good, too, but on the expensive side, and less available in countries outside the united states or canada.  i mean bobbi brown is only available in one posh department store here in manila, philippines.|`|dKVByRPTaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.I would check out the review site at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|IA123dWLaa	try using e.l.f.'s (eyes lips face) concealer powder/foundation/blush set. if that doesn't work, try urban decay's sponge on podwer foundation over the concealer powder from elf. ^.^ hope this helps...

If I'm in a hurry, I shave. I noticed a difference when I shaved and when I plucked. When I used tweezers the hairs didn't grow fast and not all at once, and not as thick. When I shaved, they came back out quicker and thicker.<br>  Haven't tried waxing yet, but maybe will someday.|`|AA11525569	i shave.. waxing would hurt so much on the underarms! lol if its really bugging you, you could use a hair remover like nair.. only try to find a different one because nair is pretty harsh. <br>  <br>  i have darker hair and i just make sure to shave really close, and it works fine lol.. <br>  <br>  you could also get laser hair removal, but thats pretty extreme|`|mZj5dASuaa	I usually shave...but waxing lasts longer so I'll switch soon.

Of course I would love to have someone who has a great personality and a good sense of humour, but it also helps if their face doesn't look like someone has smacked a frying pan over it.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	To be honest, if they had a great personality but not very hot, i would start to find them attractive any way.|`|632BbbUtaa	looks matter. but personality is very important as well|`|PsNXOjiJaa	yes|`|hehqSpW1aa	If the person is shallow, they will matter.<br>  Some people not so much,<br>  <br>  Its hard to tell who is effected by looks, the easiest way is to simply see who they are dating etc...<br>  I see attractive guys with not so attractive girlfriends, but I imagine a lovely personality... and the other way round too...<br>  <br>  Beauty is of course in the eye of the beholder : ) Whether a beautiful inside/outside (or both?)|`|gCAoXG9Baa	looks matter to an extent in my opinion.<br>  if you can find someone that is good looking and has an amazing personality..great, hold on to them for as long as you can.<br>  but if all's you know is a bunch of hott assholes and a buncha sweet nerds..bottom line? go with the sweet nerd, he'll most likely begin to look atractive in your eyes anyways..and thats all that really matters right?<br>  <br>  thats how i see it:)<br>  <br>  but my mans fiiiine and sweeet:):)|`|zWKotNvZaa	I am no oil painting but I think i'm a nice person and people see that. I try to make an effort with my appearance but 4 me and no1 else... however the world is shallow and yes , I think people do care more about looks than personality!!|`|15BDwSlTaa	i think looks do matter at first as that's what gets the attention. but if they have a bad personality then their looks aren't going to go very far!<br>  looks get the attention, personality gets the heart!! :D x|`|xn7amAYVaa	to me looks are just a bonus. if i find a guy who has an amazing personality and knows how to treat a girl i would go out with him. and if he is hot thats just like a cherry on top.|`|B20aEPkqaa	I think looks matter initially but personality is equally part of it, my imgainary friend sam said it doesn't matter to him, his type is any female with a pulse|`|IduMEIJsaa	They say 'never marry any one who's good looking' and I would say that's right. Personality is what counts. Once your fond of someone they become good looking|`|PgOWFjNBaa	I 100% agree with Scene_It_Baby (well said btw)
lPCjNkEnaa	It's actually impossible for people with brown eyes to look like they have blue eyes with colored contacts. I would normally say the last one, but I don't think a girl with brown eyes can pull it off. Now to deal with either the 1st or 2nd one. Well, if your hair matches the color of the brown contacts get those, because girls who's eye color and hair color match are beautiful, but if not, then get the 1st ones because they will still stand out.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Third is pretty - but so fake looking.  I would rather go with number 2 and MAYBE number 1.  <br>  I dn't like it when people wear blatantly fake colour eye contacts like the third one.|`|5gDSiUVCaa	The 3rd is beautiful :D|`|sNr9Od89aa	the third one is pretty, but a little fake. i choose the first one.|`|gFNCIJsfaa	absolutely the second, golden brown is stunning, the 3 is too unatural and the first is just too plain.|`|II8duVtMaa	woahh, definatly the last one! they all on you though? need to make sure they look right, all look nice mind :)|`|CI9J6x3daa	Why would you lie to people about your eye color? Thats kinda dumb.....  people dont liek lyars<br>  But the 3rd is beautiful|`|evEJxv06aa	i think the blue ones are very pretty i mean the other ones are cool to but blues ones are the best.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	3rd is gorgeous...it's like aqua.
NCvvwPEdaa	Some guys are really very disgusting and sick. All this they do only for satisfying their physical hunger and for this hunger woman becomes prey and suffer. This should not be happening but what to do about these mentally sick people. In my opinion these rapist should be hanged to death in the middle of the road by the victim women. Our society is not secure and our law is not that hard against these rapist. This let these people do nasty things. I really am very pissed off and if possible want to protest against them.|`|yPjbKop0aa	well, the boys that did this were from a village called "garhi chowkhandi".we have urbanised cities which are surrounded by villages which have not changed and are caught in the time warp. there is a big swanky mall near the village i.e about 2km from this village and it appears as if we have come in another world. this incident happened because of uneven development. the village folks said that they will support the boys no matter what and the boy and girl were sitting in the car and that they were in the objectionable position. these village youth have not been properly educated and they have seen how women folk in their village is badly treated and dominated upon by males. that is why they did this.|`|AA11525569	what does this have to do with beauty and style?<br>  <br>  this doesnt have to do with men being more powerful than women.. there were ten of them and one of her, gender doesnt necessarily determine strength<br>  <br>  only some cultures such as the islamic culture under suria (sp?) law consider rape to be the woman's fault. <br>  <br>  and yes, this is cruel.. its always sad when these kinds of events take place, its even more sad that they are so common and they occur frequently around the world.|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	yes some men are pigs, and some women are bitches (remember the cheerleaders from florida?) thats the way the cookie crumbles.<br>  <br>  PS. most males that would see this sort of action would jump to help any women in that situation. at this party, we watched this guy try and rape some overly intoxicated girl, and we beat him to an inch of his life and then called the cops. most men dont stand for that|`|cUaBLayfaa	i don't know how can some GREAT  people shout for being in a country that respects women equally....and is blaming the western culture for these things....and ...and can't stop being garrulous over the issues....that they still have highest respectable traditions(if raping women is comes under their tradition..then i feel pity )......its not that m being negative...but its everyday story..small or big....some r discovered....n some remain undiscoverd.....then how can we boast of being religious.....no religion teaches....such low grade things....|`|Z6xJMssLaa	Some males are physically sick people! How revolting! Males are more physical than women, women are more emotional, nice and friendly creatures god it makes me sexist that article how awful! The things men do!(i am not usually sexist, but sorry).|`|109416878bd099082f4e541617b3b97caa	And the Sarpanch calls it a trivial matter.... Like a Husband kissing his Wife behind closed doors!!!<br>  <br>  Really do hope that the girl manages to get over this|`|4oUmdnz6aa	hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii sexy|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Lillian is right. About 3% of the male population here are born sadists, because they are sociopaths (they used to be called psychopaths), and this is not the only disorder that can cause frenzied cruelty. I should point out that about 1% fo the female population falls into the same category., and there are cases of women raping men with objects and of even raping their own children with objects. Nevertheless is is a broadly male phenomena. <br>  People need to be prepared for these kinds of people. Carry Mace or maybe a can of Easy Off Oven Spray to drive off attackers, and you and your bf could benefit from studying a martial art for a year or so. You'd be amazed what an effective weapon a stick is against multiple opponents. And, it's also a good idea to get a big dog that at least looks ferocious.|`|fpGqmFKvaa	that is so horrible and disgusting, you don't know why people do this, is it because they like to see people suffer?|`|V5AliBPMaa	Yea its gross but when you see a bunch of people circling your car you don't just sit their and wait for them to do what ever they are going to do, obviously they are going to do something bad so try to stop it, I would lock my doors and run them over I don't give a **** I would rather take that chance then being raped.|`|GllB4mPZaa	This is worst.A district wise data including photo of rapists should be displayed on a particular website and TV channels and they should be expelled from society.Law is impotent in this regard.|`|2vOxsVGQaa	this is soooo disgusting and those ppl are sick!!!!<br>  I always wonder how anyone could do such an awful thing<br>  and you're right...girls shouldn't be blamed when they get raped....<br>  we are weak...what do they expect us to do ?????|`|YJGEEJhWaa	I know its horrible! it was start to really hurt as well :(
YEpBnVKIaa	just use loofah
nxpbj5HWaa	no, i use washing up liquid sometimes when i get a build up of shampoo. it makes your hair literally squeaky clean. make sure you use conditioner and wash it all out properly. i wouldn't use it too often, i only do it every once in a while.<br>  i don't think it would remove your colour though, you might have to buy a home dye kit and dye it yourself if you can't afford a salon treatment.|`|U3fwQPcjaa	Do not use washing up liquid on your hair! especially if you just coloured it, please don't! Washing up liquid is much too harsh for you hair especially if it is already stressed after being dyed.<br>  As it has only been a day since you have coloured it, I would recomend taking a week before you do anything, that will give the dye time to settle and all the excess colour to wash out.<br>  If, after that time you decide that you still hate it, you can try putting some highlights in, I wouldn't strip the colour for at least 2 weeks, if not longer if your hair is in bad condition.<br>  Just put it down to a live and learn situation.|`|R8RVJ0Y1aa	Hun, why no way should you use washing up liquid with your hair! I suggest that you have to either bear your new look, or buy a different dye.<br>  <br>  The washing up liquid could do all sorts of bad things to your hair! I once had a friend that dyed her hair too dark, so she used washing up liquid but her hair went green! Sorry, but washing up liquid is a really bad idea!!|`|7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	If you used permanent hair color, nothing will wash it out. You don't have to strip the color, you can just dye it a lighter shade. But you should wait about 4 weeks before coloring it again.|`|rqYy0RJVaa	Much too harsh. Too alkaline, bad enuf for non coloured hair, let alone coloured hair? Do it if u want, but u will have ruined hair and u will have to go to the salon to fix it and that will cost loads.

DHR04WTHaa	Look amazing on some, make others look uglier than they really are:-) Get bangs if u have a long-ish OR oval/heart shaped face, but not if you have a round or square face :-) Also they look better with thicker hair to get a fuller fringe so if you have thinner hair at the front, I wouldn't get them :-) Good luck|`|5sCpMpbWaa	yeah i like them , i also have a straigth across fringe myself i think for you to try it , and if you dont like it , who cares it grows really quickly.|`|kt89NRWvaa	It sometimes depends on the shape of your face and the texture of your hair, but I like them and think they look good on most people. <br>  Go for it!!|`|NDqDFnGyaa	Like Lady Gaga-ish?<br>  veryyy veryyy veryyyyy veryyy cute. i'm accually thinking about gettin them meself :)|`|1o6bzLVbaa	it depends on your face shape.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOAAI3D31KQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOAAI3D31...</a>

qeNrGoMsaa	You would definitely have to lift it and bleach is the only way. You may end up ruining your hair. I would suggest a salon.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	if you want your hair as light as the picture you are going to have to bleach your hair before hand.
JjBSEaGoaa	it looks nice..<br>  <br>  i dont know if id go to great lengths to get it done, you look fine without it . but it is nice|`|iMLrUrdbaa	Sorry hunni <br>  but i think you look better without <br>  xx<br>  <br>  your really pretyt though|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	it looks like a zit that sparkles. nothing on a girls face is usually that attractive
eMSv7RwYaa	i think it should be fine to use this dye. Just make sure that the dye states on the packaging that it is suitable for blonde hair and there should be a little picture of the shade the dye will be on blonde hair. If it looks dark enough to match your natural hair colour you should go for it.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	How light are these blonde pieces? Does the brown match your hair colour to a t? Only way is to do those pieces first and then do the rest of your hair. Hopefully it will even it out. It may take this time and one more time before it all matches. I would treat your hair though after to a good moisturizer and do a deep olive oil treatment in the week if you feel it's dry. Olive oil rinses out the next morning fine. You need to shampoo twice and no conditioner. When you set you hair after use a serum to protect it during the day.|`|4QFfnzWHaa	it won't be totally uneven.. but where the blonde is will change to brown or the color of the dye and it may even darken your other hair a lil bit.. it won't lighten your natural hair if its darker then the dye though... you should go to a salon if you want it even.. it wont do it with a box a dye <br>  <br>  good luck :)<br>  btw.. girls would die to have natural blond highlights with dark hair!

Do not go all blonde.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Maybe a dark blond, with lighter blond highlights... but not light blond overall.|`|ia3XD8KDaa	I wouldnt yur really preety and do like the white ish streaks|`|szvL591iaa	yeah, you'll look hotter.
iUW19Sofaa	wahl healthy infusions ionic hair straightener<br>  <br>  <br>  i'll add more details in a few minutes... i'm a little busy right now... <br>  <br>  but seriously, i've had a ton of straighteners... from ones in this price range, to ones that cost hundreds of dollars:  you can't beat this.  Chi's are great until you plug it in one day (always magically a year after you buy it) and it doesn't heat up anymore.  (no, i don't mean doesn't get hot enough, i mean... ICE cold, the heat element shorts out or something).  This has a two year warranty, so they'll replace it!|`|cr44LMyhaa	The straightener i have works great and doesn't damage my hair at all. its called, Tourmaline Series and it is by jibere de paris. i got it at sally beaty supplies. I hope this helps!|`|9924978a027d4db9bf72b068fc058d30aa	A japanese straightening won't damage your hair but they're quite pricey due to the fact that it's labor intensive. Depending on your hair length, it can take up to eight hours! The great thing about it is that you'll have really straight hair until your hair grows out again. x3|`|2diobki7aa	Sedus or Chis are great. (: I have a Sedu, and I lovee it! <br>  No damage, and you can buy one on folica.com for about $115. It's a lot, but soo worth it!<br>  Also, if you want, try a Japanese hair straightening. Basically, it's a permanent hair straightening, and it doesn't usually damage hair very badly. Possibly a bit though :( It's expensive, and a loong process, but worth it!<br>  :D Good luck!
CENGvvu0aa	Look past a person's physical features and take a look into their heart. If you get em in bed the first night, they're yours forever. DON'T SCREW IT UP, MAN!!!!
Vmf4OE5haa	Yes you would look great if you also try that blond color along with highlighting in just the same way as that pic.<br>  You'll really look good.|`|1tYw97CRaa	yeah i think it would look fine.|`|iQMPw5eVaa	Yeah that's a cute style! I have a friend who's a brunette, her hair looks like that, it's really cute.
3oz4r6Nraa	I use Australian Gold Equatorial Thrust.  It was only like $20.  <br>  <br>  It's this stuff:<br>  <a href="http://www.worldclassnutrition.com/thrust.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldclassnutrition.com/thrus...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You shouldn't go every day, you WILL burn.  Go every other day TOPS, and every three days is better.  If you burn you will lose all the tanning you did AND you won't be able to go back until the burn fades.  Not only would it be extremely painful, but that's what kills your skin!  You need to build up a base tan.<br>  <br>  I went tanning for the first time, I did every other day like they said and I wound up getting burned!  Every three days is really best until your skin gets used to it.|`|zWo03iLNaa	DO NOT GO EVERY DAY! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE  You will burn to a crisp and then peel and it will be a waste of money. Go every 2 or 3 days. Every salon employee will tell you that.  You dont need any special lotion. You can even just buy an accelerator at walmart.|`|UOzSNEO8aa	designer skin bloom.  it has bronzers in it, but they do not stain your hands like a lot of other lotions with bronzers.  it also has stuff in it to protect your skin. - oh, but it may be over $40 dollars... but it's worth it.  it's the only stuff i use.
YQxxVdLNaa	Clothing: Pastels, neutrals, white<br>  <br>  Household items: Naturals (wood)|`|NRkmiftEaa	For clothing, lots of pastel colors are in season.Colors like baby blue and violet, or light pink. Lime greenish/yellow, spearmint, etc. You can see all of these colors on marc jacobs runways and diane von furstenberg runways.|`|bbYFPgCoaa	red is pretty popular right now, browns and other neutral colours are also popular,<br>  hope this helped. :)
zXtOCZIraa	Well try another colour, one more towards your liking if you like that colour you should go with it. But try adding things to make it look better: Bags, Rings, Belts, Hats and shoes even make up if you want.

rocQqDxYaa	i think emo girls can be gooooorgous . <br>  but its not really a look for just any1 .<br>  but cuttin yourself isnt emo . thats stupidity and crazy . emo is just a style . Like prep gangster goth and stuff<br>  <br>  are you emo ? i wanna see :D lol|`|nolxYfzUaa	I think they are people who could have a beautiful life, if they were willing to get some help.  I don't think they should be ignored or tossed aside, they are trapped in this field of emotion, thinking that the only attention they can ever get is by doing something harmful to themselves.  Not a good way to get my attention.  They, just like many need help.  No.  Not beautiful.  Sad and Sick.|`|qYJgB0Bsaa	I've seen beautiful emo's, usually they are beautiful people, but I guess people make suppositions that they harm themselves because they alienate themselves from others, and they usually are emotional about things and wear the darkest (mourning) colors on a daily basis. But I don't judge, who am I to judge|`|ZVoFUM28aa	Hmm i dont think 'emo' should be what you call them<br>  but people who follow the trend are amazing,<br>  i for one do.very strongly.<br>  and always get stopped and told how brave i am and how amazing it is that i do what i like and what i want to look like. <br>  not only on the outside.<br>  but emos are so deep.. theyre beautiful people:)<br>  x|`|7PMp6IrSaa	I agree with Mad Hatter.<br>  <br>  But when you say 'u can be an emo that r happy and fun and love the life.' I think thats the emo 'trend' the way they dress that just make people call them emo.<br>  But some people may look at it in the emotional sence.<br>  It's a hard question.|`|2OqVlUFdaa	I really have a thing for emo girls. I don't like emo  hair, but just dark hair and the necklace / wrist band stuff turns me on somehow.|`|h0wDABGbaa	yep i totally agree with you.<br>  they dont care what people think and theyre unique. and they dont dress the same as everyone else, their fashion has its own edge to them.|`|ymTvDaHQaa	i think thats RETARDED|`|tKHirMkvaa	Personally i don't like emos.

IN1oikSbaa	It's sore because you ARE cleaning it with chemicals that case scarring and more damage to the fresh wound. <br>  <br>  You're not using the correct cleaning method. Alcohol and peroxide both have the capability of causing more damage to the piercing than started. It slows the healing and it causes trauma to the wound, which is why it's so sore. <br>  <br>  You NEED to be using some sort of sea salt soak at least twice a day.<br>  <br>  H2Ocean. A solution to piercing problems. Tis love. I swear.<br>  <br>  Seriously. Alright. And another thing to look out for is over-cleaning. It may get irritated/dried out due to over cleansing; both outside and in. T H2Ocean is a nice 'refresher/moisture' spray that I use when mine starts to get a little fussy. Just a quick spray and it tends to calm down. I carry the little bottle along with me just for that reason. You can get it at most piercing parlors not to mention hot topic and sometimes Spencers.<br>  <br>  Also, when you're in the shower and cleaning it with soap, dontdontdont leave the soap on for anymore than 25 seconds. That'll irritate it a bit too.<br>  <br>  If you think it gets infected:<br>  Just soak your ear in a warm (not horridly HOT) sea salt soak for about 10 minutes twice a day. Make sure it's warm but not uncomfortably hot. The heat from the soak'll draw out all the bacteria and nasty gunk/puss, ect from your piercing and it'll slowly clean it out.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to soak twice a day for 5-10 minutes with a less salty solution than normal if you think it's infected. Be sure to use SEA SALT and not regular table salt.<br>  <br>  But here's a few other alternatives if you'd like to try these.<br>  <br>  Acceptable Healing Aids and Products<br>  <br>  * Tea Tree Oil - This soothing liquid cools and refreshes an irritated piercing. Use only high quality tea tree oil that has been diluted with distilled water.<br>  * Emu Oil - A universal healing product that has been discovered to also produce exceptional results when healing a piercing.<br>  * H2Ocean - Although some would call it "glorified saline solution," most do report excellent healing results with this product.<br>  * Saline Solution - Less expensive and more readily available than most other products, saline solution is very effective in soothing and healing a new piercing. It's also an acceptable substitute for sea salt soaks.<br>  <br>  Do NOT Use:<br>  <br>  * Hydrogen Peroxide - Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria, but it also kills the white blood cells attempting to heal your piercing. It can cause irritation and lengthen overall healing time.<br>  * Rubbing Alcohol - Alcohol will dry the skin and irritate the raw piercing, which could actually lead to infection.<br>  * Glyoxide - This is a product that contains hydrogen peroxide and hinders healing rather than aiding it.<br>  * Ear Care Solution - Solutions that are provided by jewelry boutiques and department store piercers usually contain alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and other harmful chemicals that only aggravate a new piercing.<br>  * Ointments - Antibacterial ointments or similar products only clog pores and/or kill good cells trying to heal the piercing.<br>  <br>  Using alcohol of any sort can horridly dry out the piercing and cause scarring.<br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your piercing! (=|`|C6jxKYu8aa	Actually, I think you are cleaning it too often. You are wiping away all of the healing that it is trying to do. Just put the antiseptic on it twice a day. Don't rub it in just let it drip on using a saturated cotton ball and turn twice. Yes, being sore for a week is normal. This is a sensitive area where there is cartilage. It will take some time before the soreness stops. Good luck, my friend.
fedceebc4c8708e7532d76e3ecf69613aa	A nose stud is never elegant.  Ever.<br>  <br>  If you want to pierce your nose, your look will be "edgy" or "conformist" or "punk" or "young".  If you're going for elegant, spend the money on something like a nice manicure.  And pick a polish that says "I have lovely hands", not "I have garish fingertips".|`|IwXy8KLVaa	Heyya! i want to get my nose and belly button pierced to :-). I think that sense you have got compliments on your nose that you should get your nose pierced. A monroe might look more edgy and not as classy.

When I got my nose done, it didn't really hurt at all, my eyes watered a little and it didn't get puffy or swell.  Once it's done you don't even know its been done.  It doesn't hurt or look bad at all.  I would go with the nose, monroes are a little more punkish as well.

Plushlash and Zoomlash are okay (I think Plushlash is better), but I doubt I'd buy either of them. Especially considering how often you're supposed to discard your mascara (2-3 times per year) doesn't really make the investment worthwhile. So unless you're really gonna cake it on every day, it's better to go with a Drugstore mascara, like Covergirl Lash Blast. 99% of the girls in the MAC ads are wearing false lashes anyway, so to me that doesn't say much for their mascara.<br>  <br>  As far as liners go, I'm a fluidline girl. It's way more versatile than liquid, and a LOT easier to apply. It's also a lot more buildable than pencil, although it does take a good brush (266, I believe?) and a little practice to get good at.

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There is a lot of stretch mark treatment available on the market these days. Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin. It has a bioactive topical formula that has a combination of skin firming agents to reduce visible wrinkles and make skin appear firmer<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|UH4lU7MEaa	this is effective method<br>  <br>  apply panthenol cream twice a day for 45 days , they will disappear<br>  <br>  you can find the panthenol cream in the drugstores and it is cheap here it is pic<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.makeup-uk.co.uk/Assets/SunCare/cream.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.makeup-uk.co.uk/Assets/SunCar...</a>|`|6mgqAxYSaa	Bio oil, let it soak in and then apply the palmers cocoa butter stuff.

You need to add 2 egg yolks and 4 table spoon of yoghurt and it should be like a cake batter and to achieve that add water after the yolk and yoghurt if necessary<br>  As for oil it can be coconut oil or almond oil or there is a 100% natural lotion It is lotion which is a natural formula made of essential oils such as coconut, olive, avocado and Aragon (from the Atlas Mountains) with extracts from fresh fruits, green plants including rose petals, cinnamon sticks.<br>  Oils and extracts of fruits and green plants penetrate rapidly through the scalp, providing rich and deep nourishment to hair follicles and it gets strengthened. It is Ziravie, I used to but it in Spain but it is available on ebay.co.uk and the ID is hair-treatment.<br>  After henna and shampoo do make sure you use a conditioner|`|vCtCW8ODaa	it smells bad, it takes ages to rinse away and if you leave it on too long your hair will go orange.. if you get it right and can stand the smell and all the rinsing then it can give you a good colour, it leaves your hair in good condition, you can buy it anywhere in england oh and its permanent so you can't remove it.  if you are using natural henna it's only really for dark hair and changes  it to auburn (deep red)|`|05SVYlXBaa	cheryl, don't do it! it is a metallic dye which means if you don't like the colour, you could never correct it. you cannot dye your hair again sweets. your hair would fall out if you did. <br>  <br>  You'd have to let your hair grow out before you ever dyed it again. plus it fades to an unattractive gingery red colour after a while which looks bright orange in certain lights. you're much better off using a boxed dye. just hide the colour bottles in a henna dye box. problem solved. <br>  <br>  Henna is great on skin but not hair|`|rqYy0RJVaa	The only colour henna does is reddy-orange.

rgNP0Qo6aa	You must always shave before treatments, it's a pain factor. Not shaving causes it to hurt a lot more, and not be any more effective. You need 6-8 treatments to get rid of the hair you have now, but you will grow in strays throughout your life, that's why you get touchup treatments every 5 years or so forever. here's my normal answer in case it helps you any<br>  <br>  Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!

1OjUQcJpaa	Hello, I'm a licensed hairdresser and I would say that it is perfectly fine to re-dye it...especially since you didn't bleach it.  In fact if you use a semi-permanent, ammonia-free, conditioning cream color your hair will feel softer and better than it does now.  It is a deposit only color so it will coat your hair and condition it, but it's not like it will just fade right off either.  It has a very natural look over the following weeks as you grow it out, and may begin to allow highlights from your golden blonde color show through (which looks so good) but it will NOT fade back to your golden blonde.  I do not know anything about grocery or beauty store brand hairdyes because I only go to cosmotology stores and buy professional brands...so I would recommend going to salon and getting it done.  Mainly because the products really are better for the overall health of your hair and you want your hair to be healthy for it to look, and shine the best it can.  <br>  <br>  For a WARM DARK BROWN I would use a Golden Dark Brown color...level 5-6.  (Level 5 is Brown, Level 6 is light brown...but semi permanents tend to be ashy and look one level darker than they say...this is why you will need to have half gold in the color to keep it warm). Any level darker might look blackish.  <br>  <br>  For a COOL DARK BROWN I would use a Nuetral Dark Brown color that has NO gold in it.  And I would use a level 6 or have hairdresser mix half 5 and 6 together, because like I said it tends to be ashy anyway and look one level darker.  (This is the color I have had on my hair for 5 years now, and it is phenomonally beautiful.  It is chocolatey rich, but not warm...and very shiny).<br>  <br>  I highly recommend Loreal brands as I have worked in very high end salons and they often use Loreal...but alot of salons that are not super expensive do too. Their best semi-permanent haircolor is called Richesse; if you end up using it you will be super happy...it is so shiny and conditioning and the color is ALWAYS gorgeous.<br>  <br>  Hope this advice helps...it's important to be super happy with your hair.|`|qFtBqFx0aa	If your hair was dyed lighter then it was bleached, regardless of how much lighter it was.     If the blonde isn't that light you could try dying at home maybe with just a semi permanent dye, I'd get a red toned brown because sometimes blonde hair goes a tad green/grey when you dye it brown. <br>  <br>   If you're in any doubt you'd be better just going to a hairdresser, once they've done the hard part of getting it brown you can always keep re-dying at home yourself.|`|gi0haHtdaa	hypocryte
2ZsRAxkuaa	Yeah.<br>  Although most are tattooed first, subdermals later. Its easier than way, and you don't have to worry about messing up the implant, and they can take quite a while to heal. Most people are impatient.<br>  But if you want a second or third generation implant, its probably better to go with the implant first, or if its gonna be a big tattoo.<br>  You'd have to rather gentle with tattooing them, and find an experienced artist, and I imgaine it would hurt more and feel rather bizarre.<br>  <br>  I can't be bothered to trawl through BME, <a href="http://news.bmezine.com/2009/03/05/3d-portrait-of-emilio-gonzalez/" rel="nofollow">http://news.bmezine.com/2009/03/05/3d-po...</a> I don't know which order that was done in though.<br>  <br>  There are quite a few pin up girl tattoos with 'enhancments'|`|ZkrGttKaaa	No pics, but as for doing the work, I don't forsee a problem. Probably already done it several times, and didn't know it. A lot of shops, (including ours) have female artists on staff, just for women who don't want some guy all over 'em. And did you know that some guys are sooo stupid.. (How stupid are they?!) ..that they'll pay almost twice what a man would charge, just to have a pretty young woman tattoo 'em? Seriously! Sonia makes out like a bandit! But hey, they get their moneys worth! She absolutely oozes charm. But, back to your question, the needle groups only penatrate 1/32" to 2/32" into the skin. Shouldn't be a problem at all.
QeoljgkBaa	Yes it is good.  The foundations are really good, I switched from Dior to Chanel and have never looked back.  The lip glosses are really nice, make your lips soft and most importantly they are not sticky, and do not go gooey around the top of the container which others do.|`|QGU7JAIUaa	I really like Chanel makeup ( But i adore MAC, sorry ) ive had their Mat lumiere foundation which i found was really long lasting and looked very natural, their holiday palette ( which had lip glosses,eye shadows, blushes and some brushes ) which i thought had really nice colours but it got mucked up easily ): and ive had their nail varnish in flamme rose which lasted forever and didn't chip plus it was a really nice colour. I would recommend those products if your just starting out getting into Chanel makeup as they're basic and are neutral colours. x|`|va8quhPtaa	It is for the show and seems good.|`|2S2onP86aa	Yes it is good. I like their eyeliner. I have tons of manicures from there too, love them. I just took a natural bronzer from there, it's a cream you apply it on your face and the bronze color slowly shows.

I took blusher too from there, etc.<br>  <br>  Chanel is always great. <br>  <br>  I like benefit too.|`|fVN9H9Rpaa	Yes, I'd say its one of the best.<br>  The only thing is that with the cleanser, toner and mosturiser, they must be perfumed since they irritated my skin, but everything else is fine.<br>  One of the best!|`|xrl0xTjTaa	not as good aas mac|`|G3tTFEqaaa	yeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyaaaaaaa
HgZo9GlFaa	really bright colours, im going to go out and buy some really bright green today!!! HOORAY!!|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	If you like to match your nail color to your outfit, it is better to go with a french manicure or american manicure, otherwise you will be doing your nails everyday. Just remember that your nails need a breather to stay in good condition, so leave your nail polish off for a few days each week and just rub petroleum jelly on your nails and cuticles will stay in good shape too. I put gloves on after putting on the petroleum jelly on my hands/nails, leave them on overnight, it makes my hands soft,nails conditioned and cuticles healthy.

One web site that has the skin tone seelction down is www.opi.com and using their web page "Try on This Color"  <a href="http://www.opi.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opi.com/</a> or 3) be bold and wear whichever color you love to wear that day no matter what anyone thinks.<br>  <br>  For skin tone and color selection one the "Try On This Color" has a virtual reality model's hand with a "horizontal bar" located on the bottom to mach your skin tone with six different selections (just move the indicator right or left to match your skin tone from light to dark) and a "vertical nail length" selector bar (located on the right hand side of the hand model) to match your nail length (just move the indicator up and down to shorten or lengthen the model's nails) along with a vast selection of lacquer colors which can be searched by tone and or collection on the far right hand side. <br>  <br>  If you move your mouse over the color dot it will display the color's name, just "Click" on a color dot and the virtual model's nails will change to that color shade for you to decide if that's the color you love to wear. <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I am sure you will find a color to match "your favorites"  and OPI nail lacquers are available from www.amazon.com or you can locate a store near you on their web site locator, 'Where to Buy."<br>  <br>  If you are near a mall and they have a Sephora Cosmtic Store you can also visit their Sephora by OPI nail product display. <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P217311&categoryId=C107" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  What I love about their display is they have sampler bottles of all their nail colors and nail polish remover and coton pads and encourage you to "try on" different color shades by wiping off the old polish and trying a new color shade. With 54 color hsades to choose from, and OPI making the product for Sephora it's a win-win situation. <br>  <br>  Just a suggestion, you may want to try out Sephora's "quick" nail polish drying drops <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P217306&categoryId=B70" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a> <br>  <br>  What this product does is use a eye dropper to place a drop of the liquid on each nail over your final color coat and drys the nail polish to the touch in one minute and seals all the coats of polish in five minutes time. No more smeared manicure colors from using a brush to apply the top coat if you use the drying drops first. You can always  apply your favorite top coat after using the nail polish drying drops as an added sealer and hardner. Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  My favorites for painting my toes?

cLU6nGWwaa	If you are going to an actress calling, wear something that expresses you, but is simple. I don't mean a costume, but anything that makes you feel confident.

X6wFMuu0aa	You may be developing an allergy to the metal used in inexpensive earrings.  Go to any place that sells earrings and ask for plastic ear protectors.  These are plastic sleeves that go over the posts on your earrings and plastic backs that replace the metal backs on your earrings so no metal touches your skin.  Follow the directions that come with the protectors.|`|30RlXHX3aa	I would say put the studs in for about 30 days straight.

7f6d435d56ad7cbfe4aed43f9d4134a5aa	You can contact Avon and let them know you would like to quit. That 7.50 is called an erepresentative. You can still sell Avon without that.

I like upper (side) lip piercings, but they only look good on certain people and I have no idea what you look like. So out of all the options, I think you should go for a tongue piercing. But that is something I'd never do, because I wouldn't be able to stand that kind of pain. I'd imagine tongue was more painful than any of the others you have listed.

kCdISEGqaa	Don't listen to Kermit J, he's not really an artist.  When the ink was available, it was very expensive.  And, no artist would hold on to ink that long, once opened, ink has a shelf life of about 18 months, then you risk bacteria/mold growth in the ink as it breaks down in the bottle.  If you ever find an artist who says they can do it, RUN, the ink is old and outdated.|`|H76IjEiPaa	They used to do it, but I'm not sure what happened. Your best luck is to call a tattoo shop and ask. They would know for sure.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	You betcha. My mentor, down at the shop, Steve, said... 'Yeah, they outlawed that glow in the dark stuff' in reference to the kind of pigment being banned.

They are particularly popular in the raver subculture.<br>  The tattoos can be completely invisible in normal light, although scarring from the tattoo machine in the application process may remain, and therefore still show. A UV tattoo becomes visible under blacklight, when it glows in colors ranging from white to purple, depending on the ink chosen. Colored ink is also available, where the ink is visible in normal light (as with a regular tattoo) but the ink will glow vividly under UV light. However, some UV inks are not as bright under normal light as normal tattoo ink and are considered not as vibrant.<br>  Arguments against UV tattoos<br>  <br>  UV tattoo ink is not commonly known or used, as very few varieties of UV inks are approved for use in the US. It is also many times more expensive than regular tattoo inks. Some people have had reactions to ingredients in the ink, ranging from minor itching to dermatitis. Several UV inks are suspected carcinogens and allergens and at this time, no research has been conducted into the possible side effects of long term exposure. Some UV inks are known to yellow or turn slightly brown with sun exposure.<br>  Many tattoo artists simply refuse to work with UV ink, because of the potential medical complications and the difficulty involved in the application process.[citation needed] In the past, many experts have advised against UV tattoos.<br>  <br>  <br>  you can find photos here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bmeink.com/uv001.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmeink.com/uv001.html</a>|`|FFsoiWe5aa	not that i know of, but there's ink that will show under a black light.

Works as well as my friend's $200 straightener, but I got mine for $30 at Marshalls.|`|34K0QIzTaa	i use chi! :) its really good and doesn't damage ur hair :)|`|NFn7G28laa	One of the best straighteners at the moment is ghd VI styler or ghd mk4-they're the same but have different names. They cost about ￡130 on the ghd website but half the price on ebay!!!(about 60 quid). When I straighten my hair with this it actually stays stick straight for 2 days!! So, if you want to get a straightener get a ghd VI or mk4 because they're honestly amazing!! ￡60 may seem expensive but it's worth it, mine were the cheapest ones on ebay but you just have to wait until you find some for that much. And they come in different colours as well: black,pink,white,purple.|`|95f7247eb624aa87ba4619aeec8608ccaa	iso international,  its a bit pricey but it works wonders!

(I bought mine for around thirty dollars.) It heats up in less than a minute, and it heats up to 400 degrees, which makes it super-easy to straighten your hair quickly and efficiently. Also, the one I purchased has small plates, so it's perfect for styling your hair if you have bangs or layers. <br>  <br>  Here's the one I bought:<br>  <a href="http://www.sallybeauty.com/flat-iron/SBS-255025,default,pd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallybeauty.com/flat-iron/SBS...</a><br>  <br>  I've had mine for over a year, and it sill works like new (even after dropping it countless times). :'D<br>  <br>  BedHead straighteners are even better, but they're a little more pricey. I've seen them at Target for around $70.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|n2cWT1Mpaa	Jhu Hij Hutj its from China and it was only $60 It works SOO well. You can take a shower, and dry your hair, then straighten it. The kewl thing is this:If you want your hair to be straightened the next day, you can still take a shower and your hair will be just as straight as it was the dya before, but it only lasts for 2 days.....no longer|`|pfskEpGhaa	I don't have one myself 'cause I'm waiting for mine to break but the GHD's are the best ones out there! Seriously...<br>  My hairdresser uses them on me and my friend has one and they work wonderful! It leaves your hair really smooth after and it doesn't give off that really bad smell afterward! They are also really good for curling hair as well.<br>  Highly recommend :)|`|EW2yML4Iaa	Mine is the: remington t/studio collection. It gets to 430F. It heats up very quickly. You can get the blades in like 2 different sizes. If you get this brand buy it at Target. It's the cheapest place to get it. With tax I paid $38. Kmart wants like $50 for it.|`|4gkPFS8waa	I have a bed head straightener. It heats up fast and straightens well except it doesn't keep your hair straight all day...<br>  So I'd rate it a 3.5/5|`|C0lpFqlHaa	Chi<br>  <br>  Its the best brand, i use it all the time :)
w32tsnheaa	LOOL, i remember, i did the same thing.. when i was like 13 i wanted layers, but was scared the hairdresser, was going to cut too much off, so i took matters into my own hands, and had a chunk of hair just below my ear. :) Nahh, it wont be embarrasing, hairdresser's probably deal with things like this all the time. It wont be a problem. <br>  Just say, you wanted to cut, a fringe.. And thought you'd give it a try.<br>  They'll probably just laugh it off. :)<br>  <br>  Hope, this helps.<br>  Good Luck.|`|uTIoOa62aa	wig?|`|goLJJ8Ruaa	you could try a bob they work long short and medium

Maybe you could try squats or something.|`|4CyXKudJaa	Lunges are really good for toning your whole lower body and gaining calf muscles. Your knees are fine, everybody has slightly darker knee's than the rest of their legs because the skin stretches tighter over your knee's and there isn't as much flesh there because of it, so you have nothing to worry about it that area. Your calf muscles are the hardest muscles on your body to enlarge, but like I said lunges are useful. If you don't know what lunges are, you can look it up on youtube. Jogging and cycling are also great for building your calf muscles. Even walking can help increase your muscles if you do enough of it. Good luck =)|`|oSMw5NFJaa	Your thighs are great and have muscles in them, so the same thing you did for your thighs, do for your legs. You're absolutely fine though the way you are.

mbhAPC2naa	Wash it with Head & Shoulders Dandruff, but thats the only way I know.|`|PwxmrBm9aa	I will echo what one person said, the head scarf, hat or head bands.<br>  In case you didn't know dandruff is caused by a dry scalp, massaging coconut oil into your scalp is a really effective way of getting rid of dandruff. Head and shoulders is a well known shampoo treatment for dandruff, although it does dry out hair & strips the colour from hair. Make sure your shampoo is sulfate free, has lots of natural extracts, vitamins & protein. Buy according to your needs, for you buy a shampoo for a dry scalp. Washing your hair everyday can also dry out the scalp causing dandruff.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|CtjNURKiaa	wear a headband scarf kinda thing or a hat.

Its extremely hard to tell the difference, the only difference is that these mascaras cost soo much less.|`|DFo4KXB0aa	Eh my sister bought the stuff and i tryed it, But i wasnt impressed, it wasnt anything to be that wowed about, Im a person who has a pretty large mascara collection but you can most likely get the Collasssal lash by maybeline and its the same thing almost, its not worth about 25 or 28$ you can defintly by somthing better for half the cost.|`|8484b98b7322a891688e78db30e42f20aa	I've tried the Diorshow mascara before and I honestly didn't much like it. It easily smudged in my case and wouldn't last nearly as long as I wanted it to. The mascara I use now (and which I have been using for a year or so now) is the Artistry essentials mascara. I've found it SO much better than all the mascaras I've tried before, as it as an amazing brush and lasts a pretty long time, so I hardly ever have to reapply within a given day. And it doesn't smudge! (always a plus in my book :D).<br>  <br>  And it's also cheaper than most other quality (not drug store) mascaras. I usually but it directly off their website (pasted below) since it's considerably cheaper than from a store.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, mate! ^_^|`|66482ddb3e8238c3f38495575c668c1baa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfovhfeCcSc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfovhfeCc...</a><br>  <br>  in this video michelle talks about the comparisons of diorshow to drugstore brands. she's basically the best makeup guru on youtube.<br>  <br>  you really can find things better than sephora. i've bought multiple mascaras from there and i recently bought neutrogenas lash tint & loreals telescopic and there sooo much better than the ones i spent $30 dollars on at sephora.<br>  oops.<br>  but if you're into dior and love name brands as i do, go ahead and splurge if you want it.|`|rQx8RTwwaa	I had it and it was ok (not award winning).

They just do it as a joke, for a dare, to make people laugh, to see what it feels, etc...  But that does NOT make him a crossdresser.<br>  <br>  Your typical crossdresser is a guy who gets pleasure from wearing girl's clothes.  He will say it gives him a sense of well-being, pleasure, sexual gratification or self identity from doing it.  It makes him so happy, that he will say he loves it.  However, he can't stop.  Its like an addiction.<br>  <br>  The vast majority of guys who wear girls clothes don't feel anything but embarrassment.|`|N6t1q65xaa	why not? he just wants to know how it feels like to wear heels,maybe just curiosity.Its totally weird though.|`|l6yn08LNaa	lol if he wants to but thats kinda gay|`|Gf8Hi4Pbaa	Yeah sure why not?It's his life.|`|py5aBJVzaa	Sure, why not let him wear a pair of your heels.

The sparklies are far too common these days. Go for something tight fitting on the bodess with a little lace on the shoulders or even on the chest...use a similar bodess style to what ashley was wearing except in a blue or black or red without a pattern on. Then cover the revealed chest area with some lace. you can cover the entire bodess with lace if you want. Have it fit snugly through till your hips. then have it go a little more flared and ballroom/latin styled till a little above the knee. <br>  Hope you like it!|`|vIenrLvqaa	I think its gorgeous, the only problem with dresses like that is that your arms cant be too fat or else you will look pregnant.

For me, ankles and wrists are the nicest and least-trashiest places for tattoos.<br>  ;)|`|CtSIr1OZaa	No, I don't think that people will think it's trashy at all. <br>  I think it sounds cute. Typically, people think it's trashy <br>  when girls get tattoos on their lower back, hence the <br>  nickname "tramp stamp". If I were you, I wouldn't be worried<br>  about what people think about it, if it's what you want then do it.<br>  I don't think you'll have a problem with people's opinions though.|`|0lWB2SUwaa	I don't think so<br>  <br>  If you get one that is somewhere on your waist/pant line then I think its trashy|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Why don't you henna instead, perhaps after it wears off you will change your mind and not get a tattoo. People do judge others by their tattoos, even a heart or something else innocent is symbolic, you never know who will judge you for it down the road.|`|jL0Y27g2aa	I feel as though getting a tattoo should really think about this decision, im sure you have but this will be on your body for the rest of your life, if you are questioning this decision i would hold off for a bit. Also, i think a tattoo should mean something semtimental|`|NNx8PZncaa	the only people that would think it's trashy are very narrow minded ones, who cares what they think! as long as you've given it alot of thought and you're 100% sure about what you want and where you want it you should go for it x x|`|La9bMNQqaa	No, little tattoos are cute, not trashy. It's all about placement and what it is. Yours sounds fine. Don't worry about what other people think anyways.|`|8Initt1aaa	no, they will see you as every other cliche girl who gets a trail of stars tattoo. not original. been done too many times.
gN1PQbsmaa	You mentioned you recently wore leggings under a top, so is that because you're not fully comfortable showing all your legs?<br>  At this time of the year I always keep my legs covered when I go out, so I usually wear tights or something like that. You could wear a dress or shorts with tights, or the other night I wore some really high socks, like knee high, and a dress. That's always a cute combination. <br>  Knee high socks are quite big right now, so Topshop and New Look should have a selection.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  x|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	What kind of a party is it -- thats what way you should dress.<br>  <br>  Nothing wrong in going with a dress and heels.|`|lhrMI9f5aa	Wear a dress and heels :)|`|82c2ilpEaa	I was living in Uk for a time, and maybe is better if you chosse a dress in  a beautiful green (dark green) color, or red...you should look gorgeous if you make your dress in a simple way, and a little of makeup...moreover chose a dress that you can then use for summer...or spring ;)<br>   the question is also..how old are you darling? coz depending of your age you can use one or another<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mercadolibre.cl/jm/img?s=MLC&f=9173350_4853.jpg&v=P" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercadolibre.cl/jm/img?s=MLC&...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tamagotchiydisney.unlugar.com/disney/Vestido_rojo_fiesta_minnie.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tamagotchiydisney.unlugar.com...</a><br>  <a href="http://blogs.elcomercio.com.pe/lavaplatos/Vestido%2Bverde%5B1%5D.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.elcomercio.com.pe/lavaplato...</a><br>  <br>  you can buy a dress in these colours coz they look really gorgeous with a black coat, and boots ;)<br>  have a good time|`|b3GZB3Wyaa	Sailor Shorts<br>      Long Vest Top<br>      Fitted Waistocat<br>      Chunky Heels<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>         x|`|PBQA8tJ0aa	go naked BUT 1st send the link of the pic in additional details pls thanks so much hoped i helped (not really)

asxE8gCAaa	if you straighten your hair take your straightener and straighten your bangs as if to make them hang straight down in front of your face then sweep them to the side it gives them that little something extra<br>  <br>  but after straightening them take a rounded brush and brush them into a little bump|`|nObgLVkraa	It's alot easier if you want rounded edges if you have a straightener. Just pull them under like you would with a round brush...hold for 2-4 seconds and you're good!! :))|`|pgUfi7XMaa	ya..i don't think you can do that by urself -- def need a stylist<br>  but to get close: when you can try: when you comb you hair or straighten it, bring the comb from underneath.. to add volume... but other than that, sorry, but i don't think you can get that close ...<br>  but, go to ur stylist (if you have one) and get advice...<br>  <br>  :)|`|z2TjjnxVaa	That's because she's blow dried them.....with a round brush.<br>  <br>  People always underestimate a good blow dryer.

lgM3xZkWaa	Uuummm..that's a total shocker!!Who the heck would wear it?!?!?!!?I mean it's pink WITH A LOT OF FRILLS!Like tori:) said that they got guts to wear that!It would be funny if at prom someone came in in that dress and thought they were all that!Haha!|`|OuOOy8v3aa	I honestly don't think any one would buy that and then wear it out somewhere.<br>  It is hideous.<br>  I love the top bit, but people need to learn, less is more.<br>  <br>  Nuala :<br>  Get some back bone!<br>  If you're even being serious, which i doubt you are, then grow up. If you spent $1600 on a dress don't buy a new one just because a few people on yahoo said it was horrid.|`|KXmMlqA9aa	Well whoever wears that has some nerve! I personally didn't think it was as bad as you said it was. You shouldn''t be so hard on that person for wearing that. At least they have the guts. I don't really mind the dress.|`|vD4Le4mKaa	that is sooooooooooo nice<br>  <br>  <br>  and the girl is pretty!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  it costs a lot of money thoguh!!|`|TxcukvlTaa	though i don't particularly like the dress i would go as far as calling it hideous.  And at the end of the day if you have the confience to wear it it will look good b'cos its down to the person not the dress.  Though i think the colour doesnt help it. <br>  kate xxx|`|NhGXC5e4aa	this dress might have a lot of frills but i think this dress would be wat ya call high fashion, i think its nice, i wouldn't personally wear it, but it would be nice in a fashion parade with all that fancy make up!!!|`|CC4hwzZxaa	emm thanx i bought this dress for prom like 2 weeks ago and i really like it so thankyou for calling it hideouse i appreciate it im gonna go and buy a new dress now thankyou xox|`|gN1PQbsmaa	Horrible!<br>  The colour, the ruffles, it's all too much.<br>  She looks like a big Barbie doll, and not in a good way.|`|UFvn0kZ2aa	I have to agree with Tori on this one....|`|MwvA8v17aa	haha!<br>  whoever wears that in public has got some nerve.|`|4yHAsSLVaa	Yes it is not very nice to look at but I like the top bit.<br>  I don't know where anyone would wear it!
asxE8gCAaa	white would be a good color or maybe yellow... i would go with a light color or something bright that would stand out against your skin|`|FklngtvCaa	Light pink, light yellow, bright red, bright white, or beige.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	Bright colours! You have the best skin tone for it...you're already wearing one of the best colours fo ryou.<br>  <br>  That Blue is great. I would also do like royal purples...bright poppy reds. You look great in colour! Don't wear anything too muted it will wash you out. Although a very light gray wouldn't do that.|`|WDnpaCe1aa	Colors that are not dark such as black and brown. As a woman of color the skin tends to absorb the color. Yellow and Red seem to look nice on you. :)|`|rj5KWEtcaa	you could probably get away with any bright colours, im thinking yellow, turquoise, bright green,pink anything like that especially as its coming up to summer.|`|KkVUPatCaa	A bright,sunny shade of yellow or orange :)<br>  <br>   Also grey looks good on everyone.|`|pPBcGrRgaa	i say that u should weat light colors such as pink, yellow and white. Tr yto avoid  colors such as navy.. The best about white clothes is that you can match with any other color and look very good. Try a shirt with stripes too it would look very nice|`|XUw1PDW6aa	wear brighter colors like yellow or pink, its really gonna bring out your natural glow, goodluck
l2foFWFjaa	Very politely (that's IMPORTANT) ask her why she doesn't want you to dye your hair. Consider her reasoning. Then proceed to explain that you don't want to dye your hair purple or make any drastic changes like that, you just want to make it a little darker and have a little bit of a richer color. I'm 15 and my mom allowed me to dye my hair when I explained this to her. Best of luck!|`|66482ddb3e8238c3f38495575c668c1baa	I'm 17, started dying it when I was 12. I regret it entirely. I dyed it monthly until I was 15. Then I started highlighting.<br>  <br>  The sad thing about dying your hair and highlighting is that it REALLY kills your hair. Your hair will start to get thin and gross and ratty.<br>  Mines on the verge and it's probably going to fall out if I don't stop.<br>  Ha. <br>  SO I regret it. Your mom is right.|`|K119R72Caa	Your mom has a point. Dying your hair can be bad. It can damage it bad. Also say your blonde and want to dye your hair brown, it can come out green!! at your age dying isn't the way to go. At your mom;'s age (which come on she's your mother it isn't your business if she dyes her hair) Her hair can take it. Wait till your like 16 or something|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	well if you know how, do it at a friends house, cause I dont think you have to be 16, 18 or 21 or over a certin age to buy hair dye|`|a8XOrp8maa	What about if you would use a natural herbal dye like Henna? It still dyes the hair but because its natural it has no chemicals so there wouldn't be any health safety reason not to let you...|`|Zx23ZXgGaa	try wash out dye that will last week or so. that way if you or your mom doesn't like it, its not permanent.|`|T864ejaiaa	your young and you can mess your head up. my 13 year old just asked me if she could dye her hair for birthday. she has sandy blond hair and wants to dye it brown. oh please. keep the beautiful color you have. talk to a hair specialist and ask what you can do or use to bring out the natural beauty of it. good luck.|`|2404nDvSaa	tell her it looks like a groundhogs but...|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	ask her if you can low light your hair. <br>  Or just say going darker is healthier than going lighter (like highlights). It is true.<br>  Or tell her you just want to dye it a little darker to make your skin look better and bring out your eyes|`|3Hf3YtyKaa	Your mom is right<br>  Im 28 and I dyed my hair for the first time at your age and now I have to constantly dye it|`|0fygxRHLaa	tell her it doesn't match the carpet|`|PuMsIIL6aa	Um... just beg
92fyzJkcaa	bout 30 mostly depends on the earring and if its sterling slilver or not u know..|`|M1TgnTR6aa	hes right .dont get it done with a gun.and claires is overpriced for piercings.go to a tattoo parlor and have it done with a needle.it will be cheaper and turn out much much better!xox?|`|ybDrwqFbaa	it depends on what earring you want to buy and thats all you have to pay.. Mine didnt hurt aT all I DIdnt even feel it im not kidding.. and i got mine done with a gun|`|g7AymvvAaa	probably 20 bucks @ the most. but be careful... it hurts|`|rHKW1CJJaa	dont pierce you carlidge with a gun. ahhh its not worth it it will never stop hurting and you are gunna eventually get fed up and take it out.get it done with a needle so you dont shatter any cartlidge etc
mIoUXqP2aa	I like Neutrogena best; Nivea tends to make my skin feel clogged up etc. Neutrogena really clears up my skin, as does Clean and Clear if you want a different one.|`|AA11707096	Nivea can be heavy and greasy, Neutrogena is a mild product line made for young oily skin.|`|47E10snbaa	from personal experience neutrogena, definitely.|`|OAHHe1mxaa	At the moment I am using Clearasil, which is really good. I tend to change the product I use every so often because you can become immune to the effects of them. The Clearasil Ultra pads are excellent and so is the wash. If you have lots of spots that you want to get rid of but won't go away with the products you use, you can get tablets from your doctor that will clear up your skin, I have some that you have to take one every day, you still have to clean your skin every morning and night, but your doctor will explain about medical stuff if you need any. But yeah, Clearasil, Johnsons, Witch, Olay, Neutrogena and Nivea are all really good, it depends on what works for you!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|qHcEBN2Zaa	Hmm...neutrogena is alot better. But there's no guarantee that it will work on your skin. Try the natural stuff. Grated potato is very good for relieving the skin of oiliness and clogged pores. Once every 2 days. This worked for me when neutrogena didn't. It's worked for my entire family before me too. It's got a 99% chance to work for you.|`|lMu2J3pNaa	definitely neutrogena|`|MWEPNhqkaa	Neutrogena is definitely the best bet. it is recommended by dermatologists.|`|DlPFJur2aa	out of your three, neutrogena. I used it once... but proactiv worked the best from my personal experiences

VPAMzE3uaa	If they are already scars, this information might be a little late for you.  But have you considered honey?  Raw (unheated) honey works best, produces anti-bacterial properties, and promotes cell regeneration.  It works best on fresh wounds and allows them to heal without scarring.<br>  <br>  Once you have scarred, your skin has learned to re-grown in that (scarred) way.  I don't know if honey will reverse this.  Medicinal use of honey and honeybee-related products is called Apitherapy.  Look around on the web (there's lots of information) for others who've tried this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
Kz6Dmv2Oaa	Because it is the period in our lives where we are too old to be forced by our parents to get it cut, and too young to get a job, when the employer will usually tell us to get it cut aswell.|`|mbhAPC2naa	They do it because as children their parents wouldn't let them grow their hair that long. Also because some people might be emo (emotional) and that is the style for emos.|`|xRXZCMSGaa	Most parents don't allow it when they're little. It takes away from their "innocence". And I guess it's just mostly a fashion trend for teenage guys.|`|KkVUPatCaa	That's the skater look,most of them are cute:)<br>  <br>   Don't let it grow out too long,though. That just looks like you need a haircut:P|`|jHyDO7rcaa	They think they look cool and impress their friends and the girls XD|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	its a fashion trend..<br>  <br>  but more importantly, they are trying to show the world that they are in-charge of their lives..

Sometimes its really cute and other times icky.|`|Zx23ZXgGaa	because they are mistaken for a girl from behind, and its gives a dirty and unkept appearance.|`|71wF3u8qaa	because it usually looks disgusting. very few guys can work long hair.
mIoUXqP2aa	You can still tan when you're wearing sunlotion, definitely. Don't ever wear a low factor just to tan because it will damage your skin-always wear the appropriate one for your skin tone.<br>  <br>  Burn might turn into tan depending on your skin tone, but don't use that as an excuse for not wearing sunlotion because it is so damaging to your skin and you will get a much more even (and less painful) tan by sunbathing with the right factor on.|`|m7Y10ojiaa	Burns can turn into tans (depending on your skin tone) but you should still wear a sunscreen.. you can still get a bit tan using sunscreen.|`|vkhQz16Laa	Yes you can still get a little tan from sunlotion. i suggest you get suntan lotion though. it keeps your skin from getting burnt and it helps you become tan. you can just buy at Walmart. Just wear somewhat kind of sunlotion because you dont want to get skin cancer or any other kind of disease.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope i helped!<br>  ;D|`|OtDPZO3vaa	2) Burns don't turn to tans.<br>  <br>  1) Sun "lotions"...a.k.a. Sun BLOCKS have a factor number. <br>  4, 15, 30..and that's marked on the bottle. What that means<br>  is the length of time you can be in the sun before getting the same exposure as having no sunblock on. If you use a 4, you can stay out 4 times longer than WITHOUT lotion and get the same results...whether that's a tan or a burn. Then higher the number, the longer it will take to get a tan. The first time out in the sun during a season, you should use a higher number if you want to tan. You want a tan to come slowly...not trying to cook yourself in the first day.<br>  If you plan on being out for an hour, you can use a number like 10 or 15. If you're going to be at an amusement park and pretty much in the sun all day, go higher, perhaps a 30.<br>  <br>  Here's a great hint...if you have a tendency to burn, or even if you don't but MIGHT, get some Lipton tea bags, the regular cheap ones at the store. Put one on a glass of water before you go sunning. You can use a used cup (washed out) from a fast food place since you don't really want to use GLASS" If you get back and are burnt, get in the shower and take the tea in with you. Put the tea on the sore, burnt spots and let it set there for a minute. Take a mild-temp shower to wash the tea off. The tea will take the sting out almost instantly!|`|1HDvbLdWaa	wear sun screen when you tan!!!!!!!!<br>  yes you still tan but you just wont get burnt.<br>  for some people burns turn into tans,<br>  i get tan, and then burn, and then peel at the spots i got burned and those spots turn white!<br>  and even if your burns do turn to tans its horribleee for your skin|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	yea u can.<br>  they can or cant depends on person.|`|fyBWY8Cmaa	Burns can turn into tans but sunlotion block Uv rays so you cant get a tan :S <br>  Hope I helped<br>  <br>  By the way can you help me with my question <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AknqAco5UPgHKQ24Gy5WceTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307042801AAE85Yz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
mp5Vg7Peaa	Personally i'd ditch the dream matte mousse as i was told by a professional make up artist that is one of the worst foundations for your skin as its packed full of skin harming ingridients and i know loads of you are gonna say that youve had no problems with it, but you cant tell the damage its doing in the long run..<br>  <br>  Have your skin looked at by a consultant and they will be able to tell you your perfect shade of foundation and texture :)|`|rHKW1CJJaa	sounds like you have the wrong color. it should blend, any patchiness is an indication that is the wrong shade. you are using nude and golden sands? 2 very diff. shades.good luck!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	i think you must have combination skin, so the foundation shows up the different oily and dry patches. i have just bought clinique's almost powder mineral foundation and it went on very nicely. try a mineral foundation powder.|`|rqYy0RJVaa	Have u tried their exfoliator?

N7I1NT6Maa	You're not supposed to take the out for a while, silly!  Umm.. Honestly, I'd just shove them back in if they've only been out for an hour or so.. take a piece of ice and put it behind your earlobe (I'm assuming this is a lobe piercing) and try to get the earring back in the front. It should be fine...  Good luck, don't take them out again for a month or so!|`|rpwjkuvmaa	Has it closed over? How long did you leave it out for?<br>  If i were you i'd leave it out, let it heal over (if it hasn't already) and go get it repierced later on. But like the first guy said you should have waited longer to change them sorry :(|`|KiGnomhZaa	silly billy!! You have to wait a least 6 weeks before you can take the first earrings out.
4PdTxuxgaa	uhm ones i can think of are that<br>   - you can't stand one of your friends<br>   - you like a guy but you won't tell anyone because that guy could be either out of your league or your friend's boyfriend<br>   - you have a boyfriend and don't tell your parents<br>   - think a guy is really hot while you already have a boyfriend|`|RNi6gytSaa	- He's amazingly hot! (looks at a guy in the mall)<br>  - You are friends with this girl u absolutely hate and you wanna punch her. <br>  - You look the same guy your best friend likes. <br>  <br>  Those are common :)|`|028908623891a267dc96205ad9202b6aaa	Well, none of my secrets/thoughts really have to do with thinking someone is hot lol.. What exactly do you want to know? How girls think? How they think all the time, or in certain social surroundings?|`|XAIurFZnaa	I'm a girl, and here are some pretty common secrets:<br>  <br>  -You secretly hate one of your friends<br>  -You have a crush on ur friend's boyfriend<br>  -That new teacher is pretty hot (lol! idk)<br>  -He is sooo cute, but no one can know i like him?<br>  <br>  Ummm idk those r pretty basic secrets and thoughts girls have but i cant speak for every girl soo yeahh. :]|`|1HDvbLdWaa	it depends,<br>  every girl is different and it depends on their age.<br>  for me secrets are:<br>  <br>  -certain things ive done that i really shouldnt have.<br>  -hiding that you've had sex from your parents. HAH!<br>  -getting really annoyed by your friends.<br>  -not being able to stand your best friends.<br>  <br>  i mean theres a bunch of things, its hard to break down the girls mind|`|EXWpMIZJaa	~ ooh i like him! (staring at a hot guy)<br>  <br>  ~ ugh i dont wanna do my homework<br>  <br>  ~ i dont like katty anymore just tell her to BACK off!<br>  <br>  lots of things were either thinking about guys or hating some of our mean friends! lol thats how our life is|`|ZQlW9Oeiaa	- Secretly don't like a friend.<br>  - Date secretly.<br>  - Like the same guy as your best friend.<br>  - Gossiping a Hell of a lot (some girls).<br>  - Secretly like a guy but wouldn't tell a soul.<br>  <br>  Those are usually the most common.
EAdhYJymaa	same here. Bermudas. That's what im wearing. mine are pink and white striped!|`|dBj1GurBaa	I defintily know that kind of weather! i live in MA. I would wear capri shorts. its a good mid point. enjoy the weather!! it'll be 60 here today so i know i will be!|`|1JmxcjFjaa	If it were me, I'd wear pants. But you could get away with capris or bermuda shorts...probably nothing too much shorter..|`|rHKW1CJJaa	omg YA its too cold. its 70 in florida right now and im freezing, lol|`|ZtGThw01aa	I say, " Wear whatever makes you comfortable.." the weather changes where I live so much. One day it 72` and the next single digits, snowing, so i guess its all up to the person. I more than likely would not wear shorts, unless I was doing yard work at home, at a friends, or around the house. But if I was going out to a mall etc... more than likely not...later on in the day, it may get cooler. I am not sure what time of the day you're wanting to wear shorts, but keep that in consideration too...It would be nice change for a little spring/summer clothes..:)|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	Well yesterday at my school it was the first warm day and it was 58. A lot of girls wore short shorts to school. It was kind of fun only because it was cold all week and it was a day to just be happy.|`|NBi07o6zaa	Lucky! I'm in NH, it's like 30 here. But warming up. :]<br>  <br>  I wouldn't wear short short, but capri shorts or Burmuda shorts would be fine...people around here are wearing short shorts and it's colder than where you live.|`|cQvE4orcaa	i ouwld wear like a pair of bermuda shorts and like a pair of flip flops and a t-shirtt|`|QzfHwGOQaa	It is too early! Wait till it is 70-75 F and then consider some shorts.
xcvuJfKMaa	Perhaps you are not using a cream with enough moisturizer to keep your skin soft while you shave.  Never dry shave.  Also, you need some aloe or an astringent when you complete your shaving.  And experiment with what is the right direction for you to shave.|`|IKOsBOIyaa	, it means your face isn't moisturized, and it makes a rashy thingy when you shave... try face lotion.|`|uTIoOa62aa	u don use cream
FlzU20bLaa	Either scratch it off and put some cover-up on the spot if it is red/bleeding, or just leave it alone. If you pick them too much, it can leave scars, but if you do it once or twice for certain occasions, it shouldn't hurt.|`|unj06qooaa	scratch it off :)<br>  painful somtimes but works....<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArVyWygiwVw0l4d6B2zJXgXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307070407AA4f73v">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  plzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzpl... help me

Gew6pZhbaa	I've never tried MAC cosmetics, but as a fan of the website www.makeupalley.com, I've read through a lot of reviews on Bare Minerals, and many people compare it to L'Oreal Bare Naturale loose powder mineral foundation. I've tried L'Oreal myself and it works wonders. I have a lot of acne scars and redness in my cheeks and Bare Naturale covers and evens out every imperfection. It lasts all through a long work day without fading, and it doesn't smudge off on clothes. Even in natural sunlight my skin looks flawless. For around $11.00 at Walmart, this stuff is like a miracle.|`|66482ddb3e8238c3f38495575c668c1baa	Go to the MAC Counter. Mineralize foundation & primers are usually the best to work with though.<br>  Smashbox products work really really nice. But I've been using them for over a year now so I'm a little biased. <br>  <br>  Haha, happy shoppping.|`|yWoK9ryJaa	As a professional makeup artist I highly recommend a totally different product because of the most amazing light and flawless coverage. <br>  <br>  Bee Luscious Cosmetics Liquid Minerals.<br>  MAC tends to be a heavier product that what you are used to wearing.<br>  <br>  Also the bee luscious brand is hypo allergenic and has SPF 15 the bare minerals I am not a fan because of the high content of bismuth oxychloried that is harmful to the skins health and well being as it is a derivitive of arsenic lead that occurs in the soil. It does clog pores overall and in many instances can cause itching and irritation.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beeluscious.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.beeluscious.com</a><br>  <br>  Here is a review on some of the products offered by this company as ref.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12ycA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12y...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPv_POaTTZ8&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPv_POaTT...</a>|`|tANzRJ4daa	I currently use MAC and I am not happy with their foundation. My mom tells me I look beautiful but for some reason I just don't like it. Today I'm going to try Chanel, Dior, and Laura Mercier foundations.<br>  <br>  It's good to spend a few extra bucks for much better quality.

p2iLuTyVaa	show make-up usually means thick studio stuff, and bright eye make-up, because when your on a stage and lights are on you, you actually NEED makeup to be seen, and to not look as pale as a ghost<br>  <br>  you should try a studio foundation (MAC do a good one), blusher, lots of mascara and eyeliner, and bright eyeshadow. if you put foundation on your eyelids first, the eyeshadow will stay on longer<br>  x|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	dark lipstick.<br>  pink or brown eyeshadow<br>  mascara<br>  eyeliner<br>  loose powder|`|eXbGpOAfaa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Apply-Makeup-on-Yourself-for-a-Show" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Apply-Makeup-on-Y...</a>|`|Y1NdPfEYaa	lots of blush and eyeshadow and sparkles and lip gloss/stick

W3bELVbmaa	No, as this has wheat in it can only make your acne better actually :)<br>  I had acne for years when I was younger and its gone now, but I was given a list by my dr of the foods which make it worse and foods which help it - anything with wheat in was on the list for making it better :)<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  take care hun :)<br>  x|`|TRGAOMsoaa	the only way to find out is to replace it with different foods for a couple of weeks. cos it might be a acne-causer for some...others not - different skins yano.<br>  :-)<br>  personally i find drinking at least 2L of water has helped my skin dramatically.|`|tnoyKjJ1aa	if its very sugary it could be thats how your body is reacting..<br>  <br>  stop eating it and see if that makes a difference|`|VRI9zTeraa	I don't think so. Foods that make your acne worse would be sugar, dairy products (maybe the milk in your cereal?), and refined carbs like white bread and white pastas.

jezA7yqtaa	Thats defenitely a cute outfit but i dont think you should wear that for a roller skate party. You should go like for a 70's look. Maybe hust wear some hottpink leggings, and maybe if u want wear some demin short jeans ontop of them. A purple or lime green tanktop. And a cute hoodie.<br>  Wear bright colors!<br>  Also wear a colorful head band u can find it at claires.com<br>  For clothes and leggings go to wetseal.com|`|MweuoRWBaa	The hoodie and tank link don't work, like the pacsun jeans better|`|NBi07o6zaa	The first jeans are so cute! Other links don't work...<br>  <br>  Wear some Converse to finish it off.|`|R37e00HEaa	well the first two links dont work but out of the two jeans i i like the second one better.|`|EAdhYJymaa	dark jeans.|`|JSX38xTkaa	the abercrombie pages dont work<br>  as for the jeans, i like the pacsun ones better|`|p3GZERIsaa	no.
OAHHe1mxaa	Different shades of green, blue, gray, and silver. If you are going to a party, a thing line of silver liner would look really cool, or if you're just going out shopping or something, blues, greys and greens look good, with a grey liner along the bottom rim and some black mascara. Just make sure you keep it subtle, not over the top or too dark!|`|p2iLuTyVaa	hey, i have green/blue/gray eyes too! :) ive never known anyone else to have this combination except me and my siblings<br>  anyway.. these colour eyes can pretty much get away with anything, but the best are browns, earthy colours, purples, and shades of green.|`|qHcEBN2Zaa	usually darker colors. dark eyeliner and a dark sexy dress and maybe dark brown or black hair. works very well. makes your eyes really pop out.|`|yWoK9ryJaa	Golds and browns for blue and green purples but you can get away with just about anything.<br>  <br>  Here is a beautiful I look I found on youtube for a brown smokey eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12ycA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12y...</a><br>  <br>  I have used this brand in the reviews gorgeous products.
jdV5o8NMaa	My sis has two in each ear( I have a few peircings).  She said it hurt but its a quick sharp pain, she told me its was tender for a few days but thats was about it   So I think it would be less painful because it is an expected pain unlike a fall off a bike.  As for crying I doubt it with most my piercings the anticipation was worst then the pain and my eyes watered a bit,  but they water easily.    As for cleaning do not touch them a lot except to turn them and only with clean hands, never use peroxide use bactine.  Her biggest problem was keeping her hair out of the posts so she had to wear hers back at first,  but she liked to show them off so it worked out well.  Sleeping my take some getting use to but use a soft small blanket to out on top of your pillow to cushion it till it is not tender as for the ear pick the side of your face that looks best with hair off it!|`|x1A0hkSNaa	Ok, so i'm not too sure on the pain but maybe you should watch this video<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfPM-esijWg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfPM-esij...</a><br>  My guess would be that it's painful depending on how much numbing spray goes on?<br>  Sleep on the opposite side to where you get your piercing, just in case.
R4Ij1u0Baa	Yes.. Me 2..|`|bqLXc0Fmaa	coloring what, you have to say what your coloring or something.|`|Y2ZH2kayaa	i've been wanting to color my hair light brown but highlights are enough for me. ;p|`|pzeHxEl9aa	thats nice :D|`|JSX38xTkaa	i want to color my hair!!!!|`|eIWhpSt0aa	thats great... :)
MiPUPjV2aa	mac mineralize eye shadow duos are great as they last a long time and are made up of lots of colors. i think engaging would look good with green eyes<br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/products/sp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT15782&PRODUCT_ID=PROD90199" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/templates/...</a>|`|uIjPLPcVaa	gold, my sister has green eyes, and she always wheres gold eyeshadow with brown in the crease to school. she always compliments, lol kinda drives me crazy! she only uses M.A.C products, but you can try the annabelle eyeshadow in gold dreams, (drugstore brand) i have that and its really nice. try it out!:)|`|qYTYcVGGaa	soft metallic brown shades would heighten blue AND green at the same time|`|KKrRLC7Naa	Try A Light Gold colour, it'd go really well with green! I have bluey green eyes and wear gold all the time and get llots of compliment hehe. <br>  I use benefit, but also N07 are good :)<br>  Hope this helps
aQIXj6bVaa	It's better if you just buy the palette. They have their most populat colors sold in a purple palette called the Urban Decay Deluxe and it's well worth it. An indiviudal shadow is expensive enough. You'd save more buying the palette and you'd have all the colors you could need.|`|Xb6sf3oKaa	wow i never noticed how great the urban decay line is!<br>  well for girls with hazelish eyes you want a purple (done) or a silvery blue look. <br>  I loved the colors:<br>  Shattered<br>  Goddess<br>  Vapor<br>  Uzi<br>  Midnight Cowgirl<br>  Maui Wowie<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! remember that with the extremely bright colors, use them as accents around your eyes so it doesnt look like ur a barbie :)|`|i1rFHgSDaa	I'd definitely go for oil slick! I totally adore this colour, i already have it in a palet from urban decay! If your too unsure, check out too faced products aswell, they do a really nice range :)<br>  <br>  x|`|mp5Vg7Peaa	Shattered, Gun metal and Midnight cowboy :)|`|5RBE08BWaa	Midnight Cowboy Rides Again :)|`|fyBWY8Cmaa	Midnight Cowboy Rides Again <br>  <br>  shattered|`|gIrn6cC2aa	Sin or Shattered <br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  i'd go for shattered|`|rzm1ZDovaa	i think strip, half baked and polyester bride are the best for your eyes...|`|5i6HYDpeaa	cherry/ grind<br>  elderado<br>  green goddess<br>  speed<br>  vapor<br>  <br>  those would look good|`|gab4fOrUaa	gunmental or mary jane :)<br>  they would really suit the colours in ur eyes!<br>  x|`|oG1CqWgmaa	oil slick<br>  <br>  i have it its the best eye shadow ive ever had, i use it everyday. if you dampen a eyeliner brush and dip it in the shadow, it also makes a liner, so its a shadow liner thing. 2 in one, my kinda product :)|`|BFPPVq7Saa	mildew|`|ildgJVJoaa	omg i love urban decay eyeshadow - it's the only stuff i use! i personally like the palets (SP?), because you can really experiment with them, and they really do last. you could also experiment at the store, because they have testers and stuff. if you were going to buy them singally, i would get either brown, black, blue, or green (green goddess, flipside, oil slick, or smog)|`|mIoUXqP2aa	Green Goddess, Gunmetal, Sin, Shattered or Midnight Cowboy Rides Again. My personal favourite is Gunmetal, and my eyes sound pretty similar to yours.|`|47E10snbaa	gunmental<br>  i love the sparkly silver eyeshadows|`|yUyx2nhmaa	mildew and chopper
qHcEBN2Zaa	Hmm...is it a very dark burn mark?<br>  Since you've had it for years, it would take a while to get rid off. If it's darker than the rest of your skin, then try mixing sandalwood powder with tumeric powder and some almond oil. This worked for some of my marks. I have a very patchy face too. Since the chickenpox when I was a thrid grader. Im in the 8th grade right now. It helps quite a bit on recent marks. It takes a few months or more of constant use to get rid of long term marks. But this will work. It will dye it slightly orange for a while if you have light skin but not permanently. Use it for about 3 hours each day. DO NOT USE SOAP OR FACE WASH WHEN WASHING IT OFF! really, that won't help anything! just leave it like that until morning, then you can wash your face. Re apply when you come home from school and rinse off before bed. Ull be fine in no time hon.<br>  <br>  And you really shouldn't worry. I have already had a really good boyfriend and I have quite a few VERY good friends. I also have someone obsessed with me cuz they think im pretty! If you have a nice face shape and just believe you can do it, you will. i mean, i GAINED weight and he still loves me. <br>  <br>  wow this was a long reply|`|AMRNqIAaaa	have a sit-down convorsation with you mom.<br>  if it helps, before you ask her to talk about it, write down some important points that you have on why it's embarrassing and why you'd like it gone,<br>  and then firmly explain to her that this is what's bothering you and if you could shop for some concealer, nothing more, that you would be extremely grateful.<br>  <br>  also, ask her to take you to the doctors for some ideas.|`|LXNo9ROaaa	Wow. Stop. Gain some self confidence. You really should cry on a daily basis over a mark on your cheek. Nobody really cares that you have a mark on your cheek, you're just paranoid. Deal with it.|`|mIoUXqP2aa	I know it's mainly for stretch marks, but I had the same kind of thing and I used Bio-Oil which seemed to work. Also, go to your chemist (drugstore, do you guys call it?) and ask them to recommend something for you there. <br>  <br>  If these don't work, ask your mom to reconsider letting you wear cover up. Ask to talk to her, and tell her how much it is upsetting you and how you understand she has doubts about you wearing make up but you really feel self conscious about it. Don't get mad, just say you understand if she won't let you but you would feel a lot more comfortable with it on.<br>  <br>  Finally, if none of this works, and even if it does, try and accept it as part of you. It may not seem it now, but it's probably nowhere near as bad as you think, and you might actually feel like it's part of you someday. Just because people look there, it doesn't mean it's really noticeable or bad, people's eyes just tend to drift to the tiniest thing. Talk to your best friends about it as well, and tell them how it makes you feel self conscious. I bet they'll be able to make you feel better about it, and probably don't think it's bad at all.|`|1kivE8DIaa	Getting rid of your acne and other related skin diseases may involve some simple changes in your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  What you eat could have a big influence on your skin conditions.

I haven't tried it personally but its supposed to be effective, ill put the link in the sources box below. Cant you by a concealer and put it on at school and take face wipes so you can take it off before you get home. Or you could plead with your mum to try and make her understand how bad you feel and your need to cover it up, maybe if you tell her how you feel she'll understand. Its not like you want to pile make-up on, just a little bit of concealer. And anyway, people probably ain't looking where you think they are, maybe your just paranoid about the mark and think they are. People will judge you on your personality, not your appearance so don't keep downing yourself thinking they will :( <br>  <br>  X|`|4CyXKudJaa	Try Bio Oil. It is used to help the appearance of scars, stretch marks and uneven skin tone, as well as aging skin and dehydrated skin. It's good and has great reviews and it helped reduce the appearance of my stretch marks... and if it helped that, it'll probably help reduce the appearance of your scar too (It sounds like a scar to me). You'll probably only need the smaller bottle because you're not covering a huge area like with my stretch marks, so buy a 60ml bottle which is about ￡5-6 from Boots (Or maybe a pharmacy or drug store). Or you can buy it from the website for &6.66:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bio-oil-direct.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio-oil-direct.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  They say you need to use it everyday for about 6 weeks before you see an improvement, but I saw improvement way before that =)|`|47E10snbaa	i wouldn't listen to my mom!<br>  just put on cover up lol if she says anything then tell her that you're going to wear it because you have a second head growing (I wouldn't think of that when I see someone like that, but it'd be a perfect thing to tell her lol)

After that i would comb your bangs across your eye and secure with 2 black bobby pins or cute clip. Then to make it have more volume on the sides and back get a fine tooth comb and some hairspray and start teasing <br>  I hope this helps :-)|`|p2iLuTyVaa	why are you trying to be emo?<br>  just be yourself and have your hair however you like it<br>  <br>  why do people go around asking how to look like a stereotype?!|`|ZQlW9Oeiaa	You can always get side bangs or part your hair so it covers your eyes, if you use hairspray it should stay in place =P.

M1TgnTR6aa	Navel Piercing<br>  Your navel has been pierced by a professional body piercer and pierced using an implantation steel captive bead ring of the highest quality available. The rest of the healing process is up to you. Following this simple guide should enable you to have a great piercing that when healed will look great now and for years to come. Remember one thing no matter how good your piercing may appear over the next 3 to 6 months (12 to 18 weeks) it’s not healed and care must be exercised in handling it. Your piercing will not be seasoned (toughened) until you reach 1 year from the date of the piercing , so damage from changing jewellery or wearing inappropriate jewellery in the piercing is still possible within that time period.<br>  <br>  New Piercing Aftercare<br>  <br>  1) Clean your navel piercing twice a day for the next 3 days, once in the morning and again at night. You can do this in the shower or bath but you must always rinse the piercing out using fresh running water.<br>  <br>  1a) Shampoo, Conditioner, Soap-up and Rinse off using your normal bath products. We don’t want any other cleaning or grooming products to enter a piercing we are trying to clean. Leave cleaning your navel piercing as the last thing you clean before exiting the shower or bath.<br>  <br>  1b) Using your Soft Soap brand liquid anti-bacterial soap apply a small amount to your hand and lather it up. Once lathered, apply this to the navel piercing and jewellery, working it into the piercing by rotating the ring. Once the Soft Soap is in the piercing wait a few moments then rinse the piercing in running water again rotating the ring to ensure all the soap is out of the navel and piercing.<br>  <br>  1c) Come out of the shower or bath and towel dry, but use a tissue to dry the navel piercing inside and out thoroughly (towels can retain bacteria and should not be used on new or fresh piercings)<br>  <br>  After 3 Days<br>  <br>  Follow the above steps 1a through 1c only once a day for the next three to four weeks. Between actual cleanings you may rotate the ring only under running water after you have soaped up and rinsed off and don’t intend on using any other cleaning or grooming products.<br>  <br>  After 4 Weeks<br>  <br>  Follow the above steps 1a through 1c only once every 2 or 3 days for the next three to four months. Over cleaning is the number one cause of irritated navel piercings, striping the natural skin oils will tend to dry the navel piercing out causing it to look red and irritated.<br>  <br>  Things Not to Do with New Navel Piercings.<br>  <br>  Do Not use Epsom Salts, Table Salt, Betadine, Tea Tree Oil, Polysporin, Neosporin, Bacitracin, Bactroban, Bactine or any other topical solution or ointment on your piercing what so ever. These products are not for use on Puncture Wounds! If it’s not listed on the above aftercare guide don’t use it on the piercing!.<br>  <br>  Do Not use Sun Block, Sun Tan Lotion, Baby Oil or any other skin care product on a new or unseasoned piercing.<br>  <br>  If you think you have trouble with your piercing contact your piercer and NEVER remove the jewellery from a suspected infected piercing.
7lNWUIiPaa	My absolute favorite from this collection is TIPPY blush. It's such a pretty pink color and it stays on your face for a long time.<br>  <br>  I also have the Mimmy HK Lipglass.

rFMRgHTdaa	i think the hip will be fine just make sure its not too close to your stomach because if it is then it will stretch.|`|qHcEBN2Zaa	Here's what you do. Buy some tatoo pens and draw a fake tatoo somewhere on your body. Keep it there for about 4 months and see how you like it. If you don't, try it somewhere else for a few months. If you end up not liking it anywhere, don't get one. If you can live with it for more than 6 months, go ahead and get a real one.<br>  It's better to try it and be able to remove it than put one on permanently so soon that you don't like it.<br>  Hope this helps you :)|`|AA10029323	Not a good idea.<br>  <br>  You may think it is cool now.... but you WILL get tired of it and just to let you know.... nobody really cares.

OXOHoISraa	Honestly, you might try to use something like wrecking balm to lighten them, or if you are unhappy with how they came out, find someone better who can fix them. There is laser removal, but it is expensive, painful, and scarring. It will leave your skin slightly discolored and a strange texture, and it is your face. Also, the area that is lasered will not tan the same as the rest of your skin, and even if you don't tan we all get some pigment in our skin from uv rays.|`|IcYXQlf9aa	there is laser tattoo removal, but it doesn't work completely on some people, and can cause scarring on others- consult someone board-certified for best, safest results|`|dae34b4ef56cf9f9a9c29d363b3c4bc8aa	Laser is generally the choice method of all tattooing, but this depends on what really is the problem.  Many times the eyebrows are tattooed on too dark and just need to be lightened by tattooing in a salt water solution and then when healed, using a better color.  If they are newly tattooed it takes a couple weeks to lighten up.<br>  <br>  If you have a shape issue, this is more involved.|`|FFsoiWe5aa	did you try a eraser, maybe a big one.
ZkrGttKaaa	Well, they've been a fad ever since a popular men's magazine did a write up on 'em, and they are a real pain in the @$$. You have to get the skin to 'hold' the white pigment. Thick skin usually holds twice as good as thin skin. Light complected people got a chance, dark complected, sometimes yes, sometimes not yes. And sometimes you have to hammer 'em in for four sittings to get it to hold. It CAN be a hassle. Now everybody wants one, I tell 'em sure! It's gonna cost ya! (Oh, yes, they do fade to a yellowish color, if not maintained.) To keep the white both showing and brilliant, requires touch ups.) Oh yeah, the tan doesn't have to be fake, to screw it up. Fake tan stuff WILL, definitely.|`|HvbIE03saa	It depends on the quality of the ink and the abilities of the artist.<br>  <br>  White inks generally fade pretty easily, but if you really want it, you can just get it touched up every now and then.<br>  <br>  If you use a spray on tan, that might cover the tattoo, but if you fake and bake or sun tan then it actually enhances the visibility of the tattoo and can make it look very cool.<br>  <br>  I have a friend that has bands of flames around her biceps (she's a firefighter) in white ink and in the winter when she's pale, you can't even tell they're there, but in the summer when she's tan, they stand out a lot and look really cool.|`|0lWB2SUwaa	I think they look like some skin disease in regular light<br>  <br>  Of course, under a dark light they look cool|`|UYnZtJ2daa	I've had no problem with my white tattoo. It looked white the day I got it almost two years ago and it still looks white. But I am a very pale person and it's on my ribs so it very rarely comes in contact with the sun. Unless you're pale, it's probably not going to show up completely white. And I don't know why someone said people are going to charge you more to do white tattoos. I have a small one and it was only $80...but I don't think he'd do free touch ups if I had needed them. It only took one time of tattooing the area for it to be white.<br>  <br>  How visible they are just depends on your skin and your body.

UtaNIzQUaa	The reason they say that is for infection control. You can never be sure if the people who maintain the pool are doing it correctly, and an infection on your tragus could be really bad. If you are practice swimming at the school pool, they generally have way too much chlorine - which kills germs -so you're probably ok. But the other part to that is chlorine can be very irritating to the skin - so make sure you've put a triple antibiotic ointment on it before to protect it and that you clean it well after to rinse off the chlorine - pick up bottle of sterile water at the drug store and then use the triple antibiotic ointment on it. Be religious about it, because any piercing that goes through cartilage always takes longer to heal, and an infection will be harder to get rid of.|`|IROLLdMIaa	i guess|`|vGrYHJCMaa	I'm a competitive swimmer also.

TfJn3KJvaa	Fish, eggs, Yogurt, oatmeal, and plenty of water to name a few.<br>  <br>  Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try and include a few of these food in your diet to make your hair grow fast.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|Vrr6jz47aa	A slight lift might help a little with your confidence, but I don't think it'll make too much of a difference in the way that people view/treat you.<br>  <br>  It sounds like what you need is some confidence and attitude - easier said than done, I know.  It might help to find some other shorter guys to hang out with.  I have the opposite problem.  I'm a tall woman and although I do think it helps in the work force, I've had more than a few internet dates where the guy says 'oh wow.  you really ARE tall' with obvious disdain.  Long story short, I started meeting up with a tall people group, and the sense of camaraderie I've found, when I meet other taller women is wonderful.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.  I know it must be hard.  Just remember, attitude is everything.  And keep in mind that Napoleon, Genghis Khan, and Yassir Arafat were all about your height.  And people definitely took them seriously!|`|ECJsO9J0aa	yes may be you can go to this web to have a look <br>  <a href="http://www.etopstores.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.etopstores.com/</a>|`|REotVciZaa	you might in fact be taken less seriously with high heels on.<br>  <br>  ABORT!!!|`|A9MDoFooaa	no no no - do not get high heels - spend the money on a course to bolster your confidence - your height is your excuse, be honest with yourself and be kinder to yourself.<br>  <br>  its all about positive attitude - try finding some good affirmations that resonate with you and read them every day to remind yourself how powerful you are - <br>  i will start you off with this...<br>  Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate,<br>  but that we are powerful beyond measure.<br>  It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us.<br>  <br>  We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant,<br>  gorgeous, handsome, talented and fabulous?<br>  Actually, who are you not to be?<br>  You are a child of God.<br>  <br>  Your playing small does not serve the world.<br>  There is nothing enlightened about shrinking<br>  so that other people won't feel insecure around you.<br>  <br>  We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us.<br>  It is not just in some; it is in everyone.<br>  And, as we let our own light shine,<br>  we consciously give other people permission to do the same.<br>  <br>  As we are liberated from our fear,<br>  our presence automatically liberates others.<br>  <br>  by marriane williamson

jeCvLt9saa	just put a smile and your face and be nice<br>  you're 13 you don't need makeup|`|nidCgr73aa	Don't listen to anyone who says you're too young for make-up, I started with make-up when I was about twelve, I sometimes looked like a clown but I have experience with make-up now and that never happens anymore. I just turned fourteen in January by the way.<br>  <br>  A quite natural look is "in".<br>  <br>  I suggest maybe a tinted moisturiser of a foundation to stop you getting as much spots (spots are already bad enough when you're a teenager) and use no concealer just now.<br>  <br>  Apply your tinted moisturiser (I recommend Nivea Visage Young Be Beautiful Tinted Moisturiser) on a cleansed, toned and moisturised face. You can buy cleansing wipes with toner in them for around a pound in chemists and I use Simple Rich Daily Moisturiser afterwards.<br>  <br>  Take a pressed powder now to keep your base (the tinted moisturiser) on and to get rid of any shine on your face. I use Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder and I thoroughly recommend it! Apply all over your face focusing on your nose, forehead and chin (the more oily places).<br>  <br>  Then a bronzer is pretty when not put on in excess. I use a bronzer that I got as a gift and it is Barry M Dazzle Compact I think. It was around nine pound fifty, it's a bit expensive though. Try to get a cheaper bronzer that isn't orange-y, try them in make-up shops etc and get a more browny one but not too dark. Just a medium brown colour.<br>  <br>  Apply the bronzer to your forehead, nose and make fish lips (like pout your lips so much you get dimples - hopefully you understand what I mean) then apply underneath the dimples/cheekbones.<br>  <br>  Blush is next. This may seem like a lot but unless you cake it on it looks pretty and natural. Maybe try a pinkier blush to start with for a more natural look but to be honest I use a orange-y pink one. Just find one you like on, do not use bronzer on your cheeks are blush though.<br>  <br>  You will need eyelash curlers too. They are between one and three pound. You don't need dead expensive ones and they last for ages. Carefully curl your top eyelashes and watch you don't nip your eyelid as it can be slightly painful and make your eyes water.<br>  <br>  Now mascara. A everyday thing, every girl needs! In my opinion. I really recommend Maybelline's new Colossal mascara, it's in a thick yellow and purple tube. It's the best I've ever used. Maybe ask a female relative how to put mascara on nicely because it's hard to explain in words.<br>  <br>  Add a clear/light pink lip balm or lip gloss and you're ready to go.<br>  <br>  Make sure all your make-up's blended in and try to do it in a natural light (like near the window during the day etc).<br>  <br>  Any more question e-mail me through Yahoo - morgan_crawford@yahoo.co.uk<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|iOW2aLeGaa	ok im 13 to.<br>  <br>  I just wear foundation when needed, mascara, lipgloss and sometimes blush(when i go shopping or somewere)<br>  natural looks better, just put 1 or 2 layers of mascara and a small coat of lipgloss.

Next buy a eyelash curler if you haven't already and curl your lashes ￡1.99 . Apply a shaping mascara try rimmel londons sexy curves mascara ￡5.99 for the bottom coat, then for the top coat miss sporty's Studio lash (the lime green one) ￡2.99 for the top coat, once you have done this either put on bronzer or blusher on to both cheeks. And there you have it, an any occasion makeup look. <br>  I hope this helped, DR.FASHION.|`|c4IMbLFIaa	If your'e going out to the mall or something, keep it casual, like powder or foundation, then maybe a little blush on and some lip gloss, not too much though, too shiny doesn't look nice.<br>  If you're going to parties or anything like that...  Some foundation again. Lip gloss, or lip stick. Blush. :)<br>  Check out Demi Lovato's make- up in her photoshoots. They're not bad. HAHA. Light but still classy.<br>  Keep it simple. Don't overdo it or anything. You're only 13, natural beauty looks best, HAHA. And besides, if you wear too much make- up every single day of your lives, that's not gonna do ANY good for your skin when you grow older.

4CyXKudJaa	Well I can help you with the uneven skin tone =) It's called Bio Oil and it helps clear up uneven skin tone. It is made from natural ingredients, so it shouldn't harm your skin. Bio oil also helps with dry skin. Its ￡6.66 from the bio oil website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bio-oil-direct.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio-oil-direct.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  Or you can get it from Boots or some other pharmacy or drug store. You should only need the 60ml bottle, but make sure you use it everyday and then you should see improvement within weeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the blackheads, try clearasil daily blackhead scrub, but I can't think of any quick solution to get rid of them I'm afraid. Maybe you could ask for some acne pills from your doctor for them. Maybe it's not blackheads, but something else, so go ask your doctor about them anyway. Are you sure it's not just hair that hasn't grown far enough out of your skin yet?? Because if that's the case then just wash your legs in really cold water to close up the pores a little... other than that I don't know how to help with that problem. Good luck =)|`|SQekGM8gaa	I have never heard of that. . .sorry|`|g15tHbCCaa	um...eew.|`|sFASHCNRaa	i've NEVER heard of blackheads on legs...ok first off i'd see a dermatologist cause maybe its something odd with your hormones (which would be affecting your skin) and he could prescribe you something to help your skin.<br>  <br>  but in the meantime, go to cvs and get neutrogena clean and clear blackhead cleanser. works on my face so i'd try it on your legs in the meantime<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|rUjUmXNjaa	try some of that neutrogena body wash<br>  Neutrogena cosmetics enhance your natural beauty and improve your skin's appearance.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	exfoliate , and get a comedone extractor .|`|jCkLYey7aa	Panoxyl 5% cream or Panoxyl gel 10% would be what I reccommend Its what the Doctors prescribe you can buy it in  pharmacists or ebay.

If you did, then you are amongst many people on a daily basis who aspire to get a celebrity style. The fact is that the more trendy styles whether it is clothing or hairstyles are brought upon by celebrities. Most of the top designers and hairstylist will use celebrities to showcase new trendy hairstyles to advertise their services.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-|`|Zx23ZXgGaa	well it looks pretty emo to me. But you could tease your hair a bit (make it bigger) then spray it with hair spray. FYI you  shouldn't try to be something you arn't - especially emo of all things.

EmRuVzBGaa	1. Prep your skin with any primer. <br>  2. Since her skin is nice, pale, and glowey. I suggest applying a illuminating product before your foundation and after your primer. Brands like Stilla and Smashbox sell these kind's of products.<br>  3. Apply Foundation<br>  4. Choose a really trasnlucent and netural eyeshadow for the eyes.<br>  5. Eyeliner is key here, stick with black, (I suggest liquid eyeliner) and apply it on the upper lash line.<br>  6. Put several coats of Black mascara.<br>  7. If you want lipstick, apply a lip scrub or moisturizer, put on red eyeliner, and apply the lipstick.<br>  8. If you want lipgloss, apply lip scrub or moisturizer, put on nude lip liner and put on chapstick. Then apply the gloss.|`|EL45UeUJaa	1. Apply lotion or toner to a clean face<br>  2. Apply a light concealer below and around your eyes to hide bags, also apply to any red spots or problem areas you have on your face.<br>  3. Apply a foundation all over<br>  4. Add a powder to help set the make up.<br>  5. Add a little big darker powder, and along cheekbones to define them.<br>  6. Suck in your cheeks (like if you were doing a fish face :) ) and apply a rosy colored blush lightly to the depresssed areas.<br>  7. Use a espresso (dark brown) colored eyeliner, i would say liquid, and your upper eyelids and on your inner upper waterline to define it.<br>  8. apply black mascara to your top eyelashes (2 or 3 coats) and to your lower eyelashes ( 1 or 2 coats)<br>  9. Also if you want add a white powder to the top of your cheekbones so that the light will hit them nicely.

9UgGwvtlaa	DONT MATCH MAKEUP TO THE CLOTHES.<br>  do it the way you want to do it.<br>  Makeup enhances ur already beautiful feature(wide eyes,full lips,nice skin,etc)<br>  <br>  DONT let someone pressure u to do something u dont want to do.<br>  I for example..I love dramtic eyes, as u can see the youtube dramtic tuorials. I love the smoky greens and smoky grays and browns.<br>  Never be afraid of color.<br>  Every makeup artist agrees that there are no rules in makeup..there are only rules of thumb.<br>  so do something fun but still you.<br>  <br>  you should make your eyes the main focal point for prom...with perfect flawless skin and a nice pinkish nude lip..FOR EXAMPLE<br>  <br>  or u can do the classic red lip<br>  <br>  whatever u choose im sure it would look nice|`|VRI9zTeraa	I like the glamorous look like the perfect skin look with a glow and eyes a bit more dramatic than the lips.

For a full coverage bra, it would be at least 3 to 4 hooks and for a demi bra, it would be 2-3. hooks.|`|NqWl2qlPaa	Considering the size, I'd say you would need at least four if not five.  You need extra support when they're that big.  I'm a 38 C and some of mine have 4 hooks.|`|TwPrP32Paa	3 hooks
6h7Fl1exaa	Green Eyeshadow <br>  <br>  Pink Lip Gloss /really white its cute<br>  <br>  Use Smooth Mineral Blush and earthy blues or greens to let ur eyes apper even more<br>  <br>  Use Blue or green eyeliner|`|66482ddb3e8238c3f38495575c668c1baa	Definitely use a light golden eyeliner, try almay's color line for blue eyes. I use it, it's gorgeous and looks more natural but still noticeable. if you want the more natural look use a brown/black lash tint or thin mascara. if you want your mascara to be dramatic use a basic black lengthening mascara. a light pink eyeshadow looks great with some flecks of gold or silver. but make sure your eyes don't look irritated with the pink.<br>  hope this helps.

If u want trendy and stylish dresses, buy them from Newlook, debenhams or H&M- they r surely the best shops to buy clothes from!!

Because I doubt that you'll be wearing the clothes that vouge models wear. Right now some stores that are very popular are; hollister, AE and  Abercrombie & Fitch.  So there you can look around, find some things that you like.

jfsBX6kJaa	Yes and No if it's natural, then No. If you did it then yes,then it may look weird.|`|rHZivjUGaa	NO.  I have naturaly brown hair with black eyebrows and it looks awesome....as long as the black is a natural black, NOTHING looks better and more unique than black eyebrows.  I love my black eyebrows and never want to change the color because I know they are unique.  I inherited it from the Jewish heritage of black eyebrows, I think.  Now, don't get a hair color that is too warm or too light brown.  If your base color is lighter than medium brown it can start to get weird.  What suits it best is medium brown hair, like mine (its natural color) that is NOT warm and something that pops the color out amazing is a medium cool brown and also looks good with GOLDEN blonde highlights!<br>  <br>  When I was younger I had like reddish brown hair and  reddish brown eyebrow color.  It developed into medium cool brown with black eyebrows.  My hair is lighter brown now at 31 than it was as 21, so it lightens as I get older.  My black eyebrows stay the same.

GPIEuHRcaa	To achieve the smoky eyes look is really easy. all you have to do is:<br>  1.Apply eyeliner to the top and bottom of your eyes, a thin line on both is best.<br>  2.Cover the top of your eyelid with a grey, shimmery eye shadow.<br>  3.Use an eyeshadow brush to make a thin line of black eyeshadow on your lower eyelid.<br>  4. Use slighty smudge the whole look out a bit, when it is dry.<br>  5.Apply mascara or fake eyelashes.<br>  I hope this helped, and have a great time tonight!<br>  DR.FASHION.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCnJ8B0Ay14" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCnJ8B0Ay...</a>|`|Dug6yDOLaa	eye liner:<br>  <br>  when you put eye liner on smudge it with the eraser end so it isn't really dark and goth looking<br>  <br>  eye shadow:<br>  <br>  take a tissue and gently rub the shadow around a bit, it will rub some off, creating a smoky effect<br>  <br>  mascara:<br>  <br>  put on the top and bottom lashes to emphasize the smoke and eye liner look|`|lTxeGDfgaa	Try a little light liner for a better effect, or you could use black eyeshadow AS eyeliner on the top lid, meaning just a very very thin ine above the lashes, then do gray, could be any shade of gray, if you have more than one, just do the one that looks best with your skin tone and eyes, and put that one the rest of your lid, but you could also mix together the black and the gray.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|d09f570877bcea55a8ab8640d6b86637aa	there you go<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPwabfAmCGQ&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=FF9091ADAC7BEC1B&playnext=1&index=11" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPwabfAmC...</a><br>  <br>  just type in on youtube , smokey eyes<br>  <br>  loads come up<br>  i just prefer this girl<br>  <br>  have a nice night<br>  xx|`|yWoK9ryJaa	Here is a simple and goroeous brown smokey eye I have used this same quad with various of my clients and it is amazing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12ycA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12y...</a>|`|EmRuVzBGaa	1. Prime your eyes. You don't want the eyeshadow to settle into your creases, so apply a base or a priming product onto your eyelids. If you have oily lids, make sure to get a primer that has "oil-free" on it. Some popular high end eyelid primers are Too Face Shadow Insurance, Urban Decay's Primer Potion, and all the MAC Paint pots and paints. Some drugstore primers are Revlon Eyeshadow Quads and Loreal Creaseless Primer. <br>  <br>  2. Apply Eyeliner first on the top lid on the last line. Use black eye liner. When you fraw, start at the beginning of your eye (where it's closet to the nose) and draw a thin line, and countinsly getting bigger. At the end of the eye, it should be thicker and larger than the beginning of the eye. <br>  <br>  3. Time to start your eyeshadow. Grab a netural toned or white, shimmerly eye shadow and apply it from the beginning of your eye to your brow bone. This provides another base for perfect application. <br>  <br>  4. Using a darker eye shadow shade, blend it into the first eyeshadow, but make sure not to apply it over the crease. Make sure to blend it very well so you don't see a noticiably line, this is what creates the "smokey" effect"<br>  <br>  5. Apply Mascara. Curl lashes, if you prime your eyelashes, do so, and apply about 2 coats of volumizing mascara. <br>  <br>  You should be done! Here are some more websites and video's if I didn't provide you the clear instructions of doing a smokey eye: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://beauty.about.com/od/allaboutyoureyes/ht/smokeyes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.about.com/od/allaboutyoure...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.about.com/beauty/How-to-Make-a-Smokey-Eye.htm" rel="nofollow">http://video.about.com/beauty/How-to-Mak...</a>|`|nUJGOUsbaa	PERSONALLY!!<br>  i dont think you should do smoky eyes!<br>  i think that eye liner on the top and bottom of the eyes and mascara would make your eyes stand out much more<br>  i wear a lot of heavy eye make up and whenever i go out with less on my friends always seem to prefer it!<br>  if you still wanna do smokey eyes I would suggest it my way<br>  i use liquid eyeliner pencil eye liner mascara and black eye shadow.<br>  1) put pencil eyeliner on the bottom of eye<br>  2) thin or thick line of liquid eyeliner on the top. i used to put a very thick layer of eyeliner on the top of my eyes and with a makeup wipe remove some untill it got to the shape i wanted it. <br>  3) eyeshadow on top of eye above the eyeliner<br>  4) mascara!!!<br>  5) if you want i sometimes put eyeshadow in the inner corner of my eye but sometimes it looks tooo much!!<br>  <br>  have a good night :) <br>  Amy <3|`|v49P5D1Paa	Take a wet angled brush and dip it into some dark gray shadow and sweep it in short strokes right at or above your lash line. Then use a small brush and sweep it across the crease of your eye.<br>  or To get my eyes smoky looking, I apply a pencil eyeliner close to my lashes and smudge with a Q-tip.

9mKunwmMaa	You so could be a model. You are really pretty. To find out stuff on modeling just look on Youtube.com<br>  <br>  Hope I helped<br>  <br>  Please answer my questions :)
NqWl2qlPaa	I totally agree with you on that one.  I can't imagine putting my pic up and asking the world how I look.  You know some people are rude as hell, and you are gonna just lower your self-esteem by putting yourself out there like that.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	I totally agree. I am so tired of people, no matter whether they are teens or not, who have the shallowness and lack of confidence,to post their pictures and ask perfect strangers for their "opinion". It is a joke, Don't these people have friends and family to ask? The funniest ones and most ridiculous are the ones that post "glamour" or "photoshopped" pictures of themselves...and when they get negative comments about having no self-esteem, they accuse the person of being jealous. You got to laugh, really. Yes, there is so much more to life than having other people think you are attractive, brains, thoughtfulness and regard for your fellow human being, far surpass it. The ones who  do post their pictures and ask "Am I pretty?", will read these comments and obviously give us all a "thumbs down", too  I guess that is what makes the world go round.....|`|n54Z9nWXaa	so true.|`|eISzHe5maa	Reason is because our outside apperances is the first impression we see and we might use that to tell what type of person she is. Is she lazy, sloppy, easy, etc. We all do it and I don't want to hear a single person tell me they haven't. I sadly admit to doing it, which isn't really nice. <br>  <br>  We're so worried about our appearance because we don't to be judged negatively or have negative things said about us, when in fact it's going to happen no matter how nice or pretty you look. People always find something to nit - pick at about you. <br>  <br>  As for me personally, I do care about my looks - they're not the number one thing I care about, but they're up there because I like to look good for me. When I look good and feel clean I feel nice on the outside I feel nicer in the inside.|`|00edd366abb2b33249aae666469aaa31aa	I saw this question on the answers home page. I don't usually hang out in the beauty section. As a middle aged adult, I will say to you that these teens sense how looking good gets you ahead, possibly even places you have no right to be based on your attainments. This gives it value to them.|`|gMsR5oWDaa	AMEN!!!!!!!|`|X0AAQra9aa	People, especially teenage girls, get very concerned about the way they look because they want to impress people around them. Especially teenage boys, who love to see impressive looking girls. I, for example, always have to make sure my hair and make-up is perfect for going out and also making sure that my clothes are co-ordinated and don't clash. The majority of teenagers here care about the way they look. It's natural.|`|YQ3d6sUVaa	well i guess they have lots of pressure on them to look good?
M1PYqC3qaa	I think red lips look especially good if you have pale skin. Also, it's important that if you are going for siren lips, then do not over-state the eyes, because that just makes you look too fake and done-up! Pick one feature to eccentuate: the eyes or the lips, not both.<br>   Other than that, if it's for a special event and you are wearing the right clothes to match, I think it can look great.<br>   I think it looks especially great on Scarlet Johannson.|`|9UgGwvtlaa	I DIE FOR REP LIPSICK<br>  IT ENHANCES ALREADY BEAUTIFUL FULL LIPS..CHECK IT OUT<br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D5efOKj2eak/R5YzB-sAS9I/AAAAAAAAAM0/MM5IzJa9GM8/s320/Kim-Kardashian0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D5efOKj2eak/R5...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IsT-MROFqXU/SWMi0EoZpJI/AAAAAAAAAfI/9fAMznOZ11E/s320/sexy+lips19.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IsT-MROFqXU/SW...</a><br>  <br>  it screams red siren!! its hot..especially on people with darker hair . think pin up sexy look<br>  <br>  <br>  NOBODY SHOULD TELL U HOW YOU NEED TO APPLY UR MAKEUP<br>  <br>  all makeup artists say..there are no rules in makeup, only rule of thumbs!<br>  if u wanna rock the red...GO FOR IT!!<br>  <br>  I loooove red lips.

I'm dying my hair a bright-ish red colour latter this week hopefully. It's on sale in Asda, ha ha, and especially for dark hair like my dark brown.<br>  <br>  Anyway you'll never know until you've tried make-up on yourself. If you like it on, go for it and just wear it. It's your body nobody elses.<br>  <br>  I wear red lipstick with a clear gloss on top and get mixed opinions as I put it on quite thick. Then it's the same with bright mixed colour eye shadows. Some people can pull off all different bright colours all the way up to their eyebrows. I only suit bright mixed colours up to the end of my eyelid/crease in eye socket instead.<br>  <br>  Everyone suits different things, if you post pictures we can give you our personal opinions but even if everyone hated it and you liked it I would honestly hope you'd keep on wearing it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|VRI9zTeraa	I would love to wear red lipstick, but I have never tried it and am afraid it may look too drastic. However I think its gorgeous especially if you keep the rest of your makeup really natural. I am also not a fan of red clothing for some reason...|`|WN3zVptRaa	I LOVE red hair. (Like auburn not fire truck red) and I like red lipstick for fancy days, but on normal occasions its too much|`|WVVdf4ILaa	if you wear red lipstick then you cannot wear any eye makeup. well maybe mascara. for some odd reason guys always look at girls lips thats why the guys like it|`|jfsBX6kJaa	I love red like strawberry blond|`|JsGX1bfRaa	I think red lipstick on a woman makes her look sexy. A red dress works too as long as she has a figure that goes with it.|`|TwPrP32Paa	Red is cool
EL45UeUJaa	Yeah your seriously already pretty without a lot of makeup, but if you want a little more, i would just say add a little pink blush to your cheeks, maybe some brown eyeliner to the top eyelid (just a thing line) and on the upper inner waterline to define it. (i would use the twist up kind) and black or brown mascara.<br>   :D|`|noUZuLV8aa	thats all what u want ...  =))|`|Q683orIMaa	For you:<br>  Nars blush in Nico which has this beautiful pink/brownish undertone(great for your skint tone!)or Mac's mineralize blush in Warm Soul.<br>  Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation in one of their lightest shades.<br>  Lipgloss(whatever you do stay away from nudes. You already have a fair complexion really light colors will make you look washed up)<br>  You don't really need mascara and if you want to get one get in a dark brownish color not black or navy.|`|NFn7G28laa	You could do a lot with your make-up<br>  But If you don't want anything big then just wear a bit of eyeliner as well as mascara and foundation.<br>  Bourjois khol and contour eyeliner is amazing!! :D<br>  Eyeliner makes your eyes stand out more and just generally makes them more pretty.<br>  Btw you've got a really pretty face but I think you could do with a more excitingg haircut. Maybe some side bangs and/or layers? <br>  Hope this has helped :)|`|ncCWCIEFaa	You don't need a lot of make up to look good take care of you skin with a good skin care routine and drink lots of water get plenty of sleep.  Make sure you use an SPF.<br>  A little blush and lip gloss are all you need and for the eyes try Mary Kay's eyecicles it is a liquid eye shadow in a tube it drys to a powder.|`|wrEKaaGlaa	you look nothing like your avatar|`|FdLmXTVmaa	you're really pretty =) maybe put a little foundation on with eyeliner on your lower lid and mascara:) if you want to go out, you can put a little gold eyeshadow on your eyelids because that will compliment you skin and hair colour. Finish it with light pink or clear lipgloss and your beautiful smile xx|`|RPd66ldYaa	First, you are BEAUTIFUL with your natural look. So, like you said you didn't want anything major. The best makeup I've ever used (and once started using it - I've never wasted money on other brands) is MAC. You can look on the website and then locate a store where they sell it. Some simple powder (studiofix is the best) and some lip gloss and lip liner might really enhance your beauty.|`|LCCVCHmWaa	your very very very pretty and dont need any makeupif u had any on in those pics then thats perfect for you most guys dont like makeup on girls most tend to over doit you have a perfect amount!|`|6mgqAxYSaa	You don't need anymore make-up!! You look great as you are!|`|jfsBX6kJaa	a little blush and eye shadow,lip color. your cute too all by yourself.|`|BC0oVruEaa	eye liner<br>  &<br>  blush<br>  <br>  you don't need a lot.
belAs0u1aa	I wouldn't take it to the store if i was You, they may think you stole it!<br>  <br>  What you should do is get some pliers and cut of the nail going through the clothing and the ink thing.<br>  <br>  As long as you don't try to pull the tag of because then there will be a hole where the nail was and the ink would come out.So don't pull ! :)<br>  <br>  PS. be careful when using the pliers, easy to pinch you're fingers with them|`|NBi07o6zaa	Take it to a chain clothing store like Kohl's or K-Mart, they'll remove it for you.|`|qWAISvgmaa	just bring it up to a store in the mall, and ask if they can remove it for you.|`|RbCsBbhLaa	Well looking at the brand on the clothing you should be able to tell where you got it. At a store they would be more likely to take it off for you if they now you didn't steal it. Just explain that they didn't take the tag off when you bought it. <br>  Good Luck!!
V9NGGPP5aa	Women/girls have 20 % more fat than men/boys. This fat gives smoothness and round shape to the female organs. Male has more muscular body which make it rough.|`|qDQOuTrHaa	bcoz guys have a soft and pure heart........that a reason they need hard body to protect it.............got it dear|`|yqVojuXVaa	Hmm...I know a boy that has really smooth skin. Smoother than mine. Lol|`|VRI9zTeraa	because of estrogen. Estrogen is responsible for us having less hair than men, more smoother skin, and our body fat distribution in our hips and thighs.|`|y7OPY5laaa	We are just born like that,[i think lol] Just think,Boys play rough sports,and they fight with other people to see who is stronger..and their skin gets all dry and it starts to peel,and they get bruises and cuts on them. And some of them don't care. They do more physical activities than women. Which means they probably stay out in the sun more,[I heard it peels your skin] From the sun's harmful ray's. They get sunburns a lot too. And they get dirtier. Girls tend to buy a lot more skin products to help them,so that could be another reason girls skin is smoother than boys. [Not to mention we shave a lot,]|`|n4ie8Hidaa	it is not said that girls have smother body then boys.everyone has an smother skin.even i am a boy.i also haves it amn smoth skin..!!|`|aHER8myJaa	estrogen... guys in prison who take birth control for the estrogen get softer skin and grow boobs and hips and higher voices|`|NJbLm7Pyaa	it is a natural and great gift of god.

BUT-If you go to an outlet they have a single pair for $20. The sizes run a bit bigger in my view though. HotTopic has bizarre wicked designs and their jeans last long-They're like $40? But if you find them on sale they're usually $30. So yeah..Just go to the mall, and they're probably tons of stores with cheap skinnies-cause theyre so in styleee right now.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps(:|`|O9VN7SGiaa	hmm maybe pac-sun... but theres could range up to 40-50 dollars. or RUE-21
BTI0XOptaa	Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. They are also ineffective as head lice have become immune to them.<br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AHHDYeWfaa	shave it off sorry|`|hnFBGG9aaa	Buy lice shampoo but youll be very frustrated washing it with long hair.  My mom cut mine shoulder length to make life a lot easier.|`|gw7GoKAraa	Get lice shampoo and inform the school nurse pronto!<br>  <br>  **no school for you for a few days- what a shame!**|`|Zx23ZXgGaa	Buy lice shampoo and wash your hair with it untill it tells you to stop.|`|jfsBX6kJaa	At the store, Lice MD,works great.|`|KnONmxvEaa	inform your school and your thoughts about the source you believe you got it from.  Got to your local drugstore and ask the pharmacist for lice shampoo recommendation- new and better products coming out all the time but don't worry it is easier to treat than it use to be. It is just a pain to have to go through.  Make sure you change and bleach all your bed linens, towels, etc.
k3XnrB2Naa	I like the blue they're cute, but you can wear the black ones with anything, and the pink are ok|`|KFwXBXv7aa	black|`|jpTl3o5naa	They are all nice but I am a female so the blue ones and then the pink ones.

Nupv5Uzlaa	I'm sure you can, so long as the sun is shining upon you.<br>  Though I bet it would feel quite cold to tan in 65 degree weather.<br>  <br>  It's winter time here in Florida and I'm pretty darn sure that tanning is possible.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	If it's sunny I'm sure it's possible.  Just make sure to use sunblock to decrease the risk of damage, even if it's not that hot.|`|NoxXvT1waa	Of course you can, as long as the sun's shining.<br>  That's why people always come back from skiing holidays with goggle marks around their eyes, clear skies and a lot of sun give them a tan.<br>  ;)
24sK6L2uaa	As long as in the ingredient it doesn't say it has iodine in it you are ok.|`|c9cTrfqEaa	Any salt should be ok as long as its put into boiling water and disolved.
