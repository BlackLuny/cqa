20090309120622AARzMJG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Ok, I tried to start writing a book.?	I thought I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted the book to be about but then I realized that it seemed like everyone was writing about the same thing or had the same sort of theme or conflict in their book. So, I need some suggestions of themes/conflicts to write about. It's sort-of along the lines with vampires or something.

20090309131842AAaQBNp	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	Girls, do you know it too?	I'm not like any kind of kung fu master or nothing like that, but i always thought that if a girl would ever go and try to slap my face that i would just reach out and block away their hand. Not hitting them back, but just blocking it so when they try to slap it won't work. Well, this girl did try to slap me, and what i thought doesn't work. But that's because she used some tricky move on me that totally confused me so i couldn't move at all. She stood right in front of me and was standing with a hip out and a hand on it. I only had a second, but i was paying attention to her left hand cuz that was the one she had placed on her hip. But she put her right hand out and slapped me, and there's like, no way to block that move. If there is, i don't have a clue how. It works. Will you tell me if there is, just in case a girl ever tries something like that again? And, have you ever used that on a guy before?

20090227151008AA9L2Cs	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Let me tell you a little story about my music box.?	~My Music Box~   My music box is small,   It sits inside my heart.   And opens oh so softly,    With care, notes fly like larks.      The music that flows   Is light, but minor keyed.   Because I am so young, so free,   And joy is but a little seed.      My music box lets music out.   Its flow is just like tears.   The joy seed grows with hope,   The notes feed it, for it hears.      Dancing sounds, like laughter,   Sounding bright with life.   Making playful jumps and nips,   My music, freed from strife.      Sudden, happy hopefulness,   Unexpected, heart a-flutter.   The joy seed blooms and rushes up,   My heart can't help but stutter.      A discordant sound, off-key--offbeat,   The little joy song ends.   This newer song is cold and harsh,   The flowered joy seed bends.      The intermission is short, though,   And the joy song starts again.   More fervent than before,   More light and much less strain.      The joy flower rises so soft,   Its petals flushed and smooth.   With healthy leaves and careful stem,   My joy flower lives in couth.      But yet again, the bitter sound,   Ends the joy song much too soon.   My music box plays roaring sounds,   Like screams at a sallow moon.      The solemn sound, but near a rage,   Makes the joy flower wilted.   My music box is shutting now,   Why do I feel so jilted?         What does it need?

Here is the prelude to a story i am writing in 14 yrs old and I was wondering if im any good?                                                                                                                                          *The World On It's Deathbed*      The biginning of it all was a dark and musty night, on a street with old gray brick apartments on either side. Cool air swept down the streets and allyways creating a whistling humm. A muffled noise of classical music could be heared around every corner. As the lights went off in every window it echoed from an old rusty man-hole located in the center of a narrow ally. Down in the sewer pipe sat a dark figure. His bright green eyes reflected the dimly lit street above. He wore a white hooded shirt with thick gray canvas shoulder pieces riveted to the cloth. For trousers he wore old gray jeans which nearly covered up his green high-top shoes. All of his clothes were worn out and dimmed, perhaps several years old. He sat on a half inch plywood sheet that sudspended him from the constant misty stream below. His radio was an old plasic block of mildew, it had little battery life left. Harold turned it off for the night and slipped inside a cocoon like sleeping bag made from old sheets. His breath made a light fog as the pipe grew colder and colder. He dare not make a fire for fear of getting cought living in the conditions he was. Harold diden't like to live like evryone else, he was different he was the kind of person who never made any friends. He dident need friends because Harold only needed himself and he liked his small home. Munutes later darkness flooded the tunnel and he went to sleep. A fter a few hours Harold awoke to a gushing noise from the north end of the pipe. The pitch of the sound grew lighter like the filling of a pale, Harold sat up startled at this and began to look down the tunnel. Immediatly a wall of water blasted Harold for a mad ride down the pipe, and a mad ride it was as Harold picked up speed slinging around various corners struggling to keep above water. The pipe grew smaller and smaller as he shot down at the highest speeds. Soon enough it was only as wide as Harold and it was a bit of a squeze. The building up of pressure blasted out into a dark open space, and began to fall deeper into the pitch black below. He twisted and kicked in mid air struggling to oriant himself. The Room echoed from even the slightest noise, and it seemed like forever untill harold hit water immediatly stunning his speed. With a big splash the sound all halted and harold floated weightlessly under the surface. He Kicked the rough bottom and thrusted back above the water. Drops of the sewer water rained on his head contenuesly, Harold swam over to a dark corner and shielded his head. He soon nodiced the room was square and very high, there was about five feet of water in the bottom and a small hole on one size let light in, it was about the size of a quarter. The loud sound of gushing water was a constant, and Harold soon nodiced the walls seemed to have a thick layer of charcoal on them. He sat for hours watchng the water splash about, he wauld try to find a pattern in the way they fall. As this happened harold grew colder as his clothes grew wetter, and pulled his hood over his face. He had not nodiced that he had fallen asleep as he leaned against the wall. The water stopped falling and silence filled the room. Only the sound of wind occasionally gushing through the hole in the wall. He was dreaming black, but a plesant black, the sound of wind relaxed him and set the coolest of moods. He waited for hours trying to calm himself im the dark metalic dongen. Immediatly after hearing a loud groaning noise and wind gushing Harold awoke nodiceing that the sound was real and the room shook deeply. He swam over to the hole and peered through. From the low angle he was at Harold saw was red sky and clouds swishing around pulseinging, creating small vortexes and twists. The sky streched and warped for some time, Harold stood astonished, then a deep noise that soulded like thunder began ripping across the backdrop. It seemed to approach as the she sound grew louder. Wind began blasting through the small rusty hole and the sound grew fierce. Harold ducked away from the hole as the room began vibrating shakeing the black coal into the water near him. Then all sound stopped and a loud bang dented in all sides of the box,  Harold was shunted into a small corner. Then the sound started again like the approach of a train. This time when it hit he was knocked out with the force.

I have minimal experience with recording technology.   I own a video camera that records decent quality audio, which I have been using up until now to record my songs, and I have Audacity installed on my computer.   What equipment do I need to purchase, if any? I am only 16 and I don't have a real job, so I'd need to get something with a good quality for the least amount of money possible. And is audacity an okay program to use to edit with?

My friend has known her for awhile but never liked her. My boyfriend loves her but I think that its just because she's his niece.

FROM      I d e a.      by Michael Drayton         LXII.      WHEN first I ended, then I first began,     The more I travelled, further from my rest,    Where most I lost, there most of all I wan,    Pinèd with hunger rising from a feast.    Methinks I fly, yet want I legs to go,    Wise in conceit, in act a very sot,    Ravished with joy amid a hell of woe ;    What most I seem, that surest am I not.    I build my hopes a world above the sky,    Yet with the mole I creep into the earth,    In plenty I am starved with penury,    And yet I surfeit in the greatest dearth ;        I have, I want, despair and yet desire,        Burned in a sea of ice and drowned amidst a fire.

Has to be about a male, who falls in love, but has a dangerous twist to the love he shares. Here's the preface of it all, but i can't figure out what the dangerous twist should be.     I was thinking of maybe doing a twilight spinoff, butt...i think thats a bit cheesy. Helllppp!??                          PREFACE   I had never thought, that anyone in the world could just walk into my life and become everything I would ever live for. I always felt too strong, or so much better than anyone else I had ever met…It just didn’t seem possible.  Nobody, could beat the walls I had set up around myself. Not my mom, or her stupid husband, Chad. (Or my seemingly non-existing  father, Bill. Who just happen to disappear whenever my mom tried to contact him on holidays or my birthday when I was a kid.) I was Luke Hampton, and it was my goal in life for nobody to ever get past those walls.    That was of course, until that day in World History that  Leila Jaynes    showed up at our school. The second she walked by my desk , a pressure evolved in my chest. It wasn’t till after she passed, that I realized that pressure was my heart pounding, begging to be let out of my chest. That day ended my life as simply Luke Hampton. My life would revolve only around Leila, she had become my only need from the moment she walked into our classroom. It was dangerous, unacceptable, and the most stupid thing I could have ever done…our lives, could never be the same.

Because right now I hate everything    Around me   Everything, even to the smallest;    sound, like a clock ticking on a wall   annoys the crap out of me   Then suddenly I feel love   The warmth of it   Tingles around my presence   I feel like crying    Because I always say the wrong things   And do the wrong things   I wish I could apologize    But do the ones who   Hurt me   Say sorry?   Am I paranoid?   Or am I just confused?    Mixed feelings   Are truly    Dreadful

20090309145233AAIPsM2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What was a book of Jamaican ghost stories published in the UK in the 1980s with a coffin+ a ghost on the cover?	This book was in circulation in the 1980s, so I don't think it was "Duppy Talk" or "Duppy Tales" unless those books are older than they seem. The front cover featured a night scene with a coffin surrounded by candles. The smoke from the candles rises up to create the form of a ghost. I believe the title was something like Jamaican or Caribbean Ghost Stories. The stories inside contained stories about weird kids with no faces and backward feet and a ghost that played guitar. Can anyone confirm the existence of this book and help me track it down?

20090309150449AAIwg2T	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like our tween book idea?	my friend and i want to write a teen book. we don't want it to be cliche or anything and this is one of our idea-   one of our ideas is to write about a princess who hates her life in the castle and wants desperately to get out. she hates all the duties and popularity of it and just want to be a normal 16 year old girl then she finds a hidden book that leads her to a new world. when she gets to the world it is all she ever dreamed of being. she loves it there and never wants to leave. but then she finds out her family is in trouble && she wants to save them. but the catch if she leaves her new world she can never come back. so will princess Layla choose her family that she loves, or the world she ever dreamed of?      another idea is that a girl lives with a horrible mother who is an alcoholic and a drug attic, but cant run away to her father because she doesn't know who he is. when she runs away she finds her father somewhere. she thinks he is the most amazing father until she finds out his background information. he is an escaped serial killer and is attempting to kill her. will leshia escape before her father makes her yet another one of his murder victims?   please tell me if you think this is a good idea or not or if you think that you have any better ideas, or anymore details. anything is welcome(:   THANK YOUUU(:

20090309154931AAxSM2Y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Will you compare these two descriptive paragraphs? Which one sounds better?	Two friends and I are having a contest. Whose paragraph sounds better? All three paragraph are the first introductions to a character. Our stories and writing styles are very different. Paragraph 1 is from a fantasy story that takes place on earth roughly 400 million years in the future. Paragraph 2 is taken from an action/romance about the mafia, government corruptness, and an assassin. Paragraph 3 is from a science fiction story that involves genetic crossing between humans and other species as a plot point. Give a 1-10 rating for paragraph one which follows:                  Picture a young man, his dark leathery wings the same colour as his oily black hair; his eyes the colour and opalescence of grey moonstone. Akin to the typical citizen of Moonlight, his fingers are clawed as a cat’s and his pale skin appears to hold a certain flaky fluorescence. On his chin are the scant, barely visible beginnings of a beard. Loved by none, lover of no one, Shaft of Moonlight is a Wanderer. The Wanderers are generally treated with the same hospitality as lawyers or taxmen, as you surely know.   Picture the ever-present-over-water smog, being penetrated by a sudden ray of blinding rose light, and the brimstone brine that blanketed the brackish floor of the lake being dissolved by this light.       Now a 1-10 rating for paragraph two:      As the sun quietly set on the horizon, Nathaniel found it ever more difficult to concentrate. There were so many things that could go wrong at any moment; in fact, it was a miracle that they had lasted this long without being taken out. He admired his father for keeping the mob so well organized, however, he knew that he could not possibly do so well himself. Not only that, but people were determined he never get a chance to lead. With twelve known attempts on his life, and possibly more that never got off the ground, Nathaniel Skye is one of the few teenagers ever to face the perils of death by assassination.     Because of this, and much more, he is currently writing a suicide note.      Paragraph three:       Leo jumped down from one of the rafters on the thirty-foot-tall ceiling and landed nimbly on his toes in the middle of the crowd.  There was silence. While Ylva’s voice wavered uncertainly when she talked, due to some odd gene that controls the great howls of wolves, Leo’s voice was a sort of crooning; he could have any person entirely mesmerized when he talked. This has always seemed odd to me; cats are more knows for their silence than they are for their vocal abilities, but sometimes you never know.   “It doesn’t seem unethical to me, and doesn’t my opinion matter the most? Besides, if these good scientists didn’t behave incredibly ‘unethically’ I currently wouldn’t exist. And I will say I’m rather happy to be alive,” he continued.      Which paragraph is the best?
20090309155609AAranNO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Will you critique an ode to vanishing poems?	Can words vanish once read   if they stay in your heart   but now on page    have disappeared?      Penned images of beauty profound   that warmed this awakening soul   piqued a dulled imagination and   gave birth to a new private vision   resulting in a pen of her own.

I have written much more than this.      #1   I pointed my weapon towards his view,    My shiny revolver gripped tight.   I told the saddest story of a lonely sole,   Who just wanted to end the pain in the night.      #2   Will I ever amount to anything,   Am I another to be gone by the sound of a bang,   Is there anything in life set out for me,   Or is the writing on the wall not to be seen?      I no longer have this love for you,   I am sure it has ended for you, too.   My dreams have left you in the night,    Because if they hadn't, I would have to end my life.      #3   Ridin' across the west,   Just letting off the stress,   Can't get her off my mind.   But that doesn't matter,   And I won't get any sadder,   'Cause there's still many more roads to wind.      #4   Tell me that I am wrong,   That together we still belong,   That I will always have a place in your heart.      And forget about his lies,   It was just him in disguise,   Trying to tear us apart.      I have maaaaaany many more poems of equal or greater importance.

Like all the characters are reincarnated as college students. With the exception of Dr. Van Helsing and Dracula, of course.   But Mina and all the rest will be reincarnated as present-day university students.   How do you think I should write it?   Mina would be an education major, Jonathan would be an accounting major, Seward would be a psychology major, and in my fanfic, he would be an assistant at the asylum as practice before he graduates. Lucy and Arthur will be two of the richest and spoiled kids on campus, and I'll make Arthur the son of a governor or mayor. Quincey Morris would be too adventurous to know what to do in life, so he's undecided.   And every character in the book has a feeling that it has happened somewhere before. Like deja vu.   Would that work?

An idea just occurred to me while reading - http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Augment    As magnificent of a villain as Khan Noonien Singh was (RIP Ricardo, you are missed!), how would modern day humans behave in a similar situation?   Imagine (this is all hypothetical, I know) you and group of 70 of you friends and acquaintances are surrounded by less evolved humans from 40,000 years ago. Leave aside issues of time travel and ancestry (IT'S ALL HYPOTHETICAL).   How bound would you and your friends feel by their society and laws?   You have the benefit of the past 500 years worth of scientific and technological breakthroughs! You are probably taller, stronger, have a better knowledge of martial arts than they do. They might even have less developed speech.   And there is competition for resources!   How bound would you and other humans feel by the rules of that society? You are smarter and when you are organized you can kick their A S S.   Can you feel some sympathy with Khan's point of view now?

20090309152818AAAKEAv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What would you choose?	I am making a Fantasy-story with Light, Darkness & Twilight within it. It's about a boy who lost his parents, his name is Zero. But in truth he is The Chosen Hero. He has a legendary weapon (Looks like the Aerial Blades wielded by Xemnas in Kingdom Hearts 2 or the lances wielded by Shanao in Castlevania Order Of Ecclesia). With this he protects the worlds against evil. But in one point of the story he sacrifies himself for his best friend, a girl named Dawn. He's falling into Darkness but because of his strong heart and all the power hide in it, it's finally about to awaken, he'll be neither or Light or Darkness, thus Twilight. He fights villains from Light and Darkness and his biggest opponents are The God Of Darkness & The Goddess Of Light.      So that is kinda the story. But I need a name for the story. Because of the Twilight serie from Stephanie Meyers I can't use the title Twilight. Here are some examples for the title (I like also title with 1 or 2 words) :   - Into the Twilight   - Between Light & Darkness   - Between Dawn & Dusk   - (From) Dawn to Dusk   - Beyond Dawn & Dusk   - Beyond Light & Darkness   - Beyond Twilight   - (From) Light to Darkness   - (I was thinking maybe something with Horizon?)   - (Something else, like.........., I would also like a title with 1 or 2 words)      * I doesn't know a name for the weapon either so maybe you've got an idea, I thought of "Enerblade" but you can also choose own ideas.      I would like Latin or Greek words for the name of the title/weapon also.      And maybe you know a better way to let awaken the Twilight powers from Zero, I fought this way is a little bit stupid. All ideas are welcome.      And I'm sorry if grammar is that worse, I had got some reactions about that.   Thanks ^.^

20090309153226AATF4Vw	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What does forever mean?	How do we know? How long is it? Will we ever know? Does forever really mean what its meant to mean when we say I will love you forever? A poem I have came across recently made me wonder. What do you think about it?               How long is forever?      When you're a child everything seems to take forever   It takes forever to save five dollars   It takes forever to finish college   It takes forever to save for a house   When does that change   When does forever not take so long at all....   When do you learn the the true meaning of forever...   When do you learn that you thought you had forever...but forever no longer means unending happiness...it twists and it turns in an awful way ... you have outgrown your childish notion of forever      ................When you lose someone you love...........      You mourn....You cry... You just don't understand      because       ........You always thought you would have them forever......

I'm a begginer at guitar, and I've been told it's in my best benefit to learn to use all my fingers when playing, even my pinkey (fourth;smallest) finger. However, just like everyone else, at first, it does not move independently like the first, second, or third finger (whenever I bend my fourth finger all the way, the third finger bends in at least half). So can anyone give my any tips on building strength in my pinkey finger, so I can bend it independently to improve my guitar skills?

The rotten rose is ripped from the wall,        to dust, crumbling under merciless hand;   Flecks of grace in spinning tantrums fall,        below to the Earth, becoming vain land.      Whilst on the wall its beauty lingers,        like Eden in life but frozen in years;   Inevitably seized by Fate’s icy fingers,        Beauty rests hidden, immune to tears.      Cursed satin robes with ivory train,        petals so pure, by lust never moved;   Tempestuous Earth, intent for disdain,        fragments forced silent, stoic solitude.      Love, only power too threatening, too blind,        For this by your virtue, on Earth you must die.      ~A.G.

20090309173919AA5jzb4	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you think this is a love poem?	shall i compare thee to a summer's day?; by William Shakespeare      1. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?   2. Thou art more lovely and more temperate:   3. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,   4. And summer's lease hath all too short a date:   5. Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,   6. And often is his gold complexion dimmed,   7. And every fair from fair sometime declines,   8. By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:   9. But thy eternal summer shall not fade,   10. Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,   11. Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,   12. When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,   13. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,   14. So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.      is it a love poem, or is it about something else?

20090309123103AA0g8ZV	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Is it too late for me to have a chance at opera?	I'm a seventeen year old girl (a junior in high school) and for years it's been my secret dream to be an opera singer.  I've loved opera for a long time and I always imagine what it would be like to sing in one.  The thing is, I've never been in a theatre class or a play or anything.  I used to sing nonstop in elementary and middle school chorus, and got most of the solos for the soprano parts, but in the beginning of high school I went through a shy phase and didn't want anyone to hear me sing.  I've by no means given up music, but I haven't had any real training besides elementary and middle school chorus.  I've read that opera singers don't begin training their voices for opera until they're in their 20s, but with my inexperience in acting and singing, is it too late for me to have a shot at opera?  I could sign up for Theatre next year, but it would only be Theatre I, and me as a senior in with a bunch of freshmen... is that a good idea?

We need to pick a poem, analyze it and write a 500-750 word essay. This poem is easy to understand, and has a really nice theme to it. Only problem is, i really never learned to break down POETRY. Im not sure what kind of rhyme scheme it uses, what it would be catagorized as (free verse, monologue, ect.), or anything like that. i know it has some personification to an extent. It gives numbers and mathmatical formulas human-like actions and emotions, but at the same time it all fits togehter it what a mathmatical formula would literally do. so to some extent it does not use personification, right? confusing i know. anyways...any help would be appreciated!! thanks!(poem follows)      I’m sure that I will always be   A lonely number like root three      The three is all that’s good and right,   Why must my three keep out of sight   Beneath the vicious square root sign,   I wish instead I were a nine      For nine could thwart this evil trick,   with just some quick arithmetic      I know I’ll never see the sun, as 1.7321   Such is my reality, a sad irrationality      When hark! What is this I see,   Another square root of a three      As quietly co-waltzing by,   Together now we multiply   To form a number we prefer,   Rejoicing as an integer      We break free from our mortal bonds   With the wave of magic wands      Our square root signs become unglued   Your love for me has been renewed

20090309163854AA83TwP	Arts & Humanities;History	Good titanic report so far?	The Titanic is one of the most famous passenger ships in history. Ever since 1908, when it started to be built, until today, people have been fascinated by it. For some people it may be because of its size and grandness, or maybe because of its sinking and re-discovery. For me, it is all of these things. I have always been interested in the Titanic and I knew a lot about it before we even started brainstorming. There is always more to learn though, so I chose to do my project on the Titanic.   By doing this project, I hoped to learn new things about this famous ship. Since I already knew so much, I did not know if this was going to work. When I started researching, I did not have anything particular that I wanted to learn. It turns out that I really did not know everything and I learned a lot of new facts. I am really glad that I chose to do this topic.    I started doing research by searching for informational websites about the Titanic. Since websites are not always creditable, I decided to look for new ways to find information. I looked in books, encyclopedias, and magazines. I watched many television shows also. I took notes on the computer and put them into my subtopics. This was really helpful because I could just take the notes from there to write my report. I did not really come to any problems. Because of the popularity of the fate of the Titanic, there are many interesting books, newspaper articles, websites, museum exhibits, and documentaries that were available to assist my research. (or) Because the Titanic is so well known, there were many websites, books, magazine articles, and television shows about it.   Since the Titanic was the biggest ship of its time, the building of it was a huge deal to everyone who heard about it. The Harland and Wolff Company started to think about building a luxurious ship in 1907. In 1908 the construction finally began in Belfast, Ireland. Thomas Andrews, the head of the Harland & Wolff design department, designed the ship to be the grandest in the world. He also wanted it to be, “practically unsinkable.” He designed it with a double hull and put in 16 watertight compartments. If even two of the middle compartments, or four of the front, flooded, the Titanic would still stay afloat. The Titanic had steel rivets instead of iron ones. The rivets had to be riveted with machinery that was too bulky to fit around the curve of the bow of the ship. Steel is much stronger than iron and cannot be hammered in by hand. Because of this, the workers hammered in iron rivets. This potentially weakened that section on the ship, the section that was struck by the iceberg. With all of these features, the Titanic cost about $7.5 million, which is equivalent to about $400 million today. About 15,000 people worked to build the ship. Each worker was paid only about $10 dollars a week.    There were many features on the Titanic that were unheard of at the time. It was 882 ? feet long. If it were to stand straight up it would have been taller than any of the buildings of its time. The Titanic had the first ocean liner swimming pool. One of its very well known features is the grand staircase. Only 1st class passengers were allowed to use this magnificent staircase with oak railings and paneling. Another feature was the gymnasium. 1st class passengers could use this to work out whenever they pleased. Along with these, the Titanic also had a Turkish bath, smoking room, dining saloon, café Parisian, palm court, writing room, reception room, and lounge. The Titanic also had very spacious decks. In Bruce Ismay’s 1912 testimony after the ship had sunk, he confessed to have been the one to reduce the lifeboat number from 48 to 16. He said that he did not want the decks to be too cluttered. He also suggested that the watertight compartments would be only 10 feet above the water line to create more room for the state rooms.       The Titanic’s maiden trans-Atlantic voyage was on April 10, 1912. No one ever dreamed that its first voyage would also be its last. Captain Smith planned to cross the Atlantic in 6 days. The Titanic would have had to cross the 3000 mile ocean at just over 19 knots or 22 miles per hour. When it left Southampton, England to go to New York, there was a huge crowd watching it leave for the first time. Everyone was interested in what the press called “the practically unsinkable ship.” There were only 16 lifeboats aboard. The Titanic passed inspection even though there were only enough lifeboats for about 1,100 people of the 2,200 passengers and crew. At this time, this was acceptable even though the size of ships had quadrupled in the last 15 years, the lifeboat regulation stayed the same. It was believed to be the safest ship in the world because of its watertight compartments.    For all the passengers and crew members on the ship knew, everything was going smoothly. Unbeknownst to them, the southern route that Captain Smith chose to take to avoid icebergs, was leading them in a d

Why are people like this?   Why would they rather share their opinion of a soft drink, for example, rather than actually help someone?       I doubt that I'll get too many answers on this (people are too busy voicing their opinions on "Hot or Cold?") but we'll see . . .

Does anyone, maybe some of you college edumacated types know of any books or authors that deal with attempting to grasp the concept of eternity? It doesn't much matter to me the perceived degree of success. I'm really just looking for an attempt. Barring that type of response, perhaps someone has thoughts that could be shared along the same lines? Does the concept of eternity or something eternal by definition assume that it exists outside of time? Would an eternal object posses the ability to change? Or would it remain static to facilitate "eternal" status? (Though I suppose that leads to the question of whether or not change in an object causes the object to become a different object altogether. Which would be a different question.)    It also occurs to me that I also might be starting this question off the wrong way.

She's weak, dependant on Edward, shallow, scarily unfit, and to top it all off, their relationship is unhealthy.      She gets her way by whining and bullying Edward (4th book especially), she breakes down totally when he leaves her, she says numerously that she would 'die if he ever left her' (i mean, is that a good message to be sending out??), and she has no life outside Edward, complaining about Mike, and cooking.

20090309165337AAR4XR7	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is there a "right way" to interpret a Langston Hughes poem?	Hi everyone. I'm doing a project on Langston Hughes, focusing on his poem "Jazzonia." As I have to interpret the poem to present it, I find that I can come up with various meanings for the imagery within it. This isn't the first time that something like that happens to me with a Langston Hughes poem, so... is there always more than one possible interpretation for his work? Or is it this poem in particular?   Or am I completely far off from the meaning?      Thanks a bunch :)
20090309165440AACMIFN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone know the title of this book?	I read this book a long while back, and I don't know I really want to know what it was called...      It was about a girl who got in a car crash in the very first pages of the book, then while in the hospital got herself possessed by her dead twin sister who died when they were young.   Then all the while through the story the twin will randomly take over her actions and was making her do stuff that she didn't want to do.      At the end, she realizes from her mother, in a weird twist of events, that she wasn't the twin she thought she was, when her twin died she started calling herself by her twin's name and had convinced herself that she was her, so basically you could say that SHE died...I don't know that's the best way that I can sum it up...      I just have been so freaking curious for the longest time now...NEED TO KNOW.      Thanks.

If you could read this poem i just wrote and tell me if you understand it and what it means.    Thanks!                  Complexity of life.      Simplicity is our easiest route out of an excuse   It is a rarity to find, and is found only on occasion   The rest of our life is revolved around the matter of complexity   The mere journey of life and its soul changing obstacles   Life is a present that appeared out of no where   Now we are living it in the masses    A mass which was molded for perfection and unity   That along the line dived itself repeatedly   Controversy, foul play, corruption, and division upon debatable arguments   Are the core values to complexity   Consistently making life a less worth and more difficult journey   Simplicity is derived from happiness and complexity derived from sadness   In detail happiness is a goal in life supposed to guide us on the paved paths   And sadness is swept away into the rooted and over grown trails that you find yourself lost in   Life began simple, but we will never see that light of day again   Because times have changed and so have we   We have created our own destruction and lost meaning of life, pure happiness isn’t welcome   Life is and always will be complex, with the complexity of life being living itself

20090309172641AAQ6TyC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need help finding the titles and authors of four books. Two I read when I was younger, and one I just found?	The first I though was called 'Forest Witch' but that turned out to be the wrong title. It's a fantasy set in the Medieval era. It has to do with a young girl running away from her uncle who wants to marry her and she finds a cottage in the forest and becomes a healer. I can't remember much else except that it has a monastery and nuns in it. I think it was called 'St. James Monastery.'      The second is about a kid who gets saved when the monks come to collect the bodies from the Plague. He gets taken back to the monastery and even though he can't walk and he becomes really skilled in building things with wood.      The third is a retelling of the noah's arc with the main character being a protagonist and falling in love w/ one of noah's sons. I thought it was called 'last unicorn' or 'last of the unicorns.'      The fourth is a new book that I saw in my library. It was about the greek gods being in modern england. Aphrodite was at a love-hot line. Athena was finding it weird being a virgin in modern times.      Anyways, if anyone can help me that would be great. Thanks so much!

Btw sry it's not much yet :P      Clinging to a solid stone wall hundreds of feet above a dirty moat filled with scaly, overgrown snakes that were just dying for me to fall was not the image that filled my mind when I imagined a picnic.   Of course, I wasn’t here for a picnic, but it still wasn’t very fun.  Only someone with no life and still living with their mother at age forty would think of this as fun.   As if the world just wanted to add to my horrendous situation, half the people in the castle I was clinging to were searching for me to drag me to the gallows.  Plus, the brutal summer sun was blazing down on me, and I could almost swear I heard it laughing at me.   But the worst thing was, I was trapped.  I couldn’t go down; the crocodiles were just begging for that.  I couldn’t go up; I was sure to be seen and shot down like a flying duck.  My only other option was to slip through a window and sneak out on the sly.

I decided to lie to my parents. I could easily fool them into thinking I was staying at a friends.   How unsafe could it be anyway. I've been chatting to him for several months now and he seems like a really genuine and respectable guy.      My parents always look over my shoulder when I’m on the computer, They don't trust me I guess. Why should they though? I'm going behind their backs, disobeying their rules.   I suppose I think I can get away with murder, they’ve let me off with everything in the past, and this won't make any difference.      My bag is packed. I'm ready to leave, He's parked down the road so mum and dad don’t suspect anything. I should just check my bag; Make sure I have everything I need:   Change of clothes   Tooth brush   Toiletries   Money      Money, they won't mind me borrowing a few pounds I'm sure.      Seven thirty five, He's there. I'm feeling slightly nervous actually, I've never physically seen Samuel yet, just over the internet. I think we will get on like a house on fire; After all he is my dream guy.    There's nothing for me to stay for here, I haven't got any siblings, not even a pet dog. Just plain old mum and dad.      I feel my heart beating right out of my chest. I've actually thought that there could be consequences involved, but nothing Samuel or Sam as he likes to be called couldn't fix.   I can see his car just as he explained, Metallic blue, Tinted windows. He got them so he could have a little privacy. I never did understand what that meant.      He doesn't look like the Sam I met online, He looks older. Maybe it's just the fuzzing on the web cam that gave him his youth, but I know how old he is, I trust him. he's twenty five, No older and nothing could make me think any different, until his head turned, The first thought that come to my head was that he sent his grandfather or I've just mistaken the description of the car.   "Emily?"    I'm frozen at this point; I can't look at him never mind answer his question.    "Why is the door locked? Why can't I get out?" I shouted. His hand is approaching mine; I'm shaking for my life.   "You'll be safe Emily, I promise."   The sound was horrific. His car wheels screeching along the dry, winding road.   How could I fall for this, My parents were right as usual, " Don't talk to strangers, Don't accept anyone's friend request if your not aware of who they are."   I bought this upon my self. I haven't got the strength to tackle him, I can only hope for the best at this point.   "Where are you taking me?"   "You made all the arrangements I'm just the chauffer."   I just want to go home. To my plain old parents, The only people that could ever keep me safe. I guess it's too late now. It turns out that there are consequences.

Ok so me and about 7-8 friends are doing a bollywood dance for our international festival at our college. We're all indian, but none of us are professional dancers. I'm really concerned about picking the right songs so its fun for all of us to learn the dances and perform, and also fun for the audience to watch.       Right now the songs we are thinking about are:       Dance pe chance- rab ne bana di jodi   Phir milenge chalte chalte- rab ne bana di jodi (I think this is definitely going to be done)   Oh my darling I love you- mujhse dosti karoge   Uncha lamba kad- welcome   Jee Karda- singh is king   Yeh larka hai deewana- kuch kuch hota hai      We're not going to do all of these songs.. but this is just a list of the songs we've come up with. Any suggestions on which songs to do or any kind of help would be appreciated! thank you!!!!!!!
