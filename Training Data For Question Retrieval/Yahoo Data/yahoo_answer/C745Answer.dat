But it does not solve the cause of that underlying stress.  It can make you forget your problems temporarily, but it does not make those problems go away.    Drinking will cause problems of its own:  reduced inhibition, poor motor coordination, general toxicity, loss of work and health.  It will NOT, for example, make that formerly special someone come back to you.|`|HFHKBRkwaa	It all depends on the reason your drinking, if you drink to get over something depressing it will actually get worse... trust someone who's been there. I drank because i found out my boyfriend was married and i had fallen in love with him, it impaired my ability to think right and make good decisions and I ended up in a creek and messed up my car pretty bad. Nothing is worth drinking like that.|`|icTmbLjfaa	hell naw, it actually makes it worst after you sober up|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Sometimes it helps get over a hangover.|`|ZleVRevVaa	Yes, tension.|`|9cTAi7waaa	depends on the something. If you had a fight with your mom-yes. If there was a death in your family-no. Some people who drink away there problems become hard core alcoholics. Its fine to 'get away' from a problem with a wine or martini, but dont be home alone drinking full bottles of vodka|`|DFmzSF7maa	hell ya, just get hammered drunk and you will forget all your worries...hell of a time|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	It gets you over anything you want it to.

We eat it all the time.  It's also nothing like Spinach either.  We use a chunk of chuck( beef) instead of sausage( or mini meatballs).  We use Rice instead of beans.  It's delicious and no, its firm so it won't be like soggy lettuce.  Grated Romano cheese should be on the table for this dish-:)    It's in the endive/chicory family( slight bitterness) but compliments well with a well made broth.( So good--yum)!  From Wiki:    Escarole, or broad-leaved endive (var latifolia) has broad, pale green leaves and is less bitter than the other varieties. Varieties or names include broad-leaved endive, Bavarian endive, Batavian endive, grumolo, scarola and scarole.|`|04Chlqn3aa	I enjoy it for soups but it's not really soggy. Cooking takes the bitterness away. Think of it as spinach. Its in the whole collard green family: swiss chard, kale, etc.  and its very health for you.|`|707gOCvbaa	It taste great  warm and is very firm and not soggy at all. Rachel Ray uses escarole tons of times.
PhPOLgHGaa	i have never ever boiled ribs...    season them and put them in the oven in tightly covered pan with foil....oven at 350 for about 3 hours.....the meat can fall right off the bones....      after the time, uncover carefully as the steam escapes will burn you, drain all the grease....then add your bbq sauce if you want and put back in oven for 15 minutes to let it bake in...( if you dont want the sauce just drain and place back in oven to just let them brown a little bit)|`|hKlsJgVSaa	No, no, no, no, no, no! Do NOT boil the ribs. You just cook them low and slow from the start.  You can smoake them, put them on the grill, or just put them in the oven.     Give them a dry rub of what ever falvors you like, a prepackaged one or make your own. When I do ribs I do this.... chili powder, seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, etc... I actually use what ever looks good and is handy from the cupboard. I like to add a good pinch of brown sugar to help cut the chili powder and other stuff just a bit. Let it sit sit on the ribs at least 1 hour or ever night.    Then place in a roasting pan with a lid, I like to add a bit of juice like a blue berry pomagranite concentrate undilted on the bottom.    I cook on low 300-325 for hours until they are tender. Then add on some b-b-q sauce and cook untill fall off the bone tender.    Or you can double wrap them in foil and cook on a baking sheet low and slow.    Please don't boil them. You will have much better ribs. I've done it both ways and prefer them Not boiled first.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	NEVER BOIL RIBS... unless you like eating 'baby food' texture slop.  If you want to make the ribs more tender, put your oven on the lowest temp ... 170 or so, and just toss the ribs on a cookie sheet and let them sit in there all day,  you may want to dry rub them first.  Take them out when your ready to grill or broil, then do it as you usually do.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Hey Rebok, sorry buddy I'm with Toffy on this one, and to be honest with you, I don't go as far as brushing on the BBQ sauce garbage, but people do I have choice and their own taste.

You want to be able to taste the pork ribs, not sugar!!    Chris|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	I par-boil them for 1/2 an hour; with an onion studded with cloves.  Sometimes I add bay leaves & peppercorns.  Then move them to a rack over a baking pan 40 minutes in 350F oven.  When nicely browned, brush with BBQ sauce & turn at half-time.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	I like to cook them in an aluminum baking pan, just barely covered in water and liquid smoke, at 225 degrees, covered in aluminum foil, for about three hours. Then finish under the broiler with your favorite barbeque sauce until browned. Remove the foil, of course.  ( you'll know they're done when they begin to fall off the bone )|`|HHDq9ajTaa	Dont boil the ribs before you bake them...that removes flavor and has a tendency to remove the natural juices in the meat, and can cause them to be dry. Place them in a baking pan, season them, add 1 1/2 to 2 cups water to the pan and cover the pan tightly with foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours covered, remove the cover, brush on the BBQ sauce, and bake for 30 min and serve. They will be tender, not dry and just delicious. This is for the Beef Ribs. For Pork SpareRibs do the same way, for Pork Back Ribs cut back on the first cooking to about 1 hour, then proceed with the recipe. They will not take that 1 1/2 hour time to cook before you add the sauce. 1 hour add the sauce, then 30 min more. Serve  Trust me on this recipe it always gives juicy delicious ribs....  One more thing....the ribs must be layed flat without double stacking them. Use 2 pans if making them for a crowd. If you are wanting to grill them....do so right off the bat....then add the sauce grill for 5-6 minutes each side. Place in a pan add the water cover them with foil and bake them off to tender out any dried parts for about 30 min. This steaming will help grilling mishaps gone wrong.|`|cddac97d16e342e4a73cf2d576630e1baa	The best recipe for ribs sounds kind of odd- the old fashioned boiling recipe did create steam that helped to tenderize the ribs but also pulled out much of the flavor. The steam can be created without boiling by prebaking ribs in the oven. This really does work, and the plastic wrap does not melt or give off chemicals-you need to buy it from Sams or price club, as you need commercial grade plastic wrap. The plastic wrap traps all of the moisture from the cooking ribs and steams them, but keeps in the flavor.     Season ribs with dry rub and wrap very tightly in about 3 layers of good quality cling wrap. Wrap again tightly in about 3 layers of good quality aluminum foil. Bake in a 350 oven for 2 hours, turning the packages occasionaly.     Unwrap carefully with scissors, and brush with BBQ sauce- these can now be grilled for 10 minutes or so, just to crisp them up, or broil for 10 minutes, if you can't grill or broil, you could bake for 15 minutes at 350 uncovered in the oven.

dqszKQfBaa	I'm an atheist, and gave up meat because I thought it was selfish to killing living animals for my dining pleasure, and plus meat isn't all that good for your body, and I never really liked it all that much anyways.|`|AA12334360	what was the point in asking a question and then ranting about how we are wrong not to eat meat. ?    ( can't be bothered to answer properly, you've already made up your mind I'm wrong )|`|HuJmTs8xaa	I'm a vegan and I did not do it for health. I did it for personal and religious reasons. I am also a Christian. God did not make us and the animals with the intent of us eating each other. He gave humans and the animals all the green plants and things from the ground. Only after Adam and Eve sinned, did eating animals come into play. God is NOT evil. People had to make sacrifices because they were so evil. The blood of the animal is the forgiveness and purification that the sinners needed. It is like the blood of Jesus later on. Without Jesus, billions of people would be without the forgiveness and purification and eternal life that God made possible through Jesus. It is not God's fault that the animals had to be sacrificed. It was a way to have a clean slate for a time.  If people had not sinned, animals and other people would not have to suffer, but it is our evilness, not instinct or whatever else that makes people hurt other living things. Animals have to eat each other to survive, whereas we humans have the choice of any thing to eat that we want. We have everything to choose from and animals only have other animals. It is NOT about what other animals do to each other, because we can't stop what goes on in nature, but we can stop what goes on in our evil hearts. I realized that if I could not eat my dogs, or cats, or fish, or hamsters, or birds, then how is it any different than eating any other animal? Just because I did not know that animal or bond with that animal, doesn't mean it didn't suffer so I could eat it. And the methods that people use today to kill/torture animals is horrid and I want no part in the suffering and pain of any living thing if  I can help it, and I can. I am a proud Christian and vegan and neither will ever change.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	I became vegetarian because I don't want animals to suffer.  I also find the idea of putting dead bodies in my mouth/body repulsive.  Wild animals do kill and torture other animals - they also practise murder of their own kind, rape, incest, cannibalism, theft, bullying, extreme assault....are you suggesting its ok for us to do all those things because wild animals do them?????    Besides we don't eat the animals which kill each other, we eat the gentle vegetarians.    God is not evil and does not like the smell of burning flesh.  If you're an atheist, you don't believe the God of the Bible exists - fine.  But that doesn't mean no God exists.    By saying the God of the Bible is evil and does not exist, therefore no God exists, you are contradicting yourself.  If the Biblical God doesn't exist then its irrelavant what he's like isn't it?  Thats no reflection on the real God.      Oh and I cry over a child's death, even if I didn't know them.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	For me, becoming vegan had nothing to do with religion. I am not a religious person but, I am a spiritual person, I stand firmly by my own beliefs, which are very open to new ideas. I became vegan for eithical reasons, I realized I could live healthily and happily on a vegan diet and I also feel that if it is possible to live on a vegan diet, then there is no reason for one not too. You are saving many sentient beings unnecessary torture.     The reason you say you would not eat an animal you "owned" (you do not own animals - they are companions which you look after) is due to your social and cultural conditioning. You grew up being taught which animals are "right" to eat and which are "wrong" to eat. This really annoys me because people are given a warped view on what we are "suppose" to eat - tradition; turkey at christmas etc.   What gives you the right to take away a life when it is not necessary? What gives us, as a species, to use our resources to manipulate animals, to create different breeds which should never exist (e.g. special types of sheep with folds of fat and wool that are cut up alive)? what gives us the right to mass produce dairy and flesh?    NOTHING.     We are intelligent beings, we do not need flesh to live, for all those people screaming about our canine teeth - they are very slightly pointed - meaning we are omnivores - not carnivores - we are capable of sustaining a plant based diet.    If you had to go out and kill your own food, would you? Many people wouldn't. They make a lazy trip to the grocery store to pick up some packaged "fillet". It sickens me, animals have feelings, emotions, they show remorse, mourning, pain, happiness, companionship  - and what do we do? We treat them like they have no feelings at all.    Theres a schizoid quality to our relationship with animals, in which sentiment and brutality exist side by side. Half the dogs in America will receive Christmas presents this year, yet few of us pause to consider the miserable life of the pigan animal easily as intelligent as a dogthat becomes the Christmas ham.    The New York Times Magazine, An Animals Place  by Michael Pollan, 11/10/02    It is all very well to say that individuals must wrestle with their consciencesbut only if their consciences are awake and informed. Industrial society, alas, hides animals suffering. Few people would themselves keep a hen in a shoebox for her egg-laying life; but practically everyone will eat smartly packaged, farm fresh eggs from battery hensmilk drinkers do not see the calves torn from their mothers.    The Economist, What Humans Owe to Animals, 8/19/95    Many people believe that animals raised for food must be treated well because sick or dead animals would be of no use to agribusiness. This is not true.    The competition to produce inexpensive meat, eggs, and dairy products has led animal agribusiness to treat animals as objects and commodities. The worldwide trend is to replace small family farms with factory farmslarge warehouses where animals are confined in crowded cages or pens or in restrictive stalls.      [][][]So don't try to bullsh!t me with your "it's humane" claims. "Humane" and "murder" just don't go together for me - what? cuddled before killed? Do you people hear yourselves? [][][]      Anyway I hope I cleared some things up and answered your question - now you can make an informed decision. It's great that you love animals but, actions speak louder than words.|`|0fuF2sHbaa	I'm agnostic, pragmatic.    Not eating meat is evolved, so is using the computer. Animals kill the young of their enemies, should we do that too?    I chose not to cause suffering, it's for someone else - that should be respected too, because every life is precious.     Oh and I do cry if someone else's child is hurt - it's empathy. It's something we all should have.|`|LnjyQDpBaa	I felt bad for the animals and its also healthier provided you get protien.|`|BbjELH60aa	I gave up pork and cow because I don't like the taste of it and because we have a ranch down in liberty hill and whenever i go visit, i just always felt horrible thinking about eating them.  I dont eat turkey and Chicken or any other animal with legs because it makes me sad thinking they were once alive, i do eat fish though, i dont feel bad eating them for some reason haha|`|nRObJuJeaa	I'm a vegetarian, and yes, I'm also a Christian. I'm vegetarian mainly for health and compassion purposes.|`|LUL9WNR7aa	I am a former vegetarian.  I even went vegan for about a year.  I did it for animal rights reasons.  I felt that the treatment of animals in the factory farming industry was cruel.  I developed a visceral aversion to animal flesh.  I didn't really see the difference between eating animal flesh and human.  I was also strongly influenced by my (then) boyfriend, who was an animal rights activist.  There wasn't a specific religious reason for giving up meat, but I did feel that it was a moral decision.    I was a vegetarian for ten years, but eventually returned to eating meat. I started with fish, then started eating poultry, and eventually began eating red meat as well.  I am still not a big meat eater.  I started eating meat again because my diet had become very predictable and limited.  I was eating the same thing - pasta, rice, etc. - all the time.  I think that my body was craving some variety.      I admire vegetarians who can stick to it and cook creatively.  It helps if you live in an area with many vegetarian options at restaurants.    Another factor in going back to eating meat was the acceptance/realization that eating meat is a part of human nature.  I used to genuinely believe that I could influence people to give up meat, and that eventually everyone would be vegetarians.  I eventually gave that idea up.      Humans are blessed with intelligence and the ability to make their own choice regarding diet.  A person can follow a vegetarian diet and be perfectly happy and healthy.  However, most people enjoy the taste of meat and crave it, so the human race as a whole will continue to eat meat.  In addiiton, some people have no choice but to eat meat, depending on where they live.    Personally, I have never heard of a diet that allows you to eat seafood any time and red meat for only four hours.  What are your reasons for following this diet?  Is it related to the digestive cycle?  I can't imagine a moral justification for that restriction.|`|b9uOax0aaa	I did not give up meat.  Almost a rant isn't it.|`|AA11173395	I don't eat meat for environmental and health reasons.  I am not a Christian.    From your rant I would say that you seem very confused.  Perhaps because consumption of meat inhibits digestion, which inhibits circulation, which has a negative effect on brain activity.|`|7E2kGw2naa	Whether or not something is natural has nothing to do with whether or not it is ethical, this is called the naturalistic fallacy.  I can give you a few examples to illustrate my point:    Natural, considered unethical by most people:  -Mating with every woman you see.  For men, more mating = higher fitness, this is why men always want to mate with everyone.  -Murder. People have been murdering each other for a very long time, and non-human animals kill each other in nature.  -Rape.  Again, people have being doings this for a long time and it is common to observe this in non-human animals in nature.    "Unnatural," ethically neutral:  -Using a computer.  -Driving a car.  -Riding a bike.  -Using a cell phone.    "You don't know their kid, you'll feel sorry, but there is no attachment so you can't cry for it."    This is a different situation.  Rather than not crying for someone else's child, eating meat is more like killing their child.  You are responsible for animals' deaths, and whether or not you feel bad about it has nothing to do with whether or not it is ethical.  Don't confuse ethics with emotions.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I gave up meat because I am an animal lover - it would have been hypocritical not to.    I became vegan and am not and was never a Christian.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	I gave up meat because it disgusted me, plain and simple. And yes, animals eat other animals, just like there are plenty of animals who don't. The difference between us and other omnivores is that they HUNT other animals. Their prey has a chance at life. The meat industry is a different story; animals are bred to die and suffer indescribable atrocities in the process. I want no part of that.    And as for religion, no I'm not a Christian or anything else. Religion is a hoax on humanity and everyone seems to be buying in. If I went around proclaiming that Hans Christian Anderson's stories were the absolute truth and really happened, people would be locking me up.|`|v2CHaD7Xaa	I am a Christian and not a vegetarian, although have been cutting back on my meat consumption as my cholesterol has been getting higher.

I have no specific beliefs but i can sleep better at night knowing that I'm not eating something that came from another living creature. I think it's gross. Also, I'm addicted to soy milk and cook/baking I would have never discovered my talent for it had I remained a vegetarian let alone a meat eater.    I guess I am compassionate about animals though...but being a Pisces it's said to be in our nature and I believe all that astrological stuff.    And yeah I'm said to be christian but I believe in polytheism, well, open theism...concepts from other religions make sense to me, orthodox Rastafarian's are vegetarians some Hindus, and Buddhists are vegans I haven't really read that far into their concepts of vegetarianism or veganism in their religions but it exists so...I guess all religions contradict themselves along with others.    Also, I'd like to point out that although eating meat is human nature the cave man, didn't have factory farming or mass production of meat. I've developed the idea that back in the 1800s or even the early 1900s (discluding butcher shops) people couldn't walk into a McDonald'ss or a grocery store and find meat-lined aisles of food. You had to hunt for your food berries nuts fruits and vegetabless were the main source of nutrients so if you wanna talk about human nature go out and hunt a pig or a cow or bull...a buffalo whatever.

Serve with white rice.<br>  <br>  (for every two pounds of shrimp, i usually use 2 bunches of scallions, one red and one orange bell pepper, one cup of crushed pineapple with some of the juices, one cup of the sweet and spicy sauce and about one cup of coconut, but its all about your personal taste)<br>  <br>  <br>  and you can also try<br>  allrecipes.com <br>  cookinglight.com <br>  epicurious.com<br>  CDKitchen.com|`|iHFZLsDTaa	Mayo Clinic healthy recipes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes/RE99999" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy...</a>|`|BLTo4xL9aa	why don't you try to search on the internet of what is the best healthy food...or. you can try to read on the books or magazine. and., be understand of what information they have.|`|1g5ogETXaa	I always do a search on www.cookinglight.com when I am looking for something healthier.

2zHq2XIMaa	I'm sure it's probably stress or something, and your hair could even be falling out to renew itself with better cleaner folicles. This can happen when you drastically change your diet.     But you could be lacking vitiman a - dark green leafy veg. Or you could be missing b12 - take some supplements or foods fortified with b12. like tofu and soy milk and some cereals.    Good luck|`|NNiN0tK0aa	You can easily get enough protein from a vegan diet, but if you're losing hair, it sounds like you're not getting enough.  Vegetables aren't a good source of protein except dark leafy greens.  These contain complete protein equal to meat, they are the staple food of nature's vegetarians - gorrilas eat leaves and have huge muscles, cows eat grass and grow huge bodies.  However it is difficult for human vegans to eat enough greens for their protein needs because greens are a) expensive and b) a lot of people don't like them.  Wild greens - weeds - are free, and you can add some like chickweed to salads.  Most are very tough, impossible to chew raw, and taste very bitter, but if you cook them they become soft and pleasant-tasting and you can use them like spinach.  Find a book on wild foods so you know what to pick (some weeds are poisonous).  Most people can recognise nettles and dandelion and dock leaves and they're extremely good for you.  Nettle is known from improving hair health and dandelion is a brilliant liver booster, both are also full of iron.  Seaweed is nutritionally very similar to greens, so also an excellent free protein source.    For cheap foods you can buy - you need to combine legumes (lentils/beans/chickpeas/peanuts) with wholegrains to make a complete protein.  Or soya or quinoa are complete all by themselves.  Hence most vegan processed foods are made from soya.  Buy soya meat, or have meals containing both legumes and grains.  For example:    Beans on toast  Hoummus (chickpeas and sesame) on Pitta Bread  Lentil Dhal with Rice  Lentil Bolognaise with Pasta  Peanut butter on Rice Cakes  Bean Chillie and Rice  Bean Hotpot with Bread  Bean Stew with Dumplings  Chickpea pie with wholewheat pastry.    It's a myth that vegans replace meat with vegetables.  They replace it with legumes+grains, and also nuts and seeds.  Raw vegans replace it with greens, but that is really expensive.|`|AA11702470	I also have noticed my hair thinning, and eat a primarily vegan diet. I read just yesterday in "First" magazine, that a deficiency in B vitamins can lead to hair thinning in some people. It might be worth looking into.|`|e598a4a2cc577e31e93cb794b800a568aa	been a veggie/vegan for more than 25yrs.  was personally born with VERY thin hair, started the veggie thing at about 17yrs old.  one of the 1st things i did was to research how to make my hair thicker & more healthy as i was on swim team & surfed every day.  and the ocean washed up the best thing for hair.......  Seaweeds!!!  i am not so sure why but the more i ate the less my hair required trimming due to split ends & my hair did get noticeably a bit thicker, could never get it to grow past my shoulders, now many yrs down the line , my hair is just above my behind & my heart meds make my hair fall out, AAAARGH!  back to basics, MORE seaweed!  and again it has really helped.  oh & i never took birth control, too many animals suffered through testing.  used Self-Control.  maybe the combo of diet change & birth control has contributed to your current hair loss.  well hope this helps.  =>:)|`|agTCqkLDaa	I would see a doctor.    I know this is hard to take, but not everybody is meant to be a vegan/vegetarian.  There are some people whose bodies can handle it and other people whose bodies can't.    I was a vegetarian for several years until my body said "Nope, no more" and now I eat meat (not a lot and mostly fish), but I had gone to the doctor and tried everything they recommended.  When that didn't work, I just faced the fact that I had one of those bodies that couldn't adapt to vegetarianism.

a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	My suggestion is to first read, read, read. I bought a bunch of books from amazon.com and learned about as many different approaches and philosophies on raw food as I could. Some books say transition slowly, some say dive right in. I say read about both and choose your own path. <br>  <br>  I do recommend Natalia Rose's book "The Raw Food Detox Diet" for transition advice, but it certainly isn't the end-all be-all. Check out the Boutenko family, Shazzie, Ani Phyo, Alissa Cohen, Gabriel Cousens, etc. They all have different advice. None of it is perfect but all of it is valuable. <br>  <br>  I love goneraw.com for recipes. <br>  <br>  I think a blender is essential. Sharp knives, too. A juicer (I suggest Omega 8003, I loooooove mine) , food processor, and a spiralizer come in handy. You will be tempted to buy a dehydrator. Do it if you really want to, but I honestly don't use mine that often. If you do get one, get a nice one. But no matter what, get yourself a blender!|`|VdbhuUYBaa	Nice cut and paste answer from lazy Justin (and the 50 other names he/she uses). That's our pet troll (neutered). He's had a clinical anti-veger obsession since last May, minimum. Rants and rolls, smokes dope and trolls. You can see from the answer he gave he's arguing with some imaginary person or maybe one of his multiple personalities? He's pretty much the laughing stock of the V&V because vegers and meat eaters alike laugh AT him, not with him. He is NEVER to be taken seriously and I'm a meat eater myself.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, the best advice is to do real research to make sure you are meeting all of your nutrition requirements and don't let people like our troll discourage you. Just be glad you aren't him and turn the page.|`|HVM5aXa8aa	Make sure you are well educated on what nutrients you receive from each type of food, and how to combine foods to receive complete protein, and enough vitamins and minerals.  It is possible to be healthy on this diet, but it takes a lot more work, because your options are much more limited.  I would probably take a multi-vitamin (I do take a multi-vitamin, and I am a vegetarian).

Such games are not difficult at the onset, but become much more challenging as the game continues as players become inebriated and their coordination and memory deteriorate<br>  <br>  Skill games<br>  Several games involve a skill such as scoring a ping-pong or darts. Players must have good aim throughout the entire game, even as they become increasingly inebriated. Examples of these games include Beirut, Pong, and Corners.<br>  <br>  Card games<br>  Several popular drinking games involving cards are asshole, connections, **** the dealer, horserace, Circle of Death, kings, liar's poker, Drawbridge Drinking Game, pyramid, ride the bus and Up the River, (Down the River) and Artichoke.<br>  <br>  Dice games<br>  Dice games include 7-11-doubles, beer die, dudo, kinito, kranen, liar's dice, mexico, mia, pounce!, ship, captain, and crew, tablero da Gucci, three man, and die of death.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tolerance games<br>  Tolerance games are about seeing which player can last the longest.

King Of The Pirates is a group-tolerance game.<br>  <br>  <br>   Movie games<br>  Movie drinking games are played while watching a movie (sometimes a TV show or a sporting event) and have a set of rules for who drinks when and how much based on on-screen events and dialogue. The rules may be the same for all players, or alternatively players may each be assigned rules related to particular characters. The rules are designed so that rarer events require larger drinks. Rule sets for such games are usually arbitrary and local, although they are sometimes published by fan clubs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Object Games<br>  Object games are usually simple games that involve using a random object in order to administer drinking "fines". Some good examples of object games are Pennying and the The Golf Ball Game.<br>  <br>  <br>  Miscellaneous games<br>  There are many other drinking games that cannot be categorized any certain way, such as never have I ever and the Vegetable Game.

v4vQSzu4aa	I hear ya, I'm pretty much over doing Beef Stew and Pot Roasts too, so here's a home recipe to help you get out of the "Winter Beef Blahs".  I made this a couple of weeks ago and it was heaven!<br>  <br>  Sear and brown the whole piece of Beef like you would to prepare it for Pot Roast. Then, dump in your Beef Stock, Worcestershire and seasonings and bring to a slow boil, then cook it until you can stick a fork all the way through it (fork tender) and it's practically falling apart.  Drain the beef stock and set aside.  Put the Chuck Roast in a large pan and then start pulling it apart with two forks, just like you would do for "Pulled Pork".  Saute up your onions and potatoes in butter. Then, once it is all shredded, you can mix it in with your small diced Potatoes (either ones you choose) and Onions (I like the Spanish White ones for this dish).  There is your Beef hash and I know it will be fantastic!  I made so much of my "pulled Beef", I made about 5 different dishes with it and it held well all week long.  Plus, I froze some as well.  So, I hope this home recipe doesn't confuse you and helps you to make your wonderful Beef hash!  Have a GREAT weekend!|`|SUxhqWPwaa	What I would do is put it in the freezer for a little bit until it gets a little hard and cut it up into pieces..Then roll it in a little bit of flour and turn your pan on med-high and fry the meat to get a crust on it...for about 6 or 7 minutes...Then I would put a few cups of water and a little gravy in the pan..bring to a boil and cut temp down to low and simmer for about 2 ans 1/2 hours that will get it really tender and soft...And then just add it to potatoes and you will have hash...Hope that helps you..|`|wG2AbAXEaa	This recipe calls for rump roast but I interchange all the time.

PJMXqlRjaa	I would suggest almond milk because almonds are calming for the stomach and are high in protein relative to rice milk. They also tend to have lower calories than rice or soy milk.  Rice milk may cause your blood sugar to spike more than almond milk (which is bad if you are trying to keep off weight) & rice milk is also higher in carbs than certain brands of almond milk.  I do not suggest soy milk because it contains soy which is a phytoestrogen. If you are trying to build up muscle mass, stay away from soy milk, because it contains enzymes which will not allow for efficient muscle production. Make sure you are not allergic to almonds, though, before drinking almond milk. Never attempt to make almond milk by yourself at home with "bitter almonds", because mixing almonds with water can release cyanide.|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	There's obviously pros and cons for each one: <br>  <br>  <br>  Soy Milk: Swimming in Controversy<br>  <br>  If you want to know whether or not soy milk is good for you, it really depends on who you ask. The Food and Drug Administration has been touting the benefits of soy for a healthy heart. In 1999 they approved the health claim:<br>  <br>  "Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease."<br>  <br>  The claim was approved after the FDA determined that "four daily soy servings can reduce levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), the so-called "bad cholesterol" that builds up in blood vessels, by as much as 10 percent."<br>  <br>  The American Heart Association agrees, and recommends that soy products (like soy milk) be used in a diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, and lean meats.<br>  <br>  That said, Kaayla Daniel, PhD, author of "The Whole Soy Story: The Dark Side of America's Favorite Health Food," believes soy estrogens can wreak havoc on hormones and more. She had this to say to one person on her Web site who said they got a lift from soy milk:<br>  <br>      "Check the ingredient list on your soy milk and you'll almost certainly find a lot of sugar. It might be named cane sugar, barley malt, rice sugar, fructose, corn syrup. Whatever, it's sugar. The most likely reason that you feel better after drinking your soy milk is that you are getting a sugar hit.<br>  <br>      The second possibility is that the soy estrogens are stimulating your thyroid. For some people this results in a mildly hyperactive thyroid with short-term energy gain. The down side is that over the long run your thyroid may go down, sinking into hypothyroidism. That means loss of energy, cognitive decline, brain fog. In my opinion the long-term risks of soy do not justify any short-term benefit."<br>  <br>  And then there's the taste.<br>  <br>  Ben Wasserstein, an associate editor at New York magazine, conducted a taste test on milk alternatives. Of the three soy milks tested, the highest average score was 3.6 (on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best). Tasters compared the drinks to "chalk," "a root," and "vegetabley."<br>  <br>  If you do opt for soy milk, most consumers recommend that you try a number of different brands before deciding on one you like (or dislike). Every brand tastes drastically different, as do flavors and varieties within brands. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Almond Milk: A Healthy Choice?<br>  <br>  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts you can eat. They're rich in magnesium, potassium, manganese, copper, the antioxidants vitamin E and selenium, and calcium. Almond milk, then, may be one of the more nutritious milk alternatives on the market.<br>  <br>  However, almonds are costly so the actual amount of almonds used in the almond milk is small; it may not be enough to give you lots of nutrition. You also need to watch out for additives and sweeteners in the milk.<br>  <br>  A solution may be to try your own homemade variety:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Grind one-quarter cup of almonds in a coffee grinder.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Combine almonds with one cup of water and blend in a blender for two to three minutes.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Strain the liquid using a sieve, if you like.<br>  <br>  But what about the taste?<br>  <br>  Consumers generally find the taste of almond milk pleasing. It has a light, nutty flavor. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Rice Milk: Mostly Carbs<br>  <br>  Rice milk is processed from brown rice and usually contains rice syrup, evaporated cane juice or some other natural sweetener. It is typically fortified with calcium or vitamin D.<br>  <br>  Rice milk is largely a source of carbohydrates, so it's important not to look at it (or either of the other two milk substitutes) as a nutritional replacement for milk (cow's milk is a source of protein, fat and carbs). Rather, it should be looked at as a useful replacement for milk for taste and cooking purposes, but to get the nutrients of cow's milk be sure you're eating a wide variety of other foods.<br>  <br>  And the taste? In Wasserstein's taste test, one variety of rice milk was tested. It received an average score of 4.0. Consumers said it tasted "oaty, but not" and "plasticky." <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  What's the Bottom Line?<br>  <br>  The milk alternative you choose is up to you:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        The health benefits of soy milk are highly debated. It may be good for you, or it may be harmful.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Almond milk may be healthful (but you're probably better off just eating the almonds).<br>      *<br>  <br>        Rice milk is largely a source of carbohydrates (but it can give you something to use with your meals and baking if you like the taste).<br>  <br>  The final decision comes down to personal preference and taste. If you can't drink milk, but miss it in your diet, check out the different varieties out there--and be sure you're eating a wide variety of healthy foods to go along with it.|`|MjBlti6Maa	I'm not entirely sure about what tastes better, but I know that Soy milk seems to be the lactose-intolerant standard, which seems to suggest that it's pretty tolerable as far as taste. But in terms of taste and healthiness, you might consider looking for Oat milk. I've never tried it, but I know people who have and they thought it tasted pretty good.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line the bottom of three 9-inch or two 10- inch cake pans with parchment paper rounds, grease with butter, and dust with flour (or spray with Baker’s Joy).<br>  Combine the butter, water, and canola oil in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, cocoa, and flour. Pour the butter mixture into the sugar mixture and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, then whisk in the buttermilk. Whisk in the baking soda, salt, and vanilla all at once. Transfer the batter to the prepared pans.<br>  For a 3-layer cake, stagger the cake layers on the oven racks so that no layer is directly over another. Set two layers on one rack and the third on the other.<br>  For a 2-layer cake, stagger the layers on the middle rack with one placed more toward the front of the oven and one toward the back.<br>  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of each layer comes out clean. Monitor the layers carefully for doneness; each one maybe done at a different time.<br>  Remove the cakes from the oven and cool on racks for about 15 minutes before inverting onto baking racks. Cool the cakes completely, at least 2 hours, before frosting.<br>  To make the frosting: Using a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cream in a large bowl on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and whip until thoroughly combined.<br>  Place 1 cake layer on a platter and spread some of the frosting over the top. Top with the remaining layer or layers, thickly coating the top and sides of each with frosting.<br>  Refrigerate the cake until the whipped cream frosting has stabilized, at least 1 hour.<br>  To make the glaze: Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it is very hot and just beginning to steam. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until it has melted completely. Stir in the syrup and vanilla. Pour the glaze into a medium pitcher or measuring cup and let cool for 10 minutes. Do not let the glaze sit longer because it will stiffen and become difficult to pour over the cake. Slowly pour the glaze over the cake, ensuring that it covers the top and drizzles down the sides. Cover the top of the cake entirely, but make sure some of the cream frosting shows through the drizzles on the sides. (If the glaze doesn’t flow easily over the edge of the cake don’t be afraid to add an extra tablespoon or two of Lyle’s Golden Syrup.)<br>  Refrigerate the cake until the glaze is set and the whipped cream frosting is firm, at least 1 hour. Slice the cake with a long serrated knife, dipping it in a tall glass of hot water between each slice. The refrigerated cake will keep for about 2 days.|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	Kasutera-Japanese Sponge Cake<br>  Kasutera is a sponge cake made of sugar, flour, eggs, and starch syrup. It is a speciality of Nagasaki Japan, but the cake is originally from Spain. The name is believed to derive from a region called Castilla. During the 16th century, a Portuguese ship came into Nagasaki, which used to be the port of Japanese commerce. The Portuguese brought the Japanese many unusual things such as guns, tobacco, and pumpkins. Kasutera was also one of the things they brought. Kasutera was able to be preserved for a long period of time so it was necessary for the sailors who were out on the sea for months. In the Edo era, it was a sweet that was precious and was served for the envoys from Korea. Later, Japanese people started making kasutera, and the cake's taste slowly changed to fit to the Japanese palate. This is the root of the kasutera in today's Japan.<br>  <br>  Kasutera is made of natural ingredients, so its simple taste is a favorite of many Japanese people. There are now many kinds of kasutera, made with various ingredients. For example, there are kasuteras made with powdered green tea, cocoa, and also brown sugar.<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br>  1/4 cup honey<br>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>  1 teaspoon lemon extract<br>  1/4 teaspoon salt<br>  7 large eggs, separated<br>  1 cup cake flour, sifted<br>  1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>  1 tablespoon green tea powder or unsweetened cocoa powder (optional-if using omit the lemon extract)<br>  <br>  Instructions:<br>  1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 C). Use parchment to line the bottom of a 10-inch tube pan, preferably with a removable bottom or 2 (8 x 4-inch) loaf pans. Grease the parchment. In a large bowl, whisk 1 cup sugar, honey, vanilla, lemon extract, and salt into egg yolks. Place bowl in a large pan of hot water. With an electric mixer, beat about 5 minutes on medium-high speed until pale yellow and doubled in volume. Gently fold in sifted flour.<br>  <br>  2. Wash beaters. In a large bowl, beat egg whites in electric mixer on a low speed 1 minute, increasing speed to medium-high. When foamy, sprinkle in 1 tablespoon sugar and cream of tartar. Beat until stiff but not dry. With a spatula, fold the egg whites in thirds. Pour batter into pan. Tap gently on the counter to remove air bubbles.<br>  <br>  3. Bake on middle rack of oven 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. When done, cake sides will pull away from pan slightly; top will be flat and feel spongy when pressed with finger. Cool 20 minutes. Run a small knife between edge of cake and pan. Remove from pan carefully. Pull off parchment and cool completely. Serve or store airtight.<br>  <br>  Makes 12-24 servings depending on which size cake pan you use.

llkSmgLJaa	It depends on what you eat. If you make rice, bean and pasta dishes you can save your parents money over what they pay to feed you now. <br>  <br>  Get the Vegetarian Starter Kit from - <br>  Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine<br>  <a href="http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/</a>|`|9ilXVowLaa	organic is more expensive but my preference.<br>  if you buy produce at the grocery you can always buy a veggie wash to clean them.<br>  locally grown produce is your best bet.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Eating healthy is always more expensive whether or not you include meats or not.  <br>  <br>  Fast food, fried food, prepared food, etc is always cheaper because it can be made in bulk and stored a long time - so it is cheaper than fresh.<br>  <br>  It isn't healthy - but sadly there is a correlation between poor diets and a person's income.  Poorer people can't afford better food - or the transportation needed to go get better food.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Organic produce can be costly but you can save money by buying a non-toxic produce wash for your fruits and veggies. Also eat what is in season b/c is it cheaper and shop at farmers markets when you can. With the faux meat products, usually I stock up when they are on sale.|`|KPqvL0Ojaa	nope cheaper actually if you know what to get. you can get fake ground meat that ill do like 6 meals for 3-4 dollars.  thats a cheaper than ground beef.  tofu is 2 bucks and does 5 meals, so yeah it should be fine|`|AA11296044	Not really, vegetables are quite inexpensive as are beans, soy products and grains.  All of which are staples of the vegetarian diet.|`|khXGGBiTaa	I don't find it expensive. For instance, when eating out at restaurants, the vegetarian-friendly main courses are quite often (not every time though) a dollar or so cheaper than the non-vegetarian main courses.<br>  <br>  I don't normally buy the "faux" products when I go shopping for food, so perhaps that is one major expense I'm missing out on. As someone else said, if you buy those, buy them in bulk when they're on special or reduced to clear.<br>  <br>  The cost of most foods has gone up, due to the cost of the fuel used to transport the products to the shops. Here in Australia, there is also the added cost due to the drought and other natural disasters. For instance, cyclones wiped out nearly all of the banana crops a few years ago, so the price shot up from the normal $2 per kilogram to about $12 per kilogram or more (for nearly a whole year) and it still occasionally goes up to about $6. Rather than pay that much, I just got used to not eating bananas.|`|4BNbc1ZIaa	Yes, it can be expensive if you aren't extra careful. However cheap veggies are, think about the price per a calorie of spinach verses chicken. If you're careful though and aren't picky, you can make out a vegtarian/ vegan budget thats actually cheaper than you're previous meat eating budget. <br>  <br>  Be sure to use plenty of beans, rice, potatoes, grits, & oatmeal as staples and then add on top of that. (They have high calories as far as veggie dishes go and at a low cost.)<br>  <br>  After that add soy products, vitamin fortified cereals, green leafy vegetables, and friuts to get your vitamins.<br>  <br>  For the rest of your calories, mix it up from day to day as not to get too bored and to get more nutrients. <br>  <br>  I would also recommend taking a good multivitamin that contains b-12, calcium, & vitamin D - especially if you go all the way to vegan.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Last but not least, try to limit the immitaion meats as those can be twice as expensive as real meat and your parents may put they're foot down.<br>  <br>  Best of luck... and you might want to look ito being a complete vegan if it's animal welfare you're worried about. The dairy cows and egg laying chickens get treated just as bad as the ones for slaughter.|`|c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	Chicken breasts- 3.99 a pound (about $7 for 4 breasts)<br>  Beans- 1.99 a bag<br>  <br>  My husband is not a vegetarian, I am a vegetarian and my food always costs less then his food. Where being a vegetarian gets to costing a little more is with meatless items. You can get your protein from other sources like beans, cottage cheese, and tofu though. <br>  <br>  Also offer to help your parents out by shopping for thing on sale and looking for coupons for these items on the web. (most websites will have some coupons.) <br>  <br>  Also offer to cook a filling and healthy vegetarian meal one night a week for the family that will cut the household budget, and give the family cook a break. <br>  <br>  This should help you start to look at being a vegetarian. Keep an eye on your protein, and your iron levels if female.|`|SCD6Pdtnaa	It depends how you change your diet.<br>  <br>  If you just switch to veggie burger instead of meat burger, tofu dogs instead of hot dogs, then it will be about the same and can get more expensive.<br>  <br>  I recommend trying out pastas, stir fries, casseroles, etc. that use beans, nuts, and quinoa (a grain that is very high in protein). Beans and nuts are way cheaper than meat.<br>  <br>  Get a few cookbooks and try out some recipes. I recommend "How it All Vegan" (vegan, not vegetarian) to start - the recipes are all really easy, often cheap, and with ingredients that you can find in the average grocery store. Even if you start with one veggie meal a week, you'll be able to get a sense for what kind of options are available to you. You can get cookbooks from the library, too, so you can try them out and find recipes that you like, and then just buy the ones with the most recipes that are your cooking style/budget.|`|0ectWZxAaa	No, It is not any more expensive than buying meats.<br>  <br>   For me I use fake meats as staples. And you can get a package of fake burgers fake corn dogs, fake bacon, fake chicken (whatever floats your boat) for about 3 bucks.<br>  <br>   Not only that but pastas, rice, beans and veggies/fruit are cheaper than eating steak and chicken every night. My grocery bills are about the same as they were before when I ate meat.|`|6CjDTJskaa	Well if you want organic produce then it may be a bit more costly, but if you want to eat just regular produce or vegetarian food i think so far, out of my bank account i have taken less money out for groceries than before just buying salads, nuts, tofu, fruits, and other veggies etc. in other words i would say they it is a bit cheaper.|`|8EH4gFwbaa	Lol. I'm a vegetarian too, just for about the same reasons.<br>  <br>  Yup produce and other things are pretty expensive..I told my mom i was gonna do that and she suddenly went to the store to buy all those things. If your parents are "cheap", then look around for a store that sells cheap.|`|sM9JQBG0aa	if you are eating organic then yes it can be, but just regular veg is about the same i find, you dont spend much on expensive meat and stuff but you will find yourself going to buy stuff often because it veg food goes by fast|`|GYSxsQOqaa	Hmm.... I think it's a little more expensive because you have to buy special vegetarian foods. I'm a vegan and it is a little more expensive but it is sooooo worth it. But a vegetarian diet might be cheaper than a meat eating diet. Come on, don't let a LITTLE money get away from saving animals, THE PLANET, and you body!!!
yezbmlaKaa	Vicodin stays in ones system for at least twelve hours. It may be harmful to your liver to use vicodin and drink alcohol as well.

KWhKwgsSaa	Back in the day, we didn't have ready made taco shells and had to actually fry corn tortillas.  I am not kidding -- when I was growing up that was the only way you could have them, to fry them your self.  In a medium sized frying pan, add about 1 to 2 inches of oil, heat to about 350 degrees.  Using tongs, place one side of the tortilla in the hot oil, and use your tongs to hold the other side in place in order to form the shape.  Once the side submerged in the hot oil is crisp, flip the tortilla to fry the other side of the shell.  Drain on paper sacks or paper toweling.<br>  <br>  They taste much better than the packaged stuff.|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	Cut them into triangles and deep fry them.|`|288251fd9000ef121301a956a76145e7aa	Turning Corn Tortillas Into Taco Shells<br>     <br>  Ingredients<br>  prepared corn tortilla <br>  oil (for frying) <br>  Directions<br>  1Heat oil over medium heat in a skillet. <br>  2Carefully add half of the tortilla (folded into a taco shape) and fry until golden (you will need to hold up the tortilla half the entire time.). <br>  3Using tongs, carefully flip the tortilla to fry the other side until golden (continue holding the free edge to maintain the shape). <br>  4Remove from skillet and balance the shell (Teepee style) on a paper towel until set. <br>  5Repeat, placing each made taco shell on top of the last to drain oil and set. <br>  6After they are all set, you can pile on the taco goods and enjoy!|`|V5Mw6rUtaa	I use a deep fryer and two aluminum/metal coland strainers that fit inside eachother.<br>   I<br>   place the flour tortilla in between the strainers ( to form a bowl shape) and deep fry for about 30 seconds. <br>  <br>  Be careful. and good luck. <br>  <br>   If you dont have  the two strainers you can hold the shell down in the center with a pair of tongs. wear oven mitts so you dont get splatter burns.|`|AA11786341	just fry at medium-hot for 30 seconds or so,<br>  <br>   flip and do the same...<br>  <br>  then transfer to a napkin and 'fold and hold' just long enough for the shell to conform to taco size or thereabouts...usually not long. <br>  <br>  This is just great with fresh corn tortillas.

AA11317670	You can find rambutans in any Asian supermarket they usually have them canned in a light syrup and if you live near a Chinatown area you can find them fresh in the summer when they are in season and you could also look for lychees they are a cousin of the rambutan and almost similar in taste. I've had them in Honduras but they confuse them with it's cousin the lychee so they grow in Spanish countries as well as Asian ones so you might try asking for lychees as well.|`|kChWswkAaa	Rambutans are Oriental fruits (I just don't know if they have these in other Asian countries).  You can find them in Chinese and Filipino Supermarkets.  I am not sure if you can find them in any other South-east Asian supermarkets like Thai, Viet, Korea, etc.

If you are making ice cream, that would be your milk mixture, if you are making sauce, it is whatever liquid you are using.<br>  Start by splitting the bean in half, lengthwise. Turn the knife over and with the dull, top of the knife shank (use a small paring knife) scrape the inside of the bean from one end to the other as smoothly as possible. You will end up with a lump of brownish, blackish stuff which are the seeds. Scoop it up and whisk it into you liquid. You will see very quickly that it breaks up into that recognizable vanilla bean look. Tiny black seeds suspended in cream...<br>  If you don't plan to use them right away, store them in the freezer. They take only a few minutes to thaw and will last much longer this way.|`|18f46c8203c14c3ecfd37224796c98bdaa	This vanilla sugar makes a nice gift, or use it to make desserts or flavor coffee.<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS:<br>  1 vanilla bean<br>  3 cups granulated sugar<br>  <br>  PREPARATION:<br>  Add 1 vanilla bean cut in 1-inch pieces to 3 cups of white granulated sugar.

At one point in time it referred to "White Hots", but not so much now. <br>  <br>  Coney Island Dogs have coney island meat sauce (like a beanless chili), diced onions  and mustard on them. Once in a while I have seen saukraut and/or cheese added to all that as well. <br>  <br>  This is the sauce my family uses for our Coney Dogs, none of us really measure it anymore, so I am guessing at amounts<br>  <br>  1lb ground beef<br>  1/2tsp salt<br>  2 Tbsp chili powder<br>  pinch of cayanne<br>  pinch of paprika<br>  dash of oregano<br>  1 1/2 cups tomato sauce<br>  2/3 cup water<br>  <br>  Brown the meat and drain off the grease, then mix everything else in (takes some time to combine so the water and sauce arent separate), bring to a boil, then turn down and cover and let it simmer for 45 minutes to and hour. <br>  <br>  It takes care of at least a dozen dogs, so I tend to make a batch, split in half, cool one half and freeze, use the other half.

iHFZLsDTaa	Here are two recipes for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/search?q=pizza+size+chocolate+chip+cookie+" rel="nofollow">http://www.cooks.com/rec/search?q=pizza+...</a><br>  |`|AA10020034	Yes, it's a great idea for any kind of cookie dough...tube, mix, or homemade. In your case, mix as directed, then press into the sprayed pan with your fingers until it is even and comes about 1/2 in from the edge of the pan all the way round (because it will spread a little). It shouldn't be more than a quarter to half inch thick, any thicker means you have too much dough...so depending on the size of your mix you have to judge how big the cookie will be. If you don't really have enough dough...make the cookie smaller, not thinner.<br>  <br>  FYI This is a great beginning to a fruit pizza...use sugar cookie dough! Shortcuts like mix or tube dough make it so easy. |`|bLTKq1tfaa	I've actually done this and it's fab! Plus you can personalize it and cut it up into pieces to make it look like a shape. I guess you could with store bought ones but I like making it on my own because I laugh chocolate chip cookie cakes. On the box there should be a chocolate chip cookie cake temp. You make it on whatever you want, we use a pizza pan but you could use a square one if you wanted in a box instead of a circle. <br>  <br>  Here's a website that actually helps you make it from scratch but since you're using a box mix you can probably just do the time they said at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes. They said a little less if you like it chewy in the center. <br>  <a href="http://buttercakes.squarespace.com/blog/2008/9/21/chocolate-chip-cookie-cakes.html" rel="nofollow">http://buttercakes.squarespace.com/blog/...</a>

Put it in the refrigerator overnight and take it out in the morning - punch it down - form into rolls - let them rise till almost doubled in size and then pop them into a hot oven where they will finish rising and bake to perfection.  I used to teach bread baking classes at the local community centre when I had 3 children under the age of 4 @ home.  I made one batch the night before the class (so I would have something to work with when I got to class) made one batch in the morning ( that would rise during the class and be formed into buns or loaves) and one batch of dough at the class (so the ladies could see the kneading technique).  Your house will smell wonderful and your family will come to expect it every time they come over - are you sure you want to start this?  ;- )

sKmQVwQMaa	Cheese is a food made from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep, by coagulation. The milk is acidified, typically with a bacterial culture, then the addition of the enzyme rennet or a substitute (e.g. acetic acid or vinegar) causes coagulation, to give "curds and whey".[1] Some cheeses also have molds, either on the outer rind (similar to a fruit peel) or throughout.|`|QvrlOMPKaa	Milk.<br>  they make it out of milk an then they do something like heat it up then do this that freeze...|`|N0d6HKmUaa	dearie, search in wikipedia

LAZRQ86uaa	Dans un smoothie tu mets très peu de lait ou 1 peu de yaourth ou 1 peu de jus de fruit afin d'avoir la consistance que tu veux, cela n'a rien à voir avec un milk shake car un milk shake c'est de la glace et du lait, et rien à voir non plus avec du yaourth à boire qui lui est liquide alors qu'un smoothie est assez épais et très onctueux.<br>  Perso cela fait 8 ans que je m'en prépare après avoir découvert ?a en GB, et la dominante sont les fruits, j'utilise environ 80% de fruits et parfois 90%, j'aime quand la texture est bien onctueuse donc très peu de lait ou jus de fruits dedans, je rajoute parfois aussi des céréales ou du muesli: c'est super bon !<br>  Dans les milk shake, les fruits sont quasi inexistants, tout comme dans le yaourth à boire.<br>  <br>  Il faut se les faire soi même, il ne me viendrait jamais à l'idée d'en acheter des tout prêt, au moins je sais d'où viennent mes fruits et  je peux faire les mélange que je veux !|`|KD6p4Ljwaa	Les smothies sont une nouvelle mode, il y à rien de neuf sous le soleil.

Heres a simple fried rice recipe in case you wanted one.<br>  <br>  1. Get out a Wok or a frying pan and head some oil on it.<br>  <br>  2. Chop up some garlic into small bits (how much depending on how much rice you have, you decide). Add it to the oil and fry it till fragrant.<br>  <br>  3.This is up to your preference. If you want you can add chicken/pork and fry till cooked. (If you do not want any meat skip to step 5.<br>  <br>  4. Add about one or two table spoons of oyster sauce to the chicken and let it simmer for about 5 minutes (it will act as a marinade).<br>  <br>  5. Add in your refrigerated steamed rice (don't have to microwave it, you can take it out straight from the fridge and add it to the frying pan).<br>  <br>  6. Fry it all the ingrediants to gather and than add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce (depending how salty you want it).<br>  <br>  7. Add in 1 egg and mix it around till the egg is cooked, after that add in whatever vegetables you want. (for a simple meal i usually just add in frozen peas, carrots and corn). When you sure everything is fried up than you're good to go and ready to serve.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!<br>  <br>  (refrigerated steamed rice is perfect for fried rice because of the dry texture it gets from being in the fridge).

You should check to make sure there is enough water about 1/2 way through. You can do this by picking up the pressure cooker by the lid and swirling the contents. If it seems there is still water you're ok, if not release pressure valve and remove cover, then add more water. <br>  6After approx 1 hour, remove the lid, and add the smen. Mix well. Also add the olives at this time. Continue cooking with the lid off until a thick sauce has been created. This should not be watery but have some consistency to it. The chicken should be almost falling off the bone. <br>  7Turn out the meat and olives to a serving plate. In Morocco this is eaten from a common plate using flat bread as utensils.

CnBMe52naa	corn meal|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	When times were hard, the people of Northern Italy needed to find something which would sustain them while working in the fields. They started finding creative ways to make a food staple which would keep the belly full for the day. It is this reason that polenta is known as a poverty food. The Italian cooks would grind wild grains and cook the "grits" with water, to make a porridge-type dish. Buckwheat was one of the grains which was popular because of the distinct flavor it added to the dish. When corn was brought to Italy, the people started making the polenta with the ground corn. Today's popular dish was born. <br>  <br>  There are some simple ways to prepare polenta at home without all the work and constant stirring. The traditional way to prepare this dish is to bring 2 quarts of water and 1 teaspoon of salt to a boil. Once the water is at a rapid boil, the chef adds 1 pound of cornmeal. The mixture must be stirred the entire time it is cooking. This keeps lumps from forming and also keeps the mixture from burning. There are few people who have the time to devote to this method of preparation. The best, and easiest, way to prepare polenta is to add the water, salt and cornmeal into a crock pot. Turn the slow cooker on low and allow the mixture to cook overnight. The result is a soft polenta which can be used in any recipe. <br>  |`|1fb8ccf3a83eb3a41ca2d8616f867323aa	a special type of yellow cornmeaL, lightly simmered with water for about 45 minutes-it is more commonly known as cornmeal mush!|`|GT6396BDaa	Polenta is cornmeal, very similar to grits.  |`|3gH7jFJGaa	boiled cornmeal|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	just cornmeal, i'm making some for lunch|`|nXdTWCGYaa	Cornmeal

llkSmgLJaa	It depends on who your living with. After India, China is probably the most vegan/vegetarian friendly country on earth. I would ask to be placed with a vegetarian/vegan family.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Hope you like other things than meat.  Might try dog and cat and of course rice and many veggies.  I love chinese veggies and rice too.|`|khXGGBiTaa	It's going to be very difficult.<br>  <br>  The Chinese tend to eat anything that moves and anything that doesn't move. And what they don't consider as food, they will often use as medicine instead (What we in the West call Chinese "herbal" medicine includes almost as much animal-based products as it does plant-based).<br>  <br>  There may be a lot of Chinese Buddhists, but Buddhism is, sadly, not equivalent to vegetarianism. Buddhist monks and nuns in different parts of the world might be vegetarian, but the majority of lay Buddhists are not vegetarian, or they are only "vegetarian" one day or one week per month. As far as I know vegetarianism is not an element of Taoism or Confucianism, the other two major religions or philosophies in eastern China. In far western China, Islam is one of the major religions, and that is practically anti-vegetarian.<br>  <br>  Rice is the staple food in most of China, especially the south. In the north, you may also find millet and wheat. I don't know what it's like in China itself, but once I ordered a plain rice dish (in a Chinese restaurant) that I assumed was going to be edible, but when it arrived, it had egg in it. (I'm a lacto-vegetarian, not an ovo-lacto-vegetarian, so I just sent it back.) If you're going to be in Hong Kong, you should be pretty safe. There are still a few Indian restaurants there, left over after the hand-over of the former British colony to Chinese control. Of the Chinese restaurants, there are a few you might be able to trust, if they speak good enough English there. One thing to watch out for is when they cook bok choy or similar leafy vegetables, most Chinese restaurants will cook it in oyster sauce.<br>  <br>  Good luck, if you're going. I don't think I could do it.|`|PDotv2Hsaa	Not difficult. There're a lot of greens in a Chinese diet and you'd have a variety of greens and mock meat plus rice or noodles.<br>  <br>  When you go to a restaurant, just order the vegetable dishes and let the order taker know that you're vegetarian in case they accidentally fry it (especially noodles) with pork lard.|`|AA11296044	Buddhism is still one of the major religions in china, this translates into many establishments would be offering a vegetarian/vegan friendly menu as devout buddhists are generally vegan.|`|lMH2cA1kaa	It should be easy nowadays, especially in large cities like Beijing and Shanghai.|`|YyQHF5KAaa	i dont know but dont eat any meat because they eat cats and dogs

Soak, pulling noodles apart and stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Drain noodles and cut into 2- to 3-inch pieces (you should have about 3 cups), then transfer to another large bowl.<br>  <br>  Put mushrooms in a bowl and cover with hot water by several inches. Soak 15 minutes. Drain and rinse mushrooms thoroughly, then drain again. Trim off and discard any hard parts from mushrooms. Finely chop mushrooms. (You should have about 2 cups.) Add to noodles.<br>  <br>  Pulse shallot and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped, then add to noodles along with carrots, pork, fish sauce, sugar, pepper, and salt. Pulse shrimp in processor until coarsely ground. (Do not overprocess or it will become pasty.) Add shrimp to noodle mixture. Mix with your hands until well combined. Chill filling, covered with plastic wrap, until cold.<br>  <br>  Assemble rolls:<br>  Line 2 trays with wax paper.<br>  <br>  Transfer one fourth of filling to a small bowl and keep remainder chilled, covered. Place 1 wrapper on a work surface, keeping remaining wrappers covered with a clean kitchen towel (to prevent them from drying out). Cut wrapper diagonally in half to form 2 triangles. With long side of 1 triangle nearest you, put 2 tablespoons filling along middle of long edge of triangle, and shape filling into a thin 5-inch log. Fold left and right corners of wrapper over filling, overlapping slightly and aligning bottom edges. (Wrapper will resemble an open envelope.) Dab top corner with yolk, then roll up wrapper away from you into a long thin roll, making sure ends stay tucked inside. Place on a tray, seam side down. Repeat with remaining triangle. Make more rolls in same manner with remaining wrappers and filling, keeping trays of rolls chilled, loosely covered, until ready to fry.<br>  <br>  Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a 5- to 6-quart pot over moderately high heat until it registers 365°F on thermometer. Fry rolls in batches of 5 or 6, keeping rolls apart during first minute of frying to prevent sticking, until golden brown and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. (Return oil to 365°F between batches.) Transfer as fried to a colander lined with paper towels and drain rolls upright 2 to 3 minutes. To eat, wrap hot or warm rolls in lettuce leaves and tuck in mint and cilantro leaves.

As far as heart health all alcohol (yes booze included) helps to reduce cardiac disease. The beers (credit to the craft industry or real ale producers anywhere) which use a higher amount of hops & malt have vitamins and minerals that help in many areas of health improvement. Yet these considerations are for moderate usage only. For women no more than 2 per day and men more than 3 per day.|`|clJTTYJXaa	Alcohol's a natural blood thinner and reduces the chance for blood clotting n stroke n whatnot.

Research continues to show antioxidants' ability to prevent cell damage that may lead to cancer and heart disease. Significant quantities of polyphenols are found in beer. Preliminary research suggests that several polyphenols found in hops may have the ability to slow the growth of cancer cells in test tubes and enhance cancer-fighting enzymes. One polyphenol in particular, xanthohumol, is found only in hops and is believed to be a more potent antioxidant than vitamin E or genistein, a compound found in soy.|`|8wwuu00Paa	Can you stop spelling like a jackass and finish community college?|`|dA0kOHa7aa	ohhh yeaa, as soon it is not too much, you will be ok, experts say you should drink a couple bottles after you dinner and it will help your digestive system|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Nope its really bad for you.

You should have included further details and published it as an e-book.<br>  Don't ask her about it|`|mwEBrwlOaa	You are in the best position to answer that question. My feeling is if she does not remember anything and you do not notice any changes in her behavior then let it go. However if you notice she is becoming distant, not wanting to spend time with you, or is not making the time for you like she has in the past then I would approach her in a nonchalant way by asking her if there is anything wrong. At that point I would not bring up the party but I would let her discuss her feelings. If at that point she mentions the night I would be honest with her.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	I would not mention what happened. Instead, tell her what a great time you had with HER and how much fun it was to be with HER and how much you care about and appreciate what a cool and fun person SHE is. She knows what happened. You don't have to remind her about the sex. Just remind her that SHE is the one you care about. If she never wants to do it again, at least you will make her feel secure that you still like her and don't want other women to get in the way. If she wants to do it again, this will make her feel like it wasn't a bad idea and that you don't look down on her for doing it, because you told her how great and appreciated she is and that you are lucky to have her.|`|s4WywJ8baa	Sounds like you are just bragging...<br>  <br>  Is there a food or drink question in there somewhere?|`|UETAqR8Taa	say nothing, unless she brings it up|`|joQNkvDQaa	Why not ask her, and then you can fill her in on the details of what happened?   I myself have been in this position before, and waking up the next morning wondering what the hell happened last nite SUCKS.  It happens...no big deal.  But it would be good just to find out if she's aware, and she may like to know about it, just for her own future reference, and your relationship.  You don't want this creeping up on you to bite you in the butt later.|`|GrCj35muaa	I'm sure she remembers, she doesn't want to talk about it. don't bring it up, she will mention it when she is ready, you could risk a big fight if she doesn't remember.|`|VPksp6SQaa	Consider yourself luckY!<br>  <br>  <br>  don't say anything! :)|`|ABgwPfR7aa	Unless she says something about it, don't say anything!|`|trI88d8Gaa	1.Say NOTHING!<br>  2.Thank your lucky stars you have a girl like that.<br>  3.Take her out drinking more often.|`|tydulqH3aa	No, If it will happen again it has to be her plan,lay low.<br>  She knows what happened.|`|4JNyhT2gaa	Say Nada, let sleeping dogs lie!!|`|jkprjXMDaa	Heck no
xrRZeROmaa	It depends if the canned coconut was specified as flaked or shredded, in which case it is the same as bagged coconut.  If the recipe called for coconut milk , in a can, then no.  To substitute, you would need to put bagged coconut into a food processor,. and add water.  It would still not be a perfect substitute, but better than canned milk.|`|fc90038589392ee116a71db9a461a8f9aa	No! <br>  <br>  Canned coconut is like a thin sauce. <br>  <br>  Bagged coconut are usually shredded and dry, so they are not compatible in recipes.

Check out books from the library and read through them (ones with pictures are the most helpful).  Check out Wilton.com.  They have a lot of cake decorating tools and a few books.

Or take a class.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Most of us professionals in baking business use specific formulas for making cakes.    The cake must be firm and a bit on the dry side to stack and decorate properly. This means we use more flour and less liquid in the batter.    To decorate cake properly it absolutely cannot be one of the Betty Crocker or whatever very light fluffy moist cakes.    People usually complain that "bakery cakes' are too dry to eat. There is a reason they are drier than cakes you would bake at home. They are more stable if drier and don't fall apart as easily.    One lady brought back the cake she had purchased for her daughter's birthday party with one slice cut out and said it "must have been baked last week it is so dry and hard to cut", It had been baked the night before, decorated and set in the shelf for her to pick up at 9 am! She demanded her money back. I gave her her money back and never sold another cake to any one in her family. They were on a block listing. Yes, her sister was a good customer but couldn't buy cakes anywhere in town after that.    I cannot give you the formula for those cakes unless you want to make up batter for 25 pounds of cake! and all the ingredients are "scaled" anyway so if you don't have a scale my formula won't work.    Try some of the pound cakes recipes, from scratch rather than from mixes. They are firm enough to stand.|`|0Elxt7Yxaa	Cheesecakes:    http://hubpages.com/hub/Delicious-Cheese...|`|8QGt44O3aa	Be a professional|`|41Jwz5Bbaa	Go look online for a recipe, or go to a book store and get a book on how to bake a cake.|`|pv2r5kRSaa	go to a good cooking school or get a good cook book.

BWxSSADaaa	White basmati rice is a staple food, as is atta (a whole wheat) flour which is used to make the primary bread, called roti or chapati.  Lentils and beans are used and generally served at every meal (dhal).  Vegetables/fruits like onion, carrot, potato, tomato, eggplant, spinach, peas, cauliflower, cabbage are frequently used in curries.  Tomatoes, onion, cucumber, and fruits like mango and melon are eaten fresh.  Common herbs/spices/seasonings used are cilantro, coriander seed, mustard seed, cumin, fenugreek, cardamom, tumeric, chilis, black pepper, lemon juice, garlic, ginger and many, many others.  Dairy products are important, too.  A soft white cheese called paneer (farmer's cheese, basically) is often pressed and cooked in cubes in curries.  It may also be unpressed and used to stuff breads (parathas) or made into desserts (ras gulla).  It is kind of similar to ricotta when unpressed.  Yogurt/curd is often eaten with curries.  Nuts and coconut are used too, in some dishes (not just desserts).  For meats, beef is not consumed, but mutton, chicken, fish may be depending on the person and the region.  For example, my relatives live in Mumbai and they eat a lot of fish because it's right on the sea.  But in markets in Delhi, I saw lots of chickens.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	Rice and ladoo|`|YYAu9lFDaa	indian food|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Mainly curry based and lots of vegetarian food.|`|DXh2BlCraa	The native people of India eat fried vegetables and curries made of poultry and special sauces made of spices.

5zNwBQZHaa	Toss it.    The USDA says not to leave beef out at room temperature for more than 2 hours.      Smell, appearance and feel are not good indicators of early bacteria growth.  And if this is ground beef - it has more of a chance of being contaminated with nasty stuff on the inside than a steak.    Think about what the one pound of beef cost you - and then ask yourself if being sick is worth that amount of money?  Probably not.    So be safe - toss it and buy new.      USDA website on safe beef handling is at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Gro...  and there they say never to leave meat out at room temp for more than 2 hours.|`|IDBasYahaa	4 hours is the general standard rule according to food hygene experts on all food.  In terms of letting food sit on the counter overnight, if it was frozen, it's proberbly still ok.  Does it smell funky? Does it feel slimy? if the answer is no on both of those I'd risk it myself.

vcgn6XZgaa	ALWAYS refrigerate meat until you are ready to use it.|`|K5uoaetaaa	keep them in the fridge.|`|AA12127696	meat can rot if you leave them on the side to the fridge  it must go unless you marinate it with vinegar and soysauce you can leave it...|`|9EW08emXaa	If you have them out for a few minutes before cooking, that's fine. If you are seasoning them, go ahead and do that, and then you can either refrigerate them, or let them stand.  You won't want them out for long, so if you are preparing food to go with it that will take you a long time, put the meat back in the fridge until you are ready to cook them.|`|yYvFF2fDaa	Always keep the meat regrigerated. Pork will spoil really fast.     Something quick and easy.... shake and bake. it's yummy, moist and super fast to make. Just a thought for a not pro cook :)|`|KUYQ9IMHaa	It's okay to take them out of the refrigerator about 15 -20 minutes before you're going to cook them. At this point hit them with any seasoning you're going to use and let them come to room temperature.    This allows the chill to come off and they'll cook quicker and more evenly.|`|fxKhmQNraa	always in the fridge.  good luck|`|EcKLqBnCaa	If it's still frozen, you can keep it out for a few hours to let it thaw. If it's thawed out, you should let it sit out on the counter for a bit to let it get to room temperature, maybe 20 minutes. That's supposed to make it tender or something like that. I heard it on a cooking show, so I doubt it will kill you to do so.|`|c5701f3ddbef284fd6755e3722e83b6baa	Meat always cooks better at room temperature.  Leave them on the side for about 60-minutes.  Any longer than that, they should be put back in the refrigerator.|`|zXavPbXfaa	I would take them out of the fridge about 10 minutes or so before cooking to take the chill off.  Until then, leave them in the fridge.|`|fBxUaHn1aa	Yes, definitely put them in the fridge so that bacteria doesn't grow on them. It is ok however to let them sit out 30 minutes prior to cooking so you're not putting cold meat into a hot pan/grill/oven. That makes for more even cooking.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	What do you mean by n the side?    How long until dinner?    If you are going to be cooking them in about 30-45 min then no need to put them in the fridge. If it is going to be longer than that then yes put them in the fridge. Put take them out around 30-45 min before cooking them.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	refrigerate them when food becomes room tempature all the different kinds of bacteria can start to grow on them|`|AA11988604	refrigerate|`|53giV6PFaa	Put them in the fridge until about 15-30 minutes before you cook them.  That way they can get the "chill" off them.  I don't like cooking cold meats.|`|pckuIRhsaa	I would not leave them unrefrigerated over an hour while waiting to cook.

Traditional Texas chili has no beans|`|KWhKwgsSaa	I'm from Texas.  We don't put beans in our chili -- but I have seen other people on this site who also claim to be from Texas, and they do put beans in their chili.      Seems tomato based chili has beans, but beef based chili does not.  I make a beef based chili, no tomatoes and no beans.  It's a very old recipe (at least 100 years old) I learned from my granddad.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	I always put beans in chili; especially like different kinds of beans.

nOVSf06Raa	If the problem is diarrhoea give him rice to eat , we all have a different digestive system therefore it is difficult to know what is best and what's not , and if this person takes medication to cause this condition , you should talk to whomever give you the charge of caring for him about this they would be of help to you .|`|hT7BhNamaa	Bothered, if your giving your "man" all that stuff you mention of course he is going to have more movement than normal. It doesn't matter what he has, he could also me on a medication he must have with food. Is that the case?     You don't have to cook special meals for him, if your having crumbed chicken potato and beans, he can have that. He is having a slight mental problem at the moment, he isn't strange.

l9a8sFT7aa	I make a Chicken Mexicala that is great leftover if you want to try it: Here is the recipe:     you will need     4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cooked and chopped       * 1/2 cup chopped onion      * 1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers      * 1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk      * 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup      * 12 (6 inch) corn tortillas, quartered      * 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese      DIRECTIONS       1. In a medium saucepan, saute onion and green chiles until tender. Add to chicken.  Mix together the chicken, milk and soup. Heat through, mix well and set aside.     2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).     3. In a small skillet, saute tortillas a few at a time until soft. (If you do not want to saute, then just butter a stack of tortillas, appx. 8-12 and cut into fourths). Cut tortillas into quarters, then line a casserole dish or 8x11 inch baking dish with 1/2 of the tortillas. Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture over the tortillas, then layer with half of the cheese and remaining tortillas and remaining chicken mixture. Finally, sprinkle with cheese on top. Cover with foil.     4. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35-40 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	meatballs w/ rice, it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Uncle Ben's white rice    Progresso's Lentil soup poured over the rice.

Or a Lasagna?  or also Pasta,Tuna, Sweetcorn and Mayo..this always keeps cold in the fridge for the next day.|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Any casseroles, soups, or pastas will do.  Lasagna is really good for leftovers, and it's also good when company comes over.    For an easy soup, just get out some chicken/beef broth, put it in a pan or crock pot, chop up some vegetables and throw them in, and throw in a cup or so of rice or noodles.  If you want to add meat, cook the meat in a separate pan with whatever spices you want to use, then throw that in the pot, as well.  Add some spices to your taste, and you have a big pot of soup that will last you a while.  As you can imagine, you can vary this formula and make all kinds of soups easily.  And it seems like something you put a lot of work into, and it's low in calories.    Good luck!|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	Lasagna or spaghetti.. though we are having chicken quesadillas    Have a happy day!!

I'd like to recommend a tool on kraftfoods.com that can help you come up with some new ideas for dinner that don't require a trip to the grocery store.    The "Make it Now" tool lets you enter 3 ingredients, then you get suggested recipes that all have those ingredients. That way, your dinner recommendations make sense with what you have on hand or what you're craving.  You'll find the tool in the upper left hand side of this page:http://www.kraftfoods.com/kf/Dinner/    For example, if you enter "ground beef, rice and cheese" you'll get 17 ideas using these 3 ingredients. Good luck!
