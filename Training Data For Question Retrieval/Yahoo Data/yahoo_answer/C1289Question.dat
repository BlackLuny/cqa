20090309181703AAD9b2U	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	What are the main problems with the core accretion model and the disk instability model for the formation of t?	What are the main problems with the core accretion model and the disk instability model for the formation of the Jovian planets?   1   core accretion: needs a more massive disk than seems reasonable from other observations; gas instability: it is difficult to get the planets to grow fast enough at their current locations.   core accretion: is not able to produce the range of masses of the Jovian planets; gas instability: needs a more massive disk than seems reasonable from other observations.   core accretion: it is difficult to get the planets to grow fast enough at their current locations; gas instability: produces planets that are more massive than those actually observed.   core accretion: it is difficult to get the planets to grow fast enough at their current locations; gas instability: needs a more massive disk than seems reasonable from other observations.   core accretion: forms Jovian planets that contain too large a fraction of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium; gas instability: it is difficult to get the planets to grow fast enough at their current locations.
20090309181755AA9O1TE	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Extra-solar planets,..........?	a) What does the sample of known extra-solar planets tell us about the number of planets around other stars with masses and orbital radii similar to Earth's?   1   Very little, since most of the current searches for extra-solar planets are not capable of finding a planet resembling Earth.   Earth-like planets must be common since many planets are known with orbital radii of about 1 astronomical unit.   Earth-like planets must be rare since there are none in the current sample.         b) To image an extra-solar planet as a point of light, the best wavelength range to use is the infrared. The reason is that,   2   because of the properties of their atmospheres, planets reflect more infrared light than visible light.   the longer the wavelength used, the better the angular resolution of a telescope with a fixed aperture size.   relative to their stars, planets are brighter in the infrared than in visible light.

A company planning an advertising campaign to attract new customers wants to place a total of at most 10 ads in 3 newspapers.  Each ad in the Sentinel costs $200 and will be read by 2,000 people.  Each ad in the Journal costs $200 and will be read by 500 people.  Each ad in the Tribune costs $100 and will be read by 1,500 people.  The company wants at least 16,000 people to read its ads.  How many ads should it place in each paper in order to minimize the advertising costs?  What is the minimum cost?        I am pretty certain the answer is 2 ads in the Sentinel, 0 ads in the Journal, and 8 ads in the tribune; min cost is $1,200.

Some of these hydrocarbons are structural isomers.                  i) some of the hydrocarbons in petrol are alkanes. Write the molecular formula of an alkane that could be present in petrol.            c) X reacts with hydrogen and a nickel catalyst in the gas phase to produce compound Y, with the formula CH3(CH2)3CH2OH>             i) what is the systematic name of Y?                    ii) write an equation, including state symbols, for the reaction of X with hydrogen to form Y.            iii) Y has two structural isomers that are also position isomers. Name these two position isomers of Y.            iv) Y also has structural isomers with a different functional group. Write the structural formula of one of these isomers.      3 a) Crude oil is a mixture of many hydrocarbons. Fractional distillation can be used to seperate it into fractions which can be refined to produce hydrocarbons such as dodecane.           i) One molecule of dodecane contains 12 carbon atoms. What is the molecular formula of dodecane?           ii) what is the empirical formula of dodecane?           b) Decane, C10H22, is a straight-chain alkane. It reacts with chlorine in a radical reaction to form the compound C10H21Cl.           i) write an equation for the formation of chlorine radicals from cl2          ii) what type of bond fission is involved in the formation of chlorine radicals?         iii) How many different structural isomers can be produced when decane reacts with chlorine to form C10H21Cl?                 4) cyclohexane, C6H10, is manufactured by dehydration of cyclohexanol, C6H11OH, in the gas phase.           a) write an equation with state symbols for this process           b) Calculate the theoretical yield of cyclohexane from 10kg of cyclohexanol.           c) The actualy yield of cyclohexane from 10kg of cyclohexanol was 7.1kg.

Small breezes are ok, and as long as it's a sunny day, any amount of wind is good for me. However, i live Springfield, Ohio, and tomorrow Strong Thunderstorms and possible severe winds are predicted. I will be in school during that time, and the severe winds/thunderstorms will frighten me badly. Can anyone help me overcome this fear? Recently, a Tornado Indiana, and a flood happened north of here. I've never experienced either of those, but a Tornado is one of my worst fears in life, which is what causes my wind phobia, for i fear they might develope into a tornado, and ring me to my death(which probably won't happen). Even if a tornado does not form, the strong winds/thunderstorms still scares me. Any suggestions?

The Sun and the other stars in the disk orbit the center of our Galaxy. Assume that the Sun is 8 kiloparsecs from the center of the Milky Way and that its orbital velocity is 220 kilometers per second.    a. If the Sun is on a circular orbit around the center of the Galaxy, calculate how long it will take for the Sun to complete one orbit. Show your work! (If you're not sure how to do this, click on the Show your work link for instructions.)    b. If the Sun is 5 billion years old, calculate how many orbits the Sun has made around the Galaxy. Compare this number to the number of orbits the Earth has made around the Sun in the same amount of time.

20070528113520AArOXBY	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Does anyone ever wonder if the Tsunami could have...?	The Tsunami that happened on boxing day 3 years ago was said to have been caused by an earthquake in the ocean.   When I was watching live coverage of this event, I was perplexed by a certain interview during the reports.    Actually it was more than one person who had claimed to witness the sky lighting up very brightly in the dark of the early morning. They described a strange experience basically  just shy of saying they saw an astroid enter the atmosphere.   The claim was supported by several people on a live interview...this left me in a state of curiosity. I am familiar with the ideas involving under water earthquake related Tsunamis, and this event would be no different than other such related ones; However, I am also familiar some  of the dynamics of astroid impact and earth collisions with them.   My questions: Has anyone heard this interview? Has any body wondered about the validity of the "Under water Earthquake" story? Is there a likelyhood that an asteroid caused this Tsunami?

Please keep your replies civil enough for a public forum and take the question at face value without automatically assuming that the account is the result of inebriation, psychosis, or the fabrication of a wild imagination.      I have a friend that says that he has seen something strange in his apartment. He says he woke up after a power outage and got up to get a flash light and he saw, in the corner, a large glowing body of mist. He does not believe in disembodied spirits. However, he and I have been trying to explain it. There was another incident where he caught similar mist from the same corner of his apartment in a photo. Each time he has seen this it has been near the utility closet where the air conditioner and hot water reservoir are stored. Obviously, I am not an electrician or plumber. As such I am not certain what could be causing this, however I have a hunch. (see below)
20080925125919AA4Gyfq	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	I need some math food?	I'm in a science and match club, and we have snacks there, k?  last time we had gummy worms and gold fish because they sort of are related to biology.      Anyways, the math teacher couldn't think of any math food besides pie (pi).      I found some Leibniz cookies that are named after an independent inventor of calculus, and I'm cutting carrots into squares for square roots (aren't I clever =D)      But, yeah.  Any suggestions for future meetings?  Oh, and I thought of pound cake too.  Any others?      kk thankith you <3
