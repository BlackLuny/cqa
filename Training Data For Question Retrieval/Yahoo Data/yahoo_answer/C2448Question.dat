20090223155233AAq4mTP	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is there an upside to allowing naiveté to run its course?	Instead of correcting it at every single deviation or minor detour, is there anything positive that can come of just letting it go where it goes?      If you don't want to read my woe-is-my-poor-suburbanite-existence twaddle, you could just answer the previous question and spare yourself a warm lap of semi-digested lunch. Thanks.       ______________________________________...   I'm a brat. I'm impossibly lazy. I have no motivation to do anything (as I've described [complained] about in previous posts.) I haven't any outstanding familial complaints, and I'd feel like a fraud if I tried to find some. I hail from a white, middle-class, Irish-American neighborhood where most (if not ALL) have a dog, a swimming pool, and two married parents. We live comfortably, to make the long story short, and I have the AUDACITY to want to drop out of college because I don't think I'm "cut out for it."  I'm wasting my father's hard-earned money.          I want to throw myself into some unknown territory. I have no money of my OWN to speak of (really,) so I'd be homeless. Could anything GOOD come out of this situation? I want to find something, (even if it is a hungry belly, and a sobering reality-check!)       This is naive, but I don't see any other way to go about this.       I think part of my problem is that I have an "all-or-nothing" personality and it bleeds into everything I do. Perhaps that's just an excuse. I'm good at excuses.

20090223155446AA2R5Gk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	If you can write great stories check this out...?	I need someone who can write a good story line for my show called Break. It's kind of a "School Life, Magical" type anime (even though I'm American).   The show involves a series of high school and middle school aged children who live on a fantasy island called Carra Island. The children come from all over the world, not just Japan and China.   On this island they learn how to harness and control their family’s magical skills. The main characters include: (the names can be changed later on but this is what I came up with)   MALES: Nazi Rackus   Asole Sonny   Fang Okamizuka   Zachy Heart   Phil Monarch   Leon Genius   Shinon Thomas   Shadow Kast   Tony and Anthony Pufiri      FEMALES:   Ashley and Amanda Sonny   Rin Montague   October Moon   Meghan McElroy   Lin Ming Umino   Stacy Harlot   Carrie Petal   Maria Pufiri      Other than what I just told you, there isn't a real story line. So could you guys please help me?!?!?   Just let me know if you're interested and I'll includes your stories in my show (along with all recognition needed).      PS   Please don't give me random comments that have nothing to do with my quest. This is very serious to me and I really don't want you playing with my feelings.

I Loath You", which as you know is the latest one in her Clique series. I was wondering why on the back of the book it says Alicia is ordered to the bottom of the cheer-pyramid when that never existed. Massie says she's over pryamids even though Alicia's the one that told her they were out, but she never got sent to the bottom of the non-existing pyramid. Was this a mistake Lisi made? Or am I missing something in the book?
20090223160001AAGRS7p	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Suggestions for a Sherlock Holmes fan.?	Since I was fourteen, I've been a huge Sherlock Holmes fan and I can safely say that I've read all of Doyle's SH adventures at least three times over.       Last Christmas I received "The Gaslight Grimoires" which is basically a compilation of various Sherlock Holmes spin-offs written by various Doyle fans/respectable authors. I thought it was a great read (except for the second story; His Last Arrow, I think it's called) and I managed to finish the book in about two days.      Even though Doyle was the original mastermind behind the series, I'd really like to find some more books like the Gaslight Grimoires. Does anyone know anymore decent SH spin-offs? Maybe I could mix it up and read Rex Stout, or Agatha Christie? Any reviews on their work?      All ideas are welcome!

20090223164656AAY1lBb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Read this story and tell me what you think :D I just made it up on the spot?	okay, here's the deal, bellow is a short story that I made up right when I decided to ask a question... I made it up in like 4 minutes so don't be TOO mean :D lol      I walked slowly to the bus stop today. It wasn't everyday you experience the loss of a pet and forget about it over night. But the only difference is... I haven't forgotten.   It's been 16 hours since the loss of my lovely dog, Dingo. He was the best. Come to find out, he really was part Dingo. The other half was german shepherd. I loved that little stinker dog. He was my best friend.   The bus pulled up, it seemed to eek it's way to the intersection. Its doors opened sluggishly and I stepped in.   "Good morning Anne." The driver said, like always.   "Mmm.." I groaned, I usually said hi and sat behind her to talk. Kelley was the best bus driver ever. So nice. But today I sat in the back, alone.   School crawled by... Minute by lasting minute, the 7 periods of junior high passed my mind and flowed back to their origianl state. This was going to be a horrible week...      So how is it so far? You like it? :D   Sorry about any typos or mis-spellings. Lemme know if you want more and I'll add more :D
20090223163031AA2icNr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of the beggining of my story? I really appreicate all the comments!!!?	Chapter 1:   I slowly rolled my eyes open. I found myself very hot and my eyes staring at a bright crimson shade of the sun and a vast field shining through the window. The windows were open, but it was burning in here! Here we were driving to the New York community swimming pool. A hot summer day where everyone here is New York is swimming. But why did I fell asleep? What was taking so long? Why are we not there yet? Oh. I suddenly remembered where I was. Anger rose to my chest again, my teeth clutched together, and my fists closing together. I just wanted to scream! I pulled my shoulder length chestnut-blond colored hair behind my shoulders and gave them a little pull. Sitting in the car going to our new house did not make me happy. Where the heck is Hopewell, Virginia anyway? How can this city were moving to be full of hope!? There is no hope without Kaitlyn. Why did we have to leave Kaitlyn? Kaitlyn Elizabeth Thomson I’ve known forever. We grew up as babies… as toddlers… to kindergarten... and elementary school. Now going to our 8th grade year without each other. Gosh, Kaitlyn is probably even madder for me moving then I am. I laughed at that thought. It seemed to be very true. Kaitlyn came to my house more then any person I know, but she did live next door. She loves dancing, as much as I love to draw. I wonder how my other friends are… Kaitlyn would have never been popular if it were not for me. I loved to talk, but Kaitlyn didn’t. Kaitlyn in New York and I stranded here in Virginia was not where I though we would be a year ago. My mother caught my eye.   “Hi, Adrianne. You feel asleep,” my pregnant mother told me, rubbing her tummy where my future sister, Bethany Allison Locke, is.   My grumpy response was turning away and staring out the window. Out of the country, we turned into an actually city. Houses were near. I saw kids riding their Barbie and Spiderman bikes, houses that were perfect like my New York apartment. I sighed and thought of my old apartment. My perfect apartment with my friends and school and family… Just because of my future baby sister, we had to move.   “A better life for her and us,” my mother described to my brothers and I when we found out we were moving.   My twin brothers, Michael and Carter, suddenly started screaming excitedly when we reached the sign: Hopewell, Virginia. My parents smiled. Marley, my beautiful golden retriever even barked with her head sticking out the window. We turned into a neighborhood that was surprisingly pretty. I could see teenager boys mowing their family’s yard. I also saw two little kids holding a lemonade stand. There were some kids outside, while others stayed inside from the hot heat. At every house, there was a rose garden with all extraordinary colors. I slouched down my seat and waited. I hadn’t seen the house before, since there was a long drive from New York to Virginia. My mom and dad only saw the house once, a long drive of course, but fell in love with the house. Neither did I want to see the house trying to not imagine what it would be like to leave Kaitlyn, my school, and my lovely apartment. Now I knew what it would be like. My dad, the driver at this very moment, turned our Red Honda into a driveway. I examined the peach colored house that was right in front of our car. The porch was colored a dark sea green, which stood on the left side of the house. The two car garage was also dark green, standing right in front of the driveway. I peeked over the top of the house, realizing my house was one storied. I suddenly disliked one story houses. Two storied houses were much better, I decided. I looked at our front yard that was placed in front of the porch. The grass was very green like it was watered every day. Not surprised, there was also a strip of the lawn filled with roses. Unbelievably, I suddenly liked my new neighborhood. I liked my new house. But a saddened thought came to my head. Kaitlyn would like this house, too. No, she would have loved it. But she’s not here anymore as tears swelled up in my eyes. Be strong, be strong, I thought. I had to stop thinking about Kaitlyn, I urged myself. But I have never been away from Kaitlyn. We lived right next to each other in apartments for the first twelve years of our lives. Now, thirteen years old we were, without each other. The thought of us living without each other in our new, important, special, teen lives made me almost cry. Almost. But I didn’t.

20090426181912AAM85VC	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How is this poem i wrote, "Imperfect Pictures?  Honestly.  10 free points!?	A distorted drawing,   I tell myself,   As real,   As true.      An imperfect world I seem to draw,   With a pen,   Drawing uncertainties,   Of the skies of blue.      I smile in dwelling,   The pictures I seem to draw,   Not beautiful paintings,   But feelings which are raw.      Flipping pages slowly,   Observing to be found,   The world is looking sunny,   When I touch the ground.      In my mind I paint these pictures,   Never as beautiful as see,   So I decide to not paint,   And leave it as a dream.      That imperfect world I seem to draw,   I leave it as a dream,   A dream: genuine and true,   A dream: the now of reality.
20090223163735AAf7WQ7	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	Fantasy Art Help: Need a pic of a village/town?	Hi, I'm drawing a picture for my HS art class.  So far, I've drawn the dragon and left a lot of space to the right, where the dragon's looking.  I hoped to place some sort of fantasy-art village there, but I'm struggling to find a good pic I can (using the grid-style) draw onto my drawing.      So far, most of the ones I've found were either way too good for me to draw (artistic noob here), not at a very good angle as if the dragon is looking down-ish towards it, or the picture will be of just a single house rather than a town.      Any good picture or art advice on this issue would be great.  I'm considering just cutting off that half of the piece of paper, but I don't think my teacher will grade that too nicely.      Thanks!

Eye to eye we met, my smile was a chance.   A chance that made you head over heels, for a simple girl like me.   Who knew that little smile, would forever make us be.   Married in Southern China, we then stayed in Timbuktu.   You spoke of our endless love, turned out it wasn’t true.   We lived in a house in London, but then you had to go.   You walked away by choice, something I didn’t know.   I decided to move to Poland, it kept me somewhat busy.   Remembering that you were born here, made me rather dizzy.   On the shores of Maine, I took a long vacation.   Saw your eyes in the blue sea, a very obvious relation.   Flew to the bitter Alps, then I could be alone.   Too bad I remembered your strength, in every rock and stone.   Saw the sun in Hawaii, you were always bright.   Walked the dark streets of Romania, where you could have held me tight.   Years were passing by, time went in every place.   Each and every inch of the world, reminding me of your face.   I fell asleep and never woke, on a small beach in Spain.   Trying to forget those memories, that forever caused me pain.   Wherever I may go, whether old or new,   A home is not a home, unless it comes with you.

Or maybe just a happy death.      ex.   One Night i went to bed, knowing sum how this would be the last time i slept in this bed. I closed my eyes and pictured the room just the way it was meant to be. I smiled and went over to the door, i heard a gentle knock as the wind brushed the trees. I opened the door to find an older gentlemen wearing a black cape. A good friend that i had recognized from all of my dreams, that sadly only came when there was a tragedy. Smiling, i opened the door and led him inside. His face had a worried look. Still smiling i got him a cup of tee and brought it to him. I asked him how he had been, if he needed anything else. We chatted for a while, and then he stood up and said, this visit was nice but i am here for business not pleasure. Standing up and brushing my self off, i said yes i no ive said my good byes i am ready to go. Looking flabbergasted at the fact that i wouldn't run he extended his bony arm and said well then it is time, take my hand. Grace fully i grabbed his arm and he put up his hood. Revealing for the first time who he was. As we walked out the door with the accumulating fog, i asked reaper how come you never visit me for a happy occasion. Then we dissolved into the moon light.

20081109162546AAKos2l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Isn't Harry Potter more of a love story than Twilight?	Now I know Twilight is a romance while HP just has more romantic subplots. But reading twilight, i did not get the impression that Edward and Bella were in love at all. Bella is selfish and loves Edward because he looks like a god. And Edward loves Bella because of her scent. I dont feel for them at all and it seems more lust than true love. Plus it happens way to fast. In HP, we have Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny as the two main romances. These relationships seem way more realistic and build up better. Just because they're not obsessive and in your face and not all "I love you, you're my world, blah blah blah" means its not a love story? And while these romances start out small and get bigger, they get married and live happily. Bella on the other hand, chooses to ditch her family and friends, and education to be with a creep

I didn't even notice that I was turning the pages I was so involved in the story.       I felt that way about the beginning of Breaking Dawn too, but after Bella becomes a Vampire the story goes horribly downhill. reading through the book for the second time, I find myself struggling to finish it. It's taken me a month to read 50 pages. I just can't get into it when I know how pointless the whole battle thing was. Does anyone else feel this way?      I still love the series as a whole, but I just don't like Bella as a vampire. She's too perfect.

The Lion that roars his mighty call,   As he awaits to fight them all,   One by one they come so fast,   But none of them shall even last.   For in that ferocious bundle of fur,   Lies the one thing that beats rage :   Courage.      Lying in a white, blank room,   Faces crowding in,   Water sprouts from the root of sight,   And rolls silently down their cheeks,   As the beeping increases,    And your sight is blurred,   Courage ; is what gives you air.      The frolicking flames danced their dance,   To the music of tortureous sobs,   As the walls bow down their heads,   To the one whose power robs,   But there is one,   Who can save them all,   And ruin the rulers fun,   Courage is all it takes,   To make one another safe.      And yet, when I look into your crystal eyes,   My heart beating faster than time can tell,   I am frozen.   I cannot speak,   I cannot move,   I can only look, and wish.   For the wall of courage that I had built,   Has tumbled from your stare,   And the words that I had wished to speak,   Are simply just not there.   For deep inside my needing arms,   I ; have a fear.      Hope you like! Tell me what you think thanks.
