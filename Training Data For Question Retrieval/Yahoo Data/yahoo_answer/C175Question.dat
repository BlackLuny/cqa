I had cramping and spotting on 4/18 and went to the ER, they couldn't find anything on ultrasound and my hcg was 585. Monday 4/20 I went to my OBGYN and he did more blood work and it was 930 but still nothing on ultrasound. Thursday 4/23 still nothing on the ultrasound and hcg 1500. Monday 4/27 hcg was 4500 and still nothing on ultrasound. The OBGYN says he will let me go tomorrow for more blood work and another ultrasound, but if still nothing he wants to do a laparoscopy to look for a tubal pregnancy. According to charts I should be about 7 weeks, but I swear I had a period April 7th.       Anyone ever gone through this?

20090203133323AAdC8b1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	What do you think of this?	In class we were discussing a story in which a child's parents are divorced and her father abandoned her at birth.  Her mother remarries and then her step father adopts her.  Her father wants nothing to do with her and her mom is abusive.      Then someone started laughing since they were like "Adoption is for losers, nobody's parents are divorced, they are losers."  They kept portraying both negatively.  I am an adoptee whose adoptive parents have separated and can relate to this story very much.  I had this urge to cry the entire time this was going on.  And I even asked to go to the bathroom and I shed a couple tears.  What they were saying was so wrong that it would be a violation of Community Guidelines to post it on here.  And the teacher was agreeing too!  Why is the world so ignorant!?!

20090203122628AAzBCt5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Wow.....What would you do if this was you.?	Okay my good friend says she knows a woman (by the way my good friend is kind of a gossip)      Well this woman is going through a divorce.  And she just found out she is pregnant.  (The father is the ex)      Well the woman doesn't want to tell him and her motives for not wanting to tell him are to strictly hurt him.      (They just grew apart she says and she doesn't want anything to do with him anymore, he wasn't abusive or anything)      She doesn't want the baby but she knows he will and she will then be forced to keep the baby.      She doesn't want an abortion but she wants to have the baby and give the baby up for adoption and be totally done with this whole situation.      She knows she won't be able to put the baby up for adoption without the fathers consent so she said she would just tell them she didn't know who the father was.         I feel that is very irrational.....I mean what if the father wants the child she could give up her rights or they could decide together to give up the baby.         I find this a very disturbing situation on all ends......If you were in that situation what would you do?      I would have to tell the father I mean that is his child too.  (But I don't ever plan on being in that kind of situation, my husband and I take our vows very seriously)

For the past 2  weeks i have been experiencing headaches, constant nagging headaches which are very unusual for me and started about when i would have implanted (according to my charts). I have also noticed my veins much more visible all over my body, especially my breasts but even in my eyes, they look all bloodshot.    So my question is, did anyone else experience headaches and visible veins like this right before or when you found out you were pregnant?       And i am testing tomorrow, so i'll keep you all posted!

Milk came right away and I breast fed him for a whole year without any supplements. I just gave birth to my second child 2 days ago thinking all would be a breeze. Although, I have nothing, but little drops of colostrum. (I know b/c I pumped and barely anything came out.) They say it has lots of nutrition, but I'm afraid it just won't due with satisfying my son's hunger and health.  He cries and just won't even bother with trying to breast feed anymore. I'm frustrated and sad. I'm resorting to formula now. They say breast milk can sometimes take 3 days to come in, but what if it doesn't come in at all? What can I do to stimulate my milk to come faster?  I don't want him to get sick of "trying" to breast feed or having him get use to formula. Any suggestions?

The first day of my last period was on the 27th Jan.   on the 20th Feb I took one of those "First Response" pregnancy test which are supposed to detect pregnancy hormones 6 days before your next period is due (my next period was due on the 24th Feb.) and it came back negative.       On the 24th Feb when my period was due (I'm on a regular 28 day cycle) it didn't come so I took a "Clear Blue" test and it came back positive!!   I am really confused as to whether or not I'm pregnant. I'm still getting period like cramps, my breast are tender and feel a little sick.   I'm waiting until the 28th Feb to take another test to confirm.      My friend tells me that sometimes you can be so desperate to become pregnant that your body releases hormones that could give you a positive result...      I would love to know what everybody else thinks....I need to prepare myself for Saturday if it comes back negative.      Thanks

20070315133447AAtRIjY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think that sometimes....?	Parents are so oblivious to their own children, that sometimes they don't even realize that what their kid(s) are getting themselves into can mean a life long addiction: to drugs, not getting attention so they do bad.            Tell me if you think this is wrong or not, I certainly think so...
20070220202837AA9gjMB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Just looking for advice?  TTC 1 year 4 months?	I've been TTC for awhile now.  I had a progesterone test at day 21 and it said I hadn't ovulated that month and they are gonna put me on Clomid, they canceled my appt. last Thursday because he was in surgery and I have an appt. this Thursday.  Day 21 was a Tuesday the 6th, well the next Sunday my cm was a little more springy and very abundant.  Well we did things that night and I thought that there's a rare chance I ovulated.  Well I was supposed to start Monday (based on the fact that I normally have a 34 day cycle)  I took a test this morning it was neg.  I didn't have any regular ovulation tests so I couldn't confirm ovulation that weekend.  I don't think I am pregnant, I've just run out of hope.  Each month comes and nothing.  The doctors think I have PCOS but they haven't said to me directly "you have polycystic ovarian syndrome" but they said they thought that's what it was.  I'm going to ask Thursday but I fit all the symptoms and so do my blood tests.  Anyone have advice?

I am currently 24 weeks pregnant with twin girls and looking for opinions on the names we have narrowed it down to.  My husband and I have decided that Baby A will be Juliana Catherine.  We are still undecided with Baby B.  We both like the names Jillian Caroline and Jasmine Caroline but not really sure which one to go with or also open to think of other names.  We have a 19-month old son, John Michael and would like a name that would flow with his name as well.  We are sticking with the 'J' names and do not like Jessica, Jamie or January due to past relationships.  Also, I do not like Josephine or Jacqueline.  Thanks in advance for your input.

20090224190841AAiKeP6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	You you be upset if someone compares your baby to a dog?	My baby will be a year next month. My husband and I decided to take the day off to spend it with her since we are rarely both with her at the same time. We work opposite shifts so majority of the time we are basically like a single mother/father. Well, my boss denied my day off but changed his mind later on. He asked the lead in my dept to post a sign up for overtime for that day. I totally appreciated it. The lead was very upset and complained about it yesterday (my day off) to all my co-workers saying it's stupid and unheard of for someone to want to take their kid's b-day off. She said if I can do that then she will take her dogs b-day off. It's the same thing. Now seriously I love dogs but comparing a dog's b-day to my baby's 1st birthday is ridiculous. My co-worker told me all about it when I returned to work today. Should I say something to her. I'm seriously upset about it. Do I have a reason to be upset?

And have very irregular periods...I had a dr's appointment 2 weeks ago. She said I wasn't pregnant but took blood to see what was going on. I go again tomorrow for my blood results. Also, she is giving me something so I start my period. Well, yesterday when I woke up and went to the bathroom, there was a slight pinkish tint to the TP, so I was excited and thought I was starting, but no period. Evertime I went to the bathroom, no more pink. Then this morning, same thing, pinkish tint, then nothing else. It only happens in the morning... What's going on?

We got an ironing board, propped it against the stairs, I laid on it with my head down (on my back, of course =P), we put a cold pack against the baby's head, and my hubby talked to my (pardon the word) crotch (O.o) thru a paper towel tube lmao!      All we managed to do was make me laugh and the baby switched from head on the upper right, to head to the left.  I go in to the hospital to have the doctor try to move her on Tuesday morning.

I'd heard rumours before from my mom that my dad used to sexually abuse and/or rape little/young black girls. We ourselves are white though and this all apparently happened when I was still young myself. But yesterday I was visiting with my step-sister and she told me that in the past 8yrs there have been two cases that she knows about where my dad abused girls again. The one was a 6yr old girl on whom he performed oral sex while masturbating. My stepmom got suspicious and found out about it. In the end my dad supposedly paid off the girl's parents to keep quiet. The other girl was 15yrs old and he got caught for it too. I dont know any details but apparently he appeared in court for it. Looks like he got away with it somehow cos he's still around instead of in jail.

20090203134631AAsYEte	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Daughter and sleep?!?	My daughter is now a little over a year.  Just recently we've gotten her to sleep in her own crib.  She goes down to bed around 8 every night, usually without a problem and is asleep shortly after we lay her down.  Sometimes she'll cry maybe 10 minutes or so and we'll have to go in and lay her down and stand there till she is asleep (if she opens her eyes and notices we are not there, she freaks out and cries again)  And if i just let her cry herself to sleep, she falls asleep standing up which causes to loose her balance eventually and wake up and cry again.  What do you think I should do?  Just put her to bed and not go back in?  Continue laying her down like we've been doing?  She still nurses before bed, so I nurse her but sometimes she wants to play so i'll put her in her crib and tell her it's bed time.   Also, when she wakes up anytime between midnight and 2am, should I nurse her in my bed with me (this seems to be the only way to get her back to sleep)?  Give her a bottle and leave her in her room?  Do nothing and let her cry herself back to sleep?  Does anyone have any experience with this and have any suggestions?  I just want her to sleep through the night :)  I'm ready to get my sleep back :)
20090203135343AAQ7ZDE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 7 month old is not sleeping well anymore, Should I "sleep train" ? and how does one sleep train?	I was one of those lucky moms. At one month old my baby was bathed and ate her last meal while I sang her a lullabye. She took 10-15 mins. to fall asleep and was out for the night (in her crib) until 5:30 a.m. afterwhich I just picked her up and let her feed and sleep in my bed.  Now she's 7 months old and I can't sleep a wink! She had a cold and wasn't sleeping very well. Actually I had to wake up every 1-2 hours and pat her back to sleep or attempt to breastfeed her.  Now it's gotten worse.  She will sleep only 2 hours at a time and when she wakes up NOTHING sooths her except my breast and she doesn't even eat she suckles for like 6 seconds and goes back to sleep. I'm back at work and have been so tired that I just let her sleep with us.  Now I think she's over her cold but she's still waking up ever 1-2 hours and my breasts hurt! I dunno what to do. I dont want to let her cry it out. I'd like to know if you know any sleep training methods I can try out. I dont mind if she cries a little bit just not for hours at a time.     Any suggestions?

Will the baby recognise its daddy's voice? as he wont have been home all that long before it is born, my husband is scared the baby is gonna think he is a stranger.    Admittedly saying that my husband can talk for england and if the baby does recognise him it will prob think "does my daddy ever shut up"    This may sound a silly q but i just wasn't sure if the baby will know who he is whilst its in my tummy as he has not been there all that long.    He will be back when i am 25 weeks.
20090203140930AAb0Rtc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think of the following story?	What do you think of the following true story?  A 16 year old American has been living in Holland since 1994, and was granted asylum/refugee status in 1997 along with his mother and two older siblings.      The two older siblings were abused by the father and the only way American mother could protect them was to flee to the Netherlands.      He wants to meet his father for the last two years.  His father never wanted to have any thing to do with him.  (His father never abused him) He has Minnesota judge taking legal action against his mother for not giving him full custody as required by Minnesota law in 1994, just to get over $50,000 child support back.   This is why he cant visit the US until he is 18 years old.
20090203141148AADAdIE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ladies, can you tell you're pregnant before a test can tell?	Kind of an odd question but I was just wondering if there are any signs of feelings or whatever that let women know they are pregnant before they can actually get positive test results. I'm under the impression that you have to wait so many days after you miss your period before you take a pregnancy test, but do we know our bodies well enough to know something is going on? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

20090203135146AAAYKxu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Put yourself in my position. What should I do?	This is a repost. I just want more opinions because it is a big decision.. This long story is being condensed now so if you have any questions because I have left anything out - I will add in the additional details.      I had been going out with a childhood friend for 2 years (I am 18 in 2 days) and I didn't get on with my family but my mother and his mother agreed that I could move in with his family mainly because it was more convenient with school and stuff. He means everything to me and has helped me through so much in my life and I am so grateful to have someone I can trust like that.      Around a month ago, I moved back in with my mother and sister (15) because my sister got pregnant... I am kind of the mediator in the family and I feel as thought that is all I will ever be good for.      I broke up with James because I didn't want him to be dragged in to the whole mess.. And I seriously regreted it... If you read my other question that explains all of it.      I missed him - He missed me and we decided to go and talk yesterday. It felt good to know that he forgave me - even though I fail to see why - he could have any girl he wants and he likes me...      BUT now.. he is moving to the other side of the country.    I talked with his and my mum and they said that if I really wanted to - I could move with his family.       I don't know what to do.. Could I really leave my sister while she is pregnant? Her and my mother are always fighting... She looks up to me and without me - I don't know if she would be able to cope. (By no means am I trying to sound arrogant but I am trying to say that there is no real positive influences in her life and the area we live in now is horrible..)       If you were me would you move or stay? I don't know whether to put myself first or not - because I never have.

20090203140124AAXTQZz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Kangaroo Care...aka Skin to skin...?	Did you opt out of skin to skin contact with your baby immediately after birth?  Or did you decide to do skin to skin immediately after?  I want to do skin to skin immediately after, however I want my baby to be cleaned first.  I know one can tell the doctors to clean the baby off first but, is that kosher?  I feel like the nurses may look at me strange if I say "please clean him before he touches me."  I get very queezy at the sight of blood...therefore I'm scared I may have the same reaction when I see my baby covered in blood and muscu.

20090203140504AA8erUu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	When do you know you're ready, and what are the chances...?	Okay, I'm fourteen and asking a question about sex and pregnancy, and I know that most people think that fourteen is too young to be sexually active. But don't wail on me about that. It's not really what I'm asking.      I want to know when it IS acceptable to start having sex with your partner. My boyfriend recently asked me to marry him, and I said yes. I love him, regardless of all the people that say we're too young. I love him, and he said that he's going to stick around. I know that most guys say that, and a lot of teen mothers are still left single and abandoned. I'm willing to take the chances.      And if I do become sexually active, what are the chances that I will get pregnant? Is there a certain statistic?       I'm scared to get pregnant, but at the same time I know that I'd be able to take care of it. (with help *that I've already been promised* from my family)

I know how annoying these questions can be, so don't bother answering if you're going to be rude, or say "Buy a pregnancy test" or something.       ?¤·?      I first would like to state I'm 21 years old, and have been with partner for 6 years. We live together and work full time. We're not exactly trying, but not exactly stopping it from happening either. We'd be overjoy if it did, cause we have been talking about trying.       Well, this month I did indeed get my AF. It was a day early, and last longer then usual. (6 days, normally I'm 3-4) Anyways, the reason why I am sorta contemplating it, is because I've really noticed my appetite changing. Everything I once desired, really makes me nausea's now. I'm wanting foods I barely eat. When I'm hungry, the thought of food makes me feel sick.       Again, I doubt I'm pregnant, cause I did get it this month, but thinking about it, last month I was 6 days late, and I know some women still get their period. I know its a rare thing, but it could happen. I'm pretty sure my mother stopped getting hers, but a couple months (3) ago when I told her my periods have slowed down to 3 days from the usual 6, she automatically asked if I was pregnant, so now I don't know, maybe she did still get it.       1) How is it possible for women to get their periods while pregnant?      2) What could else could be leading my sudden appetite change, and nauseousness when I think or smell food?       3) Thoughts? Anything.

Ok so I read all over the internet not to use bumper pads because of suffocation but last night my baby's leg was in between a rail.  I think I should put it back on what do you think?  I don't want him to hurt his leg and can't get it out while I am asleep I would feel horrible.
20090225022920AAnEwdI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I have now found out what this practice is about with their swimwear?	After  a long but calm  talk with my 15 year-old daughter.  I have finally got what it is out my daughter what the practice is apparently it is quite common practice at the moment as well for girls to permit their boyfriends to do this, the brave apparently let the boy do it while they are wearing the bikini or swimsuit.        POPPING is when the girl either allows or assists the boy to masturbate on the bikini or swimsuit when it is brand new.      SPOTTING is the same practice just when the garment is an existing bikini or swimsuit.       I think it is a disgusting practice and cannot understand why they would even want to do it. I have also told my daughter this as well as the obvious other risks involved.

I'm 16 and my parents are separated and currently I spend 2 weeks at my dad's house and 2 weeks at my mum's house. However, I don't want to stay at my dad's house anymore and I want to live permanently with my mum, but she says NO.      My dad is 47 and his girlfriend is moving in with him soon and she is only 20! Apart from being a total b*tch for lack of a better word, I just find it too awkward to live with her. She can't act like a parent to me, because she is only 4 years older than me and she can't act like a friend either, because that would be way too weird, so we really don't know where we stand with each other. I hate her so much, but my dad  does not care at all and tells me that I need to grow up and just accept that she is very important in his life and that he loves her and if I don't like it, then I can go and live with my mum until I begin acting "reasonable" again, but my mum won't let me. She says it would be totally unfair on her, if my dad never had to have me stay at his and that he would just be able to live life like a man with no children and forget about his responsibilities. She does not care that I hate my dad's girlfriend and she just says well that's your dad's problem and you need to sort it out with him, because she can't tell him who to date.      PARENTS: Do you think my mum is being totally unfair and unreasonable? If you were her, would you let your daughter live with you, because she finds it too awkward to live with her father's girlfriend? She is totally big on the shared custody thing and things always being fair and equal and so it wouldn't be fair on her if I lived with her apparently, which is why she is saying no and I that I need to sort it out with my dad, because it is his girlfriend, not hers.

20090225023436AAwtsYi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Are you sick of people having way too many kids?	In my opinion 2 is the most you should have (replacements), but 1 or none is ideal. The Earth is overcrowded and we humans, similar to a virus, are slowly killing it. What's with selfish/ignorant people having 5+ kids?       FYI: There is this pill called birthcontrol that was created not too long ago; use it!!!
20090225020626AAx9YZw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What do you reckon? Am I preggers?	These are the symptoms i have:      *Bigger breasts   *Headaches   *sore feet   *when i walk for too long my hips and legs cant handle my upper weight   *gaining of weight   *loss of appetite   *eating lots   *clothes not fitting   *movement in my lower abdomen   *discharge   *no period for the last 3-4months   *bellie grown and sticks out even if i wear baggy clothing   *nausea and sickness   *tiredness   *cravings   *cramping   *sore lower back   *stretch marks   in your own honest opinions, do you think i could be pregnant. I only felt most of these symptoms about 2 months ago. Now it's just the sore back, sore feet, legs and hips when i walk, the bigger belly, loss of appetite, weight gain, stretch marks, severe headaches and being exhausted fast. Not only that, when i do eat, i get full real easy and it takes ages for my food to digest. Also i have movement in my lower abdomen that moves in the middle, and sides. its weird, its like someone is poking at me from the inside, but softly.      just need any of your lovely woman's advice on this one...      p.s: haven't taken a test yet. haven't been able to get into town for a very LONG time.   thanks! :)

The last few weeks they have been talking and flirting a lot in class and afterwards, and recently one of her friends spoke to him and said that he should ask her out, so today he decided to ask her out finally...      And when he did she thought he was just joking and kind of laughed it off. But he's really crushed now and doesn't know what to do.      Any suggestions to cheer him up?

20090225021729AAu8qmg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Fetal movement question?	I have felt my baby since about 18 weeks of pregnancy.  I am now 32 weeks and lately the movements have felt different.      A part of my stomach will get really hard all the sudden where she moves or is positioned at.  I have never felt this before.  Is this common since I'm getting bigger and further along?      And this is NOT braxton hick contractions, I have had these already and my whole stomach hardens.  With the movement, only certain parts of my belly harden.        Hopefully I made sense... I have a doctors appointment tomorrow morning, should I mention this for concern?

Hi I married my wife knowing she was pregnant with someone else's baby, I knew than and married her as i started to love her. Recently I revealed this to a female co-worker and she said that my wife was cheating on me as I am becoming bald. ( I am balding at the age of 26). I don't think that its cheating as she told me before hand that she was pregnant.
