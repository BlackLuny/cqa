Here's a picture of my wall (ignore all the Harry Potter, haha):  http://img250.imageshack.us/my.php?image...       So my problem? It's just... long. It's broken up a bit by the change from carpet to vinyl, but it's still long and awkward. Any decoration tips?       One of the big problems is that nothing really matches, because my landlady (who furnished this apartment) uses her sketchy pack-rat collections for decoration. So, because it's her furniture, I can't really take anything out, put it into storage and replace it with other things.        But along with that black futon, table, and bookcase at the right, I've got two other little white bookcases (about the height of my table) to use in this decoration process.      Ideally, I'd like to be able to work with what I've got, instead of going out and getting a couple more pieces of furniture. But if you have ideas for tapestries, floor lamps, bead curtains, whatever - I'm all ears!      Thanks in advance!

I am going to start remodeling my condo/townhouse and Lowes sells Whirlpool, not GE and Home Depot sells GE not Whirlpool.  So I cannot really have a salesman on hand to make comparison suggestions.  I am getting a fridge, dishwasher, stove or cooktop, overhead microwave, and front loading washer and dryer.  For resale purposes I want all the brands to match.  Also, I have checked out LG, pretty stuff, but the few people I know that purchased it are already having problems.  I am a mother of 2 kids so these appliances will be used alot and I do not have time for anything beside regular maintence.  The occasional breakdown I understand, but overall I want something that will at least last me 10 years that is reliable and has a good reputation.  Any repairmen out there feel free to give me your opinion also.  I like GE's innovations in thier cooktops & fridges, but I like WHirlpool's steam washer!

There are just many different bright polka dots like that so I don't want anything too busy but something other than a solid color wall. Please no polka dots or stripes on the wall either. I may do splatter paint but i may not. just need some ideas. Would it be too hard? how would i go about doing it? and just different ideas would be GREATLY appreciated. I'm thinking of using either aqua and lime green or aqua lime green and pink. Again, it all depends the paint design. Anyone who answers this all gets best answer!

I put the end opposite the vacuum handle into the output so that it fills with water.  Then, I take that same end and put it over the "thing" with the basket.  I begin to get going and nothing, no suction.  Also, the "thing" over the basket keeps coming off since I have no suction.  I have done this probably 25 or so times and want to cry.....

I have a Dyson washer, vacuum and a mini Dyson, I have had to call them out time after time after time, my washer is now broke, 3 kids off school 1 sick and the washer broke, called them up ￡93 call out, yes it includes parts etc but this will be the 5th call out in 2 years for the washer alone, the vacuum has had god knows how many, does anyone else think I would have been better off buying a cheaper brand? Are cheaper brands more reliable?   These are some answers already given when I asked earlier..do you agree>>?   "expensive mistake! we bought one and it doesnt work at all. they say in the commercial never looses suction. its bacause it doesnt have any to begin with!"   "Cheaper brands are more reliable and are easier to fix.   They last longer (if you look after them properly!) and are cheaper to replace.   The parts are easier to get hold of too."   "That's odd. I thought Dyson washers had a two year guarantee, and in any event you are covered by the 1979 Sale of Goods Act. The washer has to be durable, last a reasonable length of time and do what it is supposed to do. Yours has failed on all 3. Dyson owe you several call out charges i'm afraid.   Personally, i wouldn't buy one. James Dyson valued his British workforce so much he sacked the lot of them and moved to a factory in Malaysia"   I believe they are cheap designs I believe investing alot of money in Dyson was a huge financial mistake.   I work hard to support my family being a single mom and one wage coming in, I saved hard to buy "the best" and it has cost me dearly.  How do you feel about DYSON?

We've been to B&Q and got a very high price (we haven;t picked top of range for everything either) for a very small bathroom - they even charge extra ￡550 just to remove tiles!  Labour is nearly double the parts for whole bathroom suite, including shower, titles, accessories, heated towel rail..etc.  There was also a ￡450 extra sur-charge because we are in a London Borough!!!  Is it so high because they get their cut, so we are paying some of our hard earned cash on thin air?      Also heard some of the taps and stuff can be naff and never any spares around in future.      QUESTION if you was going to rip your bathroom out, where would you look to get quality equipment and look at fitting?      Still considering B&Q but worried if theres a problem, the builder blames the surveyor, the surveyor blames the designer and we get nowhere and also not happy at the price at all (we even got the suite in half price!!!)      Honest question, what you would do in same situation, preferably by those either in the trade or been through the same.      Thank You

Not too bad as I have other works to be carried out in my house and this way means not paying all the money in one go so I can do what else I need to do in the house.       2nd company-￡3,950 for B rated windows, internally glazed.      3rd company-￡3,700 for A rated windows, internally glazed.       Advice please! Thanks.

20090220030121AA4LuAr	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Problem with dripping upstairs overflow?	Hope someone could shed some light on this..  my mothers house is a fairly large two-storey one, with an upstairs bathroom.  Above and outside the bathroom window there is a overflow pipe,just beneath the flat roof that the bathroom has, and if no-one uses the water in the house for a day or so,then this keeps dripping.      We've ruled out the most obvious cause, that being a faulty ball-cock valve in the cold water tank in the loft. This has been changed 3 times now by different men coming to the house and it hasnt solved the problem.  The last man that came said the problem may be casused by one of the mixer taps in either the downstairs kitchen, the upstairs sink unit tap in the bathroom, or the bath tap next to it.      My mothers away on holiday at the moment, so the overflow is dripping all the time now as no-one is there to draw the water.  I've tried to find out if its due to any of these three tap units by simply turning them on hot (cold doesnt seem to affect it) and watching what this does to the drip rate on the overflow.      Indeed each of the mixer taps turned on separately to hot will eventually stop the dripping if left running a minute or so.  But this doesnt really tell me anything.  Which of the taps could be causing the problem?? Are they causing the problem?  The last man that looked at this did say mixer taps can sometimes cause this problem.  Is this true?   What can be done about this?

The bed is prepared but I am concerned that all my efforts may be spoiled by the birds eating the seeds and shoots especially as I am in an area populated with pheasants.
