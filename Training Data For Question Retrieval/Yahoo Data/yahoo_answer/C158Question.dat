They get bad grades and act bad in school but their parents or whatever still buy them ****. My friend Bob smokes weed and he still gets all the **** he wants. While at the same time I havnt asked for anything in like 2 months and  I ask her to take me to the mall and shes like noo and I said why and shes like "ive been working all day" which she hasnt. Im 15 by the way.     Why does my mom do this.

20090203131842AAESjqH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I will not be putting money away for my childrens college education...?	It makes me a terrible mom in the eyes of most everyone I know, but I don't believe that college is something parents should be responsible for.  There are grants and loans, scholarships and jobs if you don't get enough for college that way.  My mother paid for her education, I paid for mine, my brother paid for his and we all turned out fairly good.        I also won't be contributing to any weddings that may be in the future for my kids.  I will contribute manpower and help in any other way they may need, but a wedding is not something a person needs.  If they want it badly enough they will figure out how to pay for it within their means.      Are you putting money away for your children to use for college?  How about weddings, will you be following the traditional roles and help pay for a wedding for your child?

After that she never got a period but recently got a POSITIVE on a test   So they doctor took blood and according to her bloodwork, she should be 8 weeks pregnant   But that doesnt make sense because the dates dont add up.

20090203131638AAhc30d	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I really want to do this, but I'm not sure if I should (not sex related)?	Ok so I go to an all girls school. A few months ago I met a guy from our brother school (the all guys school my school is associated with). Well really long story short, I messed up and we aren't talking now. He is friends with my best friend, but we dont talk. I promised him that I would let it drop and that I would forget everything except the fact that we were introduced. Even though we dont talk anymore, I still think about him a lot and I still like him.    His school thought of this idea. They call it "heart ot heart." It is where paper hearts go on sale at school for $1 each. You buy a heart and write something on it to a person at the other school. My school agreed. So now our schools are having a heart to heart.     So now to my dilema. Well I wanted to send one to him just saying something like "I'm sorry" or something like that. However, I don't know if I should. I know I promised to leave him alone, but I just want to be friends.     What should I do? Ireally just need some advice. ShouldI send a heart to him? and if so, what should I put on it?    Thanks in advance!

He suggested Ashley which isn't bad but I don't like it enough to call it out 50 times a day. He's trying to make the initials AAA, which i'm hoping he's joking.   I named our first 2 kids Dravion and Kaliyah.He named our third child Ebony. Even though we are acquainted with like 3 or 4 Ebonys.      Now we are trying to find a name together for this one. I don't want anything too out of the ordinary but I'm out of ideas. I just know I don't want anything that ends with "A" or sounds like it ends with "A". I don't want anything  ghetto sounding or nicknames for a first name. Something someone won't have any problem pronouncing or spelling.       Any suggestions, I can't really take going through another name list or baby name book.

One of the boys in our class is Arab and Muslim too. (He goes by Moe, but it's really Mohammad.)

I was trying to teach a lesson. Anyway, he ended up wetting his pants, and I ended up getting suspended. They're considering firing me. How can I save my job from this crazy political correctness?

20090203131923AAr4XDN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this a weird thing to do?	Okay so heres the dealio.      My soon to be fiance wants to have kids when we get married, but I do not want children. We are very much in love but this is something neither of us will budge on. So I came up with a good plan to make it work, tell me what you think . IT's a little out there but it could work.      He can have children with a different women (like a single women who wants kids but would like for the kids to have a father).. i dont care if they have sex a few times or whatever, just until she gets pregnant. Then when she has the children he can have joint custody of them so they can come visit him at our home, but they wont really be my kids. I'll just be like their step mom or something, and wont be in charge of displining them or changing their diapers of anything.      That way he gets kids and I dont have to have them. Good idea?

My insurance will only pay for one more IVF for my lifetime, but more importantly I may not have a job because I have no idea when I can go back to work. They rather not have me come back for two weeks if I am just going to be out again for treatment. what do I do now?

I just had a miscarriage on the 2nd of this month I havenâ€™t been to my post D&C Dr appointment yet. But I always read that you had to wait 3 normal cycles after a miscarriage to get pregnant again. But I see ppl on here who are trying again without even one regular cycle. Is this ok or are they acting against Drs orders. Does it make you more likely to miscarry again if you get pregnant to soon? Or is this just a formality Iâ€™m just wondering about other ppls experience.

20081209073625AAtrnzB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	*Possible Medical Emergency*?	I just caught my two and a half year old son eating Tums.  He was in my room while I was getting dressed and I went into my bathroom for my brush and when I came out he had a bottle of Tums and was eating it saying "Good candy".  I took the bottle from him, made him spit out what he had in his mouth and gave him some water.  I have no idea how many he ate, but it couldn't have been too many, no more than three or four tablets.      Before I get criticized for asking online, YES I have already called both Poison Control and his pediatrician.  Both told me to watch for vomiting, upset stomach or constipation but both also told me this probably won't be a problem. But I can't help but worry.      Has this type of thing ever happened to anyone else before and if so was your child ok?  Should I still be so worried that I feel sick myself?

The father has had no contact with me since I was in the ER for a subchorionic bleed at 10 wks. This child was not planned, we were not in a relationship. He said he would be there for him or her, but has shown NO interest.      If I put his name on the BC, he has to pay child support correct?      What if he demands custody? Can the courts order daytime supervised visits (ok with me) or weekend/overnights, or deny visitation at all?      He also is working as a server and CAN report way less than he makes. How do they determine how much a month he owes, and how can they garnish wages if there is NO PAYCHECK. (We worked together and when I served I didn't always get one, even if i worked as a hostess too.)      If I was to marry and he had not been paying support, could the stepfather automatically adopt or would we have to try and track him down?      Help please? Please, no rude comments, I'm trying to do what I feel at this point is best for my baby.

Mine has to be when my 4yr old neice asked why her other "Uncle" (not really related, just best friends with her dad) didn't love her.

She thinks you can only love one person at a time and was distraught to think that he didn't love her anymore.      I calmly had to explain to a sobbing child that lots of people love more than one person, just like she loves her mommy and daddy and I love her and her sister.      So, what's yours? It doesn't have to be from your child. Just from any child.

"A baby is God's opinion that the world should go on"      Last week I dreamt twice with my baby! On Wednesday,I dreamt of a very tiny girl that I could hold on the palm of my right hand. On Thursday,I dreamt of a boy that I fed with kisses(in my dreams, the boy was the baby of my sister's best friend). I felt anguish because I thought he was not going to make it without food, but I was amazed that he was growing and looking very healthy because of my kisses! This dream showed me that the biggest thing my baby will have is going to be my love!      Today I'm very happy because I'm going to see my baby again! Last week I felt him/her moving a lot while I was trying to sleep. It's a wonderful feeling... I don't care if I'm interrupted in my sleep. For me, everytime he/she moves it is like a knock from God in my womb to remind me that I'm blessed! That's why people say: Mom is mom!

Ok so I have been on the pill for awhile now, and my boyfriend and I had unprotected sex yesterday.

Anyway I know antibiotics make the pill not work (or severely reduce the effectiveness) and I've read that semen can live up to like 5 or so days in the body.  If I take the antibiotic and it reduces the pill, could I get pregnant from the semen already in my body?  
20081001112602AABeGjh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you do when you feel like the worse parent in the world?	My son is 2 1/2 and it seems like as he inches closer to three the independence grows far beyond my comprehension.  Well, lately I have been taking time out of the day to walk him to the park which is no hop, skip, and jump away from here.  I know he needs to express his independence but today we were walking through the soccer field, all of a sudden he turns around and starts running the opposite direction and as he gets further away I begin to holler for him to come back he doesn't listen then I start yelling his name and telling him to stop he keeps running as fast as he can go.  Finally after two to three minutes I catch up to him running as fast as I can and he just starts laughing.  I pick him up and tell him he's going in his stroller and we are going home he begins to smack my hand as I am carrying him back to the stroller.  So I hold his hands and say no hitting.  As I am buckling him into his stroller he keeps smacking my hand and I say no hitting and hold his hands while I am strapping him in.  Finally I wheel him home mad as hell and when I get to the door I get to his level and looked at him sternly and very firmly if not angrily told him you don't ever run away from your mother, I am very angry and what you did today.  At first  he starts laughing and then he gets kind of a concern look on his face because he can see that I am angry.  So I take him and put him in his bed and told him to lay down he kept getting up and laughing.  I finally took my hand swatted him on the behind (not hard at all just a tap) and told him to lay down that he was being punished.  Afterwards I felt so bad for swatting him because I do not like raising my hand to my son and feel that now I have ruined him for life.  I am trying the no hitting rule where no one hits and then I struck him on the butt (like I said gently) did I handle this too bad? Should I of swatted him at the park when I caught up to him?  I'm so upset right now I never want to take him to the park again.  I just want to chain him to his room until he's a teenager.

They are:   Girls:   Juliess Louisia (pronounced jew-lee-ESS   lew-EEZ-ee-ah)   Elliesse Giovanna (pronounced ELL-lee-ess  jee-oh-VAH-nah)   Christiane Bellarae (pronounced kris-tee-AHN   BELL-uh-ray)   Shelliana Lorielle (pronounced shell-ee-AH-nah  LOR-ee-ell)   Chartreuse Ivanka (pronounced shar-TREWS  eev-AHN-ka)      Boys:   Dillonus Carter (pronounced DILL-uh-nus  KAR-ter)   Mathison Oscarre (pronounced MATH-is-uhn  os-KAR)   Doriano Philipas (pronounced dor-ee-AHN-oh  FILL-up-uhs)      As you can see, we like original names.

20081014102056AAgNKyP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When should I test (possible tmi kinda long) :o)?	Ok. My last period was the 26th. I was fertile the 3, 4, and 5th. I ovulated on the 6th. I was sexually active with my husband from the 3rd on. I have 25 days in my cycle. I am not expecting my period until the 21st. I had 4 dots of blood in my underwear on Sunday night (the 12th) and only when I wiped. The next morning it was gone. I don't really have sore breast. They just kind of tingle. I have headaches and back aches and today I felt kind of dizzy. I took a test today (8dpo) and it was negative. After I ate breakfast well I didn't even finish I threw up. What could make me feel like this? Thanks in advance.

20081020023840AAbnomn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I have some concerns since my son started primary school, he was only 4 late in July..?	so he is one of the youngest in his class. He has been to a playgroup for a few hours a day 4 days a week for the last year and has never had a problem mixing etc. He started school and after a week I asked how he was doing and the teacher said that he wasn't mixing that well and was unsure about doing PE and was repeating that he didn't want to do it, the first 2 days he didn't eat his lunch. He is now mixing better, she comments that he doesn't really initiate the play but I can see myself outside the classroom in the morning that he chats and plays and chases like all the other children so I don't see this as an issue. At parent's evening she was discussing his fine motor skills, saying he struggles to cut with scissors and grip his pen. My son is left handed and so admittedly it doesn't come easy to him and we have never really encouraged him to use scissors at home. He much prefers activities such as sand and water play, playing with cars etc than crafting, to us he is a typical boy! She mentioned the repetition but could only really give us the one example. We are aware he repeats himself occasionally, but to us not worringly. She also claimed he didn't initiate conversation with her, but then went on to tell us about some questions he asked her! He starts and holds conversations with us and others on a regular basis and at home we have been practising his grip and he is cutting with scissors as well, he knows all the letters of the alphabet and recognises numbers and can count to over 20 so he has no difficulty in learning. I did complain to the teacher and the head teacher that I thought after 2 weeks it was far too early to be making judgements on a child's ability. It seems to be that so much is expected of them at such a young age and we were given the impression before he started that it was all learning through play, yet this doesn't seem to be the case. We think she is trying to say that he has some kind of autism related problem such as Aspergers and we are not sure he has.   Surely if he can draw and write and cut at home with us, mixes well with other children and converses as normally as most 4 year olds this isn't the case?

No smart comments because I am a grown woman and can hold my own, I just want some opinions.      Me and my guy were trying to get pregnant, well guess what now we are. My thing is before I found out I was kind of getting tired of him. And now that I am pregnant I decided that I dont want to move with him and I dont want to be with him. Now as far as baby, I know he will be the perfect father no matter what. All he wants is to have a family. Am I being selfish by wanting to be alone right now? Or is this just a phase? I don't even want to be around him right now? I still love him but I just don't want to be with him anymore. My mom said she felt the same way at first so just wait it out before doing anythign drastic. Is it bad to want my own house and not want to move with him?? Help ease my mind..

I have taken three pregnancy tests and they all come out negative. I have no signs of my period coming yet either. When I pee I have milky white discharge. It's not like discharge like a yeast infection that's clumpy or anything. Also, now my area is becoming very itchy and I read into if a yeast infection can make you miss a period but it said that you can't. I'm not sure what's going on. I would go to my doctor but I don't have insurance and I don't have the money right now to get a blood test done.    What do you guys think ??
20081119081219AA8aWAd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What could have happened with this cycle?	I normally have a menstrual cycle that lasts 30 to 32 days. I should mention that I am not on birth control and have not been for at least 7 months. Last month, AF came a day late, wasn't as heavy as normal and only lasted about 2 1/2 days. It usually lasts 4 or more. I have been tracking my cycles and normally would have ovulation symptoms and EWCM on or around day 18-20 of my cycle. I had a baby back on Dec 1st of 2007 and breastfed him until he was 7 months. I have had normal regular periods since 3 months postpartum. When I was trying to conceive him, I used an ovulation predictor kit and found out that I ovulated on day 19 of my cycle that month and was able to conceive that month. Ths month, I experience EWCM for about a day back on day 19 of my cycle, but it only lasted that day and for a fe hours the next morning. My husband and I did have intercourse on day 19 without protection. Now, since day 23 of my cycle I have had more mucus like discharge, but it is a little yellowish. We also had intercourse other times when I was 'supposed' to be fertile. Could this just be an odd cycle or could I have conceived? I should know since I have 3 children already, but I am older now and my body has changed.

20081119085050AAIm7rV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How much notice should i give quitting a babysitting job?	I sit for a adorable 3 mnth old but also have a 1 yr. old at home. At first it wasnt to bad but as the days went on my 1 yr. old is always crying at my feet anytime im taking care of the 3 mnth old wich is understandable but heartbreaking for me.Also the hours are  very long starting at 530 in the morning lasting sometimes till 800 at night with no notice. But its agravating that they do not call to let me know when they will be late when im expecting them no later then 600 pm and they dont show until 800 pm and do not call when they are going to be late in the mornings, so im getting up at 500 am waiting for them and sometimes they dont show up untill 630.

It had sayed I was on a different day then I was suppose to be.      I asked my mom what I should do, and she told me next time I bought a pack of pills, to take 2 a day. So I took 2 a day for about 4 days ( 8 pills in 4 days ) until I got on the right date.      Well, about a week or so later I woke up with bad stomach pains and started my period the next day. I wasnt suppose to start for atless 3 more weeks.      I figured I started it early because I had took all of those pills at the beginging of the month. The weird thing is, my period lasted for 2 weeks. It started out dark and got light and went away yesterday.      Here is my problem. Im starting to think im pregnant. I have a very small frame and im skinny, but my stomach is just getting big and ive been so moody and emotional about everything and eating constantly.       Was I bleeding because i took so many pills?   Could it mess me up and got me preg?      Im sort confused! Help!

Tiene como 20 dÃ­as de embarazo, pero no quiere tenerlo. Yo le he dado muchos consejos, le he dicho que no aborte, que no haga nada de lo que pueda arrepentirse, pero cuando se lo dije ya era tarde. Se tomÃ³ un menjurge que el imbÃ©cil de su novio le diÃ³ para que aborte. Lo tomÃ³ dos veces, y ahora no aguanta los cÃ³licos terribles que no puede ni levantarse. Yo se las consecuencias que puede traer eso pero no quiero decirle, no quiero asustarla. Le dije que vaya urgente con un ginecÃ³logo pero se niega rotundamente.

Ellos no estÃ¡n muy  bien econÃ³micamente, yo creo que eso fuÃ© lo que llevÃ³ a ella a tomar esas sustancias. Estoy muy preocupada, denme un consejo para poder ayudarla. Gracias.

20070524003142AAS0qC8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy scans?	Am i correct in thinking that if the scan date picked up my lmp that i conceived approximately 2 weeks later. If i conceived on my lmp then the scan dates would say my lmp was earlier? Me and my partner are trying roughly to work out a conception date.
20070524010143AAlW1sZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Would you be concerned if your hCG count was 75 IU/l 5 weeks after last period?	Hi there   I found out on Saterday that I am pregnant, had a Beta hCG test done on Tuesday, according to me I should be 5 weeks pregnant (from my last period).  Is a hCG count of 75 something to be concerned about.  p.s I have had no real pregnancy symptoms besides a period that's gone MIA!

20070602115016AA5D5qG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why am I such a worrier....?	I was in my car with my girlfriend, and she was rubbing my penis and after a little some clear-ish precum came out and I wiped it with a napkin and I dont know if she got any on her hand or finger, but then around 30 minutes at least later I brought her home and she went to the bathroom without washing her hands. And she's on her period so I think that she probably changed her tampon or something but she told me she just went to the bathroom and wiped herself with toilet paper. And she had stopped taking the birth control pill about a week before this. Would the birth control still be active until the last day of your period? I don't know if i'm just thinking about this way too much or something. But I'd appreciate your input on this situation. Even though it isn't much of one. IS there any chance at all she could be pregnant?? And since she stopped her birth control will her period come regularly on time next time it comes?
20070611031655AAQy2Uy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My cousin is pregnant, and she already has a baby that her and her husband never look after?	She wanted to have an abortion, but her Mother in law talked her out of it.  My cousin is a terrible Mom, and her Mom in law has the baby all the time, and she never looks after it properly either.  Don't you think she was wrong for talking her out of an abortion?  Like, this girl got drunk all the time and smoked when she was pregnant, she's on drugs and drinks all the time now, the babys always dirty, etc etc.  The mom in law just wants babies for herself, but she doesn't look after them well!  Do you think l should say something to my cousin?

20070620224634AA6F16x	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What is the accuracy rate of detecting precise EDD when having an ultra sound during the 1st trimester?	I am with child with my second baby. My first one was induced because I haven't had signs of giving birth even after the EDD calculated by my ob-gyne. My mens is very irregular that sometimes, I missed up 3 - 4 weeks.. During the month that I should have given birth, we had always had the ultra sound, but to my disappointment, the EDD varied from time to time. This is why my ob-gyne recommended an ultra sound right now that I am on my first trimester. Is this really necessary? Is there no other way of knowing the exact gestational age of my baby so we won't be worried about when should I give birth? Please, help... I told my doctor already that my cycle is really irregular, it just means that my ovulation period is also unpredictable. If I am not mistaken, late ovulation would also means late fertilization and delivery of baby.
