ct2uFkPNaa	Yes.  This is known amongst steroid users as "teeny weeny syndrome."  Testosterone in your bloodstream makes your penis plump up and look larger.  Babies have larger penises when they are born because of testosterone in the mother's bloodstream.  Then they get that little boy look until puberty kicks in, and then their penises get that fat adolescent look from testosterone even before they begin to grow.<br>  <br>  Testosterone is a steroid, so when you take other steroids, your body thinks it has enough steroids, and your testicles stop producing it.  This causes your penis to shrink.  When you stop taking the steroids, your penis returns to normal size.<br>  <br>  Take a look at pro wrestler Rick Rude in a pair of spandex tights.  His muscles are ripped, but his crotch area looks like he has a cashew nut for a penis.<br>  <br>  So don't take steroids.  They will also damage your organs, and give you cancer and heart trouble.|`|M63kq3AYaa	Yes, and does a lot more damage as well.|`|OVtUnuYnaa	idk ask Barry Bonds

I don't think there's a name for it, though some folks like to refer instead to the cause - bereavement, shock or stress for example.<br>  For a while after this sort of loss, your brain is trying to adjust so it's like a computer that's processing something & doesn't have as much memory available for you to use. You can't do much about it, your memory will sort itself out after a few months as you come to terms with your loss. Till then, go easy on yourself & just think of all these times you forget things as a way of saying how much you cared about your friend.

That will determine how long you need to exercise.<br>  I'm a runner;  if the race I'm training for is a marathon my workout is different than if it's a 5K.

sWLNSJJBaa	Part of the reason is that when you yawn, you squeeze you eyes tightly shut. The way that tears flow is that they come out of you lacrimal gland which is on the upper outer side of the top of your eye. They then flow in a film across your eye obliquely downwards and inwards. The tiny black dot on your lower eyelid is called a punctum, and that's where your tear duct starts. If you squeeze your eyelids tightly shut, you stop the tears flowing across your eye and into the tear duct and so they have to come out. This makes you cry a little bit, which is why tears come out when you yawn.|`|jXyLlZd1aa	This happens to ne all the time and then people will say why are you crying and I say oh I just yawned.|`|zmBSnT6iaa	well maybe its because you squeeze your eyes so water comes out because of the pressure

2NtwlyO2aa	Dear, do you mean the IV infiltrated?   <br>  <br>  Sometimes, it is hard to watch those we love go through all this, but remember, your grandma is 85 years old.  It sounds as if she had a vein that collapsed and the IV infiltrated which is not uncommon in women of that age.  There was nothing they could do.  The "bruise' is under the skin capillaries that probably ruptured.  Its normal.   <br>  <br>  I am sure the nurses are trying to do their very best.  Welcome to the real world.  Life is messy and upsetting and sometimes there is little you can do about things.  <br>  <br>  85 year old veins and skin bruise easily....believe me, I know. I have been a nurse for 35 years and I won't protect any nurse guilty of negligence, etc.  But this is not uncommon.  <br>  <br>  And please know that not all people survive long.  Your grandma is exceptional.  I hope she recovers but are you prepared if she doesn't ?   You need to be strong and happy for her sake.   <br>  <br>  what can you do for your grandma....visit her.  Talk to her and let her know that you love her.  Plump her pillows, hold her hand.  LIsten to her.  Maybe you could read to her or just chat....whatever you do, it will make her happy. <br>  <br>  I think you are super special to care so much already....not all people are that way/.  We often forget the elderly are still people with needs.  <br>  <br>  You are a GREAT person.  Congratulations for being one of the good ones.|`|6uyPNXFvaa	Maybe her vein collapsed; happen to my uncle who was in hospice. Take a matter of moments for that to happen. The fluid (bubble) is the IV solution under her skin, he body will absorb it. The law suit suggestions are ridiculous, (unless something really did happen) most people need to blame someone to justify the obvious, your grandma is 85 and her body doesn’t react the same as yours. You want to blame the nurses who you think should be at your grandmas side 24/7. remember that there are other patients too that need tending to.|`|hdagyZ6Taa	Same general thing happened to my grandfather and yes u can sue for Malpractice if she was not monitored properly.<br>  that is what we are doing but talk to ur lawyer because idk the specifics on ur granmother =D gl to u and to ur grandmother|`|PgDR15hsaa	Definitely hire a lawyer!|`|VeYdnLkOaa	sue the hospital|`|S7Ppy7qiaa	sue, it will pay off to hire a lawyer too|`|b3b3ec5d4f11dcc71222576cf5ec34c6aa	im not entirely sure but you should maybe talk to anyone you know in the medical practice. also pester the hospital, keep phoning and requesting doctors asking why this happened in the first place, get some answers and get her some better care. dont let it go though. my nan has just recently come out of hospital after being in for like 6 weeks, the first 2 they just left her in a ward and she didnt see a doctor at all in those 2 weeks and they actually admitted that they had put her on the wrong ward and we eventually got her moved after A LOT  of nagging. so keep at them and you should get some resuts|`|AA11599407	This is not negligence. The elderly have very thin fragile veins. During IV therapy the veins sometimes rupture and fluids then leak into the tissue which is what has happened here. It would only take a few minutes for enough fluid to infiltrate and cause the swelling you describe. Obviously nurses who are greatly overworked cannot watch all IV's continuously. Time will resolve this issue.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	This happened to me before.  It looks much worse than it is.  It just means that the needle slipped out and the blood welled up under her skin before it was caught.  Nurses are so shorthanded, and they would never do that on purpose.  It will go away on it's own.  I feel sorry that you have worried about this, but just keep an eye on your grandma.  She may have inadvertently pulled the needle out herself just by moving around.|`|RI1o1bvcaa	it depends how it happened. I'm not a doctor, so I'm not sure... but sometimes someone is to blame, and sometimes something happens that no one can explain. I think that you should just talk to her. Cahnces are shes scared, and just spending time with her in the hospital will make her feel more comforted.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped.|`|aa7dyq1aaa	You have a very good question. The IV is mostly being administered very poorly. Even with my little one(2 years) and my spouse they put it 2-3 times before getting it right.|`|p1mSR5Awaa	consult a lawyer who specializes in that area and ask him.|`|lqTbbTx2aa	Her IV became infiltrated. Unfortunately, it is very common and a risk of having IV therapy. It is just the IV fluid that has leaked outside of the vein. It will not make her sick or cause her any harm and the swelling will go down. Some states will even make the power of attorney sign a sheet before giving and IV to state the risks. She may have done this herself. This isn't a case of negligence. I'm sure the staff is aware of this and have taken care of the IV placement. Nurses work their butts off trying to take care of tons of patients at once. Instead of looking for reasons to try to sue, why not thank them for taking care of your grandmother? <br>  <br>  FYI-The nurses will show up in the room even more if you treat them kindly. When families seem like they are out to get every nurse who enters the room, it makes us all nervous to enter the room more than is required. Try to develop an open and kind relationship with them. Most nurses went into their profession because they LOVE what they do and genuinely care for all their patients. You will waste your time and money seeking legal help for something so miniscule.
w5SIOM2Haa	Because both are bad for you?  Because both are so expensive?  Either way, you may want to try a support group.

Get ready for sticker shock.  Things are going to be much more expensive, although salaries are higher.  First research where you want to live, then look online at sites like apartmentratings.com to get an idea of what your rent is going to be and which areas to avoid.  There are some great things about California...the weather, and the people are generally very cool and don't get in your business as long as you're not doing anything to hurt them.  Also, getting a job in the healthcare field probably won't be difficult, but do check out your options before you make the leap.

8asG4WCwaa	To the asker:  <br>  <br>  It is assumed that excess weight results in resistance to insulin, which makes it harder to transfer glucose to the body to be used as fuel.  That is not necessarily correct.  Fat cells do produce hormones, which, when there is an overabundance, might change insulin receptors in all cells.  Excess weight and insulin resistance may only be RELATED in a more complex problem (see metabolic syndrome, for example), not a for certain cause and effect. It is being researched.  Many type 2s are not overweight or "overfat" so the  assumption that fat causes diabetes does not account for them.  Excess weight may result from the specific cause of the insulin resistance, and there CAN be more than one cause of cell receptor alterations as well as faulty protein chain formation of the insulin itself.<br>  <br>  To the answerers who don't know better:  <br>  <br>  obesity is a risk factor, NOT a cause (many obese people are NOT diabetic)<br>  <br>  poor diet and lack of exercise is a risk factor, NOT a cause (many obese people DO eat healthy diets and DO exercise -- many normal weight people do NOT eat healthy and do NOT exercise--both groups have an equal chance of developing diabetes)<br>  <br>  there ARE other causes of obesity and those causes CAN result in diabetes even in the non-obese (like hypothyroidism, pituitary tumor, PCOS, etc)<br>  <br>  weight gain is common AS type 2 diabetes is developing (weight loss occurrs once the diabetes is out of control)<br>  <br>  Food does NOT cause diabetes - not candy, not soda, not potatos or rice (low carb diets are just another type of "medication" and NOT effective for all diabetics)<br>  <br>  Food does NOT cure diabetes either<br>  <br>  excess calories promote excess insulin AND excess fat storage even in non-obese people<br>  <br>  It IS possible (and it IS in the research) that the obese may begin as normal weight people with chronic exhaustion from other endocrine problems (like hypothyroidism), which would result in less exercise.  If insulin resistance also develops, it would cause increased hunger (as all diabetics know is a symptom of high sugar levels), leading to excess calories.  NOT treating the real cause is NOT the obese person's fault, allowing stereotypes to prevail instead of medical research IS society's fault.  .<br>  <br>  Fat cells DO produce hormones, therefore they ARE part of the complex endocrine system (what those hormones are and what role they play in the body, including any role in weight  gain, insulin resistance, and/or diabetes IS being researched)<br>  <br>  why and where fat cells accumulate in the body CAN impact it's affect/interaction with the body, organs, and systems (even in normal weight people - a fatty liver is just as bad for normal weight people as it is for the obese, for example).  <br>  <br>  Normal weight people CAN be "overfat" and unhealthy.  Overweight people CAN be healthy. The risk of diabetes is equal in both groups.<br>  <br>  Babies who were introduced to cerals too early because milk/formula alone was not satisfying have a greater chance of being overweight and/or diabetic as adults than the general population.  Research is begining to show that their systems may already be impaired (just not recognized under current standards and testing abilities) and the effect may accumulate as one ages - greater numbers of receptors or insulin protein chains becoming altered over time.<br>  <br>  Obesity and diabetes have commonalities<br>  ---genetics DO play a role in both<br>  ---endocrine dysfunctions DO play a role in both<br>  ---immune response to vrius infection (it IS in the research for both)<br>  ---stress response (it IS in the research for both)<br>  <br>  Different medications for diabetes work best for different people because of their genetics AND cause of the diabetes.  Even in type 2.  Not all type 2s get the same result from the same medications.<br>  <br>  Assuming that all type 2s are overwieght and that all overweight people get that way from lack of exercise and poor diets is IGNORANT.  It promotes stereotypes and harms society as a whole.  Try reading articles that are well researched and learning something.|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	there is more stress on t he organs the heavier that you are so t hey have to work harder, also they usually do not have the best or healthiest diets and contains high sugars and fats and overly processes foods partnered with the lack of exercise.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	Another answer is to look at it in the reverse, obesity is a side affect of diabetes, specifically insulin resistance, the body over compensates and stores extra fat because the muscles can not get the energy from the glucose in the blood.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	If only obese people are at risk, how come only half of the morbidly obese ever have even slightly elevated glucose levels?<br>  <br>  This is one of the myths of diabetes.

Their antioxidant numbers are off the charts in comparison to other high antioxidant foods, such as blueberries.  Antioxidants can help you lose weight as they destroy 'free radicals' in your body.  Free radicals bind themselves to fat cells, making it difficult to achieve weight loss.<br>  <br>  The antioxidants in acai berries, along with the rest of their nutritional makeup, also helps with keeping up energy.  This is why it's referred to as the 'new workout cocktail' according to Vogue magazine.<br>  <br>  You do not have to take the capsule format of the acai berry.  I've recently found a puree that actually works well and tastes wonderful.  Try Mona Vie.  This has the actual skins and pulp of the fruits used.  Juices without the skins and pulp lose a lot of their nutritional value.  You can also find a drink suited for you.  There is the regular version, one for more active people (glucosamine is added to promote joint health) and one for heart health (with omega-3).<br>  <br>  I personally know people that have seriously improved their health by taking acai berry and I am starting to take it myself.  One person that took the Mona Vie I was talking about for heart health actually lowered their cholesterol by over 100 points.  I hope you decide to try the acai berry!  I've heard and seen nothing but great things happening!|`|bDcawsx1aa	I have read that really help with weight loss.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Acai berries are used by the native Amazonian Indians to help them feel full when there's little other food.

EeTs9DqUaa	One of the things about diabetes is it hits everyone a little different.  Type 1's may go through a "honeymoon" phase where by injecting some insulin relieves some of the load on the Beta cells and they produce insulin for a while.  How long varies and you need to watch your readings because it can change quickly.  Talk this over with your doctor or diabetes educator.|`|A9MDoFooaa	being hypo or hyper glycemic - having low or high blood sugar - is not good for you if you have diabetes.<br>  <br>  You should have been told how much medication to take and also had some dietary information and advice - go back to your doctor - if you mess up with diabetes you can be very unwell.|`|OxARuPpCaa	A blood sugar of 321 is not low!

CkN4pgpCaa	I think you definitely have some issues and an obsession with food.  First off, you should be eating around 1500-1600 calories per day.  And keeping it all down!  If you aren't keeping food down because it makes you feel sick, then your problem is bulimia.  Throwing up food is never a good way to lose weight.  Stop thinking about calories like every one that you eat will turn to fat... you need to start thinking about them as a positive thing- in moderation.  They provide the energy for you to do physical activity (even just walking or going up the stairs).  Without them, you will be lazy and tired all the time... and feel sick.  Losing and maintaining weight is all about balancing physical activity with eating healthy.  You need to change your relationship with food- the right foods can give you the vitamins and energy that you need every day.  Food is not the enemy- just eat lots of fruits and vegetables and keep junk food to a minimum.  Consider talking to a counselor about this before it becomes really harmful to your health.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	Yes, calorie counting sends the wrong message to your body. I would not suggest anyone lose weight this way. By being overly restrictive on calorie counting it is unstable and very easy to starve oneself.<br>  <br>  You are starving yourself by not eating enough per day to support your body and you are doing even worse by regurgitating any food that you consume before it can be digested into the body.<br>  <br>  You are harming your body and most certainly fit all the traits of a bulemic. You need help. These models are probably no diffferent, a lot of thin models get trapped into dangerous eating disorders doing the same thing, and they are poor role models to girls who idolize them.<br>  <br>  You have to stop obsessing about weight, looks aren't everything, would you rather be thin and ill and take a toll on your looks or would you be a normal healthy weight and look healthy as well?|`|0ORr7sbtaa	just eat healthy and exercise and take  vitamins<br>  <br>  <br>  take care of your body...dont do all the dieting mess
R73aJ9qtaa	I don't believe in all out cardio for weight loss.  I may be wrong, but it sounds like this is what you did.  You did all out cardio, and diet.  It's exellent, but you weight too quickly.  It may look nice on a scale, but you don't know if you lost 60lbs of pure fat.  You may have lost 30 lbs of fat, and 30 lbs of muscle.  If you don't lift, or strength train you probably lost a nice chunk of muscle.  It is always recommended to do cardio in conjunction with a good strength training regime.  Since you are at a nice weight now (180 is pretty low for 6'1".  It's 10 lbs below "normal" on the bmi), I would suggest bumping cardio to 2-3 times a week.  I would do something like mon, we, friday weights.  Tuesday, Thursday, Sat cardio.<br>  <br>  Try this out for a month or two.<br>  <br>  Squat 10-12<br>  Bench Press 10-12<br>  Shoulder Press 10-12<br>  Upright Row 10-12<br>  Bent Over Row 10-12<br>  Triceps Kickback 10-12<br>  Leg Extensions 10-12<br>  Biceps Curls 10-12<br>  Hamstring Curls 10-12<br>  <br>  Start with one set, and build up to 2-3.  Start with 1:30/2:00 minutes rest.  Then Decrease your rest between workouts/sets to 30-60 secs.  Make sure you get at least 50% of your bodys weight in protein per gram (ex 180 = 90g's of protein a day).  Your body lost weight, but the flab is there because you didn't sustain that muscle.  Time to rebuild that foundation bro.

U89rnpiGaa	First of all, your skin needs to be very, very bad in order for a good doctor to prescribe this med.  You don't seem to know much about it.  If u do go on it - be prepared to exp. severe side effects - you can't go in the sun, certain meds cannot be mixed - you must get blood work done every couple of months and it can cause very dry skin as well.  You need to have a really good consultation with a good dermotologist first and then they will help you decide if this is the right treatment - it can work wonders but I would only do this as a last resort - both my kids were on it - but they had severe facial acne which would have produced bad scars - so they went on it.  It cleared their acne but the drug is powerful and they had a lot of bad side effects.  By the way, you would get a prescription from the dermo and then have it filled at a pharmacy.  Hope you have a drug plan also as it is not that cheap.  good luck.|`|tSi10jneaa	Well the doctor who prescribes should be able to tell you.<br>  By the way it isn't good idea to go on accutane.<br>  <br>  www.topix.com/forum/health/TK0HVONNQAV...

If you are diabetic too, tell your doc about your temperature.  It is possible that you have the beginnings of neuropathy which will make your feel cold.  Just have them rule that out.|`|TdRgGCJPaa	Well, people always seem to tell me that my feet are cold, and so are my hands. I am on synthyroid as well, and I feel like I have alot of energy.

Zhp3oFiUaa	You're younger, you pretty much just started. It's going to be irregular until about 14-15 years of age. Buy a calendar and put a little x on the day you start and put the x's for the days it lasts till it ends then you can kind of predict when it'll start. So your's will probably start this month and be irregular for awhile.|`|936dFoLeaa	It is probably because you just started. Periods take a while to regulate. This is about the 4th question I have mentioned PCOS (polysistic ovary syndrome) in, so here's a little info.<br>  <br>  I started my period at 12/13 and within 8 months my periods became irregular, and then completely absent without birth control to regulate them. I was diagnosed at age 14 or 15 (cant remember) with PCOS, it causes irregular/absent periods and many other symptoms. I'm not trying to worry you, but you should just look into it. It helps if it's caught early on so you don't get further damage like endometriosis & other problems like infertility. <br>  <br>  It has to be diagnosed by a doctor, who will perform the routine lab work if you have signs/symptoms.<br>  <br>  Here's a website with info, it's a support site. Those who have been diagnosed are welcome, as well as those who have not. :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.soulcysters.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.soulcysters.net</a> <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ui7WuDrJaa	It's all good, our periods don't really become regular after a while (or they might even never get regular, which it's ok too, nothing to worry about).

9SXnUOb3aa	Because they're too lazy to diet?
b2K8vZXNaa	well the best way to lose fat is to burn it right? so you would need to do some cardio, maybe try an olyptical machine, or what i used to do was walk everyday at least a mile. After you get used to that and it becomes easy switch to jogging that mile, then switch to running. when you got that down then increase the distance. drink plenty of green tea, milk, water, and eat well... stay ontop of it and you'll look fabulous :)|`|4XRKoGDWaa	dont bother wasting your money on gym memberships. do sit ups/stomach crunches at home, take brisk walks and eat sensibly|`|8PDzaAJcaa	There should be a trainer at the gym that can help you get started on a workout regime.

I was warned by friends and my orthodontist never to wear yellow or clear bands on the brackets, because the clear turn yellow and the yellow looks like sick in your teeth...nice ey! ;)

It increases awareness.  Its like drinking five Red Bulls.  In a state of sexual arousal, this kicks in, your heart beats faster to send more blood to the small blood vessels nearer the surface of your skin and, unfortunately, away from your brain.  There is nothing wrong with jerking off, so don't worry about it.  Maybe what's causing your anxiety is a little guilt about this?  Its perfectly normal, its perfectly acceptable.

2quTUoA6aa	Let's hope that you didn't something worse than pregnancy!|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Wrong.|`|GmTs1BB1aa	You might.<br>  just because your on your period doesn't lower the chances.<br>  and have you ever heard of pre-ejeculation ?|`|RMZ21EUuaa	There is always a chance. Having sex unprotected is irresponsible on your period or off. <br>  <br>  Some girls ovulate WHILE on their period. The pull out method doesn't work most of the time, because 'stuff' comes out before the male ejaculates. You COULD be pregnant. Not as high of a chance but def. a chance.|`|iUFIlbNgaa	wrong.  If you've started your period, no matter when you have sex, you could get pregnant, however during your period and directly after your period is a bit less likely.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	don'y kid yourself, you would tell anyone else in your situation that they could be preg and to take a test.<br>  so go take a test.<br>  get on birth control and use condom's from now on seriously... those aren't even 100% but they are closer than pulling out..<br>  pre-*** have sperm in it.|`|5RoYyprkaa	You shouldn't be having unprotected sex on your period just because of the risk of infection. But while it is unlikely, it's still possible.|`|tQO9LW8Qaa	Don't have unprotected sex. Period. You need to be protected from STDs and so does he.<br>  <br>  Pulling out does not prevent you from getting pregnant, and, yes, you can get pregnant during your period. There is no predictable time during your cycle that you can safely say, "if I have sex now I won't get pregnant." <br>  <br>  You should visit your doctor, a gynecologist that your doctor recommends, or a free clinic to have a talk about safe sex and to be tested for STDs.|`|ievQ3ASOaa	Yes. You can still get pregnant. I didn't think people could get pregnant on their periods but my mom was on hers on her wedding night, and nine months later there I was. So, yea you can get pregnant. Even if he pulled out you could still get pregnant from pre ***.<br>  <br>   Then again, I heard that if the man urinates before sex if kills the sperm so you couldn't get pregnant from the pre ***. I don't know if that's true but yes you can get pregnant on your period. Sorry dude..|`|HzCBOwlyaa	nooooo you can not get pregnant on your period!<br>  answer this did he *** inside of you? if he did there is a very very very SMALL chance ..if he didnt dont worry.<br>  <br>  its a fact you CANT get pregnant during your period ( 3 days before or 3 days after ! thats the red zone ! )|`|27MRNeH4aa	No.  You won't get pregnant.  But just for peace of mind, don't do that again.  There is about a one in a billion chance it could happen.  Who needs the stress?!|`|AA10563860	nope.  during your period your endometrium is removed and will take almost 12 days to grow back enough to allow proper implantation of a fertilized egg.|`|40bfa85dc1438948fddb7122eee50ce1aa	WOW..dats kinda nasty..i say u have less than 10% chance of gettin pregnant..u needa be worried about a disease,u could atleast used a condom if u was goin to have sex on yo period.|`|wF3Znuodaa	I've heard its possible. So maybe you  might wanna wait for your period to see if it comes if not then you know why.|`|SJYKFeyeaa	It is very possible, but its more of a smaller change then if you were not on your period, because your egg or whatever they call it breaks, when on your period. but it still is possible. And to top it off you shouldnt have sex on your period, cause that can lead to infection|`|vlzI765eaa	pulling out is only about 50-70% effective.<br>  you should take a "morning after" or "plan b" pill to decrease your risk of pregnancy.|`|ntWaO5Bbaa	ewww man.<br>  having sex on your period is so nasty! <br>  Blood blood blood.|`|8CvWbN5Caa	there is always a chance you can get pregnant!<br>  <br>  unprotected sex = babies<br>  <br>  be smart... good luck :)|`|FiU2G8qbaa	you already are pregnant.|`|EZOsxV4Iaa	It is always a possibility.

ufgv7oTjaa	Well, yes, it would depend on the pill. There are some pills that would lose some of their integrity if you boiled them and there are pills that would be almost pointless if you broke or crushed them (mostly enteric coated or time-released pills).<br>  That being said, as long as they aren't coated pills or the bottle doesn't say to not crush/cut them, you could break the pills up and just mix them into regular water (not boiling) and that would give the best benefit if you couldn't swallow the pills. Alternately, you could always check with the doctor or pharmacist and see if a liquid option is available for any of those medications. Good luck and I hope I helped!
FicyC2TXaa	Sorry to hear about your dad.<br>  <br>  Hereditary cancer is rare; fewer than 10% of cancer cases are hereditary.<br>  <br>  You don't inherit a general tendency to get cancer, and isolated cases of cancer in a family, or several family members having different types of cancer, isn't a sign of heredity.<br>  <br>  A sign that cancer MAY be hereditary within a family is when several members of the same side of the family have had the SAME type of cancer, especially if some developed it at a younger than usual age.<br>  <br>  Nobody knows what causes cancer; when people tell you it's diet and lifestyle, this is a reflection of their own fears and prejudices (and their lack of knowledge about cancer).<br>  <br>  It's often less scary for some one who hasn't had cancer to 'blame the victim' in this way than it is for them to accept that cancer is a largely random disease that can happen to any of us at any time|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	Some cancers are lifestyle related. For example, some cancers are unheard of in populations that are active and eat low-fat vegetarian diets. Exposure to chemicals and radiation can be a hazard.<br>  <br>  I'd check with your physician if you are concerned. Sometimes, you can make changes that will minimize your risk.|`|LDxMBcktaa	Well, I don't think cancer is in the genes as much, its more just lifestyle. However, it depends on information about the cancer that took your dads life. But i would advise you to just not worry about it and if your overly concerned see your G.P. They will gladly provide you with more information and even test you if you wish for it.|`|ORKdBy4Naa	10% of cancers are hereditary, 30% from lack of diet and exercise, is that enough for you?If you eat healthy , and exercise chances are you won't get cancer.

(use the antifungal until it is completly gone first)|`|VXcp8hvHaa	gross ferret face you are one nasty little girl|`|CkUjIA1maa	Yes, it's actually pretty common with "innies".  Just use the cream as directed and it will clear up fine.  You may even want to try using Oil of Oregano (buy it at a health food store) externally on the navel, and internally (a few drops by mouth a couple times a day.)  I won't lie - the stuff tastes terrible, but it's an excellent antimicrobial and can kill yeast, bacteria and viruses. It contains Cavracol, a natural phenol that kills germs.|`|j8y8kcbNaa	no, it does not happen often as the majority of people do not go long enough without washing that yeast can manifest itself in a navel.

You can't get it somewhere else?  if you can't get any more, you just can't get any more until then.  You can manage.|`|6uQh4VSpaa	It sounds kind of risky to me.  The half-life of lamictal is 24-34 hours -- what that means, is that from the last dose, the amount in your body decreases by half every day or so.  So, by Tuesday, you will have almost none left in your system.  Fortunately, there are no withdrawal symptoms reported, but you might experience a worsening of your mood symptoms.  I'd call your doctor, and ask him if he can phone in another prescription.|`|67NqWxuGaa	You should be, ask the pharmacist or doctor<br>  Also if your depression increases on the meds get off of them right away...

Both are drying, pain relieving and antiseptic. Need to be diluted in olive oil or other carrier oil. Both burn a bit when applied to an open sore, but then stop the pain and help heal. The carrier oil helps counter the excessive drying effect. You can buy camphor already diluted in a product called Camphophenique.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	Theres for oils you can use for Cold Sore Treatment.  <br>  <br>  Tea tree oil, cloves, star anise, and licorice have all been recommended as home remedies and cold sore remedies either because of their numbing effects, their antiseptic qualities, or both.<br>  <br>  Also Melissa (Lemon Balm) is good for cold sores as well.  <br>  <br>  Allergic to a lot of antibiotics and have to use what I can sometimes.

hfodUPg9aa	For red-looking stretch marks, Retin-A cream (prescribed by a dermatologist) may give some subtle improvement in reducing the redness by causing blood vessels to constrict. Once the redness fades, the red stretch marks become white stretch marks. Unfortunately, no topical lotion will eliminate the marks completely.<br>  <br>  For permanent removal. A dual laser treatment performed at a dermatologist's office. The combination of lasers stimulates new collagen and elastic fiber growth to fill in where the marks are. After 3 to 5 treatments, with mild bruising and swelling, the marks should significantly improve, if not disappear completely.<br>  <br>  The downside: Each treatment costs about $395.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|280jfiLOaa	idk|`|t5Oi7zRbaa	im not sure but same with me
S5ZYHiFaaa	to answer your first question, no, they will not let you in without a card. they are very professional people, and if they even let you in the dispensary without a medical card, they are not only putting their business at risk, but their freedom.<br>  <br>  and this will answer your second question as well. there are no officially licensed dispensaries that will allow you to buy from them. again, they don't give a rat's a$$ about you, by doing that they would be putting their freedom at risk. if they were caught selling it to you, they would be charged for not only what they sold to you, but what they have in the store, and that is a lot of weed, enough to give a life sentence to everyone who worked at that store.|`|Sh7r0kNuaa	you must have a card to buy from a medical marijuana dispensary, you must have a card to enter the establishment. and of course they wont let you but it for recreational purposes. its called "medical" marijuana. even if there are people who have medical marijuana that don't have a valid reason, they still have the card and as far as the law is concerned, they use it medicinally.
Vwc1f7VKaa	I used to do pilates and yes it is more difficult than yoga.Yoga is basically meditating and not a lot of work gets done so I recommend pilates if you want to exercise. Sometimes it's also fun ;)|`|rZHaYIssaa	I've done both pilates and yoga and have enjoyed both. People don't generally believe yoga is muscle building but holding a pose for 30 seconds engages every muscle. Balance is key in yoga which can give great benefits. So yoga is very relaxing, stimulating and still quite a fair workout - depending on which program you choose. You might want to browse around a bit or look into some videos.<br>  <br>  Pilates is more cardio, up-tempo and I usually do that when I want to get in shape fast. fit TV provides GREAT pilates work outs and I enjoy them as well, but I tend to favor yoga a bit more. It allows me to de-stress.

(this is an EXTREMELY RARE occurrence and in all likelihood will probably NEVER happen to you)  and even if it did, it wouldn't negatively affect you in any way.  the clitoris acts much like the male penis in that it grows larger and harder when the female is sexually stimulated or aroused.  in my view, this would most likely only serve to increase your pleasure.<br>  <br>  don't worry, babe.  your brother was a jerk.  just forget about it and as the song said:  be happy.<br>  <br>  after all, life is way too important to be taken seriously.|`|jCy4s9y3aa	i recommend that you go to tesco and buy a very big cucumber and before you fall asleep put it between your legs so when you wake up, you find what's been annoying you and finally you wont think about it again. logical answer for stuped question. you should've asked your parents not the public.|`|oEF46EZRaa	Honey...you are not going to grow a penis.

jnOiqcAlaa	In my anatomy class, we were going over the digestive system. In the small intestine, a body produces enzymes that helps digest certain things. She said that sometimes the body will randomly stop making a certain enzyme for no reason, and could start back up at any time. I actually had this problem before. I used to be lactose intolerant when I was younger, but I'm not anymore. So maybe this is what's causing it? Eh, it's worth looking into.
dFHsAXDMaa	Okay as a nurse I will tell you that is too much of a calorie deficiency to be healthy and get all the vitamins you need. If you go to a web site that tell you the amount of calories you should be taking in according to your height and weight say you are 5'2" and you weigh 160 lbs for example  you should be taking in 2600 calories to sustain you body if you take away 1600 calories a day out of that it leaves you 1,000 calories to consume each day  and creating a deficiency of 1600 will allow you to loss 45 lbs in 90 days.. the key is eating 5 times a day in the morning eat half a bagel with fat free Cream cheese and piece of fruit and glass of low fat or skim milk  about 2 hours after that have a granola bar or fiber bar and water  2 to 3 hours after that lunch something like a lean cuisine sandwich or two slices of turkey cut up on 3 cup of  spinach salad Spinach ( only 21 calories in spinach but lots of vitamins) with a 2 tbsp of oil and vinegar. and a yogurt.... afternoon 2 hours later have a piece of fruit or cottage cheese... and 2 or 3 hours after that but definitely 3 hours before bed eat dinner something  like steamed veggies and white meat like a lean pork or chicken. <br>  <br>  You will loose more weight like this if you do not eat  healthy and often enough and frequently ... you will actually gain weight because your metabolism will slow down to a rate where it is not processing anything. if you want to loose weight do it the right way...<br>  <br>  <br>  you can go to this web site for useful tools and aanswers to dieting questions    <a href="http://www.my-calorie-counter.com/tools.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-calorie-counter.com/tools....</a>|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	You will end up with the bones/body internally of an old lady if you restrict your diet so heavily.

e9jXrqfdaa	If you go in nice and relaxed it doesn't hurt a bit, I've given blood many times and it's a great feeling to know that the doctors will use it to really help someone when they need it the most.Please don't let a fear of needles put you off going. Nobody likes needles but really it doesn't hurt  you should do some breathing exercises before you go in and I bet that if you just sit there close your eyes and calmly take 10 big slow deep breaths, you wont even feel the needle going in. Just think one day you could need to have a blood transfusion and the doctors rely on people going to donate blood.|`|Run7dyraaa	NO, not at all. I just had 6 teeth pulled this morning with no anesthesia. If I can do that (I'm a girl) you can give blood. Piece of cake.|`|edzU8VJiaa	It doesn't hurt - just a little prick when the needle goes in (surely you've had at least a couple of little pricks in your life?)<br>  <br>  You'll have a tiny amount of blood taken from a finger first, to test you're not anaemic.  Then you lie down (hint: don't look at the needle going in or what's going on afterward - that's why most people get faint) and have a lovely nurse who looks after you all the time.  After a few minutes, it's all over, and as it's your first time, you'll probably be told to stay lying down for a few minutes more.<br>  <br>  Then you can get up and will get a drink (a cold one, not tea, as it's your first time; a hot drink can cause you to feel faint, too, if you are already nervous) and you'll probably be offered a biscuit.<br>  <br>  Once the nurses are sure you're ok, you can leave, feeling very smug and heroic.<br>  <br>  Just as a matter of interest, the number of female blood donors is much higher than male donors.  I was told that this is because men are so much more frightened of needles than women, and also not so altruistic.  (Don't know if this was true).<br>  <br>  Do make sure you keep the appointment; blood donor numbers are falling, and I am so glad you are kind enough to do this.|`|mnn8hYbtaa	There are a few stupid answers on here. If they are trying to put you off then they are daft. If they were ever in need of a transfusion they would gladly take it but they wouldn't have the guts to actually give a pint themselves.<br>  I have been donating blood for a few years now. I hate needles and although I can't say I enjoy the experience I wouldn't say it actually hurt. The worst part is when the needle goes in but I never look at it and the nurses talk to me while they do it. They know I'm nervous so they talk to me to put me at ease. Sometimes I get a tiny bruise on my arm but it doesn't swell up and I've never heard of that happening to anyone. The feeling afterwards that I could be saving a life is brilliant and I would recommend everyone should try donating at least once.  I find I bleed quicker if I've had plenty to drink so in the couple of hours before you donate try to drink a few glasses of water or squash. Good luck, don't worry, you will be fine.|`|iuY0sIL9aa	It all depends on the person. Fear is your worst enemy in this case.<br>  <br>  There is a little bit of a stick when the needle goes in.  Pinch yourself real hard in the elbow area where the needle goes in - nothing worse than that.<br>  <br>  Relax - don't look at the needed when they stick you/after it's in. Ask them to cover it up if necessary.<br>  <br>  Of course, don't move your elbow when needle is in. You will probably have a little ball to squeeze every few seconds.<br>  <br>  Perhaps bring an mp3 player or something that will distract you a little.<br>  <br>  Think about all the juice/cookies you get after donating.<br>  <br>  All will be fine.<br>  <br>  Again, relax, don't worry, and it's not bad at all.|`|K2dNndE2aa	i think it might hurt like a regular needle at first, but since it's in your arm for a couple minutes it gets better.<br>  <br>  i got my belly button pierced and it didn't hurt that much, but the lady was like "yeah most people come in thinking it's gonna be the worst thing they'll ever experience then when they get it they're like "oh that didn't hurt that bad" so maybe if you go in with that attitude it won't hurt as much?|`|30e7b808304ee867ce23c80d9216a4c6aa	I've given over 40 'pints' of blood in the UK (I'm pretty ancient). The first time I went was my 18th birthday. Back then, that was the age you had to be before you were allowed to donate.<br>  <br>  These days, they ask you if you want a little painkiller where the needle is going to be put in, but I suppose because I've been so many times, I'm used to the tiny amount of pain. It's really such a tiny pin-prick, if you don't look you'll barely notice it.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you eat and drink before you go. A sandwich or something substantial but definitely a drink (not alcohol!!!). I've found that helps prevent the light-headed feeling you sometimes get. You have to fill some forms in and read some information about what's going to happen and where your blood may be used. They don't normally keep first timers waiting all that long.<br>  <br>  They'll give you a little blood test where they prick your thumb (or finger) and drop it in some liquid to see if you've got high/low blood pressure and if it sinks, you're fine to give blood. <br>  <br>  They take you to the couch section of the room where they'll get you settled down with your arm laid out on a little arm rest. They'll check your name and birthdate (because that info is written on all your samples), put a tight band above your elbow and tap the inside of your elbow to find a vein. A nurse will then very gently slide the needle into the vein and you honestly will hardly feel anything except a tiny pin-prick as the needle goes past your nerve endings.<br>  <br>  They give you a bobbin shaped thing to squeeze, to help the blood flow quickly and before you know it, they're taking the needle out and making you sit with your finger over the dressing. They let you lay there for about 5 - 10 minutes and then they'll ask you to stand up. If you feel remotely weak or lightheaded, Tell them!!!! Don't try and be brave, because the floor is a hard place to land on when you fall! They'll just lay you down again for another 5 - 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  When you're ready, there's usually a table with biscuits and drinks and I would strongly advise that you go and sit there and have a couple of drinks and as many chocolate biscuits as you can get away with eating before they stop you (heh heh!!!). Seriously, have a drink and a biscuit. It gives you a bit more time to adjust and also you can check out what you've just been doing, by watching the other donors. It's quite interesting the way they weigh the blood, rock and squeeze the bags.<br>  <br>  Don't be worried if the blood takes AGES to come out. Next time, try the other arm. I have a 'good arm' and a 'bad arm', I've no idea why. With my right arm, I can be on and off the bed within 10 minutes, With the left arm, I'm lucky if they get the full bag of blood in half an hour! So I've learned to donate from only my right arm.<br>  <br>  Also don't be worried if you feel faint afterwards. For quite a few years I needed a longer recovery time and learned to just enjoy the rest! Now, I'm fine. My son went for his first time about 6 years ago and he actually passed out as he was sitting eating his biscuit! He was overjoyed to have all his fantasies come true when he came round, on a mattress on the floor surrounded by nurses! He's been fine since though.<br>  <br>  You're doing a wonderful thing. There is a chance that the blood you donate will save someone's life. What can be more important than that? It's worth a bit of discomfort.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you xx|`|HyBtZ4LIaa	Not really. When you give blood, just dont look at the needle because you will see them draining the blood from your veins. You might be a little nervous but as soon as the needle is in and out you will ask yourself why you got yourself so worked up. Its just a little prick and then its over.<br>  <br>  Having said that, If you are queesy, then i wouldnt give blood. If the queesiness is from being nervous then still do it, because they should give you a snack afterwards to keep your blood levels up.|`|NtwlsAhUaa	well i had to give blood when i had mono but i'm gonna guess its like the same thing. It doesn't hurt if you dont think about it. If you say in your head "omg this is gonna hurt this is gonna hurt" then it probably will. You're probably just queezy because you are going to give blood. All that happens is the find a blood vain. Your strongest one. And they poke the needle in and take it out. It shouldn't be as painful as you think it will be.|`|AA11822515	I thought I was going to pass out. I absolutely hate needles too. But I thought the only way to get over it would be to give blood. I won't lie - for the first couple of minutes, it's a little bit freaky. After a minute or two though, you just forget it's happening. It got me over my phobia. Nice nurses gave me tea and biscuits. It's for a good cause.<br>  <br>  Just go for it. If needs be, hold your breath and close your eyes for 30 seconds. It's not so bad.|`|wsctLFBSaa	it doesn't hurt no, but you feel very faint afterwards, and they shouldn't let you leave untill you feel better. but don't worry it's a lovely thing to do and after you will feel great because you have saved a persons life, with your blood!!!!|`|aJ54GCblaa	The needles aren't that big and it's really rewarding.<br>  I've only done it twice and got a slight bruise last time, but it's really not as painful as it sounds, they make it comfortable and look after everyone :)<br>  It's worth giving it a go!|`|pN0N0xjkaa	if you give blood from your arm, it gets swollen afterwards|`|Hzb3hrZ5aa	If you think needles Hurt!!|`|153SmUNmaa	i've always hated needles, and for me personally, i find that i can get through the pain if i <br>  a) dont look at the process<br>  b)make sure i relax my arm, tensing up will make it worse<br>  c) breathe deeply<br>  <br>  Hmm for what it feels like, there's a tiny pinch and then you feel this slightly bothersome object (needle) in your arm. It never really bothers me too much as long as I dont dwell on it so much, so basically, it only hurts more if focus all ur energy on it. Just relax and think of something your looking forward to, like seeing an attractive guy again, or hanging out with friends on the weekend, yada yada.<br>  <br>  Nowadays I've noticed I start laughing like a crazy person when i get injected with needles.<br>  <br>  Anyways, hope I helped. Good luck! Be over before ya know it.

ybhaH2voaa	I would think that it would depend on what areas you are trying to lose it from and the type of exercise you are using to burn fat. Walking is the best form of exercise and the simpleist. Also, watch the fats, carbs and sweets and focus on fresh fruits, veggies and lean meats such as chicken, fish and even turkey, plus be sure to drink plenty of water.

I dont want to offend you, but I think you should look on youtube for a video of how to use one...|`|Ro666eg7aa	i cant help you.<br>  but ill tell you this<br>  if you are below the age of 20 then you than you are just a complete idiot.|`|RNphimj4aa	You should really get a pregnancy test, their like 15-20 bucks at your local drugstore, and it sounds like you should switch to the pill instead of the patch, the patch is new and there are a lot of unkown side affects to it. Also about the plan B, not its not good to take it so often, and you could get really dangerous side affects like blood clots, and be at risk for cervical cancer. You should probably start seeing an OBGYN doctor.

That way if you are ever sick, you would be able to tell the doctor what is "normal" for you and what might be different when you are ill. . If you need to see a doctor for an illness, he will ask about your bowel movements. Also, you would want to know if you had any bleeding with it.

I am sure the real reason he did not tell you about the new meds is that would be not only admitting that he has a mental illness, but would open up the possibility of you not loving him anymore. Most people still avoid people that have a mental illness, and he is afraid that you will have the same reaction. It sounds ridicules to you, but people like me and your husband think differently than other people. <br>  Now when it comes to the increased restroom visits, as long as it does not start to affect his health, don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  Now for W A, ignore this person. People that have never lived with mental illness have no idea what it is like. They believe that it is no big deal, or is "all in our head", not a real problem. What they don't know is mental illness is caused by either too much or too little of certain chemicals in the brain, thereby not allowing it to work correctly. This is not something that can be fixed by diet, or meditation or any of the other ridicules ideas I have heard. The only way to improve the condition is to either provide synthetic chemicals, or reduce the production of the other chemicals. This can only be done with medication. <br>  <br>  I wish that people that do not know what they are talking about would just keep their mouth's shut.

But the thing is, at the end of the day, it's simply an erection. Your penis doing what it was made to do. Is that embarrassing at times? Yes! Will you die from shame? Hardly.<br>  <br>  Going commando is part of learning to like yourself, and accept that your body *prefers* as natural a state as possible. Sure, when it's cold, you want to be warm, so warm clothing is a good idea, but otherwise, nude/commando is best. Your skin likes to be able to breathe. It's much more natural than wearing tight synthetic clothing, containing pesticide residues, etc.<br>  <br>  It'll take a while to get used to, but in time, you'll be glad you did.|`|72iZuDjeaa	when i started to go commando i had the same issue... just pull your junk up in your waistband when that happens... you will go down soon enough, it's really uncomfortable for me anyway... it's a liberating feeling when your used to it ;-) i don't suggest it for the workplace though, i actually had it mentioned at a performance review ;-o... i wear boxer briefs for work these days ;-)<br>  <br>  kinder thoughts ;-)|`|SltEwVX7aa	like you're gonna hide it any more with boxers?  no support or anything else to those, either.  just tuck the erection in your waistband, like you'd do with any other pants/underwear.  <br>  <br>  why would I feel self conscience about going commando?

tGEMwgyBaa	No...you should not wear the football mouth-guard at night. There are a few reasons why. First, did you get the mouth-guard at a sporting goods store or did you get it made at the dentist? The dentist would have told you not to wear it at night and to only wear it when playing sports. These types of mouth guards are large and keep the back of your throat somewhat open. If you try and swallow at night with it in, you may choke on your own spit. If you are grinding  your teeth at night then you need a night guard which is a lot different than a football guard. They are smaller and accommodate your mouth to fit just right. They are custom made to fit right there in the dental office. So please, don't use the football guard at night, trust me, I work in a dental office and I know the difference between the two. I hope this helped you out.|`|tEpR9kr1aa	I wear a  dental retainer at night and that is smaller than a Football mouth gaurd soo yes.|`|eTq3ELVTaa	Yes|`|n8UBfhgpaa	i wouldnt do it|`|I38WF5aFaa	I don't see how you could choke and die but I do see a risk for injury or orthodontic damage.

769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	Are your parents the understanding or abusive type?  If not abusive, then tell them.  They will likely insist you quit but hopefully help you do so.  Also, going through nicotine withdrawal causes many many symptoms (headache, nausea, foul mood, etc.).  If they know what you're going through, they may be more forgiving of your behavior and helpful by buying products to make it easier on you.|`|AA11569882	That's alright, I smoked when I was fifteen too.  Hopefully you'll grow out of it.  I expect your parents already know, the smell is very pungent and no matter how much deodorant you spray on yourself they can probably tell.<br>  <br>  Don't tell them though, you aren't planning on making this a habit are you?

The reason behind that is it will actually help you smoke less if you're uncomfortable smoking around your parents, or uncomfortable that they'll smell it on you. <br>  <br>    Kind of like bars banning smoking inside, greatly helped me quit smoking as I got used to going out and not being allowed to cover myself by a cloud of smoke. Also, after a while freezing my buttocks to smoke outside got really old.|`|cMey6bumaa	Ok, if you are to confront your parents about this you need to be extremely Professional, don't just try to pass it off during a conversation, arrange a date to talk to both of your parents in a non distracting environment and take this seriously.

It will be hard. But first, think to yourself, "Why am I smoking?" and "What are the consequences?" Now breathe deeply. Are these really good answers? Be honest with yourself. Don't make yourself believe that they are good reasons if they really aren't. Peer pressure? Depression? Popularity? It's "cool"? To be happy? These are not good reasons, and there are many more bad reasons. Stop smoking. Whisper that to yourself whenever you have a craving.<br>  <br>  Think about the consequences. Shortened life. Others will die of second-hand smoking. Being Arrested. Cancer. You know the consequences. Get rid of all cigarettes. Think about who you will be hurting. Think about yourself as a person. Like who you are. Be happy. You don't have to smoke to do anything, besides hurting people. Don't think that you have to smoke. No one forces you, even under peer pressure, you make the decision, not someone else. You can be happy without smoking. My wish for you is to stop, though the decision is yours. <br>  <br>  Tell your parents. Be honest and stern. Of course they will be angry, but they will always love you. They can help you. They are the ones that can help you. But the one that can help you the most is yourself, and yourself only. Only you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, the question is not "Do you want to smoke?"<br>  <br>  The question is<br>  <br>  Do you want to smoke, accepting all consequences?<br>  <br>  If you said yes, I'm sorry and you may continue, but let the lives you shorten be heard whenever you breathe the smoke of a cigarette.<br>  <br>  If you said no, I'm glad you're willing to change, and you got the biggest thing needed to quit smoking, a determined will.|`|83fe3aa603aeb5f0a66147482fa68a47aa	U didnt say u had any intention of quitting in ur question.

FgPZ8Sl8aa	- Marijuana has not caused one death in the history of it's use, and there is no link to marijuana use and cancer.<br>  <br>  - It's not known to be physically addicting like caffeine, prescription medicines, alcohol or tobacco.<br>  <br>  - There are few physical risks associated with marijuana use. The act of smoking is never healthy for you. No, lung diseases are caused by marijuana use, however lower lung capacity and higher chance of getting chest colds are a reality for heavy users. Other methods of ingestion are available for those concerned about those risks (vaporizing, edibles, tinctures, etc).|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	I don't really advise it.  <br>  <br>  The first problem is the risk inherent with any legislated criminal behavior.<br>  <br>  Some people, admittedly, seem to function in spite of using it and they generally outgrow street drugs.  Some few may be correct that they just about "need it" to function, but I wonder if there isn't a better way.  And some people fall into a life of couch potatohood and Oreos, saving all ambitions and goals until a tomorrow that never seems to come.<br>  <br>  The worst thing about young people smoking dope is that at a time they should be learning some serious life-coping skills (for which, believe me, there will always be a need!), they are escaping their realities, and the problems start to accumulate. They don't call it wasted for nothing.  Speaking of waste,  stronger than normal is not a great idea either.   Also, there is a very small group of people who get psychotic on marijuana.<br>  <br>  Marijuana is not, strictly speaking, physically addictive.  But you may have a tendency towards addictions or "addictive behavior".  Other than taking the risks I've mentioned, I don't believe there is anything inherently harmful in smoking it once.<br>  <br>  So it is really a matter of risk.  You can risk whatever you want, you can go with what you perceive as "the odds",  you can weigh the possible payoff vs possible consequences.  I myself am not willing to put at risk things I am not perfectly willing to lose.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  Shotta, you are a little full of yourself here.  I have problems with a couple of your statements.  1.  The big one: you are using YOUR experience as some sort of benchmark.  It's not.  It's called "anecdotal".  2.  Who in the world???  would call an industrious 3.8 GPA at a prestigious demanding institutions stupid, lazy or dumb?  3.  Your mention of alcohol and tobacco, while true, are absolutely extraneous.  4.  Cannabis, like aspirin and and St. John's wort amongst many, are plants used as "drugs".  5.  Psychotic episodes do not equal schizophrenia.  They can be induced, as you know.   <br>  <br>  Your answer just seems too stridently one-sided to be thorough and balanced.  We ain't all droolin' slackers, ya know.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	1) what would i say to a first timer? hmm, just smoke with someone you trust and have fun.<br>  <br>  2) it is not addictive at all. you may develop a mental dependency after smoking all day everyday for twenty years, but even that can be cured by stopping for a month. the DEA is full of sh*t on that matter.<br>  <br>  3) you will probably not feel anything the first time you do it. so if you plan on just smoking it once, you will be left disappointed. i had to smoke daily for about three weeks before i finally got REALLY high, the highest i've ever been. so do whatever you want, but it won't be much fun the first time.<br>  <br>  4) chronic is very potent weed. strains like white widow, og kush and others are part of the "chronic" family.|`|AA10069553	1. You may not get "high" the first time. It took me 2 or 3 times to get high a giggly but it was well wworth time.<br>  <br>  2. Almost all my friends smoke and none of them are addicted. Say they couldn't get weed, thats cool, but if we can then hell ya. What I mean is that we wouldn't go driving around town looking for any or do anything stupid to get it.<br>  <br>  3. Depends on the person. Super High Me is a great movie to watch. It's a Super Size Me spoof. It shows a pot smoker (Comedian Doug Benson) not get high for 30 days, and then be high 24/7 for 30 days. He takes several diffrent tests with and without it and basically nothing changed to negativly (He scores higher on the test [ACT I think] and is deemed more psychic while high).<br>  <br>  Chronic is better. Yes.|`|ADX5N1etaa	Okay, I'm here to clear up the misconceptions that other users have about marijuana. I am a college student with a 3.8 GPA. I go to a prestigious school with on of the top architecture programs in the country. I am a daily cannabis smoker, yet I have better grades than most of my non-smoker friends. I work hard. I am motivated. I get my work done, study for tests, I don't procrastinate. Yet I am a pot smoker, and as such, I am unfairly labeled as "stupid" or "lazy" or "dumb."<br>  <br>  I don't let my life revolve around marijuana. Marijuana comes second to schoolwork and other priorities.<br>  <br>  As a first timer, I would say take it slow. Marijuana is like alcohol--the more you take, the more it affects you. Start with one hit, and see how that makes you feel. If you feel like taking another hit, do so. Don't worry, marijuana is VERY safe and there has not been ONE death attributed to its use. The high lasts about 1-3 hours, depending on your tolerance, the amount of weed you smoke, the strength of the weed, etc. As a first timer myself, I smoked a 1 gram blunt to myself and was absolutely torched. I was high for about 4 hours. It can be scary at first, because you don't know what being "high" feels like, but as the high progresses I guarantee you will enjoy it. You are euphoric, giggly, and peaceful. I can't even describe the feeling, you will have to experience it for yourself.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, marijuana has been proven time and time again to be SAFER than alcohol and tobacco. It is NOT addictive; at one time I was smoking 2-3 times a day, but one day just stopped for 6 months with NO side effects. I repeat, it is NOT addictive. There is NO "hangover" like alcohol, except maybe feeling a little tired. People start and stop smoking all the time with no ill effects. When I am not smoking, I don't crave it, don't really have the desire to smoke it. You can stop and start at your leisure.<br>  <br>  And NO, smoking it once will have NO harmful long term effects. You will be fine.<br>  <br>  And yes, there is one more thing that you should be aware of: INHALE! INHALE INHALE INHALE. If you don't inhale properly, you won't get high. Practice taking deep breaths, because that is how you properly smoke. Put the joint/bowl/piece up to your mouth, form an airtight seal, and BREATHE DEEP. Do NOT just hold it it your mouth. To make extra sure it goes in your lungs, after you take the piece away from your mouth, take an extra breath of normal air to force to smoke into your lungs. Hold your breath for about 5 seconds (VERY IMPORTANT for the THC to be absorbed) and exhale. You should start feeling the effects anywhere after 30 seconds - 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  Did you know that marijuana has been proven to be safer than alcohol and tobacco? That marijuana has been proven to fight cancer (the THC induced programmable cell death in the cancerous cells, killing them before they spread)? That marijuana has been used for over 3000 years as a medicine, food source, and a psychoactive? That it wasn't until the 1930s that it became illegal in the U.S. (mostly due to an utterly false campaign against it by Harry J. Anslinger, who was quoted as saying "Marihuana influences Negroes to look at white people in the eye, step on white men's shadows and look at a white woman twice")?<br>  <br>  Cannabis is NOT a drug, it is a PLANT. A NATURALLY OCCURRING substance. If you believe in God, then you believe he created everything on Earth, which --gasp-- includes cannabis!<br>  <br>  Learn your facts before you blindly regurgitate the propaganda that is being shoved down your throat. Learn to investigate things for yourself.<br>  <br>  No, it does NOT kill brain cells. It does NOT cause schizophrenia (either you are genetically destined to have schizophrenia or you aren't, marijuana doesn't "bring it out").<br>  <br>  Marijuana is NOT a gateway drug; it will not turn you into a schizo murderer. The worst that will happen is you camped on your couch, pigging out on Taco Bell and watching Seinfeld, giggling the whole time.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|r1Vg6djRaa	"shotta" pretty much summed it up..lmao<br>  just listen to him and your good to go. cause he actually knows what he is talking about unlike some dumbass people who say "omg dont do it youll die"<br>  or " omg you will get addicted and f*ck your life up" bla bla bla<br>  <br>  haha to a first timer..i would say:<br>  1. dont take too many hits or you mught just have a major panick attack..lol<br>  2. bongs and blunts are better<br>  3. if you smoke a blunt, take 3 little hits and breath in btwn them then hold the smoke in rather that one huge hit that will make you cough out ur ***..haha<br>  4. and dont forget the music cause MANN you will love it when ur high<br>  lmao<br>  <br>  &uhm NO its not addictive<br>  & no even smoking it every day will not really have harmfull effects<br>  <br>  ...something else you should be aware of about smoking is sometimes your voice will be funny after and or ull start coughing haha so if your doing it in a place (like school) where you dont want it to be obvious theres a warning for you. <br>  everything else is just the  stuff like you might have to have things repeated lmao or your eyes might get kinda squinty and red. ...and dont get parinoid. if you feel yourself starting to panic just tell yourself to relax, and realize that you are high & feel really good..haha that always works for me.|`|l7atFRIOaa	if youve smoked a cigerette before and know how to do it properly youll be fine, but it can tickle your throat and youll end up coughing if you dont sit up straight. its not addictive, only mentally, and thats only if you smoke it regularly like every day, it wont have harmful long term effects if you smoke it just the once, youll get the munchies depending on how much you smoke and the giggles, i sometimes get a headache the day after but thats all. if you smoke alot you can start "pranging out" which means maybe seeing something and thinking its something else and you get scared or maybe just seeing stuff but thats never happened to me. but really theres nothing to worry about just dont smoke it every day!!! or make it a habit, long term use can lead to schitzophrenia, brain damage, and all kinds of stuff i dont know about.
pvCz6z4uaa	well, it could be her period, or it could be something that happened between you?  can you remember doing anything that may have upset her? or possibly she's going through a hard time with something in her life.  You should call her and ask her what's the matter, it'll show her you care.  <br>  <br>  hopefully it is just her period, so that there's no big problems.  they come usually every 28 days for most women, and last about a week.  Hormones go CRAZY and i know for me, i get wicked emotional and dont wanna talk to many people.  this could be happening to her now, which could be the reason for the mis-communication.  just be there for her and comfort her, because it really really sucks, nvmd being painful and annoying among many other things.  <br>  <br>  but your best bet is to give her a ring and talk to her about whatever's bothering her.  good luck to both of you!|`|6DKMnAJJaa	A girl gets her period once a month.Maybe you should try calling her.Good luck.<3333|`|pexxZB8Daa	it follows a pattern when ur older like since a few years after it starts but it can be irregular|`|5Hb20PZKaa	Its totally different for every girl. <br>  If she's really skinny she probably wont get it till she a slightly older like 14. <br>  Most girls get it around 12/13 yrs. old. The basic pattern once she gets it is once a month. On average its around 28 day btw the first day of one and the first day of the next bt that varies depending on the person, stress level, diet, physical activity, heath...etc<br>  Theres no way to really tell unless u see stained panties in the laundry. Just buy some regular pads and tampons and put them in the bathroom. Then let her tell u, itll be less embarrassing for her.

For my plaque psor.

tGEMwgyBaa	The resorbed root will never grow back and if you keep the tooth <br>   most likely you will always have problems with mobility. I think your best bet is to see an implant specialist and see what he thinks first of the likelihood of how an implant will work in all this. If I had to go threw this I would get rid of the tooth with the resorbed root. Again, I think the future problems with it will be more to deal with in the end. I hope this was helpful.

Since the late 1920s the strain could be found only in pigs; no human being under age fifty could have built up antibodies to it. This meant that what might (or might not) be a virulent human flu virus had acquired a new outer coat of antigenic proteins that might (or might not) make it very contagious to humans.

j2MQJ29caa	1. Begin right where you are. Walk for 20-30 minutes a day, 5 days a week for weeks one and two.<br>  <br>  2. Remove the following from your diet: Late night sugary snacks and all fast food meals.<br>  <br>  3. Add the following to your diet: 12 glasses of water a day and slowly increase your fiber intake to 40+ grams a day.<br>  <br>  4. Increase your protein intake. Eat a portion of protein with every single meal.<br>  <br>  5. Measure your food portions using the fist method. No portion shall be bigger than your fist. If it is, reduce it.<br>  <br>  6. Eat real food. Protein shakes have their place, but whole food is unprocessed and needs your body to perform its digestive and delivery process.<br>  <br>  7. Weeks 3-7 doing a minimum of 30-45 minutes walking 5 days a week.<br>  <br>  8. Increase your meals to four a day. Spread them evenly over the day. No bingeing.<br>  <br>  9. Eat your first meal within 45 minutes after you wake. Be sure to include protein.<br>  <br>  10. By week 4 you should be 10-15 pounds lighter, depending on your water and muscle composition, without having to join a gym.<br>  <br>  11. Week 5 join a gym. Have a trainer demonstrate some basics. Alternate upper and lower body workouts for 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  12. Weeks 9-12 combine upper and lower body workouts into one streamlined workout lasting no longer than 45 minutes.<br>  <br>  13. Gym tip: move quickly through your exercises even if you have to lighten the load. This creates a cardio effect.<br>  <br>  14. Weeks 8-12 walk for 45-60 minutes 5 days a week. In addition to your gym workouts.<br>  <br>  15. When you feel like quitting or eating something you shouldn’t, compare the short-term gain against the long-term pain.

1a1f6b3a9f0969e8e30f27956f086c4eaa	As you said, "it is the person that counts". You say your family is unattractive, watch the way that they interact with one another and how they treat you, doesn't that make them seem more attractive? Beauty is half in your appearance and half in how you carry yourself. If you act confident, you'll probably start to feel confident. Also, you have a fiance who I'm sure finds you quite attractive. Outside beauty is a strange thing, do you really want to waste your life fixating on it? Some people are mean and want to put you down, don't listen to them. Surround yourself with positive people who care about YOU and support you. Do smaller things to help your appearance: get a flattering hairstyle and clothing. Try to "play up" your best features, but don't dwell on it. Some things in life do happen because of appearances, but not everything. It seems like you probably judge other people based mostly on their looks too, do you really want to do that? Why not remind yourself that life is much more valuable then outer appearances?|`|hhFp7jZSaa	I can be very similar to that,and a lot of people are to one extent or another.It could be body dysmorphic disorder,or it could just be self esteem issues.Either way a lot of people are the same.I included some sites.You could have a look to see if you maybe have bdd.Good Luck.|`|AA11681797	sounds like you have had a really tough life,<br>  concentrate on being you<br>  everyone is different and special in thier on way,<br>  looks are not everything,<br>  remember all this actors and actresses wear lots of makeup and have surgry they live in a differnet world.<br>  sumtimes beatiful people are usualy only liked for the way they look and not for who they are inside.<br>  instead of trying to put urself down concentrate on whats important|`|OWaWv02aaa	Instead of looking at your physical self- why don't you try at looking at something you are good at. Or why don't u look at some really ugly people (like those who are mental or sick in their head) and I think you'll really start to appreciate urself a little more. U should stop comparing yourself to others- tht would make anyone upset.|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	In the grand scheme of things, looks mean nothing. Every person you see on a magazine or tv screen has been digitally retouched. You can't hope to live up to the looks of somebody who has had a professional using photoshop to erase all of their imperfections. <br>  <br>  What you can do however, is try to love yourself for who you are. Not everyone is going to end up being gorgeous, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder and one day somebody will look at you and think you're the most beautiful girl in the world, regardless of what you think. <br>  <br>  I would recommend therapy for your self-esteem problems though. You have no reason to be so down on yourself. <br>  <br>  Also: Anyone who could look at a beautiful wedding photo showing a loving couple on the happiest day of their life and say "shame about her face" isn't a person worth giving the time of day.
H9zXLcDvaa	Yes soup diets do work, but just like anything else that involves successful weight loss YOU HAVE TO STICK WITH IT!.<br>  <br>  Depending on what you have in your soup, some soups burn more calories to digest the food than you get from the food itself.<br>  <br>  I used a soup diet years ago to lose weight.  It contained bell peppers, onions, cabbage, tomato and other stuff like that.  It worked fine, but the side effect was not pleasant.  I am talking about constant gas here.  This is why recently when I needed to lose weight I did not resort to a soup diet.<br>  <br>  In short..yes they can work, but you may not have many friends come around for a while depending on what's in the soup.|`|nl599d8laa	i have never herd of that a soup diet before and if you haven't then don't do it god luck on your diet bye|`|Nl3Y50PXaa	Soup diets don't work. dont even listen to what anyone says on this believe me, ive done it before.<br>  what happens with soup diets is...you do lose weight; however, your losing a lot of muscle, water, a bit of fat..which makes u believe u are losing weight.<br>  Now, when you start eating other foods is when u will start gaining weight - you wont gain back the muscle or the water weight though, this time ull just gain back FAT...which makes u even bigger than u started off with. so no point..  ALSO, losing muscle is a big no no - muscle helps you lose weigh. it helps speed up your metabolism so you dont want to do that.<br>  u NEED protein & tgifs bbq chicken wings, are not enough to help you lose weight..they are filled with fats. if u ware serious about losing weight for the summer..you need to change ur eating habits 100%, once uve accomplished ur goal, eat some tgif bbq wings every now & then. <br>  soo in 2 months..working out & eating healthy,  work ur *** off..if u have any more question..let me know & ill help you as much as i can.<br>  <br>  wooo that was long. but good luck!|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	You need to have a body fat percentage between 7 and 14% to see your abs, and that's not going to happen in 2 months. Not only that, if you have that much fat, your stomach skin is most likely stretched out, so when you lose weight you'll have stretched out skin that can only be removed surgically (same thing happened to me; I had to get a tummy tuck)
7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	No smoking, no beer/ale, no booze, no drugs. no junk food, no fast food garbage, no sugary sweet soda's.  Eat a good, healty, balanced diet with lots of boiled or steamed vegetables.  Drink plenty of water, fruit juices & fat free milk.  Snack on RAW fruit & veggies.  Avoid fried food, greasy food & highly seasoned foods.  Meats need to be baked, boiled or broiled - never fried.  Eat in moderation.  Don't go back for seconds.  Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  Flip your mattress over so it will level out & you will get a good nite's rest.  Avoid stress at work & at home.
ibimEpruaa	From a blokes point of view I think people who accuse their partners of infidelity are often doing it themselves...he was probably seeing her back then...Don`t bother calling him, this may sound like a cliche but things will get better 4u and you won`t feel like this 4ever.|`|vq92AME6aa	dont call him cos if you do it will just make things worse and mess with your head. it will be hard but try to stop thinkin about him and try and move on like he has. some questions just never get answered so theres no point wondering why he ended things|`|sPQBluKEaa	i know that this is going to be hard, but just don't call him. keep with your moving on process that you were working with before.
0e46a7720dc8cb4b81e2e64b078bb13faa	This type of retainer can be processed by the ortho lab that is making your retainer.  Just tell your Orthodontist that you want that type of retainer after you get your brackets removed and when you take your impressions for the retainers.  Of course it is up to the Orthodontist if he or she wants you to have this type of retainer.|`|bcc8647434f2debeaef0e3a8f2b04b1baa	your orthodontist shouldn't have a prob making that for you. More than likely that is the type of retainer he was planning on making for you anyway. but just let them know that is your preference and they will discuss it w/ you. :)
YCmvBc05aa	I don't see why you couldn't get the Essix retainer. <br>  <br>  However, you need to make sure if it is gonna be strong enough to hold your teeth into position and will not cause teeth to shift vertically.<br>  <br>  Your Orthodontist will be the person who can give you an expert opinion.  <br>  <br>  The Hawley retainer has a metal wire that brace the teeth and prevent the teeth from shifting.
O5pVkpL2aa	If you were to take the Vitamin Code Women's, the Vitamin Code Antioxidants and the Perfect Food (I assume that's what you meant by veggie supplement), you would be fine.  There is quite a bit of vitamin A when you combine the 3 products, however, it is water soluble vitamin A and won't hurt you.  <br>  <br>  The Vitamin Code products are a great new product, very easy for your body to absorb.  It's also a great product for those who have trouble digesting pills, since they are capsules you can easily open the capsule and take the vitamin as a powder instead.  They are new to the market but are getting rave reviews.

Get you some Mucinez and some Sudafed and take as directed. It is safe to take the two together. My doctor told me to get some and that they work well together. Rub some Vicks on the bottom of your feet before bed. It will help with the cough. Good luck and hope you get feeling better.
SI67vQNuaa	Yes, I have definitely had allergic reactions to band-aid adhesive and it is something that people do get, you usually have some itching with it as well.  Agree with other person that latex may also be a problem.  If it is an allergy then it should get better in the next few days.  However, if the sites get redder, itchier, swollen or anything else, I would call the office and let them know.|`|h03xGw9Qaa	Allergies are weird. You can never be bothered by something and then it'll start bugging you randomly.<br>  <br>  But yes, you may posibly be allergic to bandaides. Dont spaz about it.<br>  Just go to the doctor t and they'll help ya. And you can use other things besides bandaides.<br>  <br>  You are probably allergic to laytex.<br>  They make laytex free bandaides, so you can just use those.<br>  Wish you luck (:|`|LirTrcZraa	I constantly have allergic reactions to bandaids due to my latex allergy. You might be allergic to the adhesive as well.  Get a blood test ASAP to test for the latex b/c there are tons of possible other allergens related to latex, including foods that you need to avoid if that is the cause of your reaction.|`|ZfWe0msGaa	your probly allergic to Laytex. try using laytex free bandaids|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Just keep an eye on it.|`|VL0A5P9raa	it's possible it's an allergy, but most skin allergies I've heard of were itchy and irritating. I could just be because the glue was fresh and adhered to fresh skin cells (an old band-aid has old skin cells on it; they fall off easier because the skin does, too.) Your blood cells under the skin could cause the red and white color. They should go away soon. If they don't, get it checked out.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	I have an allergy to the adhesive on fabric bandaids (not latex). The area where the adhesive was I get a raised red area with small red bumps that is usually itchy and goes away in a few days.
YW6pLkDvaa	i just started using tampons and i had a hard time with it<br>  and i suggest you don't use the wine cork as someone already said...<br>  it took me about 3 boxes to finally get it right and no im 15 and i can do it when ever i need too<br>  start with really small ones that i think they call slender<br>  the mirror does help i kno it sounds gross it sounded gross to me too<br>  but it really does help seeing where it has to go<br>  and as for putting it in the wrong hole, that really cant happen<br>  just make sure your not putting it in straight up and you push it in far enough<br>  cuz that really does matter<br>  women say that if you put it in right you wont even kno you have it in<br>  and its true but it all has to do wit if you put in all the way and you truly cant feel it|`|ODRbsCIKaa	just find your hole, relax and you should be able to get it in. I was 14 when i first used one and it took me like 6 to actually do it so dont thing that you're weird or something cause its taking you a little bit of time|`|B6ioLtejaa	I am not a girl, therefore I have no experience with this subject, but what about lubing that sucker up with some Vaseline. Then that little bad-boy should slip right in there.|`|OqQPzYfHaa	try a wine bottle cork. they are much more effective|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	It took me a LONG time before<br>  I could do it properly.<br>  <br>  Then I finally realized I was using the<br>  wrong kind and doing it all wrong.<br>  <br>  This might seem way too, um, detailed...<br>  but I used to not put the plastic part in and<br>  just push the end.<br>  <br>  And I was also using extra heavy absorbency<br>  tampons and after that I tried cardboard ones.<br>  <br>  And yep, I went through a couple boxes;)<br>  <br>  Now I can finally do it and it's a lot more comfortable<br>  and less gross than pads are.<br>  <br>  I've heard you could do it with a mirror but idk<br>  if I really wanna see all that... I can do without.<br>  <br>  I use Tampax Pearl (the purple box/light) and it<br>  works fine. Make sure it has a plastic applicator.<br>  <br>  You can lie down or put one leg up or just sit.<br>  Relax. Now hold the little 'grip' on the applicator and<br>  push it in your vagina. Yup, the whole thing. Then push<br>  the little stick on the end. Pull out the applicator. The<br>  string should hang. <br>  <br>  Now get up and put all your weight in one hip.<br>  Does it hurt? Jump. Did it fall out?<br>  <br>  If you can barely feel it you're fine.|`|gKKD8Aayaa	Firstly find a bathroom and get out your tampon and sit on the toilet. Some people find it easier to insert a tampon if their legs are also bent and the toilet seat. Another way to do it is don't sit on the toilet and put one leg up on the seat. (Also i suggest using tampons with a plastic applicator)<br>  Step2<br>  Now that you are ready to put in your tampon open the wrapper and pull out the tampon. Try not to touch it to much causing germs from your hands to get on it. Now look at your tampon; there is a string at the bottom, then a small tube that you can push into the larger tube above it.<br>  Step3<br>  Okay so now that the tampon is out and you are ready to go with the hand opposite of the one you write with make a peace sign with your index and middle fingers. Separate the inner lips with these fingers.<br>  Step4<br>  With your other hand kind of poke around with your pointer finger and try to find the correct hole. It is the one after where your urine comes from but is before the buttocks. Once you know you have the correct hole get the tampon in your hand that is not separating.<br>  Step5<br>  Now you must be relaxed for the next step. So take deep breaths and try singing in your head if you are nervous. It will not hurt at all but it is easier to get in if your muscles are relaxed.<br>  Step6<br>  Now hold the end of the largest part of the tampon with you index finger and thumb. Now find the hole that you found in step four again. Once you have found it push in the plastic top of the tampon until your index finger and thumb are touching your va****.<br>  Step7<br>  Now using your middle finger press in the small plastic part that is still outside of you until it is completely inside of the other plastic part.<br>  Step8<br>  Using your index finger in thumb remove the plastic applicator and dispose. And you are finished!|`|HzCBOwlyaa	wow you know there are directions on the box? and I feel sorry for you if your sticking it in another hole...like are you sticking it in your ear? because theres only 3 holes down there ...lets see a** hole (exit) p***y hole ( thats where it goes ) and the pis* hole ( which if you fit something in there im going to cry for you ) <br>  <br>  for me 1 tampon 1 time and i was 13! it should come natural|`|X3QbcIUwaa	It's so confusing isn't it?<br>  <br>  What I found helpful, was to insert it after a shower, as it slides easier.<br>  <br>  You literally just push it as far as your finger goes leaving the little string out.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about wasting packs, I did that a lot too.<br>  <br>  Still, I find pads easier.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4wINNSSeaa	get a mirror and place it on the floor<br>  place you leg on the bath or toilet<br>  you can then see what your doing|`|GEfpzUNvaa	there is only one hole there that will fit a tampon.. look and read at the instructions.. try sitting on the toilet that helps you find it better... good luck
76iuxeLWaa	I, too, am a MMA fighter. I understand the push for getting the edge. Ive never taken steroids but I have had many friends that do. They are really dangerous for you as well as him. The best thing you can do is get out of the situation. After youre out, you need to tell him hes going to have to quit if he really cares about you. It wont be easy because steroids are mind altering but if he does care he will quit. Ive had one friend die from them and one destroyed his body and now is almost totally disabled. Its just one of those things that theres not a easy anwser to. It will only change if he really cares and about you, not to mention himself. He is going to have to want the change.|`|c87ej8qRaa	You have to ask yourself how important this is to you. Is it worth losing him?

X5SvEWZZaa	I personally think your friend is going through depression. I feel the same way. I am not afraid of death. Also when you go through depression you feel tired and its hard for you to get through the day. Maybe your friend is self-injuring themselves,like cutting perhaps. i cut and many of the people that i know that feel the same way cut too. I would let her know that you are always there for them because then they would be more willing to tell you what's going on.
BCluX5xVaa	The above answers all could be correct, but it also could be depression.These are symptoms.

ToILKl6waa	Use the sensitivity to your advantage. Find joy in writing or drawing and getting in touch with more people. Get your creative juices flowing through new interests. Do things you don't normally do and wear things you don't normally wear. Do not ever limit yourself in a limitless world and remember you are always in control. No depression can take that from you. Also, make sure you get an adequate amount of sleep and nutrition with no high sugars and caffeine. Set aside time each day to go running for a while. It releases anxiety and it can really make you feel better. Do not spend your time at home thinking about the grief. Learn to let things go and strive for new experiences in the future. Grudges will do nothing for you.|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	I've heard that taking at least 1,000mg of Fish Oil or Flaxseed Oil has helped people with moderate depression, and exercise can help as well because of the adrenaline rush.

When I am sad or angry meditation really helps. Turn the lights low, light some incense, and search meditation sounds on youtube. Just sit cross legged on the floor and breathe with your eyes closed and try to zone out.  It is great for clearing your mind and making you feel better.  Also, always remember there are people out there doing a lot worse than you.  As long as there is mass genocide in Sudan and people starving around the world, your life cannot be that bad.|`|RAPeNncwaa	good job, you don't need pills. I think you need to be loved.

It is also called aerobic endurance or<br>  aerobic fitness, it is the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to adjust to and<br>  recover from the effects of moderate to vigorous activity, such as running, swimming, or biking.<br>  Improving aerobic endurance increases the ability of the heart, lungs, and muscles to do work<br>  over a longer period of time. Together, good nutrition and physical activity will promote life long<br>  health benefits and disease prevention.<br>  <br>  Exercises to improve include:  running, walking, biking, swimming, aerobics, stationary bike, and any other activities to raise your heart rate to your target heart rate.

Just pull it through the gap.<br>  <br>  The knot will push the food particles out.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure the bite (occlusion) on the temporary and the final (permanent) crown is okay. If it is high/ bulky, then your tooth will get hit by the opposing teeth and will cause pain.

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You don't say how tall you are, pet. This is important. <br>  <br>  All you need do at your age is learn about food, and about what's good for you. Learn to like those vegetables, they are your friend and are good for you. Don't eat junk food more than you have to (there's a reason it's called 'junk' food) and learn to eat fatty things like cakes and biscuits and cream and cheese in moderation. In other words, you can have a little of everything, but don't have dessert every day, make it into a treat. Eat 5 or 6 small meals a day, make sure they are healthy, and have about 250-300g of carbs every day. Jamie Oliver had this thing about school dinners, and he was absolutely right. Get one of his cookbooks, he has some great recipes. <br>  <br>  Toning up makes you lose bulk, not necessarily weight. Muscles way more than fat - but this is okay for the average person. Toned muscles look nice and are not bulky, and the more your muscles are toned, the more fat they burn. For you, I think sports that you enjoy might be good, but you might like to explore pilates or yoga too.
nAp688tZaa	Lidocaine requires a prescription from your doctor.  There are Lidocaine patches that you can get which are applied directly to the area that is in pain.  They help with numbing the area and can be used 12 hours continuously in a 24 hour period. They come in boxes with 30 patches and can be a little pricey.  Each time I have mine filled it costs $25, which is the preferred brand name co-pay on my insurance.  Without the insurance, they can cost a few hundred dollars for a 30 day supply.

nAp688tZaa	The worst part of the physical withdrawal symptoms should be over in about 3-4 days, but it will more than likely take you a couple of weeks to feel completely better.  During this time of withdrawal, you need to monitor a couple of things.  First, check your blood pressure a few times per day since hypertension is a serious side effect of opiate withdrawals. You want to make sure it does not exceed 130/80.  Also, take your heart rate each time you do the blood pressure.  You want your heart rate to be no higher than 130 beats per minute.  If either of these gets too high, you should see your doctor or go to an Urgent Care. They can prescribe blood pressure medication to keep yours down.  The BP medication is also helpful in keeping the heart rate lower.  You do not want to trade the addiction to opiates for an addiction to something in the benzodiazapine drug category, so stay away from anxiety medications like Xanax and Valium if at all possible.  If you are a couple of days into the withdrawal, the worst will be over soon.  Just make sure you keep drinking lots of fluids (no caffeine) and try to eat as healthy as you can.  If you find that you are not hungry, which is common, you need to take a good multi-vitamin for the next couple of weeks.  Try to get some exercise to wear yourself out and this should help you sleep a little better. <br>  <br>  Hopefully, this withdrawal process will be a good reminder to you the next time that you are faced with the decision to start using again.  Just remember how much this sucked, how much pain and agony you went through, how sleep deprived you are feeling right now, and how you would not want to do it again.  It's not like withdrawals get better each time you go through it. In fact, they can be worse. If the thought of going through this again is not enough to keep you away from the pills, here is one more thing to consider.  Illegal possession of a controlled substance is a felony and can carry 3-5 years in prison for each count on which you are found guilty.  Judges and law enforcement are not being lenient with these sentences any more either since there is such a big problem with the diversion and illegal use of prescription narcotics.   If you need help to stay clean, see a psychologist or psychiatrist with a background in substance abuse.  They will help you work through the addiction and help you develop ways to avoid situations where you would be tempted to use again.|`|QBFANhXaaa	Drink lots of water and tea, particularly Chamomile and Peppermint tea. Don't drink caffeine. Drinking water and tea will help flush out your system, and Chamomile and peppermint have relaxation properties. You could also try progressive relaxation or meditation.

5UaVp256aa	<a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting. The site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking, and it's free.<br>  <br>  "It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you."|`|bY58V3oraa	Have you heard of the new electronic cigarettes?  There was a story about them on Yahoo about a week ago.  I've been smoking for 30 years and have tried everything to quit smoking without any success.  And I bought two packs of cigarettes today that cost me more than $12.  That’s just crazy!  So I will be ordering my electronic cigarette starter package this week and I'm very excited about it.  They simulate a real cigarette which none of the other quit smoking aids have done.  They come with a rechargeable battery, when you inhale, you get a burst of nicotine for that craving and it actually looks like you're blowing out smoke but it's a water vapor mist.  The tip of the cigarette even illuminates.  So you get the nicotine you crave, the hand and mouth fixation is covered and exhaling the vapor mist looks like smoke.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of it is you still get all the stuff you crave from smoking without all the negative side effects or harmful additives found in tobacco.  The starter kit comes with the electronic cigarette, battery, and five nicotine cartridges.  Each cartridge is supposed to be equal to 1-2 packs of cigarettes.  The kit is $79 and the cartridge refills are around $13 for a pack of five.  I will be ordering from the site below.|`|4YxuxEIOaa	Give yourself two days, the craving are out of your system<br>  <br>  Start chewing gum. At every opertunity.

Smoking sucks... This from a woman who's quit 3 times. And each time with no drugs, gum or stuff. My quitting was also successful until I would say to myself...I'll just have one cigarette. Impossible!   Each time I quit I selected a time period (long weekend) where I had no stress.  Ten days to two weeks before I would eliminate anything I associated with smoking. Coffee, Wine, soda. The last time I just got mad because it was soooo expensive. And think positive, keep busy for the weekend. Exercise, do some activity you really enjoy.  And think about all the money your going to save and what you can do with that money. I've also tapered off, less and less everyday and the last time and the most successful I smoked every darn cigarette before I quit.<br>  <br>  Good luck and you will be so much happier and smell better. You'll be suprised after a few weeks free from cigarrettes, you pick up a sweater or coat and it will STINK. The fresh smoke will still smell good, so avoid being around people that smoke. Oh and one more thing, don't substitute food for smoking. Sugarless gum, carrots, but keep away from anything else.<br>  <br>  Best...|`|7ab916140739d43fdaf1975e036f6b98aa	Cold turkey has an average success rate of about 9%.

JYwvwDbKaa	I suggest you use some shaving foam if you still want to look good after shaving!<br>  The hairs getting darker is normal!|`|qicRLHMLaa	Dry shaving is bad for your face I use the brush and cake soap made for shaving.|`|SltEwVX7aa	no.  it means your beard is coming in thicker.  and not because you're shaving it;  you're just getting older and it's developing, like everything else in puberty.<br>  <br>  you just about don't need either product when you begin to shave;  the hair is pretty fine and thin.  shaving cream is simply to soften the hair.  you can accomplish the same thing in the shower using warm water and washing your face;  the soap and water will soften is well enough.  I still have never figured out after shave.  Most of it has alcohol in it, and why would you want to put alcohol on fresh cuts?  No thanks.  It's a marketing hype.  Just shave, and rinse your face with warm water.  If you're gonna put anything on, put on some moisturizer.<br>  <br>  I'd say it's time you started using some shaving cream.  Edge makes a great gel, and if you just want cheap, effective shaving cream, then Barbasol is the brand.  Always wash your face with warm water before applying the shaving cream.  And you really don't need a whole lot;  enough to cover the beard.  Any more is just wasting it.|`|6evKakpsaa	YESSS, not using shaving cream would in the long term cause damage to the skin.

AA10815212	It depends.  If you have significant other cardiac risk factors (smoker, diabetes, high blood pressure, immediate family members with hx of heart attack) then you probably do need medication.  Most people with strict measures in life style changes can achieve between 10-15% reduction in their LDL.  If you achieved that and have no other risk factors then medication is probably unnecessary.  Niacin and fish oils are probably your best non-statin options if you choose medications.  That said, there is strong evidence to support the use of statins in particular with better cardiovascular event reduction compared to lowering cholesterol similarly without statins.  As far as side effects are concerned - some people are intolerant of statins, even in low dose.  Most people do fine, however.  Side effects are usually not an issue until you reach at least half of the maximum recommended dosage.  (with Lipitor 80mg is max).<br>  <br>  Here are the recommendations:<br>  LDL 130 or less.  No risk factors<br>  LDL 100 or less.  Cardiac risk factors but no history of heart disease.<br>  LDL 70 or less.  Known heart disease or previous cardiac event. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	A bit on the high side. I would try atorvastatin 10 mg daily, and check the levels again after 3 months.

SiomJ10Saa	If she picks it off .. it won't technically cause more problems .. and it is really really tempting to do<br>  <br>  but honestly I would say just leave it, cause when you peel it off it has to restart the healing process so it will take more time to heal in the long run, and probably leave a scar for a while too..<br>  <br>  Try using lysine .. they make a topical one for like $8 at walgreens .. it works dec, but you have to use it a lot through the day..<br>  <br>  if staying home for the night, take the makeup off of it, then keep the tube in your pocket and just keep reapplying it all night, and then put a thick amount of it on before bed as well<br>  <br>  also take l-lysine .. it's a vitamin you can buy at grocery stores, walmart, etc.<br>  <br>  if you take like 4 a day starting when you first get that "tingle" feeling, it usually makes it never end up coming .. or healing in just like 2 days instead of a couple weeks|`|mP6ox5f3aa	Cold sores are a pest and I am prone to them.

The thing is..your friend has a form of herpes that will come back possibly. Cold sores come back when they want and the sooner she learns to handle them, the better. First of all, she will need to buy Abreva; its FDA approved and is known to work really well. The cold sore itself will take at least a week before it is all the way gone. For the time being, she should wash it with antibacterial soap once every 1-2 hours. She should apply the cold sore treatment as it suggests and stay away from extreme heat and avoid being in situations which will make her stressed (aside from the cold sore). She should also have friends that understand that she is not amongst the dead; its a condition which a lot of people have sooner or later.

You are eating all wrong.  First figure out your basal metabolic rate to see how many calories you burn daily while at rest.  Drop that by a few hundred, and spread it out among at least 6 small meals a day. 1000 calories will keep your body in starvation mode, keep your metabolism low, causing your body to try to store as much food as you eat.  The object is to raise your metabolism and never letting it fall by eating small meals constantly.   Avoid foods packed with carbs like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, anything with sugar in it, etc.    <br>  <br>  Or go a step further for even better results and try to eat as few carbs (under 50g/day) as possible.  Make vegetable the most carb packed food you eat (1-2g carbs per serving).  In comparison a piece of bread is 20g carbs per slice.  Look up ketogenic diet.  You will substitute fats and proteins while cutting carbs out of the diet.  Then you wont even be thinking about nasty cookies because youll be able to indulge in meats, fish, poultry, cheese, nuts....and watching the fat melt off because your body is now gonna be using fat and protein for energy instead of carbs.<br>  <br>  Lift weights 4-5 times a week, do cardio every day.  Most importantly...research.  The problem is most people dont have a clue about nutrition, what foods have what effect on the body, how to eat and when to eat, and these are the most important pieces of the puzzle.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Don't forget that muscle is much heavier than fat.

Or a trusted teacher? or other trusted adult? <br>  Your feeling are valid and you need to be heard.

Regardless of the obvious hormonal imbalance at your age, it's not right that you feel this low. But, do rest assured, it is normal. Plenty of us feel low in our teens and some people need a little bit of help adjusting. Seeking help for yourself is a great way for you to grow into a well-rounded adult. <br>  <br>  You don't need to think about death or feel suicidal to be depressed, but you clearly have a feeling of being low and that your life isn't quite as you'd like it to be. Your life will only get better when you take control of it and you can do this by finding someone to talk this through with. Maybe your school has a Professional on site that you can speak to? If not, go to your GP  and they should be able to point you in the right direction and give you some support in the meantime. Speak to your parents about this, too. I know it'll be hard but this will be far easier to deal with once you have a firm support network around you.<br>  <br>  It's important that you do understand how normal this is. It doesn't need to be a big deal, but it does need to be dealt with.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SNr7R0Z0aa	Depressed people thinking about death is just a stereotype.

Is there a history of depression in your family? You're more likely to have depression symptoms if your mother or father, or other close relatives do too. <br>  <br>  However, the fact that you're not getting a lot of sleep could have a lot to do with things. Insomnia can cause depression-like symptoms. <br>  <br>  If there's really nobody you can talk to (not your parents?) then you should see if your school has a psychiatrist or a counselor and talk to them. <br>  <br>  It's possible you're depressed, but it's equally as likely that you're just going through normal teenage girl emotions. If you don't want to talk to anyone right away, wait and see if things get better after a month or two, but if not, you need to see somebody professional. Good luck.

It stores bile produced in the liver and is used to break down fat.  The gall bladder simply stores and concentrates the bile.<br>  <br>  The gall bladder does not directly lead into the stomach either.  Fat breakdown occurs (along with most digestion) in the small intestines.  Mild gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining that could be caused by a number of factors: hyper-acidity, allergy, infection, food intolerance, stress..<br>  <br>  They may want to do an ultrasound to look at whether or not you may have gall stones that could be blocking the bile duct.  Not to worry.  If you had gall bladder problems, your symptoms would not sound like yours.

x9RDPwIZaa	Eating healthy at Walt Disney is not difficult.  One of the cheapest snacks in the parks is fruit and it is easy to find.  Disney has goen health conscience and offers lighter offerings (grilled chicken, salads, etc) every place they sell food.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, table service restaurants, just like any restaurant, will fix special order items.  Avoid buffets if you find it too tempting, but know the plates are small and if you stick to one trip to the buffet line you will control your portion size well.<br>  <br>  Don't skip meals.  Skipping meals does your body no good.  But, you may snack more instead of eating a meal.  As I'm sure you know, many smaller meals are better than three larger meals.  Portion sizes are large at Disney, so snacks can qualify better and help you keep portion sizes down.  You may also bring your own food/snacks into the parks.  <br>  <br>  Stick to water. Bring flavor packages (like crystal light) with you if you need flavor.<br>  <br>  You do a lot of walking every day.  Miles worth.  Eat your bigger meals earlier and keep getting lighter/smaller as the day wears on.  You're more likely to burn those calories.<br>  <br>  Don't deny yourself.  Everyone needs a Mickey bar.  Just keep it to no more than one a day (or every other day) have it early in the day.<br>  <br>  Also, try not to clean your plate.  If you can leave a little behind, you'll thank yourself.  Also, skip the guacamole, ketchup, mayo, and sour cream on items. <br>  <br>  Really, it's no different than eating healthy at home.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	If you have a kitchen at the place you are staying, that would be a big help.  You could avoid eating at restaurants for every meal and overindulging.  <br>  <br>  If not, buy some apples, bananas and maybe some bagels or breakfast bars.  Eat those for breakfast instead of going out.  Each day, choose one meal to be the 'big meal' of the day.  For the other one, just grab a sandwich and a side- an apple or coleslaw or baked chips.  Then for the other meal, you can splurge a little more.  But it's still a good idea to split an entree with someone since restaurant portions are often huge, or take half of it back with you and eat it later.  <br>  <br>  Even though you're on vacation, try to maintain a schedule and eat 3 meals a day.  Varying your schedule can lead to eating at odd times, skipping meals, etc...  Bring a health bar with you when you go out for the day in case of a hunger attack.  <br>  <br>  And don't be too hard on yourself... have a little dessert- you're on vacation!!  Have fun:)|`|teL6RS9Jaa	It is very easy to eat more healthy menu items at Walt Disney World Restaurants.  Every sit down and counter service restaurants have salads or vegetarian type dishes to help you stay on track.  If you have any specific requests, you can always ask your server.  Most restaurants will make entree items to order, if you have any specific requests.  If you need help with restaurant selection, we always contact MouseDine.  They are specialized in booking Disney restaurants.<br>  <br>  You should bring your own snacks to munch on during the day.  None of the snack locations are really healthy.  There are a few spots that have fresh fruit or veggies, but pack your own healthy snacks.  You can pack them in a backpack to carry at the parks.  <br>  <br>  Stay focused and continue being strong, even during your vacation.  You can do it!|`|4A7uVacFaa	Go to allears.net and go to the menu section. As mentioned, healthy food is available, but it will help to know where to look for it.

I often order one portion for my wife and I and cut it in half and share. A half portion is enough to make me feel full, but leaves room for dinner and a snack at the same time.
IaX9xTcIaa	yes you will get a period but for most pills it will be shorter and not as heavy. mine usually starts around wed. and ends sat or sun
QsbB6vkoaa	sometimes, after you just went through labor, your hormones are really not how they are supposed to be. some women after giving birth have a very light period, some have a very heavy period but doesn't last long, and some have it light in the beginning, but after a few weeks it becomes very intense.<br>  i don't think it's a reason for you to freak out, but it is a reason for you to see your doctor. they might put you on the pill, so your hormones will go back to normal.<br>  although this isn't so abnormal, you should make an appointment as soon as possible, so your doctor can tell you if it's something that you should be worried about. and of course so you can feel better.<br>  good luck|`|AA11498678	It seems to be a hormonal imbalance or the effects of breast feeding.

AGlpdpAKaa	hypoglycemic is the opposite of diabetes.  diabetes is when your blood sugar is too high.  hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar is too low.  i'm hypoglycemic, adn it sucks! i get shaky, headache, hungry, sometimes i feel like i'm going to pass out.  sometimes it gets really bad and i get extremely fatigued, so much that i can't stand up.  she should keep raw almonds, nuts and seeds, dried fruit etc. in her purse at all times, and make sure she snacks before she even feels hungry.  it will help a lot.  also, make sure NOT to eat sugar.  EVER.  the less sugar she eats, the more stable her blood sugar will be.  when i eat sweets, my blood sugar goes up and down all day really badly.  when she's feeling hypoglycemic, she should have fruit or protein.  never a chocolate bar or cookie or anything like that.  it will fix her for an hour, then she'll crash again, but even worse!|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Definitely hypoglycemic. 40, and 52 are way too low of  a CBG. She needs some education on symptomology and how to deal with it. She shouldn't skip meals and should always have some quick form of glucose handy such as fruit juices, nuts or whole grain crackers.  In the short term, low blood sugar is much more dangerous than high blood sugar.|`|CUERZHgxaa	why do you ask these question tell her (you) go to the doctor or buy a glucose meter for 20 bucks
afz2ZPJPaa	I think I'd ask her when she found out and when she is due to start treatments.  Then I would *offer* to help her with her school work (bringing it to the hospital) and going over the assignments.  If she really does have a tumor, the best thing you could do to help her is to be specific when you offer something.  Never say: Give me a call if you need something.  They won't call.  <br>  <br>  If she does have a tumor, and isn't doing it for the attention, by stepping up and offering to help her and believe her, you could make the friend of a lifetime.  And if she's lying, think about what she must be going through to make up something like that.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|iBkSJPmxaa	In hypnosis the teach me that you can use imagination to overcome anything. You can help her making her to visualize or imagine that she is OK. You can make her a history about someone that had some name similar like her, for example is her name is Maria the history had to had a name that start with M, no the same name. The other thing if you know the setting of her family structure use the same family in order for her to relate to the story. Make sure that in the end is good outcoming, that will help her out. Another thing make her imaging all good qualities in order for her to get it.<br>  The brain is very powerful make sure that everything that you use is positive, never in the imaginary thing use her probem or the asume problem.<br>  Good luck if you have any questions feel free to email me.<br>  Thnaks|`|kPKKyZluaa	If she does not have many friends than she could be saying that for attention.

Be nice, but unless she brings it up, don't talk about it.|`|JITTMjasaa	There is nothing you can do but be nice. Don't be fake though. Bad things do happen to people in high school too. I remember in high school I used to get the crap beat out of me by my dad. I did tell a few people. One day I heard some b***hes talking saying, "That's the girl that supposedly gets beat by her dad, she never comes to school with bruises though." It hurt so bad to hear that people actually thought I was lying about that and that people didn't care, I tried to kill myself that night. Don't make her feel like I did and if you hear people talking s**t, stand up for her. Just because she doesn't respond doesn't mean she didn't hear and wasn't hurt.|`|OqQPzYfHaa	tell her to see a doctor or at least the nurse.|`|orGvWwhBaa	Tell her to go to the Doctors / Hospital and get scanned.

qrGLcTh4aa	You have to see a dentist. Check out the local dental schools in your area. They will do the work for free. Or go to a free clinic. You could also set up a payment plan with a dental office to get this work done. Whatever the problem is will not get better without medical attention; furthermore, if you have an infection(which you may) that will effect your overall health. Go to the dentist some how.|`|dccc745590e48c4c843c50f9f041aa18aa	Man; you got to see a Dentist. Ask your school nurse or social worker for the name of a Dentist who may do charity work or you could offer to mow  his lawn or do other work to help you. Get moving; you might lose this tooth and probably have other that can be filled.|`|ekGfpzzuaa	I would not recommend putting glue in your mouth.  When I did not have medical insurance, I went to the drugstore and purchased a over the counter temporary filing system.  It was very cheap (around 6 or 7 bucks) and it worked until I was able to get to the dentist.
689RlsrCaa	I use Desert Essence Face Wash with tea tree oil. I buy a 32oz for 12$ plus tax and it lasts for about six months. I really love this soap and I rarely get acne when I use in in conjunction with a good moisturizer and bp cream.

xxUbFVeFaa	Pneumonia is inflammation and fluid or foreign matter in the lungs, such as fluid, or food that was aspirated. The antibiotics should have killed any bacteria in your lungs, but it can take a while for your breathing to return to normal. The soreness in your armpits is probably a swollen lymph node. The lymph system helps to remove infectious matter from your body. The swollen lymph nodes are probably just residual from the infection, but your doctor can tell you more when you seem them on Wed. It is probably nothing to worry about. Although smoking marijuana may help you to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with being sick, the smoke inhaled will hinder your recovery process. I know that marijuana isn't as hard on the lungs as cigarettes, but that is only because it isn't consumed in the same volume as tobacco. I hope this answers your question.|`|HKLun86Naa	Chances are you have swollen lymph nodes in your armpit, which is why its sore. And pneumonia takes some time to get over. Stay on your antibiotics. If you're improving, then thats a good sign.
AA10563860	Definitely ask him ahead of time.  For example you can talk dirty while he is "eating", and ask him if hed eat your bloody "#@%#^%#@" if you were raggin'.<br>  <br>  You'd definitely have to work that one into your sex talk to not shock him...but thats the safest way.  If he gets all limp after you ask, you can just tell him you were trying to talk dirty and got carried away. :)|`|4wINNSSeaa	play with toys<br>  to dirty<br>  maybe sex, shower after, or have sex while in the bath<br>  the bath will stopo blood flowin out|`|w4kdTalPaa	Ask him he may want to earn his red wings.|`|535f5819c87d00d089b6c44ff34ddec5aa	yuk|`|4jiEViPFaa	i know how you feel, my drive is increased when i'm menstruating as well. i doubt he'd want to perform oral sex, because honestly, who would? but you could ask him if he'd be interested in sex while you're on your period. some guys don't mind it at all, as long as you're wearing protection. be sure to lay down a towel underneath you though, if you care about your sheets.<br>  <br>  another idea is having sex in the bath. the water will stop your bleeding and it'll be a lot less messy.<br>  <br>  just be straight with your guy. try saying:<br>  "i'm really horny, but i'm on my period *sigh*"<br>  hahahha, he'll catch on.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped a bit!|`|MPVNIqeqaa	Gross, what boy would want to lick up blood?<br>  As for sex, he could be okay with it.

nAp688tZaa	There has always been immediate release oxycodone in capsule form.  They are not made in any strength other than 5 or 10 mg's and most do still contain acetaminophen, which is added to keep people from taking too many.  If your "friend" does not know what the strength of the medication is, then it is not prescribed for them and they should not take it.
wOecmtrzaa	Nitrous affects differnet people in slightly different ways.  Some people do float, some people get talkative and some get quiet.  Most people really don't care what's going on unless you are trying to think about it.<br>  <br>  If you are nervous for being in control, you could get nitrous or not, but the main thing you want to do is be very involved in your treatment.  Have your DDS talk you through what he is doing, if you don't think that would scare you.  <br>  <br>  THE BEST thing you can do to ease anxiety is to talk to your dental assistant.  She will be in the room with you the entire time you are on nitrous, and she can calm you down so so much.  <br>  <br>  I have had so many dental treatments of different kinds, and used nitrous and didn't use it.  Personally, I don't usually use nitrous that much, just because it costs an extra 50 bucks out of pocket at my dentist.  I used to be really afraid of going, but after I met my current dentist and dropped my pediatric one I now LOVE going!  This is really because of my relationship with my dental assistant, not drugs or nitrous.<br>  <br>  When you have a cavity filled, you should feel no pain at all.  Your gums will be numbed by a topical anesthetic before you are injected with the local.  Your DDS will wait till thats set in, and then get to work.  If you are ever in any pain during the drilling, you should raise your hand and your DDS should top up your local.<br>  <br>  Really, if it were my first time with nitrous I would just ask my dental assistant what she thought.  It really depends on how you're going to react and what type of work will be done.<br>  <br>  Also, if your cavity is small enough you may be able to get air abrasion.  This is like sandblasting your cavity.  Messy, but totally painless.  It only works on small surface cavities, though.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, it doesn't make you laugh at all.  I find things slightly more amusing on it, but have no will to actually bother laughing.  Sounds funny, I know, but you would have to experience it to know what I'm talking about exactly.<br>  <br>  I know you can have a great treatment if you talk to your assistant!  Good luck!|`|9f81a7341f8ed89dc9c6d39f49022e82aa	I am a fellow control freak as well and I don't use that stuff.  I had two extractions done and I didn't ask for it even though my insurance will cover it. I think it is up to you but one cavity is no big deal.  I think you will be fine without it.  It will be over before you know it.
fHZZeDBPaa	Ok, I wear contact lenses too, and they are also the ones that expire in a month. I'm going to be honest, if you are very careful and hygienic with your lenses you will have no problem. Sometimes I wear the same pair for about three months, the only problem is that with time they will get dry quicker and sometimes they may bother you. However it depends on the brand that you are using. I use Acuvue Oasis and they are great. I always replace them when they start bothering me, even when they are clean (I mean when I know they are clean but they still feel uncomfortable). When you feel that they are starting to bother you, it will be time to replace them. <br>  <br>  So don't worry, I think that you will be fine. As long as you don't keep them for too long (more than a month extra), or you don't keep them when they are bothering you. It's ok.|`|A6GRX4wAaa	You will be fine, just keep caring for them, taking them out every night and cleaning them thoroughly. There is people out there that leave monthly contacts in their eyes for a couple of months and even sleep with them in!

sQu3LLqtaa	To boost your immune system you need extra vitamin C that you can get from more fruit and vegetables.  Oranges and tomatoes contain plenty of vitamin C.<br>  <br>  You could also take a vitamin C supplement once or twice a day.<br>  <br>  You can find further information in a web search for "vitamin c rich foods".|`|K2dNndE2aa	-drink a lot of liquids<br>  -take a multivitamin...i take that once a day teen advantage one.<br>  -use germ x after touching water fountains and doorknobs, but don't overuse it, it can weaken your immune system if you use a lot.<br>  -take those airborne stuff, put it in a drink or get the vitamin or whatever<br>  -get 7-8 hours of sleep|`|BCluX5xVaa	Some of the info above is good, some is well, not so good.

Main thing that gets people sick. stay away from people that cough and sneeze. don't rub your eyes or put your pencil in your mouth. Don't put your fingers in your nose. <br>  Drink Sprite. It helps. :)Exercise more often, it keeps your immune system strong and healthy.|`|tqFdbFPNaa	Drink plenty of liquids and rest as much as you can, also take medicine. Take vitamins also that way you dont get sick.. drink lots and lots of orange juice.
HXpR2bw0aa	Congratulations on your engagement, and I hope your wedding goes well!   :)<br>  <br>  You have plenty of time from now and then!<br>  <br>  For toning, just spend 15-20 minutes every night doing sit ups, push ups, and crunches. The best thing to do is start with 10 minutes for a few days, and then add a minute each day. And it's best to do these exercises at night, just before bed!<br>  <br>  Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)

PyNtY2Ataa	Well you know what the GP is gonna ask you...|`|J4hOL3oLaa	could all be from sciatica. Get a few tennis balls and put them in a tube sock. Lay on the floor with the balls under your back and roll around. It will loosen the muscles. You can do the same by sitting on a tennis ball for the buttock area.|`|7uSSJPMKaa	Yes, it is probably the sciatica.  Normally when sciatica is diagnosed, the DR will do an exam of your rectum to see if the nerves are affected there.  Piles can cause bleeding from the rectum and pain when pasing stool.

I wouldn't worry about it, see if it comes back tomorrow. <br>  If it doesn't reappear and you haven't had any significant changes in your diet,lifestyle or stress levels then keep a record of when it does come and if it hasn't evened out in a few months then go to your doctor and tell them you are having irregular periods.|`|HMsjw3kQaa	If it's always on time and regular 4-5 days long. I would speak to an obgyn (womens doctor). If you are sexually active a baby could be a possibility even though you are on the pill, It can happen but not extremely likely that you are pregnant. Honestly I cannot answer this you need to speak with an obgyn to further investigate this to make sure whats wrong if anything.

I'm asking because it seems like you were cruising along with a good job and a good relationship; now everything is on the verge of falling apart.  Before we go any further, I would like you to seriously think about something:  Suicide is permanent.  You can't get to the other side, decide you don't like it and come back.  Once it's done, it's done.  Also, what about the life after you die?  I don't know if you are religious or not, but what if it is worse over there than it is over here?  And what if it is not your time to go?  I've helped take care of people who tried to kill themselves but failed.  Not pretty.  Okay, on to more constructive stuff.  Here's a couple of suggestions:  Start keeping a journal.  Every day write three good things about the day.  These can be any thing as long as it's positive.  Three of them every day, no matter how crappy you feel.  Make yourself follow a possitive dailey ruetine (get out of bed, get showered, get dressed, eat healthy and go to work).  Do a good job.  Exercise every day enough to work up a sweat, and get out side.  Take a walk or a run.  It would be great if your pardner would go with you, maybe you could start to reconnect.  He needs to be patient with you; you are sick, the same as if you had the flu or cancer or whatever and while medication can help it isn't a quick fix, and it doesn't work for every body.  Try to find a counselor who will not require you to take medication.  Most of all, don't give up.  When you are having thoughts of killing yourself, remember that it is the sickness talking, not you.  Please feel free to write if you want to talk or if I can help.  Good luck and God speed.|`|rIlpqCzmaa	zoloft took 3 weeks to work for me.
LV75kgwraa	So you've told your teacher you connot see the board and he/she won't move you to the front of the class?? <br>  <br>  Sounds like you're getting some eye strain which will cause headaches. You probably should have an eye exam from what you're explaining. I.E. Can't see the board at school, headaches, double vision, etc... However, the double vision can be from tiredness as well. The muscles in the eye can get over-worked and tired. YES, have an eye exam! As far as contacts, it depends on what the doctor refracts you for, and it will depend on what your parent's and the eye doctor decide. Contact lenses are not toys and you have to be very responsible when using them.  But this is an option for you.|`|GFNJc7spaa	You definitely need to see an eye doctor. Double vision and headaches when performing visual tasks are not normal, but a diagnosis is not possible without further examination.<br>  <br>  Whether or not one can or should wear contacts should only be decided in consultation with a doctor specialising in the eye, because they must be fitted to the exact curvature and shape of the eye.<br>  <br>  Every school and teacher is required to make reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities and an inability to see the board clearly probably qualifies. Tell the doctor that you want to sit closer to the board and he or she should be able to write a note to the effect that it's necessary at least for the time required to obtain glasses or make other arrangements.|`|NaY2OmGgaa	sounds like you need glasses but if you want contacts im sure you could get in replacement of the glasses. but they are a lot harder to deal with considering you have to keep them clean and they kinda hurt when you put them in because you are pracically touching your eyeball.|`|IdAHdu9laa	you really need to visit an optician|`|BkMjabPvaa	you need glasses/contacts hun|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	you definitely need corrective lenses of some sort. as long as you can afford it, you can def. get contacts
qV8Vz36Iaa	Spot reduction does not work. You can tone muscle, but fat loss happens in the order it was put on.<br>  <br>  The best exercise is aerobic where you monitor your heart rate and keep it in a safe and comfortable aerobic zone for a period of up to an hour at a time. If you are fit and healthy and your doctor OKs the exercise, then you should work up to about one hour of exercise five days per week.<br>  <br>  As far as diet is concerned:<br>  <br>  Do not eat: Fat, butter, meat, eggs, oils, fish, refined carbs, sugars, fructose, and juices.<br>  <br>  Do eat: About one teaspoon of good fat (oil) per day. Eat beans, brown rice, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.<br>  <br>  This is a low-fat vegan diet that helps assure that you minimize the risks associated with the typical Western diet loaded with fats. The typical American diet has high incidents of:<br>  <br>  +Obesity<br>  +High Blood Pressure<br>  +Heart Disease<br>  +Some specific cancers<br>  + Diabetes<br>  <br>  Populations who are active and eat a low-fat vegetarian diet have very low incidents of the above disease.<br>  <br>  I lost 40 pounds of fat on this diet, and my blood work is perfect. You stay with this lifestyle change because you feel alert and alive.|`|HhKOOX8zaa	both for the best results.|`|N58YMuuxaa	you have to eat organic food and really work out. <br>  1) NUTS every day it helps keep the muscles toned. Nuts are a rich source of protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, amino acids and most importantly the  good fats that we need in our diets every day. Macadamias, Cashews, Pecans, Almonds ...provide important minerals to exercisers, including potassium to regulate heartbeat and circulate oxygen in the muscles, magnesium to support muscle exertion and zinc for metabolizing energy. Minerals promote strong muscles and bones, cardiovascular health and nervous system function. <br>  2) FRUITS long as you know which fruits to eat, when to eat them and how much to eat, the best time to eat fruit is immediately upon waking, or 30-60 minutes before a workout. It help increase energy and help support growth of muscles or burning fat and shaping up in other words. Bananas, apricot, apples (and eat the seed of the apricot it has vitamin b17)<br>  3) ORGANIC VEGGIES. All the green plants you can throw into a salad . Have fun with it, make a Greek salad- cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, grape tomatoes, olives, carrots shredding (use a knife to skins it into the salad) and goat cheese (or blue cheese).<br>  4) you might wanna go to GMC and get a shake also that will boost your energy, while working out, yes... you will have to work out, start like 15mins a day to just wake up yer body muscles, it will relief stress to and in like 2 weeks go to 20 min, the by the 4 week 30min of aerobics and rotations (hope you have dumb bells).<br>  5) give me a call and we'll hit the beach in july XD|`|Am1JsWmAaa	The hardest part IMO with getting healthy is getting a proper diet setup. There is so much and it just gets confusing. <br>  <br>  First off, there is no way to target fat removal, so you will loose fat from all over. Second, you're not gonna see revolutionary results in 2 weeks, if you drop more then 1 pound a week your loosing fat AND muscle mass which will only make you look anorexic. So start by cutting out all crap out of your diet, fizzy drinks, candy, bad food, chocolate. NONE OF THIS. 1 chocolate bar equals about one jogging trip. It may seem hard at first but after a while you get used to it and in the end you won't even care for these kinds of stuff. I was a major soda-drinker but now I just find it too sweet, I also don't eat candy anymore because it now gives me a headache from all the suger.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, exercise, start out maybe 2-3 times a week and gradually increase to 4-5, make sure you are having FUN exercising. I can't stress this enough. Once you get health you won't go back, it's quite addicting to see yourself improve, but you're only setting up for failure if you don't like what you're doing.|`|EYtgKEPjaa	MAN THE HARPOONS.<br>  <br>  but for srs, both.|`|nl599d8laa	just work out that will help trust me i did it|`|w0ZDe89Laa	Exersize and eat right! cut out fats and grease and eat lower fat or non fat foods. Not so much soda and those kinds of drinks, more milk and water...the average stuff, but still give in once in a while so you can be happy. Do lunes for the legs and crunches for the abs. they really do work, but you will feel the burn. if you have a gym membership or it's a possibility, go for it! I've had a membership at the Y for a year and i love love love it!! I go about three times a week with my best friend and go to lots of fun classes and work out in the gym. It makes it fun that way, I haven;t lost that much weight but I'm much more toned...I had fat thighs and i still do but they're not so much fat as just big (they're thicker and not so flabby).

jej0Vnudaa	It can go away, but then again, it might not.  The thing is, you can go through periods where you aren't feeling so depressed. Then you might think you are really better and that you don't need help when that may not be the case.  Sometimes you can fall back into depression.  <br>  <br>  Seeking help is not easy, but if you feel you need to, then by all means do it.  But let me give you this advice: if you don't like your therapist or doctor, go to another one.  When I was in high school, I really was suffering a lot, so I went to a counselor.  Well, she didn't help me at all.  Eventually, as an adult, I did get some help that I needed, but like I said, if the person isn't helping you, you can always see someone else.  I think it also frees you in a way to realize this because then you know that you have nothing to lose.|`|31wQMeMcaa	You could talk to your pediatrician if you trust him or her, and she can give you the name of a good therapist. Or, if you don't want to talk to him/her, just google therapists and the area where you live, and you can find lots of good therapists. It's important to talk to someone because no one wants to be sad, even if it's just a phase. Teen years are the hardest because it's awkward and depressing and school is stressful. If you don't want to go to a therapist, you could talk to your doctor about medication, but that is more of a last resort and you should be seeing a therapist even if you are on medication. Anyway, I think it would really help to talk to someone about it, maybe if you even just start with your mom or dad or someone you are really close to. There is nothing to be ashamed of and it probably is just a phase, but you should still do something about it because it might not go away by itself.|`|WX1g8lcxaa	I think your problem is right there.

If you feel you need to speak to a professional then I would recommend you go. I wished someone would have told me to talk to a counsellor when I was your age, I think it may have made things alot easier. If you dont want to talk to a professional, talk to a friend or a parent or someone who you trust and get on with.

Recurrent inflammation can lead to pre-cancerous changes in the gut lining.<br>  <br>  For healthy people, eating chilli won't be a problem. In fact, the fibre in the beans is more likely to protect you against colon cancer. The mechanism here is that the good bacteria in your gut use fibre as a food source. The byproduct of this is short-chain-fatty-acids (SCFAs) which are an important food source for the cells lining the bowel. The bulk of bacteria (healthy poo is roughly 2/3 bactera) cleans the inside of the bowel, flushing out toxins and carcinogens.
bQ4RAi07aa	First of all, if you are having recurrent shoulder pain that is worse with working out, then you have likely caused the damage/problem from that activity.  Things to look at, is your lifting technique/form appropriate?, can you control the weight without straining?, do you perform repetitive overhead work in your career field?, do you have a painful arc of motion when lifting your arm to the side over your head?  <br>  <br>  You may have impingement syndrome, or an inflamed bursa.  Both of these conditions are considered to be caused by repetitive motion injury, and strengthening the rotator cuff musculature will not help to correct them.  Do you have cracking sounds?  Can be scar tissue or adhesions around the inflamed area...this will tend to make cracking noises when stretched and moved.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do for these issues is to restrict repetitive motions over the head, weight train less frequently and with less weight, and reduce activity of the affected shoulder joint for a period or 4-6 weeks.  This will give the joint time to reduce inflammation, and the tissue time to heal.  Additionally, cross friction massage on the front of the should can help to eliminate and adhesions that may have developed...it will be very sore though, and you will need to drink plenty of water to aid in the elimination of the inflammation, and utilize ice for pain.<br>  <br>  If you continue to experience pain...go get it evaluated with functional orthopedic tests by a sports trained chiropractic physician or an orthopedist.  Come to think of it, you should make an appointment to have it examined anyway.  Good luck|`|trJdcgQdaa	vikoden|`|ICtwYntuaa	It's probably just a pulled muscle or tendon (otherwise you'd be in way more pain).  Over-the-counter analgesics (tylenol, advil, etc) work fine for pain.  If you don't want pills, you can try a product called Icy Hot - it's a patch that helps relieve muscle tension.

Before it was out I needed 2 mg morphine in a pump every 1-2 hours to just feel "less" pain from the attacks I was suffering while in the hospital. I was terrified when they told me I needed surgery that night but I've been better with the surgery than without it. Plus I'd be dead without the surgery since my gallbladder was going to burst and kill me!
vnKO3h4Jaa	ahhh. getting your braces on! What a fun, fun experience! First of all, they will put tight rubber bands called "spacers" behind your back teeth to make space for "bands" that they will put on when you get your braces on. While you have spacers in, make sure not to eat anything chewy like gum, candy, ect. because it will take the elastics right off of your teeth. also, dont eat anything too stringy like celery, or stringy steak because it will push the eleastics up into your gums. (This happened to me and trust me it hurts a lot). ok. so now we have the spacers done. Now we move on to getting the actual braces on. This usually happens the same appointment that you get your spacers out. The first thing that they will do will be to put lip stretchers on so that your saliva doesnt get on the work that they are doing. Next, they will put your bands on, which go around each back tooth. these anchor all of the braces on. They will then move on to the other bracesand cement them on with a flourecent light that will harden the stuff they put on to adhere each brace. then, depending on what they have decided they will do, they will put a certian sized wire on. then, you will pick a color and these arent just for decoration, they keep the wire in place. after this is done they show you how to care for your new braces and may give you a little kit for them. I am not going to lie. The first week with braces on hurt reaaaaallllllly bad. I suggest taking Motrin or Tylenol to curve the pain. Be sure to stock up on very soft foods that you can eat. Make sure you really listen to your doctor and do what they tell you and you will have a beautiful new smile in no time!!! Good luck with your new braces!<br>  ~Southern at Heart|`|fQ881MwBaa	procedure is as follows<br>   first your teeth will be analized to see if you need and adjustments before you get the braces, in my case, i had to have a palat breaker that over a week broke the bone in the roof of my mouth, then your teeth will be cleaned, and they wil just simply glue on the litle metal pieces, and use small rubber bands to hold a wire in place. after about 3 hours of getting them, your gonna be in horrible pain. ''worst feeling of my entire life''. no joke. so it'd be best if you took an asprin before you go in. then after that is the easy part, just wait. if you have the opportunity, i'd reccomend invisaline. its a clear plastic piece that slids on your teeth, its practiclly invisible to anyone else, and its not as painful. and it is more effective than braces.|`|uMUqOWzKaa	i just got braces in October... The process it they fit the bands on your teeth, then they take the bands off and put glue in them... then they start the glue on the brakets...( idk how to spell that) but then they connect the wire... then they tell you about them.. give you medication ( if you want ) then your off... It just takes while to get on ...|`|ls5uUgx8aa	well this was my process...i went in there got some molds done of my mouth and stuff then they put some spacers in for a week or two then they put braces on..........they suck balls....they hurt like hell for about idk just a while. you cant eat nothing hard for the longest which is like chips, candy, meat.....anything...i just ate mashed tatas for ever until it stopped hurting.......hah yeah|`|xtEiQ9TBaa	i would also like to know that!!|`|nCPHzyZHaa	well<br>  <br>  they usually<br>  put the brackets on with glue and then they shine a blue light on it to dry<br>  <br>  then they put the wire in between them and you pick colors and they put them on w/ a tool <br>  <br>  hope you have fun picking colors|`|LuAO4Ukxaa	Well here is the deal...<br>  <br>  First they will take some x-rays.<br>  <br>  Second they will find out if you need to have teeth pulled and will see if/how many wisdom teeth you will have.<br>  <br>  Third they will set a date to pull teeth if needed.<br>  <br>  Fourth they will put spacers in your mouth a week or two after having your teeth pulled.<br>  <br>  Fifth they will take the spacers out and put the braces on about 2-3 weeks after having spacers. The process..... they fit the bands on your teeth, then they take the bands off and put glue in them... then they start the glue on the brakets...but then they connect the wire... then they tell you about them.. give you medication if you want it then your off... It just takes while to get on ...<br>  <br>  Sixth the will put a bar in your mouth a week or two after putting the braces in your mouth.<br>  <br>   It will hurt after having them put on but take advil and you will be fine. <br>  <br>  Good Luck let me know how it goes.

I have it as well and I have a lot of the same problems that I deal with on a daily basis. <br>  <br>  Do your parents have insurance? If so I would suggest talking to them about it and see if they would mind taking you to see a psychologist. It's really nothing to be ashamed of or afraid of. I have been going to my psychologist for 3 years and my life has changed drastically!<br>  <br>  I have dealt with my problems a lot of my life and just in the last few years have I been able to feel normal again! I go to a counselor once a month and I am also on medication.  But a lot of times not everyone needs medication. Counseling does A LOT of good!!!<br>  <br>  I really hope you will consider this, because living life like that is so hard!  But whatever you decide, don't ever let anyone tell you that you are crazy or a bad person. These things can happen to anyone and no one has the right to judge you!

Your going thru puberty.  <br>  your doing better than me though.  when i went thru it i had no idea i was doing it.  legs growing, hips, etc,  i wont go too far.  just be aware of it.  take your vitamins etc.  ask what special supplements help.  but again, knowing about it is the biggest part of it.  you may not trust your mom or dad but you should, trust me they went thru this as well,  and if its not puberty talk to them anyway.  they may want to see a doctor to have you looked over, which isn't a bad idea.  seriously chill and know your not alone.|`|L03tP6xiaa	Well hun since you are 14 it could be puberty, BUT on the other hand it could also be bipolar disorder / Manic depression.

Do you have an older brother or sister that used to beat on you or still does? I usually want to stay away from everyone. The nice ones try to stay alone and the mean, angry ones try to do what you are currently suffering from. I am surprised that you would come out like this. Usually they say that they have no problems. It shows that you want to end this and become a more friendly person. I also get mad at others that are wrong, but you know you are right abotu it. I just don't get inot a aurgument anymore. I usually pretend that I am unsure an pull up proof and say "oh, guess I was right" in a sly sneaky way to prove they are wrong or ask them how much they would bet on it. Try getting more rest to calm the anger and kill the boredness. You need a close friend to tell them your problems as it usually helps to release that build up in anger. Lastly, try doing a few exercise events such as jumping on the trampolene, jogging, jump roping, etc. to burn of the excess anger. I can't think of much else as I don't have a personal experience in this.|`|SXS2Gf72aa	It sounds like you're just hormonal as hell.

But its probably depression. It really really really sicks, i know EXACTLY how you feel. I would recommend getting a psychiatrist. They are very helpful. <br>  <br>  Also.. This sounds weird. But i have conversations with myself everyday when i get home from school and i list out all the bad things that happened to me that day, and then i list out how i could of handled them more positively. Then i list out all the good things that happened to me that day and then why it was good i handled them positively. I've doing it for a few months and i've noticed that the list of good things has grown.

It's good that you recognize all of those things now, before you get completely out of control. You have the option to choose who you want to be and what you want to be like. If you don't like all of the things listed above, change them. It won't be an overnight change. It will take time and patience. Just try to catch yourself when you get impatient and want to scream or hit someone and take a deep breath. Walk away from the situation for a little while and regather your thoughts. Decide for yourself, "Do I really want to be a mean, manipulative, controlling person? Or do I want to be kind, patient, and understanding?" <br>  <br>  If you continue down the path you're on, you will lose all connections with everyone. Don't do that to yourself.

xxUbFVeFaa	When you have the flu it can weaken your immune system and leave you susceptible to other infections, such as a sinus infection, upper respiratory infection, or even pneumonia. You won't die, you just need to see your doctor and get some medications. Even if it is not bacterial and an antibiotic is not in order, there are some other medications that your doctor can prescribe to help your symptoms. I had the flu last year, and of course since I am a nurse, I went around with a 102 temp, coughing and wheezing for about 2 weeks before seeing a doctor. I ended up with a severe sinus infection, ear infections in both ears, and an upper respiratory infection. I too thought that I was going to die, but as you can tell I am not dead. Nurses truly are the worst patients.|`|7h5U1mpGaa	You aren't going to die. I sugest going to the doctor to check and see if it's an upper realitory problem.

7wtytRtKaa	Well, I personally I remember wanting to lose weight--not a lot--only about 10 lbs. I signed up for a gym membership and was given a trainer. The knowledge of the trainer drew me in to make me want to exercise. I lost all the weight and I felt REALLY good doing it. I felt better physically and MENTALLY.<br>  <br>  But then one day I stopped. I just got busy and I was going through a tough time. I began to miss the gym. So I started going again and viola! I felt better.<br>  <br>  My happiness came especially from the fact that I felt in control of what I doing. I knew that I was doing something good for my body and my mind.

Martial arts, surfing, soccer, making whoopie, dancing, running and just enjoying being in my body.   Find something you enjoy.  I can't tell you what it is any more than I can tell you who you are.  I personally find "exercises" to be a bit boring, but martial arts is exciting and gets you super fit!  Maybe you could get into parkour, jogging, gymnastics, swimming, dancing or ??? There are literally hundreds of activities you can do that don't consist of cycling on a sore behind watching Oprah.  ugh.|`|dUj7rP2haa	Sometimes you need to experiment to find out what is fun for you.

This does not neccessarily mean that your boyfriend cheated on you, many of us carry the virus for a long time before it shows up in outbreaks. It's very unfortunate but do yourself...

If you try to lose faster, your body will go into "starvation mode" and get very stingy about burning calories while at the same time very efficient about storing any calories that you do provide. And it will make you feel awful. <br>  <br>  There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the "moderate" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. <br>  <br>  Another overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.<br>  <br>  To lose a pound of fat, you need to eliminate about 3500 calories. You can do this by burning more with exercise or by modifying your diet to reduce intake. If you do a Google search on say, "swimming calories" you will quickly find a website with tables of calories burned for a given exercise. You can use such lists to estimate how many calories you are burning up with your routine.<br>  <br>  For diet, keep a diary for a couple of weeks counting calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat intake. It is easy with online sources of nutritional information (type the name of the food and calories into the Google search engine) and packaging labels. That will let you quickly figure out where the fat is coming from in your diet. <br>  <br>  Fat gives you 9 calories per gram. So take the number of grams of fat, multiply by 9, then calculate what percentage the fat calories are of your total daily calories. Restricting the calories from fat to about 20% of your total intake is ideal for a maintenance diet... that isn't overly restrictive. Of note, you need some fat in your diet. For instance, the body uses fat to produce hormones. Once you have a picture of how to modify your diet, you can drop the diary and just go back to it occasionally if you are wanting to tweek things further.<br>  <br>  There is a subset of questions that goes further and asks about "How to get a six-pack?" The answer is the same. Six-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the "core is active" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to build muscle as a way to lose fat, then you may need to increase total calories and specifically your protein intake. I target about 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight each day when actively building. That is far more protein than most people need in their diets.|`|PcZKl55paa	you should try to burn calories w/ cardio like running, jogging, biking. or just excersise any way or sit ups push ups and then eat a lot of celery. and then dont each much else but make sure you drink a lot and still get some proteins. and dont go crazy anorexic/bulimic|`|TlAy19i6aa	Exercise, and eat healthy.<br>  No high fat foods.|`|03g0WSvZaa	try the lil Jack workout <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a>|`|7r4paUFhaa	Well, that depends.

Other than that I would suggest you try to eat a 1200-2000 calorie diet consisting of fruits and vegetables and lean sources of protein and complex carbohydrates (oatmeal, brown rice, porridge).

gKKD8Aayaa	What is masturbation?<br>  <br>  Masturbation is stimulation of the genitals for the purpose of advancing sexual arousal. Most people masturbate until they have an orgasm.<br>  <br>  How do females masturbate?<br>  <br>  Most females rub the area around the clitoris, the clitoris itself, or the inner labia. Some females insert fingers or objects into the vagina.<br>  <br>  How many girls masturbate?<br>  <br>  Half of teenage girls masturbate regularly, and 75 percent will do so before their 18th birthdays.<br>  <br>  When do girls start to masturbate?<br>  <br>  Most start during or soon after puberty. A few start before puberty. Many don't start masturbating until their late teens, and some females never masturbate.<br>  <br>  How often do females masturbate?<br>  <br>  Most females masturbate once or twice a week. A few do it daily. Many females masturbate once a month or less.<br>  <br>  Why do people masturbate?<br>  <br>  The main reason is that it's fun. Some females also masturbate to relieve menstrual cramps or to help them sleep. Males also masturbate because they produce sexual fluids that need to be eliminated frequently.<br>  <br>  Where do people masturbate?<br>  <br>  Most females masturbate in bed.<br>  <br>  Where is the clitoris?<br>  <br>  The external female genitalia are called the vulva. The part you can see is the outer labia (lips). If you open your outer labia, the clitoris is right at the top. It's surrounded by a hood and is very sensitive to the touch, so many girls touch only the hood. Below the clitoris are the inner labia.<br>  <br>  What does an orgasm feel like?<br>  <br>  The main feeling is a series of muscular contractions inside the pelvis that lasts for about eight seconds. People usually have other feelings resulting from these contractions, like an overall feeling of warmth, and pleasure spreading throughout the body. Many people need to moan or scream as a result of the tension.<br>  <br>  If I masturbate, am I no longer a virgin?<br>  <br>  Masturbating does not make you not a virgin. You need to engage in sexual intercourse to do that.<br>  <br>  What about my hymen? Does masturbation hurt the hymen?<br>  <br>  The hymen is a thin piece of skin that covers the vaginal opening in young women. It breaks and tears with sexual activity (and occasionally by non-sexual activity), generally over a long period of time. Masturbating with objects will tend to destroy your hymen. Most women have small pieces of hymen left until they give birth for the first time. The hymen has little to do with virginity. You can be a virgin and have almost no hymen left, or you can have a nearly intact hymen and not be a virgin.<br>  <br>  Can I hurt myself by masturbating?<br>  <br>  For most females, masturbation is healthy. There are three methods of masturbating that should be avoided:<br>  <br>     1. You can hurt yourself if you stick anything into your urethra while masturbating (or any other time, for that matter). (The urethra is the tube in the opening where urine comes out.)<br>     2. You should exercise care when inserting objects into your vagina for the first time. Inserting something before your vagina is relaxed enough can cause injury.<br>     3. You can hurt yourself if you masturbate in a face-down position. Masturbation should be performed on your back, although you can try it sitting or standing once you've learned it on your back. Masturbating face-down might cause problems when you someday try to have sex with a partner. This is a troublesome condition documented in males called Traumatic Masturbatory Syndrome, or TMS. There is some evidence that TMS is a problem for females too. <br>  <br>  What is a dildo? What is a vibrator? Should I use them?<br>  <br>  A dildo is an object shaped like a penis that some women use for masturbating. A vibrator is an electric appliance that some women use for masturbating. Dildos are usually inserted into the vagina, while vibrators are usually used on the vulva (clitoris and labia). It's a good idea to masturbate with your hands for a few years before using objects or vibrators.<br>  <br>  If I use an object anyway, what should I do to be safe?<br>  <br>  Only use objects that are smooth and not sharp. Only use objects big enough to hold firmly. And be sure to clean them before and after each use.<br>  <br>  Is it OK to masturbate in groups?<br>  <br>  Masturbation is supposed to be a solo activity. You should not engage in sexual behaviors with other people until you've been masturbating for a few years and are comfortable with your body. If another girl asks you to masturbate with her, tell her that it's a private activity. If she's not your friend, or if she's older and more experienced then you, it's possible that she wants to hurt you in some way, and you should tell a parent or another authority.<br>  <br>  Most people regard touching the genitals of another female for purposes of sexual gratification as homosexual activity. You should keep that in mind if you decide to masturbate with other females.<br>  <br>  Do adult women masturbate?<br>  <br>  Yes. Once people start to masturbate, they will do it for the rest of their lives, whether or not they have sex with partners too.<br>  <br>  How do males|`|22b2526e989f9510febf3299156876c2aa	when they get horny or lonely! duh|`|HzCBOwlyaa	when ever they want or feel comfortable with themselves and their bodies:) now I do it at least 3 times a week when Im not sexually active ..but thats jus me could be different for everyone and I started at 21|`|FWWegktKaa	Whenever they want to, there is no age limit or whatever.

It helps couples share and strengthen their bond, even in the later stages of life.<br>  <br>  Usually in this stage of marriage, the guy has had a vasectomy or your mom would have her tubes tied if they don't intend on giving you more siblings. Birth control is dangerous to older women because it is more likely to cause clots and heart disease in women over 35.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure they still bang each other. :) It all depends on the couple for frequency, though.

nwFv7Nwxaa	Its 'normal' persay for both boys and girls to touch themselves. Its like discovering they have toes for the first time ...  Its new and they are discovering their own bodies and finding out what feels good and what dont feel good.  We start this young and develope as we grow up.<br>  <br>  In my opinion its more harmfull to punish him/her for discovering his/her own body, for to find something out about your body isnt wrong.  If it were wrong to discover things about our bodies, none of us would realize we have toes or that we have different 'thingies'.  <br>  <br>  If we teach our children that its wrong to discover, then we teach our children that its wrong to tell you what hurts.  What happens then if say our 'thingy' hurts but Mommy or Daddy says its wrong to touch or look so does that leave the child to think that telling you  about it is wrong too?<br>  <br>  Again, in my opinion, find out why he is doing this so much.  If he trust you enough to tell you, then finding out shouldnt be a problem.  If this turns into something that is causing him more harm then good (rubbing himself raw or hurting himself in other ways) then I would suggest your Ped. Doc could recommend someone to see.<br>  <br>  Most Ped Docs will tell you its normal to touch and play ... however the rest of this is my opinion only.  For we all have different beliefs and such.<br>  <br>  Be open, be honest ... give him privacy to discover himself.  If this turns into a hurting situation then have him looked at, otherwise eventually he'll get bored and move onto a different part of his body.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Dont know about ol' Daddy there.  If he is doing this in front of his son then that is a problem.  Document it if your son tells you such events are happening.  Date, time and put into words exactly what your son tells you, using his words not your own.  I would also discuss this with ol' Daddy and document that you have discussed this with him.  A constant journal to this sort of behavior is very important.  <br>  <br>  The more you document the more the judge tends to listen, but remember if your documenting what your son is telling you, USE HIS WORDS.  <br>  <br>  Dealing with judges and these things I have much experience on, probably too much ....

xMlL7CKcaa	a lethal does of Morphine Sulfate would be around 120-250 mg.  But you have to keep in mind variables with narcotic drugs.  If slow release caps are broken or chewed, then ingested, then that regular dose can also be fatal.  Another variable is that what is lethal for one person, may not be for another.. one may build up a tolerance for the narcotic, where as someone else just starting the drug, may hit them harder.  Try searching with the spelling of "Sulfate" you may have better luck finding info spelt that way.|`|LWmo7lOpaa	There are just too many variables involved. A person with a large opioid tolerance can take over 100x the amount that would kill someone with no tolerance and be just fine.<br>  <br>  Generally, any oral dose of 120mg or greater, or intravenous dose of 20mg or greater, in an opioid-naive individual is where it starts to get dangerous and potentially deadly.

T6N7AdB0aa	I've read some articles in "Men's Health" magazine and the only advice i can give on muscle building is to eat meat after you finish working out so it can repair the muscle making it bigger, faster.|`|1oNi2v38aa	I don't know if that qualifies as weight lifting.|`|A4nB8scAaa	12 reps but let your muscles rest on the week end (:|`|2UzvWNMSaa	that is too many sets (not reps).  You should be doing about 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions (reps) per exercise. you should allow one or two rest days in between each muscle group.  you can do both chest and arms on the same day, but allow a day or two to rest until the next workout.  or you can bench one day and do arms the next. you should also be doing some sort of back exercises to balance the chest muscles, and some leg exercises as well. don't forget some cardiovascular training most days as well.  abs about 3 days a week.  talk to your pe coach or a trainer at the gym for advice.
EhfGorc9aa	Yes, you are anorexic.   Read "Surviving Ophelia" and try to eat more.<br>  Look at how you cope with stress and explore your self-esteem.<br>  Its not easy being a young girl in today's society. There's always somebody criticizing you or telling you what you should be like. <br>  When I was young, I was anorexic too, but I didn't believe it and denied it and felt fat because I had a little tummy protrusion (normal).  I didn't diet though, I just had no interest in food, except occasionally.  My family always nagged me about being skinny and anorexic.  It wasnt until I was much older and I looked at my photos of me when I was 12 to 20 that I was horrified at what a stick figure I was!  Listen to what other people are telling you that love you.  I tried to gain weight with appetite stimulant medicine and high protein drinks and I still did not gain weight for years.  I think because my stomach was so small and I didnt like that stuffed feeling.  Just try to eat normal meals and take a vitamin.|`|VpIHLUgqaa	you are not definatly anorexic if you eat then you are not most girls you age think they are fatter than they really are being 90 pounds and 5'1 is actually great I am 5'4 and 115 pounds and I'm 13 so I think you should wait for your body to grow a little more see what happens then and then do something healthy if you still feel this way like eating healthy and exercising because if you anorexic you not really skinny your just skin and bones which is not good at all
ldfE9vNGaa	You could be anemic perhaps, or have a low grade infection that is dragging you down. There are also other possibilities, but only your doctor can really make a diagnosis.<br>  <br>  There is one other idea. Do you know if you snore? There's a type of sleep disorder called Sleep Apnea, and one of the major symptoms is snoring. Many people don't even know they have this problem, and think they sleep well, but they don't. In fact they wake up over and over again at night, but don't realize or remember.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below for more info. on this, and if you think you could be experiencing this, see your doctor for more advice.|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	It's good you get enough sleep, but how good is the sleep you're getting? Make sure when you go to bed that everything is turned off and that your body is completely relaxed. The better the sleep, the more energy you'll have. The caffeine didn't do anything because all caffeine does is get a person hyped up and then has them crash down to a worse condition then before. Caffeine doesn't always have an effect on people either, I can drink a pot of coffee and not get hyper. <br>  <br>  Remember, quality, not quantity.|`|6LOw7jZpaa	maybe your anemic<br>  go to your doctor :)
bHA2K4HYaa	We have our own health care facility. Porn stars are tested monthly (if not more. Depends on how much you work). We have some of the most advanced STD testing available. For HIV/AIDS we use PCR DNA testing. (The HIV/PCR DNA qualitative test will detect early HIV infection by looking for the inhibitory substance of the HIV virus itself. This test typically will find HIV between 10 and 14 days after exposure.) The HIV Elisa test (which is normally given to the general public unless other wise requested or stated by your testing facility) looks for the person’s antibody response to the HIV virus. This test will detect HIV between 6 weeks and 6 months of exposure. So with all our testing requirements many performers feel comfortable enough to not use condoms.|`|CtgBMZewaa	that stuff is fake|`|OVtUnuYnaa	it adds to the effect|`|a7755f42f69cefa52515f7b509e000ceaa	Actually, a LOT of porn that I watch has men who wear condoms. What kind of porn do you watch? If it's amateur, then they could just be inexperienced with sex like a lot of people and not realize the need for condoms. <br>  <br>  Also, the girl could be on BC or something.|`|SS5py9jIaa	hehe. errr.. maybe she is on the pill. <br>  <br>  I think pregnancy is the least of her worries. A lot of gay porn you see these days has guys wearing condoms.. you're right... sending the right message is very important community service.|`|o6o4KiBOaa	Sometime the girls could take birth control or the guy make fake the sex. Porn in movies is fake anyway. Especially anal se*|`|obIMwp99aa	maybe the girl got "fixed"? lol|`|B6ioLtejaa	Porn stars are nasty and most are drug addicts. Alot of Porn Stars do get prego and STDs are always a threat. Every couple of years an AIDS scare goes through the adult industry. The main reason is that the audience does not like to see condoms being used. Movies where condoms are not used tend to sell more copies. More importantly though is do chicks really like ATM as seen in most porn flicks?|`|iQeVDlnOaa	There is that chance but it feels better and the feel it is more exciting to the viewer without one.Besides they all pull out before they do ***.|`|gXhQ12Lkaa	IT's Porn ...|`|qaaiZovWaa	Because they are nasty|`|lofDs9Pxaa	i think the guys have to get a vassectamy(sp?) <br>  but yeahhhhhhhhh

But I would go and see the doctor he can take blood tests to make sure you haven't caught anything worse.|`|hq9rM7Eqaa	On the outside of your mouth, carmex works 4 me.  I've also poked holes in the blisters with a sterilized pin, washed with dial, then dabbed the blisters with a q-tip soaked in straight bleach.

The virus can be spread to other areas of your face if you pick at it.<br>  Step2<br>  Wash your face and hands often with hot water and anti bacterial face. Stopping the spread of the virus will help you get rid of cold sores quickly.<br>  Step3<br>  Use some form of L-lysine based ointment to cover the cold sore, and when you apply it go from the edges in to make sure you don't spread it to surrounding areas. Put the cream on thick to prevent further infection. and get rid of the cold sore quickly.<br>  Step4<br>  Try to determine what the triggers were that brought on the cold sore outbreak and avoid them or take preventive measures before the outbreak starts.<br>  Step5<br>  Take L-Lysine tablets every few hours. This is a highly rated treatment with some people swearing it ends an outbreak in days instead of weeks. I've linked some of the best products available in the resource section below, they will certainly help you to get rid of a cold sore quickly.|`|bI3areCsaa	Carmex works good for me!

AA10299265	I exercise right through illness... if I can. Since I started focusing on strengthening my immune system, I rarely get sick for more than 18 hours. And even then, I haven't gotten sick enough to miss work in the past two years. <br>  <br>  I'm taking astragalus and selenium supplements along with a multivitamin, if you were wondering.|`|BOiBe1mIaa	If you are at 60% recovery...go back to your routine at 60% rather than "all out"|`|kCDzXCCKaa	I've had the same problem for the last few weeks. I had been working out regularly and then I caught a bug that was going around. I'm feeling better and I just got back to the gym a few days ago. I probably waited to long to get back into my routine tho. I think I could have got back to it a week ago and started feeling a lot better quicker. So I think you should do a light workout and then increase the intensity each day until you feel normal again. If you get to feeling bad or sick during the workout you need to stop tho. You can push it when you get to feeling better again.<br>  <br>  How do you like the p90x system? I've seen it advertised on television and thought it looked like a good system.
t8kykME3aa	You might exhaust yourself and reach a plateau. It depends on many factors like your age, body type, genetics, the amount of rest you get every day, what you eat and so on. But doing it day after day might break you down in the end. You need some break to let your muscles recover and grow. You might actually lose time working out every moment while you could use the time for something else. <br>  What is actually your goal? If you want to reach certain repetitions in a specified amount of time it is way better to follow a specific program. Here is an example for pull-ups (combined with push-ups):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pull-ups-training.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pull-ups-training.com/</a><br>  <br>  And one for push-ups:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hundredpushups.com/</a><br>  <br>  Both these programs emphasize the need for rest.<br>  Good luck!

nAp688tZaa	There are no medications or instruments that will help this problem.  You need to realize that sex hurts for the first few times with most women.  You need to take it slow with her and make sure that she is ready, physically, before you start.  Try using a water based lubricant which should help tremendously.  You might need to invest a little more time in foreplay for a while, just to make sure that she is aroused.  She is also very likely a little nervous and tense, which can make the first couple of times that much more uncomfortable.  Give her a massage before the foreplay and sex to relax her.  Let her know that you love her very much and only want her to be happy with both your emotional and physical connections.  This will help.  It just takes time.  After the 3r or 4th time, it should start to feel good for her, and this is when you need to start looking for ways to get her to achieve the same level of physical pleasure as you, as in, find a way that works for her to orgasm during sex!|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	WOW ! A vargin? Never had one of those.|`|ELeKAparaa	There are multiple reasons your wife might be finding sex painful.  Her first stop needs to be a doctor to make sure her hymen is not intact.  If it is, he can take care of that and there shouldn't be anymore problems.<br>  <br>  Other issues can be lack of lubrication which is easily solved now days.  Just go to the local drug store and you'll find a variety of lubricants, some with decent flavors in case you start one activity and want to move to another, if you catch my drift.  You also should make sure your wife is aroused - unlike men, they take more than 15 seconds to get ready for sex.<br>  <br>  Last problem could be your size - if you're rather large, go slowly and stop if she says it is hurting her.<br>  <br>  One final bit of advice...  it sounds like this has been a problem for more than just one time, so don't expect your wife to be suddenly ready for sex.  Take things slow and easy.  Remember that there are more ways to have a good time than being inside her and it's up to you to introduce her to those methods.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|S5IOQSYtaa	Yes.It's easy.You can use tiny,shaped blade.But don't forget to put it away.Otherwise you penis may be damaged.If you can't do that job i cant do that on behalf of you. :D <br>  Otherwise you have to find out another girl,Srilankans are better to select visit :<br>  <a href="http://lankanxgirls.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://lankanxgirls.blogspot.com</a>|`|H6GIYDdzaa	Your penis.<br>  <br>  Sex hurts at first for females.

Vk7kkrcLaa	What you have described is very common among loads of people. Many people do not like the thought of someone else touching their eyes but think they will manage ok if they do it themselves - and eventually most do manage to do it themselves. You seem to be very motivated and that is a brilliant start.<br>  <br>  Whenever I have a patient like you, the best thing I advise is the following:<br>  <br>  wash your hands with antibacterial soap and practice touching the white part of your eye a few times. This will help your mind adapt to a finger coming towards your eye - is think automatically causes a strong blink reflex.<br>  <br>  Practice this a few times everyday before you go back to see your eye doctor - and then hopefully he will be able to fit you woth contact lenses at your next visit. This tends to work very well with all my patients<br>  <br>  all the best with your lenses

But it doesn't happen in two weeks.<br>  <br>  Not even through surgery do you get results that quickly.<br>  <br>  How about instead of worrying about getting a flat stomach in two weeks, you learn to LOVE your body the way it is now, and then work on getting that stomach the healthy way?|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	I don't know about doing it in two weeks, but my mom read in a health magazine that if you sprint, or push your body really hard for a short amount of time, then stop for five seconds, then do it again, you can get rid of the muffin top.|`|gKKD8Aayaa	tep1<br>  Understand the anatomy of the abdominal muscles. Your abs are located in the midsection of your body. They are made up of the transverse abdominus, rectus abdominus, internal obliques and external obliques. The transverse abdominus is a deep muscle. It wraps around the entire abdominal area and helps to stabilize the trunk. The internal and external obliques are located along the sides of the rectus abdominus, and assist the body with lateral, or bending and twisting, movements. On top of the transverse abdominus and in between the obliques is the rectus abdominus. As you can see from the illustration, it is divided into right and left sides and is in sections. It is a well-toned rectus abdominus that creates that six-pack look.<br>  <br>  Having well-toned abs is not just important for appearance: Strong abdominal muscles help you maintain better posture and balance, and prevent back pain and injury. Your abdominal muscles are the core of your body. If your center is strong, it will support you as you move through daily activities and recreation.<br>  Step2<br>  Avoid common misconceptions. Performing situps is not the only requirement for obtaining flat or defined abdominal muscles. While doing exercises targeted to the abdominal muscles can make them stronger, you cannot spot-reduce. It is also important to do a variety of movements. Since the abdominal muscles are large, you can not effectively train the entire muscle or create that six-pack look by doing just one exercise. You must have a routine that takes your abdominal muscles through a variety of movements to fully sculpt and train them.<br>  <br>  Also, to develop that six-pack look you must be within a healthy weight range and have a low percentage of body fat. Your body fat needs to be at 10 percent or lower for men, and at 15 percent or lower for women. So unless you fall into this category, six-pack abs are out of reach. There are many home scales that will measure your percentage of body fat, and many health clubs and gyms offer this service. If you purchase a home model, make sure you follow the directions exactly to get accurate results. These scales are not 100 percent accurate, but they will give you a basic measurement, and you can use them to track your progress.<br>  <br>  In addition, with any form of strength training, results are usually not seen for 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the intensity of your training routine.<br>  <br>  If you are at the required body-fat percentage and you have been working out regularly for some time, and you are doing a well-rounded abdominal workout, you may be able to see some definition happening in 2 weeks. Otherwise, there are steps you need to follow to develop that six-pack look. It takes time and effort to get there.<br>  Step3<br>  Reach a healthy weight and body-fat composition. If you are not currently within the required percentage of body fat, you first need to shed those extra pounds. That means controlling your food intake and getting regular cardiovascular exercise for 40 to 45 minutes at least 5 days per week. This can include using equipment like a treadmill, elliptical machine or bike, or participating in activities like swimming, running or aerobic-exercise classes. It is not recommended that you lose anymore than 2 lbs. per week unless you are under the supervision of a doctor. Weight loss greater than this is not healthy, and shocks the body. Losing weight slowly allows the body to adjust, and the weight tends to stay off. Losing weight is hard, and it is difficult to do it alone. Joining a gym or working out with friends or coworkers makes you more likely to stick with it. There are also programs like Weight Watchers that can guide and support you in reaching your weight-loss goals in a healthy, effective and safe manner.<br>  Step4<br>  Perform crunches. Typical abdominal crunches should be included in your routine. They can be done on the floor, a weight bench, a physioball or a machine. However, you do not need equipment to get six-pack abs. If you have some weights, a physioball and a basic weight bench, you can get the abs you always wanted. If you are new to exercise, start with a basic crunch like the one shown in the video in the Resources section. This is a very safe and effective exercise.<br>  <br>  Many people complain about neck pain when first attempting to do crunches. It is not the exercise that is the problem; it is because they are doing the exercise incorrectly. You must keep your abdominal muscles engaged and your back flat against the floor. You want to keep the elbows back and open, and not pull on the head or neck to come up. It is common to see people clasp their hands behind the head and then bring the elbows together as they lift up. This will create neck pain, and will actually prohibit you from effectively isolating and shaping the abdominal muscles. This is especially true if your abdominal muscles are weak. Weak abdominal muscles cannot lift you up, and many times, people pull themselves up, which stresses the|`|HzCBOwlyaa	start now and start today ! drink alot alot alot of water ..and then start doing some sit ups I swear i dont work out ever but when I have to lose weight or get in shape real quick I do a couple of sit ups and bends , suck in my stomach here and there for a couple mins and I swear i get tones quick and the water helps to flush out some pounds Iam 120- and 5'5 I dont really ever have a gut but when I do this IS the cure all|`|yLrksiQMaa	Ha.

ELeKAparaa	Your husband can try calling his pain doctor, but most pain doctors have a very strict policy about lost prescriptions and medications - so sad, too bad.  It's worth a try though.  If he's been a patient for 5 years he might be able to get a one-time prescription.  <br>  <br>  With the dose that your husband is on, he will go through withdrawal symptoms if he doesn't get something.  If his doctor won't give him a prescription, he'll need to go to the ER and get some that way.  Hopefully, he'll get a doctor that is sympathetic but believe me, not all of them are.<br>  <br>  If he can't get anything from an ER doctor, e-mail me directly and I'll give you some suggestions on what to do.|`|tqhr4V33aa	maybe you can call and explain to them what happen!!|`|56mYVHTyaa	Most doctors will not refill pain medicine early.  They usually have the patient sign a "Pain Contract" stating that they will not try to get early refills (no matter what) and that they will use the same pharmacy.  Unfortunately that is how it usually goes.  You could attempt to get it refilled but from experience (supervisor in doctor office for 8 years), a lot of "drug seekers" use that excuse.  They also like to say it was stolen, they lost it, or it spilled all over the floor, or they left it out of town.  Your best bet would be to take the bottle to the doctor's office and show them the bottle and the residue and see if the doctor would be willing to make an exception.  Good luck!|`|QBFANhXaaa	Unfortunately your husband is right. It's unlikely they will give him any medication before his next appointment. My step-dad has similar problems with military medical service. His fear of being labeled a drug addict is a real fear he should have, because the military is quick to do so. It doesn't matter what his record is. It is a culture in the military that the members should be able to tough it out, so the medical staff often aren't that sympathetic. You could try calling someone, and maybe a miracle will happen and a doctor will be sympathetic, but chances are he will have to live with the pain until the appointment.|`|cCbKTbzSaa	call the surgery,  and you should  get a  tel no for  m doc. <br>  phone that   number, and explain to  him/her what has happened, <br>  and  hopefullly  they will come and  give  you a new  script for him,  <br>  <br>  explain the circumstances ,  husband  being  veteran,  etc. <br>  <br>  ok.  do  not worry   that is what they are there  for.

Drink NO sodas.. not even diet ones they still can give you gas and bloating<br>  <br>  - Switch to brown! That means trade white brea, white rice, white paste t brown pasta, bread and rice.<br>  <br>  - Use no oil in cooking, oven cook everything<br>  <br>  - become more active.. move around a lot more.. for example don't ask someone to pass you the remote get up and get it your self.. run, swim, play wii ( standing up ) do what ever you can to burn calories..<br>  <br>  - Make your meals smaller, half them from your original size..<br>  <br>  - Avoid alllll fast foods.. its terrible for you its full of oil and salt and its the reason why over 50% over Americans are overweight.<br>  <br>  - Go organic or Vegetarian.. When i went vegetarian a few -pounds dropped in weeks without me even trying.<br>  <br>  - Sleep More - The more sleep you get the more your body burns fat.. when your sleeping your body prepares its self.<br>  <br>  - Bring a notebook and pen around with you and write everything you eat, it reallly helps<br>  <br>  - Be determined and motivated without having belief you will never get to where you want to be.. push yourself until you feel happy with your body.<br>  <br>  - Do not eat boxed foods ( ready made mac and cheese and stuff like that ) these foods contains loads of salt and are really bad for you.<br>  <br>  - Get low fat everything ! when you go grocery shopping buy low fat cheese, mayonnaise, ketchups ect..<br>  <br>  - Do not eat two hours before you go to bed.. if you eat and then go straight to sleep, your body will convert the food you ate into fat rather than using it right away as fuel. Ultimately, you'll gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  Any sort of potato chips, even the low-fat ones.<br>  All candy.<br>  All soda, including Diet soda, because it retains water.<br>  Bananas (in excess) They are high in calories.<br>  Butter (in excess)<br>  Oil (in excess) (Try to boil most foods, it REALLY shaves off a lot of fats in your food!)<br>  Nuts (in excess) High in calories.<br>  Bread<br>  Pasta<br>  Rice<br>  Meats (excluding fish, because fish is very healthy)<br>  <br>  Eat lots of:<br>  Fruits, specifically apples and oranges, because they are great-tasting and very low in calories.<br>  Vegetables, especially the following: Carrots, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Onion, Hot Peppers. These veggies are called "Negative Calorie" because it takes more calories to digest them than the amount of calories it has in them to begin with.<br>  <br>  <br>  The way I got rid of belly fat was doing 50 push ups a night, and 50 sit ups. and doing the hula hoop. i lost loads of belly fat and toned up and the best thing was i started to notice results just in the first week or so.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Remember to drink LOTS of water, as it helps with digestion and helps to flush away toxins and bacteria that could cause your body to retain fat.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Link = a toning routine designed for women|`|Z8qBgv8taa	A 2200 calorie diet and running/jogging. It tones every part of the body. Once you get used to the run set it out further and further ie from 1 mile to 2 to 3miles. and add 1-5 pound weights. I would advise running on grass not asphalt or cement as it's not good for your knees or ankles. Also be sure to stretch before your run. Jumping jacks, lunges etc|`|5dxjJppsaa	Not all people have the same metabolism rate. Some burns food fast enough while others don't.|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Okay, well how fast you lose weight all depends on how much you weigh at the moment. For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)

ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	Unfortunately people do not often change in drastic ways. If your boyfriend is being rude to you and treating you badly, he will continue to do so. Ask any victim of spousal abuse. <br>  <br>  If your boyfriend is looking on dating sites and talking to his ex-girlfriend, you need to end the relationship, it's apparent that he's going planning on moving on, with or without you. You can find someone much better that will treat you well. <br>  <br>  You won't feel like you want to change the right man. Obviously he's not the right one.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Many people, don't change drastically like you believe your boyfriend will.

This mutt could end up killing you if you stay with him.  You do not need this jerk.  You will eventually find someone else, but even if you don't it is better to be alone than to be with someone who is mean to you.

ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you're a teenager. Probably a pretty smart one, which is why you seem to associate with adults rather than people your own age. <br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is this. Try as hard as you can in school, and when you get out of school, try to find something you like to do. <br>  <br>  Life is not magical and perfect all of the time. A lot of it is mediocre, but you can't expect greatness to fall into your lap. You have to go and find the fun things, the great things, because they're not going to come to you. <br>  <br>  As much as you think you're not being negative, I really think you are. You might be depressed, or you might just be going through the regular mood cycles of a teenager, but talking to a therapist will help.|`|rIlpqCzmaa	get some skills. at a community college or technical school.   <br>  i think you need more omega 3 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.|`|o5Vv5wkvaa	You need to just take a day where you don't think about any of your imperfections... everyone has them, just some people more than others. maybe go somewhere you enjoy being and just read a book for a few hours. Or do something you know you are good at! there MUST be at least one thing.. and how can you not have any friends other than a grandma figure?! you have to have some other friends!! you may not think that you have a great memory.. i have that problem too, well, for the most part. i remember insignificant things that don't need to be remembered such as what my friend had for lunch last week on tuesday.. (something to that effect...) but i cannot remember anything i need to like what my parents or teachers or anyone for that matter tell me. <br>  but always remember that everyone was put on earth for a reason. You will figure it out sooner or later, maybe you haven't tried doing what your meant to do yet... <br>  hope this helped at least a little bit!<br>  ~Jess|`|kV2uiCAAaa	There is a path out my friend! And a darn good one too!<br>  Jesus Christ. I am a Christian myself, and to be perfectly honest, I think I just might feel little like you If I didn't have christanity in my life. <br>  You are on this world for a reason, you are fearfully and wonderfully made. God made you just the way you are becasue that's how He wanted you to be. Life can be the biggest pain in the rear end, I know that from experience. But keep going, if your not familar with Christianity, talk to someone who does. Don't get a closed-minded view about christianity being some weird religion that people believe in that doesn't make any sense...if you give it some research, you will soon find that it makes a great deal more since than any of those other depressing, hopeless views of life. You ARE here for a purpose, mabye it doesn't seem that way, but you are. As for not being good at anything, let me just tell you something right now buddy, I can see just from your post that you are quite a good writer. Not lasy like a ton of people. Your vocabulary is good, grammer is neat, and you get your point across quite easily. Don't think i'm just saying that to make you feel better...I write a lot, I know. Social skills can always be inproved. Sports are way to over-rated...never played them myself. The vast majority of people are un-orginized. And as for friends...that will come when you figure out just who you are. Have some faith, stop taking a dim outlook on life, and know that God is real, Jesus is real...according to Phillipians 4:13 "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"<br>  God be with you!|`|ICtwYntuaa	Don't be so quick to write off your skills.  Even without knowing anything else about you, I can already see that you are an excellent writer; you have great vocabulary and you use rhetoric very well.  You obviously read a lot, and nothing gives more insight into life and knowledge like books.  I know students who excel at science and mathematics, but cannot convey a single idea like you have so eloquently been able to above.<br>  <br>  It is good that you are able to interact well with adults, that too is a skill.  The best way to make friends is common interests.  Find people who enjoy reading, who enjoy movies, who enjoy writing.  You might have to venture a little bit out of your comfort zone, but it will be well worth it.  Go to a library and browse some books; if you see someone reading casually, strike up a conversation.  If you like each other, you'll have a new friend.  And if it doesn't work out so well, then you'll probably never see each other again anyway.  And just move on to the next person.  There's no pressure, nobody watching.  It's all about what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Should you accept mediocrity?  I wouldn't call it mediocrity, by any means.  But the fact that you're asking the question, I think, means that you simply want someone reinforce the answer that you already have.  Reach for the stars, and if you only snag a planet, then so be it. :)
xMlL7CKcaa	Its scary..  when the oncologist tells you that you only have a short time left to live, its scary yet feels so unreal.  Physically, its difficult as the more the cancer grows, the harder it is to function.  Long hikes turn into shorter ones, long hours at work turn into part time or no working hours.  Yet, in a strange sort of way, I have found that after being dx'd, I look at life much different.  Different in a sense that our own mortality is challenged and life is actually brighter, in a weird way.  Very hard to explain as all of us are different, even if we have the same cancer.  Pain is also a factor, some of us have to learn to live with the constant pain as well.  <br>   I am sure your mom's friend has a whole other set of emotions and physical conditions.
BUI2nlUVaa	The tests are more likely to be positive if the disease is not in remission.  That being said, even people that are having a flare do not always test positive for the Lupus panel.  Only 30% of people who have Lupus test positive.  You would be diganosed by using blood tests, medical history and symptoms.  Lupus can be difficult to diagnose so make sure to continue seeking answers if your doctor doesn't know what you have.|`|18hRm0gLaa	It had to be "active" at some point in your life so that your immune system could make antibodies against it, which is what the lupus test tests for.|`|7uSSJPMKaa	Yes, lupus in an autoimmune disorder.  What they are looking for are specific antibodies that indicate a response.  You definately do not need to be in an acute stage.
0Ye3d4C3aa	tell her that she is your mother not your doctor, and that if she wants to hear about what is going on in your life, she will have to stop trying to diagnose you. and when she says that is a symptom of a mental illness, or that you should try a particular medicine, simply say this conversation is over. let her know that you are an adult, and you have a therapist, and that her "help" is not needed. also mention to her the next time that she says the such and such must be working in response to something you are wanting her to be proud of, tell her that it is something you worked hard for and you would be happy if she recognized your efforts.|`|1oBilGHuaa	I think she is too close to the situation to be involved in treatment planning.

If you just want to live your life and have your own real emotions, both good and bad, kudos to you!<br>  <br>  I'd have to agree that her behavior, as described, is not appropriate, either from a medical point of view or a psychological point of view. And it certainly sounds like a miserable way to grow up! But you're 22 - you're an adult now. So I have to ask... is the important question really about how your mom is acting, or is it about why you're playing along with it?<br>  <br>  Are you living at home and/or financially dependent on your parents? I assume that that's why it's necessary to do all of this hiding and faking to "keep her happy". I would suggest that you could make some real use of your time with the psychologist, by starting to talk with him/her about how you can begin to get some healthy distance from your family of origin and move toward financial and emotional independence. Maybe you're holding yourself back for some reason. After all, home can feel "safe" even when it's unpleasant. If you have the ability to begin to plan your escape, then start planning!<br>  <br>  If you're not dependent on your folks, or don't need to be, then you have a choice to make. It's very difficult to feel like a whole person in your soul when you're constantly hearing that everything you do and feel is some combination of God and drugs, and it's very hard to BE a whole person when you have to go around pretending that you accept that way of seeing it. Playing this game isn't helping either you or your relationship with your mom. It's one thing if you have to play the game because doing otherwise would mean that you end up living on the street. It's another thing if you continue to play because it's easier than rocking the boat.<br>  <br>  I assume that mom is too gung-ho on her own viewpoint to listen to yours, so I won't ask the obvious question, "Have you talked with her about this?" But it might help to realize that you may eventually be able to use her fixation to your advantage. When you've separated yourself enough, emotionally and financially, and you feel like you have some solid ground to stand on, then you can use your mom's interest in psychologizing you as a way to move the relationship forward. Get her to come to some counseling sessions with you, in which both you and your psychologist tell the TRUTH about your life and your feelings. Use the therapy session as a way to mediate your relationship. <br>  <br>  You know where you're at and what you can handle right now. I really don't, so I don't want to say "You should absolutely do XYZ and do it right away!" This kind of stuff is more easily said than done. So I guess all that I can really say in the end is, have the courage of your convictions, remember it's your life and you're an adult now, and know that you have the ability to change your situation, even if it's just by walking away.<br>  <br>  I absolutely wish you the best of luck with this!

ZC4ZNVzGaa	I heard that if you shave arm hair, then it grows back darker and more coarse. But I think it's the same with your legs. So if you want to shave your arms, I think it's normal, but you just have to keep up with it and start making it a habit of regularly shaving them just like you would with your legs.|`|ZSBkDyAGaa	yeah its fine.<br>  normal.<br>  some ppl like me with alot of frecles on there arms can look a lil funny<br>  but as long as u keep it nice and smoothe u should feel good about em'|`|PRg9UgOlaa	I have been shaving my arms for almost 10 years now, so I don't see a problem with it.

c888be1368c8549a0539963f925c96e7aa	I used Murad, but if you go to Sephora's website they have a really helpful and brief skin profile questionnaire you can run through: <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/section.jhtml?categoryId=C8882" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/section.jh...</a><br>  <br>  After you complete the profile questions, they'll give you a list of products to check out. You should be able to look at the ingredients and see if the products they find for you contain anything to which you're allergic. And if you find one you might like to try -- DON'T buy it from them, lol. I get their emails and they almost NEVER have sales, so try Amazon, or type in the product into Google shop and see where you can find it cheapest. Also talk to a dermatologist and see what they recommend. A good doctor won't force you to use their prescription, but will recommend it along with other options for you. <br>  <br>  For the time being, be cautious and discerning with home remedies. Everyone has different skin types (oily, dry, both, etc) so you'll want to do a little research on your own before deciding on anything. Stay away from the old toothpaste remedy -- that actually will make you break out worse. Keep your hands away from your face, and if you can resist it, don't pop your zits. You usually won't get all of the bacteria out of the pore and it will spread to surrounding pores. Some people have said honey works as a preventative measure. Drink lots of water, and use a nice exfoliator 2-3 times a week. (Just a side note: Make sure to exfoliate your face and neck, otherwise the skin on your neck will look older than on your face). Your diet also has a substantial affect on your skin. So watch what you eat, often times acne is caused by toxins within the body - not just external factors.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, don't be afraid to consult a dermotologist. Besides just treating the symptom (the acne) they can offer you help with fixing what's causing it. Good luck on your search!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Here are some natural remedies. If you have an oily skin wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the pimples like soap.The secret of keeping the skin clear is to keep it oil-free and clean. If you have a dry skin honey is a great remedy for acne and pimples because the honey kills bacteria. If you have a combination skin when you wash your face, use sugar to scrub it, at least once a day, for two weeks to rid yourself of acne.Try  <a href="http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/</a> for more info.|`|CtgBMZewaa	try stuff without benzoyl peroxide...<br>  <br>  try stuff with salicylic acid in it...|`|9aC8u1j1aa	Here is a great article on a ten-year acne sufferer.

WSfpRKIHaa	I had a similar experience.  I was observing a cat's toe being stitched at a vet office.  It was a combination of not having enough to eat or drink that day, the stale air of the clinical environment, the smell of the disinfectant, the bright metal tools, and the lifeless cat.  As i watched the needle going in and out I began to feel light headed so I left to get a drink of water.  Next thing I know I experienced the same sequence of events as you (tho noone caught me, lol) and woke up a few seconds later looking up at some kind vet techs.  They said that sort of thing happens all the time with new students.  It takes a while to get used to the environment.  It isn't necessarily the sight of blood that is the problem, it is combination of things.  <br>  <br>  For you it was probably the stress leading up to the event finally sinking in, and the look of the injection and screaming, and maybe also even the hospital lights and air.  <br>  <br>  Anyway I wouldn't be concerned about your fainting.  I was VERY suprised when I fainted in the vet office. I've never had a problem with blood or needles.  But it happens to a lot of people and is something you would grow used to if you had to deal with every day.    Hope your brother is ok!

Any day, you could have a growth spurt and grow like crazy.<br>  <br>  Has a doctor told you about your high metabolism?

EAT!<br>  4. no no no no no i can garuntee your body works for you and that your gorgeous!<br>  <br>  hopee i helped :)|`|N58YMuuxaa	power up man<br>  Time to go to GMC and buy a shake filled with protein and carbohydrates.  Together with eating Nuts, fruits, and green plants (lettuce, spinach, cabbage, collards, mustard). Look imma make it short GMC has these shakes you have to pick the right one for you, but you have to eat yer fruits, nut and greens. Yes also chicken, eggs, and tuna. Do not get creatine in the shake, it will make you get big, but that water weight only, not real muscles, so if you stop using it it will go away fast.|`|53pargZ3aa	1. Youre very skinny. you should be around 120ish<br>  2. it means that you can eat alot but your body goes through it quick so you dont have alot of fat<br>  3. eat fatty foods?<br>  4. just eat fattier foods i guess. dont be too self conscious!|`|WlFIXJSeaa	no, your fine as long as you are skinny just look at the models! What the public has a problem with is being fat! Dont go anywhere if your fat or you will be laughed at! lol|`|DdJnmx7Laa	look shut up..ur skinny...wanna gain weight??? eat junk food wanna gain muscles?? lift some weights.|`|b9859653bb6be8d4e3a883bd10c27c4caa	1. You are underweight, you should weigh about 110 to 115<br>  2.Your metabolism is what breaks down the food you eat. If you have a high metabolism it means you can eat more food without getting fat.<br>  3. To gain weight and be healthy you need to consume more calories every day from healthy foods and choose the right types of exercise.<br>  4. Well it is common for younger guys to be skinny. Just don't wear clothes that are really big/baggy because this will make you look skinnier. And dont worry about what other people think!!! : )|`|xN0bB8EGaa	Consider yourself lucky to have a high metabolism....one day you will be glad about that part.  A high metabolism is where you burn calories quickly...so it helps you not gain weight.  Since you do want to gain weight I would suggest to try to eat a lot of protein...peanut butter, protein shakes, etc.  Lifting weights would help as well. Lots of younger teens are tall but don't have much muscles..that usually happens later in life --late teens and early twenties.  Your height and weight is in the average range for your age.  Everybody is unique and not like anyone else.  And...don't be scared to go out into public...you are normal!

AA10003191	No. The blockage is on the LOWER side. <br>  <br>  Unless the patient is having consistent symptoms (fatigue with use) in the arm on the lower side, we usually don't do much.|`|SI67vQNuaa	From the internet:<br>  <br>  Blood pressure measurement should be the same in both arms since the heart pumps the blood to all places at the same pressure. It is common for people to have a bit of difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms because we don’t take the blood pressure in both arms at the same time. Blood pressure and heart rate varies with activity and sometimes with anxiety. This is one of the reasons that doctors often take the blood pressure at the beginning and at the end of the examination.<br>  <br>  If your blood pressure is always higher in one arm than the other, this may mean that there is an impediment to flow through the blood vessel that has the lower pressure. It is important for you and your health care provider to know if you do have a difference in blood pressure between your arms, as the blood pressure that is being treated should always be the one taken on the higher side.|`|00fSfCdFaa	Yes
uVMlNvLoaa	Gynecologists are limited to a specific area, so you might want to post your location if you want to get serious answers.<br>  <br>  You'll prolly find better answers on the web rather than yahoo!answers, given that each question ranges about 2-10 answers and the likelihood of one of them being from your area is really slim.<br>  <br>  Good luck, try the yellowpages and reference from friends and family.

15d86cc8d6706b5b214ae1b6a4194dd1aa	do not take anything for the pain. Drugs could interfere with what the doctor will do. plus it could cause damage to the brain (hemorrhaging) could be caused with certain pain relievers. but do not drive or drink anything or eat. get someone to get you to the hospital asap it could be more serious!|`|nwFv7Nwxaa	Well if your typing then I doubt your 'concussion' is to bad.  Anything to bad and you wouldnt be here, even if you have a concussion to begin with.  Good way to tell is if your pupils are different in size!  In order to do that you need someone else there to look at them.<br>  <br>  So lets say you have a mild concussion.  Its okay to sleep as long as you are awaken'd ever couple of hours to see if your still alive and your condition hasnt changed (ie become more confused, lightheaded, sick to your stomach).  If condition changes, you need to see someone to make sure that there is no brain swelling.<br>  <br>  By a couple of hours I mean every two (thats the standard).  You need to be awake and alert and you need to physically move around for a few moments then if no change, go back to sleep.<br>  <br>  You should be better by morning if this is mild and the two hour wakings can cease.  If not better or again, you become worse, a lovely call to your 911 service might be a welcome.  Or a nice family member or friends assistance would be just as welcome.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|A57Qjaszaa	do not go to sleep - you could - in the worse case scenario - never wake up...<br>  if you have a head injury you need to go to hospital... now...<br>  good luck...|`|VAeOb9dfaa	go to the hospital!|`|HQeeHKfZaa	stay awake.  dont drive.  and avoid bright lights.|`|AA11525464	Call 911 and get to the doctor.

dHg78Phdaa	My normal dosage for my Pain is 400mg in the morning 400mg at night. She's going to be fine. Tramadol is a pretty safe alternative to opiates.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  "Best Answer" If you liked it! :)|`|4Quo7TB2aa	She's going to be fine, maybe a little sick to her stomach. If she is up and doing something, it will motivate her. On the other hand, if she is just sitting relaxing then it will relax her more. I took tramadol for 5 years. Trust me on this.|`|IMvg8zajaa	She'll be safe, 4ur, your a lier, 400 mg a day is one pill away from a serotonin overdose|`|hBmafVYoaa	Needs to go to a hospital I think. Seems awfully silly to have taken that much|`|KasFZL7laa	she'll feel very relaxed.  i take tramadol and while it relaxes me, it also makes me kinda peppy.
vNBYAIZLaa	eat healthy food, don't do gymnastics, and make sure you sleep long enough. it's mostly determined by genetics though, but you grow when you sleep, so if you don't sleep enough, that could prevent you from growing.|`|Ad4D3mLEaa	i'm 15 and i am your height, theres not much you can do about it, your genes determine your height, just eat healthy and take care of yourself and wait for a growth spurt :]|`|yN6seKAIaa	I come from a short family too i am 4'8 1/2 im taller then my 15 year old sister.

AA11349803	A "deep cleaning" is not a routine cleaning. It involves going below the gumline to stop a disease of the gums. It is far more involved than just a surface scale and polish to remove plaque.<br>  If you require 4 or more visits to finish your entire mouth (often done in quadrants), the charge is not unreasonable.<br>  Please keep in mind that prices vary widely depending on where you live, just like housing and rent. Downtown Manhattan will cost more than rural South Dakota no matter what you are buying.<br>  If you are concerned about the prices your dentist is charging, get a second opinion.|`|ZEitfScGaa	That seems pretty expensive. I just had  two wisdom teeth out, one was complicated surgery. I think I made four visits to the dentist and the total was $800. When I had to get a crown I think it was $550, and it was a gold crown, so more expensive than the normal plaster or whatever. You are getting ripped.<br>  <br>  Edit: I got the crown put in about 10 years ago, though. So Prices may have gone up.|`|kdSuwt8paa	That sounds appalling.     You should shop around a bit.    That is about what my dentist charges for a crown - but ten times what they charge for cleaning.    What is "deep" cleaning anyway?    I wonder if they are doing a whitening thing without explaining it properly?
dwul5lkPaa	a decent one.. at least 1500 dollars. The good thing is that most of the time, people get what they call "padrinos" aka godfathers for EVERYTHING! This includes, the girls dress, the last doll, the shoes, the crown, the flowers, the mass, etc.<br>  <br>  and btw.. its Quincea?era's|`|7pyIctdCaa	pshhh i wouldnt know.<br>  nobody cared about mine!|`|ny94EXcGaa	No clue..

01Mu3wUeaa	Sounds like a stomach virus.Don't waste your time with the hospital/doctor.<br>  <br>  Don't take an anti diarrheal medication.You have to let your body "flush" naturally.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep rested and hydrated.<br>  <br>  <br>  DON'T go to school...you can spread the virus.<br>  <br>  Wash your hands after EVERY bowel movement.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Take an immodium and get over it.  You're obviously not dying.|`|ZJKmw2nlaa	Go to the hospital. You could be (or be on the way) to becoming dehydrated. You need fluids, possibly through intravenous. You also need to possibly be tested for communicable diseases of the GI tract. So much diarrhea is going to screw with your electrolytes. Go and get checked out, but in the meantime, stick to lots of fluids and a bland diet.|`|Z5vvgPnOaa	Do not take immodium. You have diarrhea for a reason - your body is trying to get rid of an infection that has made its way into your digestive system. If you take something to stop the diarrhea, you could get sicker.<br>  <br>  You really should be seen by a doctor and be drinking gastrolyte to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.|`|QzfHwGOQaa	I think it is something more then Spicy food that is causing it. That is a lot of Diarrhea. <br>  I would talk to your doctor before taking immudiom. Obviously something is trying to get out and it may not be something that can wait.|`|aGYC4UK3aa	Yeah... Go see a doctor man...|`|y56fpdNhaa	You need to drink a lot of fluids to keep yourself hydrated. You need to see a doctor because it may be more serious than you think. good luck.|`|XChkhdBpaa	mate. go to hospital.

Oh and for god's sake, stop eating them.|`|8MQZz17Baa	drink milk. it usually helps subdue other tastes.
gULNGNkFaa	Well you certainly write as if you are anxious. Caffeine can make anxiety worse, so if the doctor diagnosed it as such, cutting back is a good thing. There should be a mental health counselor at your school you can speak to. If the anxiety is interfering with your life as you wrote, it's best to get some help to deal with the symptoms. It's not a sign of weakness to get help, it's actually a sign of strength. College is hard, and a lot of people develop anxiety trying to cope with the stress of it all.<br>  <br>  If however, the pain does not go away, please ask to see a different doctor for a second opinion. I don't want you to ignore a symptom of a possible cardiac issue or perhaps other problem with your stomach etc. Doctors aren't perfect, so trust your instincts if you don't feel any better.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Yeah it does sound like anxiety... you should maybe see a psychologist they show you really good techniques of getting rid of your anxiety.<br>  And yes caffeine is bad for anxiety, instead of tea why don't you try getting like a fuze drink or something?|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I say you do not have anxiety and you are not having a heart attack, I really think you may worry about stupid little things and don't think theres nothing seriously wrong with you, quit worrying so much.......................................|`|Sofk2yO8aa	I've also had those kind of symptoms, and i think i might have an anxiety disorder, so you're probably similar to me that way. If you skipped college cos of that then you're definitely over anxious. Try seredyn, its a natural anxiety reliever, supposedly its pretty good, if that doesnt work then maybe go to the doctor to get something stronger|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	I would lay off the tea for a while and see if it makes the difference. When I cut caffeine completely out of my diet, I ended up getting jumpy and anxious when I actually ingested it. <br>  <br>  Replace the tea with water for a week and see if it makes any difference.|`|AA10185707	Your having panic attacks,ask your doctor about Paxil.|`|j7hxpwTdaa	Im 14 and i get this, and i have anxiety. <br>  it sounds like you do<br>  see a doctor=[|`|a7pJggIeaa	alright dont panic. call a doctor and tell them, but if its a psychological thing i reccommend a psychiatrist. but, its probably anxiety dont worry, is there anything coming up in your life thats new, scary or just thats on your mind? think about those things and try to pull together a logical explaination dont just jump to the worst case scenario|`|Zvu2P2qMaa	that probably is anxiety go to a different doctor go to many and see what they say.|`|Qe7IZGbCaa	i think that it is anxiety . if your feelings are keeping you from your day to day life then its probably serious.|`|DjoMGudYaa	it could be any number of things, talk to the doctor if it doesn't go away withing a week or so|`|ems2NJ46aa	definitely cut down on the caffeine, a strong cup of tea has just as much caffeine in it as a cup of coffee and it's really not good for us.  it will put your body on edge and can create anxiety and panic.  give it a shot for a month without it and see how you get on.  remember caffeine means coke/diet coke/caffinated drinks like red bull/tea/chocolate - so any excesses of these should be cut out.  also cutting down on sugar can be a major help!<br>  <br>  your chest pains, weakness and nausea could possibly have been a blood sugar crash, low blood sugar gives me all those symptoms - i used to think i was crazy, thought i would die from the extreme anxiety, but now i just eat to make sure my blood sugars are kept stable and my life has turned around :)  look up hypoglycemia to learn a bit more about it.  <br>  <br>  taking a vitamin B complex will also help with anxiety.  have a chat with your doctor, give these things a try and hopefully you will start to feel better soon :)|`|yZJUHR3waa	I'm 13 and I have suffered from anxiety my entire life.<br>  It runs in my family so I understood what it was when i was little. I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes with an high pulse, laboured breathing and nausea. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you have it so don't be scared your having a heart attack. <br>  <br>  Over the years of suffering from it I've learnt some tricks to deal with it as well:<br>  <br>  Take deep breaths <br>  Distract yourself by reading or even just talking to someone i find helps - even at 3am, find someone to call :)<br>  If you think the caffeine's a problem, you can always switch to decaf.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help.
sOZoonICaa	i wouldn't put that cream there the Cream is for external use only it also thins the skin drink plenty of cranberry juice and buy natural yogurt and put the yogurt down there it really does work the cranberry juice will flush any bad bacteria away the yogurt will stop the itching.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	No, that medicine is for external use only and could damage the internal vagina.  You need to get some over the counter product like Monistat 7, which is intended to cure yeast infections.  You use it every night immediately before getting into bed for a week and it helps cure the itch and pain.  Do not put yogurt into your vagina, but eating plain, unsweetened yogurt helps restore the balance of good bacteria in your system.  You could also see your doctor for a pill called difflucan which can kick start a cure.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..
jQglJiMhaa	It will strain your eyes and can potentially harm you, and it's a guaranteed headache as well.  You can buy them with just plain lenses with no prescription.  Do that if you want them for Fashion|`|CtgBMZewaa	yes, it will deteriorate your eyes and make them need glasses, and you wont be able to see well...also wearing a prescription if you dont need it will give you headaches and make you see worse...plus, how will you get the prescription from a doc if you dont need it....and dont take anyone elses, becasue it is not right prescription and will screw up your eyes.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	yes its bad to wear glasses with a power- you can instead get glasses with non-prescription or plano lenses put in and wear them for fashion.|`|zCHnMeXbaa	If you are talking about prescription lens glasses the answer is yes.

W5U0PyNeaa	I've same problem too.  It must come with people who used to be obese.  That loved ones around you worry that you MIGHT BE heading toward "too skinny unhealthy body image".<br>  <br>  I'm 154cm and used to be 73kg. Now I'm 52kg and aiming for 48kg.  <br>  <br>  Every time I see mum now she says "you don't need to lose anymore weight... or you won't look sexy in a bikini"<br>  <br>  But I know so many "hot" & healthy girls who weigh less than me! (proportioned to their height)  <br>  <br>  It almost feel like I'm not allowed to be "hot" but be happy with being "OK" or average.<br>  <br>  I'm aiming to be fit and toned, not average.  <br>  <br>  So as long as I'm eating healthy and exercising, I can just ignore the criticisms.  There's nothing wrong with aiming high... there's difference between wanting to look like emaciated super model, and fit and toned flab-free good looking person.<br>  <br>  If a person can't tell the difference by how you are living, then that person is just plain ignorant.<br>  <br>  Just concentrate on being good enough for yourself, and don't worry about others because it's most likely they don't really know how much effort you are putting in.|`|f2XhfAoIaa	People don't really understand how hard it is for people who are overweight to lose the weight and they just think once you've lost it that they need to make other compliments to make you feel better. I've lost fifty pounds in a year and my mom keeps telling me that I'm probably around my appropriate weight and that I look really skinny, but I am 5'9 and 172lbs which is nothing close to what I want to be (I want to get to 140lbs) and it just bothers me that she doesn't want to support me losing even more weight.. It is hard..|`|AA10289917	Those comments are meant well.  Just consider it as their only way to say they care about you.  Don't take it like they are never satisfied.  If it really gets to you, say to them in a kind way that you are taking care of yourself and when you need their advice you will consult them.    Tell them your doctor says you are fine.  Remember, they never felt your hurt.  Lift your head and put them behind you.  Keep on with your weight loss.  You are a winner!!|`|i2jNoGIKaa	I know exactly how you feel. I was a heavy kid, changed my diet, but then became anorexic/bulimic...My family started saying the same things. <br>  try eating:<br>  kashi products<br>  fruits and veggies<br>  low fat dairy|`|rh5vbol9aa	Why do not visit the website of REAL AGE?|`|N2syOdkGaa	They feel uncomfortable about how they are or how they look so they see someone with even a small defect and they make fun of people that they actually look up to. Just tell them if tha's how they feel about it so be it but it is what you want and think that matters the most. I think that your weight is perfectly acceptable but if you want to lose more then do but consult a doctor about what is the best weight for you. The proper weight is also determined by sumatotype and not just height.|`|boUUnTjnaa	I understand how you feel i always got told i was too fat and now ive lost the weight im supposidly too thin , i think theyre just adjusting to the new thinner you , Well done for the weight loss <br>  And it's how you feel about yourself If your happy with yourself then thats what matters x|`|bdaqf5fmaa	you're perfect right now. the bmi for healthy 5'7 people is between 18.5 - 24.9. you are right in the middle (21.9)  bmi isn't always correct, yet it is a pretty good guideline.<br>  you'll be fine! they're just getting used to you.|`|QRCQJF6Faa	I know it is hard but try and not let others people insecurities affect how you feel, they are clearly not happy with themselves and probably jealous that you lost the weight so easily, just ignore them.<br>  <br>  And congrats on losing the weight and I am sure in time you will lose the other 5 or 10 lbs, it can be hard sometimes to lose that last bit of weight but keep doing what you have been doing and it will go in time.<br>  <br>  Again, the main thing here is not to let other people control how you feel, this is a life lesson that will go along way in the years to come. Trust me, you can't please all of the people all of the time, and sometimes you can't please anyone any of time but again, this is THEIR problem, not yours.<br>  <br>  I do hope that helps and wish you the best in losing the last few pounds, great job!<br>  <br>  Adam-O|`|6lmFyr2maa	well done you!!! it takes a lot of hard work to loose weight but your body will really benefit from it!!<br>  <br>  as for the comments im sure its just your family looking out for you, just explain to them how you feel and you'll find they'll be more supportive, they clearly dont see it from your point of view but once they get used to the new you they'll be ok.<br>  <br>  and remember as long as your happy within yourself thats all that matters =]<br>  <br>  xxx
ooJ3JMDwaa	one time i had heat rash and my mom made me put it on <br>  IT HURT LIKE A B*TCH!!! i say stick w. normal baby powder... less painful|`|cfcuBxdsaa	yes and the powder is good for rashes however if you have been scratching the rash and left  it open to heal the powder will sting
Ibx7MDmBaa	The same thing happened to me! This is what it was, I hurt myself in basketball, couldn't do anything because it was hard to move and it hurt so bad (thats when we discovered I had scoliosis) and it turned out that my injury wasn't causeing the pain, the scoliosis was and it had come on so fast and was so severe that my musceles were moving. I'm not saying the same thing is happening to you, but maybe your mom or dad could check your back as you do the Adam's Forward Bend Test (Take off your shirt, touch your toes without bending your legs) They should look for a curve in the spine or uneveness in your back. If it looks different, call the doc. If it looks the same, maybe try a visit to the chiropractor!|`|gmefdkZsaa	hmmm, well you could rub some Bengay on it, and take a pain reliever, if it has been like more than 2 weeks<br>  <br>   go to the doctor to make sure nothing is serious,<br>  <br>  and give your back some rest...<br>  hope this helps!!!<br>  good luck <br>  -?
TORBP6QIaa	OK...many things here make a difference in the outcome.  Firstly when he had the arrest in the hospital  and was defibrillated within a couple of minutes minutes his chances of full recovery are the best they can be.  <br>  If it took longer thats not so good...if someone gave him CPR until the Ambulance arrived that is good.  <br>  If he was out for over 5 minutes and nearer to 10 minutes but they brught him back he may well have suffered brain damage.<br>  They like to put these patients in medically induced comas and cool them down for a period of time to allow their body time to rest and heal before waking them up.  This gives the best outcomes and is possibly why they cannot give you any answers yet as to his chances.<br>  Time is what it takes to know if a patient is going to recover from a cardiac arrest.

If he continues, just be honest with him and tell him that you are not interested.|`|nbuQ8OUsaa	you should talk to him about how you feel. say its rather uncomfortable being complimented in that way. try to be serious or he'll think you're just kidding and carry on. any decent guy would stop if asked but if he continues then call the police and report him for harassment :p <br>  <br>  if you're not really a friend of his then ignore him. he'll sooner or later lose interest.|`|VUOryYp6aa	Well, when he says that just make a sarcastic kind of face and try to give him a hint. (fake smile) If he doesn't take the hint, just tell him the truth. AND if he STILL doesn't get it, karate chop him in the throat and tell him to piss off.|`|qqLcvDDKaa	Just tell him don't ever call you that again, or you can just ignore him.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Smile and say thanks cuddle pot.|`|jefqyQ9Daa	Well, if he's talking to u like that, he's likly doing it to look good infront of his friends, don't bother with him, but if u ask me, ur most likly asking this question because u want to reply, so reply, I take of u do like him|`|4lqQzcwqaa	try to talk him, spents some moments with him carefully, try to get him attitudes, moral character,etc. and get him introduce with family, friends.<br>  try to search out many information about him.<br>  finally, you decide what's to do?
00fSfCdFaa	Yes you have lymph nodes in a lot of places including small ones in the backs of the knees. However the main ones are in the neck, armpit and groin areas. <br>  <br>  Below is a link to a picture of the lymphatic system. It's basic purpose is to drain extracellular 'plasma-like' fluid back into the heart to rejoin the blood circulation. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sportron.info/english/health_issues/images/lymphatic_system.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportron.info/english/health_...</a>|`|U4V6TkZEaa	I thought that "nods" were for your head.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	yes,we have them and dogs/cats too!<br>  i think you can check them on google/yahoo under this:popliteal lymph nodes<br>  i had mono a few years ago:these were swollen also,in the groin,armpits too!|`|mS1ODTalaa	yes. they are mostly concentrted in your neck and under your armpits|`|tBq6ZDZvaa	I hope not
uJPcq36Daa	I don't know any other types of ways but I am on a pill called seasonal and i get my period every three months now. thats the only thing I know of that might work for you . i would just ask a doctor what else there is for you.|`|IJPsYzzQaa	You might consider the patch. I couldn't take the pill because I never remembered to take it. It does not stop your periods but it did make mine A LOT lighter and shorter which was fine for me. You only have to remember to change it once a week, its pretty nice!|`|PImvmP1paa	You can take regular combination birth control pills. <br>  <br>  To help you remember, you can set a reminder on your cell phone. <br>  <br>  Combination pills help to keep you from ovulating. <br>  <br>  You can also use condoms if you don't want to have anymore kids.
AA10450066	Of course, but a low grade temperature can mean allot of things.If you have no other symptoms of anything else it just means that your body's immune system is fighting the cold.Drink plenty of water and take some tylenol or whatever you use for this and you should be fine in a couple of days. A few extra hours sleep helps too.|`|Z5vvgPnOaa	Yes you can get a fever when you have a cold. If it is just a cold, the fever should not really go on for more than 3 to 4 days.|`|y56fpdNhaa	yes some colds cause fevers. But a fever is 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. good luck|`|CJkZpWv0aa	hi
xfgVGqvXaa	I don't know about that product specifically, but virtually all perfumes contain ingredients that have been tested on animals.  A lot of animal testing was done in the past, and many of the ingredients which were tested then are still in use.  There is no way to 'untest' something!
OKrJrDF1aa	Exact Same.Haven't had it for 2 months. Don't worry. For the first few years, your period is a bit abnormal, just like me! ^_^|`|QJHE3z1raa	VERYYYY normal|`|S7Q3fRvoaa	That's totally normal, it happens to everyone.  Your period just takes some time to become regular, but for now, just make sure you carry an extra pad or tampon with you since you never know when ur gonna get it|`|0FSBiLQVaa	You see, when you first get your period, it is normal to have irregular periods. It is because your body is still getting used to the monthly cycle. This only lasts for about a year, give or take.|`|a3bq277Gaa	Your period will be kinda whacked out for the first few years.<br>  <br>  It's very normal! :)

Do whatever you can to make it feel better, stay off of it, tape it, whatever.  It will heal by itself in a few weeks.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	The most they'll probably do is give you a surgical shoe--of you cant wear regular shoes
lcuxD3qlaa	Good for you!<br>  <br>  ~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~**~*<br>  <br>  I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k?<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!? (Kosher aisle)<br>  Mott’s applesauce, no added sugar is one of my favorite things to eat too!<br>  You can find organic applesauce too which provide different flavors without added sugar<br>  All “no added sugar” products are phenomenal<br>  <br>  NOTE: BEEF, Oh my god -it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...it’s the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice is great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soups (especially the ones with very little sodium)<br>  <br>  Fruit is ALWAYS a great snack at night!<br>  <br>  Ok, that’s all I can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  (I know I went on a rampage here, but I honestly hope this helps!)<br>  <br>  xoxoxox|`|jM67YMfMaa	Its probably because you're not used to it, or you're not hungry, just thirsty. Try drinking more water esp. with a meal. You'll find it fills you more. It also is VERY hard to completely change your habits in one step, so its easier to incorporate healthier things step by step into your diet. That way is easier to adapt to and you won't even miss the junk food.|`|a53fdb2ccb52feb6c0428410b79814e2aa	Eat some meat along with the healthy stuff. Cuz theirs a healthy recommended daily amount of meat that you should eat as well.|`|AA10064810	Check out the South Beach diet book (library).  You probably are hooked on sugar and other carbohydrates and are used to eating until you feel stuffed instead of waiting about 5 minutes after eating to see if you need to eat more.  Also, there is the psychological aspect.  You know you are denying yourself and you are mourning all those great tasting foods.  <br>  <br>  Try eating a big breakfast.  Then, break up your eating into 5 small meals a day and see if that helps you get through.<br>  <br>  We all sympathize with you because this is normal and we've been there, too.
arrtdo93aa	I thinkk you'll be fine..it was only a few pills.<br>  <br>  <br>  I was on the pill for about 7 years and didnt take it at the same time every day and DID have unprotected sex with my boyfriend and it was still effective.<br>  <br>  So i'm pretty sure that you'll be fine. Maybe some spotting but that about it|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	No, you should be fine.  They recommend taking them at the same time to keep the hormones evenly in your system, but a couple of hours won't really make much difference.  <br>  <br>  best wishes..

In the good case they mean that your hair looks healthy. And in the bad case they mean it's greasy and slimy. But most of the time it's good because shiny hair ( the good one )  looks cool. Don't sweat the comments, Just make sure that you wash your hair at LEAST 3 times a week. Hope I've Helped!|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	Either it was a good thing and means your/the guy she was talking about hair is really well conditioned and looks nice to touch....<br>  <br>  OR she meant you have far too much gel in and it's making it shiny|`|cd0b3bbd8df141c2851cdda176199d30aa	By shiny hair I'm assuming healthy hair.<br>  So.. the answer to your question is yes.(as long as u have some personality to add to this hair)<br>  I mean who doesn't love a healthy head of hair?<br>  <br>  :)|`|v30TPwUtaa	Healthy hair is loved by everyone.<br>  Who wants to run their hands through flaky dry hair?|`|6GWctkQzaa	Yeah.

It more implicitly suggests a touch of envy, and if she were a closer acquaintance, might provoke a polite inquisition into your preferred brand of shampoo/conditioner, nothing more. <br>  <br>  Your hopes of imminent coitus are so far, scuppered.|`|RNJ0NRTTaa	Shiny hair is nicer than greasy hair.But no, I wouldn't say that shiny hair increases a males chance on initiating a long term realtionship.I have to sayI loved the way you articulate yourself.That increases males chances for me.|`|fK18ewGuaa	Well, you see, lustrous hair is very quite good indeed to have. So in my opinion, this comment you over-heard while galavanting about is a good comment to get indeed!

Fo9ADQLBaa	I have had two abortions.  What the first one did not do to me, the second one did.  I will spend the rest of my life trying to forgive myself!|`|mSFjbetxaa	No, it would have no influence.  What I did in the past was what I had to do in my mind.  <br>  <br>  I do not believe that most women take the steps to terminate a pregnancy lightly.  These women have reasons that make sense to them.|`|sOZoonICaa	i have not had an abortion but i feel if you are practising safe sex then you should take the morning after pill i.e if the condom split or if you missed the pill abortion is something that ive never had to consider but im not a person who will judge to say who is right or who is wrong every body's circumstances are different.|`|VJCyQWRzaa	i am all for abortion i think it should be completly up 2 mum to have the child for anyreason its her life she will fuin ... have as manny as she wants i think.|`|WYlHY8jQaa	I have never had one but i would think if someone had one b4 they should practice safe sex so they dont have to put themselves in that position again.One is to many.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	Having had an abortion in the past, I think I'd stick with the veal.|`|AA12379997	I have a friend who has had a few abortions.  I think having one successful abortion with no complications definitely influenced her to have another one when she because pregnant again and was not in a good situation to have the baby.  She had 3 and then finally the fourth time she had the baby.  But did get pregnant again after her child was born and had a 4th abortion.  She would probably do it again if it happened again.  I myself have never had an abortion and dont think I would.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wshK3zaWaa	I really think it depends on each woman individually and where her mind is at. I have had an abortion in the past just once and I was totally devasted afterwards, but at the time I felt it was best for my situation. I would  never do it again, but that is just me personally. Do I place judgement on others for her choice, "no". I do think that one who has a conscience would ponder hard on the situation and weigh all of the options before making the decision. Abortions are not a form of birth control, but an option when faced with a difficult situation.

WYlHY8jQaa	Wearing bras to bed could cause breast cysts, pain, and cancer. It has to do with the constrictive nature of bras. Compression and constriction of the breast tissue by bras prevents the lymphatic system from cleansing the breast tissue of toxins. These toxins (some of which cause cancer) enter our bodies from our petrochemically polluted world, in our water, food, and air, and they course throughout our bodies and need to be flushed out of the tissue by the lymphatic system. Wearing a bra prevents this cleansing process, and causes the fluid in the tissue to back-up, resulting in lymph edema and associated pressure, pain, cysts, and, ultimately, cancer.<br>  <br>  If your bra leaves red marks or indentation, then it is too tight. The longer a bra is worn, the more damage is done to the breast tissue. A study done on over 4700 US women found that women who wear their bras to bed, which means 24/7 of bra wearing, have a 75% chance of developing breast cancer. Conversely, bra-free women have the same low rates of breast cancer as men.<br>  <br>  Bras should be worn as loosely as possible, certainly less than 12 hours daily, and never to bed. For more on this, see the book, Dressed To Kill: The Link Between Breast Cancer and Bras, by medical anthropologists Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer. You can also visit the authors' website at www.SelfStudyCenter.org.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to try an experiment on yourself. Stop wearing a bra for a few weeks and see how you feel afterwards. Most women find that their breast pain and cysts go away. And it will help you prevent breast cancer, too.|`|PImvmP1paa	You shouldn't wear bras to bed at all. It gives them a rest. And you won't start to sag if you don't wear a bra for 8 hours. <br>  <br>  You start to sag after you have children, when you lose a lot of weight (you lose it in your breasts too), with age, and when you don't wear a bra for like years in a row.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	If you haven't grown much you do not need a bra, certainly not to sleep in!<br>  It is healthier not to wear a bra to sleep, but later if you need one get a soft sport support bra, without any wire shaping, at least one size too big!|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Do no such thing. What women are worried about are underwire bras and cancer. <br>  You have a long time to worry about sag. When you decide to have children - then you can think about it.|`|Vz6eu8oCaa	Quite frankly, there haven't been enough studies done to say definitely whether or not wearing a bra to sleep causes cancer. <br>  <br>  You really shouldn't worry too much about it until more research is done, unless you plan to give up bras altogether.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't wear bras, there will always be a risk of cysts, pain, cancer and other things.<br>  Honestly, as long as your bra fits correctly you shouldn't be too worried.<br>  <br>  As for sagging, that's completely natural and, besides from surgery, there's no way around it.  You won't have to worry about it until you hit menopause or have children.<br>  <br>  Point: Do whatever makes you comfortable.|`|w4qneMVraa	It definitely does NOT cause breast cancer.  It is uncomfortable, though, to wear a bra to bed.  As far as it making your "boobs saggy," think about it this way-- gravity pulls them down when you're standing up, but when you're laying down, gravity doesn't have the same effects.  Not wearing a bra to bed will not make you sag, it'll just save you some discomfort.|`|4BSxM9B8aa	just to be safe i would not wear a bra to bed i dont, it is just more comfortable too|`|hBmafVYoaa	Absolutely cannot cause breast cancer. It's best not to, but not for cancer reasons|`|AA11185479	Wearing a bra does NOT cause cancer, in bed or out of it.  This hysteria was caused by one poorly-researched study.  The evidence is circumstantial, not direct.  Check snopes.com before you believe the rumors.<br>  <br>  No, your breasts won't sag if you don't wear a bra to bed.  Think about it - you're lying on your back most of the time, so gravity pulls your breasts flat to your chest, not down towards your toes.  <br>  <br>  Eventually, as you grow older, your breasts will start a slow and inevitable slide downwards - it's natural and there isn't anything that can prevent/reverse it except surgery.  Don't worry, you'll still be nice and perky for the next 10-15 years at least, and you won't really start to sag until after you breastfeed your children.

7uSSJPMKaa	Cold sores are caused by the Herpes virus.  You don't get them instead of being sick--you often get them when you are sick or coming down with something that makes you susceptable to an infection.  The best way to get rid of it is to leave it alone!  Do not touch it.  Do not try to dry it out with alcohol or anything else.  A cold sore oozes and if you dry it out it will scab, re-ooze, scab etc etc.  Put a dab of vaseline, clear lip moisturizer on it.  You can buy Zovirax ointment but it costs a fortune with very little effect beyond vaseline.|`|CtgBMZewaa	not true....its a skin virus...ever heard of herpes?  this is above the waist herpes...<br>  <a href="http://www.animated-teeth.com/cold_sores/t1_cold_sores.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animated-teeth.com/cold_sores...</a><br>  <br>  and this is what i use to get rid of them!<br>  <a href="http://www.herpecinl.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpecinl.com/</a><br>  <br>  or caramex, or other cold sore treatment in your local pharmacy!  like nivea, abreva, etc...<br>  <br>  it will specifically say cold sore treatment on the box, no worries...<br>  <br>  you get cold sores when your immune system is down and the virus attacks, cold sores are contagious with contact...but you wouldn't get sick from them...its just a skin disease...<br>  <br>  some home remedies:<br>  <a href="http://www.mothernature.com/Library/Bookshelf/Books/47/34.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothernature.com/Library/Book...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_en-USUS300US303&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=at+home+remedies+cold+sore" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGLS...</a><br>  <br>  good luck...|`|DIxbib1paa	Boil the kettle, put hot water in a mug, stir in a load of salt, you have now got boiling hot salt water, get a q-tip/cotton bud and dip it in the water, now for the painful bit, hold the q-tip/cotton bud on cold saw then repeat a few times, make sure you dont use one end twice!

gPeEdjmuaa	Honestly, braces aren't even a big deal anymore! Pretty much everyone has/had to get them. If I were you, I think I would get them done my senior year to get it over with. That's one less year you have to worry about. The sooner the better, in my opinion. I wouldn't worry about prom and graduation, if you feel uncomfortable with taking pictures you can always smile with your lips closed together. You won't even be able to tell. If you do choose to wait until your freshman year of college, then that would be fine, too. A lot of people get braces at any age. I know a 60 year old who just got them! You're never to old to get your teeth repaired. In the end, you will be thankful you got them. Not as many college students get them as you would see in high school, because most kids get theirs in middle school, but you will see a good sized amount. In many cases, the people who do have them probably had to get them again because they didn't take care of them properly or they needed a second round when their teeth matured.|`|IKakoOfyaa	I agree with Gabriella....the sooner the better.  That way, you're going to be used to them and not have to hassle with it when you start college.  You'll have enough changes to deal with then.<br>  <br>  I see people of all ages wearing braces.  I wore them from 8th grade to the end of junior year in high school and when I was in high school, my art teacher had them.|`|AA10784260	wait til college|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It's weird for a 30 year old to have braces, right now 2 years doesn't matter.

qrGLcTh4aa	Dental implants are the only replacement I would recommend. The only 2 problems are that <br>  A: No they won't place an implant while you still have braces. Your teeth are shifting and changing. You'll be great candidate when your braces come off.<br>  B: You're too young. You're still growing and no Periodontist will do an implant on anyone under 18.<br>  <br>  But in a few years when you're 18 and your braces are off they will be a great option for you. You won't regret it.|`|l5IjG90oaa	dental implants are basically artificial substitutes / replacements for missing teeth. they look 100% like real teeth, noone will be able to tell that it isn't a natural tooth, as cosmetic dentistry is unreal these days. you will experience little pain, if any, which will be more likely to occur afterwards. dental implants are no big deal, the only downside is the cost. they cost around ￡800 each, at least. that's if your dentist does give you it on the NHS. best wishes x

I have researched it.  In some cases 21, or 25, if public funding is used (not a law).  The rest is up to how liberal the doctor is.  If a man gets refused, he should just call the next doctor in the yellow pages.  Non-profit places that use private funding are more liberal than those who use public funding.  It is not a matter of law, it is a matter of the brand of ethics of the staff at the clinic, the doctor, and the funding source.<br>  <br>  From time to time a clinic may have its own rules due to liability.  Sometimes a young man or his family will try to sue the clinic if he gets a vasectomy and has no male children.

Y0r69m4zaa	Just eating food won't necessarily cause your blood sugar to go up.<br>  <br>  It depends on what you eat and how much you eat.<br>  <br>  For example, complexed carbohydrates like rice, pasta, bread, and potatoes almost instantly raise your blood sugar after you eat them.  However, you still need a little bit in your diet or you will be tired all the time.<br>  <br>  I have found a website that talks about food choice among other things to help you understand how to better take care of yourself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|jlzdQSmzaa	It all depends on how high it is, even after you have eaten a non-diabetic persons sugars don't go very high just a little.

Also look into reducing your stress, maybe that will help! Good luck.

You can live a full and happy life while celibate. <br>  <br>  Now that that's aside, if you're feeling depressed, the best thing to do is to talk to a professional about it.

SI67vQNuaa	I would suggest that you wash your hands really really good and then with clean hands, cup some lukewarm water and try to gently flush your eye out with the water.

VEYBxej2aa	Do you know what grades your uni uses to correspond to percentages? Most UK unis use roughly the same sort of scale, where anything above 70% is an A [or a first], 60% plus is a B [or a 2.1], 50% plus is a C [or a 2.2] and so on. This is very different from the way things are graded in school, where the percentages to get all grades were much higher. So if you're looking just at percentages, it can look like your grades have dropped a lot, which can make you feel as though you've somehow become worse. You haven't, it's just the scheme.<br>  <br>  Also, humanities are always going to give lower marks than science subjects because they're subjective. With science it's just right or wrong answers. With humanities and essay writing, it could depend on what mood the marker is in, how different your work is from eighty other people's, whether they understand your writing style and so on. Humanities subjects are, I would argue, a lot harder to get higher grades in, and that's probably why the percentages are set so low.<br>  <br>  I get where you're coming from because I felt the same way for a while after my first few pieces of work, having been used to getting As and high marks without that much effort. But I do know that although comparing myself to others isn't worthwhile, I am still getting higher marks than most others. [The actual comparison isn't the point, the point is that their average maks have dropped a lot as well, so it's not just me.]<br>  <br>  To get anything in the 70s by the way is an amazing achievement. There are generally only a handful of firsts given out at most universities and to be in the running for that, which you most certainly are, means you're doing damn well.|`|l5s7x31Laa	It doesn't matter how smart you think you are.

tL6sSR6Waa	1st off, as for the those people that say you are emo or that you should just "get over it" and stuff obviously don't know what they are talking about, at all. Please don't listen to them, they are just ignorant. <br>  <br>  2nd, for someone that worked with juvenile teens, I was disappointed in what that one guy said. Most cutters are NOT cutting for attention, that's a huge misconception. It may appear that way because those that do cut for attention (which there are some) want attention, so they will make it known. Whereas "real" cutters (such as yourself and myself) don't show it off, but hide it. So, it may seem most cut for attention, but that's far from the truth. <br>  <br>  If you want to stop, you should get help. Either from your mom or trusted teacher or religious leader, or something. Cutting is extremely hard to quit, especially if you have already gotten caught up in it, and near to impossible to do on your own. You need all the love and support you can get. <br>  <br>  Do you think that your mom will listen to you? Not call you a drama queen? If you have been able to tell your mom everything up to this point, then it sounds like she would be able to hear you out on this. Like the others said, she will likely be upset, but that's because it's hard to hear that your daughter is hurting herself. Some parents are relatively cool though.<br>  <br>   I'm just wondering cause it's a sad fact but it's definitely not uncommon for parents of cutters to freak out and think their kids are "drama queens" or exaggerating, or stuff like that. My parents didn't react well when I told them. They didn't get mad, but my mom just went on about how I was destroying my "temple" (religious thing) and didn't really take it as seriously as she should have (she said my cuts were only superficial, and that I was only mildly depressed). I'm not trying to discourage, but let you know that sometimes it happens. Often cutting stems from an environment of invalidation (basically saying your emotions are wrong or unimportant or incorrect), and the reactions of parents can reinforce this.<br>  <br>   I'm not trying to get you from not telling your parent(s) if you think it will help. I'm just letting you know there is a chance. But, there are tons and tons of people that tell their parents and they are sad but supportive and help get their kids help and such. So, if you think that she will help, you should tell her. You should definitely tell her. You need help in some way or another, and you can't get it alone. It won't be easy, but it will be better to look back at this point of your life in a few years, than to still be living it (believe me). <br>  <br>  If you are looking for info about cutting, how to tell your parents, tips on stopping, and a support base check out recoveryourlife.com.  it's an excellent site, gives you a lot of good info, and it's got a forum and chats for those trying to quit or those who just need help. Also, if you want to chat or ask questions or swap stories/info, feel free to contact me at personal.sicifant@yahoo.com.  I've been cutting for 5 years, so I've got some experience with it ^^ Anyway, I hope something works for you. Take care!|`|de8xL7D9aa	Most girls cut for attention. However some really do feel the need to see the blood run out of your veins to know your alive or you would rather have pain on the outside then on the inside. You need to stop either way before it really becomes addicting, if you are doing it for the attention you need to find a different way to get it. If you are doing it because you really feel the need to you need to tell your mom and she needs to get you help. You need to get psychiatric help because you clearly have a problem that is not healthy. Who wants to see some one with scars all over them from cutting? Plus you will get infections and could end up committing suicide, So tell your mom or get help somewhere else. Just stop cutting.|`|ho73OV9Uaa	at the moment its your coping mechanism and its actually something that is normally very hard to stop... even if you stop now, you may resort to it again later in the future. i would definitely talk to your mom or someone about it. it's extremely serious and you need to get to the root of what's causing you to cut. some people go to rehab for cutting cause it gets so out of control...make sure you address the problem as soon as possible hun!|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	Self-injury is a problem, and you need to stop one way or the other.

Plenty of "preppy girls" cut themselves. In my opinion, you need help. Therapy, doctors, etc. I know you don't want to hear it. I'm a teen and I would not like to hear it either. But cutting is a seriously big deal. If your mom is anything like mine she will be very supportive and not call you something like a "drama queen but realize you have a  problem and get you the help you need. I know how much life sucks but try to find other ways to deal. like painting (even if you're not good at it) . that really helped me deal with some serious stuff.

dpgXzMenaa	The "not feeling good" that many girls feel the first time with a tampon is a nauseous and trembly feelilng, sometimes a little dizzy or even faint (it's called a "vaso-vagal reaction") - and if that's what you're feeling, it's a response to fear or anxiety about putting something inside your body.<br>  <br>  There's actually nothing to fear.<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|OiKHTpgAaa	hi im 13 and i started when i was 11, i tried to use a tampon wen i was 12 and succeeded buty i felt realy dizzy and weird, what u have to do is wear a pad, make sue you are on your pedriod wen u try and make sure the tampon is out!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  but nothing to worry about ull be fine!!!|`|YW6pLkDvaa	the first time i used a tampon i almost through up<br>  why? i have no idea<br>  just take it out and try again another day<br>  thats what i did and now i can use them fine<br>  you might of just put it in a weird position idk|`|xN0bB8EGaa	Maybe since you are not used to them you got worried...which would be perfectly normal.

Next time you are thinking about buying one, why not try it out first by joing in on ole Rex's stuffed animal when he is humping it. Either way, you need to get real.

Go to your local drugstore such as CVS and you should be able to find a small tube there.  do not try to pop it if it's not mature, it will only make things worst.  Always use toner/astringent afterwards when dealing with pores on your face.  you do not want to have large pores in the future.|`|11vkZiVsaa	Get a hot face cloth and leave it on for a few mins to open up your pores. This will also bring all the nastiness that's in your skin up to the surface so you can pop it. When you pop it make sure you stop after all the white is out and stop before you squeeze blood out.

nAp688tZaa	Sounds like some sort of compression on a nerve.  It could be coming from either your elbow, or neck.  There are nerve roots in your neck that come out and run down your upper body to areas like the hands and shoulder.  If you have nerve root compression in the lower neck (c6,c7,c8) then you would have these sensations.  If it is not your neck, it could be nerve compression in your elbow, which is called Ulnar Neuropathy.  Depending on the level of pain or discomfort a doctor would suggest either physical therapy, a nerve drug like Neurontin, or surgery. The only sure proof way to diagnose these is through an MRI and Nerve Conduction Test.  The MRI will show if there are any nerve roots being compressed in your neck and the Nerve Conduction test would be done to see if there is a compressed nerve in the elbow.  You need to ask your family doctor for an MRI and referral to a neurologist.  Good Luck|`|m1Kjxlkvaa	this sounds like trapped nerve, I had this really bad a few years back, it can come back now and again, I find if I try to lift heavy things it feels tingly and my hands become numb, so I  have to be careful, pain killers is what to use, but if pain bad in shoulder, put cold compress on it, not hot as it irritates the nerves and makes it worse,hope this helps, it will take time to settle,but if your careful it will, but be careful in future what you lift

iwBJ9ij5aa	In some cases, yes, people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder can outgrow their symptoms. It is a disorder caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, and there is always a possibility that your body's chemical make up can change.<br>  <br>  The majority of people with Bipolar Disorder will not outgrow it. Many people experience "episodes" or periods in their life where their symptoms are more active than others. The best way to overcome those times is to learn positive thinking patterns to help get you through the hard times. Attending DBT, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, can help you learn how to control your thoughts and help yourself through episodes.<br>  <br>  Some people find that therapy is not enough, in which case you might want to consider talking with your doctor or therapist about taking some medication.|`|AWSmknxLaa	No, never.

Then some thing's happened and changed in my life and I decided I didn't want to let this disorder control my life anymore.

But every girl is different and your cycle may vary from a 22 day cycle to a 35 day cycle. But it's not likely you will start your period for the trip.

IMPvzBk1aa	A canker sore is an ulcer on the oral tissue, and is acutely painful.  This is not an ulcer, but is a swelling which may be caused by a number of things including infection, as in an abscess, or an irritation or inflammation not associated with infection. However, an abscess typically is not visible until it is already very painful.  It can be a hypersensitivity response to your toothpaste, or even be a fluid collection or  hematoma following a bang with your toothbrush. It will either progress and become painful, or it will resolve eventually on its own.  If it doesn't resolve, or becomes painful, see your dentist.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	A canker sore inside the mouth is an shallow open sore, not a lump.   They usually happen because of some sort of injury to the gum, although they can also happen due to irritation from a food of some sort.  A piece of trapped popcorn at the gum line, eating a lot of hot peppers, citrus fruit, tomatos or other high acid food can also do the trick.  In this case, if your dental work was done recently it is possible that the gum was injured or the filling itself may be leaking.  The best thing would be to visit the dentist and have it checked.  If it is a canker sore, the dentist can provide you with an antimicrobial mouth rinse that can help encourage healing and also help with the discomfort.  If it is an abscess, then the dentist can also find and treat the reason, and allow you to save the tooth from further damage.  There are ways to tell which it is, but given the location it may be difficult and the dentist is the best person to have make the call.  Given your description, I think it is most likely an abscess, so you will want to see your dentist as soon as you can arrange that.|`|f890d82e3b2cb1a15aa475ff75321c1aaa	Try looking at the best answer for the question it says I referenced :]

Run, jog, sprint, jumping jacks, elliptical, anything that gets your heart rate. Also, eat healthy foods and don't eat too much.

You can work the muscles in each area you would like to improve.  You body loses weight from different places as you start to lose weight, so it is hard to say where you will see results first.

That is not a good breakfast for a girl your age who is not fat.     <br>  <br>  OK - this is absolutely the simplest and really works.<br>  Breakfast - a portion of cereal with either a tub of light yoghurt or a banana and a glass of milk<br>  Mid morning. Piece of fruit.<br>  Lunch. Either tuna or cold meat and salad sandwich. (Or salad in a container if you prefer that.)<br>  Mid afternoon. Piece of fruit. Dry crackers.  Glass of milk.<br>  Evening meal, whatever the family is having but no rich sauces. No dessert.   Tortillas are fine.<br>  No cheese, chocolate, sodas or junk food.<br>  20 minute walk every day - trying to go a bit further (faster) each day.<br>   A good glass of water with each meal or snack. Eating like this (normally) is much better than a diet because you can keep it up indefinitely and it won't bug your mum! You will notice a difference quite quickly.   When the weather is not quite so hot you need to have a 20 min brisk walk on the days you don't play sport.<br>  You will just have to be strong about not eating the junk food.|`|i2jNoGIKaa	geez, you might be developing an eating disorder.... <br>  don't depribe yourdelf of those chocolates.

gfmTgLDKaa	Sit ups- Really bad, honestly do zero. Sit ups help your back not your abs. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is:<br>  1) Crunches, go 45 degree angle only, and make sure you feel your abs pulling and contracting every time!<br>  2) Planks- Go to push up position, and put your elbows and forearms to the ground in a plank like look, and stay as long as you can. Try to beat your previous time every time you do this. That's how you improve.<br>  3) Lift, lay down and get your legs six inches off the ground and hold as long as you can. When you can't do anymore, lift up your leg with out bending as near to your face as possible. Do again.<br>  4) Rotating crunches- When you do your crunch, make sure your hands are touching your head, left elbow to right knee, and right elbow touching the left knee alternating. Do sets.<br>  5) Make sure you mix up your routine! These are just to get you started. Your body will get used to your routine and won't build as much muscles if you keep doing the same thing over and over! You have to always put variety in to your workout!<br>  6) If you feel confident, do the crunches with weights. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1ieKW07Naa	honest answer... zero|`|rP1WwvnVaa	do as many as you can, and make sure you do some cardio exercises too.  You have to burn off your belly fat if you want to see your abs|`|oPFhz1EPaa	I have been doing them for a while. To get fast results, you should do sit-ups every other night (if you do it every night, the muscles break down and aren't able to build back up) and do some cardio exercising also, like jogging, walking, etc. for at least 30 minutes a day. A hint, if you think cardio is boring, do it with your iPod on or while you watch TV! That's what I do. I have been doing sit-ups for a really long time and I haven't gotten many results, but I JUST started adding cardio in, and it seems to be working. Good luck! :)|`|lcuxD3qlaa	I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k?

GBG2hbQ4aa	It can be easy to let your mind get away from you.  To get caught up in the possibility of what might be there.<br>  <br>  There is some air movement in most homes, so that can account for the sensation that something is moving your hair.  The air from a heating/air vent can be blowing your hair a bit, or a draft from an open window.<br>  <br>  Too, it is normal for your peripheral vision to catch a glimpse of something that appears to be moving.  Because your peripheral vision is not real exact, it is easy to misinterpret what you just saw.  As soon as you turn your head toward the movement, your central vision can focus and you see there is no one there.  [I am forever catching a reflection of myself in the double pane of the kitchen window....it always startles me so that I have to check and make sure there's no one there.  Double pane windows are notorious for that illusion.] <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to examine your surroundings carefully to assure yourself that everything is as it should be.  If you should sense movement out of the corner of your eye, focus on where that movement was and identify what is there. Do deep breathing when you get anxious.<br>  <br>  It helps to talk things out when you are experiencing such a high level of discomfort.  Talk with your folks, or with a trusted friend, or the school counselor.  It helps just to be able to get it out of your head, to talk about it out loud.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I assume you are using an over the counter medicine like Monistat.  You can use it any time that you experience symptoms of a yeast infection, like itching, redness and pain.  I always get the Monistat 7, which gives a thorough treatment for a week.  Avoid sex while treating for a yeast infection or you can pass it to your partner and he may not have any symptoms but can give it back to you.  Always put the medicine in right before you get into bed so it doesn't drain out and will have all night to do its work.<br>  <br>  best wishes..
lPrfbb1Maa	haha im not sure.. But i also have this the Right side of my jaw is longer so puts my chin about 1cm - 1.5cm to the left.

An occasional chocolate bar is ok when you're PMSing- I'm not gonna lie, I have a Caramel Macchiatto and a Milky Way everyday around that time of the month.<br>  Just do your time on the treadmill and stay away from the simple sugars and salts (as much as possible) and you should be fine (especially if the rest of the month you do better than that).<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|pQszqyTgaa	I say...when its that time of the month, we feel like crap.

Usually its only on the first day of your period that you binge (at least thats how I am).

Just last week I literally inhaled 20 hotdogs/3loaves of bread/perogies/cheese/yogurt!!!! Just drink lots of water and fill your belly with water and fiberous foods(wich are veryyyyyyy filling) before you even look at that bag of chips!!! I find those fiber one brand bagels very filling!!!! I think our hormones are really trying to help us so we don't get dehydrated during this time. Really I think that we are just more thirsty than usual but our brains tend to trick us to feel hungry soooo just fill up on extra fluids and stay away from salty stuff!! Idk but I use to be really active lately I have been lazy and i swearrrr on my life that my appetite has increased during this time...so maybe if u work out regularly you might slow down your appetite and u have nothing 2 lose...hehehe i use 2 excersize 6 days a week now I'm soooo lazy I only do 1 day a week and i feel like a pig x[ eating all my family's fridge out xD

wFN8bVqsaa	Supposedly, exercise does help with cramps. I have learned (through reading and experience) that you should avoid caffeine, soda, chocolate, etc (they make cramps worse). The only real way I know to shorten your period is to go on birth control pills. I went from a seven day period to a three day period. Good luck at cheer clinic!|`|QoS8ChCnaa	Usually you can't make you're period shorter withina  span of a few days... But birth control can do that sometimes.<br>  Also, bananas DO help with getting rid of cramps, also try using midol or something like that, it helps with many signs of pms|`|BK535teoaa	Taking pain medication, and some herbal tea's should help with the cramps. (along with a heating pad and such). I don't know if this helps with all girls, but usually i take tylenol for cramps, and this time decided to take advil. It stopped my period for 24 hours (the second day) and its been much lighter. I know it doesn't work for everyone, but if you usually don't take advil maybe try that. It worked for me. The only thing is i still got cramps and bloating and all that bad stuff which sucked. But maybe it'll work for you. Also exercise can help for cramps, and taking vitamin B. (thats what i heard, doesn't help me much though)

They are:<br>  The Avoider: Avoiders refuse to fight. When a conflict arises, they will leave, fall asleep, pretend to be busy at work, or keep from facing the problem in some other way. This behavior makes it very difficult for their spouses/friends to express feelings of anger, hurt, etc., because avoiders won't fight back. Arguing with an avoider is like trying to box with a person who won't even put up his gloves.<br>  <br>  The Denier: Not only do deniers refuse to face up to a conflict, they pretend that there is nothing at all wrong. This denial really drives their friends/spouses crazy when they definitely feel there is a problem, and it causes them to feel both guilt and resentment toward the accommodater.<br>  <br>  The Guilt Maker: Instead of dealing with feelings directly, guilt makers try to change their spouse's or friend's behavior by attempting to have them take responsibility for causing pain. The guilt maker's favorite line is "It's okay, don't worry about me..." accompanied by a big sigh.<br>  <br>  The Subject Changer: Really a type of avoider, the subject changer escapes facing up to anger by shifting the conversation whenever it approaches a conflictual stage. Because of these tactics, subject changers and their spouses/friends never have the chance to explore their problem and do something about it.<br>  <br>  The Sniper: Rather than come out and express their feelings about the object of their dissatisfaction, snipers will attack their friend's/spouse's behavior by making sarcastic comments. If their friends/spouses respond in a hurt fashion, snipers might say, "I was only kidding!" Their spouses/friends never know for sure what the problem is because snipers don't share what is really bothering them and the relationship moves farther apart.<br>  <br>  The Therapist: Instead of allowing their friends/spouses to honestly express their feelings, therapists go into character analysis, explaining what the other person really means or what is wrong with the other person. By behaving this way, they refuse to handle their own feelings and leave no room for their fri|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-d...</a><br>  <br>  Anger tends to be more of a behavioral problem than a disease.|`|dab47577283a37a55ea29d50e0ddbb45aa	AD(H)D is attention deficit (hyperactive) disorder<br>  <br>  pretty much means you have trouble concentrating on the task at hand. if it's ADHD then you would also be hyper, un albe to sit still for more then a few moments. to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing that definitely says AD(H)D is genetic. my father and one of my 3 siblings has it, but no one else in either family tree does. <br>  <br>  other signs are poor performance in school work, trouble taking notes, poor interpersonal relationships... bunch of stuff.. if you think you have it get tested. it's a simple behavioral test a psychologist can give you. all they do is ask you question and monitor your response to them, watching body language as well as verbal response.|`|13G7AxsRaa	Asking questions like this, liking shiny things, making jokes like ADOS, and just in case you have it and are going to look it up i will save you time it means "attention deficit ooh shiny"

If it is short term things that you are forgetting then write them down, if it is important.  Like a phone number or task you needed to do.

AA10369952	First off, changing your dosage of any medication is dangerous and not a good idea.  I would suggest you stick with what your neurologist told you.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is find a new neurologist, let them know you are "self-pay", and begin treatment again.  They will be able to adjust your dosages as necessary.  The self-pay is important because they will adjust medications to be less expensive and will likely charge you less for office visits.<br>  <br>  Have you tried a diary?

ko9Zy9k7aa	heyy,<br>  <br>  After youve had braces your teeth will move afterwards if u dont wear the retainers, but they rarely go back to original state, they normally just move back a little and then stop. if they continue to move, try putting your retainer back in, it will hurt alot. Try moistening it up with some really hot water, it should not hurt as much then. <br>  <br>  If you have no luck with trying to put it back in or it hurts too much, then go back to your dentist. They can either make u a new retainer, to fit your bite as it is now, so you teeth will not move anyt further so long as you wear this one.<br>  <br>  Or they may recommend you get braces again, if your teeth are causing you stress or pain or you have major over bite. They will probs just say your own fault, dont worry bout it. if you get braces again, you're 19, you will have to pay unless you are in full time education.<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  i never wear my retainer either, but my teeth havent moved back much.<br>  <br>  Xx
bcc8647434f2debeaef0e3a8f2b04b1baa	if your teeth have moved too much wearing you ret may not be an option.  you may need to call your orthodontist office, they can make a new retainer for you that will hold your teeth in their curr. place or may propose a limited retreatment.  if you dont get another ret. at least to hold them in their curr place they are likely to move back to their previous positions. unfortunately the roots of your teeth have a memory of where they were in the beginning|`|AA10784260	yes try the retainer again but if doesnt help seek help from another dentist

I'm not being sarcastic at all, I'm just curious why you chose that name?

Some medications should not be crushed, mainly because they are timed-release (i.e., they have layers with different levels which are meant to be released into your system slowly as you digest them.)  A good indicator that it is this type of medication is that the brand name has extra letters at the end (e.g., SR, ER). There are other, less-common reasons not to crush as well. Check the medication's website or with your doctor.|`|WYlHY8jQaa	Yes it works the same.|`|BCluX5xVaa	Do not listen to any of the above answers. First it matters which type of pill you are taking. True, some will be absorbed faster but that isn't always good and can be down right dangerous if too high of a dosage is absorbed to quickly. Some are coated to pass through the harsh acidic environment of the stomach and disintegrate in the intestines. There is no right answer unless you say what pill it is you are taking. The one absolute wrong answer is that they work just the same. Maybe visit the website the one person posted to see if the pill you are taking can be crushed.|`|ERFgFIziaa	Yes , the same just a lil faster as some pills have coatings that take a lil bit to disolve.

Someone with extreme paranoia would not.  <br>  <br>  A lot of us have felt similar at some point and to some degree.   You might need support in person from either a friend or a qualified counsellor to work on your self worth feelings that you describe.  Hopefully you've had a good opportunity to tell your new guy honestly why you get like you do.  <br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you.|`|AA11080047	why don't you see a therapist you need to unload all your pent up emotions. what it is you have met somebody that treats you like a human being and you cant handle the situation because your to use to being abused so get  some therapy.|`|1AP5gVygaa	Hi, sorry to hear things are a bit tough. Trust me, you should talk to him about everything even personal issues. that's what partners are for. I would always hope people would tell me their problems in a relationship coz i woud want to help. It seems he cares about you so i'm sure he wouldn't want u to keep things upsetting to yourself. It will make your relationship much stronger. all the best. : )
ncUhlwevaa	It's very very unlikely. You would have to kiss it less than 5 seconds after someone who had herpes and was experiencing an outbreak kissed the exact spot you kissed with an open sore. Not likely. Herpes only lives for 5 seconds on anything other than human skin.|`|nIOocQtnaa	Take a clorox wipe and rub it on the spot where u want to kiss it. That should make it nice and sanitary. It will have kind of a bad taste to it, but ur just giving it one small kiss. Just make sure to swoosh water around in your mouth after you kiss the stone so u don't swollow  the clorox cleaning stuff.<br>  <br>  Sinceraly<br>  Noelle|`|B6ioLtejaa	I got the Herp form kissing a toilette seat on a dare so anything is possible. Don't kiss anything my friend, don't kiss anything.|`|fk9AvB25aa	That is not likely to happen. Herpes likes skin to skin contact to pass on and it doesn't like to live on objects for more then seconds. You have nothing to worry about. You would have a better chance if you kissed some one with oral herpes.
XTmiI44laa	Well lets not have him dead and buried already, there are all kinds of treatments now.<br>  <br>  There is  nothing a person resents more than after hearing a person has cancer they think of how long that person has to live.<br>  <br>  More people die in road accidents|`|3sriJtSkaa	Lung cancer is bad but it does not mean death.<br>  I know it's scary but wait for the test results before you freak out. You obviously know that any type of lung cancer has the potential to be very dangerous BUT we have made amazing progress in the treatment and detection of the cancer and the survival rates for cancer, most especially when it's detected early, are much better than you probably think. Lung cancer is not a death sentence, thousands of people successfully recieve treatment and go into remission every year. when the doctor reads the PET scan, they will be able to assign your dad a "stage" which will tell you if the cancer is big or has spread anywhere else. The "stage" he gets is very important, it is usually a good predictor of how hard it will be to treat him. stages are a number 1-4 and a letter, stage 1A is good, stage 4 is not so good. that said, there are people who survive stage 4 cancers, they just have to fight much harder to do it. <br>  The outcome of lung cancer is very hard to predict but until the doctor can take a look at him and give you a better idea of how bad the situation is, just make sure to spend time with him and let him know you love him and you're there for him.|`|ZOKEWd5Daa	here are they <a href="http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/03/teens-and-blood-cancers.html" rel="nofollow">http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>|`|ZjUc4waiaa	I was 7 when my mom died from lung cancer.

I am now 12 and its been really hard but you have to keep moving on i know thats what everybody's going to tell you but its very true!|`|AA11405606	My dad too was just diagnosed with lung cancer.

hlYZeY4vaa	Yeah, actually. Herpes sometimes is called the "silent disease." You can have it or have been exposed to it, but never have outbreaks or show symptoms. In my case, I went in for an annual STD screening and found out that I was HSV-1 positive. It was weird to me because everything else came out negative. I never had any outbreaks or anything, it just showed up in the test. You can be a carrier for the disease and never have an outbreak. Also, herpes can stay in your body for years and you could have an outbreak years from the initial infection. Test if you are unsure. Good luck!|`|J4hOL3oLaa	a person can have herpes forever and never know...or have 1 outbreak and never have any symptoms again but still have it and still be able to give it to others.|`|jxIt38qnaa	Possibly.  You actually may just not notice anything at all until you finally notice something.|`|7uSSJPMKaa	Yes.  What symptoms are you having?|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Yup. You could NEVER get any symptoms but still have it and pass it on unknowingly.|`|fk9AvB25aa	Yes it is. Your body can suppress the herpes virus for months or even years after contracting it. This is how many people who have herpes didn't know that they had it.<br>  HSV1 and 2 positive, all from one guy and we are monogamus.
sPT8ikgXaa	That is a second degree burn.  Those bubbles with liquid are called blisters.  Please don't pop them.  Your body will reabsorb the liquid and begin to heal on its own.  As far as a scar, that will depend on whether or not you pick at it, if you start messing with the blisters and picking at the skin, then yes, it may leave a scar.  Its best to leave it alone, keep it clean (with cool water & mild soap) and let it heal.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	My guess is you have just experienced an unusual period from the Mirena.  This could have even been between period spotting and you will still have your period this month.  Implantation bleeding doesn't usually last that long.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|KnZW05kfaa	it's probably from the mirena.  i had one put in myself about 5 years ago and mine started off fine for a few months.  Then all of the sudden i was having my period constantly.  i would have it for a month and then off for a couple days and right back on it.  this went one for almost 2 years and finally the iud just fell out in the shower one day.  i would talk to your doc and make sure, because trust me, the nonstop period is NO FUN
66uEENzFaa	you'll probably lose more than 30-40 pounds<br>  but that's just my guess
CZ9WhEXJaa	It sounds like a hernia...which is when there's a weakness in your stomach muscles, and blips of intestines pop out when you increase internal abdominal pressure (via coughing, laughing, etc.)...but nah, that wouldn't develop randomly, and from what you've said it sounds like it randomly started a few hours ago.  It could be digestion problem?  Maybe gas?  Carbonated drinks can help relieve those issues :-P  :-)   it could also be something with the ovary on that side, but that, again, wouldn't happen randomly and hurt so much out of the blue.  (Actually it might, with ovarian torsion, but that's super super rare.)<br>  <br>  Btw, appendicitis pain usually starts vaguely around the belly button, and then localizes around the appendix area (right lower region).  Did that happen with you?<br>  <br>  This site is helpful I think.<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/appendicitis/DS00274/DSECTION=symptoms" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/appendi...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  If the pain remains following bowel release, urination, and rest, I'd have it checked out (wait a few hours basically, unless it really starts bugging you or you really think it's something).  Then go to your doc or the local ER and have it checked out.  They'll probably do a CT scan or ultrasound to see what's going on.  Doesn't hurt, and it's better to be safe than sorry as they say.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and God Bless! :-)|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Do you have a temperature?

Sometimes it takes as long as a week or ten days. <br>  <br>  Without treatment, many die within 24 hours.

uVMlNvLoaa	It all depends on when in your cycle you had sex.<br>  <br>  If you had it right after your period or right before (plus or minus 1-3 days), chances are fairly low, around 20%.<br>  <br>  At the most fertile time in your cycle, chances are around 60-70, without any methods (including pulling out).<br>  <br>  Wise up.

Z5vvgPnOaa	The shingles vaccine is recommended for people over 60 - because the elderly are most at risk of developing shingles.<br>  <br>  You should go to the doctor and talk about your history. The fact that you have had shingles twice so close together suggests that your immune system is not working as well as it should for someone your age. You need to have a general checkup including a full blood count and then the doctor can determine whether to give you the vaccine or not.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|CJkZpWv0aa	The vaccine is meant for people age 60 or older.
ldpDzaolaa	Either dryness, or blood pressure or sinus infection. Have you been taking alot of asprin or motrin for muscle pains? Any recent injury to the nose? the headaches might be the clue for sinus infection, or polyps.

00fSfCdFaa	Sorry I cant tell you what you want to hear. You have to rest this ankle and not exercise on it for at least a week. <br>  <br>  The key to managing any sprained ankle is RICE<br>  <br>  REST! You cannot perform competitive sports on this ankle. If you strain it further you could do a serious injury and ruin your sporting career. Give it some FULL rest for at least a week, a fortnight is best then you can start doing lighter-moderate exercise on it. <br>  <br>  ICE: You've already done this so whilst you are sitting resting the ankle keep a swaddled ice pack over it to reduce the swelling. I also include ibuprofen under here so take ibuprofen  (or similar NSAID) regularly- 2 every 4-6 hours for the next 3 days.<br>  <br>  COMPRESSION: you can buy support bandages and tubigrips from most chemists/pharmacies. Wear this constantly during the day, taking it off only at night. Keep it on for at least a week, preferably for a fortnight and whilst doing exercise for the next 4 weeks. <br>  <br>  ELEVATION: Keep your foot up as much as you can over the next week this helps the swelling go down it also ensures that you rest the ankle. <br>  <br>  If you insist on competing, at the very least make sure you wear a proper support bandage, specially designed for the ankle joint to offer it maximum support whilst you exercise. If you go over on it again whilst it is still loose you can tear a ligament, or worse so do be careful.|`|ACMPEzqQaa	This takes time and effort, it's also not a lot of fun. <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Speed-healing-of-trauma-injuries-through-self-directed-regeneration" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Speed-healing-of...</a>
16NYiltUaa	i know exactly what your going through. pretty much everything you said has happened to me. i too, am afraid that i will slip into an episode, especially since sometimes they are very bad. I'll admit that i never got any help for it- i kind of just decided to deal with it. it basically controlled my life at one point. i wish i hadn't done that. if at all possible, try to make an appointment with a doctor. they may be able to prescribe something that can help you. it would definitely be the best thing to do, because trust me, i learned the hard way.|`|inST4SlAaa	if your other state of mind is sleep like, i would research narcolepsy<br>  Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder (a dyssomnia) characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. The condition is most characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in which a person experiences extreme tiredness and possibly falls asleep during the day at inappropriate times, such as at work or school. A narcoleptic will most probably experience disturbed nocturnal sleep, which is often confused with insomnia, and disorder of REM or rapid eye movement sleep.<br>  <br>  depersonalization disorder  are triggered by abuse, trauma, and drug use, although a variety of genetic and environmental factors are implicated. Depersonalization disorder can be conceptualized as a defense mechanism as the core symptoms of the disorder are thought to protect the victim from negative stimuli. <br>  <br>  Depersonalization disorder is often comorbid with anxiety disorders, panic disorders, clinical depression and/or bipolar disorder which does not seem to coincide with your history|`|P8Go5zHSaa	I used to have that exact same thing, almost like your just along for the ride in another persons body when really its just you. It got really bad for me at some points and caused an "emotional numbness" for me.<br>  It really helped me to think of life as what it is, and just LIVE it to the best of your ability and enjoy it. Think of it as, "I grew up in this life, and its the only one i know, so really, what else is there?". Im not trying to be religious or spiritual but just logical because it helped me. So just tell the depersonalization to literally f*** off and get out of your life, however odd this may sound. Hope this method works out for you as it did for me.
AA10531094	Soak your feet in warm salt water (20 mins.) and use a pumice stone to get the dead skin off. After you're finished soaking your feet, apply vaseline and cotton socks.

m1Kjxlkvaa	are you worried about anything,it could be tension headache, try to relax first of all, tense all your body muscles, and then drop them, do it a few times, and it helps to soften the muscles, take migralieve tablets, do you need glasses or a new eye test?get one of those eye masks that you put int he fridge, put it on forehead,it is very cold,but helps to sooth head.if not a cold cloth is good, you need to try to relax as much , as tension is maybe causing this
PyNtY2Ataa	it is also very addictive so you may not be able to stop - ever.<br>  <br>  so don't start|`|uJDPFp1Raa	Marijuana is mostly a really mild drug. It's not like alcohol or some other drugs where you forget things, or are so impaired you can hardly walk. I've never heard of anyone getting actual hallucinations. I don't think it affects vision at all but some people do sometimes think things look brighter, or more colorful.  You never lose feeling in your body, or feel like things are out of control. Your mind still functions. As for the world spinning I think that's an exaggeration. Kind of airy headed would be a better way to describe it. <br>  <br>  Marijuana will never kill you, that's a sad ignorance a lot of people seem to have. Don't listen to them. Neither is it physically addictive like cigarettes, or alcohol.|`|6yt7mDcIaa	Yes that's all true, although hallucinations themselves would be mild and not like an "acid" trip, you may see things that aren't there- especially colours. It is also possible that you experience a dream like state where you become detached from the world around you. It could become like a nightmare and you could have a panic attack caused by the drug. It is impossible to tell how the drug will affect you even if you have smoked it many times and have only had good effects.|`|OQS1k0mYaa	i wouldn't go as far to say yes to what you stated above,as it effects everyone differently.<br>  in medical purposes it relieves pain by dulling the senses.<br>  for recreational use it can have the opposite effect i.e going through a host of feelings from euphoria to paranoia.<br>  as to say it's addictive,mentally yes, does your body crave it as it would taking much harder drugs i would have to say no.<br>  better still if you haven't bothered with it now why start.|`|m1Kjxlkvaa	my friends son used to do that, it made him manic depressive, and wanted to kill himself, so take a warning, don't even go there. he has been struggling with mental health now for five years now, and still not better|`|R5M79Z7Oaa	it just made my eyes really heavy and that was about it. its not all its cut out to be tbh. x
00fSfCdFaa	HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is transmitted via blood, sexual fluids and breast milk. <br>  <br>  Basically it is a virus which infects cells of the immune system (T cells). This leads to destruction of the T cells by the virus itself (during replication) but also the person's remaining immune system destroys the infected T cells. <br>  <br>  Over time, the immune system is severely damaged and the person becomes susceptible to infections- chest infections, fungal infections, urinary infections etc. They cannot form an immune defence to these infections and so get really sick. <br>  <br>  When the immune system is really really damaged, they start getting really rare but extremely serious infections- the person is said to have AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). These nasty infections such as pneumocystis carinii (type of chest infection) toxoplasmosis (fungal brain infection) and rare cancers too is what finishes the person off. <br>  <br>  Thankfully, the drug treatments they have today allow a person to live for decades, infection free without progressing into AIDS. Prior to this death was inevitable within 10 years<br>  <br>  The ultimate prevention is practicing safe sex (condoms) and avoiding contaminated blood- not sharing needles etc.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	zini has it right. <br>  Basically, HIV isn't the thing that would kill you. It's not like a flu where you just have it, and thats it. It affects your immune system, so if you DID get something like the flu, your body can't fight it off, and a simple thing like a cold or infection can finish you off.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	HIV fights your immune system which fight off illnesses. Slowly it destroys the while blood cells that fight off things like colds, flu and other illnesses. We all have T-cells, a normal count is somewhere between 800 and 1400, when someone is infected with HIV the count starts to drop. When it drops below 200 then a person is diagnosed with AIDS. Which mean that person can get infections that are hard to fight off and could end up taking a life.
U0KzxpJfaa	Everybody is different but honestly it's not that bad!<br>  At first mine weren't sore but then a few hours on I started to feel my teeth being pushed together. It just felt like my teeth were kind if tight. It wasn't too bad. The worst part for me was the brackets rubbing off my mouth and the wire at the end but if you get wax you'll be fine! If the wire at the back hurts just go to the ortho and they'll clip it for you. You'll know what I mean when you get them! People exaggerate the pain a lot! Eat before you go, so then if you do have any pain you won't need to eat right after. Take some mild painkillers and eat soft foods. You'll feel like you'll never get used to them but now I can't imagine myself without braces and I only got them in June!<br>  There is no pain in getting them put on, so don't worry!<br>  x :D|`|95E5EfPlaa	i just got mine last Wednesday. They don't hurt in the process of being put on. but the days after it will be hard to eat. its monday now and mine are still sore to eat.|`|PDYiwb3Raa	I have had braces twice in my life so yeah I know. It won't hurt that much as they put them on but after a while your mouth will hurt and be irritated. It's just because the braces are pulling on your teeth so your gums are trying to keep them in place. Braces will also feel a bit strange because you have all this metal in your mouth. Almost like having a piece of gum on top of your teeth. Don't worry though because the pain will go away after your teeth and gums get used to having braces on them. This usually takes like 3-4 days. Best of luck!!|`|ppjDKvZzaa	I get my braces off monday! not how much they hurt getting off though.. What i do know is i was SO nervous when i got them on. I asked everywhere this same question! And everyone told me ... it dosent hurt it dosent hurt... so im going to tell you a little bit of what does hurt... and btw... IT DOSENT HURT! i had chapped lips when they put mine on... BAD IDEA. my mouth is so small! so thats something that hurt.. be prepared to bring chapstick, if you have tis same problem. Cause your mouth will STRETCH. The rest of the procedure is pretty easy though. Impressions suck ... but i have terrible gag reflexes. I also have BAD migranes ... so a coulpe hours after you get them on they will HURT ... but just take some advil and youll b ok.... I hope this helped... GOOD LUCK!|`|KGIfK0Y9aa	For about a week... not too bad :)   Just make sure to eat all the candy and popcorn you can be4 the treatment!!!|`|WcTTQMDaaa	lk 1-10 itd be lk 2<br>  it hurts when you eat for lk 3 days but thats it dont worry lol|`|QiSG3PXsaa	they don't hurt.<br>  u r just a lil sore afterwords!

Your body has a knack for taking care of itself provided you give it the nutrients to do so and in the needed quantity.<br>  <br>  If you fear for your health, consult a doctor.  But the best advice in this situation is to pay attention to your body.  it is designed to let you know when it is in distress for whatever reason.|`|otsuH97Jaa	same thing here, hun. :l You don't want to gain fat though, remember. And the scale thing, perfectly fine. Your weight should always drift around 3lbs. So one day you could weigh 80, the next 79, and then the next 81. It's perfectly normal. You want to gain muscle mass, so eat some good ol' chicken and fish... I personally dont like fish so I eat lean steak instead. And then you want to do some weight training. Nothing abnormal, but seriously do it. One day lift for your arms, the next day don't do anything about your arms and instead focus on your legs. =] Try not to skip days.|`|gktbI6dEaa	weird. accutane didn't do anything to my weight. it is a pretty strong medication though.

It could be your thyroid gland. Weight can also fluctuate daily, especially if you've eaten salty food, right before your period, or exercised and perspired a lot. Try not to panic, just talk to your doc so you can get the best advice possible about weight, eating right, and your metabolism. <br>  <br>  Ah ha...Okay, well I've read your update, and if you're not eating enough calories this is probably the reason for your weight issues. I'm glad you're in therapy. And I hope you allow your therapist to talk with your doctor. It may still be a good idea to see about blood tests. <br>  <br>  And for the person who asked about Accutane - it's a medication for acne.|`|qRAwBtJ5aa	you might have a really fast metabosim, or maybe you are speeding it up by eating fat burning foods chilli, green tea etc.<br>  you could be undereating. so simply eat more.<br>  alternatively if you have drastic weight loss there may be a serious problem to cause that.<br>  alternatively you may have a tapeworm infectition.|`|tehdmkjkaa	Start working out with high weight and low reps and eat alot.You have either a hyper Metabolism or your body is not processing food the way it should.

That could become dangerous.|`|QRCQJF6Faa	Your weight sounds pretty good for your height but yea, you could and will, in time, gain more weight, but you do need to eat more. From what you are saying you are afraid to eat but want to gain weight, so the best thing I can suggest is to eat more often but keep your meals small. <br>  <br>  The main thing I wanted to point out is it is NORMAL for the body to bounce between a few pounds of weight from day to day, again NORMAL so don't "freak out" over anything less than 5 lbs per week and you should be fine. And a good way to keep from 'freaking out" would be to only weigh yourself each Monday Morning, not evey day.<br>  <br>  The reason the body changes weight from time to time is mostly because of water stored in the body, by itself a glass of water does not seem to have much weight to it but when you fill up a bucket or a big barrel you can really see how much water can weigh and you can then see if your body is holding more water one day and less another that your weight will change from day to day. It will also change from morning to night and of course before and after you eat, so again, all this is NORMAL and no need to "freak out".<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Adam-O|`|FSOI5jbsaa	see a doctor/nutritionist that would really help...sorry if i didn't help that much! ;)

Have your mom get you some anti diarrhea medication from any store that sell OTC medicine.Any brand will do. And don't eat or drink anything dairy, that also causes diarrhea. As soon as you get the medicine take it as directed and the diarrhea should stop within a few hours, plenty of time for a night sleep. Good luck and feel better soon. BTW- you need to stop any carbonated drinks too.

That's why for skinny people it's so hard to get muscles. After you've accomplished that, then lose the fat. It will be easier if you also do some cardio while gaining muscle.|`|OleVPkJgaa	lose the fat first. It will give you more energy to build the muscle up afterward. but unless you have a major gut, you should prolly just work in some Cardio and Muscle Toning at the same time. That makes it so you aren't sluggish.|`|r7tWe5dqaa	As you gain muscle you will be losing fat automatically. So that seems like it would be the best place to start.

nAp688tZaa	It is generally considered safe to take them both, but you need to keep one thing in mind.  Both of these medications are Central Nervous System depressants and could slow your heart rate and depress your breathing.  If you have never taken them together in the past it would be wise to have someone with you the first couple of times you take them.  Just let that person know exactly what you are taking and what they need to watch for, just in case they need to take you into the ER.  If you get both prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy, or the same chain of national pharmacies, then they would have been able to advise you of any drug interactions.  I do know, however, from personal experience that these can be taken together.  I sometimes get panic attacks too (maybe 2 per year) and need to take an anti-anxiety medication.  I am also in pain management for an injury to my neck and take narcotic pain medicine every day until I am able to get the surgery I need.<br>  <br>  BTW-Talismb, you are completely out of line cursing at this person.  You do not know anything about her medical condition and you do not know if she was or was not advised to take this much Xanax at one time.  Considering that 2 mg's is the highest recommended dosage at one time for someone, it is possible that this is how her doctor prescribed the medication.  Maybe you should get the facts before you climb up on your "holier than thou" pedestal.  Just a thought...|`|143bm6cnaa	Its OK, but don't operate heavy machinery like a car, don't sign any legal documents.|`|AA10529994	I was going to comment that maybe you should talk to you doctor, rather than random strangers online, but I see you are ignoring him as it is so why bother asking him this question...why not take 5-10 a day...your making up your dose as you go anyway so what the heck?  I'd say it's totally safe, but you should also be drinking vodka at the same time (to wash the pills down)
5bYpbodUaa	When I was a freshman in high school, I had braces put on. My eye teeth were a bit out to where I looked like I had vampire teeth. LOL Anyway, the neck gear that I had to wear at night really helped the process in my teeth getting straight. I had mine on for a year and a half. <br>  <br>  The trick in taking care of your teeth and making sure you have a successful process and a timely process of wearing your braces, all depends on how well you take care of your teeth and follow your orthodontists instructions. The person you are talking about that has had them on for three years, probably has other issues regarding them and needs to wear them longer. Some people can't afford the dentist any more (especially will a lot of families losing their incomes), so that may reflect on their kids continuing the dental visits for their braces and getting them off. <br>  <br>  After you get your braces off, if you do not wear your retainer like you should, or as often as you should, your teeth will start to move and become crooked again. Just an FYI note for ya there. My step brother had his one for a long time, got them off, and he never wore his retainer. Now his teeth are back to being crooked. Talk about a waste of money there. So, remember to do everything you are told to help along the process. <br>  <br>  I was one of the lucky ones myself not having to wear my braces past a year and a half.  :-)|`|ny94EXcGaa	well i dont know your question.. but yeah orthodontist are magic men. !!  they can make you suffer or make you HAPPY..  haha well your case doesnt seem too bad. So yeah LUCKY DOG.

I have had my braces for 2 years and i chew gum and eat other hard and chewy things and they have not broke.
9iOHAC41aa	Well, studies show that most women continue to grow until about the age of 20, so it's possible that your boobs are growing a little. It could also be a period symptom. It could mean that your pregnant. It could mean that you have fibro cystic breast changes, which is what i have, and oddly enough it makes your boobs bigger for about 3 weeks out of the month, but unfortunately it can also be a little on the painful side. I wouldn't be too concerned with it if i were you though, because it could be several things. If it doesn't stop with in the next week or so i would probably see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|fvuEtkROaa	Premenstrual  ?  Pregnancy  ?  Mastitis ?|`|QsbB6vkoaa	it can be that they are growing. or can you be pregnant? it can also be a hormonal thing so if you can talk to your doctor, maybe they can put you on the pill to regulate your hormones.<br>  good luck|`|v30TPwUtaa	Growing, period, pregnant, the list could go on.
uVMlNvLoaa	Read the little insert that comes with the box of tampons. We can only help so much online as much as the diagram.<br>  <br>  However, if you're having trouble inserting the tampon itself, lube it up a bit and put it in.|`|QJHE3z1raa	use a mirror|`|OsT64mqMaa	Definitely use a mirror. And try putting one foot up on something if you can get that chance. It is much easier to see.|`|dpgXzMenaa	There's only one wet, slippery, bleeding place that it can easily fit into.  Put it *there*.<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|SbZG9iPfaa	In the middle hole.<br>  <br>  If you look through a mirror down there, you will see you butthole, a hole right above it and then you will see you clitoris which i call your pee hole. lol<br>  <br>  <br>  It goes in the hole right above the butthole.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	read the instructions carefully, and don't worry i once put a tampon in with the little plastic. it wasn't pretty. the point is when you first start out you will make mistakes, but you will soon become an expert.<br>  practice makes perfect|`|uaHzhUeoaa	If you're inserting a tampon, you must be on your period... so check to see which hole you're bleeding from if you're unsure.|`|B6ioLtejaa	Without sounding weird, it goes in the vaginal.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	You may have some bleeding beneath the repair which may require a second surgery to locate the bleeding vein and stop it.  Sometimes a small vein will blow after the repair is done, and that would explain the bruising in the testicle.  For now, I suggest lying on your back and trying to apply an ice pack or heat pack- whichever feels best to you.  It may also feel better if the fellows are contained in either a jock strap or a pair of shorts snug enough to keep the package up against your body and not able to move about much.  Unfortunately that's all the help I have to offer you that will be of much use.  There are a few things that could be the source of the pain, but without a physical exam, it's hard to say exactly what the cause of it is.  For now, snug up the package, apply heat or cold to your comfort, and use something like Motrin for the pain.  You could take up to 800mg every 12 hours, in one large dose.  Hopefully that will help make you more comfortable until you can see your doctor.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	You may have a bleed that is forming a hematoma, and it is possible that you will have to have surgical intervention to stop the bleeding.  Cold packs and remaining immobile is best until you can be examined.  If the pain becomes intolerable, call your doctor tonight.

SJunThLBaa	im also 15 and weigh 155 at 5'10 although im still an average build but what you need to do is to eat alot of carbs and protein before bed which converts most of the undigested food into fat. Then what you want to do is convert that into muscle by lifting. For a stronger chest do atleast 100 pushups a day and bench press every other day. For stronger arms keep curling and most if not all chest workouts use biceps as a secondary muscle.|`|B7jaxWCCaa	85 pounds!!!!!!!!!!!! what′s your height?<br>  <br>  chest flies are awsome|`|PoWNBIDUaa	I started working out 5 months ago.

JFo1tiaQaa	I think its a good idea to try non surgical spinal decompression. There are no side effects. Treatment is painless, easy and results are quick. No medication, no surgery, no side effects....<br>  <br>  I would exhaust all treatment options before going for surgery. Surgery is invasive, and there is rehab involved. Plus you have to get medication for pain control and to control infections etc. <br>  <br>  Most people who get on this treatment are suffering from severe chronic lower back pain. Most times, surgery is the last option, and they have been recommended surgery by their orthopedic. They have tried drugs, epidurals, injections, PT, chiro, acupuncture and traction. <br>  <br>  Not everyone is a candidate for this though- if you have had fusion surgery in the lumbar spine, surgical repair of an abdominal aorta, a fracture or cancer of the L spine or pelvis or suffer from severe osteoporosis-  you may not be a candidate. The Dr has to take a look at your MRI's as well to assess the disc level. <br>  <br>  I have never  heard of any side effects of the treatment, so I would go for a consult to see if you are a candidate for this treatment. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.s I have seen many people who have been helped with non surgical spinal decompression- please at least see a Dr to see if you qualify for treatment. I have given you some good links to see how this treatment helped others.|`|xrq4qKRbaa	DO not use the DRX I tried it with my 10mm L3-L4 herniated disc and it caused me to have surgery.

t9Nw86Plaa	What are the symptoms you've been noticing? PCOS is a fairly common disorder among women... but it is still important that you get a real diagnosis (since your symptoms may seem like PCOS, when they are in fact something else, or nothing... it depends on what symptoms you have. Knowing for sure that you have PCOS (or not) will make your life a lot easier in the long run). <br>  <br>  If you are not comfortable with your regular doctor giving you a physical exam, you have 2 options:<br>   - find another female doctor (any one will do)<br>   - tell him you're not comfortable with him doing a physical exam (he may get someone else to do that part, if he needs to do it at all)<br>  <br>  Again, since you don't list your symptoms its very hard for me to tell you what tests the doctor will do. Depending on what symptoms you have, they may not even want to any physical exam... they may only want to do a quick blood test, and a pelvic ultrasound.<br>  <br>  The pelvic ultrasound is the real test for PCOS (this test allows the doctor to see your ovaries (without actually looking at your private area) and count how many cysts they have (if any). <br>  <br>  But.. if you have symptoms which may be something else (not PCOS), they will run additional tests, ie. look for chlamydia, or cervical problems, which does require a physical exam. So I can't guarantee that you will get away with ONLY doing the ultrasound, since I dont know what symptoms you've been having.|`|fMiLQnSJaa	You need an OB-GYN doctor for diagnosis of PCO.  General doctors won't know what is wrong with you.  I went to 3 different doctors before this doctor figured out what was wrong.  The first doctor said I just had anemia (cause i was not having periods) and put me on iron pills and made me follow a diet.  The second doctor just kept palpating my abdomen each time I was there .. then he just said he didn't know what was wrong with me and to go see another doctor.  The third doctor did an ultra sound and blood work and also a hormone challenge and figured my problem had something to do with hormones so she sent me to the fourth doctors.  Finally the fourth doctor figured out I had PCOs and put me on medications.  Don't waste your time with regular MDs.  You need an OB/GYN|`|WKCdMPqxaa	what is pcos?
C69B6RG7aa	A lot of women have experienced negative side effects from taking Yaz (or the very similar Yasmin pill). Even though it seems to work wonders for some women, for others it is a nightmare. My experience with it was very bad. After 4 months using it, I developed severe anxiety and panic attacks, followed by a slew of other symptoms such as rapid heart rate, insomnia, and loss of appetite. <br>  <br>  There is now a lawsuit developing for the women that have had bad psychological symptoms from taking this pill. I highly recommend you do a search for the "Yasmin survivors forum" and read the threads there. The lawsuit information is also there, in a thread titled "Newest lawsuit info - Feb 2009"<br>  <br>  Good luck with your recovery!
gJRJaNj8aa	There is No way someone could say from the information you provided. First of all, No age or gender. Bipolar is more likely to come on in a persons late teens (males) or 20's. It can be seen in children but is hard to diagnose.  <br>  And the mood you are describing, would make me think if on the chance it IS bipolar that they would be in a depressive episode because Mania usually the person isn't constantly tired. Quite the opposite actually. <br>  If you are that concerned about this person that you come online to find out I suggest perhaps talking to someone locally.|`|H8bgo17Saa	Now the first answer is correct. Is this person a girl? If she is she might be on her period or something. I happen to know a bipolar person, and they aren't really how you described, in fact the only part that they had were the mood swings. Normally when someone is bipolar their modes change drastically. Seriously, he will go to being "complaney" and really mad, to crying, then to "I love you, blablabla" in less then twenty minuets. Maybe you should edit this a little and be more specific :)|`|hBmafVYoaa	It could be a hundred million things. I certainly wouldn't think of bipolar as bipolar is periods of depression and then mania.|`|AA10500537	i wouldn;t think .<br>       It sounds more like stress from the economy .<br>   If   you live in the north country or where it;s cold and snowy it could be cabin fever.<br>  Try getting out more even if it means to go  to the mall  and walk  or a good movie.<br>  Good Luck
56917efc2d4323a083e26002e4c680fcaa	I've never had my tonsils out but I have had other surgeries. The general anesthesia that you will get might start with a pill to calm you down then when everything is ready to proceed they will give you a shot thru your I.V. line and finally you will take a few breaths through a mask and before you know it your awake in the recovery room wondering when they are going to start. Its sounds scary but those Docs know their stuff. Don't sweat it.|`|de8xL7D9aa	Well they put me to sleep to have my cervix sewn closed, and it wasn't bad. I was so scared at first to get put to sleep and right after they put the mask over my face I started crying and I'm 26. It took almost 10 seconds for me to fall asleep it was the longest couple seconds ever because it felt like I was never gonna fall asleep even tho it really was so quick. I didn't feel a thing and when I woke up it felt like I was only asleep for a minute even tho it was really like 30 minutes. Recovery didn't take long I was allowed to go home like 2 hours after the surgery just wasn't allowed to drive or be alone for 24 hours. So the Anesthesia wasn't bad at all. You will be fine. I would do it again anytime without any problem, of course it would stink to have to have a reason for it. Well good luck I am sure you will be fine. From what I've heard having your tonsils taken out isn't so bad and I am sure it's worth it.|`|xz6qJHFJaa	calm done there gonna put u asleep u will wake up and be like new althought it might hurt when u move but get alot of sleep and laydoen alot dont move much ok

Self-injury is usually a symptom of a deeper problem such as depression, and you're not going to feel better unless you let people know what's going on with you. <br>  <br>  Take some deep breaths and try to relax, and understand that you need to let the people in your life know what's going on.

OYqmq1CDaa	Usually people think putting less sunscreen on makes you tan quicker. This does not help at all, it burns you quicker. If you have time to go to the beach everyday make sure you put on a lot of sunscreen (about two coats);  this helps prevent you from burning but it does take longer to tan. Then gradually, when you are starting to get darker, you can apply less sunscreen because your skin doesn't need to protect it self so much. This technique does take a fair while to make you tan but it’s the safest way. Remember if you get burnt all the time you have more risk of getting freckles, sunspots and cancer and your skin will get very delicate and weak from burning off so many layers. Hope this helped.|`|4f98fad5ad9e1132273168090fa4638faa	What kind of medicines are you taking? Some medication will make exposure to the sun more drastic than normal.

If wearing contacts is not the right option for you or not an option at all (due to eye health, your Rx, etc..), they have every right to tell you "no". This is due to liability issues and such. If they tell you "no", then there's obviously a reason for it. They're not going to tell you "no" because they don't want you to have them. They will not write out an Rx against their own judement.

If you're looking for a long-term thing though, soaking a washcloth in very warm water then laying it on your face for a few minutes, then gently scrubbing your face afterward really helps with removing blackheads.

B8WEoAiKaa	yes ! those can be genital warts! and if you slept with someone who hasn`t visible warts it doesn't mean that this person hadn't HPV!<br>  because HPV is most common STD and not always symptoms are visible! if person have stronger immune system then his body can fight genital warts by himself! and if your body is not so strong then genital warts can reappear again and again until your immune system will be strong!<br>  so just get rid of warts!<br>  <br>  in that case Wartrol is a good (probably the best) product that gets rid of genital warts and makes you feel more confident knowing that they wont show.<br>  <br>  It worked for me!<br>  <br>  I do not know if any pharmacies carry Wartrol but I do know that you should purchase it directly from the manufacturer and read more about the product here <a href="http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=749165" rel="nofollow">http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=749165</a>|`|Kx1hTUZeaa	Genital warts are sexually transmitted disease that is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). They appear as tiny cauliflower-shaped bumps that are grey or flesh-colored. They usually develop on the genital and anal area. The symptoms of genital warts may not appear for as short as a few weeks to as long as several months so it is very hard to determine whether or not you are a carrier of the virus. The best way to find out is to consult your doctor so that he/she can make the proper diagnosis and recommend the best treatment plan for your case.
NHkINK6baa	I think it would probably be best if you went and got checked out.|`|892YhtPCaa	just have early nite and if you feel bad in morning then go see doc|`|rMewByCzaa	First things first, are you experiencing nausea or vomiting? The unfocused eyes worry me, my dear. <br>  <br>  If you have not considered seeking medical attention, I would suggest doing so. If you are not trying to take this route, here are a few helpful tips.<br>  <br>  It is possible that you have a bruise and not necessarily a concussion. So to remedy this, I suggest applying ice for about 20-30 minutes and repeat every 2 hours. Bed rest, fluids and (if you are not allergic in any way) Tylenol are also a suitable. <br>  <br>  I stress that if these remedies are ineffective, please seek medical attention. Good luck and do feel better. =}<br>  <br>  -Mae.

deYDbVDSaa	If this acts up when the swelling is present then yes. The swelling of anything can put pressure on a nerve, and cause negative things to happen. Normally, it will be close to the feeling of a limb "going to sleep".<br>  The main nerve in your legs starts at the spine, runs down both butt cheeks, from the middle of each cheek to the crack, through the hip, and down both legs. This nerve is huge, and does not like anything interfering with it.<br>  <br>  Also, there is a nerve center between your balls (or vagina), and your anus. This nerve center does not like anything interfering with it either, and it especially sensitive, think: sex. This nerve center is the one that hurts when a guy gets kicked in the balls.

I have had these before and they are not the MAGIC HAPPY SHROOM that you make them sound like. These are not natural because chemicals have been added to them. If they were ok for you to eat on a regular basis then they would be sold in the stores and legal here in the US. <br>  <br>  I think that you are right... you need to find new friends. Also, have you tried talking to your parents or get counsiling at the church. I have depression and a lot of the times when we feel that people are "neglecting" us is just our minds over-reacting. Honestly, I wouldn't tell you otherwise. I know that you don't know me but I believe that it's true. <br>  <br>  If you feel that you can't talk to your family then maybe there is 1 good friend (not in the bunch that you spoke about) that you can share your feelings with. If not then please go to the doctor. They can help with this. Suicide rates are too high and I bet if your parents knew how you are feeling then they would totally trip out. You are loved by them and your siblings. <br>  <br>  Please don't do the mushrooms. Oh, if you don't want to go to the doctor you can try some natural remedies for depression like St. John's Wart, 5-HTP, and vitamin b. You also need to try and identify what it is that started making you feel this way.<br>  <br>  I hope that I have helped you somewhat. Please don't take mushrooms and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't think about suicide.|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	If you're truly depressed then you probably do need drugs, albeit the psychiatric type prescribed by a doctor. <br>  <br>  Hallucinogens can be fun, although if you go on a "bad" trip, you will be miserable, and although they are generally free of side effects, I live with a former heavy user of LSD and he still hallucinates time to time because of it. <br>  <br>  Again, the best advice I can offer you is that if you're actually depressed and suicidal, go to a doctor, please.|`|yJXlvFfeaa	well a few things here...are the mushrooms going to keep you happy.?<br>  Like a permanent trip?

Perhaps you should start off by telling someone what you wrote here.Highs don't solve problems.  they hang around and wait for you to come back down.

You're desperately in need of attention. Friends that scorn you are not friends. Find new ones. They're everywhere. Make small talk with anyone and there's a new prospect at happiness. <br>  <br>  What I've found in situations like yours is that when the whole entire world seems to be collapsing in on you, you've got to do some soul searching. You've go to look deep inside of yourself to find that little spark of life that's kept you going through all the crap. If you can do that, you've got the power to turn that **** into a wildfire. If you can pull that inner strength out of yourself, you can turn your back on all of those insignificant s***heads who you thought were your friends, and horse kick them in the F****** balls. <br>  <br>  And on the subject of shrooms; go for it. Just don't be naive about how you go about collecting them. NEVER EVER PICK YOUR OWN. This is a good way to die... Or at least aquire a horrifying case of stomach sickness. Diarrhea... Vominating... the works. "Magic Mushrooms" are easily mistaken for other more volatile fungi. Find a dealer. Or buy spores online. <br>  <br>  Also, see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_trip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_trip</a>

PfE6bg5iaa	You don't really need to collect all that information! Benefits and side effects are generally the same and depend on each induvidual.<br>  <br>  There's two types of birth control pills: combo and progesterone only (the minipill).<br>  <br>  Combo pills are the most common but also carry a higher risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart attack. Combo pills are slightly more effective than the minipill. The minipill MUST be taken at the exact same time everyday, while the combo pill should be but can be taken within 3 hours and have not much affect on the effectiveness. <br>  <br>  They all share the same common side-effects -- nausea, breast tenderness, upset stomach, etc. In addition, the minipill may cause you to skip your period entirely or have some spotting. The reason there are so many different brands is that they each have their own dosage of hormones. Every woman's body reacts differently to the dosages, so if your side effects are really severe your doctor will switch you to a different dosage/brand.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will probably choose a low-dose pill to start you on based on your weight, family history, etc. Really, if you're set on using the pill you only need to decide between the mini pill or combo pill and not worry so much about the brand. It's really no comparison, unless you're concerned about the risk of blood clots you should get the combo pill. The combo pill gave me blood clots last year and almost killed me (I'm 21) so it does happen, but the minipill is less convenient!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :-)|`|hBmafVYoaa	I can only think of web md<br>  or the Family planning association

ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Firstly, I am very sorry to hear this very sad news.<br>  The reason why you are drinking is because you are trying to block out your emotions.. That's why most people drink excessively, because they don't want to 'feel anything negative'.<br>  How did you deal with your parents death? I think what the underlying issue is that perhaps you havent dealt with your inner emotions completely. Not dealing with your emotions, over time will worsen the issue, if you do not come to terms with them and except them. Have you been to see a counsellor? I think talking things other with a professional counsellor will help you tremendously.. Or even talking to someone who can 'understand you'.. I think that you need to be understood and have someone to care for you properly hunny, whilst you are coming to terms with your circumstances....<br>  From then you will need to strengthen and pick yourself up.<br>  Please email me if you are feeling low xxxxx|`|AA11570675	I'm sorry to hear of your loss. <br>  It sounds as if you've really suffered emotionally as a result. This is normal grief which friends & family usually help people to bear. You've had no outlet for this so you've tried to use drink to blot out the pain.<br>  You're dead right to want to try a fresh start. All the effort of moving & settling in somewhere new should provide an activity focus that will help you to deal with the grief by concentrating on something else.<br>  I'm a bit worried about the new-found friend who will follow your move. Who? The one who's helped you so far - drink. You really need something to displace the drink in order to give you time to dry out  otherwise you'll be hooked. So what are you going to do instead of drinking? Sure the seaside is a great place, so maybe lots of walks or even better running along the beach or some other form of activity will help. In fact the more demanding or scary it is, the better it will work. So how about learning something new like parachuting or bungee jumping. The problem with those is they require other people's help & the temptation to drink will come when you're alone. So what can you do alone that gets your heart racing?<br>  You'll need a pretty strong displacement activity to do alone. People have tried things of a sexual nature or otherwise risky in order to blot out pain, but then have got hooked on these. So choose something that you know you can control but can do alone but still grabs you.<br>  Plan it well & enjoy & it will help you get over your grief & settle in well to your new home.|`|C3ab0mHBaa	Whilst a fresh start may help in the short term, it won't help with your real problems. To not have to worry about paying a mortgage is good, living by the sea must be pretty cool but the real problem you have is you have lost your parents whom, I am surmising were probably the one constant you've had in your life (like I have). A fresh start and a new place to live are really just papering over the cracks. You need to address the issues you have, I recommend counseling. Don't just brush off the suggestion saying you're not that bad etc. Depression is an illness that can be successfully treated (I know this for a fact). I suggest you contact an organization such as Relate who offer grief counseling. Best of luck|`|rchaTSI9aa	I am so sorry for your loss. <br>  It's hard loosing someone you love. I'm sure moving will help you, but I don't make any promises. You're probably going to feel real crummy still, for a while. Just take one day, or one or two hours, at least, and just use that time to cry about them, and get all that out of your system. Then after you've calmed down, think about what more there is to life. Think about your parents, and how proud they are of you. All the positive stuff. Of course, you're still going to feel bad about it either way. My first hamster died after only 2 months of me owning her (long story), and she died at the end of December, and I still feel a sadness inside of me. Just make some new friends, while keeping your old ones, and hang out with them a bit more. It'll keep your mind entertained. You wouldn't want to go into depression for 5 years because you couldn't get your mind of this. That would really suck. But don't get me wrong, I really am sorry about your parents. So yeah, if you feel like crying, just cry. But in the next few months, or maybe the next year, make it your homework to recover from this sadness. <br>  <br>  Hope you get better. Good luck! ;)|`|4m4NRJJ1aa	Yes, its okay to be really sad after both of your parents died!<br>  And for sure that is a very good start. Good luck!<br>  Hang out with friends to have some fun!|`|RaNeOJw8aa	I'm really sorry to hear about your loss. Yes I think a fresh start will help you. Just try to remember that your parents wouldn't want to see you so sad. Talk to people about how you are feeling, I promise you will feel alot better once you have everything off your chest.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your fresh start xx|`|Mh0aQBcQaa	you need to keep busy-be occupied-find a new passion a hobby or an interset you may have -so somethng that you always wanted to do but kept putting off-do it now.time is a great healer-no one knows the meaning of life but one thing we have to come to terms with, we will all lose some of our nearest and dearest but would they want to see you unhappy or getting on with life?|`|3NjmcjfGaa	If you think its a fresh start fine.

Your weight and height sound normal and your period could just be delayed, it doesn't happen for everyone at or even near the same time. And no, weight rarely has anything to do with your period so I would not worry too much about it, just talk to the docs and don't worry so much, it isn't healthy to worry too much, it causes a lot of stress on the body and that is something that can cause problems later in life.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Adam-O|`|UnY8i6xmaa	Ok, that is normal if you have not yet started your period. It is not normal though if you don't start before 18. For being 16 and 85 lbs. It is not good, you can get a lot of nasty diseases. If you like to watch your weight it is a good thing. Maybe have breakfast, a snack, lunch, a very small snack, then dinner then maybe work out twice a week. If you don't take good care of your body you won't be able to start your period. It may be how low weighted you are.|`|kjAQj3i7aa	I'm sorry, but you are seriously underweight. Your BMI is 15. A few years ago, in a couple of major fashion events, models were banned if they had a BMI of under 18, which is considered too underweight. That is why you aren't having periods. You may think that the other girls at your school are the same size/weight as you, but they're not. Go to your doctor's appointment. You need help.|`|htBxuF28aa	really you dont need to worry about it it dosent sound like your weight is a problem at <br>  especially after reading your measurements you wear a A cup bra, and there is not much difference to your waist and hips also that you are short.....maybe you just havent finished/started puberty yet, this would also be a reason for not having your periods and your doctor will think the same. <br>  <br>  i dont think its due to your weight because at 5ft1 22inch waist isnt too small at all i have a 20 inch waist at 5ft6n i started periods at 12 :( !!!<br>  you can start periods at average of upto 19 years old....periods are horrible your lucky!
GBG2hbQ4aa	You are definitely a highly motivated gal... that comes with a price.  You invest so much of yourself in becoming the person you want to be, that your personal life hasn't had a chance to blossom.  I would guess that your studies alone take up a big hunk of your life.  Add work, and where do you find time to have fun, let alone find a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Truthfully, that can come later.  You have already made that observation.  It's not about being attractive.  It's about being out there where the guys are.  [Honestly, these days, seems like more and more folks are hooking up through dating services than who actually meet in the normal course of their lives.]<br>  <br>  That you are feeling bottled up (anxious?)   is a whole 'nuther deal.  A second guess on my part is that you probably don't take the best care of yourself.  You eat on the run, maybe skipping meals, certainly eating fast fare.   Diet can contribute a lot to your health (mental and physical)...or it can cost you dearly.  And dietary habits are cumulative...they add up, sometimes slowly, but picking up speed as your nutritional status deteriorates.<br>  <br>  Try tracking your diet for a while.  Make changes so that you are eating a healthy whole food diet.  Get away from processed foods totally.  They contain so many artificial ingredients, many of which are neurotoxic and can contribute greatly to mental symptoms such as anxiety, ADHD, depression, and more.   In addition to eating healthfully, take at least some basic supplements to make sure you are getting all the necessary nutrients on board.    <br>  <br>  That would include...<br>  *  a good multi-vitamin/mineral complex<br>  *   a B100 complex, taken daily, for at least three months.  Then drop back to a B50 for maintainance.<br>  *   a good EFA (essential fatty acid) formula...to be sure your nervous system (that includes your brain) is getting the right lipids to maintain health<br>  *   and last but not least, a good enzyme formula to be sure your body is able to digest and assimilate all the food and supplements you are getting.|`|b1sB4fuGaa	you need to get away from everything for a while.<br>  take some kind of vacation, not just for fun but for your own sanity, you really need it.<br>  it doesn't have to be an expensive vacation, just get away for awhile, anywhere. give yourself credit for what you do and every day know that all of that will someday be lifted from your shoulders.

It only becomes a phobia when it is severe.<br>  <br>  This may surprise you but most people have a degree of social anxiety at certain times, for example when in new places or when meeting new people.  It's just not to the extent that you have it.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me that the problem was actually there before you were 6. You were probably picked on because others singled you out as the weakest and possibly the most anxious, which made you an easy target. You need to work with a professional to get help and support on this and the first step is your GP.<br>  <br>  Another thought....strange as it might seem....have you thought about getting a dog (preferably something like a labrador) which would make you go out and support you whilst out? You might find that the dog would help you just as much as a psychologist.|`|Fi3esvFOaa	ooooooooooo|`|404dbf27fa7877e868281fc2f6fdff39aa	OK this sounds like it, though of course only a doctor can decide.<br>  And the two are the same thing- just to varying degrees.<br>  And my whole family ahs suffered from it.<br>  Guess waht?<br>  I was discovered to have hypertyhroid disorder, which contributes to all kinds of things like pressured, carzy speech (embarrassing), raised heart rate (panic attack city!), and other anxierty along with depression.<br>  The rest of my crazy family is like my Chrisitan Scientist great-grandmother and so never went ot the right doctors.<br>  The point is, I think all these skinny people have the thyroid disease, which runs in families, and I'm the only one who escaped it.<br>  And social anxiety can come about in many ways, phsically, emotionally, throught the faily etc.<br>  I am just about breaking out of it, too scared to get a new job I think, but in therapy.<br>  And trust me, if I can break out, after at least 14 years hormonally almost bi-polar as well as socially anxious, then you can, too.<br>  Go to an MD, a general doctor, or if no blood tests are ordered, a psychiatrist who will order the blood tests.<br>  And then see what help you need from there!<br>  Good luck, hon, you can do it.|`|tSQLeTUGaa	It sounds to me like you're suffering from quite severe social anxiety. I would suggest that you book an appointment with your GP, explain your difficulties and ask to be referred to a psychiatrist. From what you've written, it's likely that you'll then be referred to a clinical psychologist, whilst the psychiatrist will most likely advise you to take an SSRI antidepressant, such as escitalopram, which will be issued by your GP. These medications will not "cure" you, but can ameliorate the worst of your symptoms.
73AJvAPWaa	Darkening in color and some slight swelling can be a normal occurance during puberty as your body's changing. (The same thing can happen with a boy's scrotum as the labia and scrotum grow from the same embryonic tissue). Just keep an eye on it and as long as there's no pain you should be okay.|`|htBHCNDtaa	Ok, well I don't think he'd be repulsed and I don't think he'd sit there staring and studying every detail about it.<br>  <br>  Sometimes one labia can be bigger than the other, maybe even double in size, so that's normal. I'm not sure if you mean it's a bit purple or extremely purple and extremely noticeable.<br>  <br>  Either way, you could go to your doctor and discuss your concerns. Tell him one labia is this way and it doesn't look like the other. He/she will not look, but if they do think something is a bit strange he/she will refer you to a gynecologist. Don't be alarmed either way, if he/she sends you, it doesn't mean anything is wrong, it's just to make sure your ok and besides a gyno has seen THOUSANDS of vagina's in every size, shape and colour.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

lV4trHW1aa	Yeah, being on the pill will do that. I've been on the pill for almost 12 years, so I have been through it all. I've been through lateness, thinking I'm pregnant because symptoms are similar, etc. But to answer your questions, mine has dwindled down to a light to regular in flow and only lasting a few days (typically 2-3 days). My doctor has told me that is quite normal, even for someone on it that long.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|VTJv0Sxdaa	i know im not a woman but i have had 5 children ,  my wife was on the birth control pill when she got pregnant with our 3rd child  but it was caused by being on anti biotics.  i know when she started the pill her whole period changed and there was not much blood but some of the same systems. so if i was you i would not worry,  take care david

dpgXzMenaa	There are only two ways exercise can affect menstruation:<br>  <br>  1) if you exercise a *lot* and don't eat enough, eventually you'll lose so much body fat that your reproductive system will shut down to prevent you killing yoursrelf by getting pregnant<br>  <br>  2) keeping your body toned and healthy (good diet is part of this) will make everything about you - including your periods - work better and more reliably.<br>  <br>  That's it... except for the fact that *some* women find that light exercise (especially if they're already in good shape) helps lighten menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  50 sit ups per day is *nothing*, and will only make your abs and obliques better toned and keep your belly flat - it *won't* affect your period.   If this is a *sudden* change in your activity, it might delay ytour period a few days just liike *any* new stress can.|`|nioQRjnYaa	Exercise can affect your period- Generally, it takes more rigorous exercise in combination with a lower calorie diet that can lead to lack of menstruation. Depending on how regular your cycle is, and your specific body, more or less exercise may affect you in that way. If you are worried, you should probably just double check with your physician. <br>  Better be safe than sorry!|`|BK535teoaa	Depending on when you are suppose to get your cycle, and if your body is use to a lot of exercise, it can have an effect on your period. When I started doing swimming a few years ago, we had long hard practices, and I skipped my period for a month. However, that doesn't happen with everyone. Exercise is said to also help with cramps and all that.|`|IsNSNHsYaa	i don't think doing sit ups or anything like that will affect your period other than cramp which may be less Intense. however i know that if you go from little activity to a lot then that can really delay your period. for me i play soccer and softball, but in feb i begun training to run a 10k and my period was so messed up it came like 42 days from the previous one. but it all depends on your body i guess!<br>  hope this helped! :)|`|U8kLyWS1aa	yes it slows it down while working out.|`|9TyrKyK6aa	It will probably slow down while working out.<br>  Cramps might feel better after as well.
AA10358331	No.. for some people it can help them sleep faster and better.
MF9YknDYaa	Not much,the 1400 calories is too small for your body to benefit from all the exercise,sooner or later your body will get ill and then you can't exercise and your body will be in starvation mode and then you gain lots of fat.
AA11476749	You can lose the weight within the time frame you've set for yourself.  It will require dedication and hard work, but can be done.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you avoid diet soda.  It contains a high amount of sodium, which causes water retention.  Plus, the artificial sweeteners aren't all that good for you.<br>  <br>  Begin by eating smaller portions, and using proper nutrition.  Avoid the sweets, bad carbs (such as breads, pastas) and eat the good carbs (fruits and vegetables)  Eat more protein and less fat (this can be achieved by eating more poultry and fish versus red meats).  Also avoid fast food which is high in fat, sodium, and calories.<br>  <br>  Next, exercise at least 30 minutes a day.  Even a brisk walk is better than nothing.  When you hit a plateau with your weight, increase your activity level.  Motion is your friend.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VmQsGfrEaa	Why drink diet pop? It has chemicals and is still bad for you.

3sriJtSkaa	I know you said that you will go see someone but I just want to be clear that nothing that anybody on here says is really valid. we a re all just random people on the internet and while it's important to talk this stuff out, you need to see a professional. <br>  <br>  It sounds like these sensations are a sort of loss of contact with reality. I  am not a mental health professional but to me it sounds like you are not completely in control of your thoughts, and it's good that you are able to realize that something you are thinking is not reality (IE; that blood wasn't actually dripping on you and it was just in your mind) but this indicates that something is slightly off and could continue to worsen to the point where perhaps you won't have as clear a voice in your head saying "that's not real". <br>  In my opinion (again, not a professional) you should listen clearly to the part of yourself that tells you to be skeptical, that tells you to ask for proof of what you are thinking. For example, if the blood thing were to happen again, first take control of your thoughts, analyze the situation and consider why the thing you are thinking is highly unlikely and then finally once you have contol of your mind, just turn on the light and look and you'll see that you're right.|`|oKwXjVolaa	It could be an form of bipolar disorder or something similar to that if you're hallucinating often. The question to ask yourself about these is, are you aware of the hallucinations or just can't make them stop, or do you think it's real life and you're utterly convinced? Determining HOW you're hallucinating is helpful, as crazy as that sounds.<br>  As far as the slow motion and spacing out, that could be something else more explainable. Are you stressed about something? Have you had any major change in your life? Hormonal problems or imbalances? It could be anything, since it doesn't sound like any specific mental disorder.<br>  If it's really bugging you, go see a psychiatrist about it, or get someone else to talk to, because maybe that's all you need.|`|5NRu0hQcaa	i wish i could hang out with you.|`|87Ua8oUaaa	I had a weird  experience like that last week and that got me thinking a lot too.

mW2HP40Raa	well theres only one way to find out--the test you took. but if you want my opinion, i think that if you have copious amounts of discharge, then its more likely to be chlamydia.<br>  <br>  however both chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis are bacterial infections and when theres a smell, theres always bacteria. so the smell could be indicative of either type infection.<br>  <br>  just remember, either way, you can cure the infection and get back to normal. and condomize to prevent chlamydia and any number of other bacterial and viral infections. good luck!|`|tSi10jneaa	Well why are you worrying when you have already given a test for it and waiting for it's results.<br>  Just calm down and see your results if they are positive/negative visit a doctor to find out more.|`|hlYZeY4vaa	It could be just an excess of discharge. I had the same thing and was tested for chlamydia. Everything was normal.

I am a 38 DD and I hate it. When I finally got the courage to wear a bikini, it took me like 7 stores in 3 different cities. I wear baggy sweatshirts, because I feel like a piece of meat every time I wear something remotely form fitting. I can barely make it through a conversation without someone glancing at my chest. I hate it. The last time I put on my bikini and went to a water park, I got dirty looks from a few people, because my chest got a little larger and my bikini no longer fit me. I didn't have the 40 bucks (you have to pay more for something that's hard to find, I got mine at a specialty swimwear store) to get another swimsuit. I can't even feel human when I wear a normal tank top, because there is always someone staring at my chest. It's not the kind of attention you want. Getting attention for  your personality and getting attention for having a large chest are two very different types of attention. The only kind of guy's attention I seem to get are the creepy ones who'd rather stare at my chest than look me in the eye. You are perfectly fine the way you are.|`|AA10201252	well im sorry for answering while im a male but there is 1 thing im damn sure about it , which is there is NO such product contains a 100% herbs , it must contain chemicals in a very indirect way so u cant sue them , OR , it really contains natural herbs but does NOTHING , take my word for it and keep ur breast size as it is , im sure someone will like u the way u r now <br>  <br>  better safe than sorry

Your metabolism burns about 2,000 calories a day . Take 500 calories out of 2,000 . That's 1,500 eat that much and try to work out eat day for about an hour . You will lose some weight it will take some time though. Good luck.|`|otsuH97Jaa	I feel so bad, and I wish there was a better answer, but really... Diet and exercise. Eat protein! Lots of protein! ( Chicken, turkey, fish etc. ) and then lift some weights. Focus on your arms for a day, then your legs. Do crunches every day and NEVER SKIP A DAY OF EXERCISE! =P I promise it works.|`|eNPcNGSjaa	It's called "exercise" and "eating a well-balanced diet".|`|18hRm0gLaa	Well exercise more and eat healthier and i know its a cliche but it works|`|z7Jj2gFHaa	You have to eat a light breakfest. People who eat breakfast are on average quite a bit skinnier than those who dont. It is about your bodies ability to metabolize food. Whatever amount of food you eat you should spread out throughout the day so your body uses it rather than storing it as fat. One of the easiest and most succusful diets if your interested is the Adkins diet. All you have to do is quit eating sugar and eat less bread and pasta. If you do that you can eat as much protein rich foods as you like such as cheese, eggs and meat. My mother and cousin lost a bunch of weight on this diet because protein does't become fat like sugars and carbohdrates which go straight to your butt.

I wouldn’t try weights though as your 14 and you’re still growing or if you want to tone up use light weights.<br>  You could even just go jogging. <br>  I was incredibly unfit and I joined a five a side team and played indoors and it helped me a lot although any sport really would be good.<br>  Really it is just good diet and hard work just be careful not to overdo it.|`|PoWNBIDUaa	Dude, surprisingly or not, you are skinny. I am 14 too and weigh 155, although I do workout everyday and its muscle. But people have different body types, and fat they cannot ever get rid of, its simply genetics. You are at a healthy weight, i would not ruin it. If I was you, I would just consider eating healthily, like NO SOFT DRINKS, NO DESERTS, read labels and lower fat and cholesterol. Run and do interval training, do some weight lifting for tone. But do not stop eating, as long as u cut out bad foods and purify your body along with exercise, you will be happy. Trust me.

Fqh6SFMpaa	Yes, our blood sugar shoots up after a meal but it has to go down below 120 mg/dl after 2 hours or else you might have an Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and might develop Diabetes later on if your sugar level keeps on way above the limit just mentioned after eating (post-prandial).|`|jpA71Js1aa	if you are not a diabetic then your blood sugar levels should never go over 120 no matter what you eat, if you have a working pancreas your body will automatically adjust insulin levels within you to keep your blood sugar levels under that number, if they are going above that number that means your pancreas is not functioning at 100% and  there is a good chance you are headed down a road towards diabetes, so i would keep an eye on it and get in to see your doctor, they can do a test called an A1c test which tells the average of your blood sugar levels over the last 8 wks or so and that is usually a good indicator of whether you are in danger of having diabetes or if you do have it|`|2qPtGTNcaa	It depends on how high. Normal fasting (before breakfast) blood sugar is 70 to 99 mg/L. Two hours after eating, it should not exceed 120. If you are near the top of those limits, try drinking chamomile tea.

38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	I am Bipolar and I am not off of my medications.What I can tell you is that Bipolar is not curable.It's treatable.Medications do not cure  but they help by treating this disorder and symptoms.However,there are other ways to care for it.Through the years I was diagnosed with Bipolar I actually found ways to control mood swings.My mood swings are not as bad as before. A few ways is yes a good diet does help including fried foods.Like anything else be cautious but not a lot.I also find that exercise as well as spirituality helps a lot on the way you think.Try reading this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.bipolar-lives.com/bipolar-diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bipolar-lives.com/bipolar-die...</a>|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	I'm bipolar, and pretty much everyone else in my family is. <br>  <br>  I know you're not going to like this answer, but medication is the only real way to manage bipolar disorder. A healthy diet is always a good thing and frequent exercise can help the moods due to the adrenaline rush, but bipolar disorder is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. No vitamin or natural remedy has been shown to reliably do anything for that chemical imbalance, and it can only be properly treated by taking medication.<br>  <br>  If your daughter is happy and doing well, I strongly encourage you NOT to take her off of her medication, especially without the help of a doctor as stopping most bipolar medications abruptly can lead to psychical and mental side effects.|`|AA10563860	Not sure why you waited 4 years to ask these question.  There is nothing in a vitamin or other supplement that will affect her brain as quickly as the meds...and although fish oils, co-enzyme Q-10, inositol/choline, phosphatidyl choline, and others can be helpfull...it is likely she would not use them now as she likely will not "feel them kick in".<br>  Improved diet, improved sleep, and exercise are also quite helpfull with any and all nervous system conditions.<br>  The ups and downs of bipolar are typically caused by ineffiecient neuronal activity of her brain.|`|DsEEATKSaa	Unfortunately, there are no "natural" treatments for bipolar disorder.<br>  <br>  Do not be fooled by websites reporting that this is possible.<br>  <br>  It is not.<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder is not curable, but it IS treatable.

Carrots, celery, apples, bananas, peaches... Anything in that category, really ^__^.<br>  <br>  Usually, you'll want to avoid dressings that go with veggies, though.

Go to a pharmacy or drug store, you can find many acne treatments there.|`|W4HNrbXvaa	Many of the main companies for skin care have a spot treatment.

It dries the zit out and its cheaper<br>  <br>  -hope this helps :]|`|B19ht03Jaa	get a wash cloth and put water on as hot as it can go. then get the washcloth soaked and put it on your nose. when it starts to cool do it over again. trust me it takes the swelling down and people can barely tell.|`|nVeGysnSaa	Well whenever I see A pimple coming on.

Don't use these products of facial wash too much, that can back fire and cause more terrible pimples. Clearasil also recently came out with a new product which you use when you feel the pimple but before it comes up, I'm not sure if it works or not.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I can't stand when I start breaking out!|`|WtdY9WIsaa	it's probably too late to stop it. put toothpaste on it and let it dry on it. then wash it off when it's completely dry. your goal is just to dry it out as much as you possibly can. if you can go to a store, grab benzoyl peroxide ointment (clean and clear, or neutrogena, or clearasil)|`|jTmMzolAaa	Do not pop it or touch it or anything. Just get a warm wet towel and lay it on your nose. It should relieve it and take your stress away (stress sometimes causes pimples). Try that and wash your face every morning and night.

If it becomes an issue, discuss it with your doctor for a diagnosis of the cause.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|AA10034285	Yes. This sometimes happens. Don't let it worry you.<br>  <br>  If it keeps happening, make a note of the details (dates and times of the beginning and end of your normal flow and of this extra flow) and any other symptoms like unusual tiredness or any pain or discomfort you are experiencing, then go and see your doctor and show him or her your notes.

xMlL7CKcaa	Although the prostate was first described by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in 1536, and illustrated by Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853.[136] Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction.[137] Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital.[138] Surgical removal of the testes (orchiectomy) to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, but with limited success. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction in the middle of the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh.[139] This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.
H8WqMK1eaa	I doubt it.<br>  <br>  Most viruses won't survive...and I seriously doubt bacteria would either...at least not the type to cause an infection unless you had a severe immune deficiency or something.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I wouldn't worry about it.  Do you know how many times little kids peel that crap off the bottom of restaurant tables and chew it before their parents make them spit it out?
W5U0PyNeaa	Easy answer but gotta have a strong motivation!<br>  <br>  It's no magic, just logic.<br>  <br>  Eat healthy and exercise daily.<br>  <br>  I'm in a healthy weight range too but I'm not aiming "average" body.  I'm aiming toned healthy sexy body!!  I want a hot body and it's non of the other people's business that I should be content with my average body just because they are.<br>  <br>  I do agree with above comment about your body "not being destroyed" after child birth.  I know so many who still looks toned after pregnancy.  Admit that you hadn't been exercising and start get into it!  It's never too late.<br>  <br>  If you want flab free body, exercise an hour a day and eat healthy meals consisting loads of vegetables.  Your bra should be soaked in sweat after exercise.  I do that 6 days a week and for the first time in my life, I'm starting to see tones in my body :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!! You can do it!|`|XGHLrOklaa	First off I don't believe your body is "destroyed" after kids I've had two and mine hasn't been.  I still have loads of muscle.  But to lose flab you have to do cardio and weights.  Diet pills and diet will not help with extra flab.  It's that easy.  Just do 30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of weights a day and you should start seeing results.|`|Xtuoxblfaa	Learn how to drop 10 lbs fast and easy <br>  with no exercises, pills, potions or lotions..|`|JYHlPczxaa	First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/</a>  <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/." rel="nofollow">http://thefatlosssecret.blogspot.com/.</a><br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|ifIRySXpaa	I've never had children before, but I've heard of the certain type of weight that's hard to get rid of after having children. Please reconsider taking diet pills and trying out all the newest diet fads. Practically all of them are fake, don't do you any good financially or health wise, and the diets are mostly fueled by a very simple equation of not eating more calories than your body needs everyday, but most of them have it all wrong! Eating low-fat food this and that or things like the atkins diet... Just stay away from it! (Like the first two respones you got, from pablo and mylee; I've been seeing those paragraphs word for word but from all kinds of different users, through yahoo too, they're just trying to make money and taking advantage of tv spotlights of certain moment fad foods and products and people desperate to lose some pounds) You'll thank yourself later. The most important and smart thing you can do for your body is to EAT REAL FOOD. If you eat Real food, in moderation, in season, slowly and chew your food properly, and stay active, you'll lose excess water weight, you'll feel and look better, you may lose all those annoying headaches and cravings, and you'll feel very satisfied for the choices you make. I know I do, I've never felt better, I'm glad I realized I had to change my diet and start the journey to healthier eating now while I'm still in my early twenties.<br>  <br>  Many people in this day and age consider the "normal" diet to be, normal. Healthy too. I find it hard to believe that chugging down hundreds of chemicals, sweeteners, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, sodium, sugar, and refined and bleached products, in increasingly larger super sizes, is "normal". Many products make health claims but most are misleading and sometimes downright false. DO SOME RESEARCH, and READ THE LABELS, it'll open your eyes. You might already be aware that, as sad as it is, many food product and medical drug companies care more about making money than their customer's health. And so you find all these "low-fat" "healthy" "foods" in the aisles, loaded with sweeteners and chemicals, waiting to be zapped in a microwave. Take a tour Around the aisles, the less popular but most important place, the walls of the building, where you'll find produce, like fruits and vegetables. Go in the aisles for whole grains and spices without addictives. Two good rules of thumb: If you can't pronounce it, don't eat it. The less ingredients, the better.<br>  <br>  Buying organic, local and in season foods is the best thing to do for you, your neighborhood and the environment, but sometimes that variety is very slim and/or expensive, depending on where you live. In that case, you can grow a garden, if you're a rather busy person, it can be just a little one, or just a couple of plants of veggies and herbs even. Be independent, and be more in control of what you eat and feed your kids. Making your own food is very important, you can control what types of ingredients you use and the portions you make. I came across a wonderful website two months ago <a href="http://whfoods.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://whfoods.org/index.html</a> it speaks of very healthy, easily accessible and tasty real foods and their nutrients, how to cook them and how to get the most out of them. There is SO much information on there, also there's a Food Advisor, which can help you figure out what nutrients you might be deficient in and how to replenish them. And many recipes, super easy and quick meals you can make... I've made a few of the recipes so far and they've been fabulous, my husband raves about them all the time!<br>  <br>  I've got many tips on how to eat healthier and make smart food choices on my blog <a href="http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/</a> as well as a bunch of healthy recipes, I'm sure you'll find some useful information there! Let me know if you have any more questions, I'll be glad to help out =) Good luck! You seems to already have the right spirit for it, it doesn't seem like you take crap from anyone hehe.
JbbfVyVGaa	giving you artheritis is a myth actually.<br>  i do crack my knuckles if i get hand cramps from writing or after ive been driving for awhile...it loosesns them up. otherwise i dont. it's not bad its really just a myth that it is and a lot of people still believe that....<br>  <br>  oh and no i dont know anyone whose hands hurt because of it, but if yours start to hurt  then you should probably try to stop at least for a little while.|`|i4Zg3XsQaa	it isn't so bad although you can suffer tissue damage from it. <br>  it supposedly relaxes you and makes you more flexible<br>  and all of those comments saying it gives you arthritis are all hogwash<br>  and yes it does hurt sometimes when you crack them really hard but it relaxes you for lets say a test or anything that gets you anxious.|`|16f1cfb6e07b0f33d82cd068111a6abaaa	I was always told it causes arthritis. I used to do it when I was a child but I haven't done it on a regular basis in years. I would'nt be surprised if after years and years of doing it you may get arthritis. I rather be safe than sorry. But when you think about it it's pointless. I did it all the time really for no reason just cause I thought my knuckles needed to be popped. And I haven't done it in years and my hands feel fine and I type every day for work. So it's kinda a pointless habit.|`|n4IOpH2Baa	ive heard some physicians say that when u pop ur knuckles that fluid goes into ur joints and can make them stiff later in life and ive heard that it can make ur joints stronger too. not sure which to believe but i crack my knuckles quite alot, nothing wrong with my joints YET, but im sure those loud cracking noises cant be good but it feels good so i keep doin it haha. in my opinion, it will do minor damage that only has a CHANCE of affecting you later in life|`|QwYfHol4aa	The athletic trainer at my school said that cracking your knuckles will not do anything to you. He said that it is just a release of air.|`|rHK7TFitaa	ive been cracking my neck for about 6 months now, already some slight discomfort. cracking your knuckles leads to arthritis|`|7CO8JoMdaa	i do it all the time! i do not think its bad|`|FAlZFYwnaa	I don't think its bad, but my friend says it'll give you arthritis.|`|p1J1YGyRaa	first of all I personally dont think there is a problem with it other than it irritates some people ( not me! i do it)  my aunt is a doctor and she said that it cannot give you artheritis or any other thing like people warn you about so dont worry =)|`|tL5vlITcaa	I don't think so.<br>  <br>  I may be wrong though.<br>  <br>  But still, it annoys people, and I will keep doing it.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	It breaks water sacks in your hands that lubricate your knuckles. Eventually when you are older no more lubrication and you get arthritis.|`|OWKJTU6kaa	I hate when people do it, it grosses me out. I hear it can give you arthritis because of hurting the bone from popping it. Don't do it, it is a major turn off (in my opinion, anyway.)|`|256891400379bbbbbce12396d37ae520aa	i do not think so as long as it is not done to often but it may be annoying to some people whole has to listen to it.|`|MmfsXkWlaa	I don't do it and I personally don't think of it as bad for your hands.|`|qesPG9ufaa	yes i think it causes atheritis
11YKVOQEaa	ok i usually cut weight before weigh ins too. it should be okay to cut 9 pounds. eat small meals and celery lol. and u can go crazy on liquids lol, that wont affect ur weight. and the day of the tounrmanet weigh in, dont eat anything and mix lemon juice with waterever fluid you drink because it will go right through you. if you weigh slightly too much for the weigh in, do 10 laps around a baseball field and wear lots of clothes which should help u lose half a kilo.|`|76iuxeLWaa	I used to cut weight for wrestling and still have to cut a little for MMA. Its not the most fun thing but I dont think it will harm you as long as your careful to not get to dehydrated. Another tip is stay away from foods with alot of salt and dont salt your food.
jdfu6thnaa	you just have to change the way you are trying to lose weight. i wouldnt say you need to see anyone right now, but please please please change your habits right away.<br>  <br>  plan out meals and try to get 1200 calories a day. if you are that worried cut out fatty foods and junk, pop, candy. if you follow a fairly strict diet of 1200 cal/day and get regular exercise you can lose 2 pounds a week.<br>  <br>  please be safe and not stupid|`|6e0PG4YWaa	You have some symptoms of an eating disorder, kind of a mix between  anorexia and binge eating.  I would recommend that you take a look at this site, <a href="http://www.eatingdisorder.com/eating-disorders-help.html?utm_source=ans&utm_medium=pv&utm_campaign=rcx." rel="nofollow">http://www.eatingdisorder.com/eating-dis...</a>  I think that you will find a lot of useful information on there, and also helpful information.  <br>  <br>  Another suggestion that I'm going to make is that you call the toll-free helpline number on the site, because I think that you should speak to a professional counselor who works in the field.  Reason being that they will give you the best insight into this issue, more so than we can.  Good luck, best wishes.|`|NvGqiA4vaa	it definitely sounds like it is progressing towards an ED, that is now mine started.<br>  <br>  do NOT use syrup of ipecac however... that can be VERY damaging if used inappropriately (which is how you're planning on using it). it can destroy your heart. it is bad bad bad.
pcS73lKGaa	Just be mindful of wait u eat. You should eat between 1500 to 1750 calories per day.  Watch ur carb intake.  Doing short bursts of high intensity cardio burns more fat than running or jogging for a long period of time. Like run as fast as u can for 20 to 30 sec and then walk for a min and repeat for ten min.  <br>  <br>  P.s. girls shoulders to waist ratio is about .9, so ur waist is going to be like 90 % of shoulder's width.|`|pVJJ9R85aa	if you look anything like the first one. I think your completely fine.|`|sTTzXCsgaa	"You can't get your body to look like the second one." This is a possibility ... I know your not a model but just because you have seen it in real life does not mean that you have the same body type as that person.  You may just have wide hips.  But the first girls stomach/waist area is very attractive, so if you look anything like that, I am sure you are fine.<br>  <br>  If you would like to lose weight stay away from simple carbs and sugar.  Also avoid processed foods if at all possible.  Other than that just moderate what you eat and keep up the cardio.|`|n54adPiBaa	Exercise, situps chin ups etc.|`|AMerE42Taa	Try doing some side bends and sit ups
AA12212523	The hospital social worker should be able to put you in touch with local services to fix the house for access, and arrange nursing services.
tIldpr7vaa	cardio is much better for losing fat, go jogging.<br>  <br>  pushups dont do much for fast loss or muscle gain|`|fPbjSNEHaa	Doing push ups uses only your own body as resistance, if you find you can do 200 per day quite easy, you have good musuclar endurance which is a great start, but there is only so much you can achieve. <br>  <br>  If you want to get into shapes you need to up the resistance ... do pushups with a weight belt otherwise go to a gym and do strength resistance training with barbells such as the bench press.
kVLZTeQraa	You should buy a nit (fine tooth) comb to check yourself over for lice. <br>  It could just be a psychological thing, you think you have head lice when you don't. <br>  <br>  It may also be something completely different, you might have reacted to the shampoo/conditioner/hair product you've been using recently, or dandruff so use an anti-dandruff shampoo for sensitive skin if that is the case.<br>  <br>  There are probably another million and one reasons for an itchy head but the most common at lice and dandruff. <br>  If you're worried, check here;<br>  <a href="http://www.visualdxhealth.com/diseaseGroups/itchyScalpNeck.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.visualdxhealth.com/diseaseGro...</a>|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	It might just be your imagination because you sister had them. But you also could have got them from her. They are very contagious.|`|sBh8U18yaa	GIVE IT TIME.. AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO INCH HAVE SOME ONE CHECK YOU HEAD FOR LICE AGAIN . IF NO LICE STILL ITS ASIGHN OF A SENSITIVE SCALP
AA10640653	Most ladies would be able to handle an average sized member of 5" - 6 1/2"  easily and depending on how excited she is can actually expand to accept something as large as 10" in length.|`|ccmax0yQaa	3/4th of the length....
0didTstUaa	yeah it is. i dont suppose there is a normal so no worries. if you really feel that bad about it, ask your doctor to take a body fat index measurment, and see what areas the fat is concentrated in, (if there are any)<br>  most people think their stomach isnt as flat as it should be, myself as one.<br>  if you want a flatter stomach though, try a few sit ups every day until you feel comfortable, but dont rush anything.<br>  any more questions my email is<br>  soulstealer423@rock.com<br>  hope this helped<br>  good day ;)
nrTVlo8Eaa	ADHD is so common and so easy to diagnose that you won't have any trouble looking it up and understanding the description of it.|`|kivwSfpgaa	i have the same problem. i have been on the same math problem for 2 hours.

CCnej03qaa	I am sorry that is happening to you guys! All the best luck to you both, I don't think he cheated. :)<br>  "Common modes of transmission of HPV include sexual contact and any type of skin-to-skin contact. Human papilloma virus infection can also be transmitted during childbirth. It has been proven that HPV can be recovered from fingernail brushings and therefore could be transmitted by shaking hands."|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	HPV spreads from SKIN TO SKIN CONTACT. The confusion could lie in the fact that many people only call "sex", vaginal intercourse. They may not include things like fondling ( touching the other persons penis or vagina), foreplay. <br>  <br>  For example: I was molested when the attacker toucheds his penis and then grabbed my vagina. The HPV spread from his penis skin to my vagina skin.<br>  <br>  I think many people may fondle each other...for example a guy fingers a girl then masterbates a little.....the virus then spreads from skin to skin. <br>  <br>  Maybe your husband didn't have intercourse before you but did some other skin to skin sexual foreplay.|`|LXfqKCxTaa	Human Papaloma Virus can be given to people by people who have never had sex before. he probly didnt cheat on you|`|zwJPFdUaaa	LOL OWNED
YwHl37Hgaa	If you have an oily skin wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the pimples like soap.The secret of keeping the skin clear is to keep it oil-free and clean. If you have a dry skin honey is a great remedy for acne and pimples because the honey kills bacteria. If you have a combination skin when you wash your face, use sugar to scrub it, at least once a day, for two weeks to rid yourself of acne.Try  <a href="http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/</a> for more info.|`|I814g6ZBaa	The absolute BEST COMBO I've use (for myself & my daughters) is a scrub 2x/daily with salicylic acid followed by a lotion with benzoyl peroxide.  Neutrogena has a good kit -- it also has a moisturizer -- but you could put together your own products.  <br>  Just make sure you get those two treatments; hands down, they beat ANY scrip med we've had from the dermo, and we've had these:<br>  Taz (2 strengths)<br>  Clindagel<br>  Differen<br>  <br>  Good Luck, Sweetie!!|`|2qPtGTNcaa	No joke, I used lemon juice. It kills the bacteria that causes acne.
iPQqPkhTaa	go to a clinic. ignore the dork who said you shouldnt because you took illegal drugs. a doctor doesnt care and wont call the police. their only concern is getting you better.|`|8HyQOgg5aa	It sounds like it could have been, I don't think people would continuously borrow your water - its quite strange. Also, the asian guy sounds like he was up to something suspicious. Sorry but it sounds like your drink could have been spiked. I'm not sure what the drug could have been.|`|utYi5HVUaa	Raves are awesome to go to,i been to a few of them(Probably about 7)<br>  The first rave i ever been to was crazy,i thought i had my drink spiked without noticing.I got suspicous and paranoid about it.By the time i went home I waited for taxi while some guy was following us.(This guy i seen at the rave while i was dancing,he was about 17?) Me and my friend started to walk faster and he followed.Luckily this asian guy 16,17? noticed and walk towards the stalker and pushed him away,I dont know what happened after but i was happy he was gone.Now back to your drink,if you think you been spiked,it is not a good idea to go to a clinic especially when u done some illegal drugs.I have always been clean so the best thing to do is stay clean now that you have learned.Next time you take E,think about the risk.|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	you should go to a clinic and check<br>  <br>  if you dont and when you get your blood tested for something people start to get suspicious. if you right away show that it wasnt your fault and look innocent upon the people, they wouldnt suspect you and the police or the goverment wouldnt be invovled at all.<br>  <br>  best go to the clinic as soon as possible<br>  tomorrow even|`|yDGwCH3Waa	Acid?<br>  I would advise you NOT to go to the health clinic. You've done illegal drugs.<br>  If you're okay now, then just deal. If you're not, then I guess you don't have a choice, but I highly suggest you not to go.
lTxeGDfgaa	No actually it's probably healthier than the average teen's day, but coffee isn't so great for you, although I love it.  Also, try to add more veggies (like carrots, not really corn it's mostly starch) and meats into your diet unless you are a vegetarian.  Don't overdo the wheat or dairy 'cause it's not too good for you:)<br>  Hope this helps!|`|Y5ZtHbohaa	if you are 13 and weigh 85 pounds that is not good you should probably eat a little bit more often and more fattening foods such as...<br>  -breakfast- some cereal, coffee, and some granola which would be good<br>  -lunch- some chicken, fruits of choice, and some chips or pretzels<br>  -snack- snack packs of goldfish or any snack you like but i have those every day and they are 140 calories (go with those), fruits/vegetables<br>  -dinner- spaghetti and meatballs, or meatloaf and potatoes, and you could also have for dinner on occasions salad,<br>  i hoped i helped! :)|`|4XRKoGDWaa	normal body mass index is 18.5 to 24.9. 5'1 and 85lbs makes your bmi 16.1. you're underweight which is really quite bad for you. increase the ammount you eat|`|PTKiTblZaa	its okayy|`|BzdpL4mOaa	You shouldn't eat so many pretselz  but stick with the srawberries same with the salad that is really good for you.You should also try popcorn no butter!|`|iN8B01EXaa	geeezzz...if you didnt think it was weird then why did you ask..u should eat more.|`|AA12212403	You need protein in the mornings to keep you going and something more substantial at lunchtime.<br>  Do you like cheese or peanut butter?<br>  Your dinner sounds OK to me, though.<br>  But, you need some grains vs. unhealthy white flour products like pretzels.  What about a granola bar or cereal?|`|70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	You need more calories and more protein. So for breakfast you could add scramble eggs and toast. For lunch you could add a turkey sandwich with your grapes and pretzels and for snack you could add some cheese and crackers with your strawberries, the dinner is fine I would suggest you use vinaigrette dressing instead of low fat or fat free dressing.
QtObwfrFaa	Even though you were mean to me in my question.I will answer yours. What you have to do is go to the nurse tomorrow and explain what happened.ALso show her your knee and she will most likely write a note to leave class early so you will be on time for your next class. ALso for tonight RICE it..Rest it ,Ice it,Put compression on it,and Elevate it|`|ACMPEzqQaa	You do not unless you are very familiar with this process. <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Speed-healing-of-trauma-injuries-through-self-directed-regeneration" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Speed-healing-of...</a>|`|obE9Md17aa	use a magic spell on it|`|nXUSGZzpaa	Ok healing your knee is just about impossible to do in one night. However the best thing for you to do is of course REST. Elevate you injured leg by placing a pillow or two under your hurt knee, I also recommend placing ice on your knee for 10-20 min. every hour to help reduce swelling. The liquid you feel in your knee is probably just blood (swelling) and it happens to everyone so just elevate you leg and ice it to stop the swelling and don't do a lot of walking or running unless you absolutely have to. And I would also recommend some ibeprophen or aleve for any pain you might have and if you are still in great pain tomorrow go see your doctor
Vz4ooIxMaa	I'm not quite sure what you mean.  You can evaluate cardiorespiratory endurance by doing a timed mile run.  Or if it is available you can do the 'beep test'.  There are other ways, like step up tests where you go up and down on a step for a set amount of time, or biking tests, etc.
Z8qBgv8taa	Try and get out more. Socialize. Go places that you enjoy though. Otherwise you will meet someone who isn't into the same things you are. <br>  I honestly believe that love shows up when you are not looking for it. So maybe you should concentrate on school or work, or whatever else is keeping you busy. Spend time with your friends and enjoy being single. Let love find you...it will<br>  Stop looking for a bf....I've always believed that men can smell desperation a mile off...and therefore take advantage of you more easily.<br>  until you're totally comfortable with yourself on your own then how can you expect someone else to be comfortable with you?<br>  <br>  As for finding one just relax, socialise, act confident and smiley (even if you don't feel it) and be yourself. It'll happen, but like everything else, it takes time.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Just relax. The time will come.

I think one has brompheniramine and pseudoephedrine, and the other has chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine. <br>  Levsin is used usually to treat stomach cramps and colic.

lcuxD3qlaa	You definitely can...please do not listen to that first ridiculous comment!<br>  <br>  I’m a Vegetarian and I’m super thin, and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll ...and I have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  I bareeeely work out ....and I’ve never had a belly, big thighs, or big butt SO Listen k? I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!? (Kosher aisle)<br>  Mott’s applesauce, no added sugar is one of my favorite things to eat too!<br>  You can find organic applesauce too which provide different flavors without added sugar<br>  All “no added sugar” products are phenomenal<br>  <br>  NOTE: BEEF, Oh my god -it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...it’s the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice is great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soups (especially the ones with very little sodium)<br>  <br>  Fruit is ALWAYS a great snack at night!<br>  <br>  Ok, that’s all I can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  (I know I went on a rampage here, but I honestly hope this helps!)<br>  <br>  xoxoxox|`|MF9YknDYaa	You can't

If you don't like cranberry juice you can go to any drug store and get cranberry pills in the med aisle.|`|jVGnfoa8aa	I have had brownish stuff come out before and it was just discharge that came out a couple days before my period. it could also be a urinary tract infection. If it has a sulfer smell and your having abdominal pains and sometimes it burns when you pee and your pee is really dark then I am guessing its a UTI which you need to drink some cranberry juice and water and call your docter and get some antibiotics I used cipro before and it clears up in three to seven days. I had uti's when I was pregnant for my son. <br>  If you've had unprotected sex with someone you can't trust then I would get a couple test done for std's. Usually you don't bleed or have brown discharge when your pregnant it's usually clear or a thin white mucus that comes out because of the cervix thinning out opening and closing then dropping trying to protect a possible pregnancy. But I've heard that some women who have been pregnant in the early stages have had some bleeding. I would get on the phone tomorrow and call doc or o.b.g.y.n and if you don't have niether go to a walk in clinic. Because if it's a infection or a std it could ruin your fallopian tubes and ovaries and it can cause you to have miscarriages or even not be able to make babies. Good luck!

If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|n6piwtxPaa	ok so you want to make sure that when you insert it nothing but the string is sticking out. if it is the first time wearing one it may feel uncomfortable the first couple of times. also try the slim fits or the ones that say teen on them cause they are easier to insert if your a first timer.<br>  i hope this helped and dont worry,|`|6kkZQv6saa	No you shouldn't be able to feel it. It will hurt less after more use. Some girls have a specific angle that they must insert the tampon in, but it varies on girl to girl. Also, you MUST be relaxed!!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :)|`|3NjmcjfGaa	Sounds like you didnt put it in far enough just try again

This is all assuming you have insurance and you want to use it.....and you probably do want to use it because an average counselor is anywhere from $60-$90/hr depending where you live and stuff.  If you use your insurance you'll be required to pay whatever the co-pay is.  Shouldn't be overly expensive....mine is like $20.  <br>  <br>  I hope all this helps, and good luck!|`|IHw2qUtcaa	If you have to ask whether to get counseling the answer more than likely is yes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj_Mp4XigXgNBCnI0CecIhjtxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309133207AAmwh1n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Z4tOmLvvaa	yes you should i bet it would make you have a better relation ship with your father.

Long hair is always girlie.  When your hair gets long (past your shoulders), cut it in layers.  Layers make long hair look beautiful.  Also don't wear baggy clothes or clothes that are too big.  Wear skirts, shorts, skorts, and tight jeans and cute blouses and cute shoes.  Also wear make up and pink stuff.  If people are still saying that you're a boy after you've done all this, then they are just trying to mess with you or piss you off or irritate you.  You don't need those kinds of people.  Tell them you don't need them and to get out of your face .. then stay away from them and find new friends.|`|TjkZqzwDaa	Is it because of the way you dress or present yourself to others, or are they friends just trying to mess with you? If it is the former, you can try different ways to dress up/present yourself - but only if you are interested in it as well - and not solely for the sake of pleasing others. <br>  <br>  If it is the latter, then maybe they are messing with you just to tease you, or because they like you? You can either not react to those taunts, or just go along with them - thereby making their efforts to piss you off go in vain.<br>  <br>  But if it really, truly hurts you, try talking to them about it. If they care about you, they will stop. Otherwise, you should not care about them, try to make new friends, and move on.<br>  <br>  Here are few tips to improve self esteem:<br>  <a href="http://www.self-improvement-advice.org/improving-self-esteem.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.self-improvement-advice.org/i...</a>|`|IhHZxvRAaa	Ignore them, eventually if you stop paying attention they'll get over it!<br>  And I bet you're beautiful from the inside and out :D<br>  So who cares what a hater thinks!

I'm pretty much perfect; 5'2 96 pounds<br>  <br>  I'm happy to see that you want to loose weight the normal way, which is a good 3 to 6 months...and it can be done with you at size 20 and your age.<br>  <br>  Walk Walk Walk! and walk some more...its actually better than running....running makes your ankles weak over time. Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true. ALSO IMPORTANT: Do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance!! :) Walking also will burn the extra surrounding fat that is covering muscles (underneath it)...so definitely do a lot of carido. Try sit ups too like 2 to 3 times a week to make abs show quicker!<br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, I’m not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, because the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain, beans, or nut aisles<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire kosher aisle has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try Edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious! (Veggie section even though it’s a bean loll)<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest. There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!?

ZJ4IQP5iaa	This may seem irrelevant, but it isn't. Hear me out.<br>  <br>  My school recently had a blood drive, and we had a good turn out of kids willing to help.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, nearly half of the kids were unable to give blood. The cause? Dehydration.<br>  <br>  The blood drive people said that my school--and the surrounding schools in our area--were the most dehydrated kids they had seen at one time.<br>  <br>  Now I can get to my point. If you're dehydrated you get thirsty. This may not seem like much of an observation, but the truth is most people don't notice that they are thirsty, especially teenagers and children, they sometimes think they are hungry.<br>  <br>  So many kids these days drink pop (soda...) that they stop drinking water. There is not enough water in pop to keep you well hydrated. <br>  <br>  The kids get thirsty; so they drink more pop. Then, when the pop doesn't make them less thirsty, they think they are hungry and they eat food and drink more pop.<br>  <br>  Many people get thirsty but don't recognize it for what it is. They think they are hungry so they eat food. The food doesn't satisfy them, so they eat more often and eat more at one sitting.<br>  <br>  A good thing to do when you feel hungry is to drink an entire glass of water about 10-20 minutes before eating a meal. Not only can this reduce hunger pains and keep you from eating more, it can keep you from eating more often.<br>  <br>  I believe that almost everybody (in America) eats too much food. Even if they don't become overweight, it can still be unhealthy and may lead to risks such as diabetes or heart attacks.<br>  <br>  A good idea is to eat an apple a day between lunch and supper (dinner--whatever you call it), and drink lots of water. <br>  <br>  That's what I do. I eat an apple everyday after school and carry a bottle of water around with me at home, otherwise I can go a week without drinking water.|`|pgseuoE7aa	it takes the stomach 20 minutes after it is full to tell your brain that it is full, and most people only take 10 to 20 minutes to eat everything on their table, therefore most of the time they eat waaay more than they needed.  a study was done when they give people soup to drink before having their meal, after a month the group of people for this experiment lost weight.  why? because the soup is hot and it makes them eat it slower so by the time their done their soup and started the main course, they realize sooner they do not need to eat so much to be full.  <br>  <br>  just eat slower and you will realize you are fuller than you think, try the soup trick too if you are impatient.|`|AAiCiPgUaa	eat healthy foods for a week or so, only take one helping at dinner, and stay away from desserts (or only allow yourself to have one or two in the first week).  i know this sounds like a diet, but it really does make your appetite smaller.|`|vgZ0V2Praa	Drink at least a glass of water before every meal.

d32v4JkYaa	i look it up for you and i hope this answers your question : Cell phones and cancer are in the news all the time now it seems.  But almost everyone uses cell phones. All over the world, tens of millions of people are pressing them against their heads for hours every day. In the U.S. it is estimated that there were at least 100 million cell phone users, as of early 2002, and that number has continued to climb.  <br>  <br>  So what's the fuss? Is cancer caused by cell phones a serious concern, or the media's panic-du-jour?<br>  <br>  A cell phone, and a household cordless phone, use a low level form of microwave radiation to send and receive their signals.  (see "How do cell phones work" here.) Microwaves, as you know, are used to cook food.  As the radiation penetrates tissue it causes it to heat.<br>  <br>  Is this a problem for us with cell phones?  That is the current debate.  Let's examine the positions and the known evidence, without hype or prejudice.

WMR8hVlfaa	No, a tampon should not break your hymen. The hymen is near the entrance of your vagina and most contain small holes that can be stretched to allow for insertion. Many women wear tampons for years before losing their virginity and their hymen is still intact afterward.<br>  <br>  Be aware, though, that the hymen can be stretched/broken through daily activity -- bike riding, exercise, etc. In centuries past when women rarely did anything but sit around and sew, cook, etc. they didn't lose their hymens but now girls/women are more active and are therefore more prone to stretch/break their hymen long before having sex. <br>  <br>  Also, some women just plain aren't born with them. (:|`|zjdOBLuYaa	You will not break your hymen using a tampon. Just be gentle. Look at the directions on the box.

These researchers developed a method that eliminated the need for a bone age x-ray. The "Khamis-Roche Method" is fairly accurate (within an inch and a half of actual growth) but is only reliable in children who have no other known medical problems.
L7g8X92uaa	you wont gain weight but if you keep on carrying on eating so little, your body will go into famine mode. This means that it will hang onto every calorie for as long as it can (hence why you dony feel hungry). Your body will start eating muscle instead of fat as it is a better source of energy and will make you look really flabby and worst of all, when you do eventually start eating more again, the pounds will pile on faster than ever. You can achieve much faster weight loss with healthy diet and exercise.|`|IGCZq7BXaa	if you dont provide your body with what it needs. then your body will take what it needs meaning it will eat you inside out|`|qXpxILnRaa	Yes, ur body will store that fat inside since ur not giving ur body enough nutrients! i know...dieting is soooo difficult; thats science 4 ya! :)|`|MF9YknDYaa	Yes,your body doesn't care if you are hungry or not,it just slows down and stores fat.

VlIFf0staa	I wouldn't worry too much. Your white blood cells are what fight off infection, so when you have an infection, they are going to be high. That is normal if you have an infection. And I wouldn't worry about HIV or cancer. There are tons of things that could cause your WBCs to be high, and infection is definitely one of them. It is not likely that it's due to anything else but that. Your mpv is a little high, this is your mean platelet volume which is the average size of your platelets. A high value could put you at increased risk for blood clots which could increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. This is something that you should talk to your doctor about when he gets back in town, but it's not an emergent situation. And it's not going to be caused by cancer or HIV. If you are still concerned, then go see another doctor.
onebeJinaa	have it checked as soon as possible, it could be a nerve or  a dislocated disc long story short don't let it get too late.

But she got dizzy in large stores/areas as well as when she raised her hands above her head.  Hers was actually a deviated septum, and she ended up having surgery to fix it.  Do a search on that and see if it fits any other symptoms you may be having.  In the meantime, try purchasing some Dramamine (it's for motion sickness), which you can get at just about any store (even some gas stations carry it) and see if that helps.

I stopped taking and went to the doctor a week later . Stomach was starting to feel better so I figured what the hell I'll just go anyway since I have the appointment .Dr told me to begin taking prilosec along with zantac - guess what - my stomach hurts like hell !!! I went for an upper gi and it came back clear for no ulcers . I have been reading many side effects online about prilosec(Omeprazole) - you may want to do some research yourself .

If you really hate going to the gym, just go for a good long walk and up hills.<br>  Keep at it, don't give up, take the time to invest in yourself, you are worth it! you will get there :)|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Start small.  Downsize the portions of the bad for you food and upsize the fruits and veggies.  So instead of having an 8oz hamburger and fries, have a 4 or 6 oz patty and veggies.  I hear you about the fresh veggies- I think frozen are a good alternative.  They last longer too!  <br>  Same with the exercise.  Set small goals.  Like doing 10 pushups and 25 situps per day.  And do some jogging in place during your favorite TV show.  When you start feeling stronger and more confident, take it outside or to the gym.  Don't worry about how you look at the gym- so many people do and no one really cares!  <br>  <br>  I know it's hard to get back into... but if you throw yourself into weight loss mode full force, you may not be able to stick with it.|`|4KMSKrxQaa	run, crunches,pushups, and small weights, and eat good.no sodas or junk food.eat only when your hungry, not just to eat or cuz your bored...try and do more each day and give yourself callenges an rewards.but if you want to lose it be mentally ready for it! good luck.|`|YqkN4nbUaa	run every morning and eat right and lift weights with little pounds|`|54cb91e02a168001f4fb39668687e75baa	get on that wii fit hunni!good luck|`|oZV7ukGqaa	I know exactly what you mean. I have started doing Turbo Jam and P90x with my husband. I had 2 kids and have been working hard to lose weight. I felt like I had let myself go too. And it was a feeling of low self esteem. The worst part was the motivation. Even though you look into the mirror every day and know you want to lose weight, it was hard to do it by yourself. I have already lost 20 lbs with this program and I have a lot more to loose. But it is helping me change my eating habits and workout habits. It is a community of people who are all doing the same thing. There is a lot of support and motivation. Plus everything you need to succeed. You should check it out, I am glad I did. I like being able to workout out from home, so I have less excuses if I can't make it to the Gym! Good luck with whatever you decide to do, YOU CAN DO IT and YOU ARE WORTH IT!
8SRjELNBaa	Theres about 10 different bulking workouts.  Give it a look, read... lots... read... everything... then join the forum.|`|oZV7ukGqaa	Have you heard of P90X? My husband and I are doing it and it is all that and more. You do chin ups and lift weights and their is a specific diet that you do with it. We love it and it works. If you have not heard of it you should look at it. It works! It is something you can do at home.

ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Depends on how much bone is exposed, how young you are, how long it was damaged before you had the work done, what kind of physical shape you are in....<br>  <br>  Best case, two months 'til you feel nothing.

wbOrZjw1aa	It's probably more common than you think, but I guess not spoken about publicly quite as much between men. <br>  I definitely think you can have feelings for someone immensely and yet not desire anything sexually with them. <br>  But like others say, it can also be part of hormones and mixed emotions.<br>  Personally, I think society finds it easy to categorise everyone into gay/straight/bisexual/curious, etc. I've been told before that every single person is unique and has unique feelings and emotions so we can't really be labelled that easily, which I think is pretty sound advice. <br>  See what happens. I wish you all the best, mate.|`|h8OqX12Haa	yes it happened to me <br>  if you a teen your hormones are jumping up and down and you might be bi curious <br>  <br>  i know that im bisexual cause im attracted to both sexes|`|HOdisPCWaa	Hey take your time think about your feeling many men have feelings for other men.

mrysAOpGaa	please don't assume its automatically him, because it could be you, and if you dont realize that the woman couldbe the reasoning, you shouldnt be trying.  Does he know that you are trying to have a baby? if so, both of you can get tested to see who is the source of the problem|`|6Ss31wyBaa	It usually has to do with the woman, not the man.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Obviously it takes two to get you pregnant. He's been trying too, so he may be wondering too. There are many stories of couples, who've tried for a long time, decided to give up and adopt, and then she suddenly becomes pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes stress and trying too hard changes your physiology, and yes perhaps there are some fertility issues. Telling him that he might be infertile is putting the blame on him, when it could be you. <br>  <br>  But my sneaking suspicion is this: Having a child is a very big deal in terms of responsibility, emotionally, financially, and in terms of your relationship.  It may be that your boyfriend isn't ready to having a child with you. By having a child, he's committing himself to a relationship with you in which neither of you have made a commitment to each other, especially if things get rough down the road... and they will. You won't have the benefit of really being a family to support you.<br>  <br>  He may feel pressured into "trying" for a child because: he "should", or doesn't want to lose you, or doesn't want to hurt or disappoint you, or likes the idea, but not the reality of it, or is afraid to say "No" to you. He may have other concerns.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that before you spend money on a fertility doctor, your starting place is to clarify what your relationship really is with each other, What is your long-term commitment to each other? How will you show it? Why do you even want to have a child without being married?<br>  <br>  Until you both clarify that, consider yourselves lucky that you haven't had a child yet.|`|v1Y3dvjgaa	1: Why blame him ?- takes two to tango- maybe you are infertile, or you have just had poor timing.<br>  <br>  2. You know, I am very old fashioned, but the child will be better off if there is a committment- like marriage- before he/she enters the picture. With a ring, if Daddy wants to take off sometime in the future, when your looks start to fade or whatever, at least he will have to support the child.   Don't think it cannot happen. Lots of women have, to their eternal regret.|`|M63kq3AYaa	1. It could be you.<br>  2. Some people take longer than others to conceive.<br>  3. Again, it could be you. It's really rude to just automatically assume it's him.|`|AA10607487	ask him|`|YnHZh6YIaa	Go see a fertility specialist.  There are a lot of things that can attribute to it.  It could be that his sperm are not swimming.  It could also be a number of reasons that deal with you including eggs not attaching properly, highly acidic environment which kills the sperm, etc.  You may even want to try picking up one of those at home ovulation testers to check for the best time to try to get pregnant.  Doing it too often can reduce sperm count and lower your chances during ovulation.<br>  <br>  If it continues on where it begins to become a chore, it would be best to talk to him about seeing a specialist to pin-point the problem.  Before doing so avoid pointing the blame at yourself or him.  Keep it open so he doesn't feel like you are attacking his manhood.  He may think that if you say his gun is firing blanks.|`|uznP52CFaa	If you are scared to ask him- why are you considering having him father your child?  <br>  Why do you want to get pregnant when you are not married? <br>  Maybe you will be very glad that you have not been "lucky". Children need a loving home with two committed parents and enough earnings to ensure they are all properly provided for.|`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	Like others mentioned, it's possible that it could be you as well.<br>  I don't know how long you've been trying or how old you both are...but if you're in your early 20's or younger a fertility doctor won't even look at you unless you've been trying for at least a year.<br>  Have you been tracking your periods? Using ovulation test strips or taking your BBT??<br>  A fertility doctor will ask you all this.<br>  Good luck|`|4PCLUlwUaa	there is probably nothing wrong with ether of you stop trying and then you should end up pg. the same thing happened to me i was so stressed that i could not get pg.  the doctor said that was way i was not pg. yet stop won-ting and stressing and it will happen good luck|`|xCifmFfkaa	Hon, fingering yourself whilst thinking of the Capt. of the football team doesn't count as TTC.|`|nb0Z8ZOaaa	ask him|`|JNspxXiJaa	Send him to a fertility clinic... and maybe you should go too.|`|zsUznopJaa	it could be u|`|HbGNHW8Qaa	Could be you too.

If you cannot get ahold of your doctor today then you should go to the ER. It is most likely not the life threatening rash that is possible with Lamictal but you don;t want to take any chances. Stop taking the Lamictal and contact yoru doctor or go to the ER immediately.|`|iyY9DDc0aa	I am currently on Lamictal and Seroquel.

My doctor has kept me on it. My seroquel also makes me very tired. I literally feel like I am drugged before I go to sleep. <br>  I have an appt to see my doc to change it. I have been on both meds for almost 2 years with no changes in the side effects.<br>  Please talk to your doc and tell them about your side effects!! Don't let it go on like I have!!<br>  Good Luck!!

Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com...</a> <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com...</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.  I lose 30 pounds in two months.|`|DpGpCwHBaa	It is not that you have failed in the motivation area its just that u haven’t found the approach that is right for u<br>  if u eat healthily and by that i mean...8 glasses of water a day....only the occasional treat <br>  eat pleanty of fruit and vegetable and lean meats like turkey, chicken and fish<br>  salads etc ull deffo lose the weight by ur special occasion<br>  make sure u do some cardio...can be anything...walking, cycling, swimming or any sport u enjoy at least 4 times a week<br>  Don’t fry out foods,,,,boil, steam or bake<br>  and don’t feel deprived as ull never stick to it so the occasional treat is fine<br>  <br>  Best of luck with it and enjoy ur special night!|`|o2iQyNKuaa	go for walks with a friend or relative at least 20 minutes a day <br>  (having a friend exercise w/ you, makes the exercise not seem so boring)<br>  don't eat very many sweets, eat fruits if you need something sweet. apples are a good choice. Limit sodas. <br>  <br>  hope this kind helps.|`|f06aacf8002deeba6f9f116a6498bea2aa	Don't target losing more than about 2 lbs per week. If you try to lose faster, your body will go into "starvation mode" and get very stingy about burning calories while at the same time very efficient about storing any calories that you do provide. And it will make you feel awful. <br>  <br>  There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the "moderate" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. <br>  <br>  Another overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.<br>  <br>  To lose a pound of fat, you need to eliminate about 3500 calories. You can do this by burning more with exercise or by modifying your diet to reduce intake. If you do a Google search on say, "swimming calories" you will quickly find a website with tables of calories burned for a given exercise. You can use such lists to estimate how many calories you are burning up with your routine.<br>  <br>  For diet, keep a diary for a couple of weeks counting calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat intake. It is easy with online sources of nutritional information (type the name of the food and calories into the Google search engine) and packaging labels. That will let you quickly figure out where the fat is coming from in your diet. <br>  <br>  Fat gives you 9 calories per gram. So take the number of grams of fat, multiply by 9, then calculate what percentage the fat calories are of your total daily calories. Restricting the calories from fat to about 20% of your total intake is ideal for a maintenance diet... that isn't overly restrictive. Of note, you need some fat in your diet. For instance, the body uses fat to produce hormones. Once you have a picture of how to modify your diet, you can drop the diary and just go back to it occasionally if you are wanting to tweek things further.<br>  <br>  There is a subset of questions that goes further and asks about "How to get a six-pack?" The answer is the same. Six-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the "core is active" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to build muscle as a way to lose fat, then you may need to increase total calories and specifically your protein intake. I target about 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight each day when actively building. That is far more protein than most people need in their diets.
tm5GTqbKaa	Hello.. So what you can do to fall asleep is close your eyes and go to sleep lol... jp.. But for reals have you tried Tylenol pm.. it helps a lot when you cant sleep.. and its not addicting.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Sexual satisfaction for men is physical, while it is emotional for women.  If you have never masturbated, you probably don't know what makes you feel good.  If you have never had an orgasm and he doesn't know how to make you have one, sex can become a chore, not a pleasure.  Also if you are tired and busy, it is hard to clear your mind of worries of the day and get into the business of having good sex.  There is nothing wrong with you that some experimentation with your own body might not cure.  Also, he needs to learn more about what makes you feel good and take the time to make you feel good before he worries about himself.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|TORBP6QIaa	Its not really bad but it can put a strain on a relationship.

I used to wear flat shoes, cause I hated heels, but now I've got a low-heeled pair of shoes which don't hurt that much, but it makes me feel a bit taller, have a better posture and exercise my calves! I'm not as thin/small as you though, since I can manage to hold/open things (I play tennis for fun - so that helped bulk my muscles up a little). I'd liked to be at eye-level with some of my friends and other people, but it seems impossible. D:|`|HetjZkdmaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height enhancer for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

W5U0PyNeaa	[1] When is the best time to exercise after a meal? When will I burn the most calories?<br>  <br>  * I don't think it makes any difference "when" you exercise as long as you exercise!  Perhaps you might feel bit uncomfortable if you exercise after eating a full meal... mainly from shaking the content of your stomach.  I exercise after my dinner but my dinner is more like a snack.<br>  <br>  [2] Which types of foods will help me lose weight?<br>  <br>  * I don't think there's one kind of food that makes you lose weight.  Concentrate on eating balanced meals rather than thinking there is a magical food that makes you burn fat.  Gotta eat for the rest of your life, so better get a healthy attitude towards food and eating!<br>  <br>  [3] What type of exercises should I be doing? How long? Which days? Scedule?<br>  <br>  * Ideally, something that you can "enjoy" therefore you can keep on doing it for the rest of your life.  "diet" or losing fat/weight is a life style, not a whim for a period of time.  Incorporate cardio(swimming, running, walking, aerobics etc) with weight/muscle building training.  More muscle, more fat burnt! <br>  <br>  [4] What foods do I need to stay away from?<br>  <br>  * deep fried foods and confectioneries(chocolates, donuts, snack bars etc)  Use logic.  Coco pops aren't healthy just because the company says it is!  Believe in your knowledge not what you want to believe. <br>  <br>  [5] Which foods do I need to be careful of?<br>  <br>  * carbs.  You need to still eat carbs, but they hide in all sorts of foods, not only pasta and rice.  Some vegetables and fruits are carbs, so be careful and I try and consume them for lunch but not dinner so I can burn them off.<br>  <br>  [6] What exercises will tone my body?<br>  <br>  * I started Thai Kick Boxing and for the first time in my life started to see tones in my body!  <br>  <br>  [7] What can I do to really get fit?<br>  <br>  * exercise daily.  Not just a stroll around a block but something to get you sweating.  Your bra should be soaked by the time you finish your daily exercise.  More you do, more you get fit.<br>  <br>  [8] What is a good goal for me to set to lose all this weight? How long? Healthy?<br>  <br>  * Think 1kg a week if you are obese.  If you are in a healthy weight range, 1kg a month.  You must remember, it's a life style change and something you should be doing for the rest of your life to a certain degree. (losing weight is harder than maintaining weight, so once you achieve your target, you can ease off a bit, but still need to exercise regularly and eat well)<br>  <br>  [9] What can I do to encourage myself not to give up?<br>  <br>  * Write down why you want or need to lose weight.  Have pictures up on the wall.... of your ideal body image.  <br>  <br>  [10] What will help me fight those craving foods and late night snacks?<br>  <br>  * Don't stay up late if you aren't "doing" anything.  You get bored and that's when you think about food.  If you've nothing to do at night, go to bed early!  <br>  [11] How can I prevent myself from overeatiing?<br>  <br>  * Don't let yourself "feel" hungry.  I always have morning teas and afternoon teas.  If you are hungry you tend to over eat.  Eat before you feel hungry.  Also always set a portion that you are going to eat and don't go for seconds.  Take away foods are always over portioned.  You  should feel satisfied but not full.<br>  <br>  [12] What will keep my mind in the right field to lose this weight?<br>  <br>  * Only you can answer this question. Everybody has different reason for wanting to lose weight.  For me, I've always been chubby or over weight and I want to be fit and flab free for ONCE in my life... preferably before I turn 30 this year!<br>  <br>  <br>  **********************************<br>  <br>  I love food and I love sugary chocolaty stuff.  So when I get tempted to eat them I say to myself<br>  <br>  "I know what it tastes like.  I've eaten them before.  It's nothing new, and I can eat them AFTER I reach my goal"<br>  <br>  It works well.  But other times I do allow myself a "fun size" snacks (100 calories or so) to prevent myself from binging on the weekend.<br>  <br>  Know how you react to different rules and restrictions.  Coming up with a routine that works for YOU for a long time is the best way to lose weight.

However, certain types of iris damage are too extensive requiring an iris "diaphragm" (made by Morcher) to cover the defect.

Tramadol is not an opiate analgesic but does have some narcotic effects. Nothing in it is related to anything opium derived. If you wanna compare it, its like tylenol. Synthetic. Not made out of tree bark like ibuprofen.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  "Best Answer" If you liked it! :)|`|KasFZL7laa	i take tramadol and have never noticed an increase in effects with grapefruit juice lol.  i think whoever told you that didn't know what they were talking about.|`|22bff6bfb8115b3d1a8a634934f041e2aa	no 2 1and yes 2 2
u8CFwtyMaa	That's not bad for your age, and I know from personal experience that a 16 year old with a penis of that length, can end up with one in the average range as an adult.<br>  80% of men are between 5 and 6.5 inches, and you stand a good chance of getting well into that range by the time you finish puberty.<br>  Mine stopped growing when I was about 18, and I've heard of guys still growing at 20.<br>  It's what you have at the end of puberty that you have to spend the rest of your life with, so don't worry just yet.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  EDIT: next time someone says they have 8 or 9 inches, just ask them to prove it, that usually shuts them up!|`|VmSKQ40Caa	As long as you have 4 inches in length, you can satisfy a female.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Listen to what you said. Everyone "brags." You can brag, too. Just say, "Oh, I'm only eight inches." Nobody is going to check you out.<br>  They too are all telling big fibs.

X6DIkFl2aa	Yeah, I wouldn't go for that technique. I tried it once. I had a 50 gallon fish tank tied to my penis for three months straight. Sure, my penis is now 63.5 inches long, but it took three months of getting strange looks from people. It wasn't all that worth it man.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Well this "technique" as you say is not news. What is actually happening though is that the erectile tissues are being elongated... the penis is not actually growing longer. This has a side effect... .that is.. a diminished rigidity. Really there's nothing better than a rock hard dick.... and any woman will tell you that she will take a firm one over a floppy one any time... .and she never complains about the size of a guys penis when he is causing her to have an orgasm everytime time. There's a lesson there for you... improve your skills.|`|e97372f377845e4d63822b38c8b4b877aa	HEY DUDE........STOP LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  hate to say it but is stretching your d   i   c   k all the way to the floor really worth the outcome????? <br>  <br>  all your gonna get is a hell of alot of pain, health problems, and stretchmarks..... you might even be left as a woman if you stretch to hard|`|qqLcvDDKaa	Yes, and some have ripped it off in the process :(<br>  <br>  not safe at all, never try it.

e97372f377845e4d63822b38c8b4b877aa	hey dude listen i dosent matter where you start, but you gotta start somewhere. who cares if you feel lame? 3 years from now if you haven't been lifting your still gonna feel lame.... i bench 305lbs and im 17! how did i do it? i worked my *** off. so dude if i could do it. you can. it takes alot of time and effort.. dont give it up, and yeah you're starting from ground 0 where most guys start.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Now, all those men lifting heaps of weights had to start sometime, didn't they? You are a new comer. You will do yourself a bad injury if you try first off with something that your body cannot handle. Nobody would b thinking that you are lame. When you are lifting weights, your attention is wholly taken by the tasks to hand, not 'sneering' at somebody else. Keep things going in accordance as to how your trainer has shown you. Within weeks (yes, that soon) you will develop a solid chest. The muscles in your arms will begin to ripple. Your legs become so masculine and solid. Make sure you do something to build your abs, too. You'll soon have a six pack to be proud of. <br>  <br>  You will feel awfully sore after your first work out. That will just go away after a couple of days after those muscles sort themselves out.<br>  It will not be so long, either, that you will want to get somewhere quickly and you sprint with ease uphill. The feeling is so good.<br>  <br>  don't overdo your training. You increase weights when what you are handling now becomes easy.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Best advice around is to mix it up as much as possible. Everyone starts somewhere so just relax and get into it. People at the gym are usually quite helpful so dont be afraid to ask advice from someone who is built well.|`|4DNH5AfIaa	well everyone gave training advice, lets answer the question.<br>  <br>  i started with just the bar when i bench pressed. but i was afraid of looking bad too, so i started with some machines, a good tip when using machines is do what you think the max you can do (about 10 reps) then u do a lower amount. still difficult but not as difficult. or start at a weight, do your reps, quickly lower it to the next increment, keep going with as little rest as possible do this for three weight increments it will burn, it will work.<br>  <br>  once your comfortable in the gym, and you have a little experience, go bench press,  and most importantly dont be scared to ask for help, you can hurt your self.<br>  <br>  just remember, all those strong guys started where you are.|`|m2dxbdHWaa	well im 17 almost 18, and am 6' 200lb.<br>  i have had a six pack for like ever. i am athletic in school, but hardly worked out. but for the stomach would have to be crunches and sit-ups. or hang on monkey bars and bring you knees to your chest the best you can.<br>  the torso, well benching and push-ups should do.<br>  now legs..........well...you walk on them. but still i dont worry about them, but running works.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	yes, but at some point you should find an amount of weight that you can do repetitions of 12 with. and eventually you'll start getting higher and higher in weight|`|SJunThLBaa	barbell, dumbbells, EZ bar
IvrcZVMjaa	Start light.  No one here can tell you what weight to lift because we aren't there with you.  What you could bench on a fixed machine isn't a good guide.  It's perfectly OK to start with just the bar.  The important thing is to get the technique right first.  Then start adding weight - slowly.  Better to go slow and get there than try to much.  An injury will put you out of training far longer than building slowly would take.<br>  <br>  Don't forget that with the free weights you need to add in the weight of the bar if you are comparing - but don't.  What matters is that the weight is right for you, not how you compare to anyone else.  <br>  <br>  Start lighter than you think you should, then work up and pay attention to your technique.|`|ej6OdnDBaa	well start at whatever you can rep 10 times. that way you can fully work your chest by doing 3 or more sets. or you can do heavy weight by choosing weight you can rep 5 times and doing like 5 sets.  Try to bench the bar, and 10lbs on each side to start.
02LoHEwvaa	Hey, I understand your frustration!<br>  <br>  I bought numerous anti-pimple/acne products but it doesn't help at all!  I wasted like hundreds over dollars and have no results.<br>  The most frustrating part is.. you think your face is about to be pimple/acne-free and you realize a new one is coming!  ARGH!<br>  <br>  I used to be in your shoes so I really understand how you feel.  Now my skin is perfect and beautiful!<br>  <br>  There's a book that helped me a lot - it clears pimple/acne myths and teaches you the real cure!  It only took 2-3 days for my acne/pimples condition to improve significantly!  This book has been the most talked about among determologists.

AA11879371	You are running too much!  You have to have recovery time for your muscles.  Here is a site for runners that has lots of good advice:   <a href="http://community.active.com/thread/51882" rel="nofollow">http://community.active.com/thread/51882</a><br>  <br>  Also, because you are running so much you probably sweat, a lot.  Your potassium and calcium levels may be low and that will cause pain.  Check your shoes, the wrong shoe will throw off your stride and cause pain in your calves.  Shin spits is an issue too.  <br>  <br>  Hope the site helps and good luck!|`|rvmj8vVCaa	Stretch! It could be your shins. Sometimes shin splints can cause calve pain. I would suggest getting some tape&prewrap and taping your shin/calve area real good before running. It's going to limit your mobility a little but not to the point where you can't run. This should help a lot. Ice and heat, 15 minutes each as much as needed. Aleve Liquid gels for when your in horrible pain. Also get a massage! They help a lot.<br>  <br>  Keep taping them for about a week, and then gradually get back into without the tape. Hope this helps(:

W6QatTEbaa	You are what you believe you are, if someone comes up and say something mean to you, that doesn't mean it's true, as long as you don't agree with it then it's not true. <br>  You are nice, I can see that because this has affected you, as it did to me when I was a teen, but you just gotta like and love yourself and feel good about yourself, and that's all you have to do, be sure of who you are, and when someone stupid come and try to knock you down you can just say "I know you are but what am I"  :P|`|GbgeGmzNaa	Tell him to f off. What type of adult calls someone names, for no particular reason anyway?|`|xnBbmCkCaa	You know what? I've gotten called a dork a few times at work, and on the street. This was by my peers and adults. You know, that  is part of living in the real world, people love to insult people with any kind of thing they have that is not normal according to the insulter. Don't worry about that adult who called you a dork. It makes it that more sad that it was an adult who did that, because that adult is so immature. What kind of dude in his thirties acts like he's on an elementary school playground? I think all of those people are just less than people like you and me, because they feel the need to insult us, when we've done nothing to deserve the insults!|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am significantly older than 15.  <br>  <br>  I can tell you from experience that a lot of people say hurtful things that they probably don't realize are as hurtful as they are.   One of the problems a lot of people have is that they don't know how to interact with people who are younger than they are.  This is true for adults,  and for you.  <br>  <br>  A lot of adults are more harsh with kids than they should be.   Some adults joke around with each other pretty roughly.  If they want to do that with themselves,  so what?   It is not OK, though,  for an adult to be in the habit of calling his or her friends "a dork"  and then to call a 15-year-old kid a dork.  <br>  <br>  You probably joke around with your own friends in ways that would be wrong of you to joke around with a little kid.  You're a kid,  but an older kid.  I'll bet you've hurt the feelings of a little kid once or twice.  Most people do such things unintentionally.   We all sometimes forget to be as thoughtful as we should be. <br>  <br>  In my opinion,  you should think about this situation in one of two ways:<br>  <br>  1.)  The person who called you a dork is a mean spirited jerk who purposely tried to offend you.  That would be mean,  and if it's true this person is someone whose opinion of you should not matter.  He or she is mean and nasty - a big fat bully.  Bullies like to hurt people's feelings,  and in my experience it is usually the nicest people who get attacked by a bully.   If it was a bully that called you a dork,  that is probably proof that you're a nice person,  because bullies usually hate and attack nice people.<br>   <br>  OR, THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS:<br>  <br>  2.)  The person said something that he or she barely even thought about.  It was a careless mistake.   Maybe he or she didn't really think at all first,  and didn't mean it at all.  Maybe it was supposed to be sort of joke,  but just didn't work very well.  He or she might have realized that it wasn't very funny,  but was too embarrassed to apologize,  figuring it would only make it worse if he or she made a big deal out of it.  In this case,  the person messed-up.  If so,  you should try to forgive the person even if he or she does not apologize.  We all mess up sometimes.  <br>  <br>  In my experience,  most people who hurt the feelings of someone else fall into the second category I described.  Most people don't purposely offend other people.  Anyone who does is someone who you should consider not very nice, and not your friend.  If you were purposely hurt you should not care what that kind of person thinks of you.  He or she was hurtful just to be mean,  not because he or she actually thinks you are a dork.   On the other hand,  if it was basically an accidental offense,  you shouldn't stay upset because the person did not even mean what he or she said.   <br>  <br>  I have heard lots of adults tell kids your age that you are in the best years of your life - that you have it made now, and adulthood is way harder.  That is baloney.  I am well into adulthood.  I have been a kid, and I have been an adult.  Adulthood is way better than childhood.  My adulthood has been very difficult in many ways,  and I still like it way better than being a kid.   Look forward to continuing to grow up.  Adulthood will be here for you sooner than you realize.  And it is way better than childhood.   When you are an adult,  remember what it was like to be a kid.  Some people forget,  and they do things like the person did who hurt your feelings.  Become the best adult you can be,  and use this whole experience as a lesson about  how to treat kids when you are an adult.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|b95d3948683c7afd43c89eba8e412306aa	Older people and your peers can say things that show they have a problem not you , and when a person points a finger at you, remember they have three pointed back at them. Don't let anyone ruin your day because of their negative attitude. Keep being the person you are positive and move on.|`|qOzGKg9paa	That adult is the dork... you know your cool when you insult people like 20 years younger than you.<br>  <br>  They were probably just fooling around.|`|7hlDYIJAaa	hey...it's one person, don't let that get to you. wat really matters is wat YOU think of YOURSELF.if you think your a dork then well try to change it but i'm sure you are not a dork.|`|nO7Ie91laa	ignore him since he obviously does not have a life since he is picking on 15 year old guys.
ErtMD5NZaa	Please do not follow directions from anyone other than if they tell you to use fresh contact lens solution! <br>  <br>  Tap or even bottled water contain micro-organisms that you do not want to get on your lenses. They can cause infections. Putting contacts in a cup leaves the fluid exposed to air which could ruin the lenses. <br>  <br>  I once tried putting lenses in solution in something other than a proper lens case, and by morning the fluid had turned into jelly and my lenses were ruined. <br>  <br>  Pop out to a local drugstore and buy yourself a starter kit of solution.

PImvmP1paa	Okay. <br>  <br>  Most birth control pills are 99.9% effective, if taken correctly. <br>  <br>  Some to most birth control does clear up your acne. <br>  <br>  Most birth control pills are combination pills, meaning they have estrogen and progesterone hormones that are natural to the female body in them. Combination pills help prevent ovulation, which in turn helps prevent pregnancy. Birth control also helps by changing the consistency and/or texture of cervical mucus (discharge) so that way it makes it harder for sperm to travel. It also helps by thinning the lining of your uterus to help prevent implantation, if an egg does get fertilized. <br>  <br>  Birth control also helps to preserve fertility. (One of my gynecologists says this.) It also helps to prevent against ectopic pregnancy, and a form of female cancer. (My other gynecologist says this.)<br>  <br>  Typically you cannot control your periods with birth control. It will come each month, unless you do not start your inactive (reminder) pills each month. <br>  <br>  Your periods will get lighter and you will have less cramps with birth control. <br>  <br>  You should also give 3 to 4 months for your birth control to start taking full effect and for you to decide weather you like it or not. <br>  <br>  While taking antibiotics with birth control, always remember to use a back up method of birth control (condoms, spermicide, etc.).<br>  <br>  Yes, you can use birth control if you're not having sex. <br>  <br>  You may also need to go to a gynecologist before starting birth control to make sure you don't have anything wrong down there.<br>  <br>  Side effects of the pill are: Dizziness, becoming light headed, blurred vision, headaches, sore or swollen breasts (common side effect that happens with most pills), nausea/vomitting, weight gain, and mood swings. Some can cause hair loss.|`|hARy7nsMaa	Birth control pills do help with acne, give you shorter/lighter/less painful periods. They also prevent cysts from growing on your ovaries.<br>  <br>  The only side effect I've gotten from taking the pill is nausea the morning after when I took my pill at night, but this only lasted for about 4 days. And yes, you can take them even if you're not having sex because they also help regulate your periods and prevent pms.|`|ReHJAUfRaa	yeah im not on them but my friend is and she gets really light periods for 2 days tops each month. and i definatley noticed her skin clear up and her boobs went up a cup size too. and shes not ssexualy acctive either. go for it!|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	Yes, so pills can help clear up your skin....and some of them will help with you cramps.  They also can make your period lighter and more regular.<br>  <br>  <br>  Depending on the pill there can be several side effect.  Weight gain is one of the most common.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can absolutely be on the pill and not have sex.<br>  <br>  Please talk to your doctor about the complications/side effects.

rleOrwRxaa	If you did this, you'd probably lose 3 - 5 lbs a week, but know that most (if not all) of it will be muscle tissue lost. Your body will go into starvation mode and as a result its going to lock up fat stores and synthesize protein into sugar to fuel your cells. Protein synthesis will be derived from the amino acids introduced both externally and via your own muscle tissue. <br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight and retain muscle so that you look damn good when you reach your goal. You should follow the national RDA as follows:<br>  <br>  consume 10% - 35% of your diet as protein<br>  consume 20% - 35% of your diet as healthy fats (consume less than 10% as saturated fat and try to eliminate trans fats entirely)<br>  consume 45% - 65% of your diet in carbohydrates and try to make them complex carbohydrates. The closer it is to its natural form (i.e. oatmeal, brown rice, etc.) the better.<br>  <br>  The absolute best thing you could do is figure out your basal metabolic rate (BMR). I've provided below the Harris-Benedict formula which will tell you how many kilocalories (just normal calories) you should be consuming a day for weight loss.<br>  <br>  Harris-Benedict formula:<br>  <br>  Men: BMR = (66 + (13.7 X wt in kg) + (5 X ht in cm) - (6.8 X age in years)) x 1.2<br>  Women: BMR = (655 + (9.6 X wt in kg) + (1.8 X ht in cm) - (4.7 X age in years)) x 1.2<br>  <br>  Note: 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters<br>  1 kilogram = 2.2 lbs.<br>  <br>  Once you calculate your BMR, make sure your total caloric intake does not fall below the given number, or your body risks going into starvation mode.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: keep in mind that you should expect to lose 2 - 3 lbs of FAT per week. No more. Its mathematically impossible to lose more than that per week without losing muscle mass. Especially when you consider that one pound of fat is 3500 kcal. 3 lbs would be 10500 kcal. If you needed 2500kcal per day based on your basal metabolic rate and if you cut out 500 calories (which is alot) per day, then thats only 3500kcal per week or 1lb a week. The TRUE TRICK is turning your body into a fuel burning machine via exercise. If you want to know the science of exercise and how it turns your body into a crazy friggen machine of epic fat burning proportions, the first link below will break it down in an easy to understand way for you.<br>  <br>  Also, I HIGHLY recommend you go to www.mypyramid.gov and do some research there. It will help you in your quest for fat loss and you wont have to suffer with poor quality foods, starvation or general malnutrition.|`|5qW4qnWTaa	It all depends on what type and how long your workout is but from my experience about 5 to 7 lbs in two weeks (this would be with a two hour, 5 days a week work out)|`|SsB7aRExaa	Hmmm.  You'd probably loose whatever is currently in your bowels.  That can be messy if you're not close to a bathroom.  When you are not used to eating much fruit, the sudden change can give you loose bowels.<br>  <br>  As for weight, well, you'd LOSE whatever the stuff in your bowels weigh, but not much more.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.elearnenglishlanguage.com/difficulties/looselose.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elearnenglishlanguage.com/dif...</a>|`|2qPtGTNcaa	It really depends on your resting metabolic rate. That's how many calories you burn just existing, without exercise. Just making a rough guess, it you are 170 pounds, then you need to eat less than 1600 or 1700 calories a day to lose any weight at all. So, you are probably eating around 1400 to 1500 calories easy on this diet (I'd need to know portions to give you an exact answer). You would therefore run a 100 to 300 calorie a day deficit, which equals a monthly weight loss of 1 to 3 pounds.

R3Jtm4Wtaa	You are not going to gain much using 10lbs weights man. With this kind of weight you can afford to work out all muscle groups every day, but you won't get much more than better muscle tone. If you want to bulk up you'll need to increase your workload incrementally.  See how much weight you can do about 5 reps with, then take about 60-80% of that weight and do about 8-10 reps 3 times. Gradually increase your maximum weight. <br>  Once you start lifting more weight, you should only work on each group once every 48 hours maximum. Depending on how much time you have each day, do two groups a day, for instance legs and arms one day, chest and shoulders the next. Or one group a day if you're strapped for time. Be sure to take a day off every week as well. Rest is just as important to muscle gain as is the actual workout.<br>  More reps with less weight = toning. <br>  Less reps with more weight = muscle gain.<br>  <br>  Don't expect much from 10lbs weights. You can do 1000 reps a day (in a manner of speaking) and still not gain any real bulk. You'll get a little stronger of course, but not bigger.|`|vx2MaQg0aa	Put down those 10lb dumbells and go get a gym membership your not gonna build anythin with 10lb and dont do each muscle everyday ur muscle needs atleast 48hrs to recover from previous workout..

qnD5RfbPaa	Vitamins are any of various fat-soluble or water-soluble organic substances essential for normal growth and activity of the body and obtained naturally from plant and animal foods.  Hence vitamins are foods not drugs.  Therefore it is safe to take any combination of vitamins and minerals, which are also foods.  It is even safe to take them with most pharmaceutical products.  As a matter of fact it is essential that you take them with some form of drugs, such as anti-biotic etc.<br>  <br>  Another thing to note is that while there is usually a recommended dosage on the package, these dosages are usually a small percentage of what our bodies require to function healthy.  The manufacturer takes into consideration that there are a few persons who eats very well and are in good health.  The intention is that these persons take the supplements to maintain their good health.  It follows then that if you're having a problem you will need more vitamins than those that are having good health.  For this reason even doubling or tripling dosages are sometimes necessary to restore good health.  Hence if you are taking a number of supplements with the same content except for a few differences, it is still safe to take them all together.<br>  <br>  When shopping for supplements however, it is better to select those formulated from natural foods.  These are usually more effective since your body will absorb most of its contents.  Synthetically formed supplements do not absorb well and so you get very little if anything from these.  Some of these can prove to be toxic over time.  For example synthetically formulated vitamin A is toxic if taken over certain concentration over time.  However you can use carotenoids (from natural foods) which are precursors to vitamin A (meaning your body uses these carotene to produce vitamin A) and get better results without the toxicity. <br>  <br>  Another thing to note is that your hair, skin and nails are usually the last to indicate deficiency.  Usually the major organs such as the heart, kidney, bones etc., pulls from these areas, when they are not getting enough to function well.  Sometimes the reason you are deficient in a nutrient is not because you are not consuming this particular nutrient, but because you are not consuming other nutrients that are essential for its transportation and absorption. For example, fat soluble vitamins needs fat to transport them.  Calcium needs vitamin D, K, phosphorous and other nutrients for effective absorption.<br>  <br>  Hence it would be equally as good for your hair, nails and skin if you take a very good multivitamin plus minerals, formulated from natural foods while you stick to a very good diet. <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjQJ2aOyE4FX2Fe2A0AUpf_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081230061340AAbXoFM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|9pLdhuBnaa	It is probably ok to take both but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
0didTstUaa	i believe carl is a sponser for his weight loss company  and i know im right cu that response is everywhere. and the magezine thing with self is a good idea but i also think it s asponser because it says get a subscription. which you shouldnt get into in my opinion.. this is a question you should really ask a doctor, as self action could result in harm. if you dont have the money for that, or just dont want to, then take it slow but straight. making sure go gentle and not rush anything. i believe you should start by analyzing the amount of calorie intake you have, and compare it to the average 2,000 cals a day for the average, healthy person (not saying you arnt healthy). after doing this, find out what you eat every day and cut out certain things that you really dont need. you will need some willpower for this. if you can, stick to a specifc diet, every day, (not a specific food as you will get bored and will quickly stop) but do NOT suddenly go straight to 2000 cals a day, as if you are a high number over this, it will harm you. losing that much weight will, no doubt, be difficult, it may start slowly and then speed up depending on what happens, but if you stick to a specific diet to start with, that should help you shed quite a few pounds. and another thing. you wont notice a difference until someone else does. youll know what i mean when it happens. if you want a specific excersise routine that i used to help me, feel free to email me at  soulstealer423@rock.com   hope this helped.<br>  good day ;)|`|Q4NFFBizaa	well you have to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound.

As for excersice, cardio is the best way to lose weight, this means running jogging and walking, as well as like a tae-bo class or something similar.

FT2dOlZEaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  The ‘average’ length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".<br>  <br>  It’s worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6". <br>  <br>  There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys ‘shrink’ a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.<br>  <br>  The ‘average’ girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7” and 5.2” is normal. <br>  <br>  Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.<br>  <br>  Approximate lengths for under 18’s are:<br>  At the beginning of puberty 2.4” <br>  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0”<br>  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0”<br>  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0”<br>  <br>  To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm|`|Hv91Jcn5aa	Yup the high end of average. But might look tiny if your extremely tall.

You say that the incidents have gotten better but have not stopped altogether which means that there is something that's causing them.  You should also have a complete physical just in case it's something that's physical in origin. You should check out all of the possibilities.

Cutting those out of your diet all together will probably help you lose 2-3 pounds. <br>  <br>  Secondly, it doesn't sound like you're actually eating enough. When you drastically restrict your calories your body thinks you're starving, and stores fat for later. You should be eating more protein, more fiber, and a lot of dark green vegetables like spinach or broccoli. And don't skip lunch! Eating a pack of crackers is not lunch. Also, make sure to read labels and try to avoid food with High Fructose Corn Syrup and Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil. <br>  <br>  Eat lots of fresh vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains and you'll start losing weight without even trying. <br>  <br>  Also, to tone your stomach muscles, try crunches and sit-ups.|`|mABE76Dhaa	try hypnosis|`|jTHwys8Xaa	Listen chunky, leave the crackers and baked spaghetti alone, they are packed with carbs, even if they say fat free, add a few flights of stairs a day, maybe walk to or from school, or around your block a few times a day, oh yeah cereal is packed with carbs too, replace with a fruit and drink low fat milk, dairy is really good for weight control, in low amounts, stay away from chocolate milk and soda pop, water instead, and the green tea will work wonders, take care have a good prom. 15 pounds in month is going to be unachievable healthy anyways, try for half of that,|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Not to be mean, you can't control yourself (according to you, anyway) and your diet is less than healthy.<br>  <br>  You need to eat more than some lame crackers for lunch.<br>  Eat a REAL lunch.

You are in a safe environment.  Please don't be afraid to go into a hospital.  It's not a bad place to be.   I have been in the hospital quite a number of times when I was severely depressed.  The doctor will probably let you make the choice.  Please do consider going inpatient.   I hope you will feel better soon.  Please stay safe.  Best Wishes.|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	i've always wanted to go to a mental hospital. where everyone there cares for you, or at least for the money they get paid for. and people look out for you. i'm pretty sure they wont do anything bad to you in that hospital, why not just go? i always felt that going to a hospital might help me, since my parents seem to neglect me. but its too bad i dont have a ride there.<br>  <br>  i wonder, is it free to stay there?<br>  <br>  if you take things in at a calmer perpective then everything seems solvable, like a math question.<br>  lawl the only reason i'm calm is that i've been feeling so down lately.<br>  <br>  if you really dont want to go there then when he asks whats wrong with you or omg i think you need help, just say that you already have help and you're going to a psycologist, even if you arent. if he asks for a note that says that you go to a psycologist then just say that its personal information that you dont like handling out.|`|7mfKuYF6aa	I have been in a mental hospital twice for suicide attempts and am I cutter myself, so I know what I'm talking about on this one. <br>  <br>  They will only admit you if they think you are a danger to yourself or others. MOST therapists will not admit you to a hospital unless they believe that your cutting is life threatening. If you tell them that you are seriously considering killing yourself (as opposed to just imagining it) they will admit you for that. <br>  <br>  Other than that, you are safe. Don't go to a mental hospital unless you really need to. They are not nice places. Like I said, though, unless you tell this doctor that you intend to kill yourself or that your injuries are life-threatening, you should be totally safe.|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	Only if your psychiatrist sees you as a danger to yourself. <br>  <br>  But in the long run it could be a good thing, if you're cutting, depressed, and panicking, you may have a mental illness that needs medication therapy, and talking to a psychiatrist may help you get work some of these things out. <br>  <br>  Don't be scared, and try to keep yourself strong, things will be better once you get your depression under control.|`|9iXGakohaa	If you are over 18 no one can force you to be admitted. However, there are people who have depression and self harm problems that are frequently sent to clinics and if you are under 18 your parents can force you. <br>  <br>  If you are threatening to harm yourself then they may try to send you but I think your therapist will probably try and get to know your individual issues, and the severity of what is happening before they send you out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2QtnKQ5kaa	It all depends on the doctor you are seeing, the mental state you are in, and whether or not you are a real danger to yourself and/or others or not.<br>  <br>  That being said, let me tell you about myself.<br>  <br>  I am 32 years old, and I've never once been in a mental hospital.  I was depressed and suicidal starting at age 7.  I've been paranoid, self-injuring, and have had both suicidal and homicidal urges.  I was in your spot too-- I hid in my apartment with all the lights out and didn't talk to a soul.  My social anxiety was so bad that I couldn't make a phone call, or fill out a job application, or even buy a drink at a store.<br>  <br>  When I started undergoing therapy and psychiatric care, I received my diagnoses:  Borderline Personality Disorder, Dysthymia, and social anxiety.  And though other people have said getting a diagnosis was a burden to them, it was UPLIFTING to me-- it made me feel less "crazy" to know there was a NAME for it and that if I worked hard enough, I could not only control it but start to feel better, with regulated emotions!!!!<br>  <br>  Please, please don't hold anything back because you have a fear of going to the mental hospital.  My Dad went to the mental hospital for ten years during my childhood.  As I said, I didn't go at all.  But with both me and my father, neither one of us held back any information.<br>  <br>  If you are ever going to get better, you're going to have to tell ALL and risk the possibility of going to the mental hospital.  It won't be like you think-- I know that from listening to Dad.<br>  <br>  But please, please, please don't hold back!!!|`|2Y1DLQ1Faa	First of all, you don't need to be afraid of a mental hospital.  I don't know where you live, but in the state of Idaho you won't be hospitalized if you cooperate with the psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, counselor or whoever you are working with.  Be truthful!  Going into counseling is about learning the tools and skills you need to be able to manage your life and your problems in the real world.  Counseling will help you find answers to questions that you maybe haven't even realized you had.  Counseling is hard, painful work, and while your counselor may put his/her arm around you or hold your hand he/she should never touch you in an inappropriate way, and under no circumstances should your counselor blame you for whatever may have happened in the past.  Give your counselor an honest chance, but don't be afraid to move on if it doesn't work out.
I08iONdaaa	run run run. the mile is a hard race, if you want to be good at it. A good way to build up long spurts is by doing intervals. Run 1 lap at a 90% sprint. then run 1 lap at a brisk jog. then run 2 laps at a 90% sprint then 1 lap brisk jog. keep doing this up to 4 laps of 90% sprint and then work back down to 1. <br>  <br>  The key to the mile is running at a fast pace for the first three laps and then kicking it up for the fourth. if you want to run a good mile you have to be able to stay near the front and then kick up the pace near the end.<br>  <br>  Really there's no other way around it, forcing yourself to run fast in training for long periods of time is the only way to get faster on race day.|`|bfbb075a648d2adfef8a614187b2e269aa	condition, workout, and eat healthy... keep your body conditioned  and fit so you'll be able to run faster. Workouy regularly as much as 3 - 4 times a week or more if you want. As long as you have a healthy and stable balance of training when you're ready to compete. You can always consult with the coach on what event you should run in if you're not sure...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
vRfcSOe5aa	even with masking emotions feeling like an easier way to fix a problem, it really makes it all worse. its completely unhealthy to let the stress eat at you like that, you need to find a way to deal with it. life is really hard believe me i know. there are things out there that can help.<br>  <br>  there are also quizzes and stuff...

Your primary care physician can set you up with someone if you have a hard time finding someone.|`|laQE6i8Vaa	Go and see your doctor, he/she can help you and give you information on counseling if there is something you need to say. Talking to people who know you might not help as much as talking to someone who can understand and is not in the situation. <br>  If you don't need to talk about anything to a counselor, your doctor can help you in other ways such as medication but I'd only go down that route if it is really necessary. Your doctor should know if it is or not.<br>  Hope this helps and you feel better soon!|`|Lw3OnqEtaa	Yeah, this could be depressiong. But you should go and see a doctors.

7r4paUFhaa	It's not safe to lose that much weight in such a short period of time, especially since you aren't under the watchful eye of a trainer, doctor, and dietitian. 1-2 pounds per week is the average amount of weight to lose in a healthy way. I think it would be safer for you to just buy a spanx leotard to wear underneath your costume leotard. BUT, you can eat healthy meals, chicken, fish, fruits and veggies, and exercise up until the play and see how that goes. Maybe you don't need to lose as much as you think.|`|XQJg3RNTaa	not safely possible, you'll be fine, you should really save these sort of worries for when your older, trust me, they'll still be there.|`|rjwDfBkyaa	Not possible. You don't really know enough to decide how much weight to lose. Try running, swimming and other areobic exercise and be logical about weight loss.|`|w0ZDe89Laa	So I hear it is possible to lose up to 10 lbs a week...but it's hard...not you're average diet, lose 5 lbs in your first month. I suggest if you have a gym membership...get a personal trainer for a month and you gotta be REALLY determined. I've been on a diet now for 3 months and I've lost like 5 lbs, so it's not easy!|`|9OjelayMaa	This isn't possible unless you want to land a nice bed in the local emergency room.
b5dd78abf070858de1fd3c0f2e631674aa	Answer:<br>  <br>  Absolutely not!  Actually the more frequently you eat the faster you metabolism becomes and the more fat you burn!  Do you really want to lose weight or do you want to lose BODY FAT?  There is a huge difference.  Fat takes up 5 times more space per pound then muscle.  You could lose 40 pounds and still not look and feel the way you want to!  <br>  <br>  You need to eat to lose Fat.  If you’re just interested in a number (your weight) and you eat one meal a day you will burn muscle.  Muscle burns 17-50 calories a day, fat burns 1-2 calories a day.  If you burn muscle you lose your bodies defense to rid itself of fat!  If you lose 10 pounds of body weight and 8 of it is muscle you decrease you bodies ability to lose body fat by 400 calories a day.... that means you gradually lose your ability to lose fat. <br>  <br>  I suggest you eating 5 servings of carbohydrates from fruits a day, 3 servings of lean meat a day, and unlimited green vegetables.  If you are going to snack get a good tasting protein shake like muscle milk ready to drink containers.  They taste great.<br>  <br>  Basic weight loss if the:<br>  Calorie intake  GREATER THAN calories burned = WEIGHT GAIN<br>  Calorie intake  Same As  calories burned= Stay same weight<br>  Calories Burned GREATER THAN calorie intake=  WEIGHT LOSS<br>  <br>  You need another reason to eat frequent meals?  Every time you eat your body burns 10% of the calories consumed during the digestion process!  So the more you eat the more logs you are throwing on the fire keeping your metabolism primed.  Now if you are throwing Twinkies on the fire six times a day THAT’S NOT GOING TO WORK!  You have to eat good food.  <br>  <br>  No fried foods<br>  No sugar<br>  Limit your consumption of white carbs like potatoes and white bread to less then 200 calories a day.<br>  <br>  You do this you will be happy with your results.  If you eat one meal a day your body will go into starvation mode and it will start trying to hold on to what you want to lose!  So you need to eat to lose!  Then when you go back to your normal eating habits your body which thinks it is starving will actually store all the food you eat as fat….in preparation for the next famine!  <br>  <br>  So get on a good plan and what ever you do… DON’T JUST EAT ONE MEAL A DAY!<br>  <br>  Don Strange<br>  President, Physical Fitness Forum   <br>  www.physicalfitnessforum.com
cdaae96Yaa	I think it will work but you might want to make the milk skim milk.  Your diet sounds well thought out and skim milk has no fat in it so it will make your diet better!|`|YDoNiqxbaa	Hi  The best way I found to lose weight was to start with a short walk everyday to begin with and then once a week jog the same route. At the same time drink at least 2 litres of water a day and always use the stairs whenever posible. Eat at least 1 apple and 1 banana a day and increase the amount of milk you drink. If you want a quick burst of weight loss you will need some help. I got some Acai Berry free at <a href="http://linkbee.com/ITRR" rel="nofollow">http://linkbee.com/ITRR</a> and I used that and saw about 20lbs come off very fast using all these thngs together. Good luck!|`|nIIbDKhEaa	Whole Milk is pretty much bad for you in any amount, try to use 1%, or even skim, if you can manage it.  Also, cut down on the ranch, it is extremely fatty.  Try eating the salad without the ranch to maximize your results.<br>  <br>  But your exersize is on-par with what it should be, so other than some excess fat you are consuming in your diet, you are golden.|`|ypeYciePaa	seems like its should work, when I had food poisoning I lost 15 lbs, went from 240 to 235, and have cut down on eating, now back to 227 and 36-38, I'm 5'11, if u lost 30 lbs u should easily reach yer goal, sounds like a good plan. keep it up
RhTSmFHTaa	EXERCISE, is key. I would start off with running/jogging every day.<br>  This will get your blood flowing and boost your metablolism. You will also start to feel better and want to exercise.<br>  Then try doing some crunches/sit ups this will help build some muscle.<br>  Bicycling, jump roping, and cleaning(believe it or not) also will help you lose calories.<br>  <br>  EATING HABITS, that's a major thing people forget about as thier livers progress. As a kid, you were able to eat fast food and chips all the time and not gain much weight. Now that you are getting older your body needs more care. Try eating lean meats or tofu, drinking lots of water, cutting out sodas (They are full of sugar that turns to fat, and no diet soda isn't okay, it's worst.), eat fruits and vegtables, and maybe try taking a multi-vitamin or something of the kind.<br>  <br>  SLEEP, is also a contributing factor to weight gain, when you sleep, believe it or not, you lose weight, BUT this does not mean to sleep all day long because that's bad too.<br>  <br>  EATING, is important, DO NOT starve yourself, it will lead to more problems and few pounds will be lost. You should eat 4-5 SMALL meals a day. This will help boost your immune system.<br>  <br>  SNACKING is bad, but can be good depending on what you choose.<br>  Pretzels, yogurt, trail mix, protien drink, smoothies, cereal, non-fat milk, fruit, vegtables, salad, and granola bars are just some of the many good snaking foods.<br>  <br>  BREAKFAST, is the most important meal of your day, believe it or not, it's what starts your metabolism. So, eat breakfast everyday, but make good choices. These include: low-fat milk, juice, water, eggs, lean breakfast meats, waffles (in moderation), etc. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a>  <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|03g0WSvZaa	try the lil Jack workout <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a><br>  its fun and easy|`|CYF3PrrNaa	My friend said that she lost weight by buying dance workout DVD's.

She is now very much addicted and it took over her life, just would only smoke once a month, then once a week, then everyday, till she now smokes around TEN a day. She got pregnant and continued smoking, she lost her job because of negligence and has broken of all contact with her family and friends.<br>  I feel sorry that I didn't stop her when I still could, try to talk to your gf, don't let her become an addict; pot is addicting even though smokers admit that it is not.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	its not dangerous..<br>  <br>  you can get pneumonia and bronchitis and other things alot easier though<br>  <br>  you shouldnt be worried about it though.. if she gets sick tell her to stop smoking till shes better though|`|0B2a5lD9aa	its dangerous if you do it...lets leave it at that. but, ya probably the more the worse.

Not bathtub water or pool water, but deep water. Like a lake or an ocean. It's steadily growing worse as I get older. <br>  And it's strange, because as I grow older, my imagination in suppose to subside a bit, and I should be able to thing logically about it. But I can't handle the thoughts of being "pulled" under, or trapped in a current, or the thought of life beneath me. Also, when I  picture water and going out deeper, I realize how far up I'm going from any ground. It really frightens me. <br>  <br>  I would LOVE for it go away! Then I could swim with my little brother and go on boat rides instead of instantly thinking of other places I'd have to be during that week. :)|`|t3XMg3Wbaa	I'm afraid of big bodies of water, deep ones.

2jMFurDoaa	the brand and generic brands have the same effect. the generic is just incredibly cheaper.<br>  <br>  the brand name pill cost about 3.00 a dose and the generic cost just under a dollar.<br>  <br>  but if you have insurance than you dont need to worry about that to much.|`|hQD3WNdQaa	well im not sure about the amphetamine salts, but as for the adderal my daughter which is 9,has been on it past 2yrs,no negative effects observed just positive,if that helps at all!
rIK24KcHaa	How tall are you?|`|8SRjELNBaa	link = 12 work weekout for beginners, give it a look & brows around the site & forums.|`|eMXIQaQlaa	You probably already have a high metabolism and that's a good thing so don't try to slow it down.<br>  <br>  Eat more meals everyday, like I'm talking around 6 per day. Sneak in a meal between breakfast and lunch and 2 in the afternoon and one before bed. Make them reasonably sized. I would recommend following the suggested serving size on all the containers of food. Eat a VARIETY of things. It might be beneficial for you to buy some whey protein powder, mix it with milk and have that for a meal once or twice a day with a piece of fruit. It's easy to make and most protein powders taste pretty good if you mix them with milk. Protein is what you need to be eating more of if you're looking to gain some muscle.<br>  <br>  Some examples of good foods to eat that are also high in calories/protein/fiber/etc.<br>  <br>  Oatmeal<br>  Fruit <br>  Vegetables<br>  Protein powder<br>  Lean meats (chicken, turkey, steak, fish, tuna)<br>  Whole grain bread/bagels/pasta<br>  Brown rice<br>  Peanut butter<br>  Cottage cheese<br>  Milk<br>  Yogurt<br>  And drink more water all the time and a sports drink like Gatorade/ Powerade while you're working out intensely.<br>  <br>  Start lifting and running or jogging. Even if you dont want bulky muscle you can do lower weight (5-25lbs) and do high reps (10-30) or as many as you can before failure. Get a personal trainer if you can afford it, even if you only have them train you one or two times you can learn a lot if you're new to weights or go to the gym with a friend who knows how to workout. Even running will develop your leg muscles and put on size after a while. If I were you, I'd get a friend to go get a gym membership with you and it would be good for you. You'd be able to bond with someone, get a new hobby, and work toward a goal. <br>  <br>  Take your measurements down in a notebook and then measure your arms, legs, calves, etc every couple of weeks. You can find tips/workouts at websites like bodybuilding.com (even if you dont want a bodybuilder type body) or even in fitness magazines. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1JsWMX0daa	you need to slightly adjust your diet and add a simple excercise routine<br>  <br>  1- increase fat, protein, and carbohydrate intake. eat a good mix of fruits and vegtables. increase fluid intake & drink lots of water, that will help you put on good weight.

I'm 24 and I've weighed 105 ever since I was like 14? The most I ever weighed was 120 pounds when I was 18. The reason is because I was in the military and I was on a schedule were I ate 3 meals a day breakfast, lunch, and dinner and I exercised on top of it. That helped me gain muscle weight and it actually looked really good on me. But when I came home I lost it all. I think people like us have to exercise and not cardio but like sit ups, push ups, jogging, that kind of exercise and eat 3 regular meals a day in order to maintain a decent weight. Other friends I know who were in the military on that schedule gained weight but when they stopped they lost it all. I know for sure that's the only thing that works for me because when I drink fattening shakes, eat a lot, sleep a lot like you and I've even tried weight gainer, ensure, all that and it doesn't work. But when I attempt muscle building exercises I always start to thicken up. I can't keep up the 3 meals a day and exercise now cause I don't have a lot of time like i used too. But I know if I did it would help and I say you should give it a shot too. Hope this helps.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you want to eat healthy, try low fat, high protein, low carb diet.  Eat meat like chicken, fish and turkey, never fried, either grilled or baked.  Eat low fat cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream, etc., to help cut the fat out of your diet.  When it comes to carbohydrates, avoid potatoes, rice, pasta and anything made with white flour, like cake, bread, cookies, pies, candy or anything with suger.  Don't drink soda with sugar, try tea, coffee, diet soda instead.  Do eat salad, green leafy veggies like lettuce, spinace, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, etc., because these are low glycemic veggies.  Also try to get fiber in your diet through bran cereal, fruit with the peel, whole wheat bread, etc.<br>  <br>  This type of diet is filling and healthy and will produce benefits in the long run.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|2wUq0LI9aa	Learn how to drop 10 lbs fast and easy <br>  with no exercises, pills, potions or lotions..

I love RItz crackers but they really run my blood pressure up.  Check all labels for sodium.  Also eat lots of bananas and other natural sources of potassium.  Start walking.  Buy a carrier for the baby and get walking.  It took me about a week to get my meds in my system but I take a different med.  If you watch the sodium, eat the natural sources of potassium and walk it should help.  This has all helped my blood pressure.

FBvFz9DBaa	I am  not sure if I am understanding the question.  What I think you are wanting to know is that migraines happen for no real known reason.  They have been linked to stress, genetics, and other illnesses, but the cause is still not precise.  My sister has migraines, and she can always tell when they are coming.  The day before the migraine she usually feels sick, a dull ache in her head and/or neck, slight nausea (sort of like morning sickness, you feel sick, you vomit, nausea goes away), and then the next day she feels like her head has been split open.  Even the lights hurt her eyes.  And she gets really dizzy.  Sometimes they are so bad that she can't even get out of bed for fear of falling over from the dizziness.  I hope that answers your question!|`|gsyhNAiRaa	1) Migraines are caused by a narrowing of the blood vessels in you head. For many people it can be triggered by many different things. Some people get them from intense physical exercise, some people get them from certain foods that they eat such as nitrates, others from smells. I get them from certain smells such as cigarette smoke and perfume.<br>  <br>  2) For some people they can get a warring before an upcoming migraine. For some it is a feeling of pressure in the face but for other they have whats known as an aura. It hard to explain but it's kind of like a flashing light in your vision that comes in different forms to different people, like seeing spots or a flashing light in your peripheral vision. I had an aura when I was younger I saw red spots and if they changed to black then I would have a full on migraine.

kGJND4lYaa	The root canal is the part of the tooth that contains the root branch and blood vessels. "Root canal therapy" is the dental procedure in which the root canal is cleaned out and replaced with non-human material. <br>  <br>  In popular discourse, "to have a root canal" means "to undergo root canal therapy".<br>  <br>  Your dental plan covers the procedure you had done and your dentist is either lazy (doesn't want to file the paperwork), confused, or stupid. Or worse, conniving.|`|qJ7zGecpaa	They're the same thing.<br>  And about the coverage, did you make sure you went to an in-network dentist? With a lot of insurance companies the coverage is less when you go to a dentist that is not in their network.|`|tGEMwgyBaa	I work in a dental office and you need to call your insurance company and see if they cover a root canal that is done by a specialist. Sometimes the insurance company will cover a root canal done by your general dentist but not by a specialist. The cost difference is huge when done by a specialist. The general dentist front office staff should have gotten your insurance information for you and told you that the specialist was not covered. They did not do their jobs very well. And the act of doing the root canal is root canal therapy. So as for the way it is worded on your insurance plan, there is no difference. I hope this was helpful. Good Luck.

JhJXKRkOaa	I've had two ultra sounds on my kidneys, had a reoccurring kidney infection in my left kidney.<br>  <br>  What I remember is you have to drink loads of water just before you leave your home to go for the ultra sound, you can't go to the toilet.<br>  <br>  the water is essential to help with the ultra sound, did make me feel sick was heaving a bit, you don't need to wear one of those gowns, I didn't, you go into the ultra sound room, lift up your top and pull down your trousers a bit, I was told to lie on my side, first the left side, which was the problem kidney then the right, then lie flat so they could do the bladder.<br>  <br>  then had to emtry my bladder, needed to completely emtry it and go back, they did the same thing again, left side then right side then flat.<br>  <br>  the ultra sound showed that I did have a kidney infection and not just a water/urinary infection, left kidney was slightly dis-shaped from the right healthy one.<br>  <br>  I have now finally got rid of it but have been told to drink more water and flush it out regularly.<br>  <br>  don't be scared,  it does'nt hurt, feels uncomfortable after you drunk loads of water, they will write you a letter telling you how much water you have to drink.|`|pxhS7ol6aa	You don't have to wear a gown at all! I've had a lot of ultrasounds and all they do is lift your shirt up and cover your clothing with paper tissue to protect your clothes from the goo. You should know you have to have a full bladder as it makes it easier for the sonographer. I've never had an ultrasound for a kidney but I really don't think it will differ. The process I would say will take around 15 minutes. Ultrasounds aren't anything to be afraid of. It's a bit messy and boring but it's nothing - I'd say that once you have it you won't know why you were worrying. :] Also, you have to unbutton jeans and tuck the paper tissue down and on your chest to, tucked underneath your top that you lift up.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Takes less than 10-15min.

They will tell you to take breaths and hold them for a few seconds.<br>  <br>  You will be fine.|`|IKakoOfyaa	It makes it easier for the technician and less messy for you and your clothing if you wear a gown (they do have to spread a gel around on the area of your kidneys).  You may be allowed to wear your underwear as long as it doesn't cover the area(s) to be examined and you'll be on your stomach for the procedure as long as they are only doing the kidneys and not the kidneys and bladder.<br>  <br>  It can take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to complete and the test itself isn't painful at all, although lying on your stomach for that length of time might get a little uncomfortable if you aren't used to it.
ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	Switch to Selsun Blue shampoo and get yourself a deep conditioner (many drugstore brands have these). After shampooing, lather on the deep conditioner (be sure to get it on the scalp) and then leave it on for 10 minutes, preferably with a shower cap over it and in the shower (the heat of the water and the cap will help it penetrate even more).<br>  <br>  Use the Selsun Blue a couple of times a week and a regular moisturizing shampoo and conditioner on other days. You only need to deep condition once a week. And don't use bodywash/shampoo combos... They're much too harsh on the scalp.|`|Mq0Ev5Qlaa	dont point up when choking the chicken in the shower
tGEMwgyBaa	Here is something you can do to help. Rinse your mouth out with warm salt water. Don't swish it back and forth, let it roll around in your mouth by tilting your head back and then turn your head to the right and left. Make sure that food doesn't get into the hole. So..after you eat, make sure you rinse with the warm salt water. Try not to spit it out..you don't want to cause any suction because it will pop out the blood clot in the hole which is what protects the bone and promotes the healing process. If you have sever pain on the third day it means you have a dry socket and you need to get back to your dentist ASAP. A dry socket is when the blood clot has not formed or has come out of the hole and the bone is exposed to the air and food. This is very painful so follow the after care instructions you should have been given by the oral surgeon. It will only take about 4-6 weeks to heal if you are taking care of the surgery areas.Good Luck I hope this was helpful.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	It shouldn't take that long - mouth wounds heal the fastest.  Just keep rinsing and try not to re-injure the area by chewing on harsh foods back too far in your mouth (ouch!).  It shouldn't take more than a month or two.

Also, if you wear makeup, us a light foundation that won't clog your pores. I use one of those mineral ones, which also covers the red spots really well.

They typically will have a high retention of fat and muscle, and a slow metabolism. Typically, Native American tribes and East Asian cultures, and Nordic cultures have been prone to having a gene to retain fat. This is hypothesized to be due to having to suffer without food, and going through harsh winters/summers for long periods of time. So the body adapts to keep itself alive. What is your heritage? It could be due to that.|`|GnOKExBhaa	yea i am. im only 5 ft 3 ind im 170
VawQJREMaa	gain some weight, but try to gain healthy weight<br>  try to doo some weightless training (push ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, dips...) and eat a higher caloric diet. However, it is better to be underweight than over-weight|`|g2h6qUUXaa	no your underweight|`|e8mlM1PXaa	it depends how tall you are. your not overweight at all though|`|UQxROBaKaa	I would say gain some.<br>  but not like eat junk food and stuff<br>  go work out and build muscle :)
03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	you need even more help with asking questions.<br>  <br>  how much do you weigh, how much do you want to  lose, what are your current athletic abilities (i.e. can you run or do you have bad joints) how much free time do you have, do you have access to machines or free weights ect.
AA11476749	It is loaded with sodium, and although the FDA says that the artificial sweeteners are "safe," they aren't all that good for you either.|`|AA11269060	Yes, diet sodas are bad for you.  Google it and you'll find tons of studies done that say the synthetic (fake) ingredient that sweetens it...usually aspartame...builds up in your body and is bad for you.<br>  <br>  Yeah you're not getting the added calories but do you really want build up of a synthetic, man-made product in your body?|`|ubPOjh0qaa	It alone is healthy enough, although it does leech calcium from your bones, just like any other carbonated beverage. But the chemicals in diet coke make you CRAVE junk food, and people almost always end up gaining more calories from junk food after they drink a diet coke than a regular coke, including the calories in the regular coke. <br>  <br>  So yeah, it's helthy-ish, but watch what you eat afterwards.|`|l7IdlcHSaa	it worse saw this on the biggest loser regular soda is healthy then diet soda yes diet soda has no calories but it has more sugar but there both still bad for you if it regular or diet it still bad all the time|`|JZMfUDylaa	yes It is still bad for you almost as bad for you as regular soda
fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	try switching up your exercise routine, adding maybe a new exercise class or program (such as kick boxing or dance lessons).<br>  Also, try exercising for longer periods then you did before. i.e. run for 30 minutes instead of 20. It'll help melt that last 10 pounds away. Great job!|`|2wUq0LI9aa	Learn how to drop 10 lbs fast and easy <br>  with no exercises, pills, potions or lotions..|`|5bHcozktaa	hmmm...I agree that this is one of those mystery's that almost everyone has a problem with. It's always the last pounds that are so difficult. I, personally, would crack down extremely hard by excessively exercising and cutting the cals...over 50 pounds? I'd be freakishly determined and just push push push all the way through. I am also no the expert though. Is it possible that you  are gaining muscle and thats why you can't lose? Muscle weighs more than fat. <br>  <br>  p.s how did you lose the 50 pounds? That's impressive! Congrats|`|OS24ICPRaa	i wish so badly that i could help you because i have the same problem...ive lost 15 and i cannot get the last 10 off what so ever! i even have gained about 3 punds even tho im working out.....good luck
ubPOjh0qaa	SWIM. It is the best form of an entire body workout, and if you swim for an hour a day you will burn around 500 calories. That with your current workout would make you see tremendous changes in your body. Join a gym with an indoor pool during the cold months and swim in a lake during the summer. Good luck! =]|`|7DVWC3Z5aa	Check this out <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/fatlossquickly" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/fatlossquickly</a> Hope it helps!|`|eGpal3YUaa	Do P90X!

AA10168889	They don't know what it is.  They need more information.  Or they might treat it as a fracture.|`|MC3C17F7aa	I don't understand scientific talk
VawQJREMaa	the premium muscle mass gain is around 4-6 reps, you will build the most muscle that way|`|WugvMAB2aa	even though there is alot of conflict on the internet from different sources, im sure this is right:<br>  <br>  for:<br>  muscle strength - more mass, few reps<br>  muscle mass - moderate weight, 12-15reps<br>  tone - light weight, 20reps ish.<br>  <br>  hope that helped.|`|nLLjlQcGaa	More weight, Less reps. and of course Protein intake. Protein is the building block to muscle growth. I would recommend intaking 1g per pound you weight so ur body will have sufficiant amount of protein to feed ur muscles after tearing them durring ur wrkout to rebuild them biggger and stronger.
NvtetB2laa	Detox diets are basically bogus. Your body has its own detox system, liver and kidneys. If you stop putting junk into your system the body will cleanse itself.  The best thing about this one is that you aren't required to buy some miracle product at 1000% markup, and it isn't going to harm you.<br>  <br>  Of course you'll lose weight if you eat nothing but tomato soup for 4 days.<br>  Not many calories and lots of water.<br>  <br>  And find out what qualifies your cousin as a "personal trainer". Is he certified by the state? Has he completed accredited courses?
dbgQgYscaa	I had septoplasty, the surgeon took out the septum, cut on it a little on a little table in front of me in the OR, I was semi-conscious, cauterized the veins and put it back. It's still a little bent and it took a long time to heal. It's pretty invasive and unless they use another septum than the crooked one you have, it may not work all they great. I breathe better and don't have to sleep only on one side, and I don't have sores in my nose like I did. So if you have insurance, I say you should do it. Maybe ask the doctor if he can put in something more straighter than the septum you have. Maybe they can't, I don't know. But if you're going to go through the trouble of doing it, I'd ask to get it as straight as possible  Good luck|`|1hciyvKdaa	Drs tell us when we need surgery, we dont magically wake up and tell them do cut on us, its just not done that way.  I have the same one nostil open more than the other its extremly horrid. I use breathe rite strips when I need to. I never asked about cuttng me up to fix it so Drs never knew, so I dont know if it needed surgery or not. Get saline nose drops, they are clean salt water and keep cleaning out that nostril to help it out.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	It's up to your doctor. If you are having difficulty breathing and sleeping then yes. But your doctor will not allow you to get surgery uneccasirly.|`|FoEfJovgaa	It seems likes its a big enough issue for you. Get the surgery and live/breathe/be happy!|`|R8VhFeEVaa	Most people are not perfectly symmetrical. A deviated septum is nothing to worry about, its not a health risk at all. And you don't want surgery unless you absolutely need it. Changing the shape of your nose will not fix your allergies at all. A deviated septum can come from many things, like breaking it one too many times, or cocaine use. No one looks good under fluorescent lights, they give most everything a greenish hue.<br>  <br>  So, next time you go to the doctor, ask him/her if there is an operation or procedure that would help with your breathing. But as far as looks go, its really hard to be a teenager, isn't it? I bet you're beautiful.<br>  <br>  I have a deviated septum from breaking my nose several times and its never causes me problems.
8jdoIz7uaa	you are doing GREAT man...just keep the work up and the ladies will be all over you....i would suggest getting some meds for your stretch marks, and once you get everything cleaned up you will be perfect|`|s34uBtKkaa	I would say yes. I know the feeling of feeling like you haven't lost anything. I lost about 40 pounds last year and I didn't feel like I lost anything, but people kept telling, WOW, you look great. <br>  <br>  Keep on trucking! You're doing great!|`|Hj3fPypGaa	lookin good dude, you slimmed down pretty fast, keep it up and then you will reach the wieght you want. good luck on your journey!|`|2c8a6775bb939b2b29b71a0fc4602df2aa	I would say so. lookin' good :)
YCmvBc05aa	It can be one of the following (but DEFINITELY NOT the ear wax):<br>  <br>  1. The wisdom tooth in that area<br>  <br>  2. Any other back tooth that might be getting abscessed. There is always a possibility for a referred pain.<br>  <br>  3. Totally unrelated ear infection.<br>  <br>  Therefore, you should see your dentist as well as your PCP for a check up.<br>  <br>  Then take steps accordingly. <br>  <br>  Whatever it is, early diagnosis will help.<br>  <br>  Remember, always taking one step at a time makes it easier to handle a tough situation.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about what will happen during wisdom tooth removal now. <br>  <br>  You can worry about that when the time comes.<br>  <br>  Good luck !!|`|wOecmtrzaa	Yeah, your wisdom teeth can make all kinds of crazy things happen.  Check your wax, but if you don't notice a problem (you would probably notice the amount of wax that would hinder hearing!) then get your wisdom teeth looked at.<br>  <br>  It only takes a simple panoramic radiograph to see if you need them out; the visit to your DDS should cost less than 75 bucks.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Even if you have to get your wisdom teeth out, it really is not bad at all!  Talk to your dentist and your dental assistant about any fears you have, and you'll be fine!

wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers! We should all be so lucky 8)<br>  <br>  I have been doing the crossfit workouts and they have shredded my body big time (removed my body fat).

6yoCcGBWaa	Sounds like you are having an arrhythmia of some sorts.  However, since you were not sent to the hospital, you can assume that your arrhythmia is one of the annoying kind and not the life threatening kind.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine was having seizures as a result of her irregular heartbeat, something you might mention to the doc during your exam.<br>  They couldn't figure out what was causing her to seize, and eventually discovered that it was originating with her heart.<br>  <br>  You probably do have something wacky going on with your heart, but wait until you get a diagnosis, before you worry yourself over it.|`|NuvKPl3naa	if that happened again can you go to the ER. i would if you could. it may be anxiety to a heart mur mur. i dont think anyone can say for sure but your dr. good luck to you, try to relax and take care. i wish i could help more. mine does that but its anxiety. dizziness and fatigue too.|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	maybe your parents should take you to the ER  when your having this<br>  and not wait on the military|`|UlJmcDXyaa	Have them check your lungs.

UL3XOKJxaa	You should have followed the endodontist advice and had the crown placed. Since you didn't, you will now most likely lose the tooth you had the root canal on and therefore it was a huge waste of time and money. The post and core that you describe is only for situations that require reinforcement and build up, not all root canal teeth need post. Sorry you are learning such a hard and expensive lesson.
