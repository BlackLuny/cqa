uQ5ACLioaa	Your first equation has correct x and y intercepts, and you would have made your life a lot easier if you had reduced the equation by dividing everything by 5.  You'd get x - 2y = 3. That means your y-intercept also reduces from -10/15 to -2/3.<br>  <br>  An x-intercept means where the line touches the x-axis.  It'll touch the x-axis when y = 0.  To find your x-intercept, you have to make y = 0 and solve.  It's the opposite for the y-intercept.  To find the y-intercept, make your x = 0 and solve.<br>  <br>  For the second inequality, your intercepts aren't correct.  For the x-intercept, you have to make y = 0.  In that case, you get <br>  0 = - 2x + 2<br>  2x = 2<br>  x = 1<br>  <br>  For your y-intercept, you make x = 0.  In that case, you get <br>  y = -2 (0) + 2<br>  y = 0 + 2<br>  y = 2<br>  <br>  Now, draw your lines using the x and y intercepts. For example, your x-intercept for the first equation was 3, so one of the coordinates to draw the line would be (3,0).<br>  <br>  After you've drawn your two lines, shade the side that works for the inequalities.  The common shaded areas are the solution.  However, the x>0 and y<0 means that the final common shaded area has to be to the right of the y-axis and below the x-axis.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|1a481b66808b6bd1e98ccc39b8f0eb7eaa	aha..is it your home work ...give try and share your answer with us.|`|AA11472190	system of inequalities:<br>  5x-10y<15<br>  y<-2x+2<br>  x>0<br>  y<0<br>  <br>  -------<br>  <br>  5x-10y=15 and from the second inequality: y=-2x+2<br>  <br>  you should replace y in the first inequality with -2x+2 from the second one. then you will have: 5x-10(-2x+2)=15<br>  therefore: 5x +20x-20=15<br>  and you will have: 25x=35 which means: x=7/5<br>  then you should put the amount of x in one of the inequalities to find the amount of y. from the second inequality you have: y= 4/5

jh6YZ2NXaa	nononononono  i  compiti  si  fanno  da  soli  lo  dico  alla  mamma|`|2or2JNLUaa	A Roma Valentina, una dodicenne soprannominata Pippi, figlia di Cinthya e Marcello arricchiti ma senza ideali, in seguito ad un attacco di epilessia viene ricoverata nel reparto di neuropsichiatria infantile. Un giovane psichiatra, Arturo - appena uscito da una crisi coniugale che sta sforzandosi di esorcizzare - sebbene convinto che il caso sia piuttosto di natura neurologica che psichiatrica, accoglie la ragazzina nel suo reparto, preso da spontaneo interesse per lei. Pippi rivela subito un carattere scontroso e provocatorio, e risulta in difficile rapporto con i genitori, per cui Arturo si propone di tentare con lei una terapia analitica, studiandone attentamente le reazioni al fine di riportarla alla normalità.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ispirato all'esperienza di Marco Lombardo Radice, neuropsichiatra innovativo, il terzo film della giovane regista ha avuto un grande successo di pubblico e molta attenzione da parte della critica. Le strutture ospedaliere inadeguate, nel campo della malattia mentale, sono all'ordine del giorno in Italia. Sebbene il quadro negativo del film non rappresenti che un decimo del problema reale, l'operazione si può dire riuscita, se non altro per una sensibilizzazione verso il problema. Le ingenuità della sceneggiatura sono compensate da un'ottima interpretazione di Castellitto e dall'agile regia della Archibugi. Arturo è un medico di neuropsichiatria infantile sempre sottoposto a uno stress sul lavoro e con una sua crisi esistenziale. Conosce Pippi, una giovane epilettica, che ha bisogno d'aiuto. La madre, abituata alle cure convenzionali, fatica a capire il metodo di Arturo. Ma è quest'ultimo ad avere ragione: Pippi è ammalata per problemi psicologici. E la sua famiglia non ne è estranea.|`|TMIPN46Caa	nn l'ho mai sentito!|`|DwxGHKkxaa	<a href="http://www.municipio.re.it/cinema/catfilm.nsf/PES_PerTitolo/4F42035D329974CCC1256C0F005088B8?opendocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.municipio.re.it/cinema/catfil...</a><br>  <br>  p.s:10 punti please|`|EMWOysgCaa	t accendo la stellina<br>  QLKN RISPONDA QUA X FAVORE... è IMPORTANTE<br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmEfkaRiFRypCCFuh0QpKlHwDQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080325110005AAFSOLR">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|LyCPJsPNaa	<a href="http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recensione.asp?id=10920" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recens...</a><br>  qst è un sito... puoi trovare tutto quello che stai cercando... ciao!!!|`|6s1ggmShaa	trovi tutto quì--> <a href="http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recensione.asp?id=10920" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recens...</a>|`|CKo0frEVaa	Titolo originale:  Il grande cocomero<br>  Lingua originale:  {{{linguaoriginale}}}<br>  Paese:  Italia/Francia<br>  Anno:  1993<br>  Durata:  102'<br>  Colore:  colore<br>  Audio:  sonoro<br>  Rapporto:  {{{ratio}}}<br>  Genere:  drammatico<br>  Regia:  Francesca Archibugi<br>  Soggetto:  Francesca Archibugi<br>  Sceneggiatura:  Francesca Archibugi<br>  Produttore:  {{{nomeproduttore}}}<br>  Produttore esecutivo:  {{{produttoreesecutivo}}}<br>  Casa di produzione:  {{{casaproduzione}}}<br>  Distribuzione (Italia):  {{{distribuzioneitalia}}}<br>  Storyboard:  {{{nomestoryboard}}}<br>  Art director:  {{{nomeartdirector}}}<br>  Character design:  {{{nomecharacterdesign}}}<br>  Mecha design:  {{{nomemechadesign}}}<br>  Animatori:  {{{nomeanimatore}}}<br>  Interpreti e personaggi<br>  <br>      * Sergio Castellitto: Arturo<br>      * Alessia Fugardi: Valentina 'Pippi' Diotallevi<br>      * Anna Galiena: Cinthya Diotallevi (mamma di Pippi)<br>      * Armando De Razza: Marcello (papà di Pippi)<br>      * Silvio Vannucci: Gianni<br>      * Alessandra Panelli: Fiorella<br>      * Victor Cavallo: Don Annibale<br>      * Laura Betti: Aida<br>      * Lidia Broccolino: Laura<br>      * Gigi Reder: Turcati<br>  <br>  Doppiatori originali:<br>  {{{nomedoppiatorioriginali}}}<br>  Doppiatori italiani:<br>  {{{nomedoppiatoriitaliani}}}<br>  Episodi:<br>  Fotografia:  Paolo Carnera<br>  Montaggio:  Roberto Missiroli<br>  Effetti speciali:  <br>  Musiche:  Roberto Gatto, Battista Lena<br>  Tema musicale:  {{{temamusicale}}}<br>  Scenografia:  Livia Borgognoni<br>  Costumi:  {{{nomecostumista}}}<br>  Trucco:  {{{nometruccatore}}}<br>  Sfondi:  {{{nomesfondo}}}<br>  Premi:<br>  <br>      * 3 David di Donatello 1993: "miglior film", "miglior sceneggiatura", "migliore attore protagonista" (Sergio Castellitto)<br>      * 3 Nastri d'Argento 1993: "miglior soggetto originale", "miglior sceneggiatura", "migliore produttore" (Fulvio Lucisano, Leo Pescarolo e Guido De Laurentiis)<br>  <br>  Sequel:  {{{nomesequel}}}<br>  Si invita a seguire le linee guida del Progetto Film|`|VCa6GuDiaa	Prova a vedere qui..<a href="http://www.film.it/cinema/schedafilm.php?id=50707...oppure" rel="nofollow">http://www.film.it/cinema/schedafilm.php...</a> qui...<a href="http://www.35mm.it/film/scheda.jsp?idFilm=4213" rel="nofollow">http://www.35mm.it/film/scheda.jsp?idFil...</a>|`|VyFhqWD0aa	<a href="http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recensione.asp?id=10920" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recens...</a>|`|hX0FaZByaa	studiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.furbi siete !usate yahoo per farvi fare i compiti! ma mettetivi a studiiare! pelandroni|`|iHzZB73kaa	<a href="http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recensione.asp?id=10920" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recens...</a>|`|iiSOXTeXaa	<a href="http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recensione.asp?id=10920" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/recens...</a>|`|irsHFYNmaa	Il Grande Cocomero<br>  CastSilvio Vannucci, Anna Galiena, Alessia Fugardi, Sergio Castellitto, Laura Betti, Lidia Broccolino, Victor Cavallo, Alessandra Panelli <br>  RegiaFrancesca Archibugi <br>  SceneggiaturaFrancesca Archibugi <br>  GeneriDrammatico, Psicologico<br>  Distribuito daITALIAN INTERNATIONAL FILM - SKORPION ENTERTAINMENT, L' UNITA' VIDEO<br>  <br>  "IL GRANDE COCOMERO" Trama<br>  A Roma Valentina, una dodicenne soprannominata Pippi, figlia di Cinthya e Marcello arricchiti ma senza ideali, in seguito ad un attacco di epilessia viene ricoverata nel reparto di neuropsichiatria infantile. Un giovane psichiatra, Arturo - appena uscito da una crisi coniugale che sta sforzandosi di esorcizzare - sebbene convinto che il caso sia piuttosto di natura neurologica che psichiatrica, accoglie la ragazzina nel suo reparto, preso da spontaneo interesse per lei. Pippi rivela subito un carattere scontroso e provocatorio, e risulta in difficile rapporto con i genitori, per cui Arturo si propone di tentare con lei una terapia analitica, studiandone attentamente le reazioni al fine di riportarla alla normalità. Nota così che nell'ambiente familiare, superficiale e contraddittorio, perché contemporaneamente protettivo ma di reciproca indifferenza, Pippi non trova né sicurezza né affetto, e viene praticamente lasciata sola a se stessa, mentre nel reparto da lui diretto, malgrado le carenze strutturali e organizzative e l'insufficienza di personale la ragazzina trova interessi e affetto, specie nel terapista - al quale piano piano si apre con crescente fiducia - e in una bimba cerebrolesa cui dedica il proprio tempo e le proprie attenzioni. Sarà proprio la morte della bimba - cui non è forse estranea una terapia troppo intensiva - a scatenare il rifiuto di Pippi nei confronti di Arturo e a indurla a un'autocrisi epilettica di protesta, che fornirà allo psichiatra la chiave di un appropriato intervento per condurre Pippi alla guarigione.<br>  <br>  <br>  Note<br>  Questa è la scheda del film, che è tratto da un romanzo di Federigo Tozzi, scrittore senese.

PHsrITPQaa	I was like you in highschool. I could never motivate myself to study. Do as much work as you can during school. Always have notes or flashcards or something you can do when you're not doing anything in your other classes.

If you're learning out of a text book, google the text book and there are loads or premade notes for just about everything. I hope this helps.|`|6ae2f072d1aa4c5ad3b45f388352d5fbaa	Studying is really hard when you don't like the subject.

gagnaMFuaa	Dont carry a backpack its easyer just to have a sprial notebook, folder ect for each class, label the front, and set em up in your locker, just keep a pencil and or pen in your pocket, if u text in class u should get into the habit of putting a phone in the pocket away from the teaches desk, aslo if your a chick carry whatever else u want in a purse, if your a dude put whatever else in a string bag, either way by the end of the year ull end up just doin the notebook thing, also its good 2 join some type of sports team|`|Dh0JX2Onaa	Pen, pencils, erasers , notebooks, assignment pad, small stapler./|`|5gG2OfHIaa	I would think of the items that cannot be borrowed.  Your own cup and toothbrush if you attend a school where the facilities are clean enough to permit brushing after lunch.  My reaction as an adult is to think in terms of what you should not include in your backpack.  I advise that you avoid packing any object that could be construed or mistaken as potential weapon.  If you plan to take your lunch, choose plastic eating implements.  The thinking would be to avoid an unfortunate misunderstanding from the school faculty.  Guess, the most important suggestion is to avoid taking foods that have a high spoilage rate.   I would consider a small packet of hand wipes because there is a great deal of disease transmitted by hand contact in a large, concentrated population like a school setting.  It is wise to make responsible friends to stay focused on studies.  But, I guess that is not something for the backpack!|`|PSaaCGeAaa	Hand sanitizer, tissues, agenda/organizer (either personal or one the school provides). 2 pens, 3 sharpened pencils, small pencil sharpener, small eraser. At least one spiral notebook- this way if you forget the one for that class, you always have the extra paper(I used to carry around a little fat book).  Hopefully you will have a locker to put all of your books and folders in. 1 book and 1 folder per class- you can color code them i.e.- red=Social studies, green=math, yellow=english, etc.|`|JlcPGqZsaa	just anything else you will need. like calculator. sharpener. but USE MECHANICAL PENCILS SO YOU WONT HAVE TO SHARPEN YOUR PENCILS!! and your phone. etc|`|gLaczzfxaa	books pencilcase a folder to keep stuff in and thats all of it realy

aL5fDMx8aa	how bout ''Aww thanks, that's so kind of you to say that'' - that way you're not really agreeing and sounding smug, but you're acknowledging what they've said and thanking them for noticing your beauty!!!<br>  <br>  :-)|`|0hSpsSByaa	Thank you.|`|oojO4WAraa	Just say "thank you" and move on.  No more is required.|`|VSiVFMiaaa	I always say thank you because i appreciate the comment-but just because i say thank you doesn't mean i agree. Whether your pretty, ugly or average, whenever you recieve a compliment it should always be replied back with a thank you even if you don't agree. |`|EMLPlesmaa	Its more of an insult. If someone says that, it means that you really use it that you're 'beautiful'. You really know that you are and really flaunt yourself, and use your beauty as a weapon sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Just say, 'whatever' or 'sure I am'!|`|W9GFv2VMaa	Yeh the last bit is so true. but you can say thanks. or just say Oh. or say i know?<br>  <br>  Oh Oh I KNOW !! say i wish i could say the same about you though!|`|jV99kgWbaa	Just smile kinda shy like :)|`|acdc709fa5e2d178190fdde18844e0a4aa	It's called modesty. Like someone telling you that you've done a great job and replying, "Aw, it was nothing." It's a bashful type quality. Politely, acknowledge the comment with a thank you. It may shock you to hear some people don't think you're all that cute, so when someone goes out of their way to compliment you- appreciate it. |`|NGwkbWRkaa	When someone pays you a compliment, it is only common courtesy to thank them. Whether you feel the compliment is merited, under- or overstated has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is really rude to give someone an argument (Waddya mean, I'm pretty? I'm drop-dead gorgeous! / Oh, no I'm not; you're just saying that to be nice. / Who me? No, my sister's pretty. ... all are totally unacceptable). Just say "thank you". |`|09434924ae4b4946daa1221acd7722e9aa	What wrong with just saying "Thank You"?<br>  <br>  I don't think saying that makes you look like you're conceited or anything. <br>  <br>  If someone gives you a compliment, whether you believe it or not, say "Thank You"! It will do wonders for your self esteem and make the person who gave you the compliment glad that they did. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|Noi62Kk6aa	I usually just say thank you.<br>  And with my friends I return the compliment and say "Oh your not too bad yourself" <br>  And with family, I say "I know" in that bratty annoying voice like I think I'm better but everyone knows I'm not way lol|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I always just say "thank you" or "aren't you sweet?" I'm not going to argue about it!|`|cd8ff0f053ce1a2e1b3303ea5ec2f1c7aa	You would say 'thank you thats sweet' and thats it or just simply 'thank you' would suffice.|`|AA11604755	I would just say "thank you".|`|3bLNyHIgaa	this is a dumb question|`|4G19TOq0aa	Say something along the lines of, "I'm just me, get over it." Or, as Democritas the Greek said 3000 years ago, "beauty without wisdom is worthless", but I'm worth more than that. Or, "you just don't recognise the depths of my gorgeousness." So called "pretty" women, in my experience, suffer dreadfully.Hence they should mate with ugly men like me lol.|`|i4U8qBPpaa	take the compliment graciously.|`|rmteMfk5aa	Tell them thanks and ignore the rest. I have to say that this is a strange question though.|`|FkdqA7vSaa	just thank the person. just say, "aww. thank you". simple|`|1fa5489afe2b1f70d8a291392b7d6e9baa	"OHH,REALLY, WHY THANK YOU."|`|4G1d42JVaa	thank you?

People with zero period start the day at 7 am everyday, same for 7th period who end later (due to sport).  Monday w/o zero period for block schedule starts at 8 am and the rest of the week starts at 8:30 am for my school.  We get 15 mins break b/w 2nd period and 4th/ 1st and 3rd.

KYRQNJtiaa	According to the Oxford English Dictionary (which is THE authority on etymology), the word repose was first used as a noun in 1509. At that time, it meant "temporary rest or cessation from activity, in order to refresh or restore the physical or mental powers; esp. the rest given by sleep."<br>  <br>  The word's first documented written usage was in 1509 in Stephen Hawes' "The Pastime of Pleasure." Here is the sentence from Hawes' text containing the word "repose" used as a noun:<br>  <br>  "I toke my leve,..And thanked Correccyon,..Of my repose and of her lovynge chere."<br>  <br>   However, because oral usage drives written usage, the word "repose" was being used as a noun in everyday speech before it showed up on the printed word.|`|117cf9dbf2de8dad8159bec6e48f64e3aa	Merriam Webster says 1509. They apparently got it from the earliest entry in the list of citations in the OED. The 1509 usage was from "The Pastime of Pleasure," by Stephen Hawes:<br>  <br>  "I toke my leve...And thanked Correccyon...Of my repose and her lovynge chere."

14cd5854512aa155a3db72d699734934aa	Teabagging is a term for the act of a man placing his genitals, specifically the scrotum, in the mouth of another person. It is said that the practice vaguely resembles dipping a tea bag into a cup of tea.<br>  <br>  The practice can also extend to placing one's testicles in the eye sockets or nose of another person, often as a punishment for the other person's drunkenness, especially when carried out while the other person is unconscious. A good example of such teabagging is shown in the movie "Pecker" by John Waters.<br>  <br>  It has also been reported as a practice in hazing among athletic teams, as described in the article by Robert DeKoven from Gay and Lesbian Times:<br>  <br>  “One such story involved what school officials termed a hazing incident, which involved three varsity wrestlers and three coaches at ... High School near Chicago. The school suspended the wrestlers and coaches for a hazing incident that involved the “tea-bagging” of several freshman wrestlers.  Cyd Zeigler Jr. reports that the incident occurred on a bus trip home last year on Dec. 1. ... According to the Daily Southtown, the three varsity wrestlers pulled freshmen, one by one, to the back of the bus. There, two of the boys held each boy down as the third boy shoved his testicles in the freshman’s face.<br>   <br>  YIKES!|`|1a05531188c380dfacdee771b2e1d7f5aa	teabagging is when a man stands over you and dipps his "ahem"<br>  into ur mouth|`|76255ecc584cd1006f1116e750d7ba6eaa	Awesome answer risa!

96fc45c3cb3db6b1c954f5995755ef29aa	Well, those pesky logic problems are outta there! I remember looking at them in freshman year, scratching my head and praying that I did well. (For example, shoe is to feet as hat is ___, but trust me, they're a LOT harder than that!)<br>  <br>  Now that I've taken it I would say that they really just expanded the amount of material to test us on. I wouldn't say it's harder or easier.<br>  <br>  The essay is a creature unto its own. If you have an expansive amount of books that you read during highschool, you should have no problem writing it and using whopping support for your points. Really, the best way to practice is by writing essay after essay-- but seeing as how you can't really predict what the essay is going to be about, you'll just have to practice neat handwriting (but you have to be fast!) and a good idea of intro-body-conclusion standards.<br>  <br>  Math and reading are pretty much the same... They can be tricky, trust me, they're no pushovers. <br>  <br>  Really, all I can say is practicepracticepractice. Oh! And take the SAT in May, so that when you get your scores, you can decide if you want to take them over again.<br>  <br>  Oh! (haha, sorry) And try to take the PSAT (practice SAT) to give you a rough idea of what you need to work on. It's the perfect preparatory tool on your journey to taking the behemoth that is the SAT. (Speaking of behemoth, you should also brush up on your vocabulary. The College Board manages to dig up some crazy words that were used only in the times of Shakespeare!)<br>  <br>  Good luck to you in your college journey! I just finished applications, so wish me luck too!|`|3b3db166e8f135696149752a57e21449aa	The questions should be about the same but there is an extra section making it a bit harder.|`|0314b7a167d34cf5ec12cf0dfe2d668eaa	It really depends on if you are good at writing or not. As you might have heard, they added an essay! YAYYYY!!!! To me, it wasn't that hard, but it's just because since 5th grade we were forced to write loads of essays. Anyways, their are a bunch of "bird is to wing as human is to_____." lost of those little questions. Usually, you get a study pamphlet.  And also, I recommend taking the PSAT  in eleventh grade which are the SATs but shorter and the grades don't matter. It's a practice. Good luck.

Because not only would the economy have to deal with the loss of all those consumers and workers but also the strain the disaster caused on the ability to work. Like if there were a fire there would be to much fire damage to just open your stores the next day. However if the people died due to natural causes say cancer or some other type of illness. The economy would suffer but not as greatly. And I think it would also depend on where the five million lived. If they lived in say L.A. maybe the economy would suffer as much as if they lived in Montana. Hope that helped.|`|7xLD3UDEaa	I think it would depend on who the 5 million people were.

Do not think upon it. Go back to it with a fresh mind and you should be able to jot down quite a bit in one setting. If you have idea's that surface, do write them down before you forget them. When you go back to writing make sure that you place thought into the idea's that came to mind. If they still sound kosher, then wonderful!!!! I actually put aside a novel that I was composing for about two years....this is extreme timing, however over the 24 month pause, I was able to come back with a bang and idea's were pouring out of my head......give it time...you cannot rush these sorts of things.

The night before, Rev. Parris heard some noise in the woods. When he went to see what it was, he found his black slave (Tituba) dancing around a big black cauldron (one of those big witch cooking pots). She was dancing with some other girls, including Betty and Ruth. When Rev. Parris tried to go near them, everyone took off except for Betty, who passed out.

66c488808c354a7157cc31ffb9e98fb7aa	A manager in an adult literacy program where I used to work did her masters through Walden.  She was very positive about the experience. As someone else remarked, no tests, but lots of papers and projects, which both help you learn and test what you know and can articulate better than an exam, anyway.  And even face-to-face grad courses rely much less on tests than do undergrad courses.  <br>  <br>  The only negative aspect (as far as I'm concerned -- she didn't find this negative at all) was that she was required to physically go to Walden for two weeks each summer.  That was all the vacation time she got, and she had to spend it there, at the time they set up.  I would have been annoyed, but she really liked meeting everyone face to face and enjoyed the contact.|`|9e4179cd3dbf6c33e8e2c0447b16a1beaa	I agree with other posters who say try a local university or at least a school that has been around for a long time (mine has been around since the late 1800's) and I attend their online school.|`|mQkfyKxyaa	bad no|`|3PMDw4YMaa	yeah... ignore "Patrick," he posts that same edSoup crap response in this section A lot... he's obviously someone who works for them or a spammer...i looked in his history and it's always the same response...<br>  <br>  anyways, i haven't had experience with walden university (or any online college, actually) but i don't recommend online degree programs...it's up to you though|`|g9c6s22Aaa	I haven't taken courses personally, but I've heard a lot about them. For instance, they don't do a lot of testing, just rely on a lot of written papers, which you have to send in. I wouldn't recommend it for nursing. If it were a business class, maybe, but I've heard some employers don't give send-away colleges (Walden and others) degrees the same weight as colleges you actually attend in person because there is so little testing.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you try a local college or university, which may offer telecourses or online courses, with fewer trips to campus.

AA10980727	Arctic Tundra: Plants<br>  Plants need warmth and sunlight to grow and reproduce. In the Arctic tundra, warmth and sunlight are in short supply, even in the summer. The ground is frequently covered with snow until June, and the Sun is always low in the sky. <br>  <br>  Only plants with shallow root systems grow in the Arctic tundra because the permafrost prevents plants from sending their roots down past the active layer of soil. The active layer of soil is free from ice for only 50 to 90 days. <br>  <br>  Arctic plants have a very short growing season. However, in spite of the severe conditions and the short growing season, there are approximately 1,700 kinds of plants that live in the Arctic tundra. Some of the plants that live in the Arctic tundra include mosses, lichens, low-growing shrubs, and grasses--but no trees. In fact, "tundra" is a Finnish words which means "treeless". <br>  <br>  Plant Adaptations<br>  Growing close together and low to the ground are some of the adaptations that plants use to survive. This growing pattern helps the plant resist the effects of cold temperatures and reduce the damage caused by the impact of tiny particles of ice and snow that are driven by the dry winds. Photo ? 2000-www.arttoday.com<br>  <br>  Plants also have adapted to the Arctic tundra by developing the ability to grow under a layer of snow, to carry out photosynthesis in extremely cold temperatures, and for flowering plants, to produce flowers quickly once summer begins. A small leaf structure is another physical adaptation that helps plants survive. Plants lose water through their leaf surface. By producing small leaves the plant is more able to retain the moisture it has stored.|`|08fe81404c6b0287902b420e920ee594aa	There are thousands of species of plants in the Arctic tundra. The plants tend to be small and close to the ground. This protects them from strong winds and cold temperatures. Some plants that grow in the tundra include lichen, short shrubs, sedges, grasses, flowers,  birch trees and willow trees. Cushion plants, which, also grow in the tundra, are types of plants that grow low to the ground in tight places. They are called cushion plants because they are soft and cushiony.|`|43cb83b01e0e331be35203115b784a6eaa	Few plants will grow in such a hostile enviroment as the Tundra. This is mainly because of a layer of ice just below the surface called the permafrost, which never thaws. This layer of ice causes all plants growing too tall to be blown a way by the wind through inhibiting the growth of the plants roots. Because of this only bushes and some reed like grasses grow there.These plants have thin leaves and low aerodynamic structures to keep from being up rooted by the frequent gusts blowing across these arctic "ice-planes".|`|AA12092526	Yes, I can.

1ea58c41c8d4e6552fe964bf24d2a325aa	The Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BS or BSc) are similar in some countries, in that they are the most common undergraduate degrees. In the United States and Canada, both degrees incorporate a general education component (matriculants take courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics). They typically require students to declare an academic major, take a certain number of elective courses, and sometimes have basic skills components (writing or computer proficiency exams), however, in countries not requiring a general education component - such as Australia - the subjects studied likely are different in each degree.<br>  <br>  The BS degree typically specifies more courses in the major (or cognate fields) than does the BA degree. The BA focuses on creating a well-rounded graduate through formal study of natural sciences, social sciences, and foreign languages. The BS degree tends to be awarded more often in the natural sciences than in the humanities. In the United States, the BS is often awarded in pre-professional academic majors more than purely academic ones. Beyond these differences, the variation between the BA degree and the BS degree depends on the policies of the colleges and universities.|`|wPD5lFCbaa	An AS degree in human services can lead you to a PHD.

KYRQNJtiaa	What about something like "the negative effects of lack of donation." In other words, what happens when people don't donate blood, or when blood banks don't have enough blood? How does it effect not only individuals, but society as a whole? Since your speech is supposed to be persuasive, you need to show why donating blood is so crucial. If you've already covered this under point A, then you could also use point C to dispel some common myths/reasons that discourage people from giving blood. For example, you could focus on how safe it is, how it doesn't take a lot of time, etc. In other words, use your last point to tackle counterarguments.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|afc7TKrBaa	Talk about the benefits.

3iytda0Yaa	Morphology is the linguistics field that studies the internal structure of words. It studies patterns of word-formation within and across languages, For example, it would try to determine how English speakers know that dog, dog, and dog-catcher are all related. It would also look at how we know that the relationship between "dog" and "dog-catcher" is similar to that of "dish" and "dishwasher."<br>  <br>  Phonology studies the sound system of a specific language. It describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages. For example, a big part of phonology is studying which sounds are distinctive units within a language. In English, for example, "p" and "b" are distinctive units of sound, which makes "pin" and "bin" mean two different things, even though they differ in only one sound.<br>  <br>  Syntax is the study of the rules that govern the way sentences are formed by the combination of words (or groups of words) into phrases. Modern research attempts to describe grammar in a rigorous way, and, for many practitioners, to find general syntactic laws that all languages follow. It doesn't really have much to do with specific grammatical rules, though.|`|AA10275128	mor·phol·o·gy    audio  (m?r-fl-j)  KEY  <br>  NOUN:<br>  pl. mor·phol·o·gies<br>  <br>     1.<br>           1.

33df6bf254fa01664bae7c2d9131b4d3aa	POP ART MOVEMENT<br>  <br>  Pop Art was one of the United States' major artistic movements of the 20th century - aside from Abstract Expressionism, it was probably the biggest. It actually was first coined in Britain in 1955 but unsurprisingly the Americans took up the consumerist cause with much greater effect and conviction, and became the pioneers of the movement. Pop art and pop culture refers to the products of the mass media evolving in the late 1950s and 60s and also to the works of art that draw upon popular culture - packaging, television, advertisements, comic books, the cinema. Pop art was the medium that made real the breaking down of barriers that had existed for hundreds of hears between high (old-fashioned) art and mass culture.<br>  <br>  In America, Pop Art is often considered as a counter-attack against Abstract Expressionism because it used more figurative aspects in its works. It was also related closely to Dada, an earlier movement (largely French) that poked fun at the highbrow and serious nature of the art world and also used everyday objects and mundane subjects. Warhol's rows of Campbell's tins of tomato soup are equivalent to Marcel Duchamp’s bicycles and urinals placed in galleries.<br>  <br>  The Pop Artists favoured commercial methods of production, not dissimilar to the subjects they were using, as it meant that unlimited reproductions could be made. And this is typical of the perio because Pop Art happened out of a crucial time - it was inseparable from the prosperous and affluent era post-World War II. It was a time of enormous economic growth for the States and America was fast becoming a voracious consumer-orientated society. It was the beginning of the age of commercial manipulation, celebrities, exhibitionism and instant success. It was also the beginning of the age of homogenisation - of uniformity in commercial franchises, restaurants and languages or dialects. <br>  <br>  Britain wasn't too far behind the glossy commercialism found in the States although the British artist's interpretation of the pop-culture was a bit more romantic than the Americans - a bit less brash perhaps. Our artists (like Peter Blake, David Hockney, Allen Jones and Richard Hamilton) didn't create giant hamburgers in the style of Claes Oldenburg, nor did they paint Diana Dors with quite the same consequences as Andy Warhol found with Marilyn Monroe. They found their inspiration from America, not from Britain particularly, and so to them Pop Art was 'an unhibited hymn to a civilisation half-real and half-imagined, a wonderland of pin-ups and pin-ball machines' (Edward Lucie-Smith). They were more detached from it compared to their American contemporaries. <br>  <br>  Pop art is lots of things that high-art isn't - it's mass-produced, it is expendable, it is low-cost, glamorous, witty and encourages big bucks, bright lights and big celebrities - there's no sign of the impoverished artist slaving away in a tiny studio in this movement. However, it's light-hearted sensibilities have been negated by some critics; Harold Rosenberg described Pop art as being 'Like a joke without humour, told over and over again until it begins to sound like a threat... Advertising art which advertises itself as art that hates advertising.' <br>  <br>  Is Pop art a serious comment on the contemporary condition – are the Pop artists cynical of the growing mass-media, material culture or is it simply just popular art – accessible, bright and glossy?<br>  <br>  Pop art in America<br>  Temporally, the British pop art movement predated the American one. However, American pop art is said to have its own origins that are separate from the British. The movement was a response to Abstract Expressionism. It marked a return to sharp paintwork and representational art. It was an appreciation of theretofore unappreciated objects and images of mass culture and ordinary commerce. In the American pop art movement the groundbreakers, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, were not actually pathsetters. Roy Lichtenstein was the most popular and one of the most consistent pop art practitioners using stencil-like dots to represent comics or later the simplification/parody of fine art from the vivid pop art perspective. Andy Warhol became the most famous American pop artist using a pseudo-industrial silkscreen process for painting commercial objects such as Campbell's Soup Cans, Coca-cola bottles, for portraying raging celebrity such as Liz Taylor, Jackie Kennedy, and Marilyn Monroe and for portraying the deadpan and banal. Warhol extended his artistic contribution to film direction yet managed to avoid social commentary in his art. James Rosenquist brought pop art to enormous billboard painting. Lichtenstein at times extended his dotwork to this grand scale where the artist's skill is challenged by limitations on visualizing a gigantic work while attending to a small section of it. Wayne Thiebaud attended to similar subject matter (common food) as Warhol and Lichtenstein touched upon, but with the meticulous detail.|`|5fae834da9e6f95480df969c1a264c0faa	How did you type your question?

AA10470797	Here are 30 quotes from the book. The book is VERY relevant in today's world because many countries still treat people the same way. Look for injustice, genocide, infanticide, and other forms of exterminating masses of people and you can plug this book directly into that circumstance. <br>  <br>  Quote 10 is about the change that overcomes people when they go through the fiery furnace and come out the other side.<br>  <br>  Quote 22 talks to how people are bonded when they are faced with calamity and the threat of death. Nothing else matters.<br>  <br>  Quote 26 alludes to reaching the end of your rope, losing hope, and eventual dispair.<br>  <br>  Quote 1: "'What can we expect? It's war....'" Chapter 1, pg. 4 <br>  <br>  Quote 2: "'I wanted to come back to Sighet to tell you the story of my death. So that you could prepare yourselves while there was still time. To live? I don't attach any importance to my life any more. I'm alone. No, I wanted to come back, and to warn you. And see how it is, no one will listen to me....'" Chapter 1, pg. 5<br>  <br>  Quote 3: "'The yellow star? Oh well, what of it? You don't die of it....'" Chapter 1, pg. 9<br>  <br>  Quote 4: "A prolonged whistle split the air. The wheels began to grind. We were on our way." Chapter 1, pg. 20<br>  <br>  Quote 5: "The doors were nailed up; the way back was finally cut off. The world was a cattle wagon hermetically sealed." Chapter 2, pg. 22<br>  <br>  Quote 6: "'Men to the left! Women to the right!'" Chapter 3, pg. 27<br>  <br>  Quote 7: "Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words. Yet that was the moment when I parted from my mother." Chapter 3, pg. 27<br>  <br>  Quote 8: "'Do you see that chimney over there? See it? Do you see those flames? (Yes, we did see the flames.) Over there-that's where you're going to be taken. That's your grave, over there.'" Chapter 3, pg. 28<br>  <br>  Quote 9: "Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed....Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never." Chapter 3, pg. 32<br>  <br>  Quote 10: "The night was gone. The morning star was shining in the sky. I too had become a completely different person. The student of the Talmud, the child that I was, had been consumed in the flames. There remained only a shape that looked like me. A dark flame had entered into my soul and devoured it." Chapter 3, pg. 34<br>  <br>  Quote 11: "[W]as there a single place here where you were not in danger of death?" Chapter 3, pg. 37<br>  <br>  Quote 12: "I did not deny God's existence, but I doubted His absolute justice." Chapter 3, pg. 42<br>  <br>  Quote 13: "I was a body. <br>  <br>  Perhaps less than that even: a starved stomach. The stomach alone was aware of the passage of time." Chapter 4, pg. 50<br>  <br>  Quote 14: "'Bite your lip, little brother....Keep your anger and hatred for another day, for later on. The day will come, but not now....Wait. Grit your teeth and wait....'" Chapter 4, pg. 51<br>  <br>  Quote 15: "I was thinking of my father. He must have suffered more than I did." Chapter 4, pg. 56<br>  <br>  Quote 16: "If it could only have lasted ten times ten hours!" Chapter 4, pg. 57<br>  <br>  Quote 17: "'Where is He? Here He is-He is hanging here on this gallows....'" Chapter 4, pg. 62<br>  <br>  Quote 18: "Whose was that tear? Mine? His?...We had never understood one another so clearly." Chapter 5, pg. 65<br>  <br>  Quote 19: "Whenever I dreamed of a better world, I could only imagine a universe with no bells." Chapter 5, pg. 69-70<br>  <br>  Quote 20: "'I've got more faith in Hitler than in anyone else. He's the only one who's kept his promises, all his promises, to the Jewish people.'" Chapter 5, pg. 77<br>  <br>  Quote 21: "Yet another last night. The last night at home, the last night in the ghetto, the last night in the train, and, now, the last night in Buna. How much longer were our lives to be dragged out from one 'last night' to another?" Chapter 5, pg. 79<br>  <br>  Quote 22: "We were masters of nature, masters of the world. We had forgotten everything-death, fatigue, our natural needs. Stronger than cold or hunger, stronger than the shots and the desire to die, condemned and wandering, mere numbers, we were the only men on earth." Chapter 6, pg. 83<br>  <br>  Quote 23: "I shall always remember that smile. From which world did it come?" Chapter 6, pg. 86<br>  <br>  Quote 24: "How could I forget that concert, given to an audience of dying and dead men!" Chapter 6, pg. 90<br>  <br>  Quote 25: "When they withdrew, next to me were two corpses, side by side, the father and the son. I was fifteen years old." Chapter 7, pg. 96<br>  <br>  Quote 26: "We were all going to die here. All limits had been passed. No one had any strength left. And again the night would be long." Chapter 7, pg. 98<br>  <br>  Quote 27: "I probably brought him more satisfaction than I had done during my whole childhood." Chapter 8, pg. 101<br>  <br>  Quote 28: "But I had no more tears. And, in the depths of my being, in the recesses of my weakened conscience, could I have searched it, I might perhaps have found something like-free at last!" Chapter 8, pg. 106<br>  <br>  Quote 29: "After my father's death, nothing could touch me any more." Chapter 9, pg. 107<br>  <br>  Quote 30: "From the depths of the mirror, a corpse gazed back at me. The look in his eyes, as they stared into mine, has never left me."

AA12110942	Mira, yo te puedo responder ahorita mismo, solo espero que esto me ayude a conseguir 10 puntos. Verás, como experto en el área de tabaco, yo te puedo ense?ar qué pasa con las personas que fuman tabaco:<br>  En primer lugar, el tabaco puede causar enfermedades cardíacas, respiratorias, tumores canserosos y afecta ceveramente a los pulmones.<br>     Cada cigarrillo que se consume contiene de entre 7 y 20 mg. de alquitrán y produce 80cm3 de monoxido de carbono, lo que hace que un 10% de la sangre que corre por nuestro organismo no llege al corazón, por lo que no bombea bien, y ahí es cuando empiezan los problemas cardiobasculares como la falta de respiración, falta de aire y grandes dolores en el corazón... a los a?os de estár fumando tabaco puede probocar una angina de pecho, el primer sintoma antes de un infarto. <br>    A la larga afecta los pulmones, lo que hace que el pulmón se deteriore causando un color oscuro en la parte externa del pulmón, mira estas páginas y verás lo que te digo:<br>    Este es un pulmón de un fumador y de un no fumador:<br>  <a href="http://www.paradejardefumar.com/imagenes/pulmones_fumador.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.paradejardefumar.com/imagenes...</a><br>  puedes chequear más información aquí:<br>  <a href="http://www.paradejardefumar.com/fumar/efectos-del-tabaco/" rel="nofollow">http://www.paradejardefumar.com/fumar/ef...</a><br>   ?por qué se ha incrementado el tabaquismo en Mexico?<br>  Bueno, generalmente el tabaquismo aumenta por dos razones:<br>  1) Por publicidad: Verás, cuando la persona mira a una persona fumando un cigarrillo, generalmente le dan ganas de uno, pero los mexicanos nucna toman medidas de sus acciones, por eso es que ha habido un considerable incremento en el consumo del tabaquismo en ese país.<br>  2)Por las amistades: Generalmente, muchas personas inician el mal habito de fumar por los amigos. Empiezan con decirte que un cigarrillo no hace da?o y despues vienen con que fumes otro y eso te va causando un visio, poco a poco, y a los dos días estás fumando.<br>   ?Con qué frecuencia atendemos casos de tabaquismo?<br>  Bueno, aquí en el hospital Ni?o Jesús de Madrid, atendemos muchos casos de esos, generalmente llegan 20 personas en menos de una hora, por lo que nosotros lastimosamente no contamos con muchos recursos para trabajar con este tipo de casos, verás, tambien es un hospital público, y atendemos pacientes con cáncer y problemas cardíacos también.<br>     Espero que te haya servido de ayuda... espero ese boto.<br>    Y recuerda, si tienes una consulta que hacerme no dudes en escribirme un mail a almail988@yahoo.com, que es la dirección de corre electronico que uso para comunicarme con mis pacientes.

14cd5854512aa155a3db72d699734934aa	GENERAL INFORMATION<br>  <br>  Inerrancy is used to refer to a text that is considered accurate, truthful, totally free of error, and without mistakes. It is often used by conservative theologians in Judaism, Christianity, Islam and other religions to refer to their religions' holy books. Since all of these books teach different messages, only one can be inerrant. Perhaps none are. Still, inerrancy of their holy books is a major belief of conservatives of many religions.<br>  <br>  Inerrancy is an extremely important principle. Within Christianity:<br>  Many conservatives believe that the Bible is inerrant, is inspired by God, is the word of God, and is to be interpreted literally. A believer has an obligation to follow its dictates to the letter. <br>   Many liberals believe that the Bible was written by individuals in ancient times who were promoting their own evolving spiritual beliefs, but who were limited by their tribal culture and by their lack of scientific knowledge.  <br>  <br>  Many liberals believe that it is important to go beyond their writings, and reject what they have to say on topics such as origins of species and of the universe, human slavery, the suppression of women, treatment of persons with a homosexual or bisexual orientation, religious intolerance, torturing prisoners, the death penalty, treatment of religious minorities, spanking children, executing non-virgin brides, etc. <br>  <br>  Much of a person's or a faith group's theology follows naturally from their beliefs about inerrancy and whether their holy book should be interpreted literally. Many of the intra-religious and inter-religious conflicts can be traced directly back to beliefs of inerrancy and literal interpretation. This is thus a very important topic. <br>  <br>  MORE INFORMATION<br>  <br>  The doctrine of inerrancy allows for the Bible to be written in non-technical descriptions. We must allow for a biblical writer to explain a natural event from the point of view of an observer. An example of this is dew falling.<br>  <br>  When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it (Numbers 11:9).<br>  <br>  Although not scientifically precise this is exactly what it looks like from the vantage point of an observer. We do not need to assume the writer is making a scientific statement about the nature of the univ erse when such a statement is made. Inerrancy allows for these types of statements – it does not demand scientific precision.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6GTEzElUaa	Hi Shaunee,<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  inerrancy–adjective  meaning free from error; infallible.

'Much Ado About Nothing' Don Pedro, Prince of Arragon.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Prince of Arragon<br>  is an arrogant suitor to Portia who chooses the casket that contains "the portrait of a blinking idiot". Arragon is excessively conscious of his social position, and insists that he is different from other men, particularly commoners: he will not “jump with common spirits” nor “rank me with the barbarous multitudes”. He meditates on the subject of nobility who have “the stamp of merit” and are “the true seed of honour”, deploring the fact that “low peasantry”, who are “the chaff and ruin of the times”, can be found wearing “undeserved dignity”.

d7f2c01962fe4f1fd4ed854d458d9f91aa	The very tight fastening of a bodice or corset, to which the word refers, used to be fashionable, though it was often uncomfortable or even unhealthy. It has been metaphorical for excessive rigidity of conduct since the 16th century. Ladies wore corsets which would lace up in the front. A tightly tied lace was worn by a proper and dignified lady as in "straight laced." The Puritans believed that tight lacing of underclothes disciplined the body, hence the expression and its association with a Puritanical type outlook.|`|JAAWNXjkaa	My guess that 'straight-laced' was referring to the corsets that women wore.  <br>  <br>  Women of a indiscreet nature did not bother with tightening their corsets  because it was easier for men to gain access. Thus the term "loose"  also became a definitive word for unscrupulous and unashamed females.|`|CxEeM9kMaa	Main Entry: strait·laced<br>  Variant(s): or straight·laced /'strAt-'lAst/<br>  Function: adjective<br>  1 : excessively strict in manners, morals, or opinion<br>  2 : wearing or having a bodice or stays tightly laced<br>  - strait·laced·ly /-'lA-s&d-lE, -'lAst-lE/ adverb<br>  - strait·laced·ness /-'lAs(t)-n&s, -'lA-s&d-n&s/ noun|`|OTw5zJLMaa	Strait-laced means - excessively strict in behaviour, morals or opinions, prudish. <br>  <br>  The expression was first used in the mid-16th century and originated from the corsets ladies had to wear, laced up at the front. Proper, respectable ladies were expected to wear tightly laced up corsets and these would be very rigid and inhibit free movement.<br>  <br>  Therefore a strait-laced person is very strict in their conduct, ideas and morals.

AA11601460	Unfortunately, I would say that a post-baccalaureate certificate is not considered graduate work at most schools. Such work is usually considered a graduate certificate. Post-baccalaureate usually means that the certificate was received after a bachelor's degree was already earned by the student. However, this depends on whether grad courses are used for the certificate. Some schools consider high 400-level courses and higher eligible to be applied later to a graduate program.<br>  <br>  For example, let's say you majored in Information Technology and earned your bachelor's degree. If you ultimately wanted to combine your love for IT and your interest in Accounting, you could receive a post-baccalaureate certificate in Accounting. If you wanted to receive a second bachelor's degree in Accounting instead, your school could require that you complete an additional 30-36 credits. On the other hand, the certificate could require as small as 15 credits.<br>  <br>  Additionally, a post-baccalaureate certificate could be used by a student who has a bachelor's degree in a program and wants to complete additional study in the same program, wants to receive school teacher certification in an additional subject, or wants to have enough credits to sit for an exam (CPA, etc.).<br>  <br>  So, it goes without saying, but a post-baccalaureate certificate is better than not, and will likely result in higher pay. Depending on the number of credits required for the certificate, though, you may want to simply consider a graduate degree. Some post-baccalaureate certificates are 30 credits and some graduate programs are 30 credits, as well. You wouldn't want to earn a post-baccalaureate certificate for the same number of credits that you could have used to earn a master's degree.|`|KYRQNJtiaa	If you will be tsking graduate classes to earn that certificate, then yes, it is considered graduate work. Whether it will help you earn higher pay is not as clear, since you did not give any specifics about your current career or what kind of certificate you plan to get--there is no blanket answer here; the answer depends on these things.|`|6UsslMOVaa	In PA i did Post Bacc.

fceff0ee3635e88acc3bd4620ef00ff3aa	I'm sure you'll get in, colleges love it when people show that they're willing to work hard and change. As far as a full scholarship goes, I won't say it's impossible, but I wouldn't count on it. I'm sure you could get some money, though.|`|841943b78cff7c2c6b60811aa6a6632baa	Usually when you attend a college as your last schooling, any future schools will want to know that colleges GPA, and not your high school.<br>  <br>  Since you have 4.0 GPA, you should be eligible for many scholarships (many scholarships require a 3.25/3.5 GPA).<br>  <br>  But it also depends what you have on you ACT or SATs....if you have very good score on either, then you can gurantee a full scholarship (tuition, room/board, and stipend).<br>  <br>  <br>  I was like you, where I messed up during my 10th grade yr and some 11th grade, dropping my GPA to 2.5.  I worked super hard that senior year and maintained a 3.8 GPA during the senior year....unfortunately, it only increased my overall GPA by 5 points.  But now that Im in a college and wanting to transfer to another college, Ive maintained a good GPA throughout.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Also, being in the top 10% of your college class can help as well.  If you cant get a full scholarship, most offer a certain amount per year, which usually will cover the cost of an average course load.|`|AA10019591	Well, you can't get better than a 4.0. I'm sure you'd get in. There is a link below for transfer applicants.<br>  <br>  As for scholarships, it is possible that you won't have to pay a dime, but unlikely. You'll probably have to get money from other sources besides the university.<br>  Some options: Americorps (18-24 only), UPS Earn and Learn Program, Community Service scholarships, etc. The links below should help. Good luck.
HDUZ53rfaa	The truth is, the only way to figure out which courses transfer is to contact the universities individually. Contact information to the school counselors is available on each university's webpage. It would be advised to get course outlines/previous syllabi before opening up that dialogue, but it isn't necessary. To complicate matters, each UC will have different opinions on courses, so you can't take the advice of one UC's advisor to apply to all of the other UCs<br>  <br>  But in terms of this summer (I imagine you need to make this decision SOON!), I think it would be best to take the Chem course so that you can have fulfilled the pre-reqs for all of the courses you plan to take in the fall. The english course can wait until fall, assuming that's the end of the road for your JC english classes.<br>  <br>  But, as a UCLA student, I'm making a biased suggestion of going anywhere besides SUC!|`|hEcsA8gPaa	I think you should talk to a college advisor so that you will know what to take.<br>  <br>  Here is a website to get started:<br>  www.assist.org<br>  <br>  The website will tell you what to take at certain colleges to transfer to almost any university

fceff0ee3635e88acc3bd4620ef00ff3aa	Well, just my opinion, but I believe that truly creative people will never be satisfied in a mundane career. If you really love art, follow your insitncts and pursue all your artistic dreams. You might not be filthy rich, but I bet you'll be much happier doing what you love than being stifled in an office or some similar situation.<br>  If you go to college for art, then yes, it might be demanding economically as well as intellectually.<br>  Anything worthwhile takes time and energy, in the future you'll be glad that you worked hard to acheive your dreams.

TNTFomKeaa	Benjamin Franklin suggests that if religious leaders ask the government for money, it shows that no one else will help them.

The blogger feels that when a religion or church group has to ask the government for financial support that it cannot get enough support from it's members or from it's God.

SrcoG7JRaa	I haven't yet started (our declaration of intent was just accepted - starting on Monday!). My reasons were many:<br>  The first and foremost is that my children are not thriving in school. They get their work done and are fine (excellent, in fact) academically, but are feeling very poorly about their classmates and social life. They came to their current public school this year after moving in with us - they're my nieces, we're currently in the adoption process - and have been unhappy with it pretty much from day one. The school (even in supposedly one of the top districts in the country) is overcrowded, underfunded and the teachers are trying their best but are simply spread too thin. Good students who WANT to work and learn can't because the teacher has no time to focus on good students while keeping the bad ones from taking over. 45% of this school doesn't speak English, they are constantly having to wait around for the bottom half of the class to be caught up. Both complain of boredom, and while my kindergartener loves activities (when they get around to doing them, that is), my eldest is being bullied by a group of girls and ostracized by others while the school does nothing.<br>  <br>  The second reason is that I feel that we - two university educated parents co-homeschooling - can do a better job with two well-behaved girls than one teacher can do with 30 kids - many of whom act like monkeys, cannot speak English, pull off their clothes on the playground or cut off girls' ponytails for fun. They're more free to learn and develop their interests at home than they are at school, where most of the poor teacher's time is devoted not to learning, but to keeping ill-mannered brats in line.<br>  <br>  Other reasons are a large Evangelical population at the school (don't want our kids to be indoctrinated or pestered by them - we're atheist/agnostic and don't like the religious presence influencing them - the invisible man living in the sky has no place in our life); more freedom for them to learn what interests them and be self-motivated; freedom to work above grade level instead of just waiting until the next year, and also get extra help on what they're behind in; ability to do more as a family without being bound by the school schedule; and a way for my kids to get to know us and get more comfortable with us as a family. School consumes so much of their time, and it feels like all we are right now is transportation sometimes. The school does not need to be raising my children, especially at such a sensitive time in their lives. I'd like for us to have more family time and for them to spend more time in nature than under the artificial light of a sterile and cold classroom with the vomit-stained carpet.<br>  <br>  The one thing I am apprehensive about is finding secular homeschool curriculum. I have found and bought a few and am going over them now, but science is always a concern, especially if we continue this in later years. I also would like a homeschooling group, but have been unable to find any but Christian based in the area, which is weird considering we live in the Seattle area - one of the most non-religious areas of the country.|`|RklASxmMaa	Sometimes i wished i was home schoooled, i believe if i was i will be a lot different. I Received a lot of bullying in my younger years, as a result, my learning was affected quite badly, but the on the other hand,  over time ,it did strengthen me up and gave me confidence to stand up for myself and fight back. Theres always going to be people out there who are mean and  find joy in hurting people. You can shield your children for now but when the time comes for them to leave the nest the harsh and cruel world may be not what they had in mind. They may too, be affected and disrupt their life.|`|uYz8ipcJaa	Hey I'm a high-schooler dual-enrollment homeschooling. (In both high school part time, and home schooling.  Also attending college classes.)  I hope my opinion helps at all...<br>  <br>  I just started home-schooling.  <br>  First my parents wanted to start home-schooling my younger brother, a high school freshman, who was struggling with schoolwork.  He was the social and cheery, yet sensitive, kind of person who gets easily swayed by other people-- and he acquired the lack of seriousness from his wealthy, happy, carefree peers.  He lacked focus.  My parents talked to teachers, helped with his work, and did everything they could think of to help.  Nothing worked, so they took the one of the few options remaining: homeschool.  He still goes to orchestra and clubs, though.<br>  He's doing VERY well.  He's re-acquired the ability to concentrate and enjoy studying.  He's more focused with his violin.<br>  <br>  Me, I saw what they were deciding on and I shouted out, "I want to do homeschooling too!!"  I'm sort of an opposite of my brother.  I'm antisocial and a perfectionistic over-achiever who turned depressed with an anxiety disorder.  I had a tight schedule of going to high school full-time, working a part-time job, teaching/tutoring part-time, full-time comission artist, volunteering, running and participating in clubs and band... I wanted the freedom of flexible time homeschooling will allow.  I can plan studying around other things.<br>  I also LOVE studying, even after I minus the perfectionist part.  I always finish my math textbook in two months (takes the class one year) and work ahead weeks in science.  I also wanted to take chemistry and physics and classical literature, but was rejected because the classes were full (I go to a huge school).  Homeschooling will allow me to learn things I wanted to, without being rejected because a lot of other people want to too, and working at my own quick pace.<br>  I also found more time to work with my passions, art and music.  Go online: www.aquamoonstudio.blogspot.com<br>  <br>  Homeschooling is GREAT.  By studying in my style, I can learn more.  I boosted my standardized test scores in weeks.  I have more flexibility and fun.  I go to different places to learn (colleges!!) and get to meet a lot of people.<br>  <br>  That's what homeschooling was like for two different teenagers.  I don't know what it'd be like for younger kids, but when I think of it I wished I would have done homeschooling earlier.  I can imagine all the things I could have learned and achieved but didn't (because I had to follow what the class was doing!) ... <br>  <br>  I wanted a learning environment fueled by enthusiasm for education, not competition.|`|eC5QIpnbaa	i homeschooled my kids. I'm a goldsmith and work from home so I can give them the time and  attention they need to  succeed, we did other things like soccer and swim clubs to socialize them and I was glad they avoided the bullying and crap that I went through in school. I would do it again. they got into college and are both successful in their chosen fields .|`|gJdebq7iaa	I started homeschooling my kids after a few incidences with the public school they were going to. Mainly the science teacher.  She would give assignments that clearly wanted them to give opinions on certain subjects and my daughter at that time a 4th grader would she got in alot of trouble because she believed in the Creation.  That was not what the teacher wanted the answer to be and after many meetings we pulled them out of public schools. Its really pathetic when a child can not answer a question that starts out In YOUR opinion...... with their opinion without getting in trouble over it.  <br>  <br>  After homeschooling I wish I would have made that decision much sooner!  They are absolutely THRIVING!!!!!!  Never would I have guessed they could do so well.  They get the attention they need and it shows!|`|z9n0Yk3iaa	My mother homeschooled me because I was very sick when I was younger and was kicked out of school alot because I missed to many classes. I am not social now and didnt have friends growing up. It seemed like I grew up faster and never really have childhood experiences.|`|a8IRxC4raa	Our initial reasons for homeschooling were to save our child from the effects of an abusive teacher and a murderous classmate.<br>  <br>  Our only regret is having her attend school at all.<br>  <br>  The benefits we see are endless.  The biggest benefit was watching a frightened child who wanted to die change back into a happy, enthusiastic person.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|3OlUzzumaa	My mother started homeschooling my older brother when he was 5. I ask her why she wanted to do it and she saids the min the nurse put him in her arms she knew she would never be able to let him go off and have someone else teach him. She wanted to be the one to teach him about everything. As for the whole benefits thing I think homeschooled kids learn faster and a lot more in a short amount of time. I'm a high school student right now and am taking college grade classes and I don't think I would have been able to do that if I was just doing to a normal high school.
U1nr0Bc5aa	It depends on where you are applying.  I teach high school and college and in high school, it normally doesn't matter because you have to start somewhere.  To apply to teach at a college, it's sheer dumb luck to be honest.  They aren't necessarily looking for experience, although it helps.  They want to see what you are an academic rockstar to be honest.

AA11348786	Even on a juvenile level, the system has the ability to teach future adults about the the ability to "eshew one group over another(the state vs. the juvenile)".Hopeful, this important third edict of american law and the ability of first contact(the police) will deter most juveniles from further abberant behavior against the aim of society and property.The drawback is the non-compliant behavior of those who are not affected by the initial contact. The resiliancy of the subject to overcome that intial contact, with increased resentment that escalates the abberant behavior, is the result of cause and effect.

YUcl70rbaa	"cost of capital" is defined as "the opportunity cost of all capital invested in an enterprise."<br>  <br>  Let's dissect this definition:<br>  <br>  "Opportunity cost" is what you give up as a consequence of your decision to use a scarce resource in a particular way. <br>  "All capital invested" is the total amount of cash invested into a business. <br>  "In an enterprise" refers to the fact that we are measuring the opportunity cost of all sources of capital which include debt and equity.<br>  How Do We Calculate a Company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital?<br>  <br>  We calculate a company's weighted average cost of capital using a 3 step process:<br>  <br>  1. Cost of capital components. First, we calculate or infer the cost of each kind of capital that the enterprise uses, namely debt and equity.<br>  <br>  A. Debt capital. The cost of debt capital is equivalent to actual or imputed interest rate on the company's debt, adjusted for the tax-deductibility of interest expenses. Specifically:<br>  <br>  The after-tax cost of debt-capital = The Yield-to-Maturity on long-term debt x (1 minus the marginal tax rate in %)<br>  <br>  We enter the marginal tax rate in cell C10 of worksheet "Inputs."<br>  <br>  B. Equity capital. Equity shareholders, unlike debt holders, do not demand an explicit return on their capital. However, equity shareholders do face an implicit opportunity cost for investing in a specific company, because they could invest in an alternative company with a similar risk profile. Thus, we infer the opportunity cost of equity capital.<br>  <br>  We can do this by using the "Capital Asset Pricing Model" (CAPM). This model says that equity shareholders demand a minimum rate of return equal to the return from a risk-free investment plus a return for bearing extra risk. This extra risk is often called the "equity risk premium", and is equivalent to the risk premium of the market as a whole times a multiplier--called "beta"--that measures how risky a specific security is relative to the total market.<br>  <br>  Thus, the cost of equity capital = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta times Market Risk Premium).<br>  <br>  2. Capital structure. Next, we calculate the proportion that debt and equity capital contribute to the entire enterprise, using the market values of total debt and equity to reflect the investments on which those investors expect to earn a minimum return.<br>  <br>  3. Weighting the components. Finally, we weight the cost of each kind of capital by the proportion that each contributes to the entire capital structure. This gives us the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), the average cost of each dollar of cash employed in the business.

Initially I was thinking about studying from home only but also had the desire to study at a suitable institute.<br>  <br>  Before I enrolled here, my parents did a comparison with other online schools, their fees and the rest they had to offer.<br>  <br>  They even have a dedicated phone number for parents to call and ask for information. I’ve completed a couple of courses so far including Math subjects and soon I’ll be going through the rest of my high school diploma courses.<br>  <br>  The courses are engaging so far and Must has a completely online classroom with study material free of cost and you don’t need to spend money on books.<br>  <br>  I’ll be receiving my high school diploma soon, but I’ll have to clear the assessments first, the exams for each course with a good GPA. Anyway, my point is, it’s a good school and I can call them up anytime I want for help or any question and their counselors help me out.

AA10023710	So long as your partying doesn't impact your grades, and so long as you don't get arrested for anything, you could be fine. But if you want med school, your priority needs to be your classwork, and not the parties. If you notice that your partying is making you skip class, or procrastinate on work, or if your grades aren't as high as they need to be, then pause and reassess.<br>  <br>  While you're thinking through all that, keep in mind that if med school is your goal, you need to keep your overall GPA up around a 3.6, and to do very well in some very difficult science and math classes. Make sure you strike the appropriate balance between the social and the academic.|`|vyVDWIehaa	Yes you can.  I know many people who are doctors and a few of them partied pretty hard in college.

VkWVV1SDaa	OK, you need to look at it this way<br>  The room is 25.  Each man has paid a share equalling 8.33 for the room which comes to 25 (24.99).  The waiter gives each one back 1 so their share now is 9.33 or 28 (27.99).  The waiter keeps 2 equalling 30.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	It's an example of misdirection.  The receptionist still has ￡25, the three men got ￡3 back and the waiter kept ￡2.  That still adds up to ￡30.  <br>  <br>  The ￡27 they paid and the ￡3 they got back also still add up to ￡30.  <br>  <br>  The misleading part is adding the ￡27 and the ￡2, which sounds like a meaningful sum but it isn't.  <br>  <br>  To look at it another way, they paid ￡27, of which the receptionist has ￡25 and the waiter has ￡2.  That adds up to ￡27, so nothing is missing.|`|a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	This is not really tricky at all.  The ￡2 that the crooked waiter kept means that each man did indeed pay ￡9 apiece.  But then add in the ￡1 which each man received back, and you get this:<br>  <br>  3 (￡9) + 3 (￡1) = 3 (￡10) = ￡30.<br>  <br>  So no money has mysteriously vanished.

mj6lyMqYaa	Yes. There is a latin term, "in loco parentis" which means 'in place of a parent'.  It allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties.  As long as there is probable cause, school officials have the right to search your phone, your locker, your back pack/purse, your car (if on school grounds), pretty much anything you have on you. <br>  <br>  There have only been a few instances where courts have found student's civil liberties as being violated.  The most popular example would be the father who sued a school district for forcing his child to say the pledge of allegiance and therefore teachers cannot make students say the pledge any more.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	yes.  it doesn't matter if you are your own guardian or not.  if you are not supposed to have a phone at school and they have reason to believe you have one, they can search you.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Sorry; you're not "your own legal guardian" at age 18.

At the same time,  you can figure out what you want to do with your future through temporary jobs or internships.  This path teaches you both personal and fiscal responsibility while giving you time to think things through.<br>  <br>  Even if you decide to do something that does not require college, at least you'll have your GED that lets employers know you have a basic college level education.|`|QSPfBcnBaa	If sitting in a classroom listening to lectures is not your thing then consider going to a trade or technical school and learning a skill like auto tech, electrical trades, plumbing, culinary, computer graphics, cosmetology, etc.  There are plenty of free career tests/questionnaires you can take that can point you in the right direction.  Try you local library or the University's career center.|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	Sorry to sound harsh, but how about a reality check and trying to get a job without your college degree?  Perhaps a few months of working at a fast food place would give you a boost of energy as you realize that you do not want to spend the rest of your life flipping burgers and asking people if they want fries with their order.  Perhaps looking into changing your field is in order, but the truth be told, the first year of college is a bit boring and repetitive as you get the fundamentals out of your way, so don't give up just yet, and try to think of the positives to help you get through this tough spot.
p7mTFGJyaa	I am an English major, also hoping to become an author. Creative writing is a great choice to expand you writing creativity, however, you may want to choose other writing courses, for instance, Fiction, Childrens Literature, etc(majoring in English includes creative writing as a couse).

That's where it starts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|w7si46xkaa	Fame is a by-product, just focus on the writing, whether its for school or just in your spare time. I'm not sure what your CW course involved but it is probably the most appropriate choice if you want to become an author. <br>  <br>  Just take any opportunity to write, it might be an idea to get a pocketsized notepad to jot down any ideas on the go. Keep writing, practise and you'll get better. When you do get to being published if its good then fame will come naturally. If your school has a paper or it might also be a good idea to see if you can write for them, who knows, might get you a little fame too.|`|5ith7Qyoaa	the courses can only take you so far. writing is something you have to discover on your own. people can teach you the proper or universally accepted techniques, but only you can make your writing become the stuff people want to read.

But like I said, you can take all the formal writing classes in the world, and learn all the techinques, but only YOU can take it to an amazing level.<br>  hope that helps =]

AA11535009	He soon found that when he passed electrical current through some substances, these substances decomposed, (a process later called electrolysis). In 1813, Sir Humphry Davy concocted a giant battery in the basement of Britain's Royal Society. It was made of 2,000 pairs of plates and took up 889 square feet. The intensity of its effect (the voltage generated) was directly related to the reactivity of the electrolyte with the metal. Evidently, Davy understood that the actions of electrolysis and of the voltaic pile were the same. His work led him to propose that the elements of a chemical compound are held together by electrical forces. Davy must have known of Lavoisier's suggestion that the alkali earths were s of unknown metals. At first, he tried to separate the metals by electrolyzing aqueous solutions of the alkalis, but this yielded only hydrogen gas.

r7W0HqbVaa	With colleges being this competitive, it depends what school you are going to. If you are going to a prestigious university, you would be put on probating (IF you are even allowed back in), if you going to a state school or university, you will most likely be fine and worst is that you will be put on probation, but I don't think that will happen. <br>  <br>  Stay above a 3.5 though, you worked hard your whole schooling, just push past the senioritus and make it to college!|`|a9YfUGzSaa	It sounds to me like you can't slack off at all, buddy.  Depending in the school, that's going to be a significant drop, and you definitely don't want it to be any worse than that.  They will be able to tell from looking at your transcripts if you blew off school once you got accepted, and they will not be impressed by that attitude.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	A primary information source means you would be collecting information directly from someone (in this case, probably through an interview with someone who experienced them rather than by doing a survey).  A secondary source was something that was collected for some other purpose, but which is available for you to use to the degree that it would be relevant to your needs.  Secondary sources include books, magazines, films, websites, etc.
eJJnXzNRaa	Well, I am actually going to attend there for the fall of 2009 and I know the school is very selective! It has a 32% acceptance rate! But if you like the school, then go for it. I personally think the school is perfect for anyone looking for a good education at a great price. I know it has one of the nations most recognized business programs, as well as great diversity and is extremely affordable. It IS a 4 tier school and some might say that its not as "prestigious" as other florida schools like UCF, UF, and UM, but college is what you make it. Maybe join the honors program which I hear is really good but tough to get in. And they got a new medicine school so its growing which means it is getting better. I personally LOVE the school and am thrill about starting there in August! It is like the perfect school for me in the beautiful City of Miami. So if you ask me... then it is a GREAT school.<br>  <br>  FIU! FIU! FIU!!! Go Panthers!!!
2rdXW293aa	Your third sentence was messed up - see all corrections, below. I took out some extraneous stuff that was making it rather repetitious. When you're talking quantity, use "more than" rather than "over." So - you're talking about both a print ad AND a television commercial? Because a print ad is never referred to as a commercial; that's restricted to broadcast (radio, TV) only.<br>  <br>   <br>  Advertisements for the local restaurant Buffet City emphasize that the food it serves is fresh and the best in Acadina. The Yellow Book Acadina ad for Buffet City features a truck in front of a restaurant. This ad suggests that Buffet City’s produce, seafood and other menu offerings are fresh and that the restaurant serves fresh food to its customers. The commercial further tells us that the dining room is elegant and clean, that both the menu and buffet super are large, and that Menu City offers more than 200 items daily. The newspaper ad suggests that Buffet City is the best in town, since it was named the number one restaurant in Acadina.<br>  <br>  Last line - rework so you don't repeat Acadina.

r7W0HqbVaa	I am by no means a music enthuasist myself, but I am great at interviews.<br>  <br>  You have many choices here, and you could say: electric guitar (rock and roll), the short wave radio in 1919 popularized the radio, in which we have listened to music, the ipod, which created a generation of everyone LOVING music of their own individual style and really personalized every single person--even one of the campaign questions of all presidential nominees of what was on their ipod. You could also say the tv's invention which gave light to music and created music videos, music television, and overall gave a whole new dimension to music. You could also say the invention of records, or cds, or the boom box which launched a whole genre of music for people, or pretty much anything else. Good luck!|`|KGXZ9APCaa	Was the guitar made electric in the last 100 years? Because if it was, you could argue that it revolutionized music. I would say that an acoustic and an electric guitar are different instruments. :)|`|o4y9d5Npaa	Would a drum machine be one? If so, could use that, as practically everyone uses a drum machine....For example, a band called Test Icicles (yes i know, weird name, amazing band though!) Anyway, they used a drum machine on their record and even when they played live....and it sounded really good...I don't know, thats just an example (probably wouldnt use that band name though in the interview haha!) Hope that helps.....a wee bitty!<br>  <br>  Ooooh, or a guitar effects pedal?? You could mention Jimi Hendrix and how it completely changed music??

yWbJYuGXaa	Maybe what you could do for the review game- maybe seperate the class into 4 groups for example, and you ask the question, and they have to write it down on a piece of paper and bring it to you, and maybe the first team to guess it right- wins that round, do like 5 rounds, and offer like dollar store items or candy as a prize for the winning team, but maybe do something for the rest of the class for their effort- some kids can get upset if they don't get something, but just make it fun and creative! 2nd graders need something entertaining...I hope this helps :)

6Gfz125Paa	Probably UC Irvine and UC Davis.  Maybe UCSB if you're lucky.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	Unless someone's parents have plenty of money it usually doesn't make a lot of sense to go to a UC out of state because the tuition is exorbitant, around 30,000, and not just the first year. UC considers that if a student comes to California to attend UC then he is never considered a state resident for tuition purposes. This is now being challenged in the courts. Unless one's parents have quite high income, private schools usually grant sizable tuition rebates which bring the tuition costs quite a bit lower than UC out of state. One way to pay for UC out of state is to apply for an nrotc or nrotc mo scholarship at the  UC's that have nrotc: Berkeley,  Davis(Berkeley nrotc), UCLA, UCSD(USD nrotc). I am not sure if  army rotc-Berkeley, Davis, UCLA, UCSB- will pay put of state tuition. nrotc and rotc scholarships pay full tuition. Most afrotc scholarships are capped at 15,000. Some public and private universities offer free room and board to cadets/mids. <br>  Out of state Median GPA at Berkeley and UCLA  is in the 4.4 range. In state is up near 4.2.  Probably stand a good chance at Davis, Irvine and Santa Barbara, if your weighted is up around 4.1. One thing to know is Davis has the lowest freshman gpa around 2.8 while Berkeley has the highest around 3.4. Irvine is around 60% asian and there is purportedly intense competition for grades. You would probably be admitted to Santa Cruz which has a beautiful campus and like ucsd  was designed  for undergraduate education. I'd also consider  applying to ucsd. USC could  end up being a lot less than UCLA depending on parental income. If you want to go to school in California there are other private schools you should consider: the Claremont colleges, USF, Saint Mary's, Santa Clara, USD, Loyola. You also have the type of academic record and extracurriculars that the service academies seek in students. Summer Seminars are still accepting applications. <br>  <a href="http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/nass.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/nass.htm</a><br>  Berkeley and Merced are on the semester system. The other UC's are on the quarter system. The fast pace of the quarter system  can present problems in Freshman and Sophomore years when trying to get certain oversubscribed classes because by the time a student finds out if he is in a class, 3rd week or so, mid term exams are taking place. <br>  Good Luck!<br>  re: Additional Details...Santa Barbara, Irvine and Davis are roughly equivalent in terms of competitiveness with Santa Barbara being the most competitive and Davis or Irvine less depending on year. The requirements for out of state are quite a bit higher. UC eligibility for in state requires a minimum 3.0 GPA, while for out of state a 3.4 minimum GPA is required. <br>  <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/undergrad_adm/paths_to_adm/freshman/scholarship_reqs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ad...</a><br>  UC's  calculate the a-g gpa using grades earned in a-g subjects during sophomore and junior years:<br>  <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/eligibility.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ad...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/undergrad_adm/paths_to_adm/freshman/subject_reqs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ad...</a><br>  You have not stated your weighted v unweighted GPA without which it is really impossible to state your chances.

pvezh17Maa	Check with your local school district or local high school as to what you need to do or if you actually can go back.  You are allowed to attend school in most all states as long as you are under age 18 and have no serious discipline problems.  Many schools now have virtual school classes that you can take to catch up in the meanwhile (so as to not be 18 in a freshman/sophomore class.)   Go now and check into it.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the good luck in the world and think you are very brave to go back.

I would take English Language though for two reasons: <br>  <br>  A) because it's general and broad and touches on many other subjects such as History and Sociology and probably Psychology too.<br>  <br>  B) because everyone knows what it is because everyone took at some point, even if it was only up to GCSE level.

lzEuuseJaa	Sure you can be expelled. It's probably in the handbook referred to in the contract your parents signed. No, it isn't discrimination. The school probably believes that whatever happened was your fault, not the other student's which is why you are being disciplined and the other kid isn't. Maybe that's not fair, but sometimes life isn't fair. <br>  <br>  The best thing that you can do is to apologize sincerely if you want to stay in the school. Even if you know you're right, best to do what will keep you in the school. <br>  <br>  You can always sue, but it would cost you about $10,000 cash to start, probably around $50,000+ total and you would lose.

There have been plenty of jobs for programmers, and $100,000 salary is not out of reach.

AA12178390	well assuming the goal of the school is to build well rounded students. Then yes school should expose students to these things.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	No, all students should not. Some students may be academic or athletic and have no musical ability at all.|`|ec7faabfad01fb70cf9da66d5b00110caa	Yes, of course! There are the arguments that some people are just more musical than others, and therefore the other students shouldn't have to take music, but that would be like saying 'some students are readers and some are physical workers- teach the readers how to read and the physical workers just how to move things.' It deprives a huge group the opportunity to become stronger. Music isn't a talent, it's a skill, and it needs to be fostered. Another point that a lot of people forget is that music is not just a performance skill. True music education concentrates on three major areas, music performance, music listening and understanding, and music composition. All people relate to music, the difference is is in how they relate. Some will relate stronger to music creation, some to performing music, and some to a deeper listening. Helping people explore and understand themselves musically is key to properly educating people.
tX4RNX1faa	as young students they should spend more time reading and learning to love reading. Then when sports do come along to them they can read and enjoy all that is written about their favorite sports. (this is a must during wasted recess time) but in middle school P E on up into High School P E, this will greatly enhance the sporting experience which too will assist in what will 100% mentally prepare them for 130% physical involvement. PE should (like a science) be both in the lab and in the lecture hall. The mental preparation to sport is never taught in school. It (to me) is what lacks in all today's students the entire preparation to everything. They don't read so they don't get the fact that you get out of something what you put into it.... The problem with young students not learning to love reading is they do not ever get that once in a lifetime chance at building a strong imagination and without imagination you don't have dreams or aspirations of grandeous excelling greatness. Only sports has that conquest in reach and yet those atheletes banking their ability will get them into college and then on into the pros never understand why they weren't picked or overlooked for a scolarship.

They alternate by three. So one day they go to music & PE, the next day they go to PE & music, and the last day they go to art & wellness. The difference between PE and wellness, is that the goal in wellness is to get the children's heart rates up for 20 minutes solid. There aren't really units and lessons, its continuous exercise through running, aerobics, fast-paced games, etc. where PE is taught in units (hand-eye coordination, health, kickboxing, etc.).

Check it out.|`|8s2Bybysaa	I think that it is a good choice. To do medicine/Dentistry is is required that you take 2 science including chemistry. Maths is considered as a science therefore you have met the criteria. Anf as for government+politics, take it beacause remeber if you dont get the grades you require to go into medicine then you have a subject to fall back on. Also goverment + politics is not a 'soft' subject, it is considered a very academic subject.

Yellow, when used in a space creates a bright cheery atmosphere. A lighter yellow is fresh and upbeat, while a golden shade can be elegant and regal and warm. Red can also be used in a number of ways to evoke emotions from a space. The individual emotions depend on the intensity of the shade.  A pastel pink is feminine and soft whilst an intense red is dramatic and commands attention. Both colors, when used with the intent to create an emotion, can be wonderfully powerful elementsadding immensely to the intended feeling of a designed space.<br>  <br>  <br>  2 A color that I feel can awaken strong emotions when used in part of a rooms design, is the color blue. Blue can evoke feelings of tranquility and peace, leaving the mind calm and serene. The blue can also mirror colors found in nature such as that of the ocean and the sky. The color can help banish feelings of stress and instill a sense of rejuvenation of the mind. Lighter shades have an aura of optimism and darker, more intense shades signify sincerity and loyalty. The various emotions evoked by blue and the calming effects it has make it a color that can leave you feeling refreshed and at peace.<br>  <br>  I hope this is ok, i didn't want to change it out of your words as it's a very personal thing, therefore i have just punctuated and changed the structure of some sentences, I hope you find it helpful!

zxQT3Uo5aa	word - spoilt.   past participle    I think if you think of spilled and spilt you have a better understanding of how it is used.  You heard of spilt mik as an event that has taken place but the focus is on something that you can forget about that can be undone.  The same is the way spoilt is used to mean that it is hopeless and can not be undone.  It is attesting to the degree of spoiling that has be done.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Common usage of different generations.|`|0093ec8ace66f00d94d7fb1fcb4edb3aaa	spoilt is a derivative of spoiled //people are lazy in their speech and the t was picked up by people who heard the words incorrectly..children learn their speech from adults ,but correct pronunciations of words are being ignored by the now young adults.

htSZsds7aa	The one not many are taking. U can always change your major later once in.|`|rSaD6d8Gaa	Get the highest score|`|AA12025366	None.. admissions to UF is all the same no matter what major you declare on your application.  It is not like other universities where you apply directly to the college within it from the get-go.. you actually apply to be an undergraduate at the university of florida and you fall into your college as you choose your major (which many people end up changing).  Eventually, after 2 years, you have to declare a major/college/program/track that is permanent.<br>  <br>  For instance, you can apply to UF and say you want to major in architecture.  UF will let you start doing architecture classes and after 2 years of staying on that track you apply along with tons of other people to stay in the architecture college which will only admit a certain amount of people, but they are already sophmores/juniors who can be judged based on their college performance so far.  Same goes for nursing majors and a couple others. If you dont get in you switch into a different major in a different college, like say math in the college of liberal arts and sciences, which can accomodate tons of people.<br>  <br>  The only discrimination based on high school performance as to where you are placed in UF is whether you get into honors or not which is a different application process entirely after you have already been admitted first.<br>  <br>  Please note all this advice is applicable for those applying to be freshmen (out of high school) and is irrelevant to transfer applicants.

That is know his full time "job." It isn't anymore ridiculous than other people will families that choose to go back to school knowing that they are going to have to forgo, most if not all, of their current paycheck. Perhaps this is not the best time to head back to school. Also, I'm unsure of your current situation, but when I returned to school my fiance picked up some more hours and taught tennis lessons over the summer to help keep us afloat. Is there anything you can do to help him until he finishes his certificate?|`|NJuV4vZXaa	I'm in a situation like that.  I'm in Ca and am going to school, part-time though, and I had a phone interview. I know that if you find full time employment you have to be willing to give up your schooling.  Until you find employment you can collect UI.  It may be different if he is getting training from the state.

0Iyqf6Glaa	I edited by answer so please re-read it.  The edit concerned the tense of the story (past tense vs. present tense).  The story should be either entirely past tense or entirely present tense.  Either will work, but since you started the story in the present tense I just worked it all to stay in the present tense.  This is in addition to the other edits which I had made.  The story is pretty creative so if you're being asked to write creatively, you should get a decent mark on it.<br>  <br>  The street lamps dimly light the rain-soaked streets of the small town in which I live. Terraced houses line each side of the narrow streets and the sound of raindrops on tiled roofs constantly drum in my ears. <br>  The streets are totally empty.  Not even the odd car or person breaks the monotony of the black tarmac. A rusty iron fence surrounds the small park by the houses and the play area is deserted and broken. The sky is dark and overcast with the occasional roll of thunder rumbling in the distance. <br>  <br>  By ten o'clock my shift at the local supermarket is over and I have to begin the long, mind-numbing walk home. The supermarket car park is covered in red, yellow and brown leaves from the old trees at the side of the road and I struggle to cross the slippery surface until I reach <br>  the dark subway that leads under the main road to the terraces. The subway walls are covered in graffiti while broken bottles and cigarette ends line the floor. I always feel slightly nervous when walking through this subway, as if something watches my every move.<br>  <br>  Five minutes into the subway walk my hands tremble.  I smell adrenaline combining with the smoke from the sewers.  As I pay attention to my surroundings I see shadows through the thick smoke.  There is a man standing right on the subway rails.  As the light of a heavy approaching train makes his shadow disappear, I stand there alone watching him.  A bright green light illuminates the whole place just before the train hits him and the man vanishes.<br>  <br>  I stand there motionless waiting for a sound of pain or agony, still thinking that the man was hit. When I get close enough to see if there is anything remaining of him, I find nothing but a black box. Not knowing what it is I pick it up and get off the train tracks. At home I try to figure out what had happened but I just fall asleep. When I wake up, I hear a faint noise coming from downstairs.  Is it the box?<br>  <br>  Armed with my baseball bat I make my way downstairs.  Like I suspected, it is the black square. It is glowing. When I reach to touch it, I see the same light I had seen the day before, just minutes before that guy disappeared. When I get ahold of it, I emerge to some strange world filled with colors and sound that I had never seen nor heard before.<br>  <br>  Astonished with this new world, I am filled with a new feeling that I have never felt before. When I glance back, I see shadows and space out. After regaining consciousness, I find myself running away from this bestial image. <br>  <br>  I find cover and rock myself back and forth trying to make some sense out of this strange reality.  I calm down and decide to go explore. I walk for hours without sign of another human or even anything close to human.<br>  At what seems like the end of the day I see some light coming from far away. I decide to follow this fair chance of hope.  I find a window to my room. Entirely disoriented I reach but can't get through.  I turn back to think what to do and there it is.  A black, frightening beast stares at me as if it is trying to get me. Only having two choices (run, or stay and see my ending) I reach to the creature that follows my every move, preparing to attack. When I get a good look at it, I see that it looks just like me. Meters away from it, I realize that it is just a mirror!  Still undecided, I reach out and grab his hand and everything goes blank.<br>  <br>  Waking up in my bed sweating from the nightmare, I wonder if what I just went through was a real or not.  I see the black box sitting on my nightstand.  Was it just a bad dream?  Can I get up and follow my normal routine?
XZ4RcUHWaa	The cops.|`|mggll8dRaa	The Gatehouse, then 9-1-1.....!!|`|Fnp2MIycaa	Errrr...Ghostbusters?|`|3OoCiOkAaa	I think I would call the police as 'Ray Parker Junior'  is a bit old and all he does is sing 'Ghostbusters' . He would be no use in a bizzare situation. <br>  <br>  As for  the Ghostbusters  they are all very old, some of them are dead and one of them is out of shape. They would also be inept at staving off weird and sinister behaviour.<br>  <br>  <br>  When I say the 'Police'  I hope you realise I would be calling Sting and the rest of his eighties band, not the cops. Sting has remained in good shape, he's clever and he looks like he would be useful in  a fight.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit : recording the fight and putting it on youtube would make no money or solve the problem. I could sell an exclusive story about Sting to the tabloids after the event.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|xACwWEXHaa	DUST BUSTERS!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (I live in West Texas, and you never know what the wind will blow in.)|`|faddb3c58c57bc112ff5dec44a742ff8aa	Ghostbusters.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	ghostbusters!!<br>  [[=|`|DaokQBKhaa	Your mate with the camcorder so you can stick it on Youtube.|`|YpvJhJdsaa	GHOSTBUSTERS! lool :D|`|ry358ggfaa	**** the police

He was there with some of his friends, and they had ditched him. Well, my sis got tired of waiting for me, so she went off to look for her clothes. While we were talking, we kind of heard this scream. My sis comes running with this little pj shirt, I mean that this is see-through and it has feather and sparkles and it is pink. She runs up to me, holds it against me, and say to the guy, "Doesn't this match your girlfriend perfectly?" He looks at her and starts laughing. I'm beet red and muttering to her that she will get it when we get home. The little brat just shrugs and walks away.

lQIKWXDuaa	I really encourage you to get a degree in Radiation Therapy and to attend a university that offer this course. You can always go to the technical school first and earn the certificate then go to a four university. That way you can start earning money while you go to school but it really is up to you. The higher your degree the higher your salary. Certificate/diploma--> Associate degree--> Bachelors--> Master--> PhD.<br>  <br>  ss|`|XmLJ84YBaa	You will be paid based on your level of education in radiation therapy.

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	The most frustrating:<br>  <br>  *Students who get in trouble at school but whose behaviors don't improve because the parents aren't punishing them at home or even undermining the punishment at school (I knew a mom who gave her child Nintendo DS games because she felt bad that he was in detention for...get this...cussing out his mother, who is the librarian).<br>  *In a similar state, parents whose children cause problems and the parents put the blame on everyone but the child. I knew a child who made 3 children cry in less than an hour. I sent a note home and got a the following response: "I don't see how any of those actions constitute as physical violence....Maybe if you removed my son from his antagonists, it wouldn't happen." (This child was seeking them out)<br>  *Students who don't stand a chance at succeeding because their parents don't care about their attendance/grades/behavior/etc. <br>  *Parents who won't get out of the bar/work long enough to parent their own children but who expect teachers to "fix" their child's problems.<br>  *Students who will tell you exactly how they should be acting but then act exactly the opposite. They can say all the signs of bullies and then are out bullying.<br>  *Students who argue with me or always have to have the last word.<br>  *Students who feel that the second the teacher turns her back, they're allowed to get out of their seats and run around the room.|`|28pcgUw4aa	People being disruptive in class.

tkpBDLwYaa	I haven't read Death of a Salesman in quite some time, but I do remember Willy as being both a sad and pitiable (not pitiful) character, as well as proud, frustrated and angry.  Consider that paradox or complexity of Willy as his ability to interact as he does with the other characters in the play, as well as how it influences their interactions with him and each other.  He has worked hard all his life as a salesman, which is a hard job.  It is a typical male thing (no offense intended) for a man to feel what he does in his career is for the betterment of the people around him.  He's spend his whole life doing  something he hates in hopes of achieving some appreciation and success, yet both have slipped from his grasp.  This is what makes him sad and pitiable.  His reaction to this is what makes him as a character frustrated and angry.  He displaces his affections for his two sons, idolizing the good-for-nothing dope because at least he can make a few touchdowns, and despises the other for being intelligent and sensitive.<br>  <br>  As I said, its been a long time, but that is how I remember it.  How I remember it is because it struck a chord in me.  The best way to remember anything is to use some sort of mnemonic device.  In other words, associate it with something else you easily remember.  You can use little post-it notes stuck up in various locations in your home, such as on the mirror in the bathroom, on the refrigerator, on the cupboard door.  Write down the points you want to make, stick them to that surface, then associate them with that item.|`|EuSV9f6uaa	lol|`|bzt6WmBUaa	I'm really sorry i can't help you, i've never read the book, but i can give you a tip - read over your revision notes and talk about the book to a friend or relative, you'll find that it's easier to talk about the book and it's character's to your friends or teacher (as they've read the book). anyway good luck on your exam<br>  hope i've helped, best wishes Rachael x

All the more power to you for saving time and money.<br>  <br>  That being said, it will be a challenge getting into top graduate programs without having set foot in a university. Being bright isn't always enough. You need recommendations and research experience, neither of which you can get from CLEP exams. I won't say it's impossible; if you get incredible GRE scores and can write as if you've been through college, someone will probably give you a chance, but compared to the department head's friend's star student who just published his undergraduate thesis, they'd be taking a risk with you.<br>  <br>  Another thing--no one will care if you got into Harvard and Yale but didn't go. Being admitted is not the same thing as completing a degree there. If you have no intention of enrolling there, there is no point in wasting your money and time--and someone else's spot--applying there.

m2Z4wnE5aa	I am currently in Pharmacy school.  When I originally applied I gathered a list of the pharmacy schools in the US (there are over 50).<br>  A list can be found by searching the web. I used a PCAT study guide that had them all listed. <br>  Once I selected the ones I was interested I went online and looked at their pre-requisites. Although most are very similar pay attention to each schools’ requirements because there are variations (example: some schools require calc based physics others require algebra based physics, some require a full year of physics some require only one semester.) <br>  Once you decide on a few pharmacy schools and have looked at each schools requirements you can meet with an advisor where you plan on completing your pre-pharmacy.  They will help you set up a schedule or "Plan" on completing the classes needed to apply to the schools you are interested in. Applying to several schools is important because I found that the schools I talk to accept a range of 1 out of 4 to 1 out of 10 applicants.<br>  Besides school preparation consider other things for your resume. Experience helps.  Go in to your local pharmacy and mention your interest in the field.  See if they are hiring or if you could volunteer. I worked at a pharmacy while completing my pre-pharmacy.<br>  Finally, pharmacy schools are interested in individuals that would be positive in the community. After all pharmacists graduating these days are graduating with a doctorate.  Build your resume by donating time.  Tutoring and helping less fortunate shows your willingness to help and care about the less fortunate.<br>  Hope this helps, and good luck. Remember as good as the job pays you have to love the work to become a pharmacist. If I didn't love the subject I would have thrown the towel in already. The classes in pharmacy school are difficult.

a66nvk0taa	If you are advised that you meet the PVA requirements, you will be asked to undergo further processing. This includes payment of course tuition fee to the Australian educational institution and a medical examination. It is essential that the student and the accompanying dependent(s) meet the Australian Health requirements before a visa may be granted. This involves a medical check and an x-ray for applicants over 16. Applicants will need to present an original valid passport to identify themselves to the Doctor and Radiologist. In some cases medical results will be referred to Australia and as this process takes 3 4 weeks, applicants will need to allow additional time. Usually only medicals where the doctor or radiologist has detected an abnormality will be referred to Australia. Applicants need to take into account postage or courier times also. <br>  <br>  5.

The female equivalent, which is used less often, is "dudette." However, "dude" has evolved to become more unisex to encompass both genders[3], and this was true even in the 1950s, when the word was used in its more traditional sense.[4] It can alternatively be spelled "dood."[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The word dude is an American English slang term generally used informally to address or refer to somebody and was once used primarily by adults but this has become a common slang term used in various age groups.<br>  <br>  Dude!.....Sweet!....

They are not to be used in class, on the understanding that they will be confiscated for the duration of the lesson, or maybe the day for repeat offenders.<br>  2. They would be the sole responsibility of the owner, so if they were lost/stolen/destroyed the school could not be held accountable.<br>  <br>  Another thing would be if you got in a fight, or some sort of trouble, if you had your cellphone, you might call your parent to come in, which might not be appropriate.|`|d1a7edebc33c3995ba43b888a1d936abaa	I think since you have 30 or more mins. for lunch you should be allow to use your cellphones.

They're disruptive to other students who choose to work and learn.|`|LWvh2g2maa	No.  Kids just use them for texting, taking pictures, and chatting with friends when they should be paying attention to their studies.  If there is a family emergency then the office can be called.  I grew up in a time when no one had cell phones and I got by in school just fine.  In fact, I don't know what I even could've used a cell phone for in high school except texting my boyfriend that went to a different school.

AA10023710	Your major can be business, or any other subject that you desire, so long as you also take all the pre-requisite classes required by med schools. Those include:<br>  - 1 year biology w. lab<br>  - 1 year general chemistry w. lab<br>  - 1 year organic chemistry w. lab<br>  - 1 year physics w. lab<br>  - college level math at least through stats, and preferably through calculus<br>  - 1 year English<br>  - other science classes - which ones are your choice<br>  <br>  So long as your school offers all that, it'll work. It can't be "Bio for Poets". It needs to be a real, hardcore, Bio 101 class with a lab. <br>  <br>  You cannot get into med school without this coursework. You also won't do well on the MCAT, which is the entrance exam for med school, without it. <br>  <br>  You probably need to improve your grades. The average GPA of students admitted to med school last year was a 3.6. That doesn't mean that you won't get in if yours is lower, but it'd be better if it were higher. <br>  <br>  You need to do health-related volunteer work and physician shadowing. <br>  <br>  In addition, the college you're going to now must be regionally accredited. It can't be Devry or a similar career school. Babson is great, but not, like, "Chubb Business Institute". You also need to get a bachelors degree.|`|1oj4aamaaa	If you have no biology acumen, and you don't have straight A's, better stay in business school.|`|2PK51yGLaa	Not likely.  Medical school has some requirements--depends on if it is USA, UK, etc.  I'd check with the schools you are interested in attending, or, alternatively, check with the AMA.<br>  <br>  Medical school deans often say that some students have brought something to the school/class that most of the other students did not--for instance, a person not being a 'typical' biology student who had all the 'pre-med' "stuff."  So long as you are intelligent, have taken (and passed) the required courses, etc., I would think your "difference" might be an advantage...<br>  <br>  Variety is the spice of life.  Make yourself stand out.  Hospitals and private doctor offices do need business professionals, so I don't see your Business Degree being a downside so long as you have taken all of the requirements to get into a particular program.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

Not only does he now teach history, but he teachers (take a wild guess) East Asian Civilizations and Sociology/Psychology as well.  He also learned Japanese on his own, which permit him to move to Japan for a few years to become a Japanese teacher.  Mind, the man's a genuis.  But I'm sure that if you get a good combination of courses, you can really apply them to your history major.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Take education.

A2G9foewaa	people were greatly depressed|`|xLXVSrn6aa	The stock market crashed. Thousands of people became homeless do to companies closing down and the stock market crash. Many people in America became homeless in the blink of an eye.|`|AA11348786	The great depression created a lack of capital flow, and a pullback of confidence in the way that americans spent thier money. The new deal that was proposed by Franklin delano Roosevelt started the turn around that brought this country to a point of moving prosperity. It created national work projects that were mainly substructural in nature. This included state and federal roadways, water dam projects, bridges and the seeding of private industry to get the national economy moving the flow of capital down to the average american.With a large segment of the nation in abstract poverty, the midwest farmers losing thier farms, bread lines, and mills shutting down in the northeast, this influx of capital took about 5 years to free up the constraint that the depression brought to America. The war effort also helped to speed the volume of workers back to a sense of dignity through building the war materials for britain in thier war effort with Germany.|`|qAFz6LTyaa	The Great Depression had a substantial and varied impact on the lives of Americans. Physically and psychologically, it was devastating to many people, who not only lacked adequate food, shelter, and clothing but felt they were to blame for their desperate state.Although few people died from starvation, many did not have enough to eat. Some people searched garbage dumps for food or ate weeds.<br>  <br>  The psychological impact was equally damaging. During the prosperity of the 1920's, many Americans believed success went to those who deserved it. Given that attitude, the unemployment brought by the depression of the 1930's was a crushing blow. If the economic system really distribted rewards on the basis of merit, those who lost their jobs had to conclude that it was their own fault. Self-blame and self-doubt became epidemic.<br>     <br>  These attitudes declined after the New Deal began, however. The establishment of government programs to counteract the depression indicated to many of the unemployed that the crisis was a large social problem, not a matter of personal failing. Still, having to ask for assistance was humiliating for many men who had thought of themselves as self-sufficient and breadwinners for their families.<br>  <br>  Effects of the depression on children were often radically different from the impact on their parents.  During the depression many children took on greater responsibilities at an earlier age than later generations would. Some teenagers found jobs when their parents could not, reversing the normal roles of provider and dependent. Sometimes children had to comfort their despairing parents.<br>  <br>  The depression's impact was less dramatic, but ultimately more damaging, for minorities in America than for whites. By 1932 about 50 percent of he nation's black workers were unemployed. Blacks were frequently forced out of jobs in order to give them to unemployed whites.

If she really had him, then maybe she'll understand and have a chat with the VP or principal of your school.<br>  Either that or stick it out for the last 3 or 4 months of school.<br>  I saw an earlier comment about "say he touched you and he'll get fired"<br>  you shouldnt do that. 1) that's lying 2) you're young now. when you're older you'll understand what its like for someone to lose their job. you don't know if he's got a lot of money or not. If he gets fired he might have to live on the streets. He might get sent to jail. He won't be able to get another job because that "touching" goes on his record. and you'll live with a guilty conscience for the rest of your life. and if someone finds out you lied, then you're screwed and that goes on your permanent record. try getting into college or a job with that.<br>  If he yells at you, tell him you have a problem with his yelling. Say you aren't deaf and you can hear him perfectly fine, and that if he continues to yell at you, you'll be going to have a chat with the principal.<br>  If you're smart, you'll get a group of your classmates (the more, the better, whole class if possible) to go and complain about him.|`|xihWos2maa	I'm pretty sure that you can get a restraining order from the office.

In our schools hand book, we are not allowed to throw anything and the teachers aren't allowed to either. I realize that it is gym class, and it's a basketball, so you are supposed to throw it, but when you aim to hit some one, it becomes a projectile. It's like a fork.

I mean where all going to deel with people we hate and have no Control over what they do. its Just a fact of life that we have to face. the only thing you can do is try harder i that class to be better at the sports you play to get him to like you more (and trust me I know that's hard to do. I didn't become good at sports Intel I joined the track team in 8th Grade. and I still can't play anything with a ball unless other people want to get hurt lol)|`|SlkLCLoDaa	Talk to your parents about what is going on, since your mom had this same poo head as a teacher maybe she will understand.

XmLJ84YBaa	There really isn't anything you can do about the past grades. What's done is done. However, since you say you don't pay attention while you are reading why not pay a little more attention to what you are reading? Try reading in a quiet room and stay focused on the task at hand. If it is really making you this upset this should be enough motivation to try a little harder. If you simply cannot understand what you are reading or where the quiz questions are coming from you should talk with your teacher. Right now, from the numbers you've given you have a 77.5 average. Which is not bad; not even close to failing. However, the only thing you can do now is focus on all the reading assignments for the rest of the term, and do the best you can. Seek out a tutor or extra help if you need it.

6t5kQnSFaa	Those who believe they are doing right are the most dangerous because they truly 100% believe what they are doing is for the greater good.<br>  <br>  Example: <br>  <br>  If a person adopts a dog and they want to have the happiest dog ever so they go out and they buy all the toys, and treats, and food. They let the dog eat whenever he wants, they don't think they're doing the right thing if the dog cries so they don't leave him in a crate overnight. Instead this puppy has free roam of a house, it doesn't have any boundaries. Nothing.<br>  <br>  This person believes 100% they are doing the right thing, but the dog is suffering. Dogs need boundaries. Dogs have a different social structure than humans and therefore need to be treated differently. <br>  <br>  This isn't the greatest example, but I didn't want to get to graphic or offensive.<br>  <br>  **Let me try to clarify: <br>  <br>  If you met someone who truly believed that women actually enjoyed rape because they found it exciting, but didn't want to admit it. It'd be hard to convince them otherwise AND think of the women that he could harm -- all the while believing he's in the right.<br>  <br>  You couldn't try to convince them that the women really didn't enjoy because he would claim they were just being coy.<br>  <br>  Example 2: People who don't believe in abortion, but bomb or shoot up abortion clinics. They claim they are fighting for the lives of the babies, but they ignore the fact that they are killing others because they believe they are in the right. They believe they are doing what is necessary to save the babies lives.<br>  <br>  On the other hand. Someone who knows that what they are doing is bad has the ability to change.

Term papers are generally intended to describe an event or concept or argue a point. There is much overlap between the terms "research paper" and "term paper". The phrase "term paper" was originally used to describe a paper (usually a research based paper) that was due at the end of the "term" - either a semester or quarter, depending on which unit of measure a school used. However, the term has fallen out of favor. Common usage has "term paper" and "research paper" as interchangeable, but this is not completely accurate. Not all term papers involve academic research, and not all research papers are term papers.

Before computerized word-processing was widely available, writers would underline certain terms in handwritten or manually typed pages, and the underlining would be replaced by italics in the published version. Since word processing today allows many options for font faces and textual effects, it is generally recommended that you choose either underlining or italics and use it consistently throughout a given document as needed. Because academic papers are manuscripts and not final publications and because italics are not always easily recognized with some fonts, many instructors prefer underlining over italics for course papers. Whichever you choose, italics or underlining should be used . . .|`|SAoA5yw1aa	titles of books, albums, and periodicals are underlined or in italics.<br>  <br>  short stories, poems, essays, songs, are in italics.
