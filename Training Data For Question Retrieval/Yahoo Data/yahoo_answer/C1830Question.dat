I'm asking because I currently have Windows XP SP3(service package 3) and my brother and I are considering upgrading to Windows 7 but we're also looking into the MAC OS. I prefer Windows because I've grown accustomed to it but my brother likes MAC because he does a lot of things with web designing and photoshop etc and he says you get a lot more options on MAC then Windows.      I've also heard that there's a lot more freedom on Windows the MAC and I've heard this a lot. What do people mean by this?      What are the pros and cons of each operating system?      Which do you prefer and why?

20090219190343AAhe6XG	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Will this run on my computer?	I have always been a huge Sims fan. I had one of the original PC games that came out. Last June, for my birthday, I recieved a laptop and the Sims 2 Deluxe Edition Package. The laptop I got was and still is the same Windows Vista. I checked the back of the box the game was in, and it said it played on Windows Vista. The moment I got home, I got everything out and sat down and played. It was a brand new computer, and a brand new game, that requirements MET, and yet the game would play, but occasionally cut itself off right in the middle of my game, and after a while, I just got tired of always losing stuff because it wasn't saved when it cut off. Well, this year, the Sims 3 is coming out TWO DAYS before my birthday, and I am stoked, only I am very skeptical to whether or not it will actually work and I'm not going to go waste 50 more dollars on something that doesn't. Help?

20090220175020AAStabB	Computers & Internet;Software	Need an expert on Microsoft Outlook....?	When I open a new mail message, the default is that a space is added between each paragraph of the same style.     So I right mouse click, go down to "paragraph" and check the box that says "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style".  That appears to fix the problem, but when I send the message, the text automatically defaults back to adding a space between each paragraph.  So the recipient receives an email that looks ridiculous because of all the huge spaces between the paragraphs.     Why would this be happening???  It's driving me crazy!        Also, this default to adding the space between each paragraph occurs everytime I open up a new mail message.  So every message I go to send, I have to make sure I check the box that doesn't add the extra space.  But even though I thought that particular message was fixed, I have just discovered, that it isn't really, because Outlook changes it in the sending process.      Can someone please help me to change the default in my MS Outlook program?   My husband works in IT, (networking and developing programs specific to the company he works for) and he's had a look for me, but can't work it out.      Please help.  Thank you. :o)

Whats happening is the rectangular buttons that show which programs are open are now small and on the right side next to the clock,volume, and speaker buttons. They used to be longer. For example the one for internet explorer used to have the e logo with the words internet explorer. Now its just the e logo. Also all the 4 windows I have open aren't displayed on the taskbar. It has up and down arrows. It displays only two at a time I have to click the arrows to open different programs. Its annoying help me.

In Microsoft Word, can you set the auto-correct options to break up numbers with commas?      For a data analysis class I am in, I have to write short reports in Microsoft Word 2007 that contain six and seven digit numbers.  The style for the course requires that the numbers be broken up with commas by thousands (ex: 1,000,000 is correct while 1000000 is incorrect).      I am not used to typing commas while writing in Microsoft Word, so I am wondering if there is a way to make Microsoft Word automatically format numbers that way.

I installed the software that came with the chord and I also downloaded the TI Connect software that I found online.        When I proceeded to download a program that I thought would be helpful for me, it downloaded but the computer said that it didn't have the correct programs to access it. Can I even download programs onto a calculator as basic as the TI-83 or do I need a more recent version of calculator? Can I only download certain programs? Is there anything else that I need to download before I begin downloading programs? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks.

20090220233542AArkd8n	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	DVD links- how are they stored?	Hi all. I am somewhat puzzled at the moment when thinking of how the links we see on DVD menu's are actually stored on the media. I've noticed that the menu itself (links included) is stored as a reasonably small VOB file (a cousin of MPG, both based on the MPEG-2 definition, which claims to use lossy compression hence is not vector based).      What I cant gather is, how can the end device (game console, DVD player, computer, etc) differentiate between what pixels are links, and what pixels are just the video? Perhaps a range could be defined somewhere (either in the VOB if it were permitted, or in the INF file) by stating for each link, an x1, x2, y1 and y2. To enable keyboard selection, each link would probably need an index (from 0 to the number of links -1), and the end device could store the current index, which would refer to which link is currently highlighted. Then, the target media for that link needs to be stored. The end device can then perform a redirect to the selected URL. That is just the system that I would implement, but there is no documentation out there that i've read that confirms this is actually how DVD data is stored. If anyone out there has any info to help me out or can provide any doco, that would be greatly appreciated. Cheers

So: what software can I install under Administator, that will work to block porn and questionable sites under Guest?

I am a cloth wholeseller, primarily Sarees a 6-9 meters unstitched printed cloth (an ethnic Indian wear for Indian women).      My customers are retailer, resellers and showroom owners from cities across India. Customers look at models in sarees and then choose which saree print they would like to order in bulk.      Each day photographs needs to be get it done from photographers of models wearing each sarees print as the saree print changes each day. This is a substantial cost in terms of labour and time.      Is there any computer enabled system I can integrate or install by which I show the saree to a capturing device say a "video camera" connected to a computer and this saree print is captured by the computer (possibly in a software) and then a model wearing that saree print is shown on a wide display output screen such as a large LCD computer or Video Wall. This way I will need to only input the different print of a saree each day and the model/ Mannequin is shown wearing different saree print on the video wall.      Thanks for your comments.

First there's a button, you click it and square comes down asking you for your name and your email, so you type them, click the button, and they are sent to the email...      The action script for the 2nd time frame is       stop();   Go.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_D... mouseDownHandler2);   function mouseDownHandler2(event:MouseEvent):void {       gotoAndStop(238);   }         And I've read a loot of tutorials for doing this, but I don't really understand where to put the codes for the Action Script, and when I try to make anything a variable, it tells me that Action Script 3.0 doesn't support it.. And I read somewhere that you have to make the forms into variables and blah, Is there any tutorial but like "for dummies"? xD

20090220234822AAmlD96	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Need help and tips on torrenting?	I got tired of downloading song by song on limewire so i decided to use torrents. I downloaded BitTorrent and i use thepiratebay.org. I have a few questions.       1. What is vuze? Is it the same as bittorrent and utorrent etc.?       2. How come when i download an album that is 54 mb it took about 20 minutes but when i download an album that is 68mb it is taking a very very long time (over an hour)? Does it have to do anything with vuze becuase at first i downloaded half of the 54 mb album on vuze, then thought vuze was the same as bittorent uninstalled it, then re downloaded it on bittorent.       3. And am i torrenting things right? All i do is search something up on the pirate bay. Then i press on the link, press download, and select open with bit torrent. Is that all there is to it, or is there a middle step?       Any help is appreciated. Tips on torrenting would be appreciated too! Thanks!

In cell B2627 I have a persons name, C2627 contains how many cases the users order to fill is, and D2627 is how many cases the user has completed.  E2627 is d2627/c2627 formated to display percentage.        Now the important cells F2627 displays how many cases the user has grabbed according to the program used to monitor cases per hour.  G2627 contains the sum of all the users orders to find the accurate amount of cases said user has pulled.  Now what I need is a formula that will check cell b2627 see the name then look to cell g2627 and store that information.        Using this formula I want to calculate the users entire totals.  The problem is sometimes the orders go down 2 rows and other times it can go down 27 rows.        The key numbers only ever appear next to the users name the first time it appears.  Meaning cell b2628 would contain the same name but no values pertaining to the users case count.      Each persons name will appear more then once so I want to be able to easily check how many cases any user has just by autofilling the formula down an entire column.      If any of the above information is unclear please email me at rcgraybill@yahoo.com

20090203113929AAKK0v5	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Custom Build computer shuts off after seconds of hitting the power button..?	My custom built computer has worked well the whole year that i've had it, except loose wire issues.   One day I was playing a game when blocks of colors randomly appeared on my screen for a quick second, then the computer shut off.   Ever since then when I hit the power button the fans turn on for a quick second then shut back off.   There are still lights on the mother board so it shouldnt be a power problem..      Please help!

20090221022236AApHw43	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Speakers not working?	I've just had my computer repaired after the power supply unit broke down. Anyway, now I've got it back, everything is working fine except the speakers. There's only two plugs that come out of the speakers - a green one which plugs into the soundcard on the back of the computer, and a purple one that for the life of me I can't figure out where it goes. There aren't any sockets on the back of the machine that can accomodate this one, even if you unplugged something else. The green light doesn't come on the speakers, and it's not the soundcard that's broken since the monitors (crappier) speakers work fine when you plug them in. Computer is a Packard Bell, speakers are Diamond. Any suggestions?
