20090205191538AARQ6Iz	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	External hard drive, used as a main hard drive on a laptop.?	I have a Dell computer in which the internal hard drive fried on me twice and I don't want to buy another one as I need to have it shipped. So my question is that if I plug an external hard drive into the laptop, can I install windows and use that as my main drive? I believe I would be able to, because the USB and CD drives are operational even without a main hard drive in the computer. I would just boot from the USB port instead of the internal hard drive. Thanks lots.

I know it sounds weird lol- I'm an Info Analyst and 5 year programmer but I still get confused now and then between forward and back slashes. Just a few minutes ago at work I was debugging some error-filled code and it turned out the reason why I was getting a few erros is because I had typed a forward slash in a string "/" instead of a backslash "\".       The only effective way I can remember a backslash from a forward slash is that the backslashes make up all the escape characters, so when I need to type a backslash, I picture something like:      cout << "Hello World \n";      or echo "Hello World \r\n";      Does anyone know any other interesting || effective || (interesting & effective) ways to remember a forward slash from a backslash?

I have had internet here for many months, but now the lap top that was getting internet through the Linksys router quit receiving connection. Then the desktop didn't connect. So I disconnected the Router and ran the internet cable directly to the desktop computer. It works great. I don't know why the router quit transmitting, and when I have it plugged in correctly it shows that there is no internet connection going into it. So i ran the installation cd that came with the Linksys router again and it asks me to choose whether I have a cable (with modem) or DSL (with modem) connection. I don't have a modem with fiber internet so I am forced to choose one. Either one I choose it still says that there is no internet going into it. However I still have connection to my desktop PC.

20090205175427AAXGS8R	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Increase ram or memory to improve computer speed?	I'm looking to increase the speed of my PC and I've already deleted all unnecessary programs, ran defragmentor, and regularly clean out temp files and recycle bin so I was wondering what would increase the speed more, ram, more memory, or both?      I use my computer for mostly basic stuff like word, and going online but I do play games from time to time. I am not looking to upgrade solely for gaming because I already have a PS3 for next gen games. I also edit movies and that's where I have the most lag, especially with HD clips. In case it matters I use Magix Movie edit pro 11.      My current specs are:   503 ram   31.1 GB free space on about an 80GB hard drive      The other things I would like to know is what would you recommend for the best quality vs price in either ram or memory.

20090205184328AALoRCp	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why is my computer only showing partial RAM?	I had a 256mb. DDR2 stick of ram and added another of the exact same and when I open the System tab on control panel it only shows 480MB instead of 512. When I open System Information it shows that only 154.95MB. is available. Why is this and how can I make the rest of it useful??

20090205185904AAXzyeb	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	If I made a new account on a site after resetting my modem, can anyone tell who I am?	First of all, I'd just like to say I'm not asking this because I plan on trolling, flooding forums with spam, or doing anything malicious. I'm simply a very self-conscious and paranoid person. Often I'll make an account somewhere, and become self-conscious of something I've said, and make a new account.There are plenty of other instances, too.       Anyway, what I'm asking is if I, say make an account on a forum, then make a new one after resetting my modem, is there anything connecting me to my previous account (assuming I don't log into said account after resetting)?

I dont have that many programs(1 Game, FIrefox, iTunes, Bittorent, Limewire, Windows and Yahoo Messenger and the bar essentials.) I 've seen other computers move fast. Upon starting up, it takes a good 3 minutes for my computer to finish all the startup processes(the only programs I have set to open on startup are Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger). I really dont see why my computer is so brutally slow(takes around 3 minutes to open up my browser). There are constant freezes. Browser-based games are painfully slow. There are occasions why my music in iTunes freeze up, YouTube videos lag like hell. What the hell is with my computer?!?!?!?!?!

I have a Verizon modem model 6100f and i have Verizon high speed internet (dsl). Whenever i go on, the internet keeps on stopping at random times and restarts some minutes after. I would normally think its the connection, but the modem's internet light is still on, and if i purposely disconnect it the light will go off immediately. This happens normally and continously as long as I use the internet. When i open up the 192.168.1.1 thing, the modems screens show and I can still edit everything. Also, when i open that up, it sometimes starts the internet back up. I would like to know if there is anyway to help stop this because it is extremely annoying whenever I try to watch a video or download something. Thanks for any replies.

Please help My profile veiws wont show up on my homepage and when i go to Account Settings-Misscleaneouse it shows i have like 90 or something i have only had this myspace for like a month and i know where the profile veiws would show up because i had another one that shows them. it still says "Welcome to MySpace!

20090205195728AAzO56Q	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	I get a boot error saying that that I have a corrupt file and windows is unable to proceed?	I have gotten a few of these messages, one said it was the file ntkrnlpa.exe(which I know is the windows NT kernel) and another said it was a .sys file. Also, I cannot go into safe mode without the same message. I can press F8 and and disable enforce driver signatures and that allows my computer to continue booting, but more often than not, things go loopy like a program won't open or programs fail for no reason (my avast anti-virus is one). I don't think its a virus and other sources have said to do a repair install but I'm not convinced this will work. I'll do it as a last resort but if anyone has any other way, that would be appreciated, and I do not want to reformat. Thanks

20090203065811AAkeKJv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Ancient hard drive exploration?	I found an old conner hard drive in my closet, its IDE, and only has about 800mb of storage capacity. However, I know this drive was used somehow, a long long time ago. How could I go about recovering any data from the drive? its like a time capsule, and its waiting for me to open it. when i install the drive to the motherboard, the system installs the default drivers for it, but it wont come up in my computer with a drive letter. I know its working properly, as far as i can tell, because at the hardware screen of vista, all the correct information on the drive's label appears on the device properties. I was wondering if anyone knows a way to get the drive open and poke around for any files of any sort, old photos, maybe some text documents from the past. I know how to run a virtual machine in vmware, if that helps, but when i boot the drive as the master on my system, it says no operating system. it says its got a partition of MBT or MBR, i cant remember. I haven't dealt with hardware like this in a long long time, and Ive never recovered a hard drive before, so i was wondering if anyone out there knows how to. The drive has got to be around 1991-1995 year, old, but it appears to be in good condition, with a little dirt on the label.

20090203072053AAdqmQt	Computers & Internet;Internet;MySpace	Who else saw the ad on myspace yesterday about signing up for a lottery ticket for life?	I am a little FED UP with the ad that was presented on the MySpace homepage yesterday evening.  You click on it and it basically explains the end of the world happening in December 2012 and that if you sign up for the "life lottery" or something like that then you have a better chance of living....      I am fed up at the fact that myspace users vary in age.  I am 21 and still don't really know what to think about the idea that they say the world will end in 2012...I am also Christian and I am CONFUSED.  So for younger users to see that...really upsets me.        I am VERY surprised that myspace would even allow an ad that would test some people's faith and what not...especially about getting a lottery ticket to have a better chance at living.....      I am just very upset with the whole thing and am glad that it isn't on there today...      Did anyone else see it...and what did you think of it???

20090205205815AATeNoX	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer has power but will not start up?	I imagine that a similar situation to this has happened before, but I could not locate the thread.      At the moment, my HP Pavilion a530n desktop, running on XP SP2, will not even initiate startup.      I have disconnected all cables and reconnected the power cord. When I do this, a green light on the back of the power supply comes on indicating that power is being received to the unit. However, when I press the start button, nothing happens. The power supply starts up, fans are running, etc, but nothing is happening. I get no picture on my monitor, and it doesn't sound like the hard drive is spinning either.      Also, another thing is the start button, when started, lights up blue. The light is now very very dim, which to me clues that the power supply has just enough power to spin the fans, but not start up the hard drive? I don't know.      What is the problem here? Is it my power supply? Mother board? Hard drive? I'm not really sure. Early there was sort of a power surge, my outlet must have blown out, which is why I am in this problem to begin with. Anyways, when I look at the main connector from the power supply to the mother board, the light is lit up green, which to me indicates there is power to the mother board and works fine, but I can't be 100% sure.      Any help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you.

20090205213029AAC4pyf	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Does a computer using Vista really need/require preferably 2 GB of RAM to perform well, optimumly?	I bought a lap-top in December 2007 with Vista Home Basic installed in it, and the lap-top came with 1 GB of RAM and a 120 GB Hard Drive.      Although it has 1 GB of RAM, my lap-top runs ok, mind you I don't use it for intensive uses/purposes like graphics, playing games, video and audio. (I connect to other peoples web cams occasionally, and don't use, nor have a web cam myself)      I use my lap top for general internet and word processing/printing.    Even though Vista uses at least 512 MB from what I've read, when I inquired with computer businesses that sell RAM, I was told that despite Vista using/needing at least 512 MB of RAM that, computers using Vista, need at least 2 GB of RAM to start up and run.   Mine starts up and runs ok on 1GB.      The HP Health Check on my lap-top shows my lap tops status as fair. Out of Security, Hardware, Performance, Maintenence and Updates, only Performance needs improving by increasing and adding more memory (RAM).       Do I need to purchase and have more RAM installed, even though I don't use my computer for intensive uses as I mentioned above?      Also, yesterday I checked with the company, that deals with the extended warranty - I have the computer on, I was told, that if I change or replace any original parts or pieces of the computer with new ones, that I won't be covered. And most RAM sold, usually isn't approved by the manufacturer, et cetera (Hewlett Packard, etc) so what do or can I do?      If I did buy more RAM (relatively cheaper or cheap RAM like under $70 - $100 AUD) if something technical later went wrong with the lap top, do I take the newer un-approved sticks of RAM out and replace them with the original 2 x 512 MB sticks of RAM, so the company handling the extended warranty won't know the difference? How reliable is RAM you can buy from a computer shop or applicances and electrical retailer?   I was considering maybe buying some from where I purchased my lap top from - Clive Peeters.   2 GB for $65 or some figure/sum like that.      Additional RAM purchased, should come with some sort of guarantee/warranty shouldn't it?   But it something technically bad happens to the computer, it won't cover any effect to that, will it?   I can't afford to purchase expensive RAM over $70 - $75 - $100 something AUD.

I found my self up untill three in the morning knowing i had to be up early due to over active children. But as the night wore on i kept asking more question excited about what the answers would be. Most of the time i was hit with stupid unintellagent answers with no real content but sometimes i would get these amazing well thought out answers that blew me away. It fuled the fire even more. Does anyone else have this problem? How can i curve it so I will get a good nights rest?

20090205211644AApxdIl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What is better for gaming, HP Touchsmart or HP Firebird?	I currently have a MacBook, that I use for gaming. (Not the best idea) So I decided to save up for a new computer. I would either like the Touchsmart or the Firebird. I would be using this computer for gaming like World of Warcraft, FSX, and maybe GTA 4, of course, I'm new to gaming, sort of, but I know what I am doing. I would love the Touchsmart for the touch sensitive controls, but then when you look at the Firebird, it's all around gaming. A downside to the TouchSmart is that I can't use it for LAN parties, the thing is way too heavy. What should I get? I am willing to spend around 2000 dollars for a nice computer of gaming and entertainment.

The main sheet has 2 comboboxes. 1 is for state and the other is a customer list which gets updated based on the state selelction.      When I choose for example NSW, this activates the filter in the filtersheet to display NSW customers only, the problem is, when I populate the 2nd combobox with this value, it picks up everything!

Just got a Gateway dx4200-09 and I use Sound Forge to record and edit with and with the Old XP on my Old Computer I was able to switch back and forth between microphone and "what you hear" using the windows Mixer. That way I could record voice or some song or speech that I wanted to record from a web to play back later. This COmputer has a RealTek Audio Card on it and it sounds great! But you can't configure it to record streams from the web. It allows me to record voice using a Microphone - just not a "what You Hear" type stream. Any suggestions? It has to be some little configuration.   Thanks   Wayne

I'm looking for a website where I can post my predictions and ideas for our (technical and social) future. Does anyone know of such? It has to be fairly big and alive, because I'd like to have a chance of someone with money and/or importance reading those and paying me good money to work for her.      Example: Someday rather soon we (as in "non-technical users") will need to control and then have regulated with laws, how much of our computer's resources, such as network bandwidth, drive space, ram, and processor speed can be employed by a particular software program. We'll need software agents to notice unusal -- for this program or class of programs -- behaviour, such as "uses a lot too much ram for that version" or "recently started using a lot of bandwidth". It shouldn't rely on the user too much, but it also shouldn't stop her from doing something she wants to      PS. Why did I spend a few minutes wondering if I should use "her" instead of "him" when it's supposed to be gender neutral?

20060710141441AA2LJw9	Computers & Internet;Internet	The first mistake i made was giving out my credit card # to purchase a 7 day free trial with a co. i was inter	ested in.turns out i wasn't. i cancelled with them on the 5th day, but they did not confirm it till today. there was nothing in there terms of policy stating it would take 2 days to cancell. they popped me for 50.00 dollars, and cancelled. i feel they falesly advertised and misled me. They got 50.00 out of me and now i can't even use there product. when i tried to contact them to get a statement they just keep replying,"Thank you for reveiwing our free trial, your cancellation has been confirmed,and no further charges will be added to your card." I am so P.O.D. My question is, how can I go into my computer an retrieve the exact date and time I made my purchase. I do not mean to sound computer illiterate, but i have tried everything. I hope someone out there can help me.
