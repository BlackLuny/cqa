It doesn't have to be something over the top, but just say something that acknowledges her presence and demonstrates that you do, in fact, have a personality. I would also say something when you leave. For some reason, I like when my students tell me to have a good weekend (though it is usually after I tell them that). Just makes me think that they know I am alive and will also be away from school for 2 days. You could always ask if she had a nice weekend on Monday...I appreciate that as well. I would just try to be personable, even if you are that shy person.

lbR1IoiSaa	Well, this is what I know:<br>  <br>  VCU (VA commonwealth), is a dynamite school with a good reputation.  The students there tend to be more of your traditional population, and more of the "preppy" kind, but as with anywhere, there are a variety of 'types'.  <br>  <br>  Uof Richmond tends to be a slightly older group (30's), from what I know - a few years ago.   Again, very well respected.  <br>  <br>  Uof VA tends to be more of the 'younger' traditional college population. <br>  <br>  William and Mary, very well respected, quite a blend of age groups. <br>  <br>  GWU - some people would say is more 'prestigious' than the others, but what really matters is where you're going to feel more comfortable, what you can afford, and what you plan to do with your education, as to what you'll get out of it.<br>  <br>  JMU - don't know too much about it.  <br>  <br>  As for more specific information, i suggest you peruse each of their websites for more specific information.  Yes, it'll take you time, but research is what you'll be doing LOTS of in college, so why not get practicing :).  <br>  <br>  Each site should give you the 'average age' of their student body, and if you look for info on their housing, many will have pictures to give you an idea.  Also call the school and inquire on a tour, or ask if they have current students that serve as resource people for potential students!<br>  <br>  Oh yes, as for 'which college will give you a better chance. . . . " , remember, it's NOT the school who gives you a chance, it's a potential employer, based upon how educated you become, and how well you can present yourself on paper, and in person! <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Is there a point to compulsory education?<br>  <br>  From reading your poor grammar, one might deduce that:  a) you are a total imbecile or 2) this is some type of joke question.<br>  <br>    Your question has been featured on "failblog.com " as an example for total failure.  I am going to assume that you are just ignorant so I will answer in good faith.<br>     In Western society education is a way for children to learn knowledge and to be contributing to society.  Schools K-12 come into play here in that it teaches the student socialization and everyday skills. For example adding and subtraction is of important use on a daily basis. K-12 also teaches literacy which unfortunately many Americans are not able to read at higher than a 3 grade level.<br>     (There are notable illiterates that have come forward such as Fantasia Barino of American Idol fame.  This is a women who had a out of wed lock child at a very young age.  This adult women is currently learning how to read along-side her young daughter.)<br>      Which brings me back to schools. Schools also prevent pregnancy by providing sex education. In many studies around the world the number of pregnancies is dependent on the ability of the mother to read. This means if a women is able to read she tends not to have 15 children. <br>    Great schooling makes a huge difference to individuals. It decides your college, friends, partners, and career.  In US society a high school diploma is now a useless piece of paper. College degrees are becoming equivalent to what a h.s degree was previously. This only means that educations (read: schooling) is even more important! <br>     Your pay is very much dependent on your level of schooling. For example if you have a h.s diploma and like saying, "Do you want fries with that?" Great, because you will be saying that for the next 60 years.  The average medical doctor makes over 200K and that will increase over time. A minimum wage h.s diploma unfortunately will most likely be stuck at a service level job forever.

AP Chem and Physics are much harder and are also math based, which makes them quite difficult. Certain aspects of physics will even require that you use calculus, and AP chem is very formula and mathematics based.

If you are good at math, chem or physics are also very good choices.

Because my day is a battle, because no one seems to appreciate what I do, because I'm behind on my bills, because I buy things for my class with my own money, because I live off of generic brands, because I had to get my cable cut off... I feel like I don't get paid enough. I do feel like I am entitled to more, because I bust my behind to be a good teacher and barely make enough money to make ends meet...and then hear people tell me that I've got it easy because I don't work in the summer. Yeah, right!|`|Ds4xCthSaa	Well,.. here is the thing. It's just like parenting. There are alot of times your kid won't be grateful for everything, and true you might not always get along, but there are so many little moments where you really connect and feel like you are helping them in so many ways. That is what it is like teaching. You will most likely have at least one kid that might just drive you a little crazy, but it is so worth it when they are understanding what you are teaching and they are excited about learning. It's a great feeling, and plus you feel great yourself. Sort of like you are doing your part for the community. Which in all actuality you are one of the ones doing the most for the community. True the pay might not be great, but think of it as a service for the greater good.|`|LGBaK51Waa	I have been teaching for almost 7 years, which I know is not very long. I teach because I have a passion for it. I love the kids that I teach, and I want to anything that I can to make a difference in their life. I know that we as teachers have a big responsibility in what we do. We are educating our future leaders. I can't sit here and say oh I get paid more than enough. I don't rant and rave about what I make, but it would be nice to make more money. <br>  <br>  I am single and don't have any kids, so I don't have those types of responsibilities. I know that would have to be something to factor in, but knowing me and how I am...I would teach because I LOVE it.
CP3IiHG3aa	Those grades seem good. And at my high school we get to choose what classes we take. Like we have to take the core classes like english math science and history. but you can choose art, weightlifting, study hall, or business classes all depending on what you are wanting to get into. High school is really fun and it will be your best years yet. Get involved with clubs and or sports. I'm a senior already and I remember being scared. It goes by fast. Have fun!|`|7fIAqGpuaa	Im not too sure abotu the grades but im pretty sure they dont care what you got in elementry school because all elementry school does is prepare you for highschool. As for how it works, there are x number of periods per day (different school have different number). You have lunch like you do in elementry school but you dont have recess. you just get breaks (wich is basically used up walking to your next class). And you dont get to choose all of your classes. Some are mandatory and therefore must be taken, but there are a few classes that you do get to pick and they are called electives. You get a different number of electives to choose from each year and just like with periods, each school is different. I hope this helps

Another option is running start, where you take your classes at a community college and get high school and college credit. It's still school, but less physical presence required.<br>  <br>  California has a program where you can test out of high school. You might look into that.

That is GREAT experience because it gives you a taste of the whole teaching thing. However some learning centers may require an actual degree to work there, but don't quote me on that. Kumon is a great center and you can work as an instructor's assistant and for the most part it does not require a completed degree. There may be smaller companies out there where you can work as a tutor, just do some research. I highly reccomend learning centers. Also, that would look awesome on your resume after you get your degree :] good luck!

Q7lvSU03aa	I am sorry to read your story.  I know it can be frustrating to get low grades.  I am a teacher and have had students come to me in the exact way you described.  Ultimately it will depend on your teachers and their policies.  Here is the best advice I can give.<br>  1.  Find out why have low grades.  Are you missing work?  Did you bomb a test?  Is it something simple like you have something in your backpack and just forgot to turn it in?  Do you not understand the material covered?<br>  2.  Ask your teacher to help you.  I can guarantee they all want you to succeed.  Have them set up a plan with you on how to raise your grades.  It might mean doing some assignments over or getting someone to help you study.  No matter what it will take work.  F's don't just change by themselves, it takes work.<br>  3.  Ask for extra credit.  This will make up the difference if you can. <br>  <br>  Now all of this will not change anything before Tuesday.  Go to your parents on Tuesday and tell them your excuse about why you got these grades and then tell them that you have already talked to your teachers and explain how you will raise the grades.  Hopefully your parents will see you really want to raise your grades and not scream.<br>  <br>  Finally, at the midway point remember, nothing is final.  You still have half the quarter to go.  There is a lot of time left to change things.  But it begins with you working hard and really giving 100%.  High school is not easy and only gets harder.  Good luck, and let us know how it goes!|`|aqto0hJTaa	Teachers generally fall into two categories.  First, the people like me--we'll certainly let you make up your work and help you learn and improve and be glad you asked to do so.  Second, the "other kind"--those teachers get so hung up on due dates that they won't let you make up or redo anything.  If your teachers are like that, I think you're out of luck.  I hope they let you do it.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	If a student came to me with a story like that, I'd listen, but then I'd say that the student waited too late.  I would show the student a grade report and discuss the reason for the low grades (missing work--zeros bring a grade down very quickly, late assignments, work that was poorly done, need to study more, etc.).  I would help the student plan on how to bring up the grades by the end of the term--but it would be impossible to bring it up in one day.<br>  <br>  If you already know that you have work that you haven't turned in, do it now.  Bring that work with you on Monday.  (Some teachers wait to figure their grades out the day before they are due, but most teachers will already have averaged grades on Monday if the grades are due on Tuesday.  Those who wait to the last minute might be willing to grade the missing work before figuring out averages, but few will be.  It takes a lot of work to grade papers and figure out averages.)<br>  <br>  Mostly, chalk it up as a lesson learned.  Do your work every day.  Always turn in your work (a low grade is always better than a zero).  Don't focus on extra-credit, but rather focus on doing a decent job each day.  Ask questions if you need help.  Focus on fixing the grades by the end of the term and keeping them fixed.

If you find a martial arts school and explain the problem, they'll work with you to help you deal with bullies.  If you can't afford classes, try contacting the police and asking if they know of someone who'll help train you in self-defense--they may have officers who'll do it free of charge or will be able to help point you in the right direction.  Or try joining the wrestling team if your school has one.<br>  <br>  Learning self-defense will help give you confidence.  Bullies tend to shy away from confident people; they want to pick on easy targets.  But learning self-defense will also mean that you'll know how to defend yourself if necessary (from this bully and any others that you encounter in life).<br>  <br>  Also, don't be afraid to speak up and let those in authority know what's going on.  Most bullies get away with it because the officials don't know what's going on, and because their targets are too scared of the bullies to take it to the officials who can do something about it.  Make sure that they listen to you; be willing to bring it up more than once if necessary, until someone listens to you.  And if no one at school or home will deal with it, take it to the police.|`|2dPqad7Eaa	I usually insult him in a way he doesn't know it then when he figures it out he probably wants to fight I then say bring it on and he would probably back down|`|IXgPHYbDaa	get in there face. <br>  when they say somthing bad to  you. say something bad back.

In fact, sometimes when I was being drowned in emails (like...right before exams) it was just annoying because it was yet another email in my inbox. That could also be tough if my mailbox was almost full. Of course, it never hurts to be polite, and even if I was a little annoyed I did appreciate that my students cared enough to be polite. If you know this might be a really busy time for the professor -- e.g. if there's a test or a paper due soon -- just say something on the way out of your next class. That way you get to be polite but you don't add to the number of emails in the professor's inbox.|`|jbD6SRM9aa	I have always said thank you, and they haven't been annoyed by me. Also keep in mind that annoyance on their part might still make them have a higher point of view of you...you would seem polite. But at any rate, they're not annoyed.|`|AA11095087	Thanking someone is never bad.  But if you are worried about taking up space in their inbox, you might thank them for their help in person before or after the next class.
V5akMpDAaa	i would say that is wrong of them and that they should be more understanding.|`|tlDoq2a6aa	I'm in the same grade and I don't think you're being a baby at all. Maybe you should tell them what was going on while you were absent if you didn't already. They should've definitely cut you some slack and it's really disappointing that they didn't. On top of that, they should've realized that you're a good student and is usually responsible about homework. I'm sorry they weren't understanding and I'm sorry about your losses. I hope you feel better.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	I think you're taking it too seriously. High school is such a joke. If you were in college with bad grades then I'd be concerned.|`|7gPAfLrjaa	There is an easy solution to this.<br>  <br>  1. Have your mother or dad write you a note to take to the School office about all the deaths in your family. And have them also write that you just didn't have time to do your homework; because you were helping out getting things ready for the funerals.<br>  <br>  2. Tell your parents to put on this note; Please notify your teachers of the circumstances. So they can give you a few extra days to get caught up on your homework.|`|3lqjbusaaa	they should be more understanding that you're going through all of that. that is just terrible. you should have your parents talk to them or something. because having people die is a hard thing to go through. trust me i know because my dad died when i was eight, i saw my great grandma die, and my mom constantly talks about suicide.|`|AA10959177	Have your parents get with the principal 1st!

If the teachers are that out of touch...They should be sent to the principals office.<br>  Let them know the facts. And keep them abreast of your completed assignments. Especially if it is a lesson you may have missed you may want to get some extra help so they can assist.|`|pof2Oigsaa	the same thing happened to one of my friends.

FPpQk3bQaa	Those are for-profit diploma mills a degree from ECPI and ITT TECH isn't worth ****. Employers will not take you seriously with a ITT TECH "degree". Going to one of these schools will only leave you with major debt (over 20 grand!!!). <br>  <br>  UOP is a regionally accredited university, but they are currently under investigation for Financial Aid fraud. They will take anyone and most students will end up dropping out because the classes are too hard. Leaving them with thousands (up to 40,000) of dollars in debt. Debt that can never go away.<br>  <br>  Just stick with the community colleges and public funded vocational/occupational schools. At least those are free or really affordable and they aren't frowned upon.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to know more about ITT TECH or any other for-profit schools please go to <a href="http://ittakestime.org/" rel="nofollow">http://ittakestime.org/</a> .|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I got my Associates Degree at ECPI, and I agree that it is a bit of a rip-off. Some of the "teachers" were horrible. Several of them couldn't write a complete sentence. The books were very expensive, and the pace was grueling. ECPI did not offer a Bachelor's degree at that time. And only two of my previous classes from another state college counted toward my credits at ECPI. Finally, it was VERY expensive.|`|N8wNmQShaa	ECPI and ITT Tech aren't great schools to go to because they aren't regionally accredited.<br>  <br>  Regionally accredited means that that institutions credits transfer to just about every college.. (some credits wont transfer to some colleges, but neither will all of harvards)<br>  <br>  UOP is an actual degree, it is a real bachelors, unlike ITT TECH... with that being said, ITT TECH could be a good option if you going into that specific field... they do know their stuff when it comes to technology.<br>  <br>  Overall, go to UOP if you going to go for one of the three. It's classes do get tough over time, but nothing to hard. <br>  <br>  As far as not having credits to transfer to a University, that's ok... they will basically take anyone, they don't dummy down the work though... so that's how they do make a lot of money. Students dont understand a lot of it and have to drop out.|`|7SXzW8elaa	I am attending University of Phoenix-Online working towards an Associates degree. It's pretty good so far.

Only one comma after unconscious.|`|rlKZ40fZaa	Hi, your sentence is grammatically correct.<br>  <br>  However, the commas around the prepositional phrase 'by jumping out of a window' could be omitted, although it is personal preference. Technically, the phrase is non-essential to the sentence, but I think the commas could be omitted to improve fluency.<br>  <br>  Do not place a coma before 'so.' This is not coordinating conjunction; it is a subordinating conjunction with the 'that' omitted.<br>  <br>  Generally, when commas need to set off a phrase, the sentence can be restructured and improved.<br>  <br>  "By jumping out of the window, her second attempt at escape caused her to become unconcious so she was captured once again."<br>  <br>  Her second attempt at escape, jumping out of the window, caused her to ..."|`|MOPXWu33aa	During her second attempt to escape,by jumping out of a window,she<br>  became unconscious,and was captured once again.|`|0m8SofEjaa	You need a comma in b/w unconscious and so.<br>  Hope this helped.|`|S6bsdP1Vaa	I think it sounds good besides the "by jumping out of a window"<br>  <br>  I understand what you are trying to saybut my english teacher says if you surround something in commas it has to be its own sentence.

If you are happy with your score, study a little more to keep fresh for the test.<br>  <br>  If you're not happy, work through the practice tests, work with online study guides, and if that's not sufficient, get some private or group tutoring.

tCsFxh5Aaa	It depends on where you live.<br>  <br>  Most places will only allow a student to be in high school until age 21.  If you are going back to start high school at age 18, you'll be unlikely to make it to graduation *unless* you plan to work really hard and get all of the credits needed for graduation in 3 years or less.  (If you are keeping the baby, this will be practically impossible to do given the responsibilities of being a parent. If you are giving the baby up for adoption, you may be motivated and mature enough to do it.)<br>  <br>  To be sure of the age limit where you live, call up the local school district and ask them.  The guidance counselor should be able to supply you with all of the information that you need.  The guidance counselor should be able to give you a list of all the different options available to you.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	It all depends on your state.
AA11095087	When you graduate from the state school, no one will know that you began at a community college.  Your diploma, like those of the students who began there in the freshman year, will grant you the state school's four year degree.  No employer will be able to tell the difference unless he asks for your transcripts--and maybe not even then.<br>  <br>  If you are working hard and taking substantial classes (the same sort as freshmen at the state school), you should be at the same level as your peers.  Most community colleges provide a perfectly acceptable first two years of college. <br>  <br>  But you will have to study, go to class, and do the classwork to keep up.  But that is true for everyone.  Every college student learns the difference between pacing, expectations, and workload between high school and college.|`|DyUlb5beaa	You'll be seen as the same. People transfer all the time. It's a good transition from high school to college. You'll be getting the same degree as them, so it wouldn't matter if you started at community college or not. It's not rare to see someone successful starting off at a community college. In the hospital I volunteer at, several doctors and pharmacists started in community college. My brother started in De Anza community college and is now in Berkeley's law school.|`|jbD6SRM9aa	You won't be an underdog, and you won't be disadvantaged when it comes to employment. <br>  Make sure you keep your grades up and always stay active in extracurriculars.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|lrPOIWQwaa	So long as you get a degree. You'll need strong credentials no matter what if you want to get a job. But down to your question. The fact that you went to a community college will be overlooked by alot of job recruiters. It's not important that you went to a community college. <br>  <br>  When i hire people, i look into 3 things<br>  <br>  1. Did they get a college degree<br>  2. Do they display articulation and can they work well with others?<br>  3. And then finally, whether or not they show promise through what they did before<br>  <br>  What helps the best is if you get an internship somewhere or if you apply yourself through outside programs.<br>  <br>  Anyway, don't beat yourself up too much. It would be stupid of me to say you have an equal chance as someone else to get a job, because there are just too many variables that need to be taken into account. You can easily have a better chance than someone who went to a state school first.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, don't worry. So long as you get a degree, you'll be on the same footing as the ones who went to a state college first.|`|llD9dxjFaa	easy, just take it very seriously<br>  <br>  a biggie here is to make 100% sure all the credits you are taking will transfer to the SPECIFIC school you want to transfer to<br>  <br>  I am speaking from experience.

There are 94 coins in all, which means that the number of dimes with the number of quarters would add up to 94 coins total, so d + q = 94. A dime is worth $0.10, so the total amount of money from the dimes alone would be the number of dimes multiplied by how each one is worth, which is 0.1d. Likewise, a quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount of money from the quarters alone would be the number of quarters multiplied by how much each one is worth, which is 0.25q. The total amount of money is $19.30, which means that 0.1d + 0.25q = 19.3. Therefore, in summary, your two equations are:<br>  <br>  d + q = 94<br>  0.1d + 0.25q = 19.3<br>  <br>  Now solve by substitution. First solve for one of the variables in one of the equations. I'll solve for d in the first equation and then substitute what it equals for d in the second equation in order to solve for q:<br>  <br>  d + q = 94 (subtract q from both sides)<br>  d = 94 - q<br>  <br>  0.1d + 0.25q = 19.3 (substitute 94 - q for d)<br>  0.1(94 - q) + 0.25q = 19.3 (distribute 0.1)<br>  9.4 - 0.1q + 0.25q = 19.3 (combine like terms)<br>  9.4 + 0.15q = 19.3 (subtract 9.4 from both sides)<br>  0.15q = 9.9 (divide both sides by 0.15)<br>  q = 66<br>  <br>  d = 94 - q (substitute 66 for q)<br>  d = 94 - 66<br>  d = 28<br>  <br>  ANSWER: Veronica has 28 dimes and 66 quarters.|`|AVC6ehuNaa	76 quarters.<br>  3 dimes :))<br>  you can do it multiple ways<br>  like you could do more dimes and less quarters. but i rather have quarters : ))|`|4Lzf3wenaa	Simply make a system of equations with x as the number of quarters and y as the number of dimes:<br>  x + y = 94<br>  .25x + .1y = 19.30<br>  Solving for x and y gives respectively 66 and 28.  So you have 66 quarters and 28 dimes.|`|eOktXx17aa	let x = dimes and y = quarters<br>  94 = x + y<br>  1930 = 10x + 25y<br>  so x = 94-y<br>  substitute: 1930 = 10(94-y) + 25y<br>  so: 1930 = 940 - 10y + 25y<br>  1930 = 940 + 15y<br>  990 = 15y<br>  66 = y<br>  so substitute back into the other equation: 94 = x + 66<br>  solve for x: x = 28<br>  there are 28 dimes and 66 quarters

I'll have on at dinner maybe or if I'm not driving and everyone else is drinking and there's a lot of beer at the event... otherwise, I don't drink. He'll drink alcohol eventually, it's almost guaranteed. Once he gets to high school and he starts going to parties and hanging out with friends, someone is going to offer him alcohol.

But I will be REQUIRED to take Physics in MA. Therefore I have to take the class. But based on what you gave for information, I would recommend you to take ROTC. It is an elective and it will look good. But if you also want to enter college with a variety of science courses I would go with Physics. It depends on what you want to do. This year I had sacrificed my football team,which I have played on since I came into High school, to focus on my AP classes (English, History, & Chemistry). So I'm definitely cutting down on the AP and taking it little bit easier. <br>  <br>  So it depends on what you want to do; add electives to your college resume or go into college with a background knowledge in a variety of sciences.<br>  <br>  *GOOD LUCK ON THE AP CHEMISTRY EXAM

Another reason is drug addiction, some students tend to clinch into drugs due to some personal and family relations failure.  Some go into drugs due to peer pressure, when this happens they started to neglect their studies and beginning to be irresponsible students/people.

jN8duTx2aa	There are a couple of ways this can work.<br>  <br>  Most visual arts programs give you a Bachelors of Fine Arts (BFA).  So fine arts isn't the major, its the degree.  The emphasis would be equivalent to a major in painting.<br>  <br>  Another option is for the emphasis to be a concentration within your specific discipline.

Examples: A BA in History with an emphasis in Medieval History, a Masters of Public Policy with an emphasis in Health Policy, etc.|`|S9vnARx8aa	You pretty much nailed it. I'll use your example to explain - all art majors have certain classes that are required - like design 1 or intro to drawing. Then, depending on your emphasis, you take the remaining number of classes you need to graduate from you emphasis area. So if you majored in art with an emphasis in painting you would take all the required art courses, and all of you electives would be in painting.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Fine arts covers quite a lot of things such as sculpture, pottery, music etc.  You emphasis would be the area within fine arts you concentrate one eg painting.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill
MRGZCh0vaa	The best study tip that I can give you, that I use because I truly only study for a test 5 minutes before it, is to make flashcards. I know, it sounds dumb, but its sooo useful. On one side, put the event or vocabulary word, and on the other side put the major info on the event, or the definition on it. Read through them once, for example take one flashcard, lets say it says Stonewall Jackson, read that out loud and then read the back, lets say it says "died in battle of Chancellorsville." Once you are done with the set of flashcards, quiz yourself by trying to guess what the flashcard says. It works very well, and works better if you say it out loud.|`|GTwVNeHraa	get off the pc right now!!!<br>  I have the same prob. i had weekend work/ finish projects due 2 morrow & i barely started.|`|8CyT8tJWaa	Do what I do.<br>  Look over everything - notes, hw, through the book, a million times in a row, I do this all of the time and make good grades.|`|Fps1EtPFaa	do this:<br>  look over all your notes. every time you read a paragraph, turn the page over and write down all the most important stuff that you have just read. this basically summarises the info and leaves you with smaller notes. then read every note through as much as you can before tuesday. good luck!!|`|QmMbRnc0aa	try to pick things around the room that will help you remember the answer when you take the test - try to make it somehow relate to each other - maybe the answer is someone who has red hair so pick something that's red, etc.|`|jBSmqavlaa	skim read all of your notes or text book.

vyVDWIehaa	You're right about most classes being pointless and irrelevant.  There's 2 ways to approach that:<br>  <br>  1) Major in something you truly love.  Music, film, english.  Forget about how much $ you're going to make.  Pursue your passion.  If you love it, you won't forget it.<br>  <br>  2) Major in something practical and kick butt and get a really high GPA.  Go medical school or a top ranking grad school which will equal a high salary.  Now your looking at college as you looked at high school.  You're working hard to get good grades in something you don't care about for the sake of reaching a goal.<br>  <br>  If I had to do it all over again, I'd go for 1...|`|AXiKJDV9aa	That's because you are approaching learning the wrong way.  It is not about memorizing facts, it is about learning how to think using those facts.  That's why college is important - you learn how to think.  Hopefully you are also doing activities that require thinking such as assignments atc.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|olopisx7aa	I agree some things you'll never use again in your life. Like math. I hated math and didn't know why I needed to learn algebra unless I was going into a career which used algebra-which I wasn't.<br>  <br>  But college is important-to get a degree, get a better job, make more money, support yourself and your family better, learn a lot you didn't learn in high school, college is on a completely different level than high school, make a lot of new friends, learn to think in a different way, learn to look at things in a different perspective.<br>  <br>  I learned a lot in college I never would have learned in high school and it made me see the world and situations in a different light.|`|N2Xto1pFaa	Because without a college degree, you're going to be working crap jobs for the rest of your life, if you get a job at all in this crap economy (assuming you live in the US). <br>  <br>  College is alot like high school; you have to take a bunch of random, generic classes that teach you stuff you're never going to use again, but the classes that actually have to do with your major shouldn't be that boring. Well, boring maybe, but not pointless. Have you declared one yet? <br>  Like one of the people above me said, do something you love. I was just settling for something that I thought would work out well and get me a job, but it wasn't fulfilling at all. I've since changed majors and I feel alot better and I love college. Hopefully at some point it'll stop sucking for you.|`|SQe4ghfdaa	I wonder the same thing sometimes.

They are majority coaches who do not know much about the subject which they are teaching. <br>  Also, at some schools the teachers are tired of teaching, and start to not really care about the students within their classroom.<br>  Another thing is, each state has a state test that the students are mandated to pass, in order to pass onto the next grade and avoid remedial classes of the subject that they have failed on the test.<br>  I.E. If you have to take the Math test, and you fail it; next school year you will be taking the remedial class for it, or not even passing onto the next grade year.<br>  Along with the state tests, at least in Texas, if the majority of the students are failing, the school can be closed down by the state or they can fire the teachers of those subjects.<br>  <br>  Also, I am sure they will look at your SAT scores, but I am not sure how  much accountability they give it.

You are missing a lot of commas and  I have no idea what Anna Wintour was even in this piece.<br>  <br>  During my freshman year IN HIGH SCHOOL, I took a basic photography class. [TEXT DELETED] It was in this class that I REALIZED that I had the "eye'" for photography AND I DECIDED TO CONTINUE BY PHOTOGRAPHIC EDUCATION. [TEXT DELETED] My experiences in photography enabled me to become the president of photography club, photography Editor of the yearbook, and participate in AP Art. [TEXT DELETED] I ALSO volunteer for an organization called Save the Forge River, AN ORGANIZATION which works to CONSERVE our local [TEXT DELETED] river and the importance of its health. My pieces were [TEXT DELETED] published online and I HAVE  become the leading PHOTOGRAPHER OF THE ORGANIZATION.  Struggling to find the right major and school for my future, I decided to attend some non-credit courses in the city to see what photography major has to offer. My first class was at LIM [what is LIM, why would the school  care where you took the class?] and TAUGHT the fundamentals of magazine development where I was able to incorporate my own advertisements and photographs into the design. After SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING the course, [TEXT DELETED] advertising became an interest, which lead me to continue the program at FIT. This class that was given at FIT pushed me in the right direction as it enabled me to meet new people and work in a studio for the first time. It is now my senior year and in the past year alone I have worked in a studio setting numerous times and at each event I find how much I love photography and the lengths in which I will take to accomplish all of my aspirations.<br>  .

0aJlEmIxaa	The large, hollow organs of the digestive tract contain a layer of muscle that enables their walls to move. The movement of organ walls can propel food and liquid through the system and also can mix the contents within each organ. Food moves from one organ to the next through muscle action called peristalsis. Peristalsis looks like an ocean wave traveling through the muscle. The muscle of the organ contracts to create a narrowing and then propels the narrowed portion slowly down the length of the organ. These waves of narrowing push the food and fluid in front of them through each hollow organ.<br>  <br>  The first major muscle movement occurs when food or liquid is swallowed. Although you are able to start swallowing by choice, once the swallow begins, it becomes involuntary and proceeds under the control of the nerves.<br>  <br>  Swallowed food is pushed into the esophagus, which connects the throat above with the stomach below. At the junction of the esophagus and stomach, there is a ringlike muscle, called the lower esophageal sphincter, closing the passage between the two organs. As food approaches the closed sphincter, the sphincter relaxes and allows the food to pass through to the stomach.<br>  <br>  The stomach has three mechanical tasks. First, it stores the swallowed food and liquid. To do this, the muscle of the upper part of the stomach relaxes to accept large volumes of swallowed material. The second job is to mix up the food, liquid, and digestive juice produced by the stomach. The lower part of the stomach mixes these materials by its muscle action. The third task of the stomach is to empty its contents slowly into the small intestine.<br>  <br>  Several factors affect emptying of the stomach, including the kind of food and the degree of muscle action of the emptying stomach and the small intestine. Carbohydrates, for example, spend the least amount of time in the stomach, while protein stays in the stomach longer, and fats the longest. As the food dissolves into the juices from the pancreas, liver, and intestine, the contents of the intestine are mixed and pushed forward to allow further digestion.<br>  <br>  Finally, the digested nutrients are absorbed through the intestinal walls and transported throughout the body. The waste products of this process include undigested parts of the food, known as fiber, and older cells that have been shed from the mucosa. These materials are pushed into the colon, where they remain until the feces are expelled by a bowel movement.

However, it just might be too much. AP classes are hard, and if your band program is as intense as mine, i suggest losing 1 or 2 ap classes. The band can stay, unless it really puts you behind during school. Swim always looks good, go for varsity. And you definitely need clubs. Choose between band and swim if the pressure is too much.|`|Dwdbv9LLaa	You won't find time to sleep if you have that much to do.

SIhxrxD3aa	Once you've earned your DVM you can treat any animal you want. <br>  <br>  I don't really understand where the 2 years to get your conservation degree came from.  You can get a bachelor's degree in wildlife conservation while you are doing your pre-vet work.<br>  <br>  Also, you don't need to do those 2 years of interships.  I'm not really sure where you got that from either.  Vets are not required to do an internship and residency unless they are going to be board certified.  If you want to go into wildlife conservation, then it might be wise to go ahead and get board certified, but that will take you 5 years, not 2 (2 years of interships and 3 years residency).<br>  <br>  It is very hard to open your own rehab facility and I'm not really sure how you are going to be both a small animal vet and work in this rehab facility.  Both are full time jobs.  You will not have the money to open a rehab facility straight out of vet school because you will be in a lot of debt after you graduate.  You should instead get yourself board certified in exotic medicine and try to find a job at a place that is already in existance.  Or work as a small animal vet for a while, try to save up some money and then open a wildlife rehab practice.  I think you'll find it very difficult to get the startup costs for a rehab facility while you are owing $300,000 in student loans.

lIfeAsb3aa	4 periods a day would give students less classes, so less notes and less stuff to memorise. But on the down side to make school 6 hours long with only 4 perios, that woould make each class almost double in time. So all classes would be extra long and boring so students might not pay attention. But long classes = more information during a school week, so less school time and more summer time.
AXiKJDV9aa	In general no.  However Virginia Tech is well known for engineering so they have a lot of applicants - hence tougher competition.  Basically how hard a school is to get in depends on how popular it is. At a school less well known for engineering and more well known for humanities (ie the 3+2 engineering program at Reed) the converse would be true.  That's one reason I like 3+2 programs.  They are generally not as tough to get into as the programs at the better engineering schools - and they will help you get into an engineering school.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Usually, yes. But some people go into college without a specific major in mind and take up liberal arts...only later to find their niche and transfer into a major or stay in liberal arts and graduate with a degree in that.  Also, if your aiming for a particular degree in a particular major, then some schools do give "tryouts" for it, such as theater, arts, dancing, music, or even law (bar exam).  Engineering may be one of those...yeah... So maybe your friend is right. But don't let what he tells you discourage you from it....at least try. If engineering is your passion, then go for it at VA Tech.  Let the school tell you "No", not your friend.|`|1G9tkQunaa	If you really want General Engineering, please do not change your major.  The office will review your application first for General Engineering.  If you do not meet those requirements, they will automatically look at you for University Studies.

Believe me, I know how it works ;-)|`|kUlZCbhNaa	Fields such as Engineering, Medicine, Law and Denistry are traditionally hard to get into and require top marks where as if you passed high school with very average grades you shouldn't have any problems geting accepted into any humanities degree program.

If you are already going to fail classes anyway, there isn't too much that will be missed out on since you will likely have to make them up in the future. Most schools will be able to help you with your circumstances and you will be able to get through the whole situation. ex.... I was an 'A/B' student and suffered severe head trauma my sophomore yr wrestling, I couldnt read/understand/focus/or even sit for long periods of time, and it was a week before finals, i made special arrangements to take my finals and all my teachers understood, i ended up not even having to take one because i had an 87%  so she just gave me the B+.

iLFYj6Qgaa	Talk to her about it. Explain what you are thinking and feeling and why you are feeling that way. That's the only fair way to come to a good decision. <br>  If you don't include her in your decision making process, it will hurt much more if you decide to leave. If she feels that you don't ignore her, it will be easier for her to accept your final decision. She might even support you if you gently convince her that it's the best for you.|`|GcCdTgrxaa	It is always hard to tell a parent and especially mothers that sons need their fathers and prefers to be with them in their formative years.

cyemK54Iaa	Nope. It's not correct to say that in modern English either.<br>  <br>  In that sentence, with 'like' meaning love, you're just being redundant. Also, the word 'like' implies a crush or infatuation. On the other hand, 'love' implies to "real deal" so to speak.<br>  <br>  However, if you were to use 'like' as a comparison word, as in "I love like you do, wholeheartedly." or some such, that would be perfectly fine.|`|5eLfn45Iaa	You can like a thousand people but you can only love one.|`|AA11966816	No it`s gibberish in both Old and Modern English.
iiUwVSG3aa	Paleoanthropology is not a science that ends with the discovery of a bone. One has to have the original to work with. It is a life-long task. The science arguably began in the late 1800s when important discoveries occurred which led to the study of human evolution. The discovery of the Neanderthal in Germany, Thomas Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, and Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man were all important to early paleoanthropological research.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes, community colleges will take you, but don't wait until the last minute to register or the classes you want will be filled.  Most students stay at community college for two years - that's because you'd be applying to transfer in the fall, before you have any college grades to show for your effort - the school you're trying to transfer to only has your high school grades to go by, and if those won't get you into college, currently being in community college won't help - you need to take two years there so that when you apply to transfer you have a full year's worth of grades to show potential schools.|`|kFkV7Yroaa	The answer to your major concern is yes. You can get accepted by a community college because they don't require that much of you. And yes, you can transfer to another college or university once you complete your first two years in college but as long as you do well in college. <br>  <br>  I actually did that, and now i'm happy with the college im in. But i had to work hard on my grades during my first two years.|`|zIjZhlysaa	Yes, a community college will take you. If you want to do a transfer, make sure you get good grades in that first year that you take there. Also call the community college or ask an admissions consuler (they would be glad to help) about the particular rules in your state. In Virginia, for example, if you attend a community college for two years you can automatically get accepted into one of the good public universities. <br>  <br>  Since you are pursing art, it might be a little trickier. But take base art classes like Drawing I and still take subjects like English because those are still required for a Bachelors. Make sure you work towards making a good portfolio full of drawings from life!<br>  <br>  Even if you got a C average, you might just want to give it a shot for applying for university anyway, because art sections tend to look a little more into your portfolio than into your grades. And if they don't take you, no harm done, just do that year in community and transfer.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|6h5slqFnaa	Community colleges are easy to get into, from what I'm told.  It doesn't hurt to apply, or if you're still in high school, ask your guidance counselor what kind of grades you will need.  Most community colleges will have you get a 2-year associates degree and then you can transfer to another school.  Ask around at the community colleges you're interested in to see if they have partnerships with any universities - this ensures that most of your credits will transfer smoothly.  For example, I go to UMass Amherst, and North Shore Community College has a transfer program with my school.  It's a great way to save money on half your college years - I wish I had known about it!  And the last school you went to is always what employers put the most weight on.  Just make sure you get A's in community college.  Work very hard, get extra help from teachers, get a tutor even!  College is a wonderful opportunity, so make sure you don't repeat the same mistakes you did in high school that led to average performance.  Also, high grades and good performance on certain exams (SATs) will help you get scholarships.  Good luck!|`|7LukcKphaa	commuity colleges will accept anyone! lol<br>  <br>  Yes you can go with C's.<br>  To be honest, when I was in high school, I was a C student. Now Im in community college 2nd year, and Im on the Dean's list. Youll be surprised how well you do.<br>  <br>  You can transfer whenever you want. Try and get good marks though at Comm college.<br>  <br>  You cannot complete a Bachelors at a community college. You can start working on one, but can't graduate with one. You can get an Associates degree.|`|XLKrrkKvaa	Yes you can go to a community college and take courses and make a higher gpa then apply to a university and continue your education, your grades are good for getting into a community college.

nrmuEdGgaa	Yes, you can take it before you're junior year as practice and no, it will not show up on your record. <br>  Colleges don't see you PSAT score and it's not a big deal. The only reason why it's important is that you can be in the running for scholarships and have a chance to become a National Merit Finalist, which looks really good on your resume.|`|7lnyNHgYaa	Only schools you request to have your score sent to will be able to find your score. <br>  <br>  I took it my sophomore year and junior year. The only downside I saw is that as soon as you take it, you get TONS of college junk mail. (collegeboard.com runs the SAT and PSAT, and I think they sell addresses to colleges.)<br>  <br>  Go ahead, take it early. Practice makes perfect|`|11a734d02a61c7fd63fff863ecaae116aa	I suggest either 9th or 10th grade, better if you take it both years. that's what most of my school did.|`|EfwF4N0raa	The 10th PSAT will not be used for National Merit or college admittance consideration, but the 11th grade's will.  So it's free practice and you should take it, even if it does show up on your records, because it means nothing.

EvRIwz4Laa	bad bad bad idea. If it sounds like something you did not write all your professor has to do is type it in to Google and it will bring the online version right up. Beyond that with all of the different programs available to your professors the odds are not in your favor. If you get caught I promise that the penalty will be far worse than what it is worth. Just seriously do not do it. And if you do please please cite it. I promise if you copy word for word and cite it you will fare much better.|`|E70A7aqcaa	It depends on just how you, exactly, define "okay".   Copy-and-Pasting sounds like the 21'st century's version of what we called plagiarism, which, back in my day was illegal, not to say very dishonorable.  And it's yet another way of lying, which I never saw as an honorable "talent".  And as for being relevant to education, it's always been seen as the very antithesis to education.  So, whether you put it in your bibliography, which only piles lie on top of lie, is irrelevant to the bigger issues at hand.  But, it all depends on how YOU define "okay".  My older sister always did it, and she's proven to be one of the biggest wastes of humanity ever known.  She busted out of college after 6 weeks for partying too much.  I actually fell for that "dishonorable" stuff, and made sure I NEVER did it.  Now, three university degrees and a very successful career, with an early retirement because of it, I'm still happy I chose the direction I did.  But, it's YOUR definition of "okay" that counts here, and the consequences will be yours too, in the long run if not the short run.  God Bless you.|`|XLKrrkKvaa	If you copy and paste and you don't put it in your bibliography you are plagiarizing. Even if you put the information in your own words you are paraphrasing and plagiarizing, Teachers can use programs to find plagiarizing and if your paper is checked you can get a failing grade and be dismissed from school. Plagiarizing is a serious academic offense. It is like stealing,|`|oYYcFMDcaa	Paraphrase or quote it, and cite it. This small act will save you getting in big trouble.

AA12042427	oh boy. you sound just like me when i was a freshman.<br>  school IS boring but you gotta suck it up if you want to go to a good college. You have the potential, why waste it?<br>   <br>  Sleep, talk to a counselor about your problems (very important! it might be a health problem). and focus. While doing hw (always do it) turn of all electronics, and drink lots of water. <br>  <br>  Give some benefits to yourself. If I do good and raise my grades to Bs, I give myself some chocolate! or something like that.<br>  <br>  I can promise you that if you don't work harder by next year, you will not get into the great colleges. Most colleges ask for a 3.5+ GPA. If you really don't want to try, there's always community college, and the option of transferring. Of course, it's only your freshman year. According to some, colleges don't look at freshman year, but don't let that stop you from trying hard. Your habbits cannot become you. <br>  <br>  It's very important to talk to your counselor, very very important. If there is no problems, work harder! I don't know how I can make it fun for you when I myself hate school. Take some classes you enjoy (i enjoyed web design and manged to get myself a pretty good grade). Those that you loathe, simply try your hardest and take comfort in the fact that it's just temporary. 4 years go by fast. Grasp the reigns before it's too late.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	Maybe you are still getting the hang of things. Give it another semester to see how you do.

Believe it or not, from what I heard, colleges don't count freshman year. Of course, freshman year DOES go towards your GPA (or I think it does).<br>  <br>  If you were an A student, you are definitely not working towards your true potential. Are you overly stressed? Not sleeping?<br>  <br>  Here's what I have to tell you. I'm a sophmore currently, and my freshman year was pretty horrible and I'm pretty sure that screwed up my whole transcript. I do believe I have a 3.0 GPA when I typically have a 3.5+. Well, after a pretty long speech from my spanish teacher on how I could do better than I was doing, I decided to work hard.<br>  <br>  I did all my hw, I paid attention in class/took notes, and didn't sleep. Oh boy, I fell asleep a lot during the first semester. But as soon as I opened my ears, and paid more attention, my grades have skyrocketed. I unnderstand that my GPA is too far messed up right now for me to be in the top percentage of my class, but I know that if i work hard enough, I just might be top 100 (out of 500- my school's pretty big). Currently, in my individual classes, I'm pretty much 2nd or 3rd in the class. The matter is, I'm simply not very smart. <br>  <br>  I'm a B average student, you're an A. Work harder, sleep more (8 hrs every day!), and pay attention and you can pull it through. I understand how hard it is. High school is different from middle school. I think you're GPA rite now is around a 2.0? Well, work harder. that's what I can tell you. Get some tutoring if your really don't get your material. Start the year off right! Right Now, the only grades I see a problem with is english and math. Those two classes you need to pass in order to graduate. GET MOVING. get help, ask your teacher for suggestions on how to concentrate!<br>  <br>  Well, you still have a chance. But as much as I can see, ivy schools are out. They pretty much demand a what? 4.7 gpa? UC schools want a 3.5+. Keepy your As and you can do it! Raise those low grades to Bs! I believe in you. Trust me, if I can raise my C- to a B- in 2 weeks in CHEM (my worst class), so can you.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Just do the school work. Great college is subjective. The better you do the more options you will have and most importantly the easier it will be to do well in college.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	To get into a GREAT college, you will probably need a 4.0 gpa unweighted GPA, like 4.4-4.7 weighted to get in.

Just keep doing your best and maintain your grades.

So i think your mom is full of bull-poo.  I am a senior in college at the age of 32, i will be 33 when i graduate (this is going to be my second career).  I have been told by some people who work in the field that i will be joining that my age will be a PLUS.  Because i have adult maturity and knowledge to go along with the degree...that i am not just some kid who managed to get through college who will decide to do something different in a few years.

ciHjZsnLaa	"If you were to create your own myth, what problem from your life would you want to write about? What image would you use to portray this problem and its characteristics?<br>  <br>  The assignment, of course must be related to Camus. So when you have chosen your topic, you must try to relate it to the essay with appropriates examples.<br>  <br>  An introduction could then be something like that, in relation to your course, also, of course.<br>  <br>  All philosopher belong to a particular school, here it’s about the philosophy of the  absurd he idea of the absurd, a common theme in many existentialist works as expressed in Camus essay: The myth of Sisyphus, where he expresses the notion of contrast between the human need and the silence of the outer world. <br>  Camus, as Sartre thinks that the world will be forever hostile or indifferent towards humanity.<br>  What can humanity expect from an indifferent universe? So their conclusion is that people create Gods, legends, or stories that help humanity to face the harsh reality, to transcend it.<br>  <br>  Then the body of your essay<br>   <br>  As in the essay the gods condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, you are in your own life confronted to do ceaseless activity in order to live a meaningless life.<br>  According to this philosophy, and the assignment, to be a vegetarian is to have the pretension to have some inner knowledge and the will to spread the truth around you. But in doing this, aren’t you doing some offenses to those indifferent forces that don’t give any account for your work! Indeed, you have the pretension to follow another track than the average of people. You even miss to considerate the propriety of meat, which could be considered as a fault.<br>  So you’ll be punished to see everyone around you eating meat, and you’ll be given the right to eat as much vegetable as you want, but anytime you want to drink water, water will be transformed in alcohol, so that you’ll have to go to the river in order to drink. But as soon as you reach it, it will it will subside, and you’ll have to follow it, until you reach the mountain, then the source at the summit of the mountain, and there tired and thirsty, you’ll stare the stares in the sky that have witnessed your useless survival effort.<br>  <br>  But you can also had another part in your essay, and contradict Camus proposition. It’s what I would do, and I will demonstrate that those so called realistic point of view are only limitative point of view. You could show how nature and God are generous. How many riches come from the sky, for example, all that we eat is stare dust.<br>  <br>  Then you’ll have to do a synthesis where you compare both point of view, and end by a conclusion, where you take the principal idea, and eventually propose a new way of thinking, more balanced that would constitute a new myth, your own myth.

8cd4f3e61c71d068915185d505a002daaa	Junior year is most important, get the best grades you can, score well on the SAT, do some community service, work on your essays, and hopefully you'll get into the college you want.<br>  <br>  The earlier you figure out what passions you have, the better.  A strong factor in whether or not you'll enjoy college is your personal drive.  You want to be a "___" and that's why you're going to work hard in college.<br>  <br>  The other factors that contribute to college success, as your parents have talked to you about, are:<br>  <br>  1) Being social.  You'll feel much more involved and happy to have friends and people you enjoy seeing everyday.  It's a new experience being away from home and you'll want to share it with new friends.  Another plus side is that if anything 'terrible' happens, which inevitably will happen every so often, you'll have people to console with other than your parents (over the phone).<br>  <br>  2) You can try and get a roomie from your high-school to come with you to college, that way you'll be more comfortable.  If that isn't an option, it might comfort you to know that in most cases, people will try their best to get along.  You'll either love your roomie, get used to your roomie, or decide to hang at a friend's place most of the time.  In any case, don't be afraid to tell your roomie what's on your mind, or what they do that annoys you,  chances are they had no clue.<br>  <br>  3) It depends on how hard you challenge yourself in high school, but generally college is not as cut-throat as everyone makes it seem.  Though I will have to agree, telling high school students that it is really, really tough actually benefits them as they try to work harder to prepare for college.  In reality, I'm not sure if you've taken any Honors or AP classes (that account for your C/Ds or B/C+s) but college is about that level.  Whether or not you succeed is purely based on your study habit:<br>  <br>  4)  You're away from your parents.  You're free to party with friends or stay up all night or procrastinate to your hearts content.  You're not told to study or do homework.  You're your own responsibility.  A lot of people get carried away, and at the fast pace of college, a test will sneak up on you and before you know it you fail.  On the otherhand, if you study almost everyday, for even 2 ish hours, and actually show up to class everyday ( ditching is commonplace in college ) and do all your homework ( which isn't any different than high school homework ) and get help when you don't understand something ( there's ALWAYS someone willing to help a motivated student ) then you will succeed.  No doubt.<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember:  It's a general consensus that College is one of the best, and most privileged, experiences anyone will ever have, work hard in high school and show your parents you are indeed mature enough to go to college ( and won't use their money in vain) .|`|D6RekU7Iaa	If you don't like college, you can drop out like your dad did.<br>  <br>  Seriously, there's no harm in trying, but if you don't go to college just because your parents discouraged you, your life will suck.<br>  <br>  Just keep going and plan for college. There's everything to gain by trying and preparing. <br>  <br>  Even if roommate ends up being a jerk....XD <br>  <br>  And congrats on your improved school years.
db6qW1u5aa	I don't think so. I used GMAT prep books from Powerscore and Manhattan GMAT and scored a 730. In total they cost me maybe $200. The GMAT is just math and english, and you probably know those subjects pretty well already. Try studying on your own first and see if that works. If not, then maybe a class is worth a try. Either way, you could save some big $$ if you can self study.|`|Hj6xumI9aa	It can be. It depends on where you are re: your score, and where you want or can get to.<br>  <br>  You should start by looking at some online resources; for example,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.testsandtutors.com/course/view.php/GMAT" rel="nofollow">http://www.testsandtutors.com/course/vie...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.beatthegmat.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beatthegmat.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mba.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mba.com/</a><br>  <br>  and the others you can find online; also buy one of the many good books and work some of those sample questions. <br>  <br>  You should then take a sample test and see how you do. At that point, if you are not scoring well enough, it is probably worth getting a tutor or taking a group course. Remember, you will be spending $100k+ on the MBA in tuition. $1-3k to make sure you get into a good school can be a wise investment.

It takes some thinking, but you should be able to turn everything around to look good for you. For example, use phrases like "interpersonal skills" to make your experience universal... it's important to be able to work in a team and get along with people. <br>  <br>  Do you have any college team projects? You can include those on your resume also. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!

zg7myZiBaa	Hey.. <br>  I moved from Barrie (45 minutes outside of Toronto) to Vancouver Island right before grade 12. The only problems I had was some of the graduation requirements are a little. But here are some you may face if you move there: <br>  There's the OLC. (Ontario Literacy test) . You need a passing score (%50, I believe) In order to graduate. It's normally taken in grade 10.. But people who fail it take it over. This would be my biggest worry. Since the majority of people fail it the first time. You can't just take it whenever you want.. they only do them once a year.. in march, if I believe. So I would recommend taking the after school OLC seminars that your school will provide, since you can't afford to fail it.<br>  Also, Ontario requires you to have 30 hours of documented community service. This isn't really a problem for you. You can easily do that this summer or throughout the year. The education system is a little harder in ontario compared to BC. So, I hope you aren't behind in very many credits. <br>  PS: My bestfriend goes to U of T. Great school. Toronto has awesome schools. Just make sure you read up on them, because York U has been on strike and there was talk that U of T was going to follow. And you don't get your money back. <br>  Hope I helped.

ZNe6B9TQaa	I believe that 'beauty' is a rather subjective term that we use at our own discretion to categorize people with traits that we each individually find attractive.  For me, beautiful is often some one who is a brilliant conversationalist, both intellectually stimulating and a humorous joy to talk to.  It can also be applied to appearances; for me, someone with an emotional expression and exotic look might lead me to say beautiful more than over a stereotypical 'hot' person.  <br>  <br>  But most importantly, realize it's a blanket term to describe a range of attractive physical and personality features that each individual recognizes in another person.

aeP8GDWmaa	The length of PQ is the hypotenuse of a triangle, the base of which is 5 the height of which is 12, so the length is square root of 5^2 + 12^2 or square root of 169 or 13.  This is identical to the RS side so its length is also 13.  The length of QR ( and also SP) is the square root of 8 ^2 + 15 ^2 or square root of 289 or 17.  Total length is 2 times 13 plus 2 times 17 or 26 + 34 or 60.  The figure is a rectangle.|`|kgMp0d5jaa	With a problem such as this one, it would be helpful to diagram the figure on graph paper. Using the Pythagorean Theorum (a^2+b^2=c^2), we can find that PQ=13, QR=3route41, RS=13, and SP=3route41. All of this information leads us to the conclusion that PQRS is a rectangle.

If you were to have a double major I would suggest that you talk to a counselor right away so that you are on track from the very first moment that you step on a college campus. Having a double major is a lot of work but if you are on top of everything from the beginning you avoid a lot of stress later on when you are trying to finish up everything before graduation.|`|zIjZhlysaa	Try going to a large, general university that has both of the subjects that you are interested in.

N2Xto1pFaa	They look at your GPA from all 4 years, and they care more about your unweighted, because there's no such thing as a weighted in college.<br>  <br>  I'm going to be straight with you, both schools are good schools, but they're not easy to get into, especially UF. My older brother had the same issue in high school, he screwed around his freshman and sophomore year, but he got his act together and did well his junior and senior years. He just barely snuck in University of Florida's back door, (figuratively speaking), and that was 8 years ago. I go to UF now and I had a 3.7 unweighted, 4.2 weighted in high school, and I did extra-curricular stuff. Colleges like that alot; if you do stuff outside of just classes.<br>  <br>  They do look at every year though. But give it a shot. The worst they're going to do is tell you no.|`|nt7yYFuOaa	Honestly, yeah they do. They look at every year, just not as closely. When they see a 3.2, they certainly won't be impressed. I suggest getting it up soon.|`|7GAiTpVSaa	hey i wanna go there too!<br>  dont feel bad i failed algebra the 1st marking period, got a D- the 2nd and currently have an F now because i suck at it so much, its my only B level class, the rest are all Honors and A and im acing them all. what sucks is the math grade is bringing down my whole average.<br>  (im a freshman)|`|g2wswnelaa	they might glance at it. What they will look the most at is your overall unweighted gpa upon application. They look at your course level AP, IB, etc, and how many years you have taken of your core classes (english, math, science, history). Just remember grades are very important but not the only thing! best of luck|`|TNXQbg4Saa	they do look at freshman year.
lbR1IoiSaa	If you successfully pass all courses required to earn a Bachelors of Science in Nursing, you ALWAYS have that BSN.  <br>  <br>  If you fail the NCLEX, you can re-take it several times, within their guidelines (so many months apart etc). <br>  <br>  However, if you are worried about your ability to pass the NCLEX, I strongly suggest you take an NCLEX prep course.  I also, if your schedule will allow, would get a part-time internship at a local hospital towards your last semester.  This will give you real-world experience in applying the information you're learning (your clinicals will be ok, but just not as good as real-world experience).  <br>  <br>  Also, don't worry so much.  Just study, purchase an NCLEX review book at your local bookstore, develop a study plan, and you'll be fine! <br>  <br>  Confidence is half the battle!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EvRIwz4Laa	In order to take the NCLEX you have to have to obtain an authorization to test, which is only given to you by a certian organization that must receive notification of your successful completion of your college course work. (Although not 100%) if you do not do well in your courses you will not pass the NCLEX, and if you do well you will not have too much of a problem with the test. Once you obtain your ATT you must pay 200 dollars to take the NCLEX. If you do not pass you can take it again but you have to wait 91 days and Pay again. If you do not pass it after 3 times and.or within one year of obtaining your ATT you will have to go to an additional educational program approved of by the board before you will be able to take it again. If you do not ever pass you will just have a BS in nursing and you can work as a nursing assistant or something like that. If you are concerned you can always get books, take prep classes, and talk to you teachers who can give you some guidance.

AXiKJDV9aa	Schools like that are a crap shoot;<br>  <a href="http://susankayton.com/college.htm" rel="nofollow">http://susankayton.com/college.htm</a><br>  Twenty years ago, it was pretty easy to predict which students would be admitted, since the highly-selective colleges admitted about 1/3 of the applicants. All the bright, interesting kids were admitted back then.  However, nowadays, colleges no longer have room for all the bright, interesting kids since about five times as many kids apply for the same number of slots, so luck plays a huge factor.  If you play tuba and the school's marching band's only tuba player is graduating in June, you might get admitted!  Or they might be looking for a baritone for the men's a capella group.  Or perhaps they need someone from Wyoming so they can boast they have a student from each of the 50 states.  Or you juggle and the admissions officer who's reading your application also is a juggler, so he gives you the thumbs-up.  If you get in, you aren't "better" than the kids who don't get in - you're just luckier.<br>  <br>  The way to get into those types of scools is to apply to a few.  Hopefully you will get into at least one.  With those types of grades I would allso look at Cal-tech nad Harvey Mudd.<br>  <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caltech.edu/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmc.edu/</a><br>  <br>  Given the choice I would go to Harvey Mudd.  It sends a lot of students to graduate school - even more than name schools like Stanford.  Thats where the action is these days - not undergrad.<br>  <br>  Another excellent choice on that basis is the New College Florida:<br>  <a href="http://www.ncf.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncf.edu/</a><br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill
AXiKJDV9aa	False.  The best colleges are now a lot harder to get into than 20 years ago.

With all those corporations going out of business, jobs are disappearing....severely increasing competition for those that are left.  Add in the proposed tripling of H1B visas by the Obama administration and it is getting ridiculous how much wages are being depressed.<br>  <br>  I suppose you could consider that affirmative action....seeing as how Obama had next to nothing that qualified him to be president....yet he was elected anyhow.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	That's a load of crap.  Affirmative action might get people who aren't ready for college into college, but it won't get them a degree - you don't get extra points on your math homework for being black.  It gets people in, but then it's up to them to earn a degree.  If they aren't capable of doing so, they drop out - just like everyone else who wasn't ready for college.|`|9Ijv5Mppaa	Affirmative action is not what has "diluted" the bachelor's degree in America. <br>  <br>  I hate to burst your bubble of white privilege, but your perception of affirmative action and how it works is absurdly wrong. Affirmative action was established because of vast economic class differences between the races. A unqualified minority will not get into Harvard over a qualified WASP. BUT among equally qualified people of differing races, the one of the less privileged race would be admitted over the other. <br>  <br>  The "dilution" of the bachelor's degree in this country is due to concerted government efforts since after WWII to make secondary education accessible for all citizens of the country. That means the institution of Pell grants and other government funding for higher education, the GI Bill which allowed veterans to get college degrees after fighting for their country, and the building of colleges and universities at a higher rate than previously. Affirmative action didn't become en vogue until the 1990s, and by now most colleges use race-blind admissions. Some have moved to a more accurate form of affirmative action, based not on race but socioeconomic class. <br>  <br>  So maybe next time you formulate an opinion on something you should have a vague idea of what you are talking about; otherwise, maybe you should keep your inane and insulting thoughts to yourself.

6tPJK2uXaa	I'm currently in a psychology Ph.D. program and statistics is definitely one of the areas I find the most challenging.<br>  Something I have found most helpful is doing practice problems/homework and applying the concepts. If homework is assigned, make sure you are doing the assignments on-time. Also, if your course assigns readings, make sure you do them - it might seem unnecessary (and people with a really good head for math can probably skip most of the readings), but it will help you understand the statistics more. If there are not homework assignments, use a textbook or assigned reading to find practice problems for yourself. <br>  Another thing you can do is look for examples of the statistics you are learning in journal articles, to see how the different statistics are applied in different situations and how they are interpreted.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Math was my favorite subject.  To do well you simply need to study the material ans do the assignments like any orther subject.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill

If you are under a given age you can't "drop out" so you will be considered "truant" after a given number of missed days.<br>  <br>  The same applies if you didn't do the paperwork.<br>  <br>  It's the law, not just a "school policy".<br>  <br>  And I agree on the "you'll regret it" comment -- I worked in a factory and talked to some people who had dropped out and could only get minimum wage jobs.  They found out that working is not a lot different from going to school -- there's always someone telling you what to do and how to do it and getting after you if you don't do it right.<br>  <br>  And getting paid min. wage doesn't make it any better.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	Did you file paperwork when you dropped out or did you just stop going?

I also think a tutor would be helpful, again talk to your teacher, he should be able to recommend a former student.  I would also advise you to look into some books that can help you, go to your local bookstore and see what fits you best.  Most bookstores will have a section of AP Chem help books, you might find something there, but I would also look into Chemistry for Dummies or Chemistry Demystifyied.  You could also try looking at your local university library or even public library, ask a librarian to help you find a basic chemistry book.

It said something along the lines of "You would probably do well on the real test".  When I took the real test, I did in fact pass.  However, I know there are age-appropriate tests.  Being 13, you may be able to take a different version.  I would contact your local Mensa representative for more information.|`|rCRyhPiKaa	No, that's about average for a 13 year old (5-10='stay in bed', IQ 70, maybe, and average is deposed to be 18-20 for most 16 year olds. This means that a score or 13 is probably about Iq 80 for a 16, which would make it 80x16/13 which is about 98 for a 13 year old.) but those online tests are very unreliable, even the Mensa ones, especial because they distinguish between different kinds of intelligence (You good get all of the questions right in one area, but do badly in the others and so get a low mark overall, where as with a professional IQ your scores would looked at individually and the highest one would count as your over all).<br>  <br>  Hum... I should really stop writing so much in brackets and going of on tangents...<br>  <br>  Any ways, if you really want to know your IQ then have it tested one on one with a professional.

Admission statistics can also be misleading.  Cal-tech for example has a 17% admission rate compared to MIT's 5%, yet they are ranked about the same.  This would seem to indicate Cal-tech is easier to ge into - but its not.  The answer is that Cal-tech is not as well known as MIT, so MIT attracts more students with basically no chance, while Cal-tech only attracts those really into math/science/engineering.  They are equally as hard to get into.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|zIjZhlysaa	That's the general rule. But, well, it all depends on the school, really. The more people who apply for a school, the more competition to  get it. It also depends on the size of the school, if the school can accommodate more students, then it'll have a higher acceptance rate than a school that is on the same level but has a smaller student population.

smFfcmYuaa	The style you use to get an A in a course or the style you use that helps you remember the most from a course even years later. It depends on what your priorities are. <br>  <br>  In general academics are about memorization but people have different opinions on what is most conducive to that. Assuming you are in a class which has a useful textbook I found that reading the material in silence sometime before the class, going to class, and reading the material again while working on homework guaranteed an A for me in any objective class. I typically study straight for half an hour or so and then take a little break. Allegedly this is about as much as people can remember at a time so if you cram for hours straight without a break you can't remember it but I don't know about that.<br>  <br>  If studying the material once isn't enough for you then study it multiple times until you have memorized it and can apply it. In general it's only important to memorize key concepts and the rest that you remember should be close enough. <br>  <br>  But the thing that will help you out the most with studying is sleeping and eating properly. You can also try a little caffeine before tests to amp your brain up a bit but you're better off sleeping 8 hours than staying up 4 more hours studying.<br>  <br>  Failing anything else ask your teacher or a tutor to review your study habits. Failing that post here again with what you do specifically and get random people's opinions on it. If you have trouble only with specific things sticking in spite of possessing good study habits then it's possible you have a developmental disorder and there might be other things for you to try if that can be properly isolated. Good luck.

camWZEwqaa	Well for the most part you are required to get a bachelor's degree in Education (Liberal Studies) and get your teaching credential depending what state you live in. That will take 4-6 years (it depends on the college, there are programs where you finish in 4 years maybe a little less). That is a long time but don't be discouraged! Teaching is a great career path! And during the time you are taking classes get a job as a tutor or at a learning center to gain experience. When you are seeking a job after you get your degree, they do look for experienced people. GOOD LUCK!

Do not log in to Yahoo answers coz personally, it's pretty addicting. Also, stay away from distractions and anything that will gove you an EXCUSE to not study.<br>  <br>  2nd, think of the good benefits of studying: you'll end up improving yourself and you'll go to a good college...get a degree...make lotsa money :)<br>  <br>  3rd, think of the people in poor countries full of kids who couldnt afford to go to school and appreciate how lucky you are coz you are actually able to go. I saw this one kid in TV who had to travel 2 miles barefoot everyday because her school is too far and her family couldn't afford to buy her shoes yet she studied like crazy because she wants to be able to get a nice job so she dont have to be poor anymore.|`|HCWkdk4naa	i eat cookies when i have to study hard.  i'm not sure if it's the carbs that give me more energy, or the happy feeling i get when i eat cookies, but it definitely helps me work harder.|`|mfkGI2Xlaa	i have the exact same problem so i study with someone who is a fun person to study with  cuz then the jokes we make help me remember stuff<br>  <br>  good luck with ur test!|`|R5eyRm4xaa	music
Pg9IpSBjaa	You have to pay tuition for the school.  You have to pay to move anything you're going to take with you.  If you don't get on campus housing you have to pay for housing, food, etc - all that normal stuff.<br>  <br>  University tuition is generally much more expensive in the States than Canada.  My four year degree in Canada cost me $20,000; my two year Masters program at a university in Boston cost $50,000.  Of course it will depend on which school you go to but expect to pay a lot.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Depends on the school.  You may be able to get a scholarship.

d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	In each case, these are in the grouping of descriptive statistics and are using probability around the bell shaped curve.  So, the best place to start in figuring these out is to draw the curve!<br>  <br>  So: <br>  3. The diameter of a shaft has μ = 75mm with a standard deviation of ? = 8mm. Determine the proportion of the population of bushings that has a diameter of less than 65 mm.<br>  <br>  u stands for the mean or center of the population – this should be the center of the curve.<br>  The standard deviation is 8 so start drawing in +/- standard deviation dashed lines for plus/minus 1 standard deviation (75+/- 8 = 83 & 68), 2 standard deviations (75+/- 16 = 91 & 59) and 3 standard deviations (75+/- 24 = 99 & 51).  You can now use the probabilities of 68%, 95% & 99% (use the exact numbers from your book) to calculate the percentage of values within each area of the curve.<br>  <br>  Now, since this question asks for the population below a value of 65, you can look at your graph and get a very good approximation – 65 is just below the –1 standard deviation so you know that you can subtract the 68% (the plus/minus 1 standard deviation) and half of the other two values from your answer.  So you will have something just below 17% of your population below a value of 65 mm.<br>  <br>  Use this picture and the definitions in the book to calculate the exact value for the number of parts that will be found for this and the other questions that you pose.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you still have trouble with the understanding of the concept, pick up a descriptive statistics book and look under probabilities.
q6w8wnX2aa	its higher than average|`|zSG7NuzGaa	An IQ (intelligence quotient) compares your intelligence to those of others your age.  So, a 5 - year old could have an IQ of 146... The average IQ is 100, so your score is pretty good! However, if it was an online test, I would suggest asking your school to administer an actual IQ test.  IQ tests online are NOT always, if ever, accurate. :)

SuatuMWDaa	The introduction of the factory system had a profound effect on social relationships and living conditions. In earlier times the feudal lord and the guildmaster both had been expected to take some responsibility for the welfare of the serfs, apprentices, and journeymen who worked under them (see Feudalism; Guild). By contrast, the factory owners were considered to have discharged their obligations to employees with the payment of wages; thus, most owners took an impersonal attitude toward those who worked in their factories. This was in part because no particular strength or skill was required to operate many of the new factory machines. The owners of the early factories often were more interested in hiring a worker cheaply than in any other qualification. Thus they employed many women and children, who could be hired for lower wages than men. These low-paid employees had to work for as long as 16 hours a day; they were subjected to pressure, and even physical punishment, in an effort to make them speed up production. Since neither the machines nor the methods of work were designed for safety, many fatal and maiming accidents resulted. In 1802 the exploitation of pauper children led to the first factory legislation in England. That law, which limited a child's workday to 12 hours, and other legislation that followed were not strictly enforced.

fzzohCiYaa	You should try putting an "out of order" sign on your computer so that you won't be tempted to go on it, and give yourself a time limit in which to get your room organised, or even just your textbooks so that they are easy to find. When you get bored with your study, do a different subject, so that way it is all mixed up and you stay interested in what you're doing. Also, write down what you want to achieve by studying, your goals for school, and stick it up on your wall or somewhere where you can easily see it to keep you motivated. =]|`|E3P5jfGdaa	Studying don't ask me =)|`|HCWkdk4naa	only you can help yourself, don't blame your friends for not helping you study, it's not like you're helping them with school either!<br>  <br>    it might be helpful to keep in mind the consequences of failing all your subjects....like having to work at wendy's for the rest of your life..|`|THvfGib9aa	study with your friends.
N4nYw5B8aa	It stands for "politically correct". It's the huge thing nowadays to speak politically correctly. For instance, we don't call black people African-Americans anymore, we call them black. Basically, being politically correct means that you are being conscious of a certain group's sensitivities and speaking respectfully when referencing them.|`|bbb51eeb731786c5f1db8432f39fb0a2aa	Politically correct.  It was used very very briefly circa 1990 by progressives looking for less objectionable ways of describing people, but quickly fell apart under the arrogance of its name (if you disagree, you're not correct) and absurdity of some of its phrases (people with disabilities were "other abled").<br>  <br>  Since then, the phrase has only been used by people accusing others of over-sensitive language.  Though often the accuser uses it as a way demanding the right to use hateful language.<br>  <br>  And by comedians, of course.  They had a lot of fun with it for a few years, most of the absurd PC phrases you've heard were actually comedy.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	personal computer|`|d4d8e8a6a0b9de0b42ac50282fbc3c9caa	It stands for politically correct,  it is sometimes associated with institutionalized racism because people tend to hide behind this to be uncover racism instead of openly racism like people were in the past. so  for example instead of addressing a someone as "black" someone being political correct would be call them "african american"|`|w0HgVh6iaa	personal computer|`|BxoW8SEjaa	Purple catfish|`|R43uud6Taa	PERSONAL COMPUTER

Some of these Jews were fed okay, some of these poorest Africans were subsistence farmers who can grow their own food. Some are not so lucky and died of starvation.

E' inutile studiare 15 ore distratti: è meglio studiare 8 ore sode e poi far quello che ti va.  <br>  <br>  E poi trovati un luogo confortevole per studiare, solitario e silenzioso e senza distrazioni. E fatti un giro tra quei ragazzi che non hanno studiato e si fanno 8 ore in fabbrica o in cantiere. Vedrai che stimolo..<br>  <br>  Ma devi buttare fuori dalla mente  quello che non c'entra niente.

b90cafc102b273cef505ed8ce2c58099aa	Elektrizit?t (von griechisch ?λεκτρον (elektron) ?Bernstein“) ist der Oberbegriff für alle Ph?nomene, die ihre Ursache entweder in ruhender elektrischer Ladung oder bewegter Ladung (Str?me) sowie deren elektrischen und magnetischen Feldern haben. Die Tr?ger der elektrischen Ladung sind negativ geladene Elektronen und positiv geladene Protonen und Ionen. Gleichnamige Ladungen sto?en sich ab, ungleichnamige Ladungen ziehen einander an. Die Kraft, die auf Ladungen gleichen Vorzeichens wirkt, wird als Absto?ung bezeichnet, die Kraft auf Ladungen mit entgegengesetzten Vorzeichen als Anziehung. Wegen der Wechselwirkungskr?fte kommt der Elektrizit?t auch eine Bedeutung als Energietr?ger zu. Elektrische Ladungen sind die Quellen des elektrischen Feldes, bewegte Ladungen die Ursache für magnetische Felder. Elektromagnetische Wellen (wie z. B. Licht) sind Erregungen des elektromagnetischen Feldes und k?nnen sich nach Entstehung unabh?ngig von Ladungstr?gern im Raum (als Photonen) ausbreiten, d. h. fortbewegen, sie wechselwirken aber auch mit Materie.<br>  <br>  Bewegung elektrischer Ladung findet in elektrischen Leitern durch Bewegung freier Elektronen und in Flüssigkeiten durch Ionenbewegung statt. Bei den Festk?rpern unterscheidet man zwischen Leitern, Nichtleitern und Halbleitern.|`|8b50c0af58f950fdb4edb0ecf4bdeb84aa	Man sieht ihn nicht,man h?rt ihn nicht aber man spürt IHN!!!|`|b1f833fbeb8f8dde93981f06e0dc7ab0aa	Wenn man von Strom im klassischem Stil spricht, dann meint man damit Elektronen, die frei sind und sich deshalb bewegen k?nnen.

vA7Iq6FSaa	The biggest problem that the higher drinking age brings is on college campuses, where we can get alcohol extremely easily, but when somebody gets in serious trouble, people are to afraid to call the paramedics or a school official, because they don't want to get in trouble.  If the drinking age was lower, we would be a lot more willing to call for help.  <br>  <br>  The next problem is that of enforcing the issue.  People are getting DUI's for being .02% and perfectly capable of driving. In several cases, people can get jail time, and the government loses money on somebody who was perfectly capable driver, versus the person at .06% who kills a person because they didn't know their limits.  <br>  <br>  Also yes, we want to rebel against the law, but we will always find something else to do if we can't drink, like killing people.|`|VOhkD7HOaa	teens in cali drink alot but because it is illegal, they do it secretly and often go wild. If it was legal, teens wouldn't think of it as being so "bad" and they would be more responsible and could openly drink with adults or under supervision at bars, clubs, etc..|`|2TL2EarUaa	Rebeling against the law is the biggest one so deffinately focus on that and also that if the drinking age was lowered, teens would not have to drink and drive to hide their actions.  They could stay somewhere knowing that drinking is legal and it promotes more resposible drinking habits like designated drivers because you dont have to worry about missing out on one party.|`|O1A9gXrraa	Do you think lowering the drinking age is a good idea?<br>  <br>  In fact the drinking age at one time was 18.

The chances of winning one of those mega-prizes are one in several million, but they play anyways.<br>  <br>  So, what's the chance of an asteroid striking the earth on any given weekend.  Probably the same as hitting the lottery.  So, why do students wait till Sunday night to do their homework?  Simple.  What if an asteroid hit the earth Sunday afternoon and wiped-out all life on the planet?  Isn't it smarter to go out skateboarding Saturday afternoons and then go hang-out with some friends at the mall on Saturday night, rather than do the homework and take the chance that civilization may not exist by Monday morning when it's time to go to school?
8jtnB7riaa	You must use 2007 tax information on the 0809 FAFSA.<br>  <br>  You must use 2008 tax information on the 0910 FAFSA.<br>  <br>  End of story.<br>  <br>  Now, that said, you can write a letter for a professional judgment on your 0809 FAFSA based on the fact that you have a significantly lower income and what your circumstances are today.  This does not guarantee that you would be awarded any aid, but, you have to play by the rules.<br>  <br>  If you were to be selected for verification using phony numbers on the 0809 FAFSA your aid would be withdrawn if you cannot provide correct documentation.  Further, you would be banned from class and most likely stiffed with a bill for the quarter/semester. <br>  <br>  Talk to a financial aid officer at your school.  They should be able to guide you through this process.|`|8jl1tMiPaa	Okay...<br>  <br>  If you are going to be enrolled in the 2009 Fall semester, you will need to fill out the 2009-2010 FAFSA.

You should apply for scholarships- go to  www.fastweb.com for a good list. Good luck, and enjoy.

ZB9zkbxxaa	According to tradition (the Inca left no written records), the founder of the Incan dynasty led the tribe to Cuzco, which became their capital. Under the fourth emperor, they began to expand, and under the eighth they began a program of permanent conquest by establishing garrisons among the conquered peoples. Under Topa Inca Yupanqui and his successor, the empire reached its southernmost and northernmost extent. By the early 16th century the Inca controlled an empire of some 12 million subjects. They constructed a vast network of roads, their architecture was highly developed, and the remains of their irrigation systems, palaces, temples, and fortifications are still in evidence throughout the Andes. Incan society was highly stratified and featured an aristocratic bureaucracy. Their pantheon, worshiped in a highly organized state religion, included a sun god, a creator god, and a rain god. The Incan empire was overthrown in 1532 by the Spanish conquistadores, who made great use of the Incan road system during their conquests.

AVqV2Q9waa	this is how it should read<br>  <br>  For my totem pole the animals that I chose were, a deer, an owl, a salmon, a dove and a hummingbird. These five animals have similar characteristics to me. For instance, deer in native belief represents compassion, peace, caring, adventures, gentleness and many more. These characteristics represent who I am because when someone is in need I try my best to help them. Secondly, I chose the owl because it represents insight, clairvoyance, wisdom and messenger. For instance, I try to be insightful ( if you don't know how you are insightful pick a different word that has to do with the owl and write something that you really can relate to) Thirdly, the salmon because it symbolizes proudness, confidence, wisdom and inspiration. This reminds me of myself because everything I do, I do with confindence and many things inspire me to help reach goals in my life. also, I picked the dove which means love, gentleness and peace to all. I always try to love and have gentleness towards others and thats what makes me similar to the dove. Finally, I chose the hummingbird. This small bird represents timlessness, healing and a warrior spirit. I am like the hummingbird because I fight for the things I believe and I too have a warrior like spirit. <br>  <br>  Try not to use the same words so often mix it up to make it more inventive and detailed. And make a conclusion like (in conclusion these animals remind me of who I truly am and when I see the totem pole I will be proud of the animals I have chosen or something like that teachers always like that. lol)
eca735eb563a6a25bedeef0050127389aa	For my personal totem pole, the animals I chose were a deer, an owl, a salmon, a dove, and a hummingbird. These five animals and I share similar characteristics. For instance, the deer, in Native American belief, represents compassion, peace, caring, adventure, gentleness and much more. These characteristics resemble my personality because I care about others and when they are in need I try my best to help them. Secondly, I chose the owl because it represents insight, clairvoyance, and messages. For instance, I try to be insightful by studying a situation before I act so I fully understand it. Thirdly, I chose salmon because it symbolizes pride, confidence, wisdom and inspiration and because every thing I do, I do with confidence. I have inspiration to help me reach my goals in life. Furthermore, I chose the dove, which symbolizes love, gentleness, cross-world communication and peace. I chose dove because I try to love and show gentleness towards others. Finally, I chose the hummingbird, which represents timelessness, healing, a warrior's heart and is a messenger because I fight for what I want and I try my best to achieve it.|`|FcKxoOPGaa	Itz great!

hfDohxp5aa	If you mean why should people who choose teaching as a profession have life long learning, it is extremely important to keep up with all the new research and ways of teaching and learning styles etc.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	Developing life long learners is, as far as I'm concerned, the point of education. Teachers need to be life long learners so that they can stay on top of the latest theories of teaching, not say "that's the way I've always done it and it is good enough". They also need to stay on top of their field. They should also be excited about their learning and that of their students.<br>  Teachers want to create life long learners because it is the ultimate gift that you can give a student. The pace of change in the world is growing exponentially and you need to be able to learn to keep up. If students know how to learn - they can learn what they want or need to know when and as they need to learn it.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	Lifelong learning is "lifelong, lifewide, voluntary, and self-motivated"  learning to learn (learning how to recognize learning strategies, and monitor and evaluate learning) is a pre-condition for lifelong learning. Metacognition is an essential first step in developing lifelong learning.  Literally ‘thinking about the process of knowing,’ metacognition refers to “higher order thinking which involves active control over the cognitive processes engaged in learning.<br>  <br>  Metacognition involves:<br>  <br>  Knowledge: awareness of your own thought processes and learning styles, and knowledge of the strategies that might be used for different learning tasks. <br>  <br>  Control or self-regulation: keeping track of your thinking processes, regulating and evaluating them. <br>  <br>  While the study of metacognition originally gave educational psychologists insights into what differentiated successful students from their less successful peers, it is increasingly being used to inform teaching that aims to make students more aware of their learning processes, and show them how to regulate those processes for more effective learning throughout their lives.<br>  <br>  Lifelong learning may be most usefully thought of as a policy response by largely western governments to a changing world. These underlying changes are a move away from manufacturing to a services economy, the emergence of the knowledge economy and the decline of many traditional institutions which has been requiring individuals to become more active in managing their lives.<br>  This has led to the realization that formal learning, typically concentrated in the earlier stages of life, can no longer sustain an individual throughout their life. These policies and associated government publications reached their height in the 1990s. Extended response by academics pointed out the many flaws in this analysis, but more importantly that this shallow analysis by policy writers provided little real direction.<br>  <br>  Sometimes lifelong learning aims to provide educational opportunities outside standard educational systems — which can be cost-prohibitive, if it is available at all. On the other hand, formal administrative units devoted to this discipline exist in a number of universities. For example, the 'Academy of Lifelong Learning' is an administrative unit within the University-wide 'Professional and Continuing Studies' unit at the University of Delaware.  Another example is the Jagiellonian University Extension (Wszechnica Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego), which is one of the most comprehensive Polish centers for lifelong learning (open learning, organizational learning, community learning).|`|AwXPybcfaa	I think everyone has pretty much said what would be my primary responses to your question. <br>  <br>  All I will add is that, unlike any other field, our charge as teachers is to teach not just content area knowledge, but to instill an appreciation for that knowledge and for the habits of mind that will help students become motivated towards and growing from the pursuit of knowledge.

Remember F = ma (Newton's second law), so force has to be applied to accelerate or decelerate the car. Without external friction, the car will maintain its constant speed (Newton's first law).<br>  <br>  In the real world, where air resistance and other forms of friction exist, the engine must supply just enough force to counteract these in order to maintain constant speed.

A bibliography is a list of source materials that are used or consulted in the preparation of a work or that are referred to in the text. Your teacher is most likely wanting you list the sources in the book the author used... names of  people interviewed, when where they interviewedd .. you get the idea.,<br>  or if your teacher used the word Annotative bibliography, she wants you to write a paragraph explaining the book you read and how this source is relitive to the topic at hand. <br>  I hope this helps you... good luck... you can do it...<br>  BTW... you asked for "someone smart to help"  It takes someone smart to realize they need help and ask for it...

There's no psychiatry major, but if you want to be a psychiatrist, you have to go to med school, which means many more years of education after your 4-year college. So now I'm guessing when you ask for generals, you mean which college to go to to earn your bachelor's degree?<br>  <br>  There's a lot of variance between colleges about how much it costs to attend and how much living in dorms cost. It depends on the specific college. Generally, public colleges are much cheaper than private.<br>  <br>  California is a huge state, and there are over 300 colleges in California, so there are plenty of "good" ones, it depends on what you're looking for.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Because the schools can't know who cheated and who did not, and excluding everyone from a country would be discrimination.  That is true of U.S. students too, unfortunately.  Certainly it is not true that a country steals questions; there may be individuals who steal questions and share them with some others in their countries.  However, given the lousy scores you see from a lot of people from both India and China, it clearly is not the case that this is the norm there!<br>  <br>  No program accepts students solely on the basis of GMAT scores, so the students would have to be otherwise outstanding anyway to be admitted.  And if they are not, they probably wouldn't make it through the program.|`|zC7pkdK1aa	Why are you asking the question and then assuming it is true in your next one?|`|4xcqK9Jjaa	I have heard rumors of foreign students obtaining leaked copies of tests such as that one (and the GRE exams) well before the test date.

It is extremely difficult for foreign students to be admitted here for graduate school, and the requirements for them to be competitive are typically far higher than for American students.|`|8sk1ALQiaa	Or maybe GMAT can get different questions for their tests...O.O|`|u5a6HLDyaa	I can confirm that indians have been stealing the test for years
EI4fmPnoaa	Really depends on your aptitudes and interests, as well as the way the instructor approaches the subject. I teach history, and have some students who say mine is the most interesting class they've ever taken. (They tend to be engineering and hard sciences majors, for some reason.)  Then I have other students who seem to hate every moment of my classes, and can't wait to get out.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would suggest courses that don't duplicate things you've already taken. I teach an American Indian History class that a lot of folks seem to like, because it's a much different approach that the history they've had before -- it's much the same story, but from a very different point of view.

ZB0393Kkaa	$35K is doing pretty good for a new teacher. <br>  <br>  This is my first year teaching, and I'm teaching at a private school (of course that means I get paid even less). My salary this year was $23K. No kidding. But it's OK, because I'm single, living by myself, and live in a house that's completely paid for. If you're smart with your money, you can make it work. <br>  <br>  Teachers work hard, and sometimes I think we don't get paid enough. But you don't go into teaching for the money. You go into it because it's what you want to do and what you love to do. I don't get paid that much, but I sure enjoy my job. That to me is worth more than a fat paycheck.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	It depends on what day you ask me! Lol.It can be frustrating when you spend more time on paperwork than you want to, or when your weekend disappears in a flurry of marking. The money (at least in New Zealand) gets better (unless you work it out per hour!) but the hours are long. Teaching is  so much more than hours, money, or paperwork, though. It is life-changing (yours and theirs) and some of the most important work that gets done.<br>  Like others have said - don't go into it for the money - go into it because you can't imagine doing anything else|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	$35K is good for a new graduate.  Most business graduates don't make much more than that, and I've seen a lot in the high $20K's.  I get the same kind of comments from them about thinking they wouldn't have to watch their finances after graduating.  Most new graduates seem to think that they will start their careers where their parents are 30 years AFTER starting theirs!<br>  <br>  As for the rest, my guess is that this person had some fantasy of what teaching would be like which was not dispelled by her/his student teaching assignment.  When a student from an upscale suburb is suddenly placed in an inner-city school, it can be a shock.  However, for the real teachers, that shock can turn into a challenge, and I know people who have done the same and love it.  It sounds like this person was just not cut out for teaching, and it is a shame that this site only gives one person's opinion.|`|hfDohxp5aa	teaching is a job that takes heart devotion, no amount of money could pay for the stress, excess work and all that goes with being a teacher. It is like parenting 25-30 kids and a teacher is "on" all day as long as the students are with them and the district has zillions of requirements, there are zillions of discipline problems .......... I did teach for years and loved it, but I lost my health to the stress of the job and there is very little way to discipline the children in classrooms today, and they know it.<br>  In USA research , it states that the #2 highest stress job is teaching.|`|hc89tLJcaa	Sadly, the views of the person who wrote that critique are shared by many, many teachers all over the country. We are constantly disrespected and denied support by administrators. I LOVE teaching. But, it is NOT easy. There are many challenges. Many days, I want to just give it up and change careers. And, the problem has nothing to do with the children. It's the clueless administrators who make so many teachers miserable on the job. <br>  If your heart is in it, do it. But, PLEASE take care of yourself. And, if you're ever feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to take a day or two off. Do what you need to do in order to keep going. :)

98lD3z68aa	Cyber-, derived from the Greek word Kubernetes meaning Steersman , is used in the terms cybernetics, cyberspace, cyberpunk, cyberhomes and cyberhate denoting an internet-based activity.  <br>  In French the verb "entreprendre" means "to undertake", with "entre" coming from the Latin word meaning "between", and "prendre" meaning "to take". In French a person who performs a verb, has the ending of the verb changed to "eur", comparable to the "er" ending in English. "Unternehmer" (lit. "undertaker" in the literal sense of the word) is the high German equivalent and curiously, "Unternehmungs Forschung" is the German equivalent of Operations Research although the Anglo-Saxon model of the firm is fairly anti-thetical to the notion of management as a science.<br>  Thus, if we go to the Greek and take the first part of the word to mean steer, in American usage this means a neutered bull bovine.  Undertaker means undertaker in both France and the US>  so a cyberpreneur is either a business person who takes risks on the internet, or a mortician with no balls.|`|5T4r0Geiaa	doing business in cyber space<br>  <br>  im not so sure

Energy (and thus emissions) come under state government jurisdiction, which means that it is the responsibilty of the States to enforce.  The Commonwealth Government can override this (using S105 and S51 of the Constitutional forcing the states to comply but as yet will not consider it.).<br>  2. Australia is coal dependent for its energy; signing the agreement would mean that too much of our energy in the short term would have to come from elsewhere.  Whilst Australia is considering alternative sources (such as the wind farm approved for Victoria last week) it would be too difficult to transfer and get alternatives up and running quickly.  Incidently conservative estimates for establishing nuclear power are in the 20 year mark...<br>  3. This says nothing to the cost of energy to business and the economy in the short term.   As a state with a small population but high standard of living, our capacity to absorb increasing costs to upgrade cleaner technologies is limited, and cost prohibitive.<br>  4.

b1f833fbeb8f8dde93981f06e0dc7ab0aa	Die Antwort folgt aus der Definition des Stromflusses: Die Elektronen müssen für gleiche Stromrichtung in die entgegengesetzte Richtung wie die L?cher flie?en. Dafür gibt es zwei M?glichkeiten <br>    1. Am (ohmschen) Kontakt Halbleiter-Metall treffen L?cher und Elektronen paarweise aufeinander (Tü) und verschwinden per Rekombination. Der elektrisch flie?ende Strom ist dann gleich der Rekombinationsrate (= geladene Teilchen pro Zeiteinheit = Ladung pro Zeit = Strom). <br>    Bildhaft ausgedrückt injiziert das Metall Elektronen ins Valenzband, wo sie auf L?cher treffen - Exitus. <br>    2. Am ohmschen Kontakt werden Elektron Lochpaare generiert, die dann in entgegengesetzte Richtungen laufen (ü T). Der elektrische flie?ende Strom ist dann gleich der Generationsrate (= geladene Teilchen pro Zeiteinheit = Ladung pro Zeit = Strom). <br>    Bildhaft ausgedrückt zuzzelt das Metall Elektronen aus dem Valenzband, dabei bleiben L?cher zurück. <br>   Hilft das weiter? Ja! denn nun k?nnen wir nach Belieben mit L?chern oder Elektronen arbeiten. Ob wir vom Metall aus L?cher ins Valenzband des Halbleiters injizieren, oder ihm Elektronen raussaugen bleibt sich wie so vieles andere auch, (gehn' wir zu dir oder zu mir?) vom Ergebnis her gleich|`|cdf06bbe576bc200dde9a02f3e61d77baa	In Halbleitern wird der Ladungstransport oft durch einen Strom von positiv geladenen "L?chern", dem Defektelektronenstrom oder L?cherstrom beschrieben. Dabei handelt es sich jedoch um eine Hilfsvorstellung, da die Wanderung dieser L?cher durch eine Bewegung von Elektronen bewirkt wird. Die physikalische und die technische Stromrichtung im Halbleiter sind daher wie in einem gew?hnlichen Leiter entgegengesetzt.

SfCANIyDaa	O fascismo é uma doutrina totalitária de extrema-direita desenvolvida por Benito Mussolini na Itália, a partir de 1919, e durante seu governo (1922–1943 e 1943–1945). Fascismo deriva de fascio, nome de grupos políticos ou de militancia que surgiram na Itália entre fins do século XIX e come?o do século XX; mas também de fasces, que nos tempos do Império Romano era um símbolo dos magistrados: um machado cujo cabo era rodeado de varas, simbolizando o poder do Estado e a unidade do povo.

Originalmente é empregado para denominar o regime político implantado pelo italiano Benito Mussolini entre 1919 e 1943. <br>  <br>  Suas principais características s?o o nacionalismo, que tem a na??o como forma suprema de desenvolvimento, e o corporativismo, em que os sindicatos patronais e trabalhistas s?o os mediadores das rela??es trabalhistas. O fascismo nasce oficialmente em 1919, em Mil?o, quando Mussolini funda o movimento intitulado Fascio de Combatimento, cujos integrantes, os camisas pretas (camicie nere), se op?em à classe liberal. Em 1922, as milícias fascistas desfilam na Marcha sobre Roma. Pretendem tomar o poder militarmente e ocupam prédios públicos e esta??es ferroviárias, exigindo a forma??o de um novo gabinete. <br>  <br>  Mussolini é convocado para chefiar o governo do país, que atravessa profunda crise econ?mica, agravada por greves e manifesta??es de trabalhadores. Por meio de fraudes, os fascistas conseguem maioria parlamentar. Em seguida, Mussolini dissolve os partidos de oposi??o, persegue parlamentares oposicionistas e passa a governar por decretos. <br>  <br>  As características do regime s?o cerceamento da liberdade civil e política, unipartidarismo, derrota dos movimentos de esquerda e limita??o ao direito dos empresários de administrar sua for?a de trabalho. A política adotada, entretanto, é eficiente na moderniza??o da economia industrial e na diminui??o do desemprego

d7b35f7579f1ec0683f8aac7e9535dbdaa	No Brasil, chama-se de CDF. (lê-se cê-dê-éfe) de forma ofensiva àquele que se dedica exageradamente aos estudos. Usa-se a sigla ou acr?nimo CDF significando "cabe?a-de-ferro" (devido às diversas horas sentado estudando). é comum confundir com os Nerds. Entretanto, existe uma diferen?a básica entre nerds e CDFs: Enquanto no primeiro grupo encaixam-se os naturalmente interessados em ciências e computa??o - podendo mesmo n?o ir bem na escola, uma vez que muitos se consideram aut?nomos o suficiente na aprendizagem a ponto de n?o se preocuparem com a organiza??o de cadernos ou o dever de casa - o segundo costuma referir-se a jovens em idade ginasial que tem a escola como ponto central de suas vidas; ocasionalmente nem mesmo motivados pelo desejo de aprender, mas sim de agradar seus pais e professores.Sendo que,é o aluno no qual obtem maior nota da classe,sendo visto como pessoas a serem escolhidas para formar dupla para uma prova ou trabalho,sendo questionador e comunicativo|`|0xIB6Q9faa	já responderam:  C.U  DE FERRO!|`|182b21bba223895e6c6d49941af7ee58aa	Cebe?a de ferro|`|LVeNld9Gaa	Cu de ferro<br>  pq eles ficam muito tempo sentados estudando|`|LjGYEq0vaa	Channel Definition Format|`|T2EJJQ4uaa	tem varios significados, como ′′de frango,<br>  ′′de ferro e outros|`|db0b331a75b3fd2a89cb7ef6296f8914aa	CDF eh uma pessoa como eu, q so tira C D e F, nunca A nem B<br>  <br>  hehehehhe<br>  <br>  bjusssssssssss|`|db2a3460236dfdd40e113d40abae0721aa	cu de ferro, para designar pessoas extremamente dedicadas à estudos e afins, geralmente pessoas muito inteligentes|`|UMLhXLPKaa	Costas De Ferro<br>  <br>  é quando o aluno tira boas notas.<br>  <br>  é costas de ferro porque é como se esse aluno, por ser inteligente, levasse todos da sala nas costas.<br>  <br>  bjinhos|`|ZLp7Fkuyaa	Possivelmente è uma sigla, toda e qualquer marca é diretamente dependente da origem.<br>  Sabendo qual a origem, descobre-se o significado.<br>  Exemplo:<br>  INSS, Sabe-se que esta sigla significa ..., e que sua origem vem do Governo federal ... .<br>  Espero ter ajudado.|`|aUpbdAWJaa	CDF significa cú de ferro.|`|AA12005596	Ku de Ferro. é o cara nerd, muito estudioso, que n?o desgrada a bunda da cadeira para ficar estudando.

O restante é 'de ferro'.<br>  O significado é que a pessoa é do tipo 'super certinha', quer tudo nos 'trinks', n?o se refere só a estudos, mas também ao comportamento 'política e socialmente correto'. Por exemplo se você está em um local coletivo (como sala de aula, conferência, teatro) e conversa com a pessoa do lado (sem exagerar, pois aí ninguém agüenta!), imediatamente o CDF lhe chama a aten??o, por n?o estar respeitando o local.<br>  S?o tambèm chamados de 'Caxias', pejorativamente, no sentido de manter uma 'postura militar', perante os fatos.<br>  Pensam o seguinte: 'Se estamos na escola é para aprender, estudar e respeitar o professor', nada além disso, 'n?o é lugar para ficar brincando!'. Se vamos na Igreja 'é para ouvir o Padre ou Pastor e rezar'. 'Se nos casamos, n?o devemos separar'. Etc...<br>  O têrmo usado para os que se arrumam de forma compatível ao comportamento 'certinho' dos CDF ou Caxias é "almofadinha" ou "pó de arroz". O cabelo n?o tem um fio fora do lugar, a camisa é abotoada até o colarinho com ou sem gravata, a roupa impecável (limpa, bem passada, com vincos e engomadinha) e idem na vers?o feminina, sendo usado também para isso mais recentemente o têrmo 'Barbbie' ou 'Patricinha''. Geralmente s?o tipos intransigentes e insuportáveis.<br>  Quanto aos atuais 'nerds' ou 'Manés', o conceito é mais abrangente. pois seriam n?o só os que estudam e sejam do tipo certinho, como também os que n?o tem malícia, mais tímidos, os que n?o se 'enturmam com a galera'. Tanto s?o usados para definir um tipo de pessoa, como também temporariamente para chamar aten??o para uma atitude de momento de alguém que n?o seja daquele tipo em geral.<br>  Desculpe, me empolguei e fui além.|`|731a5c4e8732178c55d44afd6ca613d7aa	Há quem diga ( e é de muito mal gosto) que é: Cú DE FERRO.

1c634a57514479a9c0744f81a06dcef1aa	O que é uma ONG?<br>  <br>  A sigla ONG corresponde a organiza??o n?o-governamental — uma express?o que admite muitas interpreta??es. A defini??o textual (ou seja, aquilo que n?o é do governo) é t?o ampla que abrange qualquer organiza??o de natureza n?o-estatal. <br>  <br>  Em ambito mundial, a express?o surgiu pela primeira vez na Organiza??o das Na??es Unidas (ONU), após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, com o uso da denomina??o em inglês “Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)”, para designar organiza??es supranacionais e internacionais que n?o foram estabelecidas por acordos governamentais.<br>  <br>  Do ponto de vista formal, uma ONG é constituída pela vontade aut?noma de mulheres e homens, que se reúnem com a finalidade de promover objetivos comuns de forma n?o lucrativa. Nossa legisla??o prevê apenas três formatos institucionais para a constitui??o de uma organiza??o sem fins lucrativos, com essas características – associa??o, funda??o e organiza??o religiosa. Por n?o ter objetivos confessionais, juridicamente toda ONG é uma associa??o civil ou uma funda??o privada. <br>  <br>  No entanto, nem toda associa??o civil ou funda??o é uma ONG. Entre clubes recreativos, hospitais e universidades privadas, asilos, associa??es de bairro, creches, funda??es e institutos empresariais, associa??es de produtores rurais, associa??es comerciais, clubes de futebol, associa??es civis de benefício mútuo, etc. e ONGs, temos objetivos e atua??es bastante distintos, às vezes, até opostos. <br>  <br>  No Brasil, a express?o era habitualmente relacionada a um universo de organiza??es que surgiu, em grande parte, nas décadas de 1970 e 1980, apoiando organiza??es populares, com objetivos de promo??o da cidadania, defesa de direitos e luta pela democracia política e social. As primeiras ONGs nasceram em sintonia com as demandas e dinamicas dos movimentos sociais, com ênfase nos trabalhos de educa??o popular e de atua??o na elabora??o e controle social das políticas públicas.<br>  <br>  Ao longo da década de 1990, com o surgimento de novas organiza??es privadas sem fins lucrativos trazendo perfis e perspectivas de atua??o social muito diversas, o termo ONG acabou sendo utilizado por um conjunto grande de organiza??es, que muitas vezes n?o guardam semelhan?as entre si. Como afirma a antropóloga Leilah Landim “O nome ONG n?o é mais revelador, como ele era, de um segmento dentro das organiza??es da sociedade civil brasileira”.|`|AA12005596	Organiza??es n?o-governamentais (ou ONG) s?o associa??es da sociedade civil, sem fins lucrativos, que desenvolvem ac??es em diferentes áreas e que, geralmente, mobilizam a opini?o pública e o apoio da popula??o para melhorar determinados aspectos da sociedade.|`|fc9f3558499f81d447347723d4747460aa	Organiza??es n?o-governamentais, entidades assistenciais e sociais com fundo baseado em doa??es, que visa grandes projetos sem vinculo governamental.|`|83d110857c66727cc5700288ad9e9812aa	ONG é "Organiza??o N?o Governamental"<br>  A propósito abaixo transcrevo uma peti??o que, se bem n?8o provem de nenhuma ONG, também é para uma finalidade justa:<br>  ASSINA Aí, GENTE, POR FAVOR!<br>  N?O CUSTA NADA, é SEGURO E VAI AJUDAR A ACABAR COM O <br>  CAMPO DE EXTERMíNIO DO CCZ, VERGONHA DA SúDE PúBLICA DA CIDADE DE CAMPO GRANDE/MS.<br>  <br>  <br>  Caros amigos,<br>  A matan?a continua!<br>  Só parará quando, unidos, conseguirmos aplacar a arrogancia daqueles que se <br>  julgam acima de todos, inclusive da Lei.<br>  Por gentileza, assinem a peti??o on line em favor de nossos c?es que est?o sendo exterminados, vítimas de uma inadequada política de administra??o de  saúde pública.<br>  Vidas ser?o salvas.<br>  ab?<br>  Maria Lúcia Metello<br>  Abrigo dos Bichos<br>  <br>  From: "André Luis Soares da Fonseca" <afonseca@nin.ufms.br><br>  To: <undisclosed-recipients:><br>  Sent: Saturday, May 19, 2007 7:19 PM<br>  Subject: Peti??o contra a Eutanásia de C?es ....<br>  <br>  Pessoal,<br>  Acabei de criar uma peti??o on line a ser enviada para a Secretaria de <br>  Saúde Pública de Campo Grande/MS em repúdio à eutanásia de c?es suspeitos de Leishmaniose.<br>  Entrem no site abaixo e assinem, se concordarem.<br>  As pessoas de bem precisam fazer algo.<br>  Divulguem entre nossos amigos<br>  Abs<br>  <br>  André<br>  <br>   Prof. André Luis Soares da Fonseca, MSc.<br>  DPA/CCBS<br>  Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul - UFMS<br>  "O que mais preocupa n?o é o grito dos violentos, nem dos corruptos, nem  dos sem-ética.

No Brasil, três figuras jurídicas correspondentes no novo Código Civil comp?em o Terceiro Setor: associa??es, funda??es e organiza??es religiosas (que foram recentemente consideradas como uma terceira categoria).|`|SRUG2lXMaa	As ONGs (organiza??es n?o governamentais) s?o entidades de direito civil, sem fins lucrativos nem vínculos com governos, sindicatos ou partidos políticos. Elas atuam em vários ramos de atividade - trabalham com projetos sociais e de promo??o da cidadania, defendem o meio ambiente e os direitos das minorias e fazem campanhas contra a discrimina??o.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  ONGs<br>  <br>  ONG é sigla de Organiza??o N?o-Governamental. Sua designa??o negativa (n?o-governamental) de fato revela um cunho bastante interessante de independência e ocupa??o do espa?o público por quem n?o é do governo. N?o há no direito brasileiro qualquer designa??o de ONG, n?o há uma espécie de sociedade chamada ONG no Brasil, mas um reconhecimento supralegal, de cunho cultural, político e sociológico que está em vigor mundo afora. Algumas as quais conhecemos n?o merecem o termo 'organiza??o' (uma quantidade alarmante!), outras s?o profundamente governistas ou governamentais, já ouvi até falar de ODGs ou organiza??es dependentes de governos... enfim, n?o há regra, mas há um conceito.<br>  <br>  As regras da maior parte dessas organiza?oes s?o internas, dispostas em um estatuto, o que lhes dá um cunho institucional, distinto da natureza meramente contratual das sociedades de responsabilidade limitada, por exemplo. Os tipos societários brasileiros, em sua maioria, s?o, em essência, sociedades pessoais, ou de pessoas, o que quer dizer que gravitam em torno dos interesses das pessoas que comp?em seu quadro societário. Já as sociedades institucionais têm um objetivo, regras de administra??o interna e critérios para a admiss?o de novas pessoas aos quadros sociais. Isso significa dizer que as pessoas, ao invés de submeterem a pessoa jurídica a seus interesses pessoais (como nas sociedades profissionais, por exemplo), aderem aos interesses da sociedade (ou associa??o), submetendo-se às suas regras internas. O movimento é justamente o inverso. Portanto, por institucionais compreendem-se aquelas pessoas jurídicas que têm uma existência para o cumprimento de determinado fim, que está acima dos interesses pessoais dos sócios. Assim, em geral, s?o associa??es, e n?o sociedades, embora esse último conceito jurídico também n?o seja determinado por lei, mas por entendimento doutrinário jurídico.<br>  <br>  Em geral, as ONGs s?o constituídas para fins n?o econ?micos e finalidade n?o lucrativa. Nada impede, contudo, que tenham fins econ?micos ou atividades de cunho econ?mico, mas cumpre saber distingui-las das sociedades comerciais, cuja característica é ter atividade econ?mica, produzir lucro e dividi-lo entre os sócios. Por isso, em sua maior parte, sua natureza é civil.<br>  <br>  Todas as ONGs que conhe?o e assim reconhe?o s?o, na verdade, veículos para a participa??o dos indivíduos em atividades e finalidades de caráter público. Logo, muitas vezes, s?o veículos de democracia direta, de ocupa??o do espa?o público, de mobiliza??o da sociedade civil para executar tarefas e atividades que beneficiam a todos genericamente, a todo o planeta.<br>  <br>  Em resumo: ONGs n?o existem em nosso ordenamento jurídico. S?o um fen?meno mundial onde a sociedade civil se organiza espontaneamente para a execu??o de certo tipo de atividade cujo cunho, o caráter, é de interesse público. A forma societária mais utilizada é a da associa??o civil (em contrapartida às organiza??es públicas e as organiza??es comerciais). S?o regidas por estatutos, têm finalidade n?o econ?mica e n?o lucrativa. Funda??es também podem vir a ser genericamente reconhecidas como ONGs.<br>  <br>  T+<br>  bjus<br>  <br>  Existentes desde a década de 20, só a partir dos anos 60 as ONGs passam a lutar pelos direitos específicos da popula??o. Sua relevancia no cenário internacional cresce a partir da década de 80, com o estabelecimento de parcerias com governos e organismos internacionais para a elabora??o de políticas públicas.<br>  <br>  As ONGs sobrevivem gra?as às doa??es e ao trabalho voluntário de militantes e simpatizantes. Costumam realizar campanhas de arrecada??o e, em alguns casos, cobram pela presta??o de servi?os como forma de obter receita. Podem também receber ajuda e recursos de empresas, entidades privadas, governos e organismos internacionais.
