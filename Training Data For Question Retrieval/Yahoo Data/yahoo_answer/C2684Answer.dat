You ll have to wait until she's ready to heat up. :)|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Cats can go into heat as early as 4 months of age. <br>  <br>  Why on Earth would you want to backyard breed her? Don't you think there are enough homeless cats being euthanized in shelters without people backyard breeding and adding poorly bred cats to the overpopulation problem?<br>  <br>  There's a lot more to breeding than putting a male and a female animal together and making babies. You could be putting your female at serious risk if you breed her. Please read:<br>  <a href="http://www.cat-world.com.au/BackyardBreeder.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cat-world.com.au/BackyardBree...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Why not get her spayed instead? Fixing your female has a lot of health benefits as well as ensuring that they won't add to the pet overpopulation. Spaying before the first heat cycle is highly recommended and healthiest in females as it reduces the chances of mammary gland cancer later in life to near zero, but even spaying afterwards has a lot of health benefits. Spaying eliminates the chances of uterine and ovarian cancer as well as eliminating the chances of pyometra (a deadly uterine infection). Every heat cycle a female goes through increases her chances of developing mammary, ovarian, or uterine cancer later in life as well as putting her at risk for developing pyometra. <br>  <br>  I'd get your Siamese fixed as well. Neutering males eliminates all chances of testicular cancer as well as having behavioral benefits (reduces the urge to escape and roam in search of a mate, cuts down on aggression, and if done before the animal begins spraying/marking upon reaching sexual maturity, they may well never spray/mark at all!)

You ask a question on Yahoo Answers, and when folks give you great info you are totally rude to them, not even bothering to consider what they are trying to tell you.<br>  <br>  As far as I am concerned, if you have to ask the question, you have no business breeding a cat in the first place. After all knowing about the anatomy and physiology of felines would seem to me to be the most importamt requirement to breed one's cat. It is not just putting two cats together and hoping for the best. <br>  <br>  So why not save your "hissy fit" for someone else? Most of the people who take the time to answer questions do it out of love for cats, and spend time researching for the best answers.<br>  <br>  Oh.. and of course you will have to continue breeding her, as cats who go into heat repeatedly without pregnancy often develop uterine infections. Then there is the worry of mammary cancer in cats that have not been spayed before their first heat. <br>  <br>  But it is probably better that I keep my mouth shut as you are obviously insisting on your own way and not taking the suggestions to heart that have been made which will save your cat possible complications which may result in losing her altogether.<br>  <br>  My two cents for what it is worth!!<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Former CFA Registered Breeder of Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs.
m1lu7CFJaa	Watch for now.  Try feeding him cooked white rice later, it's easier on their stomachs.  If he still refuses to eat you may want to take him to the vet.  Make sure during this time though that he is still getting plenty of fluids.  You can always add some gatorade to his water to make sure he doesn't become dehydrated - my dogs are partial to the lemon/lime flavor.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	I would watch for now. The other night my puppy had diarrhea and threw up twice and wasnt wanting to eat. I kept an eye on him kept trying to offer water so he wouldnt get dehydrated. He slept for a REALLY long time but woke up the next day feeling much better! He could just have an upselt stomach but if the vomiting continues or gets worse make sure to take him to vet. Good luck.|`|JltE5LIHaa	Starve him for 24hrs and only give water little and often. If he gets worse within that time frame get him to the vet straight away. If all is well introduce food in small quantities and make it bland, steamed/boiled chicken or rice. If it come back up go to vet if it stays down re introduce the usual food slowly and in small amounts.|`|KuUx34hCaa	Have a vet. check him out Boxers are pron to have digestive problems how ever out of all the Boxers I've had I only had one with the problem BUT HE NEEDS to be check out by your Vet to make sure he dose not have internal parasites;round worms plus other can cause this problem BE SURE TO HAVE HIM CHECKED BY A VET> puppies should be wormed regularly! good luck Ardy|`|UX0Ys5bKaa	MAKE SURE HE DRINKS WATER cause if dogs barf and it a light<br>    coler there dehydrated, is the food hard or soft cause if it is soft thats<br>  bad for their teeth, change the food if they dont eat take it to a vet?|`|xEHECtjraa	just wait and watch most likely just a bout of upset stomach <br>   try giving him cottage cheese or cooked rice that will help if you want|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	watch his behavior|`|JsBb732Maa	Watch for now, but if he doesn't eat this afternoon and throws up a lot more then time for a vet visit. Hope he gets to feeling better. :-)|`|9kTejB0uaa	There are loads of enteritis-like bugs always going round the dog world - the good news is that once they recover from one, chances are they won't pick it up again.  However, although hopefully this is just an uncomplicated tummy bug, if he's also doing diarrhoea and the vomiting is frequent, you do have to be aware he could become dehydrated.  And this is serious and needs veterinary treatment to shut him down.  At this age, you can withhold food (maybe just one meal), to give his system time to recover.  No point putting food in if it's only going to upchucked again.  <br>  <br>  Obviously if you are very worried about him, if he deteriorates, you need to get him to your vet.  Otherwise leave him, offer him some boiled chicken, or white fish with a little rice.  If he doesn't want to eat, don't force him, but call the vet.  Natural yogurt can help clear up uncomplicated tummy upsets btw.|`|5bYpbodUaa	Does your dog like to get into everything? Eat anything in sight? Dogs sometimes will do that. He could have gotten into something and ate it, and now it is blocking his stomach/intestines. What is he throwing up? Is there anything coming out other than liquid/food? <br>  <br>  I would take him to the vet so they can do an X-Ray to make sure there is nothing blocking his digestive track. This can end up fatal for your dog if not taken care of right away.  <br>  <br>  Hope your dog feels better soon.  Poor little guy.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	How is his behavior?  Is he acting normally or acting lethargic and sick or in a distress? Is he drinking water? If lethargic and sick or in distress and not drinking water and keeping it down, I'd get to a vet right away.  If he is otherwise acting fine and happy, provide water, withhold food for a day and put him on a bland diet of white rice and baked chicken or cottage cheese tonight.  If that doesn't stay down, off to the vet.  If it gets worse today, vet right away.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Research bloat in dogs.  This is a condition common in barrel chested dogs where the stomach twists & the intestines becomes blocked causing the dog to vomit.  It manly happens when a dog is fed & then are allowed to be active too soon.  I don't know if this is your dogs problem but worth looking into .|`|ezzSeBnLaa	My german short hair pup had the same thing happen to him a few months ago. He got into the compost bin and ate some things that didn't agree with him. I took him to the vet, and the only thing she did was give him an anti-nausea shot and told me to feed him boiled chicken and rice and make sure he drank lots of water. I'd try that first and if he still doesn't eat, then take him to the vet. It cost us over $200 for this info. :)
nY1nq9hCaa	Depend what you are breeding, animals can have up to 1, 5 or more baby's in a litter.  You have to think how much cost is involved in feeding and vet bills.  Also siblings can fight quite viciously if they are in close contact all the time.  <br>  <br>  I have kept one pup from the litter and i have the mother but it is risky if you do not neuter.<br>  <br>  Personally i would not keep all of the litter and i would not breed anything i was not sure that i could re home.  This should go for humans too lol|`|2O58btqxaa	depends what animal it is you could end up with loads of pets|`|JGq9rKBOaa	I firmly believe that anyone breeding any animal should only do so for the betterment of the species. Wanting to see cute babies, wanting to show your children "the miracle of birth," wanting more pets like the one you already have - even if you keep all of the babies, those are selfish reasons.<br>  <br>  Breeders of any species should strive to breed healthy animals with a good temperament that conform to breed standards - not just to make more of those animals. There's no shortage of pets out there, and there CERTAINLY isn't a shortage of sickly, poorly-bred pets. <br>  <br>  Breeding animals is not risk-free. Guinea pigs, for example, have an exceptionally high rate of birth complications - 25% of pregnancies is one of the figures I've heard. Even if that's exaggerated, there is still a significant risk to ANY female during pregnancy, birth, and even afterward.<br>  <br>  Why risk the life of your beloved pets for selfish reasons? And especially with animals like dogs and rabbits, where neutering is commonplace, having an unaltered animal is just setting them up for an unhappy life - rabbits especially show a lot of frustration and sexual aggression if they're not either altered or breeding constantly. In wild rabbits, the desire to breed constantly ensures that the species doesn't die out, but in captivity, that desire leads to aggression and behavior problems. Having one litter of rabbits will just result in 10 unhappy rabbits.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Its pretty impossible to keep all of the babies of your pets unless they only have 2 or three. Hamster can have 20 babies...if they're syrians thats 20 seperate cages, even if they are dwarves a cage to house 10 would be so big and fighting would occur. Unless you keep a species of animal that only has five or so babies its not realistic.|`|YpEswTQdaa	I personally see that as okay,i suppose some people would say,you could rescue more,rather than breed.

dnl66ZXTaa	Your molllies will breed no matter what but things like the temperature and things like that.  It also helps to seperate them from each other for a few days.  If you have a seperate breeding tank put 1 to 2 female mollies in the breeding tank and set it closer to your other tank so your male molly can see them.  After atleast 2 days put the male molly with the famale mollies and they will breed.   Also remember when you have the fry  your bigger fish will eat them so you need a breeding tank to keep the female molly in by herself so after she has them none of the other fish will eat the fry.<br>  <br>  The famle molly will begin to eat her babies but only after around 12 hours after she gives birth. Her hormones are too active after the birth to let her eat for awhile. Good Luck!|`|AraBfesHaa	You don't have to encourage anything.  Just put a male and a female together.  That's all you need to do.  If they're at least adolescents, you'll have fry.  But be prepared,  She'll store the sperm from that one mating and have fry every 4 weeks for up to 6 months, and up to 80+ at a time (her first batch will most likely be smaller, though, then they continually increase  number)<br>  Then when those fry are about 2 or 3 months old, they'll all start breeding too.  So do the math and figure out if you have enough room in your house to have enough tanks to house them all.  You can't make them start breeding until they're ready, but you also can't make them stop when you're overwhelmed by them. (and you soon will be)

Rw7gi86Naa	Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or use a device that delivers a harmless static shock or that produces a loud noise when the cat comes near, to help redirect kitty to his litter box. Adding a room deodorizer with a scent the cat finds offensive - such as a strong citrus or floral - can also keep the cat away from the area. <br>  <br>  When to See the Vet <br>  If your cat continues to eliminate outside of the litter box, a trip to the vet is in order to check for health problems. No behavior techniques will help a cat with a problem that requires the attention of a veterinarian. <br>  Urinary tract infections are a common cause of litter box probl|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	You could try getting rid of all the old litter in the box and scrubbing the box out. Maybe the friend didn't clean the box as good as you do. Our cats will not step food into a stinky litter box. When you put the new litter in of course if the cat poops on the floor toss the poop and the cat back into the box.|`|AA12072958	Try changing the brand of litter.  If that doesn't work, take her to the vet b/c most likely there's a medical reason responsible for her behavior.  When cats act out it's usually b/c they're trying to tell you something is wrong and pooping/peeing outside the litter box is a sure sign.  Good luck!|`|WLNX00c3aa	have you ruled out any issues with the cat? take her to the vet?<br>  <br>  when i was younger, our cat did that to my mom. she would leave us 'presents' everywhere telling us there was something wrong with her. we took her to the vet right away and found she had urinary track infection.<br>  <br>  is she even hitting the box at all? is the litter box clean?  some cats must have the litter box completely clean and odor free.|`|yxJKgf9Faa	hii your cat me be choosing to do her duties else where becauseshe ma be stressed or if her litterbox isnt cleaned to her standards she will definately not go in cats are clean animals make sure all solid waste is removed everyday and thoroughly change and clean the litterbox every 4 days <br>  <br>  hope this helps x
TSc8OE4vaa	Do you take her inside as soon as she finishes her business?  If you do, let her stay outside and play a little while after she finishes.  If you bring her straight in, she knows she won't be able to stay out and play so she plays before she goes.|`|n8jrLDblaa	Her being easily distracted is likely due to lack of proper exercise, and lack of sufficient time exploring outside.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter her breed...how big or small....walks are NECESSITY.<br>  <br>  Being inside all day every day will bore a dog stiff, making the occasional trips outdoors to potty seem overwhelming with new stimuli.<br>  <br>  Start walking her every day, twice a day if possible. Switch up the route from time to time...let her explore her surroundings. You will see a change in the behavior.|`|teDI6RQ8aa	Take her walking, and don't let her stop to sniff and explore.  Only stop to let her potty.<br>  <br>  I learned to walk my dogs around the yard and not let them stop and get distracted.  After they go potty is when I let them do what they want(within reason).|`|KuUx34hCaa	I would keep her walking around & saying go potty & keep with it until she goes! it will happen good luck Ardy this is what I have done
cii9XShcaa	It's normally not the litterbox but rather the waste. If the animals waste didn't smell so bad, then the litterbox wouldn't. When I fed my cats dry food, Kitten Iams, her poop smelled horrible which in turn, made the litterbox stink. I covered my nose when scooping her box and disposing the bag in her trashcan. Once I switched her to a high quality canned food, AvoDerm Select Cuts, then smell decrease dramatically but was still there. When I switched her to half canned/half raw, there was hardly any smell at all from her poop, which of course, made the litterbox not stink at all nor did her trashcan where I disposed of her waste. So really, it's the cat's diet, not the litter, that should be considered in changing.<br>  <br>  Edit: I forgot to add that I also use Swheat Scoop. I like the fact that it's natural, there's no dust, and no chemicals. When I fed my cat dry, I tried Swheat Scoop and it hardly covered the smell of her poop. Now that I'm feeding her half canned/half raw, I went back to Swheat Scoop from Tidy Cats and Fresh Step, and there's very little, if any, odor at all now. Yes it's def more expensive to feed canned and raw, but I feel that in the long run, she won't have to hardly ever go to the Vet for health problems since her diet is very healthy. Only thing I can fathom is if she breaks a bone. But I'd rather spend $35-65 a month on food than spend $500 or more for surgery from a health problem or a spend money for reoccurring monthly medicine expense. As far as the rabbit's diet, I have no idea. lol Good luck!|`|MmRDzhaHaa	There is now a special scented powder that you sprinkle on to prevent the smell! but be care full as some can be allergic to it(makes them sneeze) but not all ways!|`|yxJKgf9Faa	hiii in the supermarkets you can buy litter freshner which is like granules which you sprinkle on to the litter everytime it begins to stink add it when doin the rountinal clean aswell it really works and keeps the litterbox totally odour free its certainly safe for cats but im not to sure about rabbits.....it should be though <br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I assume this is like a corn or wheat based litter?  I tried it and hated it.  I have 2 cats and the litter smelled sour and stinky all the time.  I had to switch back to clay based and now it's fine.  The only other alternative you have is to use that newspaper litter, like Yesterdays News (I think its called).|`|se27sAUwaa	There's all kinds of "freshener" products for kitty litter. They have aerosoles, crystals, scented hypoallergenic litterbox liners, and so on. I think the food is most important though. You may want to switch to a healthier brand.|`|pYVRcoPsaa	Its always good to really get a good scrub to the litter boxes every so many months. We bleach ours and then rewash to make sure the bleach is out. That will kill the odor that occurs from remnants on the box.
sgMno1PRaa	You must do a fishless cycle. You need a heater and thermometre. <br>  You must do a fishless cycle to get the water ready for the fish. Google fishless cycle for more info if you dont know what it is - or email me.<br>  You need to do a small water change each week - about 15/20% of the water.<br>  You never change all the water<br>  You must buy some water condtioner to get rid of chlorine.<br>  You can just buy the usual flake food to feed them - it says tropical fish food on the box.<br>  Some tropical fish also need a varied diet. So in your local fish shop buy some frozen live food such as blood worm - they come in blocks so you just defrost them in some water - from your tank - and then empty into your tank for fish to eat. <br>  Tropical fish usually need big tanks as well and alot of them like to be in shoals - groups of 6 or more.<br>  Always research the name of the fish you want before buying it.<br>  Fish shop people are very good at conning people and unexperienced fish keepers and you end up buying everything which is wrong and then your fish are un happy and usually die.<br>  I very useful sight is fishkeeping.co.uk They are very experienced and wont let you get it wrong.<br>  It is not easy keeping fish and you will have to buy water test kits because the water needs to be ok for the fish otherwise they do die and its a waste of time.|`|wnnudNp5aa	As Gemma said, get a book or 3 about keeping a tropical aquarium. They are readily available at any pet store, book store, or even your local library. They also nearly always have lots of pretty pictures that may give you some decorating ideas for your tank. Do your research, and you can avoid the expense and heartbreak of waking up to a tankful of dead fish. Good luck!|`|9wtpCNb6aa	Well yes there is a difference.  Not in the way you would feed them.  In a tropical tank your going to need a heater, as tropical fish, coming from tropical climates need warm water to live!  Your best getting a filter in your tank as well which should clean away most of the crap thats in there such as old food and poo.  However you still need to clean the tank.<br>  <br>  You can get books on how to keep tropical fish so i'd invest in one of them.  Better to know what your doing rather than just going for it and killing them all!!|`|K4rP4A0naa	The only difference is the water temp. Everything else depends on what species of fish you want to keep.<br>  <br>  You can have a planted aquarium with live plants or have other decorations.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is research what fishes you like and see what their natural habitat and food requirements are. Either replicate their natural habitat or not, that's personal choice. Feed them what is recommended at a website like www.liveaquaria.com which has plenty of good info. Best thing to do is give them a variety of foods, like fresh, prepared flake or pellets and live feed like bloodworms.<br>  <br>  Make sure you do (at least) monthly water changes of 20% and keep any aerosols far away from the tank. Most people lose fishes from things like air freshener and bug spray.<br>  <br>  Do lots of research and you'll enjoy your fish for years.|`|3oEyjsxAaa	Its the same, all the same rules apply. In my opinion keeping goldfish is harder in terms of aquarium maintaince than jeeping tropical fish on the go... basically due to their high ammonia output and huge poos.<br>  Tropical tanks are easier to run, albeit at the cost of the heater
jOPLgE1Maa	After getting my border collie/lab mix past 1 years old, I have an opinion as to why these dogs end up as rescue cantidates. Don't get me wrong, as my dog is worth her weight in laughs and fun. Your dog is already a year old, but when these pups are small, and if they favor the border collie genetics, they are absolutely an unbelievable nuclear powerhouse of energy. <br>  <br>  It is quite likely that the former owner(s) gave up on this dog too early, or destroyed their relationship with the dog by being heavy handed.  My borador certainly has tried my patience more than once, but she is incredibly entertaining( a real clown sometimes ), smart, very affectionate, and quite like having a small child who can be a brat at times.<br>  <br>  If you have been looking at opinions about these dogs, you tend to see the border collie folks continually stating that the dog must have a "job". Well, that's a little tough if you're not a sheep herder. They do require LOTS of exercise, but I have found that one of the keys to keeping my dog content is to make sure that she has an opportunity to run FuLL SPEED until she chooses to slow down. I think these full speed dashes after tennis balls helps satisfy both her work ethic( she gathers the balls and keeps track of them like they are her sheep), and her exercise demands. <br>  <br>  My dog can be rather pushy, and that is a reflection of the border collie in her. When these dogs were bred over the years, one of the characteristics that was valued was the ability to override the shepard's commands in certain situations. The dog has to be a little pushy to risk that, but if there was a sheep missing from the herd, the dog often knew where it was better than the boss, so they can, and will, take ownership in certain situations.<br>  <br>  As far as that cat, he was there first. If there is a problem between the two, it will be getting the cat used to the dog. I doubt the dog will give or instigate any problems. My parents had a huge tomcat before they got a border collie from my sister. The dog ALWAYS gave the cat a wide berth if he was in a fiesty mood. The cat got used to her pretty quickly. The border collie side tends to identify with the owner(s), so much that they often completely ignore other dogs, and can get to the point where they don't like other dogs. If she is not social, you will need to recify that.<br>  <br>  It's good that you're home alot, as like everybody that knows about these dogs understands, that when they get bored , they WILL find something to do, and odds are you won't appreciate their choice. One thing to be cautioned on is that they learn very quickly, so make sure that you watch her like a hawk at first and correct bad behavior. Anything left uncorrected could go on for years.<br>  <br>  Obviously, each dog has it's own personality, and yours might be very laid back, but doubtful since it's a rescue dog. As far as risking a rescue dog, I think that's great that you want give a second chance. Border collies and Labs both mature late, but I promise you they get easier from here on out. I would not give up my borador for ANY price. They take a little more work than other breeds, but if you are willing to do the training and exercise, you will continually be amazed at the intellect, interaction, affection, and loyalty . I have had numerous dogs over the years and I have had some good ones, but this one is special. More work than the others ? Sure, but the payoff is WAY more than worth it.|`|tXWvoYNfaa	I have both; a lab and a border collie.<br>  <br>  If you do not have time to exercise your dog, I would go just for a pure lab.<br>  <br>  Labs are very loving and great pets. <br>  <br>  Border collies need to be kept busy or they can be very destructive to your house and lawn.  Also, despite what some say, I do not think they make very good pets for children due to their strong herding instincts. <br>  <br>  I think a mix could go either way.  I think you take a gamble when you select a lab/border collie mix.|`|c5701f3ddbef284fd6755e3722e83b6baa	First and foremost...God bless you for adopting a dog from a shelter.  These dogs need homes....and the dog will know they are being rescued.  <br>  <br>  Labs (I have one) and border collies are wonderful smart dogs.  Great for families.  They both need a lot of exercise....especially the border collies.  If you get this dog, please let it run....a lot.|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Both labs and collies are very hyperactive dogs with high energy levels, it will be a nice dog for your daughter as long as you train it well. The problem with my Border Collie is that she used to jump up a lot, shes stopped doing that as much now, but because I don't have children or know many children she still likes to jump up at them so I have to be careful when I take her out. She's only being friendly but you can imagine the size of her compared to a child and she's likely to knock them over. Just make sure you teach your dog not to jump up at your child and not to be too boisterous. Make sure you take it for long walks to release some of that energy and give it mental stimulation and also teach your daughter how to behave and respect dogs so that they will have a good relationship :)|`|Uigvko5Laa	Don't judge a dog by it's breed(s), each dog is an indiviual especially when it comes to rescues and mixes. On top of that, it is the shelter and our best guess when it comes to defining a breed. In certain shelters in our area any b/w dog with short hair is an automatic bc/lab mix especially since bc rescue is active in their area. As a rescuer, i keep the shelters definition of breed unless it is an obvious mistake. On top of that, most people view labs as more mellow so they feel this makes the dog more adoptable than say a hound/bc or pit/bc mix. The key is read the dogs profile closly and watch for ques on temperment and overall personality.<br>  <br>  PS: I've had both hyper and coach potato bc/mix dogs who could pass as bc/lab mixes.|`|n8jrLDblaa	It depends on the individual dog.<br>  <br>  The temperament of a mixed breed cannot be predicted necessarily. It may lean toward the labrador side, or exhibit more of the border collie's traits. To prepare yourself beforehand, research the temperaments of both breeds, and assume for the meantime that the mix you are considering will exhibit the best and worst qualities of both.|`|6ZuMAvs2aa	Border Collies tend to be very intelligent and full of energy, so they need work that is both mentally and physically stimulating. <br>  <br>  As for Labradors...it depends on their breeding. The Lab I owned in the past was a rescue, and he was extremely lazy and not too bright. Working lines, however, have needs similar to the collies. <br>  <br>  Mixed-bred dogs are challenging when it comes to predictability. One pup can range in behavior and appearance from another of the same litter.|`|JBPsePnwaa	I love that you are going to the rescue.  Border Collies are working dogs so don't expect a couch potato, and they are extremely intelligent and can get destructive if bored.  Labs are all around good guys which might help with the over achiever side but are very food orientated and if not watched they can get overweight .  Judge each dog by his actions.  Look for one who is curious, but not jumpy or cowering in the corner.  Ask questions of the workers.  They have had time to get to know each dog.  Take your time, have fun and good luck.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I had retriever (either golden or lab - we never could tell which)/border collie mix and she was the smartest, most intuitive dog I ever owned and very sweet.

There is a humane society here that only charges $20.00 for toy/small males $40.00 for toy/small females. My aunt took her male to the vet and it was $260.00.

They usually do it by how big the dog is. One of my friends got their shih tzu neutered for 58 dollars down here in Alabama.|`|1pbTmda6aa	When I had my Schnauzer neutered, it was over $200 simply because it was an invasive surgery for the fact that his testicles never dropped.  They had to cut into his abdomen to remove them making it cost more.  A lot of shelters will do a once or twice a year special and charge very little to help those who maybe can't afford it and to help keep the pet population down.  Call around to shelters and see if they do offer yearly specials.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I am getting my puppy neuetered in two weeks.  At the vet down the road they quoted me at $311.

I would call around to ask for different prices.|`|qnXfKk4Kaa	Speaking of Shih-Tzu's I got one January 15 and she is such a doll.  Anyway, neutering costs vary.

AraBfesHaa	You put 2 fish in a 1 gallon tank.  That caused an ammonia spike and killed them.  That "tank" is way too small for any fish.  Take it back and get something bigger.<br>  Also, was the water dechlorinated before you put them in, and was it the right temperature?  They need a warm temperature, being tropical fish.  They also need a filter and an air bubbler.<br>  Even a 10 gallon tank wouldn't last long for 1 male and 1 female guppie.  In a month you'd have a batch of fry.  Not only that, but with one breeding, she would have had fry every month for 6 months, and up to 80 at a time.  After the fry reached 2-3 months old, they would have been reproducing also.<br>  If you don't have a tank large enough to house many many fish, don't get a male and female livebearer of any kind.  They all do the same thing, and in a couple of months you'll be back on here begging us to tell you how to stop them from having any more fry!<br>  Get a 10-gallon tank and 6 or so tetras (they like be in schools of 6 or so like fish) They're small and won't overpopulate like the livebearers will.<br>  You can also get an apple, (mystery) snail to eat any algae that might grow in the tank.  But tetras are also warm water fish so you'll need a heater.  It would be best to put them in though, only 2 or 3 at a time, wait till ammonia is back down to zero before adding the next 2 or 3 etc.<br>  If you're still interested in guppies, get only males.  Females most likely will be pregnant when you buy them, and you'll have the same problem stated above.<br>  Cold water, chlorine, and ammonia, and lack of oxygen if you didn't have a bubbler.  any or all 4 could have caused the death of the fish|`|wnnudNp5aa	Your tank was too small, and I'm betting you didn't cycle it. Before you kill any more guppies, please go to your local pet store, book store, or public library and get a book or 3 on aquarium keeping. It will tell you all the preparations you need to make to a tank before you ever bring home your first fish. If you can find a book especially about guppies, that would be invaluable to your endeavor.<br>  There's enough to learn to fill an entire book, way to much to try to explain it all here. Good luck!|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	Did you cycle the water before you put them in or was it water straight out of your tap and all you did was use the drops to get rid of the clorine?<br>  <br>  Also, do you have a water heater? They are tropical fish and will not survive in cold water.<br>  <br>  1 gallon is too small and within a few months by having a male and female together you will have tons of fry. I suggest getting either 2 females or 2 males instead next time and make sure you have at least a 5 gallon tank properly set up before you buy them if you want them to stay alive.|`|fySD5rboaa	temperture?<br>  food?<br>  desiesed [ might have been bought with one]<br>  some just dont live sorry|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	make sure your filter clean, and check the water for unwanted chemicals|`|7AWFPPWraa	because you keep ******* them
iVQULHqYaa	I have had sixteen dogs over the years and I used to get their shots every year. I stopped doing this when I read about the problems that this can cause, including death and chronic illness. I often think that pharmaceutical companies and vets perpetuate there use for monitory gain. However in the UK if is very rare for a dog to get heart worm or rabies and I am assuming that because you refer to shots that you are not in the UK. <br>  <br>  I use a homoeopathic preparation to prevent parvo, liprospirosis etc.<br>  <br>  I also object to the strong chemicals in preparations to prevent fleas, consequently I make my own. I use several "essential oil" which I mix with vinegar. My dogs have never had fleas and they have always mixed freely with other dogs.<br>  <br>  I have had several dogs who have become ill after giving them worming tablets, now I would only worm my dog if there was evidence of worms in her stools. I stopped doing this when a knowledgeable gentleman said "why give your dog worming tablets if she hasn't got worms".<br>  <br>  I think that shots for rabies are obligatory in some parts of the world. If I lived in a country where there were rabies and heart worms, I would have a dilemma. <br>  <br>  Incidently the cost of shots, flea preventatives and wormers has never been a problem.<br>  Now everyone will call me a crank. I will admit to this.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	1.  Many are of the opinion that they DON'T need shots every three years.  Some people never vaccinate, some people only give the "puppy" series, some follow a reduced schedule, and some continue to follow the old recommendations.  I personally give the puppy series, then my adults are done every 3 years, and my dogs over 10 are not done at all.<br>  <br>  2. The problem is that you don't know when the maternal antibodies wear off.  That's why the puppy shots are given in a series.  The maternal antibodies prevent the shots from being effective, so you want to give the shots late enough that they actually work.  However, if they wear off early then you have a young and vulnerable puppy that's unprotected, which is why you also give them earlier.  I do my pups at 8, 12 and 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  3. Theoretically, yes.  But puppies succumb more easily to disease than a healthy adult, so they do need some protection.<br>  <br>  There are many arguments for and against vaccinations.  I suggest you do a lot of research on the subject and come to the decision that is right for you and your dog(s).|`|n8jrLDblaa	Not exactly. <br>  <br>  Do most folks over-vaccinate their dogs? Absolutely. After maturity are there vaccinations that could be considered unnecessary? Yes, definately.<br>  <br>  But I am a strong believer that the DHLPPC series given to pups IS absolute necessity. There are so many viruses and parasites that pups are suceptable to...some can be contracted simply from being outside, drinking sitting water. Some can be transmitted to humans, and some (like Parvo) can kill in the blink of an eye. A pup is at risk to more than the adult dog. Therefore, vaccinate your pup.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	1) not all of their shots are every year.<br>  <br>  2) don't get them young and your dog could die from many different diseases and parasites that the vaccinations prevent.<br>  <br>  3) sure if you want your dog to die from something that could have been prevented with a $10.00 shot.|`|JsBb732Maa	The antibodies from their Mom only stay in their system a short while, after they have stopped nursing. It takes a shot a week to get in the puppies system so while the shot is getting where it needs to be the antibodies from Mom are wearing out. That's why you do a series so that the puppies have the protection of the shots before the milk antibodies are gone. Parvo and the dangerous diseases the shots protect them from are stronger than a dogs own immune system so they need the help to not have to fight these diseases. Some state laws are different, we have to get a rabies yearly but my daughter was living in Ohio and the rabies was good for three years but now that she home she'll have to do yearly again on her dog.I just get the shots so I don't have to worry about my dogs getting sick.|`|tXWvoYNfaa	Only a careless pet owner would NOT keep their pets up-to-date on their vaccinations. You can go to the Humane Society for less expensive shots.|`|1Is7u1wUaa	1. Well the vaccines don't last longer than a year so theres nothing you can do about that. Does that not explain your question? Not all human vaccines last longer either, it just depends on the disease being vaccinated, you can't change that.<br>  <br>  2. Yes they will still have antibodies from their mother but some of the diseases being vaccinated against are deadly! Just because they have their mothers antibodies doesn't mean they won't get a disease and because their immune systems arn't fully developed there is more of a chance of them becoming severely ill. You wouldn't like it if your puppy hadn't been vaccinated and caught a disease such as Leptospirosis and died.<br>  <br>  3. His immune system will still develop but the vaccinations are for diseases that are either fatal or highly contagious causing very severe symptoms that will leave your dog in pain and discomfort. Prevention is better than cure and a whole lot cheaper too. It is kinder to the dog as you are not letting it suffer if it was to become ill. I personally think it is completely irresponsible for an owner not to vaccinate their dogs. You are giving it a healthier life by vaccinating it and prolonging its life.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	Pups definately need shots the mothers immunties in her milk only stay with them a short while. I know somebody that didnt get their dogs shots and it came down with parvo when it was 1. Luckily it lived but there are SO many dogs that dont make it and it is a very deadly disease. You dont want your dog to come down with something, die, and then find out that it could have been prevented from a simple shot do you?<br>  <br>  EDIT: funny how everybody saying to get dogs vaccinated because its dangerous not to is getting rated down...must be a lot of irresponsible pet owners doing ratings|`|6SeWCfUfaa	This shows your lack of understanding of vaccinations and immune sytems.  I don't mean that mean, but it clear to me that you really do not understand how vaccinations and immune systems work.<br>  <br>  1.  Not all vaccinations are created equal.  Some are vaccinations that fool the dogs immune system into making antibodies against certain things and some are the actual antibodies.  How long these different methods will keep a dog (or person) covered depends on the type of the vaccine and the dogs (or persons) immune system.  Even with human vaccines - there are many that do not give us a lifetime immunity.  Tetanus is one of them.  So, shots every year because this is what they've determined the "shelf-life" of the vaccines to be in your dogs.  With research, they're finding that some of these vaccines last longer than that in some dogs, but they're also finding that yearly vaccinations are required in some dogs to keep them covered.  So, unless you want to have your doctor do titers every year to see how covered your pet is for different things, yearly makes the most sense.  Titers are expensive and the extra vaccines don't hurt the dog as much as catching the disease would.<br>  <br>  2.  Why so young??  As long as the pup is feeding on mama's milk, the pup is covered by mama's immune system.  But as soon as the pup stops nursing, that immunity starts to go away.  Now their own immune system is not fully perked up at this point so vaccinations are required and they're required every three weeks because, if you were to titer the pups, you'd see their immune response dropping off dramatically day by day after their first vaccinations until they are about 16-20 weeks old.<br>  <br>  3.  For your third point ... the only way for a dog to develop an immunity to something is to be exposed to it.  That's what vaccinations actually do, they fool the dogs system into thinking it's being attacked by this or that virus so their immune system will make antibodies against that virus or virus type.  If we allowed our dogs immune systems to develop naturally without the use of vaccination, most our dogs would probably die of parvo and distemper as puppies.<br>  <br>  Go do more research. Not on the doggy vaccinations.  But learn a few things about how immune systems actually work and the different types of vaccinations (such as killed virus vaccinations as opposed to attenuated virus).|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	1.  Most vets don't do annual vaccinations anymore.  Puppy vaccinations and boosters in my mind are an absolute must (anyone who has seen a puppy contract parvo knows this is awful) and rabies is the law.  But after the first year shots, most vets do shots on a 3-year cycle now.  I am now titering my dogs after age 7 except for rabies.<br>  <br>  2.  They need them so young because they have no protection from common diseases.  Their mother's immunity is not enough once they begin to be weaned.  Parvo kills thousands of puppies each year and it is pervasive in the environment and highly contagious.<br>  <br>  3.  No.  Again, many diseases are highly infectious and the puppy's own immune system has no chance against them.  Parvo is the most common. And no dog can fight a rabies infection - it is 100% fatal - and the shots are the law.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL DETAILS -  The last question is a good one for your vet.  I do know from talking to my vet that parvo in particular has different strains that have mutated over time that require repeated vaccination because the vaccinations change.  Rabies is used to be annual but was extended to 3 years in most places after more research confirmed it lasted at least that long.  They are particularly careful with rabies because of its implications in the human population.  Time of immunity varies from dog to dog which is why titering is a useful tool for vaccinations other than rabies.  And remember that tetanus in humans only lasts for about 10 years and many other types of vaccinations you get for travel for foreign countries only have limited lifespan.  They also now believe that the human smallpox vaccination does not confer lifetime immunity as they once thought.|`|FKqtAhjraa	I get my dog everything that is recommended. Because she cannot tell me if she is sick.  I'd never forgive myself if she was seriously sick or died because of my negligence.  And although I keep a close eye on her and she is mostly an indoor dog and we have a good fence around our yard, I think what if somehow we got separated.  If she were lost at least she would have that protection. I don't think a good immunity could guard against Rabies or those diseases and parasites.  And not all the shots are given every year.  It's on a schedule  just like human babies.  And they need them when they are young and more vulnerable.|`|ed511b455d00d21a007309cca49b2414aa	Veterinarians themselves have been debating these topics for years, and I think it's good you're raising these questions. They are good ones to ask!<br>  <br>  My family has had dogs for years, and never vaccinated them, and never had any problems. And this was in a rural area. We just kept them healthy, happy and fed with nutritious food and they lived long and productive lives.<br>  <br>  Ever wondered why we are now seeing so many pets with allergies and chronic disorders? Some studies have linked the onset of these to within 1-2 months of receiving shots.<br>  <br>  Even if shots could be proven safe and effective, there's NO reason why we should have to give them every single year.|`|stMcVPCMaa	I'll answer your questions in reverse order:<br>  <br>  3. Raising a healthy dog is certainly good, but just like people, being healthy and having a strong immune system is not going to protect your dog from all diseases.  There many diseases out there (distemper in particular) which are extremely virulent and the only defense after exposure is to have been previously vaccinated.<br>  <br>  2. They do still have antibodies from their mother, but they wear off over time.  The young age to start vaccines ensures they continue to maintain enough protection as the antibodies wear off.<br>  <br>  1. Some shots, rabies for example, are not needed every year.  They are coming out also with new formulas for other shots which are not needed so frequently.  I think even vaccines that are recommended yearly do probably give you immunity that lasts longer than a year, but again that immunity does decrease over time.<br>  <br>  I too dislike getting every single shot recommended, for reasons similar to your own.  However if you want to keep your dog healthy, you only have two options: 1. get the shots, or 2. keep him away from all other dogs and/or areas other dogs might have frequented.  I don't recommend option 2 because even if you always keep him at home and never walk him (not recommended for his mental health!), you can never predict when an emergency will require exposing him to other dogs.  So my suggestion would be to look for a vet who shares your concerns about overvaccinating, and can help you give your dog the minimum possible vaccines while still keeping him safe and healthy.|`|7Cis2pJEaa	Wow, this is actually a serious well thought out question on YA. Good job! I agree that in this day and age it is a good idea to question issues such as this. Some vaccines are needed, and others are required by law (such as rabies by 6months of age). Some vets have started to do blood tests to see if they have adequate antibodies before they vaccinate. Its called a titer. That way they don't usually need to do every one, every year. Also you can stagger them a few months apart, instead of getting them all at one time. That way if your dog has a reaction you can tell what shot it was, and avoid it in the future.  The key is to find a vet that will work with you, and not just guess on your own.<br>  They usually don't have that many antibodies from their mother. Plus how do you even trust the breeders to get the mom her shots at the correct time during her pregnancy. Few so called 'breeders' do.<br>  It is much better to raise a healthy dog with better immunities. Yet some diseases will kill your dog the first time they are exposed (such as the dreaded PARVO). Once again its important to have a vet that you trust. They will know which diseases in your area are more of a danger. <br>  My personal dogs get rabies every 3 years (min. required by law in my state). Since I get new fosters in I tend to vaccinate my dogs move often than I would like. And I board them when I went away, so they had bordello twice (the vaccine is only good for 4-8months). Except for the rabies its ultimately your choice.|`|AA12128656	1. not all shots are every year. some they only get once or twice. just like people. rabies they must get 1, then another in a year, then they are good for 3 years. this is to conform to laws regarding rabies vaccinations.  <br>  <br>  2. dogs do have antibodies from their mother, but there aren't antibodies to protect against, say, parvovirus. they get them early so that they will get the vaccine before they have the opportunity to come in contact with the diseases they are being vaccinated against!<br>  <br>  3. it's better to raise a healthy dog, but the dog must get the vaccines, because those diseases are ones that the dog wouldn't naturally be able to fight!<br>  that's like asking "can't my kids just get over polio naturally?"<br>  uh.... bad risk to take...

AQsiugSpaa	I am sorry your cat is not feeling well. A 17 year old cat is a senior citizen. <br>  <br>  Cats don't urinate outside their litter box unless there is a compelling reason for them to do that. She is telling you something. It may range from the box being too far away for her to get there in time, or that she has developed feline dementia and gets confused. She may be arthritic and getting in and out of the litter box may be difficult for her. She may have a bladder infection or stones/chrystals in her bladder which are painful. If you even had a bladder infection you would know how uncomfortable it is, with the constant urge to "go."<br>  <br>  She also may becoming deaf, hence the loud meows from upstairs, because she cannot hear her own voice. There are so many possibilities, it is impossible to list them.<br>  <br>  Your vet cannot put your cat to sleep without your permission. If it is an infection, your vet can give your cat the right antibiotics which will end that problem. It is rather straight forward. If her kidneys are failing, there are treatments that can keep her comfortable. But the only way to find out what is going on is to take her to the vet.<br>  <br>  I have had cats that have been in kidney failure and with treatment their lives were extended with good quality. I have had cats with bladder infections, and medications cleared it up quickly, along with a grain free diet.<br>  <br>  If it is Dementia, there are medications that your vet can give to delay the process and your vet can help you deal with this condition. <br>  <br>  Give your cat a chance to feel better, please. You have control over what your vet does.<br>  <br>  Sending get well wishes to your kitty<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Lots of experience with these issues|`|hetZz4c1aa	You already know the answer, she does need to see the vet.  A great deal can be done now for the older cats and it's very possible that she can have a much happier and comfortable life.<br>  <br>  But if she is suffering and unable to be helped, then euthanasia is often the last kindness you can give your cat.<br>  <br>  It's always hard, but always best to do what is right.<br>  <br>  good luck to you and your girl!|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	my cat is 21 years old and very healthy .he may have urinary tract infection he may need antibiotics.he may have mant more years.take it to the vet.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  I had this problem when my last 2 cat was at their senior years.  What I had done, was move the litter close to her food, or close to the front rug.  I was also afraid to take them to the VET, like you, did not want to hear the word.. they are old, and it is almost the time for them to go to cat heaven.  But I did went, learn how to care for senior cats, and did the best to give them the right food for their age, and medicine.  It is good to start feeding them senior cat food, and it is good to research how to care for them.  You will be grateful you did, as I ask that question everyday, after they where gone.  <br>  <br>  Also, they will not put your cat to sleep without your permission.|`|X8riDZBqaa	It's loss of bladder control due to age. Disciplining her would do nothing but make her unhappy.  Put pads or papers down, and keep her in one or two rooms of the house. <br>  The meowing could be she forgot where she is, or she's arthritic and it hurts to do stairs. It never hurts to see the vet.|`|zXGTDkZmaa	I would take her to the vet. They can't put her down without your permission. For now though maybe just put her in one room that doesnt have carpet about an hour after she eats ( the same room her litter pan is in ) and then bring her out to play every so often.|`|H3J6bN0Yaa	She needs to see a vet because she could be in pain. The vet won't put her to sleep without your permission and unless they don't think she is comfortable.

They won't put her down without your permission.  They'll tell you if it's the best thing or not.  I had an older cat, she was 20, that started doing that, and eventually she went into kidney failure.  We were able to treat it, and she lasted another year before it cropped up again, and I had to put her down then.  Take her to the vet, because it's not a pleasant death for them to go through kidney failure.  Might just be a matter of antibiotics and a special diet.  Good luck!|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Hello, my cat was 15 when she had this sort of problem, they tend to lose bladder and bowel control,i can understand why your brother is scared of her going to the vet,but is she happy? as for meowing loudly elderly cats do tend to do this, and can become quite clingy as they don't like to be alone,and crave company at this time in life,you say shes eating so it cant be a medical problem,but some cats do suffer dementia and can become distressed,and this can make them mess because they forget how to use the litter tray,you just have to be patient with her, and maybe remind her what the litter tray is for,by placing her in it when you think shes going to do something.|`|nY1nq9hCaa	Animals have an advantage over humans is that if they are suffering it can be ended peacefully and quietly.  My friends old cat was in a state and very old and a day came when she went down hill and the family cat had to be put down.  The environment we bring up these animals in are increasing there age expectancy but it does come to a point where it is becoming too much to struggle on.  <br>  <br>  Your brother has to learn the hard way that things die and there is a life cycle.  Your family are the carers you as a group must agree what is best and see if the cats life is effecting it and causing it pain.  <br>  <br>  I have experienced people hanging on to animals and it is more painful than just sorting it out there and then.  I have seen a dog kept alive from a natural death and it kept on having fits, banging its head unable to eat or do the toilet proper.<br>  <br>  It is time do what is best for the cat no matter how bad it will feel to the family.|`|ca94e42487ad3b3988db20bb798bce90aa	Take her to vet!  They wont put her sleep.  If they suggest that then you have to stand up and fight for yourself.  Be strong. :)  You love your cat, right?  You d have to pay a lot of money on her to stay well.|`|se27sAUwaa	Take your kitty to the Vet. It sounds like she is trying to tell you there's a problem. The Vet cannot euthanize without permission so tell your brother he doesn't need to be afraid. Delaying could be a life threatening choice though. She prob. has a UTI and needs meds.<br>  <br>  I had to put down my dog who was 10 because of medical issues, it was the hardest/saddest thing in my life. But it would have been worse to have him with me and see him suffer because of my selfishness. Do the right thing. Again she probably just needs some meds and love. Good luck!!|`|HCezdkNmaa	I had an elderly cat who did the same things as your describing, she had an over active thyroid and also was senile which is why she would meow, like she didn't know where she was. <br>  The best place for your cat is the vets.|`|AA10139925	I'm sorry that your brother won't take the cat to the vet. because when they start to soil in other areas of the house she is probably suffering from a form of kidney disease but the only way you will know is if she sees a veterinarian.  The fact is that at that age, they do have kidney issues and the food you feed her and the lack of treatment will only make it worse.  The only thing you can do is treat the underlying problem first and the urinating in strange spots will stop.  I think the rug will have to be gotten rid of because she has used it too often and it still has the scent in the rug no matter how much you clean it.  Otherwise the only recourse you have is to confine her to a smaller area near her litter box.  She should be treated and given a chance and an older cat usually has more issues with kidneys more than any other problem.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	take your cat to the vet and your want attention my cat does the same thing|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	Take her to the vet. It could possibly be something minor you could fix relatively inexpensively. If the cat is meowing she probably is in pain as you say, and to not care for this animal is cruel. If it does turn out to be that she has some incurable condition, then the only costs would be an office visit and having her euthanized.
AQsiugSpaa	I am sure that by now you have gleaned from most of the answers you have received, that responsible and caring cat people abhor this surgery and long for it to be banned in the US to join the other 25 countries in the world who have the decency and humanity to have made this surgery illegal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Had you done some research before you had your cat subjected to this unneccessarily cruel and inhumane practice about why cats scratch up the walls, you might have prevented the painful problem that your cat is experiencing right now.<br>  <br>  I do hope by now that you have taken your cat to your vet to have the bandages replaced correctly, to save your cat even more pain.

It's not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). <br>  <br>  Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run).

UIM8X38Oaa	A damaged eye can have some white specks or white cloudiness if there has been damage done to the eye.  Which is called clouding over.  I am not sure if that is what you mean or not.  But this condition usually settles in the bottom of the eye and eventually goes away.  If they is not blindness from damage they usually return to normal. <br>  <br>  I am not sure if that is what you are looking at or not.  I would have the vet look at the horse before your purchase it for sure.<br>  Good Luck,<br>  I hope this helps,<br>  Jenny|`|EaNjIhoQaa	I have a horse that's boarded at my barn that has the same thing.

ur5wDhkMaa	Erm, Jeffery Dahmer kept tropical fish.<br>  <br>  "It was nice, with African cichlids and tiger barbs in it and live plants, it was a beautifully kept fish tank, very clean. I used to like to just sit there and watch them swim around, basically. I used to enjoy the planning and the set-up, the filtration, read about how to keep the nitrate and ammonia down to safe levels and just the whole spectrum of fish-keeping interested me. I once saw some puffer fish in the store. It's a round fish, and the only ones I ever saw with both eyes in front, like a person's eyes, and they would come right up to the front of the glass and their eyes would be crystal blue, like a person's, real cute. It's a fun hobby. I really enjoyed that fish tank. It's something I really miss." <br>  <br>  He also ate his boyfriends and kept their skulls as trophies, he was not cool, he didn't have a Blue Crayfish.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16600068@N03/3258111752/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/16600068@N0...</a><br>  <br>  Crayfish are cool :o)|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I have both, what does that make me?|`|wnnudNp5aa	I'm impressed by people that have successful marine aquariums.

iXijnCxOaa	Responsible breeders know that some breeds are prone to squishing pups whether there is a "pig-rail" in the whelping box or not.  This issue is compounded when there is a large litter.  A responsible breeder would make sure the dam and pups were attended by a human 24 hours a day for the first couple of weeks~ until the pups are big enough to not get squished.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Just what Basset said, and also it helps to have a proper pig rail in the whelping box.

stMcVPCMaa	There's two main arguments against feeding human food to dogs:<br>  1. Dogs need a balanced diet and human food can disrupt that balance.<br>  2. If you add the human food to an already sufficient dog food diet, you'll end up with an overweight dog.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you MUST give your dog human food, I'd suggest the following guidelines:<br>  * Stick to foods the dog would likely find in nature if it was wild (meat, veggies) and avoid too many grains or anything processed as these are very unnatural for a dog.<br>  * Put the food in the dog's own bowl - don't let it eat from your plate.<br>  * Keep an eye on your dog's weight and adjust the level of all food intake to keep him/her healthy.<br>  * Be sure to avoid foods known to be toxic to dogs, such as grapes and onions.  You'll want to research carefully any vegetable you give.  I don't think any fruit except perhaps apples (no seeds) are a good idea.<br>  * Avoid flavored foods with lots of salt, gravies, etc.<br>  <br>  Your biggest danger is inadvertently feeding your dog something harmless to you but toxic to canines, and toxins can hide in surprising places.  I have even heard of dogs who died after eating what seemed innocuous food, so I think you are perhaps risking your dog's life to some extent by letting him 'clean your plate'.  Personally, I don't give my dog my uneaten food.  But I do occasionally feed them scraps of chicken or beef as I cook (before I add flavoring), cheese, or raw veggies like carrots or beans.  Raw eggs are also good for dogs once or twice a week.<br>  That being said, my dogs only get a bit (IE one or two bites) of 'human food' as treats maybe twice a week-enough to make me feel like I'm indulging them a little, but not so much that it's going to significantly alter the balance of their nutrition overall.<br>  <br>  Or if you really want to give your dog a meal he will love - try the "raw" diet.  I had mine on the raw diet for about a year and they LOVED it.  Had to stop only because my poor husband kept freaking out over all the germs he imagined were being left around the house because of it.  Personally I think if you follow normal recommended cleaning after handling raw food, you're just as safe as any other food these days.. consider recent contamination news on dog food, peanut butter, spinach..|`|AA12128656	nah i don't think so. i give my dogs table scrap every day with their rations. i just don't give them things that are bad for them. there's nothing wrong with some baked chicken or a bit of broccoli or rice!!<br>  <br>  on another hand- my pit bull b***h Dallas loves sweet potato- peels. she waits by the composter while i peel them...|`|n8jrLDblaa	Nothing wrong with a scrap now and then...as long as it's not something horrendously fatty, salty, sweet or one of the forbidden foods.<br>  <br>  However, many dogs regularly fed table scraps along with their food gain weight. The kibble you feed your dog has the proper balances of fat and calories. Adding to that with treats and scraps can lead to weight gain...and an extra 3 or 4 pounds is mofre taxing on a dog's body than you might think.|`|AA10229248	There's nothing wrong with it provided:<br>  <br>  Your dogs are also getting a balanced meal<br>  <br>  Your dogs are not getting too fat<br>  <br>  Your dogs are not allergic to anything<br>  <br>  You're only giving them small amounts of human food<br>  <br>  You're not giving your dogs foods that could harm them (grapes, onions, etc.)<br>  <br>  Your dogs are eating their regular food<br>  <br>  And most importantly:<br>  <br>  Your dogs are not begging for the food. Giving in to them only encourages the bad behavior.|`|6R9McFZhaa	what do you think about dogs in another poor country they eat any food and they are in good health,put the dog to choose between those balls and any food that you eat lol and you are going to see lol|`|YUQgyPT3aa	If you are feeding a good quality dog food AND human food...you will end up with a spoiled, fat dog.  <br>  <br>  People food = people<br>  Dog food = dogs|`|cpnT5Wqwaa	no, i dont think its that bad, as long as its not bad for them, like candy or sweets. <br>  <br>  ps. <br>  i do the same thing|`|IKq25y8faa	Not a good idea, once in a while you can treat them to something nice, but don't get them use to it.

They have killed three sets of boxers over a span of twenty years that way. All six dogs died of human-like  diseases. Don't listen to what others are telling you here. When a dog is free to look for its own food they get the nutrients they need but these dogs never had that option. Feed dogs dog food that satisfies their nutritional needs. An occasional treat is fine but a steady diet of the wrong stuff is a death sentence.|`|eRIge5D9aa	i think a lot of people do this...i know i do. as long as it's not harmful. last night i gave my dog some rice, just a teaspoon or so with no salt and some chicken with no bones or seasoning...and my dog loves green beans. it's not wrong as long as in moderation.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	not wrong but if it makes your dog obese he will not live as long as he would if he was a healthy weight.|`|CdGHyYDfaa	it is ok as long as you dont give them sweets or grapes for some reason grapes are harmful to dogs|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	no. but they really are not surpposed to eat human food|`|AA12090367	u shouldnt give them alot, but its not bad for them!|`|cSOwqXKxaa	Of course not!  Domestic animals ate real food for years before the invention of the dog biscuit and subsequent hard kibble 'pet' foods.<br>  <br>  I changed my diet last year as well and eat only real, unaltered foods.  This means no bleached ('enriched') flour, no altered fats/oils (hydrogenated or partially), no margarine, no MSG, no BHT, no artifical flavors or dyes, and as little chemicals as possible.  We quit eating all restaurant food (except for Panera, b/c we can get whole grain bread there).  I feel wonderful and have dropped 22 lbs and counting, and my husband has lost 63 lbs and counting, in only a few months.  We eat fresh, raw, and organic as much as possible, and truthfully we don't exercise like we did in the summertime, but the weight is still coming off!<br>  <br>  If you want the best possible diet for your dog, consider going raw.  Raw food is Nature's best diet, b/c nothing has been altered by cooking/freezing and still contain enzymes and nutrients.  This would mean feeding your dog primarily fresh, raw muscle and organ meats and raw, meaty bones, with minimal vegetables and fruits.  You will see a substantial difference in your dog's health on a real diet.<br>  <br>  I'm sure some of the other Y! Answers folks will inform you of raw food and prey model diets, and I'd definitely take a peek at what they suggest.  If you insist on feeding a commercial processed diet, however, at least pick something holistic or organic with minimal grains.  Anything else is generally junk, and the worst offenders (Purina, Pedigree, and store brands like Dad's, Alpo, Cesar, Kibbles n' Bits, etc.) use disabled/diseased/dying/dead meat sources, used kitchen grease from fast food restaurants, and Fido and Fluffy, freshly chemically melted at the shelter and still full of the sodium pentobarbital they were killed with, not to mention carcinogenic laboratory dyes and preservatives.  I am not joking - this is the truth of pet 'food's today.<br>  <br>  Just so information for you.  If you'd like to feed your dog real food, don't feed cooked bones of any kind and limit the processed foods, if you still eat them.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you!!  Good luck to you  : )<br>  <br>  EDIT - I didn't think about seasonings.  If you cook something in natural unbleached oil, like olive oil, or natural butter (not that Country Crock crap!) then that is fine as long as it doesn't make up a huge portion of the dish.  No pepper is necessary and minimal salt, if any at all.  Your dog may or may not like herbs, you'll have to experiment, but generally 'catch-all' seasonings, like those available from McCormick Spices for poultry or beef, may contain MSG, a definite no-no, so double check your labels.<br>  <br>  EDIT - The biggest poisons to canines are onions, grapes (and raisins) and chocolate, but there are other foods that may cause an stomach upset.  Steer clear of these and pits from fruits, alcohol, all nuts, green tomato parts, avacado, coffee, candy, and I'd avoid milk unless you have access to raw milk - the homogenization and pasteurization process alters the links between proteins, fats and sugars, making it harder to digest, and kills beneficial bacteria.|`|7IjGzvqTaa	Actually, for the most part, it's a very bad idea.<br>  <br>  Human food is very rich compared to dog food.  It has a lot of extra fats and nutrients that can be harmful to your dogs' health.  Cooked rice, would be your best bet out of what you've described, but if it is fed to them uncooked, then it can have the same effect as birds eating rice at a wedding ceremony; the dry rice absorbs liquids in the body and expands, causing discomfort and sometimes injury.  A little isn't terrible, but generally speaking, they don't become full until well after the point where it may become harmful to their digestive system.<br>  <br>  As far as the lamb and crackers go, as I said before, they're generally very rich in fats and such, which can be a prime cause of an overweight pet.  Crackers don't seem bad on their own, but they're often baked with high amounts of butter and seasoning; lamb on it's own is probably the lesser of two evils, but I still wouldn't suggest indulging them.|`|7l7as0siaa	Vets usually recommend against feeding your dog human foods.<br>  This is mostly because it messes with your dog's diet. Pet foods work hard to crate a recipe that gets the most nutrition to you pet so they can have the longest, healthiest, happiest life they can.<br>  Feeding your dog human food outside of this diet in your pet's food is extra, and if fed too much can mess with the balance of nutrients your dog receives.<br>  On that note, so long as it's in moderation and you are careful about what you are feeding your dog (no chicken bones, as they splinter and can cause internal damage to your dog, etc) you should be fine. Just don't overfeed the dog human food, otherwise it may not eat as much of it's dog food and upset its diet.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|cEerFO38aa	As long as it isn't spiced - IE: salt, sauce, pepper, etc. then it should be fine. If the food has any other ingredient on it other than just the meat (or natural fat already on it, not butter or olive oil), then I don't recommend giving it to them. It can disrupt their kidneys and liver, which can obviously lead to some bad medical problems.<br>  <br>  Their digestive systems are different than ours. They are supposed to be constantly on one diet - that's why when switching foods, they recommend doing it over a long period of time, otherwise the dog gets massive diarrhea (most of the time, I know some dogs who don't).|`|X2h9AU9Zaa	I see nothing wrong with it - and, yes, I'm guilty as well.  My animals eat a high quality kibble as well as people food on occasion.  I also have a cat who, while not as indiscriminate an eater as my dogs, enjoys a bite of ham or chicken now and then.  The cat also thinks mayo is a special treat!  I have always had pets and growing up poor there wasn't extra money for dog food so the animals ate whatever we didn't.  All of my animals have lived to be betwen 17 - 20 yrs old so apparently people food agreed with them.|`|c1334d7d6d160918eed9551c6f52e61baa	As long as they are eating their own food first,I personally do  not see a problem. It got to the point with us that our little silky was snubbing "his" food and wanting ours. It was cute at first but it wore thin quick.When our dog got sick the lamb and rice or ground beef and rice and chicken breast and rice is what our vet told us to prepare for our dog(all unseasoned).Their digestive systems are not like our(obviously) so that is why it is so important for them to eat their own food first.  All things considered you're fine.|`|YIWAefzUaa	It is fine, i have always done that with my own pets, how do you think wolves survive, they hunt, in other words they eat meat.

My Jack Russell Terrier LOVES to dig so I had to take a few steps to keep her in the yard.  She gets regular exercise to keep her energy level down, she is supervised 100% of the time when she's in the yard, and I have a place for her where she is allowed to dig to her heart's content (either a dirt area you don't care about or you can build a sandbox or something along those lines).  When she starts to dig in an area that's not allowed, such as in the lawn or against the fence, I stop her and bring her to her digging spot.  I play with her in digging games there so she'll be encouraged to dig where I want her to.<br>  <br>  This has worked very well, and after only a month of hard work she very rarely even tries to dig where I don't want her to anymore.|`|UmS6nhs7aa	cut their paws off. or blacktop your yard.

JiCKFTuIaa	The whole idea is to prevent dehydration, which is the mechanism that is fatal to the dog. Pedialyte works well.<br>  During recovery from any major illness the idea is to supply the dog with some extra building blocks (protein and fatty acids) to facilitate the replacement of cells damaged by the illness.|`|AA11097657	The diet of food is not important as a dog with Parvo will not eat.<br>  <br>  Fluids are the key to saving a dog with Parvo. <br>  As long as they don't dehydrate while they fight the infection they should make a recovery.<br>  <br>  I had a dog with Parvo and I bottle fed her water round the clock. As soon as she was well she had scrambled egg and light meals little and often for a day or two.|`|HwEdMNmraa	That's an interesting question. <br>  <br>  The old theory with Parvo was that dogs suffering from this disease should be starved and fluids provided intravenously only. New evidence is coming to light though that dogs will do better if you keep feeding them, even if they are still having vomiting and diarrhoea, as well as using the IV fluids of course. It seems that the few calories they can absorb will still increase the chances of survival and there may be some protective factor that prevents secondary bacterial infections from crossing the intestinal barrier.<br>  <br>  A study was performed recently where dogs with parvo were fed using naso-gastric tubes during the illness and they seem to have an increased chance of survival.<br>  <br>  In recovery the most important factor is providing a diet that is easily digested and absorbed, until the absorptive villi lining the small intestine can hopefully regrow.|`|vwC7klVVaa	If a dog has parvo it usually won't eat it is to ill the vet has to take care of all it needs with medicine and drips.

H06PtiIAaa	i kinda knew that you dont know about saltwater from your other question, listing all of that stuff.<br>  <br>  basically for the reef tank your going to need upgraded lighting, what did u think standard lightign was enough for corals and anemones?  You want to upgrade your lighting to metal halides with a pair pf power compact VHO actinic lighting. <br>  <br>  Along with the protien skimmer, for a reef tank you want to get some powerheads to create currents. i personally use hydor power heads but you can go with maxi jets with the sure flow modification kit.<br>  <br>  your going to want to have at least a 30-55 gallon sump aquarium under your reef tank for filtration and you can build in a refugium.<br>  <br>  Thats pretty much it for equipement, most is self explanitory.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Get as big as you can get.

s76aC4G8aa	Dogs don't hyperventillate, are you sure you're not confusing it with reverse sneezing?  My sisters dog will reverse sneeze uncontrollably when excited, we just have to calm her down for the reverse sneezing to stop.<br>  <br>  It sounds like they are sucking air a lot thru their nose and blowing it out in quick succession.  Reverse sneezing is normal, if she does it a lot and quickly then just calm her down.|`|QUxw60itaa	My Chihuahua reverse sneezes as well.

Ey1Mb4FAaa	First most of the answer you have here are a lot of sh1t, <br>  <br>  Soft wood like pine or Cedar causes respiratory infection, but aspen wood chips are fine as they are a hard wood! Wood chips don't get suck in there eye unless the gerbil is doing something stupid, (like you walking in a door). <br>  <br>  Never Ever use sawdust or any thing that said dust on it! as it causing respiratory infections as easy as soft woods, as well as cause damage to they eyes<br>  <br>  You can use paper as only as they is no ink and it unscented, but it starts to smell quickly.   <br>  <br>  Care fresh is good but i don't like it I have no reason other than price but there you are. <br>  <br>  Commercial nesting material looks soft and fluffy and perfect for a lovely nest, however it is very dangerous to gerbils. Gerbils can become entangled in it, amputating a foot.They can eat small amounts that may later cause a blockage. <br>  <br>  Sand become smell fast and it as the most dangerous of all bedding because if you get the wrong sand it can cause skin damage, the good sand is normally brakes the bank as they say.<br>  <br>  I breed gerbils and i use hard wood chips (aspen), with hay or barley on top, the wood will soak up the urine and the hay or/and barley make great nest! you can get barley and hay cheap if you look around mine around 2.5 for a small bag or 7.5 for big one that last about 20 tank changes<br>  <br>  I say forget want they like and pick the one that best for them!<br>  <br>  O and to the dopes that say bedding every thing here is a bedding you...|`|uDQmkdouaa	DO NOT use wood chips its very bad for every type of small animal. it can give them an upper respiratory infection. use bedding, its most obsorbant and very soft. (throw in some tissue too. just for cuddles)  Use carefresh bedding.|`|n7BuH75gaa	Hair. They like hair. Get an "It" doll for the cage.|`|FJbdpGfVaa	its best not to use wood chips for your gerbils as bits can get stuck in eyes. generally if you fill the tank about 1/5-1/4 full with sawdust then a bit of fluffy stuff on one corner, a bit of sand in another corner, a bit of jay-cloth-type-bedding all over then a little bit of hay (any type really, if its quite hard then squeeze it and trample it until its soft lol) and then lots of toys around and about. my gerbilslove it like that. its also a good idea to put a small pile of sand under the watter bottler for spillages.|`|CdGHyYDfaa	i think it would be best to have wood chips|`|SzGyWKsPaa	I would recommend aspen shavings, aspen pellets, or carefresh bedding for gerbils. I've used aspen shavings and carefresh for my gerbils, and I definitely prefer aspen. They do, too. Aspen is great for digging and tunneling in. It's absorbent, looks good, controls odor well, and is the safest wood shaving you can give to your gerbils. Stay away from cedar at all costs. Cedar is horrible for small animals. Pine isn't all that great, either. I wouldn't use it for my own gerbils, so I don't recommend it to anyone. There are people who use pine and say they haven't had any problems, but I, personally, wouldn't risk it.<br>  <br>  Chinchilla sand is good for bathing in, but sand isn't suitable for permanent bedding. Avoid the cotton-like bedding. The fibers can wrap around limbs, and if ingested, it can cause a blockage. <br>  <br>  I find that the top choice among gerbil owners I've talked to is aspen shavings. Try it out on your gerbils and see how they do on it.|`|TAGC3FNOaa	a bit of everything! they love burrowing in the sand, but if they live in a cage the wood shaving soak up the urine. and the hay is soft bedding for them to snuggle in.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would use wood chips so they can chew on them to file there teeth down. Sand I tried once and it gave my gerbils eye infections so I would stay away from sand. They like to chew on things so I prefer wood chips. I hope I helped You.|`|FVkyxQjqaa	bedding|`|OsCKbuYAaa	Bedding i would say.|`|VqEJk0eiaa	Gerbils... Cute!  I'm guessing they prefer wood chips..?|`|0QKEW5lRaa	bedding|`|9jNsEAFGaa	I wouldn't use the sand I've heard that the gerbils can inhale it. if u use soft chips cut in small pieces they will be happy too large pieces will cut their feet and be uncomfortable to burrow in. I would use the bedding because it is warm,soft,easy to burrow in and as a bonus it is easy to clean. Say hi to your gerbil 4 me!
n6ffS63Maa	The recommended guideline is as much as they will eat in 15 minutes.  And as an adult you should feed them every other day.  There's no set number to feed them and each leo will be different.  Normal mealworms aren't that big either so they'll consume larger numbers of those in a setting.  Mine can kill about a dozen giants at feeding time.  Feeding as much as they want every day is excessive and will lead to an overweight leo.  Not to say that what you are doing is excessive, but it could be.  Best to just stick with what's recommended.|`|wLgGD63raa	Is his tail fat, or is it a bit skinny? How much does he weigh? The answer to these questions may help a little more. <br>  <br>  If his tail is skinny, you should let him eat as many as he's going to. A healthy gecko has a fat tail, because that is where they store their fat.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, they're supposed to eat at least four (4) live food items a day.<br>  <br>  I leave a shallow bowl of mealworms in my Leo's tank. She does not try to eat more than she is capable of. If she is full or no longer hungry, she will leave them in there and come back to them when she is hungry again.

By this time the brain and body knows its going to pass on, and its shuts down all the pain reseptors, and all the things that make death painful. Those last moments were probably very peaceful for your bird, beleive it or not. The fact that you told your bird you loved her, and told her you cared, mattered a lot im sure. Shes probably flying free right now with all her birdy friends in Heaven with God.<br>  <br>  As I can tell you are a good parakeet owner, and Im sure you did everything you could do, bless your passed parakeet by getting another one that needs a home.

Y5DEupmraa	Don't do a 40...they get crammed. I have a 60 gallon tank that works wonders for my 7 year old. As for crickets, You can't really overfeed a dragon..Give as many crickets as they will eat in a 15-20 period of time. If one or two are left, you don't have to take them out, but if there are like 7 then take some out. If the dragon is just munching down all the crickets you have, Then either you arent feeding enough regularly OR you just have a hungry dragon. They will stop eating when theyre full, just like us!|`|JiUKeyhGaa	about 7 crickets if they r an inch long and get a 40 gal.|`|zBH33xb5aa	for the tank, at least a 40 gal, a little bigger is better though. i have two sisters and they went through a lot of crickets at 5 months, i still fed them crickets everyday but i was also getting them into the salads. i hand feed mine some of their greens to help get them started. check out this site, i found lots of good info here <a href="http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.co...</a>

TNf3UafJaa	Thats planaria, they developed because there's probably too much nutrients in your tank! you didn't have to do a complete water change, just change the water more often. 20% twice a week until they are gone. and you can wash the gravel in warm water and put it back in there. those wormies are nothing to freak out about (though i did when i first saw some in my tank). make sure you vacuum your gravel every time you make a partial water change. also, put aquarium salt in there (from the pet store), that can keep some parasites and diseases at bay.<br>  <br>  so they are gone now, right? make sure you change the water at least once a week (20%) and only feed as much as the fishies can eat within 2 to 5 minutes. you can even get one of those brine shrimp nets and fish out the left overs.<br>  <br>  try to avoid those complete water changes at any cost. even if you had some cycled water. the bacteria in you tank was just right for your fish and might sill have to adjust to them in the new water. thats more stress on the fish!<br>  <br>  so good luck getting rid of the planaria!|`|AA12155794	Mosquito larva.clean it properly and always change water and keep clean the tank.|`|d6vZ25Kcaa	i think u r tank has not been cleaned since months,if this happens white worms grow in d tank due to the old water content and if after changing d water worms aren`t dissappering the problem is with u r water plzzzzzzzzzzz change it other wise it will hARM U VEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYY...

I say this because the plastic cages are more sanitary (wood can absorb urine and feces), rodents will chew on wood and by the time you buy the materials and actually make it, you could have bought them a nice big plastic readymade one.<br>  <br>  The ones in the stores already have taken into account how much a guinea pig will try to escape, rounded corners, eliminated pinched body part perils, etc.<br>  <br>  Pet stores sell specific cages for guinea pigs and most are one level.

Rw7gi86Naa	They are domestic shorthair cats, one has a tortoise shell (aka tortie) pattern.<br>  <br>  So you don't get confused, terms like tortoise shell, tuxedo, calico and tabby are not breeds; they are words used to describe the color and pattern. <br>  <br>  More info:<br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	They are domestic short hair (DSH) or mixed breed cats, which is what 95% of what cats are. They are not specific breed - unless you probably got them from a breeder or rescue of purebred cats such as a Siamese for example. The one in the picture is tortoiseshell in color.  Torties are nearly always female (it takes a genetic mutation to get a male one).|`|cj31x3UMaa	Colors are not breeds, you have domestic short hairs. <br>  <br>  Tina, the tortie is beautifully marked.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Breeds don't just appear in kittens - they have to have parents that are a specific breed of cat.<br>  <br>  These kittens are no particular breedc - just like over 97% of the cats on this entire planet.  The mixed colour is referred to as "Tortie".<br>  <br>  I do hope you've gotten the parent cats spayed and neutered so you don't add more litters to the world.  With over 12 million dogs and cats put to death at shelters every year we really don't need any more mixed breed cats.  Please get these kittens spayed ASAP as well.  Don't wait till six months like some behind-the-times vets still do as kittens can reach sexual maturity as early as FOUR months.  They can be spayed and neutered as early as eight weeks as long as they're healthy and two pounds in weight.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	It looks like you have tortoiseshells and their probably american shorthair..and all females.

We all have many items and products in our homes that we never give a thought to.  That's because they are harmless to us and most other pets, yet can be deadly to birds in a very short period of time.  The non stick cookeware and the air fresheners already mentioned are indeed, two of the big bird killers.  However, there are many more.  There is a lot of information on the net about these dangers, plus you can find some good bird message boards to join and get information. But here are 3 links that will help you get started.

I've had several of my budgies and finches die suddenly, too.  Your cockatiel could have died from any number of things.  Respiratory illnesses are one of the most common causes of death in pet birds, but I don't know exactly what caused your cockatiel's death.  You can have a vet perform a necropsy if you really want to know why your cockatiel died.  Once again, sorry for your loss.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Unfortunately, pets mask illness very well sometimes, and with birds they always seem to be either very well, or immediately sick.

None of them are large fish, but just in case you want to consider them, consider this first:<br>  They are livebearers.  They have up to 80+ fry every 4 weeks (and that's each female you have).<br>  So if you even consider them, get only males, or you'll have an overcrowded tank with just one batch.  If you think of getting all females (even though males are much prettier), I'll warn you that chances are astronomical that any female you purchase will be pregnant, and will have fry every month up to 6 months without being around a male again.....then you have to think about the fry starting to reproduce at 2 months and above also.<br>  Evidently, these people haven't dealt with livebearers before!
AA10332192	Discus make lousy community tank partners.<br>  <br>  Why?  They are finicky.  They can be somewhat aggressive,  They are very intolerant of bad water and like a range of water that few other fish enjoy.<br>  <br>  Specifically your tank mates would not thrive with a Discus.  Either the tank is unhappy or the Discus or everyone.<br>  <br>  Guppies like a more basic pH and Discus a more acidic pH.  Bala sharks like a wide open tank with lots of swim space, Discus like a darker planted tank without open space.

But i might puke afterward since i had just ate a snake lol So i guess only if it was guaranteed after i ate the snake that i wouldn't puke! lol|`|5nFa6AW0aa	Puke for one week, puking not so bad live snake, it will haunt you for the rest of your life. And then you would puke for 2 weeks LOL|`|TFizPrvuaa	eww.. eat a snake|`|WQYsscIuaa	i would rather puke for a week, though i agree with daniel_walker_27.
jyGTlpzTaa	I have hear four acres for the first horse and two for each additional horse...but two would probably be OK. I guess there is no hard and fast rule. If it is very high quality grazing an acre per horse would probably suffice, but most grazing isnt that good.<br>  <br>  However, you will need more than an acre...pasture with horses kept on it gets "horse sick" and needs to be rested, so you need at least twice the amount you need to keep one horse. Also, horses are herd animals, its very unfair to keep them alone. You should consider getting a shetland pony or donkey to keep your horse company if not another horse.<br>  <br>  You will also need access to a stable for when the horse needs veterinary treatment and during the worst of the weather.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	You need 1 acre for your first horse, then an extra 1/2 acre for every horse after that.<br>  <br>  So...<br>  1 horse=1 acre<br>  2 horses= 1.5 acres<br>  3 horses=2 acres<br>  <br>  et cetera.  <br>  <br>  This is the minimum and most horses will be happier on more pasture.<br>  <br>  They also do better if you have 2 fields that you can rotate.  It is a bad idea to have just one horse because they are herd animals and they get lonely, so you need at least 2 horses.  It would be ok to get a horse and a pony, a horse and a donkey, a horse and a mule, or a horse and a mini-horse.  SOME but not all horses are ok with a goat, llama, or sheep as company but most aren't.  Very few horses can live by themselves and be happy.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	I had one acre for one horse, and while he had plenty of room to run around, the pasture was overgrazed and we had to buy more hay to make up for the lack of grass!<br>  <br>  My rule is 2 acres per horse!|`|Nuh3T1cDaa	The amount of land needed varies with the region in which you live and the zoning codes of your area plus how you plan to feed your horse.  <br>  The most restrictive code that I know of is 5 acres before you can have any livestock at all and then 2 acres for each additional horse.  The least restrictive is no zoning at all.  In some areas of the country it is common to keep as many as 10 horses per acre where in others an acre per horse is common.<br>  If you haven't much horse experience it's usually a great idea to keep your horse at a great boarding facility until you can learn all that's necessary to recognize problems and all that goes with keeping horses at home.|`|xlaPbuZpaa	Atleast an acre of pasture per horse.  But you also need to check  your local laws, because depending on where you live and what zone your house is in, you may not legally be allowed to have livestock on your property.  And I've also heard that some municipalities have a minimum acreage requirement if you own a horse.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	About an acre per horse.
ZDC81VjZaa	Have you by chance consulted with your local veterinarian?  It IS possible that your kitty may be suffering from chemical burns.  It is also possible your kitty may have ingested some as her natural reaction would to try to give herself a bath.  She's also a bit traumatized as first a bottle of smelly stuff fell on her and secondly, you gave her a bath.  She had a BAD day.  I would give yourself some piece of mind and call your vet.  That's what I recommend.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	give her another bath and us a tomato juice or vingar|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I don't know if can would like vinegar, try tomato sauce...<br>  <br>  Hope it was a great air freshener...|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Hmm thats a tough one.  It seems to me that your cat would be fine since you got the actual air freshener off her skin, and the smell is probably just strong and everlasting sort of like when a dog gets sprayed by a skunk.  I have found that Dawn dish soap does a pretty good job of removing grease or other messy things my cats have gotten into over the years.  Wildlife rescues use it on birds or other animals if they hurt in an oil spill.  They wash off oil with it, so I bet it would help your kitty and should be safe as well.  Try it.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Take her to the vet for a checkup to check her skin,and another thing watch in case she grooms herself, or she will swallow the stuff too, which can be toxic,so take her along without delay, to be on the safe side.|`|AA12387863	Try to rinse her thoroughly in vinegar. It will neutralize the smell and keep it from hurting her skin.|`|AA10139925	The only thing you could do was give her a bath and that should have taken care of the air freshener residue but that stuff is strong and concentrated and lasts a while because of the concentration of the fine powder.  You could try giving her another bath with the baby shampoo and eventually the smell will wear off.  As long as she didn't lick herself a lot after getting it on her and you bathed her quickly, then she will be fine.  If she starts to show signs of not eating, vomiting, etc. then take her to the vet.  She'll come around you eventually and she will forget the whole thing!|`|Lqf3BAImaa	Try baking soda. Sprinkle it liberally on the cat. Then brush it out after a bit. Hope this helps!
fYupEegGaa	That's good, I usually say about 5 pellets or flakes a day but what you are doing is fine. Twice a week you can also try feeding them freeze dried blood worms as treat.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Feeding them as much as they can eat in 5 minutes is a bad idea. That is way too much they will eat and eat and eat. They can probably eat 10 flakes or more in 1 minute. So you would definatly be overfeeding your betta. Bettas stomacks are only the size of there eyes.  Continue doing what you are doing. Remember you can feed them a few freeze dried blood worms a few times a week.<br>  <br>  Freeze Dried Blood Worms- <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/3315/Tetra-Blood-Worms-Freeze-Dried-Treat.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/3315/Tetra-...</a>|`|aAQ7UUTYaa	The way you're doing it is fine. The trick is never to feed him more than he can eat in five minutes.<br>  <br>  You can go to feeding him once a day, but betta's like to eat twice a day. So if you choose to only feed him once a day make sure you give him all he can eat in five minutes. <br>  <br>  Personally I think the way you are doing it is great.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	That's good :)  You never want to feed him more than what he can eat in 5 minutes.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	twice is day is good what ever he can in 5 minutes<br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish|`|JvTF7UrMaa	thats spot on to keep him in the best health just make sure thier is no left over food bits after 5 mins if so remove them lots of love zack x xx

6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Well, I am a firm believer in consistency and praise. I took all 3 of my dogs out every hour, believe it or not. I was not working during the summer and that is when I would always get my puppies, so I was home.The beagle, you see in my Avatar, was the worst. Still after almost 10 years, does not get it....lol! (Stubborn little buggar, but I love him.) My sheppie caught on in 2 weeks and was fully trained and my pointer about the same.  I used a little ( a VERY)piece of cheese , as a reward accompanied with lots of praise,every time they did their 'business' outside....that helped too.|`|AA10229248	With crate training, I've been able to housetrain every puppy and adult dog I've owned or fostered within 2 weeks. I did have on puppy that, even after 6 months, would still pee in his crate if I didn't take him out fast enough when I got home, but he was 100% reliable when loose in the house. That was more of a behavioral/power play thing than a house training issue.|`|AoLS7XXTaa	We just taught her that when she needs to go outside, she  lays down at the door very nicely. Try it! its eeasy and your doggie gets lots of treats.<br>  <br>  WE got the treat, and read her body movements, when she wiggles around and is all excited, thats a sign she needs to go out. Tell her "Wanna go outside?" and lead her to the door. THEN give her a treat =3. <br>  <br>  hope it works!|`|YV1bOajXaa	Pretty much right away for during the day.   We used a crate.  The nighttime potty breaks were grueling, but I suppose she was trained because she was|`|GT6396BDaa	It does depend on the age and breed of the dog, but the most important thing is to get them on a schedule right away.  Take them outside at the same times everyday, so the dog learns to know when it's time to go outside.  Also, put down newspaper or pee pads in an area they know in case they have an emergency or need to go and can't make it outside.  Dogs are smart, they seem to know what they are for, and if or when they go on the newspaper or pee pads, make sure you praise them.  Even praise or give them a treat when you take them outside and they go to the bathroom.  Positive reinforcement and a schedule are the main things to remember.  Be patient too.  An older dog may take longer to train if they are not already, but they will learn.<br>  I've house trained puppies and older dogs, and they all learned pretty fast, as long as they are kept on a schedule for going outside, newspaper or pee pads inside the house, a place where your dog frequents or stays and positive reinforcement so they know when they did the right thing.  All of my dogs were house trained within 2 weeks to a month.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|SUs4rN49aa	I would say it took 8 months to train my dog. We used positive reinforcement and patience! <br>  When he was just a puppy we'd take him out every 30 min to an hour. Every time before we were to go out, we'd say "Do you want to go out?" or "Do you need to pee?" Put him on the leash and then go outside. We'd go to the same spot everytime where he would do his thing. Then we would give him a treat. <br>  <br>  He would start to whine when he needed to go outside as he got bigger. And he would always look forward to his treat after he was done! We never punished him for making a mistake.. just cleaned up the mess and tried to catch on quicker next time. When we would leave the house, he would go in his crate, we'd take him outside before we left the house, and take him outside as soon as we got him. <br>  <br>  I think the key thing is to be patient and consistent. You can't punish a dog for peeing after it's already been done, he might not link the punishment to actually peeing on the floor because the moment has passed. If you keep at it though, you'll soon have a trained dog.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Both our dogs were adopted.  The one pictured was almost 2 years old and had been house trained.  So it only took a week or so to teach him how it was done in his new home/new yard.<br>  <br>  The other dog was a bit younger and had been a stray (clearly had no training prior to being picked up.)  It took us a little over a month until we stopped having accidents here and there.  We did use a crate with him, and that worked very well for more than just the potty training.|`|njxxUBjeaa	well my dog is a maltese, she was kind of a slow learner. it took about a year and a half to house train her. my mom trained her so i cant tell you how i did it, but then i taught her to come and i taught her, her name.

I did expect the training process to be slow because I wasn't at home 24/7 (although I was there for most of the time, don't worry I wasn't leaving her alone all day). She's pretty much house trained now, but she still has the odd accident and if I leave her when I go out, out of her crate she still goes. I do recommend crate training though, I didn't use this method from the beginning because I was a bit unsure about what I was supposed to be doing but once I got into it she started to learn pretty quickly!|`|hmjAwZQEaa	i have 3 dogs and the shortest period was 9 days the longest was about 2-2.5 weeks if i remember correctly but like you said it depends on the breed. old english mastiffs are quite easy to discipline just take your dog outside after every meal it has and it should not take long.<br>  <br>  all my dogs have come from good breeders so it is possible they were being trained before i purchased them|`|rGMv0AMtaa	Every dog we had learned within two months.  Don't wait until they have to go pee, or have an accident.  Take them out on a regular schedule like every hour or so.  Use words like potty, or outside, and associate them with what you are doing.  As they age by month, you can obviously wait longer periods before you take them out because their bladder grows, and they learn control.|`|0f644b00eccc311534ab8fe88a3eb455aa	this is a good question. with our new puppy, we got him in the end of december and he behaved completely well to commands by the middle/end of january. we usually, train our dogs by their way of being. this puppy was more calmer, and as a puppy easier. we had a clicker plus treats.<br>  with out old dog, we got him a little before he was 1 year, and he was very rowdy. hes training consisted of clicker, leash, treats and a stricter voice|`|io3lMQgFaa	Not too long at all...it's hard to tell exactly how long it took, but I can walk you through what I did.  <br>  Me and my boyfriend got a German Shepherd about 6 months ago.  We took him out VERY frequently, and whenever he would go to the bathroom we'd praise him; it helps to start saying the action when they do it (good boy go pee!).  Whenever he had an incident in the house, which he didn't really have many chances to, we'd say "no!" if we caught him in the moment and would immediately take him outside, but of course if you don't see him actually doing it, just clean it up and try to take him out more often until he gets it.  If you do find something after the fact, don't tell your dog "no", because some dogs would then keep going in the house and try to hide it from you.  Again if you catch him in the act it's fine to say "NO" and take him outside immediately, and if he does go anymore to the bathroom out there then praise him.  From what we've done with our German Shepherd, we quickly got to the point where we could take him out and say "go pee", he'd pee, and we say "good boy."   Good luck  :)|`|B1UcaukFaa	It was about a week for my 8 week old puppy.

There's something about the new situation that's upset your dog, and chances are it's because your dog is feeling neglected.

uBFhKXgHaa	Why on Earth would you want to?<br>  <br>  How about keeping your cats safely indoors? It'll be much healthier for your cats to be indoors where they're safe from poisons, loose dogs, other cats, cars, wild animals, malicious people... and so on (the list of dangers is quite long). Indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor or indoor/outdoor cats and it's very possible to have a happy, well entertained indoor cat. It's also entirely possible to train a cat to walk on a harness/leash for safe outdoor trips.

Your cats are used to the safety and temperature of your home. They have not gotten used to people, other animals and noises of cars etc. This could prove to be a disastrous transition. Keeping them in will guarantee a healthy life for your cats.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	You can't "make the change safely."<br>  <br>  Cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. More than 1 million outdoor cats are killed each year by dogs, traffic, and exposure to disease. In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|zpwJR60baa	HI, I am a cat behavior.  First do you have a nice garden to protect them from raccoon, and other animal in your area?  Let me give you a list, and if you think it is safe, then by all means do so.  There are nice big net you can buy for your cat, and attached to their cat door from harm.  Cat are happy indoor, and if you take time for playtime, they will be happy to stay in. Get a cat tree...<br>  <br>  1.  Check your area what local animal are out their.. like cougar, wolf, raccoon and doberman, pit bull (big dogs).  Check with your local animal shelter.<br>  2.  Make sure the vet had given the right vaccine to protect them outside, like FL-IV (feline leukemia shots) <br>  3.  Have them micro-chip in case they got lost in the neighborhood.<br>  4. Is your neighbor keep their garage door lock or open?  Cat can get in and get stuck in their door. <br>  5.  Are all your neighbor love cats or hate cats?  they can live poison out. <br>  <br>  Good luck.. and be safe for the cats..|`|hl4kkvXhaa	If they aren't used to being outdoors by themselves, this isn't a good idea.  Besides that, cats that have been raised indoors do not have the same immune system as cats that are outdoors all the time, which means they would be more susceptible to diseases.  Even if an outdoor cat's immune system is strong enough for the cat to show few symptoms, an indoor cat is more likely to get seriously ill or die.  I have a cat that got out after years of being an indoor cat.  She was exposed to a cat with what we thought was just a cold, so I didn't think too much of it.  That was four years ago, and my cat still has respiratory problems and leaking eyes!  The vet checked her and said she was exposed to a serious lung condition that react like colds to cats whose immune systems are used to it...so they just get a cold off and on...my cat has this for the rest of her life, and is now forced to endure disgusting tasting vitamins, minerals, and daily "blasts" of Primatene Mist just so that she can breathe comfortably.  The wheeze is still there, as the P.M. only eases the coughing, which seems to be very painful.<br>  <br>  If they have been declawed, they have no way of protecting themselves or to fight for themselves other than their back claws and teeth.  Yes, they help, but cats tend to fight with their front paws more instinctively.<br>  <br>  And, if your cats have had little exposure to an outside environment, they are more likely to be unable to care for themselves the way an outdoor cat would.  For instance, I have a friend whose cat got out in the winter one year.  Having never been outside on her own, she didn't know that crawling up inside a warm vehicle wasn't safe.  She got up inside (under the hood) of the neighbor's car to stay warm and fell asleep.  The neighbor didn't know she was there...and she died when he started the car the next morning.<br>  <br>  Plus, indoor cats are more likely to get hit by cars, not know how to fight to protect themselves, and are more likely to be attacked by dogs because they may not realize that a dog can be a threat.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to keep them inside.  If this is absolutely impossible, then you have to be unselfish and find them a another good home where they can be inside.  It's hard, I know, but cats are like children that way.  We are responsible for making sure that they are taken care of the way they need to be.|`|VHVkgzKmaa	Thank you for asking this question. I too am having the same thoughts, and have been thinking maybe it would be better to just let them stay indoor cats. Now that I see the other person's answer, I do agree that it would probably be best for us to keep our kitties inside! :)|`|QLWPvFmuaa	I am an indoor only person when it comes to my cats.  That said, the only safe way you can change your kitties to outdoor kitties is to build a secure, safe, sheltered area for them and keep it repaired as needed.  I would also recommend a cat door between their new shelter and the house, so they can transition on their own.  You will need to check local ordinances to be sure you are in compliance.  I have friends who enclosed their entire back yard and their cats love it.  They even have a tree to climb.  They can't get to the top, but can reach some lower branches, so they can lurk.  I live in an area where snow is a regular visitor, so my friends' cats are indoor/outdoor, which is good, because one of their cats hates (absolutely hates) being outdoors at all.  What are your plans if one of yours hates being outdoors?|`|vjrYFBK1aa	Is there a reason why you want them to be outdoor now?? <br>  I don't think there is a way you can make it safely. The best bet it to keep them inside where they are protected! If you let them outside you might not ever see them again...They could be eaten by a coyote, hit by a car, or they can even get into a cat fight. I just think it would be better if there kept inside. But, if you do choose to let them out make sure they are NOT declawed!!! If they are then they def should not be going outside. Goodluck with your kitties!|`|XgZbSsSNaa	What i did when i was doing this with my cat was...<br>  i took my cat out in the garden with a lead on , this may sound silly; but it worked! :) <br>  Then i slowly progressed, and took him out without the lead, but then took him in again when i went in. <br>  Then i let him out on his own, and he came back =]<br>  X|`|cj31x3UMaa	Nothing safe about it. <br>  <br>  Why not just give them away to someone who cares enough to keep them inside. They will live MUCH longer & healthier lives that way.
be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	First, you are doing better than you realize. If she doesn't go outside 30% of the time that means that she DOES go outside 70% of the time - excellent for a pup her age. Most dogs are not reliably housetrained until they are about 1 year old.<br>  <br>  Give her only about 10 minutes to eliminate when you go out. If she doesn't go she probably is too distracted or doesn't need to so bring her inside. Keep an eye on her (leash her to you or use a baby gate, if necessary) or put her in her crate. Take her out again in 20 - 30 minutes or when she shows signs of needing to relieve herself - circling, trying to go someplace "private," sniffing the floor intently, whining, etc.<br>  <br>  I agree with the first post. She can't understand to indicate that she needs to go outside until she fully understands that outdoors is the only place to eliminate. You can continue to use the bell but don't expect her to be asking to be let out yet.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	i recommend that you take long walks with the dog until<br>  she has to "give in" and pee. tedious, but most effective.<br>  this way she will learn that she must relieve herself before<br>  she may come in. the walks should be made in any kind<br>  of weather - get the dog used to rain.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You have to teach her one thing at a time.  Teach her to go outside, then teach her to ask to go out.  You're expecting her to put together two different concepts before she understands what those concepts are individually.<br>  <br>  Get her on a schedule where she's going outside often and having 0 accidents in the house before you continue to try to teach her the bell.<br>  <br>  Even if the older dog learned it that way, you have to remember that not all dogs learn the same.  Some need things to be broken down into steps further than others do.|`|9kTejB0uaa	The missing link here is allowing her back in when she's not gone (and there really isn't any point keeping her outside for that length of time if she's not going), and not crating her again.  If you do this, she can't go indoors, because she's in her crate.  Leave her in there for say 20 minutes and try again - outside.  Unfortunately for you, you are not there during the working day to get used to her body functions.  I mean when you know she has to go.  With my pup, I know she has to go say 10 minutes after she's eaten, as soon as she wakes up etc.  And I know that as she's now on 3 meals a day, she really only needs to pooh four times in a day (provided her stools are normal).  It's a case of getting in tune with what's going on.  At 5 months, you should have this licked really (probably don't need to tell you that).  But I think you do need to go back to basics with her because something's missing in the training.<br>  <br>  I don't know about ringing the bell - I don't remotely have a breed that it's been possible to train to do that but seems to me you need to be anticipating her need to go, more than waiting on her asking - even at this point.<br>  <br>  Try with the crate thing and get her out before she asks.|`|AA12128656	yeah, i'd put aside the bell training for now (just ring the bell before you go out) and train her where she should go first.<br>  <br>  a lot of people feel the need to train their dogs to tell them when to go, but i do not understand this because i tell my dogs when to go (they're on a schedule) and they never have accidents or tell me that they need to go. just remember she's going to need to go every 2 hours or so.<br>  <br>  don't ever give her the opportunity to go in the house. if she doesn't potty when you take her outside, then she needs to go back in the crate, not be running loose in the house!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It doesn't matter what your other cavie does, each puppy trains at their own pace.  The bladder isn't even grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  My cavie is taking much longer to train then my shelties do, it just depends on the puppy.  I am wondering if you are giving her too much space in the house for this age.  I take my puppies out to potty and I use my commands, and after they potty, then they get play time.  This tends to make them potty fast so they can play.  I don't want them thinking that they go potty and right back in the crate.  They go potty, and get praises and a treat, and play time and then they can go in the house.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.

When we've been away for a couple of days and come back our cat acts strange.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	It's how the tell us there's something wrong. <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or use a device that delivers a harmless static shock or that produces a loud noise when the cat comes near, to help redirect kitty to his litter box. Adding a room deodorizer with a scent the cat finds offensive - such as a strong citrus or floral - can also keep the cat away from the area. <br>  <br>  When to See the Vet <br>  If your cat continues to eliminate outside of the litter box, a trip to the vet is in order to check for health problems. No behavior techniques will help a cat with a problem that requires the attention of a veterinarian. <br>  Urinary tract|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Well, the first thing to do is to have the cat checked out by a vet to make sure it's not a physical problem.  Cats often begin using other sections of the house as their personal litter pan if there is a medical problem.  Worms, Urinary Tract Infection, and other disorders can cause this.<br>  <br>  Do you have enough access to the litter pans?  Some cats are very particular about litter pans, and if they aren't being cleaned frequently enough, they will find another place to go.  Usually, if you have more than two cats, you want a second litter pan.  I had a cat one time that was fine with his mate sharing a litter pan, but when another cat I had used the pan, he would absolutely refuse to use it.  I also had a cat that had a strong aversion to clay litter.  He would only use the clumping kind that was like sand.  If I had to use clay for any reason, he would hover over the pan, a paw on each corner, to "do his business", and not cover it because he couldn't stand the texture touching his paws.  So, this could be another reason, if you have changed litters.<br>  <br>  But, most likely, if he's not getting your attention and your husband is hardly home, you have a problem.  Yes, they will act out like this.  He needs your attention, even if you don't like him much because, like a child, he's feeling lonely.  Think of it this way:  If these were human children, would you pick favorites?  Would you ignore one child and give love and affection to the others?  That's not very fair to the middle "guy".<br>  <br>  Sometimes we just have to deal with it.  I can't stand my daughter's kitten, but I don't treat him like an outcast.  Now that she's in school, he's lonely, and I know this, so I make sure to give him attention and let him sit with me.  I make time to spend with him, even though I don't care for him.  He's actually fairly content, and is less destructive than he was right after school started.  So...you have to find a way to make him feel wanted, even if you don't really like him much.
SOxdyWQOaa	well if it means that you don't want her any more yes you should|`|zBH33xb5aa	well usually when people don't enjoy their pet it doesn't get proper care, so i would probably find it a new home. i love my corn, she is quite active and i like watching her climb around in her tank. she is handled often and quite friendly. your snake is 5 i don't see what's so hard about caring for her, at this age you can feed her every two weeks, clean up after her every two weeks. i would regret getting rid of mine. try getting more stuff for her to climb on in the tank to make that more interesting.|`|i5AsfCuJaa	cats suck if anything get rid of them but if you don't think you can take proper care of your animal then please sell him and don't send him to a shelter or anything|`|MgJvDbUcaa	definatley find her a good home and i would personaly say never buy another reptile in you life<br>  NOT FAIR TO ABANDON PETS <br>  DON'T BUY IT IF YOU WILL NOT KEEP IT A LIFE TIME|`|KsMLHzbzaa	KEEP IT.....THEY ARE EASY TO TAKE CARE OF. WHAT IF YOUR PARENTS DID THAT TO YOU.|`|uTIoOa62aa	no
oDVx7nSxaa	No - no issues at all.  I have an extremely cross-eyed lynx point Siamese, and the only "issue" we have with him is he's clumsy.  I believe his depth-perception is affected.  Other than that, there is nothing wrong with his eyes, and there is nothing special you need to do/worry about.  Some cats even have a "jiggling" associated with their crossed eyes, but again, it's not a health issue.|`|cj31x3UMaa	no, although I have only produced 1 cross-eyed cat in over 36 years... it lived a long & happy life.<br>  <br>  I have also known blind cats (w/ their own guide cats) that lived happy lives.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	My Siamese mix Sam is cross-eyed as they come.  He's about 3 years old and I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary about him.  The cross-eyedness is a genetic defect but as long your kitty is otherwise healthy, I wouldn't worry.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	It probably will not affect him too much - mainly its a persection or distance thing where he could mis-calculate when jumping.  Do not let him outside unless under supervision.<br>  <br>  I doubt it would lead to any blindness.
teDI6RQ8aa	You are 23 now, married.  This happened when you were 10.  You said your mom blew your dog's minor issues(so you said), out of proportion, and now say your current dog is ill and are having a hard time all around.  Which is it?  Is the dog really ill, or is your mom blowing it out of proportion?<br>  <br>  Stop dealing with this, and let it go.  Judging by the umpteen other questions about this, I think you want us to blame your parents for this.  I refuse to blame them.  They did what they thought best, which was to protect the family from injury.  I refuse to blame parents for that, especially when the dog won't allow them to discipline their child for talking back.  The kids' safetey comes long before any dog.<br>  Edit: "One day I back talked at my mom (this was the day) and she spanked me and that is when he turned on her and went at her. He didn't bite her but he showed his teeth and growled at her until she stepped away from me"<br>  <br>  No dog should EVER have that kind of power over a parent.<br>  <br>  Edit: "|`|AA12235978	It's normal for dogs to try to protect their owner.  It isn't your fault, that's just how dogs are.  They are wonderful animals.  When Pongo felt that you were in danger, he took action to protect you.|`|aCqSF87Raa	The most probable reason for his behavior was the previous abuse, lack of socialization/training (which would have been your parents responsibility at that time), and possibly genetics. <br>  <br>  I doubt your behavior had anything to do with it. You were a kid, kids do things. It's up to the parent to control those situations (maybe yelling and spanking weren't the best and COULD have contributed to any possession aggression in the dog... but heck, you should see what goes on in MY house and I'M 20 years old!) and train/socialize the dog so the dog doesn't become aggressive.<br>  <br>  When people approached you he could have been protecting you or he could have been possessive aggressive of you and your sister. I've seen it, and it isn't pretty - it's something that would have had to been dealt with immediately with the help of a trainer. Without a trainer or behaviorist, the behavior would have gotten worse.<br>  <br>  When those dogs charged into your yard he could have been protecting you or he could have been territorial aggressive. Which is a VERY natural behavior for a dog. Most dogs WOULD charge unfamiliar and poorly mannered dogs that popped out of no where.<br>  <br>  As for your cousins... well any dog would become aggressive in that situation, and it was up to the supervising ADULT (not you) to prevent those sorts of things. <br>  <br>  So i wouldn't blame yourself. You were doing what kids do best - disagree with the parents. ^_^ That alone has no effect on a dog's behavior beyond maybe causing some stress and tension. But in general a behavior is more deeply rooted: either genetics, lack of proper training and socialization, and/or constant repetition of a behavior without any correction.|`|AA11244754	No honey, it was not your fault,  Your dog being protective of a child is NEVER the child's fault.  He just didn't understand why your mother spanked you, all he knew is that she was hurting you and as far as he was concerned it was his job to protect you, also not cleaning your room is not the reason why your folks got rid if him, you were just being a kid.  When your friend pushed you he was again protecting you from potential harm and the nip that he give your friend was just a warning that she was going wrong.  As far as the dogs coming into your yard and treatening to harm you, dogs are very, VERY territorial and that is why he chased and bit the other dogs off with your dad's help, he was protecting you!  As for your cousins, they deserved to be bitten because dogs DON'T like to have their tails pulled (especially if they were abused previously) and they were harming you.  But none of what happened was your fault.  Sometimes due to being abused dogs become protective (I am also assuming that the same abusive owner he had may have been abusive a female child of his too so that is why he was so very protective of you, he wasn't going to let it happen again).  J|`|KmC0K59taa	This was not your fault.  Sounds like your family couldn't handle the dog.  It's hard when the dog has a seizure disorder.  It's like a special needs child.  Someone with the proper training need to raise the dog.  <br>  <br>  If it's been 13 years, let it go.  You are only torturing yourself.  Be happy and think positive thoughts!|`|L22hVXTIaa	First off, quit blaming yourself - you were a little kid and little kids have no control over certain things.  It sounds to me as if the dog acted fairly appropriately given the circumstances and given the fact that it appears he was locked in a crate quite a bit.  Obviously, he would have benefited from some training (again, you had no control over that) and your parents should have done right by this dog and worked with him.  A little positive discipline and that dog would have been fine.  Also, it sounds as though your home may have been a little dysfunctional what with your Dad and Mom yelling all the time.  And, that is not the best environment for a dog or a kid.  I'm sorry your parents gave him up rather than spend some time trying to make him a better pet, but it's a story that happens all too often.  Now, quit beating yourself up - you were a kid!|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Hey, Its not your fault. Dogs are pack animals and protect their pack - so Pongo must have seen you as one of his pack, and if someone is acting aggressivly to you then Pongo would protect you. <br>  Dont worry about it, whats done is done. <br>  ?|`|NjcV19f3aa	no im sure its not your fault, my parents also sent my dog Bella away because she was kinda blind and dug through my neighbor's fence and ate their chickens, i was devastated but then i realized that it was better than putting her to sleep so don't worry its not ur fault|`|Zv7aPjcQaa	It is NOT your fault! your dog LOVED you very much. A dog who stands up for you and would put his life in danger before yours, loves you. I am assuming you spent the most time with him and gave him the most attention and love...correct? if so, he knew you as his master and didn't want no one harming you. I'm pretty sure he felt the same way you do now. He KNEW when you were in trouble or when you were sad and so he stood up for you. I'm pretty sure he knew the one hitting you was your Mother, and that is why he only growled...he was warning her because he didn't want to bite her. Trust me, he would have bit her instantly if he wanted to. Again, it is NOT your fault. I don't think it had anything to do with his passed abuse...he just loved you and wanted to protect you. I'm also assuming you were young at the time, or probably the youngest..he probably thought that you were the most weakest in your home and felt that he needed to stand by you or he felt that it was his job to make sure you were never hurt. Your best friend was doing you a huge favor and I just wished you still had him. He was so good to you. All you would have to do was keep him on a leash in public and keep him away from people he may bite and for the people that were pulling his tail etc...that is TORMENTING the dog and I would bite those people too. Dog or not. You need to stop blaming yourself and just remember how much you loved your dog. I am sorry your new dog is sick...I hope he gets well soon. Thank you for sharing the picture...he was really cute and I am sure you loved him. Have a pleasant day.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	EDITED At 10 you were a child.. therefore not responsible.<br>  Your parents should have taken a stronger hand in the dogs training. <br>  But ultimately not your fault, the dog loved you but did not have the training he needed to know he was NOT responsible for your protection, this should have been provided by an Adult|`|kvHqnR5Haa	This was in no way your fault.  It sounds like your parents weren't exactly the kind that would properly train a dog.  They obviously didn't put in the time it takes to train him to be a good pet.  So don't blame yourself, he was just protecting you from things that he thought would bring you harm!|`|mL0BjDQWaa	It isn't your fault but some dogs are over protective to children. Which isn't the dogs fault ever, when i was younger my grandparents had a English bull terrier and i love it to bits but if anyone went near me it went for them, one day my grandad was messing around and shouting near me and he went for him and bit a chunk out of his hand. So the dog got re homed :( and i feel like its my fault but apparently its not my fault, It was best for him to be re homed because other wise he would have become distressed and could seriously have hurt someone. <br>  Sorry this probably doesn't make much sense but i hope it helps :)
DfiHyjcLaa	She's an irresponsible dog owner.  Everyone should pick up after their dog...its simple common courtesy.<br>  <br>  I had a neighbor that would allow their dog to poop in my front yard every time he took the dog for a walk.  He never picked it up.  One day I saw which house he lived in and the next time the dog pooped in my yard, I picked it up in a baggie, took it to his house and left it on the front porch with a note that said "you left this in my yard, thought you might want it back."<br>  <br>  It was a day later that I did it, and I don't know if he knew it was me, but he picked up the poop after that!|`|11PAFD9Caa	People should pick up their dogs crap.

You have every right to be angry.|`|cnZlMojUaa	My answer is typically, "Oh, I see you forgot your poop bag. Let me get you one." I typically have poo bags in my pockets, so I can instantly hand one off. I've never had someone I've given a bag to refuse to pick up if I am standing there.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are always the people you don't see....<br>  <br>  I feel picking up after your pets is a part of being a responsible dog owner. I hate walking my dog and trying to dodge piles. So yes, the person who allowed the dog to go in your garden and not pick it up was in the wrong. Saying you will tell the dog not to go? Sorry, that doesn't cut it. A dog will do it's bodily functions and the owner does have the ability to control where these happen in almost all cases.|`|AA12128656	pick it up with your little bag and hand it to her, tell her it's hers to take, and if you catch her not picking it up again, you'll report her to the health department or the town or whoever in your area is responsible for that. then give her a lecture about zoonoses.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I am not sure what the laws are where you live, but I had the same problem with a nasty neighbor.

It's weird. At first I thought it had to do with the coldness of the water. See before we adopted her she had been found on the streets at about 5-6 months in -40 C temps. And I've noticed that whenever she comes into contact with anything cold - air, water, even if I pet her with cold hands - she shakes her paws. I noticed this shaking and wiping action when she drank water so I just chocked it up to associating anything cold with her experiences in her first few months. But she now does when I give her room temp water. So you're guess is as good as mine.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	This behavior is called "milk-treading." When you relax and sit quietly, you're giving your cat the same signal he got from his mother when he was a kitten - that his mother was ready to let him suckle.  A nursing kitten instinctively uses his paws to draw out the milk, gently pushing on his mother's stomach to increase the milk flow.  When older cats behave this way, it's a good sign that they're happy, content, and probably recalling their kitten hood.|`|AA10936767	Think of it like this.

uBFhKXgHaa	Kitties in heat do a lot of odd things. Make sure you get her in for a spay ASAP.<br>  <br>  Fixing your female has a lot of health benefits as well as ensuring that they won't add to the pet overpopulation. Spaying before the first heat cycle is highly recommended and healthiest in females as it reduces the chances of mammary gland cancer later in life to near zero, but even spaying afterwards has a lot of health benefits. Spaying eliminates the chances of uterine and ovarian cancer as well as eliminating the chances of pyometra (a deadly uterine infection). Every heat cycle a female goes through increases her chances of developing mammary, ovarian, or uterine cancer later in life as well as putting her at risk for developing pyometra.

oDVx7nSxaa	The main culprit for the coughing/wheezing is asthma, but it could also be heartworm, or cardiac issues. Could also be bronchitis or pneumonia.   Expect the vet to do some basic bloodwork, and take a chest x-ray.  This will help them diagnose asthma.  If it is asthma, the usual course of treatment starts with a steroid like prednisone, which is really pretty cheap (especially if you get a prescription from the vet and call around to the drug stores to get a good price on it).  If it's bronchitis or something like that (which the x-rays will show as well) they'll get antibiotics for it - expect to pay $12-25 for those.  Heart problems and heartworm are possible of course, but those are much more rare.  <br>  <br>  I have a cat with asthma, and he is doing well - there is an allergy component to his problem and once we got the initial inflammation under control, he doesn't even need daily medications. He's a rescue, and had a very nasty bronchial infection which certainly did not help.  We're lucky - and maybe you will be too.  You've taken the right step by getting him to the vet though.  Good luck.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	They may have a chest infection, as my cat had symptoms like this once, and she was given antibiotics,but they didn't do anything, so she was given a different kind and she was ok after,i know its scary to see them wheeze, it makes you panic! but im sure they will be fine after a visit to the vet! good luck.|`|AA11215737	That tongue action there is what a cat does in reaction to intense internal pain.  The grunts only add to my suspicion.  See your vet.  No one can make a proper diagnosis over the internet.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Cat might have swallowed something & have it stuck in throat.<br>  <br>  no nasal or eye discharge (even clear) would seem to rule out a URI... allergy would be a LITTLE more likely<br>  <br>  I had a cat years ago that was wheezing badly, we gave it oxygen & it perked up. No oxygen & it was sitting back up straining to breath... turned up to be wet FIP in chest cavity putting pressure on lungs & heart.<br>  <br>  Explain up front to the vet what your financial situation is. Some just go off & try anything/everything measures, others take time to consider what is the most likely problem w/out trying to drain your bank account.<br>  <br>  Good luck & let us know how your cats are doing!
gU34xa9vaa	Yes report them ! Tell your vet all about it tomorrow and ask his advice who to tell. Cats shouldn't be kept in those conditions and if yours has some eye troubles, the rest of those poor cats probably have too.|`|10eguzBCaa	yes please report them these animals are living in poor condtions and it isnt fair|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	I would report it. They must not know how bad the conditions are their. I would ask them to check it out. If they are not going to take care of the cats, then the cats needs to be removed. I wonder if the foster parents gets paid to take care of the cats? If so, then I think they need to close it down there.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	I would report it.  Not only is that horrible for the cats, Its a public health hazard.  Call your local police/humane societies and get their advice as to whom you should report it to.  You would be doing the right thing.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	Please do!!!!!|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Definitely!  It could be that the agency isn't keeping up with visiting the foster homes lately, but they should at least know how small the house is so that it can be determined how many cats should be there (though I have never seen a home that could house 30 cats that way!).<br>  <br>  Housing all those cats isn't healthy for them, and she's running the risk of spreading diseases between all those cats.  Also, it's not healthy for the woman who is actually living in that filth to be breathing in cat urine, feces, and pet dander...<br>  <br>  In other words, reporting her will get the cats out of that situation, and hopefully help her out too.  It sounds to me as if she may be a cat hoarder, and this could be loneliness or an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  Either way, the report will also hopefully get her the help she needs.|`|ptNy4uicaa	It sounds like the place has good intentions, but sounds like it is being run incorrectly. <br>  <br>  I would report them, if the SPCA or other agency thinks it is running fine then they wont close them down, but it would be in the animals best interest if you did report them, just to ensure they are being cared for properly!. <br>  <br>  If you cats eyes are watery and gooey, it is probably a upper respiratory infection, that is highly contagious  to other cats. He will need antibiotics from the vet.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|i6KUtPXXaa	yes, most definitely. there is no way a cat should live like that let alone about 30. call animal control and let them take care of them and put them in deserving homes. It's also definitely a good thing you are bringing yours to the vet. I can't believe all those unloving hearts out there that could make and animal go through that sort of thing. So thank you!|`|4pQdvWtZaa	you should defo report this person to your local SPCA or RSPCA  shelter and then YOUR POLICE because the animals can be saved first. Then the police can take her to prison, did you take any photos of the living conditions.. they could be used as evidence at court AS WELL AS bringing your kitty with u.<br>  <br>  Hope u have a great new life with your lovely cat though..x|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Definitely report the guy. You'll be doing all those cats a favour, even if half of them have to be put to sleep. You do get some odd people who think they are 'rescuing' cats when they haven't got a clue how to look after them. Or it could be a kitten farm.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	yes report them<br>  that isnt right and get your cat checked out asap he could have allsorts of stuff wrong...  <br>  i feel so sorry for those other cats what company did you go with?<br>  you should report them...<br>  ive never been to a rescur place like that|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Absolutely report this person.  This is not a legitimate rescue but a hoarder.  Call animal control and have them investigate the situation.|`|m7m9Xu24aa	She deserves to be lit on fire and pushed into a garbage can!|`|rgA4jIsyaa	absolutely, to animal control and the health department|`|fFvXahMUaa	Yes, report the person. When you go to the vet tomorrow tell him the state the cat was in. Also ask questions like how old is the cat and has he any diseases or illnesses. In the evening, try to put him into bed before his eyes go weird or he acts like he needs more food. Good luck with your new cat!|`|se27sAUwaa	Uhhm... yeah. That does not sound good. I would put a call in to have Animal Care & Control or someone take a looksie. If everything is ok then no harm no foul. I've seen stuff like this on that Animal Police show... makes my toes curl. Please call.   And thanks for adopting!! I just rescued two kitties myself (one sick), doesn't it make you feel good??|`|Iqh7U5Ypaa	Yes. You must report this person to the RSPCA. <br>  Animals cannot live like that, it's animal cruelty and it must be stopped. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rspca.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  check their website to see what you can do.|`|3D4aPR18aa	I would absolutely report them.  The cats are obviously not properly cared for.  I rescued a farm cat with discharge from its eyes and it required antibiotics.  These cats can die.|`|cj31x3UMaa	YES! Include copy of your vet report when you call & report conditions.<br>  <br>  Good luck w/ your baby, hope that he is OK.|`|AqDEQUqLaa	Hello, I'm sorry to hear about this problem. Yes you should most definitely report the owner of these cats. They deserve better living conditions and shouldn't be treated like that. It is a good thing your bringing the kitten to the vet because something funky is definitely going on with it. If it is not eating i suggest giving it a bowl with just a little bit of milk (remember just a tiny bit) and some small pieces of soft bread. They are naturally attracted to the milk and if the bread tastes like it they will usually eat it too. Try to show it as much affection as possible and don't try to corner it or put it somewhere in a small area. Let it explore even if it is shy, but keep a close eye on the cat until you bring it for an exam.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and bless you for helping this kitten.
zzzd9tC4aa	In a plastic/glass vivarium, heat mats should go outside the cage and the heat will be emiited through the vivarium walls. If placed inside the vivarium under some sand or substrate, your animal may scrape away the substrate and burn itself.<br>         Wood does not conduct heat very well so putting a heat mat outside the wooden vivarium would be a bad idea. Therefore you would have to put the heat mat inside- as said before this could harm your animal. So a better idea would be to put your heat mat on the side of the vivarium, but this could still potentially burn your animal. <br>            So in your case I would suggest a heat bulb be placed at one end of your cage and have a piece of stone or slate positioned beneath this-it will heat up and essentially form a hot rock(like a heat mat). Put an ordinary wooden shelter at the heat end(as well as the non-heat end) and this will trap some heat and so your snake will have a "warm shelter".<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out a bit. If all this fails,you can just buy a glass vivarium and put a heat mat underneath!|`|nvpnzyCGaa	Even though the heat mat is often put underneath the cage, do not do this animals that like to dig or burrow as they will burrow to cool themselves down and it will get hotter. If in doubt or have a non burrowing animal simply attach it to the side as this will be a bit more natural, creating a cool and a hot side so that the animal can decide where it would like to go. Snakes do not burrow but it may prefer the heat from one side rather than beneath.|`|UZYT8eMwaa	The heat pad should heat though fine, it does for me. You could actually do either/ or. Both work if setup with a good thermostat.  <br>  Here is a pic of some of my cages.<br>  <a href="http://i463.photobucket.com/albums/qq354/minguss_photos/HPIM2347.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i463.photobucket.com/albums/qq354...</a><br>  I don't know how your cage is built but if you need to put the heat mat inside you can drill a small hole for the cord like this. Then silicone the hole.<br>  <a href="http://i463.photobucket.com/albums/qq354/minguss_photos/HPIM2262-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i463.photobucket.com/albums/qq354...</a><br>  <a href="http://i463.photobucket.com/albums/qq354/minguss_photos/HPIM2259.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i463.photobucket.com/albums/qq354...</a>|`|q9HCPFWDaa	heat mats go inside vivariums with reptiles and underneath for insects and tarantulas and stuff.|`|Fi1kC8zgaa	Because the vivarium is made of wood, i would suggest that you put it inside the vivarium, as the thickness of the wood is about 3/4 of an inch it means that its not actually thin enough to allow the heat to pass through. It is also best to keep the amount of exit possibilitys for the snake to a minimum, you can do this by detaching the pllug, drilling a hole in the vivarium at the bottom and putting the wire through. Then re attach a plug. This will give your snake the best themperature.|`|wLgGD63raa	It goes underneath.<br>  <br>  If you have a wooden viv, then you should definitely invest in a heat lamp, because wood does not hold heat well at all.|`|CUFnorZyaa	It should be attached underneath not inside. It will heat through the glass/plastic.
l0ktQUnWaa	It is a T8. It says it is compatible with standard fluorescent fixtures. I would say it uses the ballast!
FvAl3UgQaa	It depends somewhat on your climate, space constraints, etc., but I would generally recommend a captive bred Testudo hermanni boettgeri as a first tortoise. They're friendly, relatively hardy, max out at about 12" long and are readily available as captive bred hatchlings.<br>  <br>  ***********************<br>  <br>  Edit to add:<br>  <br>  In your climate, if you have the space for a larger tortoise, I would actually recommend a Red-foot (Geochelone carbonaria). They're fantastic tortoises and are, in my opinion, a good choice for a first tortoise *if* you don't live somewhere where you have to really struggle to keep up the humidity in their enclosure (which wouldn't be a big issue in Florida!)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chelonia.org/articles/redfootcare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chelonia.org/articles/redfoot...</a>|`|pf5G6ssJaa	i got Russian and greeks|`|uTIoOa62aa	cute pets|`|FrmKbM8waa	well what i have heard Russian or Greek =]|`|vS1Z0inOaa	That's really impossible to answer without knowing what you want from a tortoise and what kind of enclosure and care you are able to provide for it...<br>  -- there are giant ones like the sulcata and galapagos tortoises which require a huge field for grazing and a heated shelter and need to be kept in warm climate areas<br>  -- in contrast, there are tiny ones like the padloper tortoises which are usually under 4 inches long<br>  -- there are beautiful tortoises like the marginated tortoise and the madagascar spider or idian star tortoises<br>  -- there are plain ones like the russian and desert tortoises<br>  -- there are strange ones like the pancake and hingeback tortoises<br>  -- there are those that strictly graze on grass with a few greens thrown in like the sulcata and leopard tortoises<br>  -- there ar those that eat mostly greens like the russian, pancake, and greek tortoises<br>  -- there are those that enjoy eating earthworms and some fruit as well as greens like the hingebck and redfoot tortoises<br>  -- some require high humidity because they come from tropical fores habitat like the redfoot tortoises<br>  -- some require a very warm, drier habitat with regular soaks and a humid burrow because they come from a desert habitat, like the Russian and desrt tortoises<br>  -- there are those that ibernate in the wild and those that don't...<br>     You've really got to consider what type of diet you can provide and how much pace you're willing to put aside for a tortoise. Also the area you live in can restrict what kinds of tortoises are available. Here in the USA Russians are by far the most common tortoises and are easy to keep as they stay small and eat mstly greens. In the UK, Hermann's tortoises are much more common than Russians and have a different diet requirement which is easier to provide in the UK than the states (whichmay be why they're more common there ;) as they are also an easy tortoise to keep). However, since I have had mre experience with reptiles that required high humidity and a die including crickets and earthworms, and also since I had kept box turtles before and already had an enclosure planted for them, I found that a hingeback or redfoot tortoise would be much easier for me to start with than the more commony suggested Russian or Hermanns. So do your research and give us your criteria, then we can better make a good recommendation to you.

wLgGD63raa	There are some breeders that have a captive bred stock of these tortoises available but they are EXTREMELY expensive and you will more than likely need to have a permit to breed, sell, and own these animals.<br>  <br>  You would have to look into the state of Florida's regulations for exotic reptiles, as it varies from state to state.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Galapagos Tortoises are slowly decreasing.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Sweet Kitty!<br>  <br>  Bravo for having your sweet kitty neutered. I wish that everyone would be so kind to their cats and neuter and spay. Preventing unwanted kittens is not the only reason. Neutering and spaying helps to keep our cats healthier and far more affectionate.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cozycatfurniture.com/cat_newsletters/cat_newsletter_6_issue.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cozycatfurniture.com/cat_news...</a><br>  <br>  Neutered males make the best pets, in my opinion. I have two myself who are always next to me one way or another, and they sleep under the covers with us as well.<br>  <br>  While males generally go into puberty between 6-8 months with increased testosterone production, your kitten may have been precocious and now is turning more of his attention to you.

My male cat changed for the worst.  My female cat spent all of her time whining and worrying about getting it on with my male cat when she was not spayed.  Once she wasn't worrying about that, she was so happy.  She is very cuddly now and I love it.  My male cat was a little cuddly but never a real lover but after getting neutered he was not cuddly at all.  My mother went to pick him up at the vet for me after getting neutered and she forgot his carrier, and he tore up her arms and ran out into traffic on a main road.  I think it traumatized him quite a bit.  Lucky hes alive!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Neutering stops the production of hormones which can cause cats to be anxious, aggressive, and territorial.  By having your kitty neutered before he hit puberty you saved him from having to deal with all that.  He's probably glad to be home and realized he missed you after being away at the vet.  I'm glad it worked out well for you.  You did your kitty a big favor.|`|gU34xa9vaa	Well done for being sensible and having your cat neutered.He now doesn't have to be feeling frustrated and wanting to wander off after females, so he is giving his love to you.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Because his male hormones (Testosterone) have calmed down, he no longer needs to prove his dominance! enjoy the new improved him!|`|cj31x3UMaa	Hormones!<br>  <br>  5 months old (some breeds) the hormones are starting to kick in & in some cases I have seen cats go all "exorcist".<br>  <br>  Neutered males make the BEST pets ever!|`|Iqh7U5Ypaa	because where he has been neutered he has 'calmed down' so he doesnt have as many 'urges' as before... because of this he will be much calmer and will be as you say... a very sweet cat!|`|tWtMUZhnaa	Because he doesnt have the same feeling for females.
RvddYKqjaa	They definitely can jump out, and size doesn't matter. I used a piece of screen door screening, the fine mesh kind, and molded it to the shape of the top.

qeOlkRM0aa	Going through the nitrogen cycle. This is where you grow beneficial  bacteria in the tank that breaks down ammonia from fish waste (poop and uneaten food etc.) to nitrites. More bacteria is grown to break down the Nitrites to Nitrates. The reason this is necessary,  is because Ammonia and Nitrites are toxic to fish and other critters. This bacteria grows on substrates in your tank and/or filters. Once  the tank is cycled, the bacteria will do its job automatically.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	No. Cycling means allowing the tank to sit for a few weeks without fish, while daily adding a source of ammonia in the form of fish food or pure ammonia. This will prime your tank for fish because beneficial bacteria will build up that breaks down fish waste.<br>  <br>  This site thoroughly explains the process- <a href="http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/fishless-cycle/" rel="nofollow">http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/20...</a>|`|p1gzHgAraa	they are talking about the nitrification cycle. its how good bacteria blooms and is kept in a tank. if you havent read anything about it, i suggest you dont buy any fish until you have read on how to properly cycle a tank. <br>  <br>  just google or yahoo "nitrification cycle" there is alot of good info out there on it.. it will save you from killing a bunch of fish, and save you money in the long run if you read up on it.|`|rSfoEyE3aa	Cycling is the process that takes place when you purchase a new tank to make sure that ammonia and nitrite and nitrate is not precent in the tank.First you set up all your equipmet in the tank this includes everything you need like filter , heater stones , ornaments etc. you run the aqurium 24hr a day with the heater , filter , pump etc this process is taking place when the tank is fishless you then check the tank each day for ammonia nitrite and nitrate with tests that you can buy either ina petstore or online these test will tell you if the ammonia etc if prescent in the tank if the test is 0 you can start stocking your tank and you can stop your cycle.If the test has till not reached 0 then you have to continue your cycle . this process can take up to 6 weeks but must be done especialy for marine saltwater fish as these fish are extremely delicate and need alot of care and maintanience.also if you are stocking a saltwater aquarium and have live rock prescent in your aquarium it is advisable to put some flake food in the aquarium once a day even though there are no fish precent it builds up benefical bacteria which helps you through your cycle.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped|`|DU7iO8EHaa	No it doesnt mean cleaning it. You have to do it before you put fish in. Here is a link <a href="http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles/misc/fishlesscycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquatic-hobbyist.com/profiles...</a>|`|1bSG5LCPaa	I believe it means before adding fish you must let the water run through a filter for a whole day, setting the temperature, removing the chlorine and such :)|`|AA10804822	it means taking your tank out for a bike ride!!
ymU9QGlUaa	I have to agree with bozema on this one.  Cropping should never be done by a breeder, only a licensed vet. This dog was mutilated by an animal abuser.

AraBfesHaa	It could have had swim bladder disease.  If it hasn't died yet, put it in a container by itself and feed it 1 or 2 blanched frozen peas, with the skin removed. (mash it up a bit) That should help it.  It wouldn't hurt to feed the others the same thing occasionally also, it helps with their digestion.<br>  It may have also had dropsy. It can be treated with Maracyn2.  That's the only thing I've found that actually says dropsy on the box.  It works for alot of things, even more than the label says.  I wouldn't be without it.<br>  It could also just simply be constipation.  The peas help with that also.<br>  Just because it's laying at the bottom of the tank doesn't mean it's dead.

I believe that (many years ago) the old Twilight Zone series did an episode on this about an old man and his hunting dog.  How they went out "coon hunting" and a raccoon sat on the dog's head in the water trying to drown him.  The old many went in to save the dog and both died.  Later it showed him and his dog walking down that road and encountering the supposed gates of "Heaven" and being told he couldn't enter with his dog, etc. etc.  Again, a wonderful story which is so uplifting.

6uFaP2OAaa	Well it depends on your country and high school.  Chances are it's a little different to where I live :P  So I can only tell you what applies here in Australia; you might be a little different.<br>  But you'll need to take all the top classes you can to get the best marks.  Biology for sure, top maths, top English, and doing another science would help too (chemistry, perhaps).  I'm pretty sure those subjects are compulsory, and others would just help to add to your final mark.<br>  To get into Veterinary courses outright you need the highest mark you can possibly get.  Vet courses are harder to get into that human Medicine!  You'll have to be really dedicated and study as much as you can if you want to make it.
alIO8ic0aa	Crate train! We have a 11 mo and 5 mo babies. Crate training is the best way to go. You want to get a crate that is large enough for when they get full size but one that has a divider. You want their space to be large enough for them to lay down and turn around. They will not go where they sleep.<br>  <br>  Keeping to a regular schedule helps. When mine stirred at night I would let them out. It wasn't long before they slept through the night.<br>  <br>  The change in their food could be cause for their diarrhea. You should gradually introduce new food into their diet. It could also be caused by other factors such as the parvo virus. Puppies can dehydrate very quickly so it's important for you to get your pets to the vet for their initial examinations.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Holy cow!  Well usually you only have between 24 and 72 hours to get them to a vet, depending on your contract for their new puppy exam.  I would get them to the vets right away, since there is a new strain of parvo going around, parvo 2c, and you don't want to play around with that.  The diarrhea could be cause by many things, but it is unlikely that the breeder will pay for the cost, since you waited so long to get them to the vets.  The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  I would get separate crates, so if one goes potty in the crate, you will know which one to work with.  You can't leave them in the crate all night, so set a timer or alarm  to wake up and take them potty.  Use puppy shampoo for their baths, and make sure they are really dry if it is winter where you live.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|9kTejB0uaa	Hehehe - double trouble eh!!  First off, I recommend you get two crates!  Treat these two as two separate puppies.  Crate them overnight and with luck at least, even if you have to get up at least once during the night, you won't come down to wall to wall in the morning.  Normally puppies don't go in their crates (it does happen with some however, initially and the answer to this is to actually feed them in their crates which helps to stop this behaviour).<br>  <br>  The diarrhoea, did you continue to feed them what they were on when you picked them up?  If not, an abrupt switch to something new is enough to give them the runs.  And sometimes even a change of water can do this.  Hopefully provided this isn't the start of something more serious, their tums will settle down (you could check with their breeder to find out what food they were on, and switch them back, assuming they were okay before you picked them up).  <br>  <br>  Bathing them at this stage isn't necessarily a good idea, although if they are really bad, you could sponge them over.<br>  <br>  You do need to book them into your vet - normally it's a good idea to take them in within the first 48 hours to be checked over.  At that point he will advise you re their vaccination schedule, and worming.<br>  <br>  Lastly, if you bought these two from a good breeder (and actually most good breeders don't really like to send two puppies - from the same litter? - to other than an experienced home), these people should be there to offer help and advice if needed.|`|8cfefc5af44447d76c62ae1054d75d99aa	Are the puppies from the same litter??  If so, you may have problems, especially with male pups as there will always be rivalry that may not ever be settled. <br>  <br>  If they can smell even the tiniest amount of urine or poop, they will keep repeating their 'accidents' in the same place.  Try to disinfect as well as you can, and keep them away from the spot for a while.  You could try crate training them, as they will not ever want to soil their beds, so put them to bed in their crate (after a final goodnight wee outside!) and dont put any food/water in with them overnight. Get up quite early, take them out of their crates and immediately take them outside to do their business.  Remember their bladders are quite small, so a few accidents are expected, but they will soon learn that outside is the proper area to do it.  <br>  <br>  Some pups get a runny tummy when they are nervous or excited, so it may just be a change of scenery.  If they are eating well, and drinking lots, I wouldn't panick too much, but if it continues, or they stop drinking, better be safe and pop to the vets.  <br>  <br>  You can bath them anytime, but try not to use any harsh shampoos.  Water wont hurt, and you'll be suprised how much better they smell with just a bit of warm water to rinse off the worst of it.  You can also buy puppy shampoo, try not to get it in their ears, eyes or nose!!  <br>  <br>  Good Luck! xx|`|oFMCWge3aa	Hi  xx good luck and enjoy you new puppies!! here is some advice:....<br>  <br>  Housebreaking your new puppy is going to take patience. Puppies need to relieve themselves approximately six times a day. A puppy should be taken out immediately after each meal since a full stomach puts pressure on the colon and bladder.<br>  <br>  A puppy is not physically able to control the muscle that allows him to "hold it" until he is about 12 weeks of age.  Before this time, good housebreaking routines should be practiced to avoid having your puppy urinate and defecate all over your house.  Watch for signs of urination or defecation, such as turning in circles.  Take your puppy out often.  Using a crate or confining your puppy to a small part of the house that has easy clean up floors are some ways to ensure your puppy does not urinate all over your house.  It is much harder to housebreak a puppy if he smells is urine in places you do not wish him to relief himself.<br>  <br>  If your puppy relieves himself on your floor and you show your disapproval five minutes after he has committed the act, the puppy will think that the mess on the floor is bad.  He will not relate to the fact that it was the act of relieving himself on your floor that you disapprove of. The dog will eliminate, see the mess and get worried; you are now going to be unhappy. This is the reason so many dogs will relieve themselves in inappropriate places and look really guilty about it, yet they continue to do it. Dogs want to please, right?<br>  <br>  Some owners start to think that their dog is being sneaky when really it does not fully understand what it is doing wrong. It knows the mess upsets you but does not understand that it should stop "making" the mess. To your dog, these two things:  "the mess" and "the act"are unrelated. The trick is to catch your dog in the act and make him understand. You do not need to hit your dog. The tone of your voice is enough to make the dog see you are unhappy. A firm "No! You are not  allowed to go in the house. No! No!" is all that is needed. Immediately take your dog outside to the appropriate place. Wait for your dog to go again and when and if he does, praise him. Remember!!: ALWAYS praise your dog after he eliminates in the appropriate place with verbal commands or with doggy treats!!<br>  <br>  Make sure everyone who is involved in the housebreaking process is using the same spot in the yard and the same word. Everyone should agree on the place they will take the puppy. The odor from the previous visits will cause the puppy to want to go in that spot. Use a simple word like "outside" when taking your puppy to the chosen spot. Use this word consistently and later this word will help build communication between the family and the dog. When you notice him going toward the door and you say "outside" he can say "Yup, that’s where I need to go," or, "Forget it. I am getting back up on the couch for some shut eye."<br>  <br>  In order for dogs to successfully live among humans, the humans must be the pack leaders. In the wild, pack leaders do not give affection to lower members of the pack. What they do give are rules the pack must follow, limits to what they can and cannot do and boundaries the pack must not cross. <br>  <br>  The diarrohoea problems<br>  Have they got these:<br>  1. unformed faeces<br>  2. an increase in frequency of defaecation<br>  3. an increase in volume of faeces<br>  If your dog is only passing soft faeces once or twice a day, although abnormal it is strictly not diarrhoea but merely looseness of the bowel.<br>  <br>  If you are sure it is diarrohoea then you could try the following (asking your vet first !!) <br>  <br>  *Give 100% pure canned pumpkin (NOT the pumkin pie filling with sugars and spices). Most dogs love the flavor of pumpkin, but it is a unique fiber that regulates the bowel. It will color the stool. <br>  *Refresh (dump, wash bowl, refill) several times daily.<br>  *Add a probiotic powder to the dog's water, or feed your dog a brand of healthy pet food that includes probiotics.<br>  <br>  Dogs with diarrhea can dehydrate quickly. Provide ample fresh water and ensure that your dog is drinking. If your dog is dehydrated and will not drink or is vomiting, see your vet immediately! <br>  <br>  Don't give your dog new foods that they have never eaten while you are still treating the diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Yes there is no problem in giving them a bath - dont let them roll in their poop!!! yeuurrgghhh!!<br>  <br>  I really hope i helped you!!<br>  Hope your puppies are OK!! XDxxx|`|uXAV4wP0aa	I also got two puppies around the same time (about two weeks apart) so I know what you're going through! :)<br>  <br>  I crate trained mine. It works well and they actually really like their crate. In the day, I'll leave its door open and they'll go in and take a nap or play around. <br>  <br>  When mine were young puppies, I brought them outside for a wee and poo every half hour. I know it seems like alot but they got used to going outside and they caught on really quickly. Eventually I cut it down to once an hour and so on. And now they're all potty trained! They'll even sit by the door when they need to go out. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you're using an enzymatic cleaner like Natures Miracle when cleaning the poo and wee in the house. Even if you think it's clean the dog can still smell it. If it smells like a bathroom to your dog, it is a bathroom! <br>  <br>  As for the diarrhea, it could be the food. Like everyone else said when you switch their food without them getting used to it they could get diarrhea. It could also be something more serious like giardia. Something like 30% of puppies under a year are infected with it. This is something only a vet can diagnose so get them in! :) <br>  <br>  It's alright to give them a bath anytime. Make sure to use dog shampoo though! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZSXstSXBaa	There are different ways to house train a new puppy. Impo, crate training is the easiest. The instructions come in or on the box. The diarrhea could just be from stress and anxiety, my dachshund got diarrhea when I first got her and the vet said it's just the stress from not being with her litter and mother anymore. I would still call your vet and make an appointment! Also, my vet told me to give her unflavored pedialyte (the stuff you give children when they're sick) because they can loose nutrients when they have diarrhea. Also, when you do finally bring her to the vet, ask about getting puppy vitamins!|`|o0fjzrDhaa	ummm... the only thing i can say (do) is when it gets older it will get smarter and he (she will know what to do.i have a dog and when i got hin he was the same! after few months every time he needs to go out he knocks at the door!! so good luck with ur puppy i hope you take good care of him (her).|`|EYOQVTGbaa	I think you should first of all go down to pets at home and ask their advise as they ar very help full.

It will soon realize that it should be doing it in the garden and not in the house. Remember not to punish it when it does a mistake,. Otherwise it will get the wrong idea and may try to hold it in. <br>  The dahrea may be due to the food, even if they love it . if you where told to give it to your pups by the person you got it from ,, you cant always trust the owners, as they may have not realised before that the food was causing it to have tummy trouble. I had this problem with my kitten, I gave it the food it would usualy have and it kept throwing up so we took it to the vets and they just said it wasnt very suitable for kittens and we just got this soft vets food and my kitten loved it ! this could be your case, I suggest either trying puppy food made for pups or taking it to the vets after all it could have eaten something else (like a plant) or it could just be ill. This may be something you should try after testing with different food. In the meantime, make sure you have lots of disinfectant and carpet cleaner on you !<br>  <br>  as they are puppys dont bathe them regularly but seeing as they have rolled in their muck it is pretty important to do this, before they spread germs everywhere !! maybe u should de- tangle its fur first with a dog brush.<br>  If your puppy is under 8 weeks old just bathe them using puppy wipes and water , if they dont like the water you can just use a damp cloth.<br>  but if it is older than 8 weeks, heres what to do :<br>  When you do have to bathe your puppy make sure you use specially formulated dog shampoos which produce less lather and thus are easier and quicker to rinse off. Wet your puppy first with clean, warm water, then introduce the shampoo. Rinse the dog and squeeze the hair with your hands to remove excess water. Dry using towels or with a hairdryer, but don't put it to close to the skin.|`|7Cis2pJEaa	First off...take one back! You should never get 2 at once. They will bond with each other, and not their 'human pack'. And they will be almost impossible to train. If you must keep both, keep them separated 99% of the time. Also they are too young to be housebroken. Its takes a few months of training for any dog to be reliable. They can't even hold it a few hours until they are 7-9months old! You need to take them to a vet ASAP. They need to get a full exam not just shots, and best to have blood work done soon. diahreah is not normal, but puppy chow is a bad food for them to begin with. I know many human children that would love to eat ice cream and cookies all day too! Does not mean its good for them!<br>  You should have done way more research before getting a dog. I feel bad for these poor souls.|`|Rrpb5aLMaa	Bath~ you should give them a bath soon. and about every two weeks or so. It will make your life easier later on if they are used to it.<br>  <br>  Diarrheaa ~ That is because you are feeding them something they were not eating before. Anytime you change the food there stool will become soft.<br>  <br>  Potty Training~<br>  1.Dont scolding your dog. ( I find witIntelligentnt dogs If you scold them when they potty they will find away to hide and pee so they dont get yelled at and they will become afraid of you.)<br>  <br>  2. Make sure you are watching for suttle signs they give off. ( Most every dog will circle, sniff, and some times try to get away from you when they need to potty)<br>  <br>  3. If you are diligent about your taking your dog out when ever they look like they may need to eventually they will figure out how to tell you they need to go.<br>  <br>  4. give them treats for going potty outside but only for the first time she pees and poops. The rest just tell her good girl.<br>  <br>  5. Remember that after meals and naps dog have to use the rest room in 10 to 30 min food and water runs through their systems pretty fast.<br>  <br>  6. Also make sure your dog is getting plenty of exersise at least an hour of hard exercise a day. Dog park or a run or something. I have found 5 out of every 10 problems get better if not stop with lots of exersise.<br>  <br>  I Hope this helps I know how frustrating potty training can be!!|`|mk4ZUgu8aa	we had a litter of puppies last yr so i can try and help a bit :)<br>  <br>  we trained all of our puppies before we sold them to go to bathroom on newspaper, we put paper down in a certain part of our kitchen and that's where they go!.. if they start to pee/poo grab them and put them on the paper, offer them lots of praise when they do.. they'll gradually make the link! and when they're bigger they'll associate going to the bathroom with going outside (i.e about an hour or so after feeding them take them for a walk)<br>  <br>  how old are they? if they haven;t had jabs yet i'd recommend booking an appointment for their first jabs soon! also have they been wormed? that might explain the diarrhoea..<br>  <br>  as with bathing them try not to make a habit out of it, u shouldn;t bathe dogs too much anyways but if u do use warm water and no products (most dog shampoos aren't suitable for young dogs) and keep them nice and warm!<br>  <br>  other than that enjoy the puppies and that's great u got 2! our litter was soo sweet, it was really sad to separate the final 2 when we sold the last one coz they were so close! ur very lucky :)|`|uoaGIVsFaa	If you work on crate training with the pups it should help the bathroom problem. I did that with my pup and she wouldn't go in the crate because it's where she slept when she was in it. Puppies can "hold it" (in hours) for the how old they are in months + 1. So, if I went out for a quick errand (after I took my pup outside to go potty) I could be assured that I had a few hours before they could possibly make a mess in the crate. Crate training also works well if you wear them out a lot and then put them in there. They will love their little "home" where they can sleep and it is harder for people to bother them.Also, at night, puppies still have to go to the bathroom. You need to wake up and take them out. They can't hold it for as long as we can. They need a potty break (I know it's not convenient, but it will help so you don't have messes in the morning).  If you put them in their crate at night, and take them out at least once, they are far less likely to mess in the place they are sleeping (because of the potty break and it's their bed!). And you know where they are all night. <br>  <br>  As for baths, you can give them baths whenever. Make sure it's tear free shampoo though! And you might want to make sure you blow dry them a little when you're done (on low, and moving all around the body as to not stay in one spot and burn them) so they don't get cold. Giving them a bath will help once a week will help when they get older so that when you do give them baths when they're older, they are used to it and don't resist as much. <br>  <br>  The diarrhea problem could be because of a change of the food in their diet. Most dogs might have diarrhea for a while after switching foods. It also might be because of stress (the sudden change of being brought to your house). It should go away after a few days. If not, take them to a vet. <br>  <br>  Have fun with your new pups! Puppies are always exciting!!!! A wonderful addition to any family!|`|tWtMUZhnaa	You can buy puppy training pads for your puppies.Also if you see them pooing you can stick there nose in it and they will think twice about doing it again.I suggest you get to your local vet to organise a appoitment.My puppy had diahreeha i think it was because of the swap from milk to solids and it soon sorted its self out.You should start training your puppies when they are young so they will be better as they get older.I think you are allowed to bath them anytime.Hope that helped|`|SJBJ85caaa	4 house breaking you can buy stuff 4 that at a pet store.you can also train them 2 go outside but it might take a while they have to get use to no going on the floor.idk y they would have diahreeha food u give them is an exeexcellent kind and u seem 2 be giving them enough food.they probally dont like sitting in there poop and pee so u should probally give them a bath every time they roll in it and try 2 keep them out of it.good luck with the puppies i had to go through the same thing.|`|DPym2oe5aa	pink lady :), I wish I had a a chow chow.

Melanophore Migration<br>  (or healing) Black marks could mean the skin is healing from ammonia burn or another chemical if the fish is in good water these spots will fade away with in a few days.

You can change 35% of the water now...put some Ammonia Remover into ur filter system and Aquarium Salts in to ur water to help clean the burns ( Mosty 1 teaspons for 5Gals water, but read the box to make sure)<br>  2. Put some water on the side, whatever u need for change 35% of water on ur tank!<br>  3. Doing Part 1 after 3 days, use the water u save on Part 2. add whatever is 35% water = among the salt back into the tank..it is ok if alittle less. ( By this step u should see the Black Spots smaller) And save some water on side again (Replay Part 2)<br>  4. Doing Part 3 again ( by this time all the Black spots should be all goes away)<br>  Ur fish should be fixed within 10 days.. if not burning too bad!<br>  Good Luck and hope it helps!!|`|DU7iO8EHaa	It isn't ich, ich is white.

Rw7gi86Naa	Purring — Cats, (big and small) are the only animals who purr. Contrary to popular belief, purring isn't speaking. Some people believe the sound comes from two membrane folds, called false vocal cords, that are situated in the larynx behind the actual vocal cords. Cats purr 26 cycles per second, the same as an idling diesel engine. Cats purr both when inhaling and exhaling, keeping the mouth completely closed, and only stopping to swallow. Kittens are born blind and deaf, but the vibrations of their mother's purring is a physical signal that the kittens can feel. It acts as a homing device, signaling them to nurse. Kittens begin purring at about one week old; then it's a signal to the mother cat that they're getting their milk and are content. Since purring is non-vocal, it doesn't interfere with the suckling. Contrary to another popular belief, cats don't purr purely for pleasure. Be alert: a deep purr can indicate that a cat is in pain or distress. Female cats will purr when in labor. Cats may purr in fear or anxiety. They will also purr in anticipation of being fed or stroked. Big African cats only purr in short bursts, but the house cat can purr for hours. <br>  <br>  Distress — Mewing is a plea for help or attention often made by kittens. There are two basic types of this call, one more loud and frantic, and the other more high-pitched. In older cats it is more of a panicky repeated meow. <br>  <br>  Attention — Often simple meows and mews in both older cats and young kittens. A commanding meow is a command for attention, food, or to be let out. <br>  <br>  Protest — Whining meows. <br>  <br>  Frustration — A strong sigh or exhaled snort. <br>  <br>  Happy — A meow that starts low then goes up and comes back down. <br>  <br>  Watching/Interest — Cats will often "chatter" or "chirrup" on seeing something of interest out of the window. This is sometimes attributed to mimicking birdsong to attract prey or draw others attention to it, but often birds are not present. Bengals and Tabbies seem more likely to display this behavior.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	The different meows are different from one cat to another so you have to learn your individual cat's meows.|`|IuYekkPVaa	The Messybeast web site has a very interesting article on feline vocalisation explaining the different types of meow that you might find helpful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk.htm</a>|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	As you get to know your cat, the meows and their meanings will come to you.  I have 8 cats and I can tell the different meows, who said them, and what it means from across the house.
YQ1Q7XeEaa	In the old days we'd just tap him with the whip a few times and they usually would get the message.<br>  <br>  In these kinder, gentler days I would recommend using whatever training method was used when he was broken.<br>  <br>  Biting is a serious issue, I know he's not biting you now and is probably playing around but once they get the message that this behavior is OK it will be harder to stop him later.<br>  <br>  Also - he may not have bitten yet but how would it feel if he bit down  on someone else who didn't know what he was doing? They might overreact and end up spooking the horse.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	He is being mouthy, which is very typical of horses under four years of age. If this behavior is not corrected it can quickly escalate to biting. The next time he goes to lip at your jacket take him firmly by his halter and say "NO" very firmly. If that doesn't deter him, give him a little whack on his shoulder. Never hit him in the head as that can lead to head shyness, but you want to be very firm that this behavior is a no-no.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	My gelding does that too and he's just trying to see what he can get away with. your horse is still young so he needs to learn a lot. <br>  <br>  When my horse does something like that, I just have to say his name in a firm voice and he'll stop whatever it is he's doing.<br>  <br>  If he's headshy, use your voice. If that doesn't work, give him a good jerk on the lead rope and tell him "NO".<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! good luck!<br>  <br>  =D|`|N2jvxYPcaa	Since your horse is doing it in a non-aggressive way (at least for now) I wouldn't treat him really aggressively back. But I would discourage this behavior in another way, because it can lead to him starting to think he's the boss. Think of it this way - a non-dominant horse does not go over to the boss horse and start nibbling on him!<br>  I would say "no" sharply, and then start backing the horse firmly away from me. I'm not talking backing slowly - ones slow step, two slow steps, and then quit. I mean, back him up firmly quite a few steps, at least ten feet and preferably farther. Make it a bit as though you're chasing him backwards, have him retreat with some effort.<br>  Then allow him to stop and forget all about it. Go back to doing what you were doing before, and don't hold any grudge. <br>  If he grabs hold of the jacket again, send him backwards firmly again. Most horses are lazy, and pretty soon he'll decide this isn't worth the effort. Plus, there is something about directing a horse's feet that directs their mind. The boss horse backs up or move the other horses out of their space. This is all you're doing.<br>  If he isn't haltered it will be tougher. I think I'd just raise my hands and chase him away a distance and then totally forget about it and allow him to come back. But you'll have to be careful if you do it this way because it could become a big game with him, and he can out move and out fight you if he decided to play like a horse back. Perhaps keep your pockets stuffed with a few mid sized rocks and be prepared to throw one at his ribs and back him off. He can understand this sort of language, and I don't think you'll make him scared or spooked of you. Yes, if you chase him aggressively around the corral throwing rocks, it will scare him. But if he nibbles, and you give him a firm whack and move him out of your space and then totally stop, he should be okay.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	chances are he is bored.<br>  my old man does this sort of habit too, and it's easier to fix it now then wait. (it can turn into a serious biting habit if you aren't careful)<br>  for now, just give him a slight smack on the nose, nothing hard, just enough to get him to let go. also correct him if he starts to chew on other things, like rails, his lead rope, or his reins.<br>  also, stop feeding him out of hand (if you do).<br>  and, is he trying to groom you? (all lips, sort of wiggling around, like he is grooming another horse) or is he actually taking your coat in his teeth?<br>  if he's using his teeth, then it is serious (like biting), but if he's just trying to groom you then consider yourself to be well bonded with your horse! <br>  my horse tends to groom my hair every time i wear a pony tail<br>  <br>  XD<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps & good luck!|`|iz03uvV4aa	I hate to say it but if you give him an inch, he is bound and bent to take a mile eventually.  Its always best not to encourage these types of behaviors at all. Playful or not, it in many ways signifies dominance.  He is nibbling at you "playfully" like he would another of his own kind and this establishes a dominance to him.  If you dont stop the behavior now, it might escalate to a bit of a nip and eventually a bite. Like I say, its best to not allow that at all as you dont ever want the issue of trying to re-establish your place with him.  Especially a young horse. Either or, nibbling isnt good manners.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck =)<br>  <br>  Edit**<br>  <br>  You dont have to "hit" him per say.  What you can do is create the lesson to emply that he "ran into your hand".  Ideally - have your elbow there and intentionally position it so that when he does go to grab ahold of your jacket your elbow is "circumstantially" there and he will bump into it.  You just want to make it so its "uncomfortable" every time he attempts and make it so he is teaching himself the lesson and finds that everytime he goes to try this "trick" he is getting a reaction he doesnt like. =)|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	I have a couple horses that do that too. They are just bored. Sometimes they do it because they want an itch, be happy they feel comfortable with you to do that. <br>  <br>  I think its a comfort thing more or less. I would not be worried about it. Also another thing to think about is maybe you have something on it, like a mineral they might be interested in. Same as your hands when your horse licks them they are licking the sweat off your hand. Or also along the same reason of why they have tendencies to eat dirt, because the dirt has minerals that they lack or that they love (natural instincts). <br>  <br>  If you want to break the habbit instead of hitting him just just nudge him away with your elbow or turn away from him so he cannot touch you again. But he might not think he is doing anything wrong so just move away like a horse would do. <br>  <br>  I had a 36 year old Gelding that like to rest his teeth on something and drool lol. Totally harmless just relaxed and comfortable around me.|`|vZFLG75Zaa	young horses are like kids.  They love to play and get themselves in trouble.  If you dont like it at all, I would suggest not letting his muzzle get too close to you.  That is his punishment.  If he wants to be near you, he has to be nice.  And if he gets close, you take his lead rope and pull him away.  And if he does nibble, take the lead rope and give him a firm tug.  Yes, never hit him in the face, that may be a first reaction thing, but that will make him so headshy, especially at such a young age.  If anything, I would definitely ask a professional who deals with  horse manners.|`|XB0UpJsLaa	He is probably bored. My 4 year old does this too. Give him a smack on the nose, and say quit! It's good to correct this before it does turn into biting. Good Luck :D|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	We have a nearly 3 year old gelding and he does exactly the same thing. <br>  If you're telling him off then don't hit his head, try either slapping his shoulder or 'biting' the skin on his neck. Do this by pinching it a bit.<br>  <br>  It is a youngster thing and he should grow out of it with help. To start with use your voice sharply as a reprimand as it sounds like he pays attention to you. You're right to say he's not being mean, he just being a young gelding/colt.<br>  <br>  Another thing we do is when he's in a chewy mood, it's usually cause he's teething so he gets the end of the rope or something like that to chew on but don't accept him chewing on you. they are smart enough to know the difference.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	I know several horses who try to groom me back this way when I am scratching them. I do allow it in very limited circumstances.<br>  <br>  Only after I have started to scratch them. Only with lips. Only on cloth. Never with an aggressive face motion.<br>  <br>  I watch them every second while they are doing it and after a little bit of this (no more than an minute or so of being very, very quiet), push their face away. If they do too much or get too aggressive, I push their face away immediately.<br>  <br>  Your horse is a little young for me to advise you that this is OK. I would simply push his face away when he starts, not angrily, but firmly and consistently. He'll get the idea.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and push him by the jawbone, not on the nose. That's how horses do it.
wnnudNp5aa	Do not attempt to make your own tank. At least not a 75 gallon one. That's 600 pounds of water it will have to hold!

7Cis2pJEaa	I would get an older pit bull. Sound like your house is a great home for the breed, but puppies are a holy terror at this age! And they make a mess. Get one that is 2-3 years old. That way they are past the chewing, wetting, pooping in house stage. Plenty of well trained reliable pits at this age in rescues. Look for a rescue that keeps its dogs in foster homes. That way you know how the dog behaves indoors. Plus 99% of the training is already done for you. I foster for a pit bull rescue. Look at www.pbrc.net<br>  I am sure you will find just what your looking for. Don't get a dog just by its appearance. Make sure you look into his personality and training so that it fits your living situation.|`|tWtMUZhnaa	I think if you have thought about this long and hard and you both feel you have the  knowledge and time and care for a pitbull puppy let alone another puppy.They are known to be aggressive but if you get them from a young age im sure it will be a great addition to your family.But please make sure you have thought about this.It is great to know you have gone to a local rescue center instead of a breeder.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	From my experience, pits generally do not smell too bad. I would, however, be concerned about skin allergies that may make her smelly.<br>  <br>  Take her everywhere. Socialization, for ALL dogs is extremely important. Dog, parks, to PetSmart (or any other place that allows dogs in), to your family, everywhere. Also, don't be scared when someone or another dog comes up to her. They sense that and tense up in defense.|`|9IVYh3Cjaa	Depends. Statistically, they ARE the most prone to attacking other people. But most should be fine, and since it's for a good cause and you really like him/her you will be happy. but you should be worried that your house will smell like dog, because no matter what kind of dog you get it can't be avoided. Hope I helped!|`|PdaiyUkDaa	pits are great dogs i have one i got at that same age would not trade her for anything  check this website for info and help we love all bully breeds there  www.bulldogbreeds.com  great site kudos to you for rescuing|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	A Pit is not a good dog for a first time dog owner.  They will push you to the inth degree.  They are very stubborn.  I have seen only a small hand full of Pits that had a good temperament.<br>  <br>  I myself would not own one.  Nor would I ever own a little tiny yapper.<br>  <br>  I wish there was someway I could let my knowledge of Pits just enter your head so you would have a better idea of what this breed is like.  I have been bit a number of times by this breed & it was always in saving a child from an attack or stopping a dog fight since they are so proned to canine aggression.  Even worked with a few on aggression training but they didn't do very good.  <br>  <br>  I do think that all the Bully dog are beautiful dogs but due to improper breeding the breed has many genetic problems.  Too many back yard breeders breed dogs with a huge amount of faults to another dog that is full of all its faults.  So you get a really messed up dog.<br>  <br>  Just hope & pray that the little guy is better than most.<br>  <br>  All those little tests you did with the puppy mean nothing now.  Here is a set guide for testing puppies.  I sent the search page with all the sites so you can do all the tests properly.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Puppies go through an adolescence stage in their life where they are destructive, nippy, and just don't listen and that is exactly how old the puppy is.  You must be willing to devote a lot of time to your new dog, making sure you reinforce housebreaking and give it a ton of exercise.  I would also recommend taking it to puppy or obedience classes.<br>  <br>  I have dogs, as long as you keep your house clean and you have a well behaved dog, you house shouldn't smell a lot different.  If you don't like the smell have candles or air fresheners-- even just open a window.  Pit Bulls have short coats so they are pretty good and keeping groomed and tidy.<br>  <br>  Remember, DOGS ARE A RESPONSIBILITY and they WILL make messes!  If you're not ready for cleaning and taking care of another living creature but still want a pet... Think about getting fish!<br>  <br>  Thanks for adopting!|`|daXyjZfhaa	OK, for one THANK YOU for rescuing a pit bull!! Especially a puppy one, because some stupid person might come in and take him and not know how to raise him to be a happy healthy balanced dog. If I were you, I would watch a lot of Cesar Milan, he rescues fighting pit bulls that are now lovely around little kids and all other animals and humans. He teaches you that you must be a pack leader, treat your dog as a dog, and have rules boundary's and limitations. Take him for an hour walk at least once a day. If you have a treadmill, that works too. If you don't use a stair case, dogs need exercise on a daily basis, this helps with chewing and digging. Also, if you don't want your house to smell like dog, use a swiffer wet jet once a day to clean the floors, the wet jet has a scented spray so that will help a bit. And use febreeze on the dog bed. And don't let him on the couch, this way he won't be on it when your not home and lick it and sniff it and get it all snotty. <br>  <br>  And give him a bath atleast once a month. or twice a month. And brush him everyday.|`|ZQrPoHjTaa	Pits are usually pretty clean dogs. They tend to shed very little and have way less body odor than most breeds. That being said keep a bottle of Natures Miracle around, trust me. There will be accidents. Also, dont know if this will be your first dog, but if you are a neat freak, make sure you get the anal glands expressed every few weeks or once a month. This is a smell you do not want to encounter.|`|Zv7aPjcQaa	Pit Bull's are a GREAT breed of dog and I say follow your heart. As far as the smelling goes, give your dog a bath once a week and don't leave him outside for too long. It will keep the smell out. But some dogs just smell, dogs are a lot of work and you have to be committed to them. Please don't get the dog and rehome him after you find out that he smells like a dog. Well, he is a dog and will always be one. Always hope for the best but ALWAYS be ready for the worst.|`|giBfNMX6aa	There's a link below that will give you plenty of info on the breed.  The only thing lacking was whether they are smelly dogs, but it did say they are moderate shedders.  Puppies will chew and, until completely house trained, will have accidents.  I have a Scotty that doesn't shed at all (which I love!), but he does need a bath every 3 weeks as he will get rather stinky.  Love him anyway - :-)|`|okAYAGvXaa	I'm getting a good laugh at your stupid question.<br>  PMSing????|`|1Is7u1wUaa	It doesn't really matter what breed of dog you get, it will smell of dog and you'll have to clean it more often. However, if this is your only concern, whippets are virtually odour free and will probably keep your house the cleanest.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Ooook, well there are breeds out there that have less doggy smell than pits, Whippets are one of them, but pits pretty clean dogs and there's more than one way to kill that doggy smell.<br>  <br>  What your feed your dog will often determine how doggy it smells.  Feed it low quality crap food, and your dog will stink and probably have gas.  Feed it high quality good food and it reduces the doggy smell.  Pit's are short haired and very easy to bathe too.  If they start stinking, bath time.  Problem solved.  You can also limit where you're pet is allowed to be.  If you don't allow them on the couch, guess what, you're couch will not smell like the dog.<br>  <br>  What you can't get past, no how, no way, is that dogs shed.  They all do.  Even the shedless breeds shed at least a little bit.  Pits have short hair so they don't shed like a shepherd would (blowing out half their coat twice a year) but they do shed a little bit all the time.  Again, there are ways around it, zoom grooms are a wonderful little tool that works great on dogs like pits and will help reduce the shedding.  They're cheap too.  But ... you will be running the vacuum more often with any dog than you would be without.<br>  <br>  I love pits.  They're awesome dogs.  The only reason I wouldn't recommend getting one is all the crazy stuff that goes with owning one.  A lot of places that rent, won't rent to a pit.  If you own, some homeowners insurance won't insure you with a pit.  Where you live could suddenly pass breed specific legislation and make your dog illegal.  These are all things you need to think about.  These are reasons why I do not have a pit.  Love the breed, don't want the hassels that come along with the breed.<br>  <br>  Good luck though!|`|AA11244754	okay, I love the fact that you are wanting to get a rescue (yay for you for listening to us adoptive parents), also I applaud you for having done research on the breed because no matter how much you can raise them using positive re-enforcement there is a chance that they will snap and attack somebody or another animal, but have you considered a slightly older young dog (as in a young adult that is about 1 to 2 years of age)?  They are usually house broken (especially if they are being fostered) but there is no way you can more than likely avoid your place "smelling like a dog".  You could try some of those plug in air fresheners or some of those that will spray continuously.   That is the risk you run with adopting a dog and giving them a second chance at a loving forever home.<br>  <br>  If we are so "stupid and misinformed" then please feel free to explain away this:<br>  *1. Pit Bulls<br>  A pit bull is a fearless dog that will take on any opponent. They will lock their jaws onto the prey until it's dead. Pit bulls have a reputation of mauling people to death and they are highly sought for dog fighting.<br>  <br>  Weight: 55-65 lbs.<br>  Origin: United States<br>  <br>  Dogs most often make wonderful pets, however in certain circumstances, any type of dog can be dangerous. Even friendly dogs, can inflict great harm in the wrong circumstance.  <br>  As well as: ** American Pit Bull: This notoriously vicious dog is responsible for the most human deaths of any other dog in America.|`|DfiHyjcLaa	I agree with the above poster...almost ANY dog you get is going to "dirty" up your house to some degree...regardless of breed.<br>  <br>  Pit Bulls are very loving and loyal dogs, and since they have shorter coats, it won't be as bad..but your "nice clean" house WILL have dog hair around it.  You can clean every day and you'll still have dog hair somewhere.<br>  <br>  That being said, your house will only smell like dog if you don't keep the dog and his things clean, such as a bed or blanket he'll be using.  Keep baby wipes to wipe him down from time to time so you don't have to bathe him all the time.  Make sure you clean his paws off when he comes in from the outside, in case they're muddy or have salt on them in the winter.<br>  <br>  If you keep the dog itself clean you shouldn't notice any dirtiness too much - except dog hair.

AA10327148	Chihuahuas often get a bad rap, just as pit bulls and other breeds do. However, just as with the other breeds, it is the owner and not the breed. Far too many people neglect the *training and socialization* of their Chihuahuas. They are so small that they don't seem like they would do much harm, so the owner doesn't bother to train them in good manners. Sometimes the owner even thinks that their aggressiveness is"cute" and encourages it! <br>  <br>  <br>  I LOVE Chihuahuas, and have a little darling myself. He is well mannered, loves my toddler granddaughter, and is a pleasure to live with.  <br>  <br>  If you get a Chihuahua, please be diligent in his training and socialization. Also, be *consistent* with his potty training. Don't get one unless you, or someone, will be home most of the day with him, as these little guys need to be thoroughly housetrained from the beginning.|`|AA10283080	I like the ones that are trained properly.<br>  <br>   Rats bond with their owners and make excellent pets....so calling a chihuahua a rat isn't as much of an insult as people think.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I LOVE chihuahuas. They are the best dog ever!! Nothing like a rat. I hate rats and would not own one. Lifelong lover and owner of chihuahuas. A well bred chihuahuas may not have any health problems and often live well into the teen years and many times into the 20's. Any dog can have health problems no matter what the breed, but chihuahuas live much longer than a lot of breeds do.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	I like any breed of dogs, as long as they are friendly and well mannered.  Chihuahuas can have a LOT of health issues, especially if you buy one from a Pet Store or a local back yard breeder (from the newspaper or online).  They need to be well socialized when they are puppies because they can be very weary of people.  It can also be difficult to potty train them (most smaller dogs have more trouble learning) so you will need to devote a lot of time to them.  Chihuahuas can become extremely anxious when left alone, so it probably wouldn't be the best breed to leave in a cage all day when at work or school.<br>  <br>  I would really look into the breed, there is no *EASY* dog.  Make sure you know all the expenses and responsibilities of owning a dog before you look into getting one.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for an easier dog, think about adopting an older (young, over 2 years old or an adult) dog from the shelter.  They are already fixed and housebroken.|`|xEyyFrPhaa	i love chihuahuas especially the long coated ones they are not so grumpy as the smooth coated ones my sister has 3 long coated chihuahuas a 11 year old girl tricky voo (spayed), a 10 month old boy timmy voo, and a 6 month old boy bailey.<br>  <br>  i use to have a long coated chihuahua she was 20 years old when she died last april, now i have two mini long haired dachshunds (17 year old girl, and a nearly 2 year old boy) and a 13 year old sheltie, and i doggy sit the chihuahuas for my sister.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	I don't like them. I've never seen one that's friendly, the ones that I've come across are usually fresh.|`|tC2kzZmPaa	I don't particulary like them, but I've never had one so I'm not an expert. I've heard that they're susceptible to having health problems, which can be expensive - I think it's because they are such a highly-developed breed.<br>  <br>  I think the light coloured ones can look 'ratty' but the other colours are nicer. No pet is going to be 'easy' to maintain as they all need attention and the vet bills etc, but as this breed is very small I expect it would be easy to transport & house and so on.<br>  If yo're serious about wanting one then definitely do some researcha nd check them out!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!! :D|`|giBfNMX6aa	I just love dogs - I don't have a Chihuahua, but I do think they are cute.

O0AfxH9Eaa	He's possibly a bit lonely so talking to himself. One of my cats used to do this for no reason that I could see, and stopped, again for no obvious reason. Don't worry about the hyperactive thing: that's cats! especially kittens.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	he may just want attention or chaseing something|`|DtkLsetkaa	Sounds like hes just having kitten play time, but have you thought about getting him a friend?  Kittens are so much happier with a playmate, and it gets them out of your hair so to speak for a bit each day, plus there is nothing cuter than 2 kittens playing together.  Just something to think about that will probably calm him down a bit ;)|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	If he's very young, it may just be that he is still a "baby".  I have had a new kitten for 3 months now and I can tell a difference now that she is a little older.  Yes, she still follows me around the house all the time, but she isn't as vocal.  However, she still plays and jumps a lot.  Wish I had that much energy!|`|AA10936767	Kittens are not so bright. They are still developing mentaly and physicaly.

NYzCYCmJaa	I would say use it as a last resort.  I use one on my lab mix, (yes I did try it on myself first) because of her aggression.  I have spent about $10,000 in training for her she is a great dog just hate other dogs.  I would say that if you have to use it then find a trainer in your area that specializes in it and have them help you that is what I did. I used a company called SIT MEANS SIT and they are a little pricey but worth it.  If you have any questions about the collar or the training feel free to e-mail me LAWOEBER@yahoo.com|`|QLopvWKDaa	I really do not want to post a negative answer, but I have patterned most of my Yorkie's training after the advice of Victoria Stilwell from the show "It's me or the Dog".  <br>  <br>  Yorkies are also know for being very stubborn!<br>  <br>  She has said many times that shock collars and electronic fences are inhumane.<br>  <br>  Try watching her show, go to a training class with Bulldog in tow or get books on training and make it an enjoyable lesson for the both of you!  Good luck!|`|S5Lz35myaa	Personally, I would not use one, and we do not allow our students to use them.  Instead, enroll in a quality basic obedience class, and work with the instructors on regular chain slip collars.  Even bulldogs who can have trachea problems with collars can be taught on a slip collar, if the person doing it knows how.<br>  <br>  A shock collar may get a response the first time it's used.  However, it can also destroy the bond between the human and dog, can cause very serious emotional stress for the dog, and in some cases, the dog will listen when wearing the collar, but will also know when the collar is removed, so it is not trained to listen, it is only trained to listen when the collar is on.|`|uoaGIVsFaa	I would say research your breed, talk to other people with the same breed, and attend obedience/training classes before you get a shock collar.<br>  <br>  Also, talk to your vet. Your vet will know quite a bit about your breed! They could also answer any questions you have about this breed and maybe help you find other people who also have this breed. <br>  <br>  I have only seen shock collars used with people who hunt with their dogs. Other than that, I have never seen it on a regular household pet.<br>  But I do believe that people probably do use it. <br>  <br>  I would just ask that you research your breed, talk to other people with your breed, talk to your vet, and attend some obedience classes. Nothing major, just figuring out all your options before picking the shock collar as your solution!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|mJQheYGbaa	Oh my gosh these hippies are ridiculous.  I am currently using one as we speak for my dog; a no bark collar that shocks when he barks by sensing vibrations of his vocal cords (Not a controlled collar like you may be thinking about).   Their first argument - "It's cruel!! Try one and find out what it feels like!"<br>  <br>  Before that thing went around MY dog's neck, you better believe I tried it on myself.  Very rarely there are defective ones that can burn and blister skin.  So I tried it up to the third of six settings.  It's like dragging your feet along a fleece rug and getting a nice little shock touching a doorknob.  It's a SHOCK! No pain, but a sudden surprise that gets your attention.  These people have probably never actually tried one.<br>  <br>  So don't worry about it hurting your dog.  <br>  <br>  BUT...I would never suggest that any yoo-hoo just pull out a shock collar and start zapping their dog.  It must be used very carefully and precisely.  And a "punishment only" behavior modification is destined for failure.  You need to couple some positive reinforcement in their.  Either hire a trainer, or do some serious research about shock collars and dog training before you use one.  If you feel comfortable using one, and confident that any other techniques won't work, then don't be afraid of hurting your dog by trying one of these, cuz it won't happen.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	For what problem?  It's never appropriate for a "stubborn dog"  problem. What you need is a trainer that can teach you to work with your dog and find out what motivates him.  Negative reinforcement is not the best way to train.  Positive reinforcement is.|`|okAYAGvXaa	If used properly, they can be excellent tools for certain types of situation. Any kind of training collar can be "cruel" when used improperly.|`|FrqKyNdAaa	Definitely has the opportunity to be cruel.<br>  Perhaps you should first locate a trainer that has experience with the well known stubborn bull dog.|`|KlZPzzuBaa	It's been my experience that shock collars are not the best method for training. You have to meet stubborn with stubborn. Work on several small/short training sessions throughout the day instead of one long one. It'll take time, but anything worth doing usually does.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to pursue the e-collar, let me suggest (in the most honest way) that anyone controlling the device first try it themselves. I've seen too many owners throw the thing on and zap the crap out of their dogs because they have no idea what the collar is doing. Good luck!|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	No, no, no, no, no, no, no NO<br>  <br>  No shock collars.  They are cruel.<br>  <br>  Put it around you neck & see what your dog will feel.  You wouldn't do to him what you wouldn't do to yourself.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	A shock collar can be an effective tool if used by someone who knows what they are doing, for a specific issue, for a specific dog.  <br>  If used improperly or by an inexperienced person, or for the wrong situation, or on the wrong dog. it can be a form of torture and will not solve anything and actually create more problems.  <br>  <br>  From your question, I am assuming your dog is being "stubborn" in general.  You just need to find his motivation.  Get a good trainer to help you. Don't even think about a shock collar right now.  If after you have tried everything else, AND your trainer thinks it is the only option (and I would get a couple different opinions on this) Then you can get them to teach you how to make specific corrections for the specific problems.<br>  <br>  Bull Dogs were bred to be stoic, with a high pain tolerance.  This type of dog can be resistant to negative corrections and appear "stubborn"  Positive reinforcement training may work better for him.  Find a trainer who is experience with different type dogs.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Gee, your bulldog is stubborn?  That's a shocker.  <br>  <br>  English bulldogs are known to be stubborn.  They require a lot of patience to train and ... if you start shocking the dog, it will probably have the opposite affect and may even make him aggressive.<br>  <br>  Go get a good book on English Bulldogs, read, read, read.  Learn to understand your breed.  Then find a good trainer that can help you out.|`|OxFsslN8aa	I had a one year old golden retriever puppy who would not come to myself or my husband for anything; treats, toys, praise - nothing.  We enrolled in obedience classes, had trainers come to the house; nothing worked for him.  The trainer came with a shock collar & at first my husband and I wouldn't even consider it but she assured us this was our last option.  We put it on him & the trainer had the controller while my husband and I were in the yard with treats asking our dog to come.  He wouldn't move.  She shocked him on the lowest setting & he immediately went under a very heavy old canoe; we said "come" and he didn't move. She shocked him again at the next level & he lifted that canoe off the ground (it weighed roughly 120 lbs) and stayed put.  We said "come" one more time and he came out from under the canoe and sat for his treat.  My husband called & he came to him.  After that day we never ever had a problem with him coming.  He lived to 10 years old & we never ever had an issue with obedience.  It was hard for me to watch but was glad a professional was there.  He had a great life out on walks, trail hiking & going to parks once he would listen to "come".  I now have two puppies & they don't need an e-collar.  It was my last resort and I think I was lucky that the outcome was as good as it was considering what can happen to dogs that are shocked.  It isn't for every dog or for every problem but it did help with ours.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	The e-collar IS NOT a training method, it is a training tool.<br>  Collar conditioning is far to labor intensive to use one for simple O/B training.<br>  <br>  Before buying an e-collar, a person needs to buy a video on how to use one.<br>  <a href="http://www.totalretriever.com/ecollar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalretriever.com/ecollar.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dobbsdogs.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=13_88&products_id=513" rel="nofollow">http://www.dobbsdogs.com/catalog/index.p...</a>|`|ac92f82f4d5b3f3af2d01d0117d482cbaa	Shock collars...hmmm...<br>  <br>  They are best used on the youths of today.<br>  <br>   I see no need for a shock collar on any dog I have.

How long has it been?  If she has not eaten or especially drank any water in a couple of days, then she needs to be checked out by a vet.  Sometimes if a dog's metabolism or electrolytes get off balance, they will act strangely.<br>  Some dogs become overly attached or even obsessed with a particular toy.  They do get obsession/compulsive disorder(OCD), just like people.  A vet could help with this too.  Your dog may need medications, like an anti-anxiety medication to help her until she improves or gets over the behavior.<br>  Did anything happen that could have scared her?  That could also have triggered her behavior.  <br>  I would do whatever you can to get her to eat or drink some water.  She needs to be checked out by a vet.  They could give you some answers to why she's acting the way she is and not eating or drinking water.  Best of luck to your dog.  Hope I helped.|`|AA11244754	honey, I am suspecting that she's is looking at the stuffed cow as her puppy mainly because she hasn't been spayed (neutering is for male dogs), this is a phase but I think it's an excellent idea to be on the safe side to get her to the vet and have him examine her and while you are there schedule her to be spayed.|`|AA10063059	its called a phantom pregnancy,to avoid get her spayed, i had a setter that used to suffer these|`|A2G9foewaa	I wouldn't worry to much unless it starts wondering around saying Yo Quiero Taco Bell|`|4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Very similar if not identical events happened with my mother's dog, in which he is a mix chihuahua / jack russel. Although, I will not help you in the solution, even though if it's anything like my mothers dog which it sounds like it, your dog is in desperate need of help or this may have a fatal result as it did with my mothers dog.<br>  <br>  The only reason I refuse to help is because you are not understanding of anything. You simply ask questions on Y!Answers in hopes that people will respond with things you want to hear. I gave you 25min. of my day today to help you and your boyfriends relationship, in hopes that you could both work it out and come to a reasonable and smart conclusion, only to see you did not take it into consideration, instead picking some dudes answer in which he typed out a 3-sentence answer consisting of how much you need to leave your boyfriend with no reason why, no facts as to why, no background, which I offered and concluded everything needed in order to contain a healthy relationship. Thus, making me believe you just wanted to hear someone say... "Leave him, he's a druggy!" So you had an excuse to leave him... "Hey babe, Y!Answers told me to leave you, bye! Now I can be a trashbag for mens cu... yeah..." <br>  <br>  Anyways. The answer to this question would require another 20 minutes of my day which I'm not willing to commit to you, therefore probably resulting in the possible death of your pet. No offense. But, I recommend you act on it quick! Or poor Munchi-Monster will be dead soon. By the way, you wonder why your boyfriend smokes bud? If I was dating such a one-minded broad like yourself, I would be smoking bud to! You seem like a straight controlling, attention needing, loser in life, not your boyfriend for smoking. Maybe you need some Ganja to open up some more to life, your boyfriend should be the one considering leaving you, not vise-versa.<br>  <br>  Wait, I want the best answer here, therefore I will give you the response you want... "Your dog will be fine ma'am..." there, pick me now, ok. =) Lmao.|`|jpqHCXXHaa	my dog did this,<br>  <br>  your dog thinks its cow is its baby, it cares for it like a mother would and when you take it away it whines, <br>  <br>  she should get used to it and grow out of it|`|wCMVBB6Naa	Well, is your dog going through the mating phase?

She had been living with her previous owner for almost 2 years so I assumed she just missed her old home. She eventually grew out of it but is still extremely clingy to me. Like she's always right there with me everywhere I go. If I leave the house and can't take her with me she gets really sad and when I come back she's waiting by the door for me. I've only had her for 4 months so I'm hoping that she will grow out of this stage like she did the last one within the next couple months. <br>  <br>  If you love her I would just give her a little more time. She probably just misses her old home. Hopefully over time she will become more used to it and understand that your house is her home now.

CdRlOsnyaa	here are some problems that erlate to what your turtle had <br>  <br>  Skin infection <br>  This will appear as, but not be limited to, excessive shedding skin, sores and sometimes a general foul smell. This condition, left untreated, can result in septicemia<br>  <br>  RED- ORANGE tint on turtle <br>  Seeing red or pink. orangish coming through the plastron or going along the scutes of the carapace, usually indicate Septicemia, but not always. It is not uncommon for younger turtles to have a slight pinkish or faded rust-colored appearance on the plastron. This eventually goes away in time and is of no health concern. Having a red or pink tint to the skin can sometimes be an indicator of indicate Septicemia, but not always. Also check the temperature of your habitat's water and basking areas <br>  <br>  so it sounds like your turtle a infection that lead to blood diseas. did you have all the essentials? <br>  <br>  Turtle dock with UVA/UVB light basking temperture 85-90 degrees<br>  <br>  CLEAN water at a temperture of 78-80 degrees<br>  <br>  a good filter to prevent chlorine build up and stop infections due to messy enclosure <br>  <br>  a varied diet of veggies and meats. <br>  <br>  To be safe throw out those fish you have in the tank with them
qeOlkRM0aa	You didn't give a link, so i can't tell.<br>  What you want with live sand, is for ir to be as fresh as possible. Some places sell it that is harvested like live rock is.

You can use regular sand for the bulk, and seed it with live sand.|`|9c244bfee8268997c7b51bbd821a11f2aa	I agree with Zola, "live sand" is crap.  It's just sand with a little pouch of live organisms to add to your water. Don't spend the money. Just get normal sand and then buy a bottle of microrganisms to get your tank started.

L22hVXTIaa	You're right, she is homesick and a little confused.  Her surroundings have completely changed and she's a little anxious.  As long as the other members of her pack (your family) are there, she will be fine.  It's only been a few days and all the sights, smells, etc. are new and a little scary - especially for a young dog.  Just be sure to bring in her bed, toys, dishes, etc. as well as other things from the old house and she'll start to feel comfortable soon enough.  Just reassure her - take her for walks to get the feel of the new neighborhood and she'll come 'round.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It was nice that you told us the age of your puppy, it would have helped to know the breed.  You are right that she is stressed with the new move and new surroundings.  She needs to be reassured.  I would quit forcing her to look out the window, you are just stressing her more.  I would allow her to explore on her own.  When we move, we unload the dogs things first, their pillows, blankets, food and water dishes, toys bones, so it is less stress on them.  We try and put our furniture in about the same place, and stick to their schedules as much as possible.  It is hard to answer without knowing the breed.|`|9kTejB0uaa	She's just unsettled and worried about what's going on.  But don't worry, she'll settle down - moving dogs is usually much easier than moving cats which are 'place oriented'.  As long as the food arrives on schedule, and the bed is there - and you are around, making reassuring noises, dogs usually adapt to new surrounds well.  And actually mine (and we have moved A LOT) enjoy a change of scenery. <br>  <br>  She may well be picking up on your vibes.  Moving isn't easy and you are probably well stressed!<br>  <br>  Just get into her previous routine, mealtimes, walks etc. - cut her some slack, loads of reassurance, and she'll be fine.  I hesitate to suggest you put a few drops of Rescue Remedy into her water?  I'm not entirely convinced about how well this works, but others swear by it and it might be worth a try.|`|io3lMQgFaa	She is a little stressed about the new place, but you've only been there for a few days...she'll get more and more used to it with time.  Make sure she has familiar things around her in the meantime.  As for the car, or any other place that you want her to go with ease eventually, don't force her in the car, and don't place her there yourself when she shows hesitance; this will make it a bad experience for her.  Instead, get in the car yourself, hold out her favorite treat, and call her in (having her on a leash and gently tugging may help) and once she's in, praise her with the treat and "good girl!!"  Hope this helps.  :)|`|8gpvkxcvaa	She's nervous about her new home.  The smells are all different and she has not scouted out her new turf yet.  She will be just fine as long as you have familiar things to her such as her sleeping area, toys, blankets and of course her family.  After all dogs don't know there dogs, they often think they are people too.  I adopted a puppy that was about 10 weeks old and since he was unfamiliar with our home, he whimpered around for the 1st couple of days.  But to find out, all he needed was his own space with his own things in it.  I bought him a portable dog crate and he ran inside and happily went to sleep.

hl4kkvXhaa	Well, the problem is, the de-worming medicines they sell in the pet sections of the store do not treat all types of worms, and if you use it on the wrong type, you can actually do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  No more milk!  Despite what we all learned as kids, milk can't be digested properly by adult cats, and will cause diarrhea and sometimes vomiting...which will cause dehydration, and can make his fever worse.<br>  <br>  Take your cats to the vet.  Most likely, if one cat has worms, they will both have them.  It's just that your second cat is probably in earlier stages, so the symptoms aren't there yet.  The vet will be able to tell you the type of worms they have, and give you the medicine to treat them.  Here is a link that might help you narrow down what type of worms your cats have <a href="http://www.natural-pet-care.com/natural-pet-health-blog/category/cats-kittens/worms-fleas-parasites-cats/" rel="nofollow">http://www.natural-pet-care.com/natural-...</a> but I still recommend a vet if you have never used home remedies because worms are serious in pets and some types can be transmitted between pets and humans.<br>  <br>  As for the fever, heat is actually going to make it worse.  You need to get rid of the heat, and the CPU is actually making it worse.  Until you can get kitty to the vet, you need to give your kitty a 10 minute cool water bath or (if the cat won't let you bathe it), try using cool compresses on its belly.  But, fever can be a sign of severe illness, so your kitty still needs to see a vet as soon as possible.  The compresses or bath are just to cool him/her down while waiting for the appointment.  <a href="http://kitchen.robbiehaf.com/PetHomeRemedies.html" rel="nofollow">http://kitchen.robbiehaf.com/PetHomeReme...</a><br>  <br>  Hope your kitty starts to feel better soon!|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	You are going to have to take it to the vet.

Homemade vetting usually ends up in the condition worsening and sometimes death of the animal due to poisoning or overdose.  Most human meds are toxic to cats so don't give your cat any medicine the vet doesn't approve. Fever will probably call for antibiotics and a fecal exam will tell what kind of worms your kitty has so the vet can give the right medicine to treat them.|`|bdc0b0f0724a4bf1ba102444af8d0705aa	your best bet is to take your cat to the vet immediately.  Also bring the worm with you to the vet, so the vet knows what kind of worms the cat has.  do not give the cat some home remedy.|`|aws17QoYaa	take him to the vet unless you are a registered veterinarian which i doubt you are because you are asking this question|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Hmmm I'd have to say you HAVE to take the cat to the vet.  If you have more pets the worms can infect them too if your cat has worms.  Certain worms even people can get, from what I've heard.  Be careful...and you say you cannot afford to take your cat to the vet, but can you afford to NOT take him/her to the vet?  If you have pets, you should always be prepared to take them in when they get sick or hurt just like a human being.  They need routine visits too for shots, and appointments to make sure they don't get things like worms.  I am pretty sure the de-worming medications that you need you can only get from a vet clinic.  I really think you need to take your poor cat to the vet.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  I really really agree with what Pretty Kitty has to say...
gU34xa9vaa	No you should never ever use human medicines for cats as they have different types of worms,apart from the fact that most humans medicine is poisonous to cats. Always get wormers from the vets for your kitten.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	NO - take your cat to the vet for the proper dosage for the type of worms he/she may have.<br>  <br>  In fact, I would never use any dewormer on a child or a pet - always use the doctor!|`|ISjFdI1taa	NO - definitely not.<br>  Kids deworming stuff usually only kills threadworm anyway, so it wouldn't work and would probably make your cat very ill.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	No.  Human and cat systems are very different.  Most human medications are toxic to cats and can cause organ damage if not death.

Go get some for the pet store.|`|cj31x3UMaa	While Strongid is a wormer that is commonly used for both humans & cats, you need to know what kind of worms a cat has before dosing it willy nilly.<br>  <br>  Different worms/parasites, different medications & in quite a few cases they are the exact same (different doses) as the medication used for humans.<br>  <br>  Take a stool sample to the vet for testing & find out what type of worms your cat has. If the vet is prepared to perscribe the medication you already have, then you just need to know the correct dosage.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	good heavens no. For a start off the dosage will be completely wrong. Secondly, cats get a different range of worms. And thirdly, cats have completely different innards to humans. Get advice from your vet, the first time. After that you can buy worm tablets online, cheaper than at the vet. In any case your cat is due for neutering if it hasn't already been done, so you can get the worm tablets at the same time.|`|FDdUMtqlaa	do you mean dewormer if so here you go, No human and animals usually don't have the same type or worms and wormer, you should just go to the vet to just be on the safe side and get the right wormer for cats you will find out how Much to give it by weight|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	No way.

Yours doesn't, so please delete it.<br>  <br>  [jeff h]:<br>  You DON'T have a "German Shepard". LEARN that our breed's first function is herding and so the English translation of its breed-name is the German Shepherd Dog. Some of the "experts" who replied had equally ignorant spellings of the breed, so obviously they don't even know what the breed is FOR.<br>  <br>  Whether you should worry about the tilt depends on whether it is her normal position, or just happens when she is "thinking".<br>  <br>  If it is her normal position then a vestibular disorder is the most likely cause. Basically, that means an  infection in the balance centre of her "inner ear", or an inflammation of the lining of her brain. It is almost impossible to get antibiotics to the site in either case, and so treatment is not easy or quick. Even mites living at the base of the outer ear are damned hard to get rid of. On the brighter side, some forms of vestibular disorders clear up spontaneously.<br>  ? If her tilt IS permanent, have the vet check her thoroughly, either now if it seems to be a problem for her, or (if she continues to be happy & well-balanced) make a point of mentioning it when the vet checks her before the first vaccination.<br>  ? If she is perfectly happy and has the full range of normal head movement but just tilts her head to one side now and then (which will usually be when she is encountering & "thinking about" something new), no worries. Just as we can focus both our eyes onto the same spot and can move our head around to help us do visual "rangefinding", so a dog can focus its ears for sound "rangefinding". But at 5 weeks a pup won't have fine control of its ears - could well not even be able to erect them yet - so uses its whole head to help "get a bearing" on a wanted sound or to "tune out" one sound and enable it to better listen to a sound coming from a different direction.<br>  <br>  To get more information about possible inner ear infections, search for "vestibular" and then for "ear" in the [Veterinary site search] part of <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_GSD_Source/links/Diseases_001198817153/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...</a><br>  <br>  And avoid the know-it-all kids pretending to be experienced adults - join some of the 300+ YahooGroups dedicated to various aspects of living with GSDs, and ask your questions in appropriate groups.

SnAsZapMaa	It is impossible for you to have a German Shepard - there is no such task as ARDing, and so no breed was developed to perform it.<br>  As you obviously don't know that the GSD breed was developed to HERD sheep in the German boundary-patrolling way, and so has the breed-name German Shepherd Dog, you should NOT be letting your bit.ch get mated - without knowing the breed's functions you cannot wisely choose breeding partners.<br>  And anyone who has to ask breeding questions here (instead of asking their mentor or the breeder of their bit.ch or the people in their GSD club) obviously doesn't have anything breed-worthy. So once the pup is weaned, please book your dog & bit.ch in for neutering.<br>  <br>  No, I have never had a pup that made me think it was blind in one eye.<br>  But there are eye disorders around that can produce early blindness. The "juvenile night blindness" version of PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy) is one of them. But I would expect it to affect BOTH eyes, not just one. So the most likely culprit is a physical injury.<br>  <br>  You give us no evidence about WHY you think the pup might be blind in one eye.<br>  So I cannot even START guessing at what the cause might be.<br>  Your question is equivalent to e-mailing "I'm sick. Send the cure." to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Testing for a blink reflex is the easiest way to check for blindness, whether unilateral or bilateral.<br>  <br>  In <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_GSD_Source/links/Diseases_001198817153/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...</a> you will find many useful links.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	What will work best is scruffing her (grasping the loose, thick skin behind her head and above her shoulderblades), hissing, giving a very LIGHT shake, and saying no.  Do this every time she bites.  You can also warn her off (if she shows obssessive interest in an area) by saying 'ahh'.  If she still bites, scruff.<br>  Make sure to praise her, as well.  If she sniffs an area that she usually bites, but doesn't or turns away, give her verbal praise.  If you can pick her up without getting bit, praise her.  If you can give her a kiss without getting nipped, praise.  You might have to turn around 5 seconds later and discipline her, but that quick moment of acknowledging her GOOD behavior is essential.<br>  <br>  The spray and ointments should be used as a very *last* resort (say if you tried everything for months and months and nothing works)--not really as a starting out measure (discipline and rules actually help you bond with ferrets--just like any animal).<br>  <br>  If you are consistent with both the discipline and the affection, it will work.  With both of my biters, it took about 2 months to completely train them out of nipping (or, in some cases, out and out biting).  Now, they are my undisputed lap-hogs :)<br>  <br>  (p.s.--if you just got her a bit ago, has she been checked for earmites?  These little parasites cause ferrets a lot of pain and discomfort [which makes them bite, and much HARDER, too].  If not, it's important she get checked out and treated.  Most ferrets that come from pet stores and shelters do have them).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	What works best for me is putting a finger in the mouth of the biting ferret, and holding the ferrets heat to keep it there for a few seconds...they hate it.

Sit in on your knee and put the bottle to its lips. Whilst its drinking run its throat continuously to make sure the milk goes down. And if this is what the previous owner has been feeding it, don't change the diet as its unsettling for the stomach. When it is older (not sure how much older) Gradually add other food( not sure what type) just a little bit at a time, as well the milk. As time goes on, it should want less milk and more of its other food. Hope this helps.|`|VybYClAHaa	You usually bottle feed to about 7 or 8 weeks, go to your local pet supply store, where they sell hay and pig stuff, they also sell a milk replacement with bottles and different size nipples. the bag of milk replacement will explain everything if not just ask someone that works their. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
zqVDJxUIaa	It's the same as keeping it anywhere else. However, if it's in a public place, get a aquarium hood which is lockable, to prevent some dumb person from reaching in to touch the fish. You never know, some people actually might do that... Also, make sure you place it in a place which does not have lights on 24 hours a day, since fish need about 8 hours of dark each day.<br>  Good Luck!
xeQdPUzhaa	I had an Am Staff that was 6 when he was diagnosed with Cushing's, and he had a wonderful and full life.  He lived to be 13.  I must say that until you get a firm diagnosis, the thought of euthanasia is slightly drastic to say the least.  With testing you can find out what is really going on, and if it is Cushing's, your vet will try different medications until you find one that works for your dog.  My dog was happy and led a full life on his meds.  Don't stress too much, you just have to be patient and willing to take the extra time to care for your animal child.|`|cnZlMojUaa	I know you are nervous. It is right to get the dog tested. If the disease is caught early, it stands to reason it will respond better to treatment.<br>  <br>  For the moral booster: I had a dog that exhibited far more symptoms than your dog does.

But still, hope for the best.<br>  <br>  Our symptoms included excessive thirst, increased liver enzyme, pot-belly appearance, seeking out cool tile floors to lay on, and increased appetite. Her hair loss was primarily on the tummy area. Good luck Thursday. The test really isn't stressful or hard for the dog. Please give us an update.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	First, calm down. You don't know it's Cushing's yet and even if it is, you still don't know what type. Second, you may want to have another thyroid panel done, and this time send the sample to Dr. Jean Dodds' Hemopet. Hemopet will run a more thorough analysis than most vets do as well as have the sample analyzed by Dr. Dodds who is an expert at diagnosing hypothyroidism. I would doubt Cushing's if for no other reason than she isn't eating or drinking any more than usual. I had a dog on prednisone for awhile (high doses mimic cushing's symptoms) and he drank and peed constantly, was always hungry, was rather lethargic (except when there was even a remote possibility of getting food), had mood swings, and had a pot-belly. Whatever the outcome, I hope your girl is alright and that whatever she has is easily treated.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You're borrowing problems here.  You don't even know that it's Cushions yet.  So, wait till you get the right diagnosis before you start looking at how best to treat the dog.<br>  <br>  Secondly, even with a diagnosis, their is not set time for a dog to live.  The attitude to take is that you'll keep the dog around until a time when it's quality of life is so bad that it doesn't make sense to do so anymore.<br>  <br>  But for right now, try to relax and wait till you have a proper diagnosis.  Take the dog for a walk.

Expect your dog to have good days and bad days.Continue to love your dog as always.Your dog will let you know when it is time for you to make the most difficult decision of your life."Euthanasia is the ultimate loving act for our beloved companion animals.It is for them,regardless of the effects on us, that we must do this."

Cushing's disease is a disorder of the adrenal glands, a pair of inch long kidney bean shaped glands situated just above the kidneys. Their function is to manufacture and secrete potent hormones directly into the blood stream to facilitate and regulate a whole bunch of bodily processes.<br>  <br>  There are about 30 or more hormones secreted by the adrenal glands, among them is a very important one called cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone that is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, the maintenance of normal blood sugar levels, muscle development and other functions related to tissue growth and repair.<br>  <br>  Cortisol is also an important part of a dog's "fight or flight" response. In any stressful situation a dog may face, these glands push more cortisol into the blood stream, which in turn releases stored energy, which can be used to face, whatever situation the dog is under. Whether it is a threat of an oncoming confrontation, an infection or a physical challenge such as surgery or other illnesses.<br>  <br>  Under normal conditions, the amount of cortisol that is sent into the blood stream is controlled by another tiny oval gland called the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of a dog's brain. The pituitary gland's job is to send a message to the adrenal glands via a hormone called "adrenocorticotropic" (ACTH) when it needs cortisol, when it has enough it stops sending ACTH.<br>  <br>  Cushing's disease happens when the excessive secretion of cortisol is not stopped, which can be fatal to the dog.<br>  <br>  There are two reasons why this happens and both reasons boil down to cancer. The most common one is a tiny slow growing benign cancer located in the pituitary gland. This cancer is so small that is barely takes up any room and it does not press on anything, however it causes an excessive amount ACTH to be sent to the adrenal glands, which in turn causes the glands to grow bigger and produce more cortisol.<br>  <br>  This condition known as "pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease is the cause of about ninety percent of the Cushing's disease cases. Interestingly enough, most of these cases are small breed dogs.<br>  <br>  The cure for this type of cancer is the use of drugs, as trying to remove the growth is not possible because the pituitary gland is inaccessible. So the treatment is directed to the adrenal glands. Radiation will not work and so drugs are used, this is a form of chemotherapy, once you start, the treatment goes on forever in order to control the disease. Depending on the dog's response, treatment will require weekly treatments and monthly checks by the vet to see what the cortisol levels are. Most dogs will respond to this treatment and have an extended life.<br>  <br>  The other ten percent of these cases are due to cancer in the adrenal glands. Fifty percent of the time the tumor is benign and the other fifty- percent of the time the tumor is malignant. The tumor grows and causes the gland to produce more cortisol<br>  <br>  The benign cases can be treated, the malignant ones do not respond to radiation or chemotherapy, as the amount of drugs necessary would cause unacceptable side effects. If the malignant cancer has not spread to other parts of the body, it is possible to remove it surgically. Unfortunately, by the time this type of Cushing's disease is diagnosed, it is too late to perform surgery,<br>  <br>  What are the signs of Cushing's disease you should be aware of? If your dog suddenly starts to drink a great deal of water and is urinating frequently, these are classic signs to be aware of. Granted they may be signs of other problems, too, but I would take my dog to the vet, as soon as I noticed these two particular signs.<br>  <br>  A dog with Cushing's disease will also develop a large appetite due to the effect the cortisol has on the insulin in the body. Periods of panting and nervousness, which may include constant pacing, may also be noticed. The dog's muscles will become weak and the dog maybe prone to falling, which can cause injuries to the knees, hips and other joints.<br>  <br>  A sign of advanced Cushing's disease is a potbelly. What is happening, is the cortisol is telling the body to break down fat and to deliver it to the liver for processing. The liver can only process so much and the access is stored and the end result is a "pot belly."<br>  <br>  Another sign of advanced Cushing's disease is the loss of hair. The hair loss is not random; it will appear on both sides of the body or on the insides of the thighs. It will not itch, as the hair loss is the cause of too much cortisol, however, if it does itch for some reason, your dog may also have a skin infection.<br>  <br>  Cushing's disease is usually found in dogs that are middle-aged or older. Small dogs such as Cocker Spaniels and poodles are usually between the ages of eight and ten, while larger dogs show signs around the ages of five to six years of age.<br>  <br>  Cortisol plays such a significant role in so many bodily functions, with a vast range of ser

Sorry for the loss of your pet.|`|se27sAUwaa	That is definitely something you should have asked your Vet BEFORE putting your kitty down. There are so many different situations that this could happen in, with the small amount of info you gave no one would be able to correctly diagnose. I have to trust that your Vet is a stand-up person (hopefully), so whatever the problem was it must have been severe enough to warrant this decision. You should call your Vet and just ask them if they could explain again what exactly the problem was. It's understandable that during your time of grief you forget to ask certain things, I know I always get flustered at the doctors and then when I leave I realize there was 99 things I forgot to ask. I just really hope that euthanizing was the correct decision. It would be a shame to put down a loving animal b/c it's owner may not have asked or understood everything the Vet was saying.

The splash by her eye does appear gray which would make her a blue-cream or a blue-tortie or a dilute tortie - depending on the registry terminology.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If she is bluecream- the colors come in slower as they are paler then a tortie.<br>  <br>  What color are the parents?|`|4aAhEK9daa	I don't see any red (orange) or brown in this cat's coat to make her Tortie.  I thought in that first pic it looked like the right side of her face was a creamy red in the other pic it looks white.  I'd call her a Blue Mitt since she has dark gray (blue) and mitts (white paws).<br>  <br>  Did you buy her from a breeder selling TICA or CFA registered cats?  If so then he or she should have told you the colour.  In fact, I think they put it on her paperwork.  And if you didn't buy her from a reputable breeder odds are she isn't a full blooded Ragdoll.<br>  <br>  I have a Seal Mink Tortie and White Ragamuffin.  You can see the creamy orange on the right side of her face is pretty obvious:<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-ta5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-ta6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-...</a><br>  <br>  If you Google Ragdoll you'll see tons of pics - <a href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&q=ragdoll" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=...</a>  Note, though, that only the pics on breeder sites may truly be Ragdolls.  A lot of people ASSUME their cats are Ragdoll simply because they have pointed markings and a bit longer coat.

JGq9rKBOaa	You run on the sidewalk? Good luck with your OWN joints! I can't run on anything harder than dirt trails before my ankles start killing me, even with all sorts of "high tech" sneakers =p<br>  <br>  But I digress!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about his joints, or at least not worry more about sidewalks than about any other exercise, but obviously, just be alert for any signs that he's in pain. Most dogs who end up with joint problems seem to be genetically predisposed to them - hip dysplasia, arthritis - and it has little to do with what sort of exercise they do. I had a dog who started getting arthritic at about age 6, and that was just poor breeding. If he seems sore after a run, maybe cut down on the distance or start running trails instead.<br>  <br>  The thing about running with dogs is getting them used to running at your pace....I tried to run with my Sheltie a few times, and while her "trot" pace was pretty much a pace I could run at, she'd see ME running and get excited and start running at full speed and tripping me with the leash. I'm sure I could have trained her to be a better running partner, but it didn't really seem worth the effort!|`|MLC97M1Baa	I think he should be fine. But check with your vet and see. If you are up to ii, get x rays done to see if his plates have finished closing. That is what some agility folk do so they know they can start weave pole training. <br>  I have the same valid concern with my Border Collie who is 10 months. I would like to run with him in the summer and take him on bike rides, etc. He has been running in the park and been coming on hikes as well, but I am hestitant to bring it to the pavement.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	At 1.5 years he is probably done growing vertically, so it should be safe. Most of the concern about running long distances on pavement is for puppies, especially large breeds that are still growing. Like I said though, yours would be considered in the "safe zone" at his age. If it really worries you, talk to your vet and watch for signs of discomfort like lameness after runs, lagging behind you, decreased stamina, reluctance to run, etc.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I don't know if you live in a big city where there isn't grass on both sides of the side walk, but if you don't you could run him where he stays in the grass, and isn't on the hard surface at all times.  If you do live in a concrete city try taking him a time a two and see how he does. Also could ask your vet.|`|eDySIDPQaa	You are risking both of you getting joint problems, and you yourself can end up with shinsplints, that is what runners can it when your ankles and mid shin part begins to get really sore and stays that way,<br>  <br>  that is from running on concrete all the time,,,try to switch off to grass like every 2-3 days and then back to concrete........<br>  <br>  If you have a large park around you, run the grass, but then you run the chance of hitting hole and you will go down...just be careful..<br>  <br>  I run 2 miles per day, 1 mile out on concrete and back on grass, I split it up.....there is grass all around us, and we have a runners path, so on the way back we run the path, till just before we get back and finish the last couple blocks on concrete again.<br>  <br>  good luck, but just concrete all the time, you will begin to feel the pressure in your joints as well...<br>  <br>  dogs fully develop between  18-24 mos, so I introduce the dog slowly to the concrete running.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Running or jogging of any kind on any kind of surface is considered a high impact sport. Keep that in mind. They don't call it high impact for nothing.This is for both you and your dog.<br>  <br>  If you concerned about our dog's joints or bones and want to give him exercise, then take him swimming. That is totally no impact.<br>  <br>  Consider taking and givng to your dog Gloucosamine, MSN and Chrondoitin. Those will help a lot of arthritis and bone disease throughout your life. <br>  <br>  One of the benefits of running on concrete is wearing down the dog's nails. But it also will wear down the pad. Definitely check your dog's pads regularly to cuts and stones and thorns.|`|np6W9hnsaa	Just an idea? I don't know about your sidewalk, but around where I live (suburbia-ville!) we have a layer of grass next to the sidewalk before you go into the road. You could try training him to run on the grass rather than the sidewalk. Take a leash and run with him and click/treat when he's running on the grass, then add vocal.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Think of it this way ... running on the pavement won't increase his chances of joint problems any more than it will yours.  And you'll have to live a lot longer than the dog.<br>  <br>  Dogs can do fine running on asphault and pavement and ... you'll probably never have to trim toe nails again!!  It keeps them ground down very nicely.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	I have a 2 yr old bc that loves to roller blade with my daughter, so I suppliment with glucloseamine and chondroitin to help protect young joints.

Fc1qkfHJaa	How old is she?  I personally like the dog trainer Cesar Millan, so see if you can watch his show the dog whisperer or read his books, because they are really helpful.  You need to train her a lot, try starting with putting her in a harness, so that she can't get out of it.  Keep your shoulders back and head up and be assertive.  Also be patient.  Set aside some time to spend with her.  Good luck!

iz03uvV4aa	Personally - depending on circumstances of course - assuming that it was a little cow kick and a little buck to retaliate, I would "ride her through it".  I would just keep riding, and continue the lesson.  This teaches my horse that no matter what, the lesson is going to go on regardless of the temper tantrum.  However, I would also want to know the root cause of the "bucking" issue if this was a continuous behavioural problem.  I would be sure to check my horses back, saddle fitting if need be consult a chiro practor. Otherwise, I would be working my horse through it with no rewards after the action.  The lesson will go on with a buck or no buck.  Its ultimatley easier for my horse to school quietly than to buck and make a fuss. They will catch on eventually.  <br>  <br>  Happy Riding! =)|`|5TCewPYRaa	Pull the head up and kick the horse forward---no stopping as thats what they want to do when they buck--ride em through it!|`|KeQOHakpaa	in most cases of bucking i just ride through it, making the horse do what was asked of them so they understand that just because they bucked, it doesn't mean that they aren't going to do what i told them to. now if the horse is bucking a lot, as in it just bucks and bucks and bucks even after i've been trying to ride through it, it then becomes time to kick some butt. especially once the bucking is becoming dangerous, i will hop off, and take my crop and slap them on the shoulder a couple of times. (please note, that this is not me abusing my animals, this is just me looking out for my sake so i don't get hurt or worse. believe me, the only time i ever do this is after a multitude of sessions as a last resort, and the horse is still bucking in order to try to get out of working. and the slaps are no worse than what you would see a person doing when their horse refuses a jump, i only hop off to get better leverage and to keep myself from getting thrown in case the horse reacts negatively.) though riding through bucking is the best way to correct a bucking horse, and while riding through it i always try to keep the horses head up high and i sit back on my rump to better push the horse's hind end down.<br>  <br>  grrr, puppypavillion, get off of here. little troll|`|3wIZiZA5aa	I back my horse up, turn in him in circles, and make him woah until he licks his lips. Then I keep riding like nothing happened, and he usually doesn't try to buck again. If he does, I just repeat my method and it works!|`|d2Obe0aJaa	Depends on why my horse is bucking. Typically I'll pull their head up, tugging hard on one rein, a horse can't buck with their head up. Usually I'll do that and then stop the horse to see whats wrong. If the horse keeps it up then I'll make them lope tiny circles, a horse shouldn't buck. <br>  Sometimes you can tell before a horse gets ready to buck, if its a older horse, then when they start to put their head down like that then I'll tug on one rein.|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	It would depend why they bucked. It can be a sign of pain or not understanding. My sister's cob is lazy and used to buck if you used a schooling stick on him - not hard, just to back up your leg. The general response was he got another tap and he soon learnt it wasn't acceptable, however this was only done after making sure he had no pain anywhere or from tack. <br>  My approach to a youngster would be different as they may be bucking from sheer excitement to which I would reprimand with my voice to start with. I would also push the horse forward with their head up as this makes it harder for them to buck and if they still bucked I would probably go back to lunging.<br>  <br>  It varies a lot between different horses and will depend on the reason but as a general rule I see no point in hitting a horse hard as this is more likely to make them worse not better.|`|ZGiVn4MUaa	depends on how the bucks feel....somtimes horses buck cuz there in pain or there scared if u have a older horse who is sudenly bucking i say check c if there bck is out nd check the saddle nd cinch...most time colts buck cuz there scared smiple do so much ground work nd u wont have very much bucking or if the colt is jus a bronco well then take him to a deep dam nd get on him nd run him in the water....or b a cowgirl nd jus ride him till he stops bucking that normaly what i do|`|TTLIp8Beaa	normally my horse only bucks when he feels really good (out for an early morning gallop or something along those lines) normally, i just pull up slightly on one rein and squeeze my legs to get him to move forward. that's all he really needs.

If the horse's head is going straight, it can buck, but if the horse's head is turned, it cannot buck.  And once the horse is calm, I give it's head back.  It may take a few minutes to a few months, depending on your horse.|`|yNHBBQ6faa	use my voice- kinda shout or talk real angry,<br>  ride the pony on,<br>  if this doesn't work i use my whip - 1 good smack(my pony bucks at the whip) or 3 short and sweet ones if it was a big buck,<br>  get the pony to trot if it was a big buck = they find it allot harder to buck in a trot with lots of impulsion,<br>  <br>  normally a good shout and a tap with a whip will straighten my pony out, but unlike some horses she's very responsive to my voice!<br>  <br>  hehehe= oops she ''bucked'' and threw me 3 minutes after the video stopped!!!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5jXEtdRkAU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5jXEtdRk...</a>|`|3YHZUuhyaa	When my horse bucks, I pull his head to one side and smack him with the reins and tell him "NO!" or "STOP THAT!".

I completely stop him and back up or do what I mentioned above.

She puts her head between her legs and goes to town. So it takes me at least 5 or 6 jumps to get in time with her. Once I am in time I pull one rein and and yell her out of it. Luckily for me she is a good minded mare and doesn't buck very often and when she does it is usually my fault.|`|sUN7TVtzaa	he doesn't buck-just crowhop sometimes. but my trainer told me if a horse bucks or rears i am supposed to turn it's head around to my knee so he can't continue the behavior. also just for saftey if he rears really high you might want to just slide off his butt in case he tips over or something. but it depends on what you want to do

If they haven't, that would at least solve part of the mystery.<br>  <br>  If they haven't, and the problem persists, it could possibly be an electronic malfunction.  Look around online to see if you can find similar complaints online.  Just type the name of the product into your search engine and see if anything comes up.  Electronics wear out over time, and this could be the case, especially if you have had power surges (or power outages) and the system is hooked into a regular outlet.  I have found that the best way to protect precious electronical equipment that I don't want to fail quickly is to use a surge protection system with a battery backup that prevents power surges from surging into your equipment.  When the power cuts out, a battery keeps it running, and it slowly shuts itself down, which cuts back on damaging surges.<br>  <br>  If there are no similar complaints online, or you can't find anything in the troubleshooter of your instruction manual, you should call the manufacturer and ask about this.  If it's under warranty, they will usually replace it or fix it for free.<br>  <br>  The only way you can find out if your cats are doing it would be to lock it (both ways) during the day when you have time to watch them.  <br>  <br>  The problem with the rock idea is that cats can fit themselves into very narrow spaces, so if there was even the slightest gap, they could have wiggled through without having to move the rock.  Or, they might actually have a different escape route that you don't know of.  Cats are very resourceful and if they really want out, they will almost always find a way.  My daughter's kitten figured out how to pop the vent hose (lint hose) from my dryer and shimmy his way out and under the trailer!  If you have an attic or a basement, they may have found an exit that you don't know of.  I also had a cat that could move freely around the house by jumping at an angle on a doorknob...somehow getting the momentum to turn the knob and push the door open at the same time!  Cats can be pretty amazing little creatures at times.<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't be of more help.  It's possible your kitties figured out how to get around the lock, but if they did, I'm sure that you would know because I would think that the settings would have been changed somehow.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Ok, take it as read that your cats are probably cleverer than you are. I reached this conclusion myelf several years ago when one of mine brought a cock pheasant in through the catflap. The bird was actually bigger around than the opening in the flap.  At the time of writing I have a three legged Abbysynnian who reguarly catches rabbits as large as himself and bring them still alive hrough two catflaps into my dining room. Accept that and you need ask no further questions!|`|6xiwiiIzaa	The cats are very Clever i have seen them knock at the Door Knocker to get in ,,
jDPULfjKaa	All this information is very good! i actually agree with all of it, and the info. and care tips is good. red eared slider? - BIG turtle, but they are also loving and playful and a fun species to have. Red eared sliders are basically as common as cats or dogs. But they require a lot more hard work (labor basically) to keep than cats or dogs. I'm not going to lie, they are at least 5 times more demanding then cats or dogs. And their setup is about 10 times more expensive than cats or dogs as well. It runs into the neighborhood of about $500 the first year for an adult turtle, and then about $100 every additional year for stuff like filter equipment, food, light bulbs, and calcium supplements)  trust me you want to start with an adult, even though it is much more expensive, an adult is very hardy. And a baby is very fragile and would probably be killed by your children accidentally. So an adult, by far better)  <br>  <br>  I would like to say though although turtles do make great family pets, turtles are very demanding, and you need to make SURE that you are willing to make the commitment. Not to sound like your mother or anything, but you need to have a stable job, because if you lose a job, the turtle would have to be given away, and it breaks my heart seeing family pets given away because the owners could not afford their supplies. I am being brutally honest, turtle supplies are dang expensive. So you need to make sure you have the money, because they do require a LOT of money.<br>  <br>  Oh yes. I was talking about aquatic turtles for most of the time, but keep in mind Tortoises are also expensive ( because they do require large pens) But actually some species, like the russian tortoise and box turtle are easier to keep, and may be right if you have children!! > sorry, a lightbulb just popped out of my head, lol. But, even though i do agree some species of tortoises are a lot less expensive to keep, they still require commitment due to the fact that they can very easily outlive their owners. So tortoises are definetly close family pets, and will probably more than likely live through 3 or more generations of families. So if you decided to get a tortoise in the near future, it would probably still be around to see your childrens' children. So again, the commitment has got to be there.<br>  <br>  Turtles and Tortoises overall make wonderful pets to owners that can provide them with loving care and financial care as well. By the way. Aquatic turtles absolutly hate being handled, so it would probably NOT be ok to have your children pet an aquatic turtle. it would be much safer to pet a tortoise. And a tortoise wouldn't mind, but a turtle would probably dislike it and get annoyed. So if you plan on having the children pet the animal, please cancel out aquatic turtles, because that would very easily stress them out.<br>  <br>  Just an example, of how each setup is different. No setup is really 'cheaper' or 'better'. They are both different in their own ways, and just depends on personal preference and willingness i guess......<br>  <br>  Aquatic setups<br>  <a href="http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t65/TurtlePhoto_Album/TurtlePics003.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i157.photobucket.com/albums/t65/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2334/2156078980_fe06f149ee.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2334/2156...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/157/338514701_c245123eb3.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/157/33851...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fishpondinfo.com/photos/reptiles/tanks/mike1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishpondinfo.com/photos/repti...</a><br>  <br>  Land setups<br>  <a href="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g206/Henry_flash/table5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g206/H...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.russiantortoisepictures.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=2982&g2_serialNumber=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoisepictures.com/g...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/56/116345810_85d76ab1a6.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/56/116345...</a><br>  <br>  some very good websites to explore<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/</a><br>  <br>  PLEASE RESEARCH if you would like to care for any type of animal, including turtles and tortoises.

Whenever working with aquatic turtles you will need to make sure that the aquarium space is kept extremely clean and that hands are always washed after handling the turtles.  I have a soft spot for russian tortoises which are a small species of tortoise with fairly easy requirements.  I added links below of their caresheets.  One thing is important to think about though...red eared sliders can live for 20 to 40 years if properly cared for and russian tortoises can outlive their owners so please be sure that these animals will be well cared for into the future if their novelty to your children eventually wears out.  *Never release pets into the wild*<br>  <br>  Russian tortoise: <><a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/care_sheet.htm>" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/care_shee...</a><br>  <br>  Red-eared slider: <><a href="http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/turtles/red-ear-slider.php>" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/turtl...</a>|`|Q4pUDkyHaa	I prefer painted turtles to sliders, esp western painter turtles. It depends what part of the country you're from. <br>  To do it right, it's not gonna be cheap.<br>  I recommend skipping an aquarium, and go straight for a rubbermaid stock tank. <br>  I'd also recommend it on a cement floor, because it's going to get heavy.<br>  You're going to need an aquarium heater that will keep the water at 80-82 degrees. A guard to protect that heater from damage. <br>  You'll also need at least 1 canister filter, a magnum 350 would be good.<br>  Also a spare filter, soak the old filter in bleach water and swap the filters weekly. Those 2 filters will last for years.<br>  They need a basking spot. I piled flat rocks in the middle, but if you don't have access to free flat rocks you may want to consider other options.<br>  After having aquatic turtles for 20 years or so, I can highly recommend the active UV + heat.  <a href="http://www.reptilesupply.com/product.php?products_id=435" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilesupply.com/product.php...</a> <br>  There are similar products out there that may be a few dollars cheaper, but they don't last, and you wind up buying them again and again.<br>  You'll also need a clamp lamp or fixture with a ceramic base. Don't skimp on this, trust me. The plastic base clamp lamps are garbage. The lamp I recommend is a mercury vapor lamp. They can't be dimmed. So you'll need some way to make sure the basking site is 88F-90F. And some way to adjust the distance between the lamp and the basking site.<br>  I hung the clamp lamp from a chain from the ceiling. Of course, you'd want to use a very secure method of attaching the lamp to the chain, as you really don't want the fixture falling into the water. I used zip ties to keep the cord out of the way.<br>  <br>  Sounds expensive? It is. <br>  But it's the best way. Skimping will only wind up costing more in the long run. Trust me. Vet care is expensive, and just buying pet turtle after turtle that dies in a year (Because of poor equipment, or poor care.) is irresponsible.<br>  I'd also recommend a python no spill clean and fill kit.<br>  It's a kit that attaches to your faucet and makes weekly cleanings a LOT easier.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Python-No-Spill-Clean-Fill/dp/B000255NXC" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Python-No-Spill-Cl...</a><br>  Trust me, it's worth every penny.<br>  <br>  Soft shell turtles are also a very rewarding pet to keep, but are more for advanced keepers.<br>  They wind up costing a lot more than painted turtles in the long run, as they need bigger tanks, better water quality, and they eat a lot more.|`|rccCVw0Zaa	I'm recommending RES (Red Eared Slider) more than 5 inchies. It's a semi-aquatic type. It's a very common type of turtles for pet and worldwide. It's easily adaptable and doesn't get sick easily.<br>  How old your boys are? Less 5 inchies RES carry a bactery which will harm children under 5 years old.<br>  It needs sunbath, put rocks inside the pool so that It can climb up and bath the sunlight. It's an omnivorous, so it can eat vegetables and meats (like fish, cricket, worm, etc). It also eat pellets.<br>  U need to change the water everydays.<br>  U can put UVB and UVA lights to keep the aquarium's temperature on days and close it on night. For me, I just put them on the yard so they can bask sunlight.<br>  <br>  I'm suggesting to read some articles about how to take care RES.<br>  like : <a href="http://www.redearslider.com./" rel="nofollow">http://www.redearslider.com./</a> is one of them.<br>  <br>  Peace Out.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	I assume you are wanting an easy starter turtle for an indoors setup? My favorite for that situation is a diamondback terrapin. If you buy yours captive-born, freshwater raised (and I can recommend an excellent online breeder with whom I have done business in the past) they are very hardy and easy to keep--in my opinion even more so than the commonly recommended red-eared slider. They've also got the friendliest personalities I've seen and are kind of unique-looking. They don't get any bigger than the red-eared sliders as adults either--9 to 12 inches long as adults. Another kind I like is the pearl river map turtle and their care is baically he same.<br>     For this kind of turtle, you could start with a 10 or 20 gallon tank for a baby and eventually grow to a 120 gallon one. The water temperature should be 70 to 77 degrees, and that's room temp for most people so you probably don't need a heater unless you keep your house cold. <br>     They'll need a completely dry basking area where they can sit under a light and dry off, including the bottom shell. This area must be at least 10 degrees warmer, ideally 90 degrees, so you'll need to shine a heat lamp on it. ZooMed's urtle-tuff halogen bulb screwed into a 8.5 or 10 inch dome reflector with a ceramic socket is great for this. It's splash-proof so you don't hav to worry about the bulb shattering into your tank and it puts out good heat. They should also have a UVB bulb as they use the UVB rays to make vitamin D which they need to be able to absorb calcium and keep their shells hard and strong. A 12 inch (or for your eventual 120 gallon tank, 24 inch) ReptiSun 10.0 bulb in a reflector will work nicely. Plug these two lights into a timer and set it so they'll be on 14 to 16 hours a day. That's how long the sun is up in the peak of summer, so that'll set a good day/night cycle for them.<br>     The water needs to be filtered well. The rule of thumb is 5 gallons of water per inch of turtle if its under 4 inches long and 10 gallons per inch after that, and the filter needs to be rated for twice or three times that much. So for a 3 inch diamondback terrapin, you'd need a 15 gallon tank and a filter rated for 30 or 45 gallons. For a 5 inch turtle, you'd need a 50 gallon tank and a filter rated for 100 to 150 gallons. Also the water needs to be changed once a week and the turtles should be fed in a separate bowl to avoid messes in their tank.<br>     My favorite substrate is crushed coral. It looks nice and is perfectly safe for turtles to chew on. It'll even provide them with a constant calcium source if they want it. Wild diamondback terrapins will actually chew on coral in their habitat for that reason. If you prefer, you can use gravel but make sure it's river rocks, not aquarium gravel. Aquarium gravel are usually actually large rocks that have been shattered at the plant, so they have sharp edges that can do damage if your turtle eats one. River rocks, by contrast, have been taken from river beds where they have been worn down by running water for decades and have smooth edges so they usually just pass on through when eaten. Also, if you choose this substrate, you'll need to provide a cuttlebone for the turtles to chew on. If one is not provided and turtles feel the need to eat calcium or wear their beaks down they oftentimes turn to chewing/eating gravel and cage accessories excessively.<br>     Diamondback terrapins are mostly carnivorous, so I feed mine live feeder minnows, earthworms, bloodworms, and gutloaded crickets. I supplement that with ReptoMin sticks, cichlid food, and ZooMed's naural aquatic turtle food and some greens like watercress, turnip greens, kale, endive, and occasionally romaine. These guys are BIG eaters! Feed the babies 3.5 inches long and under once a day 6 days a week. (They don't get to eat everyday in the wild and actually need some "fasting" days to clear out their gut completely and help prevent parasites, so I always recommend NOT feeding one day a week.) Turtles larger than 3.5 inches should only be fed 3 times a week.<br>     The really nice thing about keeping turtles is that you don't need a petsitter when you go on vacation. If they're being fed well/regularly, a couple weeks without food is not going to do them any harm at all. Just stock up their tank with fish right before you go, do a water change right before you go, and leave their lights on a timer and they're fine for up to 2 weeks. Then feed them and do a water change as soon as possible when you get back. The downside to turtles as pets is they're expensive because you have to grow with them and they require expensive lightbulbs. You can't put a baby 3-inch turtle into a 120 gallon tank and you can't put a 90 gallon filter on a 10 gallon tank as it will make a current that's too strong for a baby turtle to swim against. Also the fact that a properly-cared for turtle will likely live 40 to 100 years is a blessing for the pet lover but a curse for some because they mean a lifetime com
TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, my daughter has a very small 2yr old girl chihuahua, and like you she loves her dog.where she is the dog is there to.it even sleep in her bedroom.she is never without her dog.except school days.then it stays in her bedroom when it wants to.she takes it out all the time.i think as you do every think for your dog,and its not a big dog,then i think your mum/dad are being very unfair,and i would stand my ground with them.also you have had your dog a few years,so its unfair for it to be moved to another home.the shock of it can kill your dog. chihuahua are prone to have weak hearts.so really its unsafe to get rid of it.i really do know how you feel about your dog,as i have 2 very small 3yr old bishon frish dog,and like you they mean every think to me.so i am with you all the way on your problem.keep out of your parents way as much as possible.do you jobs around the house,that way mum can't start on you,then bring the dog up again,about the dog having to go to a new home.at the end of the day,your mum/dad will have the last word.good luck,and i hope you can keep your lovely dog.are you in the UK.i am in surrey uk.|`|MLC97M1Baa	Wow. Tough go and tough love. I am sorry, that seriously sucks majorly.<br>  The dog knows your mom does not like her, and is reacting on what she feels from your mom. They need more bonding time and the help of a behaviourist so no one is put in danger. Good luck.<br>  It may hurt to rehome the dog, but dogs should not live their lives in rooms. Its cruelty and very unfair. You are robbing him of the joys of life.|`|JAgOprrRaa	i wouldnt care i would tell my mum that she should have thought about this when she handed me over the dog. i have a dog myself and have had her for 5 years now and i am 17. why dont you let the dog stay in your room? thats where mine stays and if your mum says it is tight on the over dogs then tell her that this is your dog and the other 2 are her responsibility. i cant understand though why you are even asking about this i would never even think about it if my mum told me to give my dog up.. if you want to keep it it looks like our going to have to stand up for yourself and tell her this is not your fault if 3 is a problem <br>  YOUR MUM should have thought of this.. my dog has slept downstairs twice ever since she has slept in my bedroom. and tell your mum to stop being childish over not liking your dog as dogs react on the way humans act they can tell what mood they are in and your mum is probably causing the other 2 dogs to gang up on your one. good luck i no it sounds harsh but this problem is no one elses problem just your mums and she is also causing it and making it worse!!!|`|a603ba6ddc23b804b5da9ebcdd35be35aa	I am so sorry!  But...it would be best to listen to your mom. Parents always no what is best.  It's very sad that you have to keep them in a room.  Dogs love being outside, and I'm sure it will be happier in another home.  I'm sure it loves you very much, but if you want what is best for your dog you should just give it away.|`|dWK0B5g3aa	Oh dear, I would be devastated If I had to get rid of one of my dogs.<br>  Anyhow firstly you need to establish a pecking order between the mum and the daughter, when the mum 'attacks' tap her on the nose and say no. Try walking the two dogs together, feed the mum first and pet her first, hopefully that way the mum will be the more dominate one, although you might want help with a trainer if this doesn't work.<br>  I'd suggest allowing the dogs to come out of the room and maybe you letting the two dogs sit with you together as there may be some jealousy so give them equal attention. Maybe you should try spending more time with your mums dog and your mum spend more time with your dog. That way your mum will see that she is a great little dog and could also stop the jealousy a bit.<br>  Play games with the two dogs, like mini agility and fetch so that they are more calmer and happier together.<br>  Also the dog was a gift so your mum can't take it away!|`|kN4EaiUDaa	Tell your parents how much you love her and give them a really sad story so they feel bad. also try and take more responsibility for your dog. spend as much time with her you can, feed her, and let her be no burrden on your family. also try and train your dog so she's not so aggressive towards the other dogs.|`|k9q5eDnfaa	Hi Im sorry but it really is up to your mom and by the sound of it the dogs aren't too happy together either so for their sake she should go You could see if someone you know could have her then you would see her again You could even offer to walk her for them occasionally Just think if you keep her and they have a really bad fight and she got hurt bad you would feel awful so be kind and let her go. If no one you know wants her and she goes to a home you could ask them to ask her new owners to send you a pic every so often and keep in touch with them by email You never know they might let you visit too <br>  Give it a try
wLgGD63raa	A fertile egg feels like a stale marshmellow while an infertile egg looks and feels like a half-filled hotwater bottle.<br>  <br>  Eggs are easy to hatch. In fact, you get to have a powerful job, if you wish, since gecko eggs are temperature sex dependent. This means that the sex of the gecko is not determined at fertilization, but is set during the first two weeks in captivity by the high daytime temperature you expose the eggs to. A daytime high that does not exceed 82 F will give you all female offspring, but if you want to make that egg a "male" then you simply place the egg where it will experience 90-92 F as a daytime high during the first two weeks of incubation. (the following line was revised 07-22-03) If you keep "male" eggs at a constant 89-91 F you may have some embryos die from heat stress or if they are exposed to temps over 92 F they may become what we call "hot" or high temperature females, which never reproduce and often bully their cage mates. <br>  <br>  Now that you have learned a bit of science you can place your new eggs in a plastic container of moist potting soil, Vermiculite or Perlite. Bury the eggs only 1/2" and place two or three push-pin size airholes in a tight fitting lid. You can get fancy and buy a commercial incubator if you are after a particular sex or you can just place the container of eggs on a high shelf in your reptile room or home where the temperature varies from 74-94 F. (Don't worry if you only have a single female as a pet. She may lay eggs and of course they will be infertile.) Young will emerge on their own in 60-70 days using this method of incubation.<br>  <br>  Care of the young is the same as for the adults. They begin taking 1/4" crickets or one-inch mealworms at day 3 of their lives. Plastic shoeboxes are ideal homes for babies. At our reptile ranch we use #2 styrofoam meat trays (available in your grocery store) upside-down for a hide box, a pickle jar lid serves as a place for vitamin-mineral powder and the mealworms and a peanut butter jar lid works perfectly for a water bowl. The young need to be fed live insects daily or they may bite off the tails of their cagemates. Always sort the young to size every two weeks as there will be one or two babies that outgrow everyone else and once this competition begins it is only a matter of time before a small gecko will be eaten by its big brother or sister. If you wish to feed baby mice to an adolescent gecko you can achieve larger size and for a female you will get more eggs laid per season.|`|pf5G6ssJaa	good|`|i5AsfCuJaa	it's probably infertile if you have 2 females|`|jRte3cP8aa	eat it

They do not droop as much as a hay net and that makes it almost impossible for a horse to get a foot caught on the bag like he could a net. Also, since there is only one food opening, that also makes it harder for the horse to get a foot caught and makes him eat more slowly. <br>  <br>  I don't think hay nets in and of themselves are dangerous, but they must must must be tied correctly. Even in the ad you posted, the hay net is not tied right. It is only tied from the top. As a horse eats, the net starts to sag and he can get a foot caught in it. What you need to do with a net is dangle it from a high hanging place and run the rope through the ring at the bottom, then tie it up. That way, even when the net starts to sag, it is supported in two places and far less likely to dangle.|`|TNTFomKeaa	My horse had the same problem. I put some of her hay on the ground and some in a haylege net - the holes are smaller so it takes longer to eat it. I think as long as you tie the haynet up properly and it is high enough that your horse can't get his legs caught then it's perfectly safe. Leaving some hay on the ground lets her stretch her neck out, and of course she's out grazing during the day.<br>  Other things I do - cut the hard feed right down in order to increase the hay. It keeps them warmer in winter anyway. I also got toys like food balls which you put pony nuts into. Then your horse has to roll it around to get the food out - keeps them busy for ages. I also get veg like turnips, put a hole through the middle and hang it in the stable. Then she has fun trying to eat it. She's got pretty good at that game now. Sometimes I hide carrots in the bed too.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Maybe you should try a hay bag.  They are much safer than  hay nets.  To slow him down you could fluff up his three flakes so that when he takes a bite he only gets a few pieces at a time.  This probably won't make much of a difference though - if you slow him down from 1/2 hour to 1 hour, he's still got a long, boring night ahead of him.  As long as he's not developing any stable vices from  boredom, I think I'd just let him be bored.|`|979090faf6f85c0f0923e03261b8a308aa	i totally forget what its called but its like a think you put ur horses nose into (its rubber with quarter sized holes in it) it makes it so they can only eat like a quarter size of hay in each bite... anyways you hook it to his halter and then he has to eat slower.. so sorry i forget what its called|`|XJ9oSR2daa	It looks like it has smaller openings, am I correct?<br>  <br>  I think that would be way safer, but if your horse has front shoes on, they always can get their shoe hooked on that if pawing or being snotty etc.<br>  <br>  My monster donkey put his hoof in the hole in his hay bag at denver stock show, so no matter how safe you try to make it, it seems they can always do one up on you.  <br>  <br>  He was totally fine btw.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	I have a horse that's the same way and I feel bad because he doesn't get enough "chew time."  So I give him a couple flakes of straw with his dinner.  That way he has something to chew on but doesn't get the extra calories but then you don't have to worry about hay nets or toys or any of that stuff either.  It works like a charm...keeps him happy as a clam!  Might be worth a shot in your situation as well.|`|zBioLZ9Saa	you could try a hay bag like this. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com/kensington-hay-bag/p/X1-27287/cn/1807/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com/kensington-...</a><br>  <br>  these hay bags come in cute colors and different styles too<br>  and hang it higher up in his stall or where ever you put it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3 flakes? that seems a little much for your horse unless hes like super big.|`|FrqKyNdAaa	Another choice if you're afraid of your horse getting bored, try getting him a salt lick or some such toy. I use an apple lick and that keeps my mare busy.<br>  just an idea, good luck!|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	I use hayage nets mainly - the holes are too small for them to get their feet tangled, plus make sure that they are tied so that when they are empty they don't hang down enough to get tangles. The other option is to put up a hay rack - this will slow them down and no risk of getting tangled. <br>  <br>  I will say I've used nets for years as my cob gets fat and has to have restricted access to make sure she always has access and I've never had any problems. The other thing you could try is mix a little good qualtiy straw in with the hay. If it's good quality it won't do the horse any harm and will give him something to eat without any nutrional benefit so no getting fat. You could also get a treatball - a ball with a small hole. put fibre nuggets or something like that in and they spend hours trying to get the treats out - it gives them something to do with heads down and keeps their brain active.

The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|298865cd9302e6c3b9f7e1e85844a845aa	I think she's a tabby mix.<br>  <br>  You can tell she's at least part tabby because she has an "M" on her forehead. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby_cat</a>|`|4pQdvWtZaa	the 2nd pic!

K4rP4A0naa	Just think of live rock as a good biological filter. It works well because it is porous, hence has loads of surface area to grow beneficial bacteria. You will have the same effect with a canister or trickle filter because of the filter media they contain. The thing is these collect a lot of waste so they need regular cleaning. <br>  <br>  Sure you won't get the benefit of microfauna and flora but you can still have the tank if you just keep a couple of fish. It's a good idea to get ammonia and nitrate test kits when you start up to make sure your water is clean and you'll need to research cycling the tank before adding fish.

Lots of people do this because they are against buying something that was harvested from coral reefs. It will become "Live" when you use good live sand and from the saltwater. <br>  <br>  It's better for your tank and livestock if you have live rock - that is your filtration.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Ouch.<br>  Yes it can be done, I've done it.

nMe35c9Aaa	i think maybe someone else put out something like rat Poison or something. i have a squirrel and he is pretty good about not eating stuff that he shouldn't. he puts it all in his mouth but spits the bad stuff out . but with rat Poison it is flavored so that rats will eat it. if it where just on dead squirrel you may be able to right it off as something else but with so many it seems like a pretty good chance it was something put there fro that reason. a lot of people get very annoyed with squirrels cause they get in there attics and what not. most people would trap then but that is expensive so the horrible cheap people poising them. or perhaps they actually trying to kill rats in there house and did not consider that other animals may eat it as well. either way very sad and careless.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	call the local animal control and have them remove the rodents for testing.|`|Fu7OK54kaa	maybe someones putting down poison. If not for them - something else and they've eaten it anyway
8474581acbbf3af73ba609e00ff353ecaa	Before you think about getting an exotic, you should first check with local vets to see if your new pet can be treated there in case of illness or emergency. <br>  Pot bellied pigs can be excellent pets if you do a lot of research, and have a lot of patience. You might also consider something along the lines of a Muntjac deer. They're mini deer that can be house trained. <br>  Skunks are great 70% of the time.

se27sAUwaa	I had adopted two kittens from a local shelter. The little girl was sick with an upper respiratory, same symptoms as yours. They gave me Doxycycline (antibiotic) to administer for 10 days, .5 cc's daily. Since the little boy wasn't sick I've had to isolate her. They will prob. just give you antibiotics for both kitties and send you on your way. Apparently cats get stuck with this "cold" for a long while and usually need meds to overcome it. I would bring them both in. Unless you can just call the Vet and describe the symptoms, maybe they'll give you the meds without an office visit?? (Doubtful though). Good luck!!|`|zeTGmB3faa	It sounds like an upper respiratory infection that has gotten progressively worse. Your cat may now have pneumonia. Both cats need testing and treatment by the vet right away as the infection has been brewing for quite some time. You really should for<br>  go the vacation until both cats are in excellent health. These things happen where it is necessary to change ones plans. Best wishes and health to your cats.
hetZz4c1aa	It's not a change in diet she needs.  Your little girl needs to see the vet.  A great deal can be done to make her more comfortable with proper dental care.  It's a bit expensive, but in the end is well worth it!  Can you imagine going your entire life without any dental care.....very PAINFUL.  So pick up the phone and make an appointment.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|cii9XShcaa	Dental care will def help in this situation from a Vet if several of her teeth have fallen out. Once you take her to the vet and have them check her out, then you should worry about changing her diet to a high quality canned food with no fillers such as corn, no by-products, and no words with 'meal' behind them. And make sure that a meat is the first ingredient. If the name of the food is Turkey Feast, the first ingredient should be Turkey; not corn, turkey meal, meat meal, or turkey by-products. Second desired ingredient should be water or more meat. I feed my cats AvoDerm Select Cuts. Another diet change can be feeding raw. My cats eat half canned (AvoDerm) and half raw (Taylor Pond Farms through mypetcarnivore.com). Raw is the best diet for them as it is a mimic of what they would eat in the wild. I choose to do half and half since it's more convenient for my schedule. My cat's use to eat dry and their breath smelled disgusting. I always wondered why they didn't stink since they use their tongues to groom themselves. Once I switched to canned, the stink was hardly there. They had to be really close to my nose, about 4 in or less, for me to smell their breath. Once half and half, there's really no smell to speak of. Make sure you do plenty of research on whatever you decide to do, whether canned or raw. If you choose to feed dry, make sure it's high quality with the first ingredient being meat again. But really, if you choose to stick with a high quality dry, that's basically feeding the highest quality of the lowest quality choice. <br>  <br>  Also, if you switch to canned or raw, this will also cut down the smell of the litterbox since their poop won't be nearly as smelly.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	There's something much more important here than changing her bad breath. And that is her health. Your kitty likely has some serious dental issues and this needs to be addressed with your vet. It sounds like she needs to have her teeth cleaned professionally, and it can make her very sick if you continue to let her teeth rot and fall out.<br>  <br>  Once you've gotten her teeth taken care of, I'd switch her to a high quality cat food.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a> (Raw Fed Cats)<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs/profile/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs...</a> (Raw Dogs Livejournal Community [not just for dogs despite the name!], excellent raw feeding information on the profile page and overall helpful community for raw feeding questions)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html</a> (Myths About Raw Feeding)<br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet.

Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to feline obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times loosely based on the feeding guidelines on your cat's food.

B6zl0AJDaa	I read your additional post and decided I'd add my two cents.  Some are so busy reading books that they just don't get real applications.<br>  <br>  I posted a rotation wormer question last year and got some GREAT answers but YA doesn't let you post links to answered questions.  If you'd like me to, I can copy and paste it in an email and send it to you.  It was really informative.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	As for name brands, just look at the ingredients.  Any wormer with ivermectin it is is the same... it's not worth paying extra for a name brand!  I rotate wormers so as to kill parasites which are resistant to one wormer.  It is a lot more effective to rotate them than it is to just use one.<br>  <br>  A very effective method of controlling worms is to rotate pastures and let some pastures lie fallow for a while.  This interrupts the worm's life cycle.  Another way is to rotate between cows and horses in the pasture, if possible.  The cow's digestive track kills horse worms and the horse's digestive track will kill worms that parastize cows.|`|px27V5N9aa	I normally use brand name but I have used generic.<br>  I also rotate my wormers....but HAVE used two of the same kind in a row.<br>  Normally if I forgot to mark which one I used or if I'm doing something different in my program and need to do a double then I will.<br>  <br>  Here are a few websites that I use to help me determine my plan of action.<br>  <a href="http://www.newrider.com/Library/Horse_Care/worming_diary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newrider.com/Library/Horse_Ca...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spequine.com/horse_health.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spequine.com/horse_health.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.farnamhorse.com/dewormdetails/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.farnamhorse.com/dewormdetails...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.largeanimalprotectionsociety.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.largeanimalprotectionsociety....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.americanminiaturehorse.com/worming.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanminiaturehorse.com/wo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.horsehealthusa.com/wormerrotation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsehealthusa.com/wormerrota...</a>|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Stephanie L has a great answer.  I too used generic brands most of the time for my own horses and saved a bit of money that way. It was cheaper than buying the rotation packs.  It's a simple matter to just keep track of what you wormed for and when on a calendar.  Every Valley Vet catalog has a little chart of when to rotate wormers and for what - I would just cut it out and tape it to my calendar in the barn for easy reference.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	I worm every 6-8 wks when my farrier comes to keep them on track.<br>  <br>  I use Equimax Horse wormer.

I also get them tube wormed by the vet twice a year.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	I get mine from Country Supply.  They have two twelve month programs.  One is $25 annually, the other is $40 ('premium').   My personal friend vet says one's as good as the other.|`|xsNaCNBaaa	My personal choice is to go with Continuex daily wormer and then twice a year supplement that with Ivermectin to get the bots.  I like daily wormers simply because my horse HATES to be wormed, and this way he only has to deal w/ paste 2 times a year.  Most barns worm either every 2 months or every 3 months and rotate wormers each time to make sure they cover all worms.

The only thing that matters is that you DO NOT use the same dewormer twice in a row.  It is good to get on a type of rotation with dewormers.  Certain ones are supposed to be used in the summer because they protect against bots, and bots are not a problem in the winter, so therefore those dewormers do not need to be used in the winter.<br>  <br>  I personally rotate my own horses.  I just go in the store and pick out a dewormer that I haven't used for past two or three times.  Like others have said, this stops them from building up a resistance.<br>  <br>  I am glad people ask questions on here.  It helps me learn too, even if I don't have questions. :)
zeTGmB3faa	If you were honestly not hurting your cat, you need to explain what happened to everyone who asked. The girl who started this rumor, needs to be confronted and asked why she was say such things about you if they are untrue. Perhaps she can help put these rumors to rest.|`|y3jD0DDpaa	as im in secondry school i know bullying not that anyone bullys me.

Once they stop getting the reaction they want they will eventually tire of teasing you and move on to the next victim. Laugh it off... laugh them off. Or at least try not to show them that you care about what they're saying. Like, "Wow, you're absolutely right! I LOOOOVE to beat my cats. Doesn't everybody??"  LOL or "You know, I'm flattered that you take so much time out your day to think about me. Really, thanks." Just laugh at them.  They're being immature, it's not always right to fight fire with fire but it sure is fun.
tC2kzZmPaa	Well, it does depend on your situation. If your lifestyle isn't suitable for keeping a pet which needs so much attention then there's not much to do about it.<br>  <br>  However, if you think there's a possibiliy of keeping a dog in good condition then I reckon there are a few things you could do. This kind of thing worked for me! I begged for a dog for about 5 years til my parents gave in...<br>  <br>  You need to show that you're responsible. Like, not just tell her but actually do something so she notices. So generally, being good and doing chores I suppose. Or you could volunteer at a vet or animal shelter which would also show you're so enthusiastic that you're willing to devote time to keeping an animal.<br>  <br>  Do you have relatives or friends who have a dog? If they ever go away then it's a REALLY good opportunity to show your mum you are capable and willing to look after one if you 'dog-sit' someone else's dog when they're on holiday/away for a few days.<br>  <br>  Maybe do research about which dogs are lower-maintenace and show that you've carefully thought about it. That would probably impress your mum, if you haven't done that already.<br>  <br>  Also, are your dad /grandad on your side? If so then you could really emphasize to them how important it is to you and beg them to talk to your mum about it. When I wanted a dog my dad was really against it, and though my mum wasn't too keen to start with, I persuaded her first and then she persuaded my dad.<br>  <br>  Well, good luck! Don't get your heart set on it in case it doesn't happen though. Remember a dog will probably end up being partly your mum/parents responsibility too as dogs live for quite a few years. You're 14 now but what about if you go to university or move out at 18? The dog would still only be around 4 and have plently of life left. So, if you try and see things from your mum's perspective as well, I think it would help.|`|EYOQVTGbaa	I used to want a pet to (still do actually).

Will you still be living with your parents when you are 30?  If not then your mum is right to say no.  You would not be able to take a dog to Uni, and it is unlikely that your first home would be somewhere that you could take a dog to.  If you got a dog now your mum would end up being left with it, and if she does not want a dog that is not fair.  The best thing to do would be to wait until you are settled with your own place and are in a position to look after a dog.<br>  <br>  For now why not start volunteering at a rescue centre.  You would be able to spend time with dogs and it would help you be prepared for when you do get one.|`|HGLdQgpEaa	It took me a bunch of years to convince them, I will be getting a Sibe puppy soon.<br>  First of all to persuade them I had to show I was responsible, I would put my lil baby to sleep when they were away and take care of her. I also had to get my grades high enough so that they would approve. Talk to your parents about it, show that you are responsible enough to have one. You could also if you have a friend who owns a dog go practice and show how you are responsible by walking, bathing, grooming and caring for it. My friend has two dogs and we would walk them often which also convinced my parents.

Your local animal shelter is desperate for volunteers to walk their dogs in a private field.  Decide how much time you can really, really spare then act as a volunteer dog walker.  This way you can prove to your mum that you have what it takes to be a dedicated carer.  The animal shelter won't let you take the dogs home but you will see the dogs being rehomed with really lovely carers.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Best wishes from Sue|`|xxtrFHn6aa	If getting a smaller pet is not allowed either, then prove you are responsible a different way?

Sometimes it's hard for you to imagine what it is like of puppy parenting.  As a dog owner, I want to share with you so you can then make the right decision...as you said, you are not a child anymore.<br>  <br>  The first year of a puppy is as consuming as having a baby.  1. Toilet training, dogs don't born with the skill to go outdoor to pee/poo.  You need to train it.  Depends on the method and the breed, some could take 6 mths to grasp it.  And puppy cannot hold for too long, they need to go pee every couple hours.  My puppy is 8 mths old now, but he usually wants to let outside to do his thing after three to four hours.  So when you are in school, and let's say both your parents are working...who is going to let the dog out.  Yes, you can use indoor pee pad, but I don't recommend it...because you are teaching the dog pee/poo indoor is ok.  You can one day come home and find your dog pee on your bed!  Then it's the night time, young puppy can't hold for the whole night, for the first three weeks coming home, my puppy basically woke up at 11pm, 2am, 4am and 7am.  And because you don't want him to have an accidents inside the crate and sometimes it's hard to tell whether it wakes up for the sake of waking up or whether he needs to go washroom...so yes it's 2am but you still need to take the dog out.  Could you do this?<br>  <br>  Then puppy needs to be fed three times a day for the reason of avoiding hypoglycemia.  When you are in school, who is going to feed the dog at lunch time?  You can't just left kibbles around, because if you free feed, your dog will have irregular pee/poo schedule.<br>  <br>  Then the cost, puppy could get expensive and young puppies tend to get sick easily.  My puppy for the first 6 mths, I have spent closed to $1500 in vet bills.  If your puppy is the unlucky one likes the one I bumped into yesterday, it develops a shoulder problem at age one and the surgery cost is $4000.  I know not all dogs will get sick, but the whole family need to have a budget for it.  You are not working, you need to be sensitive whether your parents can afford it especially during this economic downturn.<br>  <br>  Training and socialization is also important.  An untrained and under socialized dog has high probability ending up in shelter.<br>  <br>  Are you planning to go to college and live in campus?  If so, who is going to take care the dog because most campuses don't allow dogs.  It is unfair to leave the dog duty to your parents.<br>  <br>  So this is not about how old you are....dog ownership is about whether you are in the right stage of your life.

It's your home.  You're the boss.    <br>  <br>  Also, some cats won't go in the same box as another cat regardless if they are related or not.

wnnudNp5aa	Those fish have fungus. If it hasn't shown up on your fish yet, you may be in the clear. If it does arise, treat with Maroxy. Use Maracyn, Maracyn-two, Maracyn-plus, or Maracyn-TC to prevent secondary infections from bacteria.<br>  I would get the female fish out of that tank and house her in a secondary tank until you can add more fish. 2 weeks is a good waiting time to see if infections are going to show up. This is why it is so critical to have a "hospital" or quarantine tank set up. This can just be a smaller, plain tank, no gravel, decorations or anything else. Just your basic equipment, heater, filter, etc. When you get new fish, keep them in the quarantine tank for two weeks before introducing them into your main tank. Then, if any infection shows up, you only have to treat the new fish, and don't run the risk of your whole tank getting sick.If you can't afford a secondary tank at the moment, you can buy a divider that allows the water to flow through, but which separates a section of the tank. You can keep the boys away from your girl that way, too. I've seen these in different sizes at Petsmart.<br>  Hope your fish turn out to be okay. Good luck!|`|K4rP4A0naa	If you're worried about the female, set up a quarantine tank and transfer her. You should always quarantine fish a minimum of 4 weeks so that if problems like that should arise you don't have to go fishing around a display tank.<br>  <br>  You should wait at least 4 weeks beofre buying more fish just in case it is Ich. It sounds more like some sort of fungal or bacterial problem though.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	Have you cycled your tank?! if you havn't return all your fish quickly and reaserch.

cj31x3UMaa	NO acetone!<br>  <br>  If the fur is long enough for you to have someone hold the cat & cut the stuff off, do that. Otherwise... take it to the vet & have them do it. <br>  <br>  Preferable to go to vet as they will do a more through job & can knock the cat out if necessary.<br>  <br>  This stuff needs to be removed BEFORE the cat starts chewing on it!
w9aR8ymGaa	The puppy really needs to be seen by a vet.  The vet can provide formula as well as wormer medication.  The puppy won't have solid poop until she is on solid food.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	ALL OTC wormers are utterly useless CRAP!!!!!<br>  Worms do NOT cause diarrhea!<br>  Wormers are passed through FECES so of course other dogs can be contaminated.<br>  All pups should be dosed w/STRONGID for rounds first &  w/panacur for the rest.<br>  <br>  A 5 wk.old pup should NOT have "formula"! It should have been started on mush over a week & 1/2 ago.<br>  <br>  It also needs VACCINATING before dies from some lovely=PREVENTABLE= fatal virus!|`|1Is7u1wUaa	You can buy special puppy milk from pet shops. The puppy should have been wormed at 3 weeks to start off with. I would buy the stuff from the vets as pet shop stuff isnt very reliable.  She also needs to be wormed at 5 weeks and 7 weeks but as she is 5 weeks already I would worm her now and then at 7 weeks and then 9 weeks and then every 3 months. Your puppy should be fully weaned at 6 weeks so while giving her the puppy milk you should be already introducing puppy food. You can give her dry food soaked in the milk. But gradually increase the amount of food you give her. She shouldn't need the milk after 6 weeks but if she isnt eating you can add a bit of milk (it can be ordinary cows milk if you want) to her food to encourage her to eat it or add a bit of water to soften it. <br>  <br>  Your other dogs wont catch worms if they have been wormed.<br>  <br>  Diarrhoea is never normal but I don't know what you are currently feeding her. If you keep changing what you are feeding her rapidly then this is going to cause diarrhoea.<br>  <br>  Your puppy also need to be deflead.|`|2as8xCsoaa	She's getting to the point where she can be started on some soft food.  What are you feeding her now???  That could be the cause of the diarrhea... What does the diarrhea look like?  Does it smell funny?  Any blood or mucusy looking stuff?  If so, she needs a vet asap.  <br>  As for the wormer, Walmart wormer sucks.  I would take her to a vet for a general checkup, get her wormed, has she had her distemper/parvo vaccination yet?  She will need a couple of those.  <br>  Make sure she is drinking water also... <br>  All in all, a pup that age, a vet check is needed regardless.. Might as well just get it over with and ensure a healthy start for your young pup.  :o)  The general puppy stuff isnt usually too expensive.
um5CVvTfaa	IF your dog is up to date on his rabies shot-- he doesn't need another until that one is up.  Depending on where you live, there are 1,2,3 year shots.|`|AA12128656	if your dog is up to date on his rabies shot,  (ask your vet) then he doesn't need one. if he is due for it, then you should get him to the vet for it!|`|MGOFjVnVaa	something is wrong here - your dog certainly will not die if he<br>  has his shots regularly, including rabies shots.<br>  supposing the dog has rabies,giving him the shot after he has<br>  bitten will not save the person he has bitten and as far as i<br>  know, when someone ofr some dog is infected with rabies<br>  shots after a biting incident will not help. the dog needs<br>  protective shots, so he cannot get rabies.|`|AA11244754	If he has had all of his shots then it was your responsibility to have shown the guy from the health department that he is current on all of his shots and he doesn't need another rabies vaccination.  I would suggest that you find your records or go to you vet and get a record of his last rabies vaccination and show it to him.  If he's had his rabies vaccination and he isn't due for another one yet then no he can't die of rabies and there are signs and symptoms of a dog having rabies.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Don't know where you are but in the US it is a law to have the rabies shot.  This is the only one that is required by law.  It differs from one state to another, here in NM we have get the shots every 3 years.  Some states say once a year.<br>  <br>  If the dog had been rabid you would have to go through a series of shot.  They used to be give in the stomach & were very painful.  I think it is delivered differently now.<br>  <br>  With in those 10 days the dog would have shown signs of rabies if he had have been rabid.<br>  <br>  I live just about 4 blocks from the Rio Grande River & along the river on both sides is a Bosque & wild animal that can transfer rabies live there.  Skunks, raccoons, oppossums, coyotes, river rats, etc so the risk is high but we haven't had a rabies case in a long time so they lengthen the shots to 3 years from once a year.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Something odd about what you have apparently been told.  He will only die from rabies if he actually gets rabies.  And there's no relation between him biting you, and now needing to have a shot (unless this man thinks you have rabies and have passed it on to your dog!!! lol) Perhaps you misunderstood.  His rabies shots need to be boostered regularly (when I was living in Canada, we had to have them done every year but it may have changed since we left).<br>  <br>  Actually if there was any chance your dog had rabies (and you were not able to produce his vaccination/booster card) he would surely have had to be quarantined after he bit you, so the authorities could keep an eye on him!!  Serious stuff because had he shown any signs of developing the disease, he would have had to be pts (the only way they can confirm rabies is by looking at the head/brain).<br>  <br>  Bottom line, your dog needs to be boostered, even if he's had his initial vaccination against rabies.  Check with your vet about how frequently.<br>  <br>  And a tet. shot/antibiotics is a normal treatment for you, provided the animal isn't obviously rabied!!|`|jIzlBCzxaa	yes your supposed to give a rabies shot to any dog. its required if you want the dog in any dog classes of some sort or if you want to take the dog somewhere with you. just to make sure your dog isnt contagious or has rabies. its a normal procedure and you should give the dog the rabies shot ASAP.|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Where do u live? Your dog only need a rabies shot if you are in a rabies infected area. i live in UK we don't get rabies here.|`|lrVSk62yaa	Yes you are soposed to|`|7IjGzvqTaa	Well, even if the dog hasn't contracted rabies, it's usually a good idea to get them the shot as a preventative method.  Most vets require a rabies shot after a bite because they check up on the dog's medical history (when their last shots were, what kind of shots, etc.), and often times, it's been a while since their last shot.  I would highly suggest getting your dog the shot, even if he doesn't have rabies.  It may prevent future infection, and if that comes along, you'll be glad you took him in.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	I know there is a lot of controversy about canine vaccines and over-vaccinating.<br>  <br>  Here is the problem -- your dog may NEVER come in contact with any of the diseases your dog gets vaccines for -- BUT IF IT SHOULD your dog has protection and that is the important part.  ALL of the diseases they vaccinate against are DIRE and the dog is GRAVELY ill and most can be fatal.<br>  <br>  The Rabies vaccine is one of these.  Rabies is a VERY nasty disease that very few dogs live through.  Rabies is not common, BUT it has not been eliminated in the United States as it has in Great Britain (this is why the quarantine period is 6 months long in England).<br>  <br>  Rabies is contracted by an infected animal - rat, bat, raccoon, opossum.  The only real way they can test to see if the dog HAS rabies is to examine brain tissue and that is why the dog ends up euthanized.  If you have proof of rabies vaccine, the dog who has bitten someone gets a Vet check 3 times in 10 days (just to make sure).  If they do not find the dog that caused the bite or can not prove the dog has been vaccinated, the bitten person MUST go through a SERIES of PAINFUL INOCULATIONS.<br>  <br>  Having said all this, keeping your dog up to date with his vaccines is the prudent and responsible thing to do for his sake and yours.

My parents even thought of putting him to sleep but i said "No, give him time, he will walk again." and sure enough when i came home from school i saw him standing up and walking again! i was so happy! His head had a dent in it though cause i guess some part of his brain collapsed.

He was fed a vet formulated home-cooked diet and was promptly taken to the vet at the first sign of any illness. <br>  <br>  We had to help him cross over to the other side because he was becoming too weak and could no longer feed himself, and the vets could not figure out what was wrong with him. <br>  <br>   He was also very stoic, like most dogs.  Thus we also feared he was in pain, but did not show it.  <br>  <br>  The average age for a large dog is 12 to 14 years.  Still, I have friends whose Large breeds lived to be 19 despite the average age prediction of 12 to 14. <br>  <br>  Your dog lived a long time.  You did good.  They just don't live as long as humans live.<br>  <br>  It's difficult to put a definitive age on a dog's life span. <br>  <br>  Just like humans on average die at 70 but some live to be 100 plus. <br>  <br>  I am sorry for your loss.

Dog grooming is a service so you should tip the groomer. Most groomers make a percentage of what the shop charges. So if you pay $50 for your dog to be groomed, the groomer may actually only see $20-$25 of that. So a tip is kind of nice for them to get.<br>  <br>  When I worked as a groomer I had a few clients that tipped, many tipped very well. But I would say the majority of the clients didn't tip at all. That was kind of hard since I would spend hours with their dog and only see a few bucks for it. That's one of the reasons why I got out of grooming, there were times when I could barely afford to pay my rent!|`|fgxajTiBaa	It is considered polite to tip at a groomer, whether that is a private groomer OR Petsmart/Petco. The groomers in corporations only make 50% of what you are charged so a tip is usually a nice addition.<br>  <br>  Groomers get peed on, pooped on, bitten, covered in hair/skin and all sorts of stuff so you can have your dog cleaned up.

hqnYJV38aa	I would highly recommend another cage mate for your piggie simply because of the whole "guinea pigs are social" thing, plus I'm sure she will get lonely without a buddy. Especially since she's been paired since birth. <br>  <br>  It's always a good idea to quarantine the new piggie first, make sure her health is good, and let the girls do their own thing for a while. It's always important to remember to introduce pigs in neutral territory, like the bathtub, or a floor. www.cavyspirit.com has a lot of good information on bonding pigs. You can also google it and get as much info as needed for your arsenal.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	It depends. Do you intend to keep guinea pigs for a long time in the future? It's easy to get into a never-ending cycle of replacing guinea pigs, since after one dies, there's always a lonely survivor. <br>  <br>  Your pig would appreciate a new companion. Introductions can be tricky sometimes, but with a little work, two pigs will be happier in the long run. However, if YOU don't think you can commit to keeping pigs well into the future, it might not be in anyone's best interest to get another.<br>  <br>  How old is the pig you have now? If she's fairly young, I'd definitely recommend getting her a new companion. If she's older, though, she might not accept a new pig as readily, and as I said, you might just be starting the "cycle" over again.<br>  <br>  I've got 3 pigs currently. I got two many years ago, and when one died, I got another one, a younger one. The older one eventually died, and I was left with one lone, younger pig. So what did I do? I adopted two more. Now, I've enjoyed my experienced with pigs, but when the three that I have now go, I don't really think I should replace them, since I travel a lot and it's not a good time in my life for me to have a lot of pets. Does that mean that I'll have one lone pig at some point? Probably, but it's better than getting another pig that I won't be able to spend a lot of time with.<br>  <br>  So, my long answer basically translates to, "If you want another pig, get one, if not, don't."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cavyspirit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavyspirit.com/</a> has some info on introductions, I believe.|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Well since she is a female she will be more likely to accept another cage mate.

K4rP4A0naa	I just feed my dog a mix of raw meats and she gets some vegies from a raw meat roll I buy. The roll also contains kelp and vitamins and minerals and some other nutritional additives. I'm in Australia so it's pointless telling you the brand.<br>  <br>  What I feed has been decided by what my dog will eat but you can try all of these things and see what your's likes. I don't usually mix or make recipes, but rather give different things each week.<br>  <br>  Chicken wings and necks are good for the dog's teeth, as are meaty bones. I only feed the latter occasionally as they don't have much flesh on them. <br>  <br>  For maintaining weight I feed ground meat, ox/beef heart, chicken hearts and the roll I mentioned, as well as other prepared raw meat foods with nutritional additives. If you want to spoil your dog you can give it chicken breast.<br>  <br>  Things like liver and tripe are good if you can get your dog to eat them. i'd only feed this once a week, as well as raw salmon which is good for omega 3. You could also mix some chopped carrots and broccoli into the meats and raw eggs with crushed shells are supposed to be good also. High in protein.<br>  <br>  A dog's digestive system passes the food quick so the main thing is to focus on foods like this that are highly nutritional so they can absorb as much as possible in that time.|`|ed511b455d00d21a007309cca49b2414aa	Basic Raw Dog Food Recipe <br>  for a 20-25# dog:<br>  <br>  1/2 cup raw meat (ground poultry, beef, lamb, organ meats) <br>  1/2 cup raw pureed vegetables (variety!) <br>  1/4 cup cooked whole grains <br>  1 teaspoon bonemeal powder (double for puppies and pregnancy) <br>  1/4 teaspoon ascorbic acid powder with bioflavinoids (vitamin C)<br>  1/4 teaspoon kelp powder <br>  <br>  Some folks eliminate the grains and increase the meat and vegetables proportionately. The meat must be RAW. Dogs should be fed raw bones (cooked bones will splinter). Vegetables must be pureed or they will come out looking pretty much the same way they did going in.<br>  <br>  Wild canines get their vegetable matter by eating the digested intestinal contents of their vegetarian prey.|`|VybYClAHaa	I have dogs that can sometime be picky, I wouldn't reccomend feeding them raw meat all the time. Maybe some lean ground beef with garlic rolled into meatballs for a treat once in a while.

Do not feed grapes they are toxic!|`|jQKE3Jusaa	I dont have any, but please email me if you find any healthy ones, I even asked my vet for some, he said cooked lean meat, chicken, potatoes, carrots and thats about it !

Google www.dogaware.com, click on dog feeding info, There's a lot of good info on line to guide you on correct nutritional needs, it's more than just meat and bones. My diet has evolved over the years and I no longer feed veggies but do give my dogs raw green tripe regularly. Good Luck.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	There is nothing wrong with supplementing a good quality dog food with raw beef or chicken and raw vegetables and rice, oatmeal, or pasta. <br>  <br>  If you are looking to go with a totally raw diet -- BE CAREFUL.  Bones can cause impacted bowels and some dogs have a problem with raw diets as they can get pancreatitis (there was just a blurb on this in Dog Fancy Magazine).
tWTJ4CSIaa	My baby was doing that when I first bought her too.  After every single jump she would bolt and i could pull as hard as I wanted and she would just pull harder.  So, here are my four suggestions:<br>  <br>  1. The one thing that my trainer had us do that I loved was turning her into the wall.  Since you mentioned jumping I assume you are riding in an arena.  If she is not listening, ask for a downward transition on the rail, if she doesn't come back IMMEDIATLEY, loosen your inside rein (no contact with her mouth) and pick up HARD on your outside rein to turn her into the wall, she will slow to a walk without you having to fight with her.  I know it sounds like you would crash her into the wall, but it doesn't work like that (the reiners at my barn do this all the time to train sliding stops).  Once she is walking the opposite direction, ask her back to the canter and then for the downward transition again.  If she does not listen, turn her hard back into the wall and start again.  The first day I was training like this I went up and down the rail probably 50 times until she would trot as soon as I asked her.  The wonderful thing about this system is that there is no fight, she has to slow down and listen.  Just give it a try, hopefully it will work for your mare like it worked for mine.<br>  <br>  2. A major mistake that I made was riding with a hard hand.  Because you want the horse to slow down, it is very easy to pull back hard and hold there.  It is key to move your hands when asking for downward transitions.  Wring your hands as if squeezing a sponge, wiggle them back and forth and above all, pull AND LET GO.  I know this also sounds crazy but it is the key to getting a horse soft in the bridle.  It seems counterintuitive, but if you set your hands in one place, the horse has something to hang on and pull against.  If you are constantly moving your hands, she cannot pull against them.  So just give it a try, sing your ABC song at the canter and only pull on each letter, A (pull) REST (put your hand foreward a bit) B(pull) REST C(pull) REST.  I'm sure you get the idea.  <br>  <br>  3. Also, trotting a fence is beneficial to maintaining control afterwards, ask her to trot a lap around the ring to have a controlled but open trot and then go to the jump.  If she canters before the jump, halt her (into the wall if you have to) turn her right around and  jump the fence the other way, if she canters, halt and do it over and over until she trots then let her trot after the fence and praise her (she will learn that trotting means she doesn't get yanked on after the fence).<br>  <br>  4. Also, everyone's suggestions are good, but you need to do more than one thing, including my method.  Do work as much as you can on transitions, the idea with transitions is to make sure she is listening to you so that even when she wants to go fast (after a jump for example) she will listen to your commands.  Circles also work well, particularly in jumping courses.  My mare would bolt down lines and my trainer had me circle inbetween each fence.  Use all of these methods to constantly keep her listening to what you want, not what she thinks she is supposed to do.  Switch it up so she doesn't start to anticipate things. <br>  <br>  If all else fails, take her to a professional to have her trained, it is expensive but worth it if you just can't do it yourself.  Good Luck!|`|BI1GbIZUaa	To stop it at the canter I would work on transitions. Keep changing it up so that if she;s cantering she has to be on top of her toes because you may ask her to walk or halt. Circles should slow her down as well. As for after a jump try halting in a straight line after your jumps. If you can bring her back before you turn the corner then don't halt as much.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	is she off the track?<br>  i would work more at the slower gaits and spend way more time lunging and working on voice commands.<br>  if she is off the track, as you know the harder you pull on the reins the faster she will go.<br>  spend more time doing transitions with a long, following rein.<br>  the half halts are good.  add halting by using your back only.<br>  i have found this very helpful for horses that get too quick.<br>  it will help solidify the half halts.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Horses learn to anticipate "what comes next" pretty quickly. Therefore, you need to make what your horse is anticipating be something quiet. Always trot her out to a stop after a jump during practice. Walk her around between jumps.<br>  <br>  In the canter, whenever she speeds up for even a stride, drop her to the trot for a few strides and then send her back to the canter. Repeat consistently, every time.<br>  <br>  Half halts can help but too many can give your horse mouth-shyness or create a fear that will also lead to speed. So you need to revisit the stop cue in hand and on lunge and under saddle at walk and trot. The horse needs to stop within a stride on lead line and a couple of strides on lunge before working under saddle. <br>  <br>  Under saddle, make sure you use a consistent "whoa" cue with legs open to stop the horse. Try to only use the reins when the horse does not respond. Only bump the horse's mouth for a stop when correcting like this. And remember, you have less than a second to correct the stop.<br>  <br>  Finally, many jumpers and english riders are putting too much force into contact, whether to get collection or out of anxiety that the horse will run off, or simply from not knowing. This is less of a problem for western riders who usually ride on loose rein. Keep in mind that if you are holding onto that horse with the reins while telling him to go, you are devaluing the reins as a stop cue. Ease up on the reins, even if it makes you afraid. You need to make the reins mean stop, not be something to be ignored.<br>  <br>  So if you have the stop working, the horse is being corrected every time she speeds up, and her expectation is that after a jump she gets to rest and relax and go slow - imagine how good she'll be after a few consistent weeks of this treatment.<br>  <br>  I work with reining horses, who have similar problems. Like jumpers and eventers they chain together fast manuevers that are close to the horse' s flight response. But reining horses are also required to hesitate for as long as five seconds between manuevers, which quickly reveals which horses have been trained like what I've descibed above and which have just been run and run.<br>  <br>  So I hope this helps. Best wishes to you and your horse!|`|m1TQuVkmaa	i would do a lot of one rein stops. as soon as she starts going faster than you asked her, then do a one rein stop. it will take awhile but it works.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Well this is a tough question to tackle! If your mare is taking off with your after the jump, then the easy answer is that she isn't ready to jump. Six years is still relatively young - she just finished growing at five. Take more time to cement your flatwork. My rule of thumb is this: if your horse is not able to remain calm and collected at the walk, trot, canter both directions in addition to knowing their downward transitions inside and out, then they are not ready to jump. So work some more on your canter transitions on the flat. After a few weeks try incorporating some canter poles and see how she does with those. Don't be afraid to go back a few steps. Rushing after the fences is only a precursor to rushing before them and that is something you definitely don't want.|`|gbaw9wHWaa	I've rode many horses that do this ...you have to teach them to collect and slow down... I use gymnastic jump grids, there are many books out on how to use them properly... Another thing that works great is after the jump when your horse begins to run away head straight for the fence at the end and stop her going straight into it ... after doing this a couple times she will realize that you are going to want her to to stop and she will slow down. once she has the hang of it you can stop stopping at the fence and just go around the corner like you usually do with the occasional halfhalts and she should stay at a mpore consistent canter for you!

Jack Russells are a high-energy breed and are notorious for digging, but if you can provide adequate exercise and don't have an issue with the dog possibly digging up your yard, that's nothing to worry about.  They are intelligent dogs, but can be aggressive if not properly trained and socialized.  One of my friends has a Jack Russell that I (in all honesty) find to be annoying (he's very vocal), but I suppose different people have different tolerance levels and tastes in pets.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that one breed that works well with children and families is the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  They are small, smart, and generally have good temperaments.  I used to work at a vet clinic, and the CKCs that were brought in for treatment were always easy to work with.|`|6zv7ezTeaa	I have a Jack Russell. He is really playful. I'm at school from 7 to 3 and he is fine in a kennel or in the back yard. Either way, he is really excited when I get home. Jacks love people, but they also love alone time. They just need like an hour or two of play time and then just want to sit in a corner with some toys (I.E. rope, stuffed animals, bones, tennis balls, etc...). They are only aggressive if you provoke them. And they are very intelligent!! Be sure to train her or else they will outsmart you. And my Jack loves children. He loves to cuddle and kiss. It's so cute. They are a lot of work at first; however, once they are trained, they are independent. Hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  Oh and people say that they are known for digging. That is true, but they need discipline. If they aren't disciplined they will dig and destroy. However, let them roam around your house. If you fence them off, then they will be curious and want to destroy to see. Blocking them off will provoke them. Oh and be sure to get them a collar. They are naturally hunting dogs and will run off if they see small animals. They are very fast too.

I had a couple of fish at different times that had dropsy and their scales didn't stick out like it says they should.  They just got very bloated.  I treated them with maracyn2 and they're both very alive today (that happened over a year ago)<br>  At this point, it wouldn't hurt to treat it with maracyn2 anyway.  It's cured alot of my fish that acted that way and I had no idea what was wrong with them.  One actually couldn't have been closer to death without being dead, seriously.  8 months ago and he's still going strong.<br>  You can get it at petco and petsmart.

I have bred Balinese for 36 years & am familiar w/ the color genetics.<br>  <br>  A red/flame father bred to a "standard color" female... all female offspring will be "torties". Tortie can be sometimes be used as a generic term, just like "kleenex". Torties come in several colors:<br>  Seal-Tortie (Black & Red)<br>  Chocolate-Tortie<br>  Blue-Cream (dilute of Seal-Tortie...

CkecSp4Uaa	That weight at that age sounds about ideal for most german shepherds.  If your vet is not concerned about the weight then you have nothing to worry about.  Keep in mind that shepherds were NEVER meant to be huge dogs.  The ideal weight range if you go based on height at the shoulders is about 65-90lbs.  Once you get above 85-90lbs you have a dog that is too big to do the work these dogs were originally bred to do.  At 14 weeks my male german shepherd was about 30lbs...but he has grown to be a full 2 inches too tall for the breed standard and is a lanky thing at 85lbs (and 3 years old).  If he hadn't been neutered so young and allowed to develop the secondary sex characteristics of a male he'd probably be 95-100lbs or more.  So your guy might be closer to 24 inches than 26 inches when he's done growing.  It'll be fine.  Unless you planned on showing and/or breeding it doesn't really matter how big he ends up being anyway.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	seems a bit on the smaller side especially for a male.  is he skinny? have you had a vet look at him? <br>  he has about 2 more month of rapid growth.  maybe 3.  but he is not even half the size he will be when full grown.  i would have a vet look at him to make sure he is not 2 thin|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	That sounds perfectly normal.  I'm glad to hear from the poster above me...male GSD's should be 24" to 26" maximum at the withers and around 80 to 90 lb.  They are not supposed to be giant 120 lb dogs.  I had a male and female from very excellent German lines and often would get questions from total strangers on the street about my dogs being 'small' even though they were perfect.|`|gxzJ4lxhaa	Contrary to popular belief, the German Shepherd is a relatively small dog. Given the right diet and excercise it will grow to a reasonable size.The dog will not be fully grown until about 18 months.|`|L22hVXTIaa	That sounds about right.  But, remember, this dog will continue to grow until he's around 18 months old, so he's well on his way.  Also, GSD's tend to hit a growth spurt at about 6-8 months.  I think he'll mature out to a very nice size dog.
vtkuEr5Kaa	First of all, congratulations! Twenty-two months is a wonderful age for a child!<br>  <br>  Secondly, I certainly don't think you should feel guilty. You've got a child, who, as you now know, is the most important thing in your life, and requires a large amount of attention at that young age.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, you're giving the cat to a co-worker who, from what you have said, is a good person for the job. Besides, from my personal experience with my cats, they are happier in pairs.<br>  <br>  So, IMHO, I think there should be absolutely nothing to feel guilty about, especially considering you're doing what is fair for both your cat, and for your baby.<br>  <br>  Above all, good luck!|`|se27sAUwaa	Go for it. If you know your cat will be well cared for then you should have no worries. And hey! - it works for everyone. You and your son won't be worrying about kitty bites, your co-worker will be so excited to have a new addition to her house, and now your cat has a playmate (since your co-worker has another cat). I'm so glad your cat is going to a friend instead of the scary shelter.|`|o6aRMJaDaa	If this a friend that will give your cat a loving home and you can see her sometimes I wouldn't. The health of you baby is really important. If you want to keep your kitty you should look some things up to help your kitty settle down. She use to be the center of attention and now she isn't.  The internet is wonderful and has helped us resolve many of our cats problems. Good Luck!|`|bMYw17ORaa	animals have feelings too.<br>  <br>  to the cat, its just like your giving the baby away at age 7, the cat has spent all its life there, and your just gonna get rid of it because you have a baby.<br>  <br>  so yeah you should feel awful.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that you shouldn't feel guilty you are just doing what you feel is right. Since you are giving her to a coworker I am sure that you can go visit her if you want. Don't beat yourself up over this.|`|eHrc9NPcaa	no its either your cat or your baby and i don't think your going to give your baby away. no i don't think you should feel bad especially if shes going to a great home.|`|JbBCuYI5aa	let the cat and baby fight and whoever wins you should keep|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	poor kitty!

I feel sorry for what this cat has gone through.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	You cat if jealous of your baby. I know you feel bad, but you either need to give the cat away or keep him away from the baby. You can try scolding the cat when he does things like that. Maybe that will keep him away from the baby. Let him know that the baby is off limits. You can get a spray bottle and fill it with water and when he gets close to the baby, spray him. He will leave. Do that 2 or 3 times and he will probably get the hint.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Declawed cats can develop behavioural problems like biting unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Yes give the cat to your co-worker, where she can have some love and attention.    She will soon settle in.   It doesn't sound as if she is very happy where she is.<br>  <br>  You have 2 young children to look after so you will not have much time for your cat.   It could be nice for her to have the company of another cat as well.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	You should not feel guilty. If your co-worker is willing to take your cat, that is great. You can go visit him when she is home. You also don't want your baby to be scared of cats and dogs either. Don't listen to these mean people on here, I bet some don't have a cat and they are just saying mean things to you. Also I adopted a cat that was declawed  and she is perfectly fine, happy and playful. I wish you the best, maybe when your baby is older, you can get another kitten or cat from the shelter. Good Luck!!  :o)|`|hl4kkvXhaa	You have no reason to feel guilty.  You're doing what you need to do to make both your child and your cat as comfortable as they can be, and there's nothing wrong with that.  <br>  <br>  Your cat is having integration problems, and seems to be jealous of your son, or maybe she just doesn't understand that she can't play and bite your son the way she can do with you.  If she's jealous, then she's not feeling happy, so a new home with no babies will be the best thing for her.  Some cats just aren't suited to be around babies and small children.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that the woman who wants him understands that he's declawed, so if the other cat isn't, and they have problems getting along, she may need to separate them for a while because declawed cats have a harder time fighting back.  That's one of the problems with declawing, along with issues similar to what you are having to deal with.  Declawing can be mentally distressing for a kitten or cat, and many tend to have problems with aggressiveness...some vets are now refusing to do the procedure at all due to the mental effects it can have on cats.  <br>  <br>  You've found him a good home...and your son will have peace, and so should you.  It sounds like you've made the right decision because this woman really wants him, and sounds like she's willing to deal with his "quirks".  :)|`|w1lh1INHaa	I think, under the circumstances, letting your co-worker take the cat might be a good idea.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, biting is common in a cat that has been declawed, as it no longer has claws for defenses.  I have adopted and fostered declawed cats and frequently wondered whether this aggressive hand biting wasn't a form of communication from the cat, relating its displeasure or discomfort from having its fingers' amputated and wants humans to experience the same.   I have noticed great improvement in personality when a declawed cat is removed from the home that declawed it; they associate the declawing with the family or home, but a new one does not carry that association.  That said, I think it would be a good idea for everyone to rehome the cat.<br>  <br>  So no, you shouldn't feel guilty about giving her up.  It is much better for the cat, and certainly your family.|`|wnnudNp5aa	I would feel guilty giving my cat away, but under the circumstances, I think it's for the best. Your cat is suffering from sibling rivalry. Since she hasn't made peace with the "intruder" in 22 months, I doubt she ever will. It is likely with the baby, you don't give the cat the time and attention you used to. Since it sounds like your co-worker will give the cat plenty of love and attention, I think it will be a win-win solution.|`|H7HZXTaWaa	I think that you are doing the right thing, the cat is not going to a shelter where it will be euthanized, but to a loving home.  Being that you know the person taking your cat you could go visit her.  You need to protact your baby, and trying to keep your cat away from him 24/7 is next to impossible.  Your baby will be safer and your cat will be happier.  Don't feel guilty, be proud of yourself for making the right decision to a tough situation.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	No you are doing the right thing.  Instead of just dropping her off at an overcrowded shelter your giving her to a home you know will be good.  She will adjust and live a fine life.  If you still crave a pet when your son gets older try for another cat perhaps.  Kudos for not just dropping him, off at a shelter.|`|a603ba6ddc23b804b5da9ebcdd35be35aa	NO!  You shouldn't feel guilty if the cat is biting your baby.  Cats are not humans and they shouldn't be treated like them.  If your coworker wants one you should give it to her.  I'm sure it would be much happier in her home.  Hope I helped!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	The cat might be happier.  Though you probably don't want to hear it, this most likely could have been avoided by not having the cat declawed.  Declawed cats almost always end up with some degree of behavioral issues after surgery.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	If your coworker can give your cat a better home than you can, then I think it is for the best.  And sounds like she can under the circumstances.|`|pegSqlMBaa	Do not feel guilty. Your baby needs to be secure and safe in his home. Your cat will be fine. With that type of personality I'm sure she is very strong minded. Good luck.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	You should feel more guilty about having had her declawed than giving her to a good home where she will be loved.
5QG9Zrjaaa	Unfortunately, the only way to get rid of the marks is to re-dye the seat, and to do that, you have to remove all the finish, dye, and then try to refinish the leather which is usually done prior to assembly of the saddle.  It is hard to get it to take up the dye evenly as any place that has been polished by pressure (seat bones for example) will not take up the dye.  <br>  <br>  Black is really hard to get right.  For whatever reason, the dye is really, really dark green, not black at all, so when the sun bleaches it, it turns green.  <br>  <br>  If the rub marks are under your tush,when you are in the saddle, the marks will be hidden =)  If they are small scratches or small areas on the edges, I have used a black sharpie for touch ups.  Then I put on leather conditioner, and it seems to help for awhile.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	if the mark is on the seat and you use a colored polish it will rub off quickly (right onto the seat of your pants!)|`|ZGiVn4MUaa	get bees waxy it will make it darker plus it will water profe it nd it wont come off on ur jeans

4fd61aa12bd580a01c2f3784f70c97d2aa	Years ago we had a male dog that had this issue, what the problems was is that the medication did not clear the whole infection up and we had to treat him several times with antibiotics and have the glands express several times in the process.

You should ask your vet about that possibility.  Here is some more good info for you:<br>  <br>  "It's believed that dog anal gland problems can be linked to the quality of pet food a dog receives. Inexpensive brands of dog food use a lot of cereal fillers, which tend to make soft stools. The soft stool isn't able to press firmly enough against the dog's anal glands to provide the necessary pressure to express them, and there the trouble begins. Higher quality dog foods that produce a firmer, more compact stool actually aid the expressing of dog anal glands and, therefore, may be a better food choice for your pet."|`|XDvgnNaFaa	I have been battling this anal gland problem for quite some time. My dogs problem is with the internal glands and they fill monthly. My dog will literally chew his foot pads off b/c it irritates him so much. I've been taking him to the vet to be expressed but that is getting expensive $25/per visit!  I have tried EVERYTHING; increased fiber, special dog foods, special diet, holistic treatments (acupuncture).  My vet has suggested many times to have them removed - I'm just not ready yet.  Does anyone know where to locate directions for expressing internal glands is?|`|kAKikbqLaa	i work at a Pet groomers and we do the Anal Glands.

You should only empty you dogs glands 1 a month if not lest like every 2 months because they are soft tissue and they can rupture.<br>  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  PS- when you do them yourself be VERY gentel, like i said they can rupsure VERY easily.

3HNXdmFmaa	As far as I know, there haven't been any breeds banned anywhere in this country except fighting breeds such as American pit bull terriers, staffordshire terriers, etc., and certain breeds commonly used for protection such as rottweilers and German shepherds.<br>  <br>  I cannot imagine any state, country or local government specifically banning a northern Inuit, but the chances of the dog being mistaken for a wolf or wolf hybrid are great, and that could become a problem in some areas.<br>  <br>  I would call several CT branches of the Humane Society and the ASPCA, as well as some of the local county and city dog shelters.  These people are more likely to have the scoop on the laws in your area on wolf hybrids, and whether a Northern Inuit pedigree would be sufficient proof that your dog is a domestic dog and not a hybrid.  <br>  <br>  If you find that wolf hybrids are persecuted in your area, you might check with some vets to see if they offer the DNA test like the Canine Heritage Panel and Wisdom Test that can now detect specific breeds in a mix breed.  This test might be able to offer proof that your Inuit isn't a hybrid.  This documentation, the pedigree, and purchase paperwork could one day be very useful in protecting your dog if he or she is ever picked up as a stray, or bites another animal or human.  <br>  <br>  I like to think we're more enlightened these days, but there was a time when some agencies automatically euthanized any dog that LOOKED like a wolf hybrid.  Those were the days when we didn't have DNA tests to tell the difference too though.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your dog!|`|Wo6Xer92aa	I wish I had a a northern inuit dog.

qOyF36Htaa	they will only hatch if they are fertilized, and you need to turn the eggs 45 degrees every few hours, always keep the large end up, so when its laying flat on its side turn it back to the large end is up then lay it down on the other side, then go back to the top so that the developing chick doesn't stick to the inside of the egg, also make sure that the large end is placed up other the chick will die when it tries to hatch. the chick will hatch about 21 days from when you started incubating it. to make things easy just get a normal egg carton put the eggs large end up in there and tilt from side to side to rotate the eggs. after day 19 leave the egg alone.if you want to see if they are developing wait until day 6 and put a toilet paper roll on the end of a flashlight and then put the egg up to the open end of the toilet paper roll if you see red inside the egg when you turn on the flashlight you know that it is developing. hope this helps|`|rTOuZYyjaa	we had about 2 dozen chickens that had laid eggs we just left them in there pins with 2 roosters next 2-4 months we had lil chiks running around it's hard to catch'em when there in a big pin|`|mLabzxnIaa	haha you live on a farm.

A shelter would know that these are red flags - as far as sites like CL go, post a warning about how important it is to do a home check, check vet refs, etc.  It will most likely be flagged, but keep posting as it is important info.

3OFhCEEwaa	My young male guinea pig was exactly the same, but he was also nervous when i held him and when he was with other guinea pigs.

She needs an x-ray to determine number of puppies, and i would talk to the vet about how to spot complications and what to do in case of them.<br>  <br>  Just so you know, she could very well die if you don't. And she could very well not take care of the litter, which puts YOU on the spot for bottle feeding around the clock as well as stimulating them to potty. If you're not ready to spend a couple grand then i would see if spaying is possible right now, or you'll just have to dish out the dough like a responsible dog owner (you know, make up for NOT being one while she was in heat.)|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Why would you leave a b*tch in season outside unsupervised?

If she is then learn all you can on whelping puppies, start finding homes for them now if you can and then schedule her to get spayed once the pups are weaned.|`|AA11244754	yes, your vet can, take her to him and get her checked out, also that way she can get a thorough prenatal check and you will be given a due date if she is.

Welcome to the world of dog parenting and teenagers who must be more responsible due to disabled/terminally ill parents.  First, make sure that she is on a good quality dog food.  Maybe switching her food to puppy food (as it's has denser nutrients which mother dogs need more of while pregnant and nursing) would be advisable.  As her due date draws closer, she will need smaller (but more frequent) meals, for her developing puppies will take up most of her stomach space near the time she delivers.  <br>  <br>  As the pregnancy progresses, discourage her from jumping.  By the way, not all 'human foods' are bad for dogs.  Adding some cottage cheese, raw egg, chicken, or turkey could supplement her diet and provide her with extra nutrition.  <br>  <br>  When the puppies are delivered, they will be blind and deaf.  Sight begins to develop at 10 to 14 days and the puppies should be hearing by 17 days.  Introduce solid food at four weeks, but do not fully wean the pups until 7 to 8 weeks.  This said, the puppies should go to their new homes at eight weeks.  No sooner, for puppies can have behavior problems later in life if taken from their mothers too early. <br>  <br>  Yes, spay her after the pups are weaned to prevent this from happening again.  Good luck!|`|koVk3P9Gaa	1st thing, What breed and size is your dog.<br>  2nd thing, Do you what size the 2 males are that got to her?  It's important because if the male is alot bigger than your female, she could have MAJOR trouble giving birth, possibly die.  You also need to start taking her temp.  If it gets around 98 or higher, she will probably go into labor within 24 hours.<br>  <br>  You really should get an x-ray, that can help determine how big her pelvic area is, and possible see how many pups she may have.  You also need to get a whelping box, lots of blankets, a heating pad (goes under the blanket) or a heat lamp.  Also get some sort of puppy bottles, in case she isn't able to feed them.  You are in for alot of stress, newborn puppies are such a handful.  Good luck.
nY1nq9hCaa	Yes, as long as nothing will make it be harmed like exposed cables etc it should be fine.  You can still give it reasonable love and care around your life.  <br>  <br>  Some people here forget these are animals not humans and a lot will tell you its wrong.<br>  <br>  Make sure you still give it training every day and socialise with different things like out door walks in towns and children etc so it become sociable and not frightened which can lead to aggression|`|9kTejB0uaa	Well he'll be okay in that, with luck, he probably won't die.  However, bringing a puppy into your lives at the moment is far from ideal.  Why?  For starters, it's going to take forever to house-train your puppy.  He will, initially, be terribly lonely and won't understand what's happened to him.  Coming from living with his litter mates into a house where he's expected to be alone for up to, potentially 5 hours during the working week.  He may well become very reclusive, destructive and noisy.<br>  <br>  Once he's an adult this may well work out fine, but this is not the way to start off, with a puppy.  I suggest you reconsider and if you really want a dog in your lives at the moment, look at finding a young adult.<br>  <br>  ps  It's fine to leave an adult dog for up to 4 hours at a time but coming from the perspective of a breeder, personally I'd weep to think that one of my precious pups, who I'd spent 24/7 with from the time he was born, was going to end up being completely on his own for this amount of time during a day - particularly the possible 4 hours!  That's plenty of time for a puppy to get into all kinds of stuff, even with the best will, crate etc.  Imagine if he chewed up his blanket and it got stuck in his throat - or even a toy ..... it can, and does happen.  If we are talking about an 8 - 10 week old puppy, this just isn't on!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Yes, that will be ok, but I would recommend using a crate and not leaving the pup in the kitchen.  A child gate won't always keep a pup in and there's a lot of things in a house and especially in the kitchen that a pup could get into.  It would be safer in a crate while you're away and so long as it's not there over 4 hours, it's fine.|`|hNCiw6Laaa	He will grow to accept this is the norm okay...PLENTY of toys and stimulants and he will be fine okay...Dogs are pretty stupid and dont possess the complexities that we have...|`|GTJf4FKRaa	i think this is okay, but if you could find a better alternative as to have the puppy watched under some guidancee it would be better. He/she (the dog) could have guidance so that once its older it will understand what to do and what not to do. Try to not neglect your animal as much as possible since they need the love and nurishment as much as you can offer them. They are affectionate animals and as a puppy they will grow on what you teach them,so when they are older they won't have to be taught anything. I think leaving them in your kitchen with food and water is fine, athough puppys have a tendency to use the restroom alot, probably the only downfall with that plan.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	Yes thats fine... you may find that the toilet training will be a bit slow if you do this straight off, with a few accidents. But as the pup grows they will be able to hold it longer... :)<br>  If you can take a couple of weeks off when you first get the pup you can get into a good potty training routine will help greatly<br>  But 4 hours alone is fine imho|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Oh my god 4 whole hours, but seriously most people have to work 8 hours a day and they still get puppies all the time.  I think that will be fine.  Get a crate or cage for your puppy to stay in when it is alone.  They can get into trouble loose in the house.|`|B1UcaukFaa	I would try crate training before going to the kitchen.  The crate also becomes their "den" so many dogs take to this.  I do this with my dog and she has been doing great.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/dog_behavior_tip_sheets/crate_training.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...</a>|`|0f644b00eccc311534ab8fe88a3eb455aa	yes, as long as the house is puppy safe. i like those baby fences, so he wont get to stuff that is of value and he wont swallow stuff. my uncle does that. <br>  and seems as long as he has his doggy essentials, he'll be fine|`|kvHqnR5Haa	That is ok to leave him for that amount of time but I would suggest a crate.  They feel much safer in a crate once they are used to them and they are less likely to have accidents.  Good luck!|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	& just did you imagine you were ever going to work clean eat sleep take a bath,...do ANYTHING w/out having it tied to you w/an UMBILICAL CORD????<br>  <br>  Of course it can!<br>  CRATE it-not leave it loose to ****&piss everywhere!|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Yes this is fine! 4 hours is not too long and it sounds like you will be there most of the time.|`|X2h9AU9Zaa	That won't be a problem.  I also suggest crate training as it will keep the puppy out of trouble while you are gone.  Having your dog crate trained also comes in useful when you have to have strangers (repairmen, etc.) come into your home.  My Shi Tzu - Poodle mix automatically goes into his crate when he sees "mom" fixing her thermos!  The beagle-terrier mix still balks on occasion, but once she's in the crate, she's fine.  Just be sure that the pup gets lots of attention and exercise otherwise.  Good luck.|`|ZpYqeeuDaa	The RSPCA gives guidelines of not leaving a pup for more then 4 hours a day so I think you'll be fine, it's better to get it in some kind of routine which is what it looks like you will do. I have a dogflap, like a catflap but for the dog!! So it can go out to the garden anytime it likes, if this would work in your house then I would definately recommend one, they're only about ￡15.|`|NOUluYJ3aa	hi,i don't think it would be fair to keep a puppy/dog on its own for that long.you will also have no house left as it will get bored and chew everything.dogs like company and 4hrs is a long time to a young dog.|`|B2yFG17zaa	yes, as long as there's nothing it can chock on, and make sure it cant get out|`|vXWvCA74aa	yes if your leave it on its own every daii it willl get used to it <br>  good luck xx|`|9L0chuBkaa	you have to put them in in a small place first.|`|AA12128656	yes, that's totally fine. while the pup is very young, a gated off area like laundry room is good. when the pup is 4-5 months old, use a crate instead for the 4 hours you will be away. this will help puppy be secure while you are gone, and reinforce good housebreaking habits.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Don't forget there is your social life to consider plus time to shop etc., Four hours is too long to leave a new puppy and you will need to be at home for the first two weeks. This will help your puppy to settle in however it will be months before it will be potty/house trained. If it is left alone it could take forever to train it.I adore puppies, however they can be a  pain in the bum if you are limited for time.<br>  <br>  A puppy will howl and scream if you leave it alone for four hours. If you are in rented accommodation the other tenants will complain. This could result in eviction and where will you find a new landlord who will take you and your dog.<br>  <br>  Some of the uncaring answerer's will suggest a crate to stop you dog from doing  damage. Unfortunately this results in bladder and bowel problems and it does not stop a puppy from howling.<br>  <br>  New puppies need to be fed four times a day, they often need expensive veterinary care and eventually they will need long walks before you go to work. If a puppy is left alone for this length of time itt will become an anti social hooligan. If you can pay someone to take your puppy out, or take it to a day creche it will help. Regardless of this there are other expenses to consider.<br>  Get a cat instead.
AA10332192	First I will start with your questions.<br>  <br>  1) No, there were none to begin with.  Not even eggs most likely<br>  2) No, first there would be eggs followed by fry, but based on your detailed observations, I doubt they had eggs even<br>  3) No.<br>  <br>  So, I like to condition my females on high quality foods for at least 30 days before mating.  That would be a variety of diets like blood worms, shrimp, algae, etc.  You should introduce her when you see her gravid with eggs, about once a month for a healthy female.<br>  <br>  That is when you introduce her, and leave her for 12 hours or so.<br>  <br>  A 1 gallon bowl is not ideal for breeding.  I suggest a 5 gallon tank at a minimum, 10 gallons is better as you can add filtration as the fry develop.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are doing well getting info before hand and being detailed in your observations.  Keep a journal of this, and it will help you in the future.<br>  <br>  Do a web search for Betta breeding and there are some great resources on the web for it as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	1.

There were no eggs in the first place and u cannot breed them in a bowl. A 10 gallon tank is perfect for breeding them, but as Mad Scientist said a 5 gallon is the least u should breed them in.<br>  <br>  There needs to be adequate time for them to become acquainted outside the breeding tank of at least 2 days to see if they actually have interest in one another.<br>  <br>  Another thing is the tank needs to be properly set up with the correct temperature. It needs a heater set at 80 degrees, aquarium salt and a few other things that you can learn about using the link below.

vS1Z0inOaa	First of all, what were your temps? The water needs to be at around 75 degrees and the basking dock at 90 degrees. There must be at least a 10 degree difference between the water temp and the basking temp or the turtle's digestive and immune systems will not function properly.<br>     Secondly, what were you feeding them? And are you sure they were eating? They should be eating mostly live whole food like feeder minnows, earthworms, and gutloaded crickets supplemented with greens like watercress, turnip greens, kale, endive, spring mix (bagged salad mix), shredded carrots, and occasionally romaine and some pellet food like ReptoMin sticks or cichlid food.<br>     Third, was the basking dock completely dry? Turtles need to be able to dry off completely, including the bottom shell, to be able to prevent shell rot. Drying off under the hot lamp kills off algae, fungi and bacteria that can cause shell rot. Many keepers make the mistake of allowing the entire dock to be slightly submerged so the turtle's ottom shell is still in the water when they sit on it.<br>     Fourth, was the water adequately filtered? Turtles are very messy so the filter needs to be rated for 2 to 3 times the amount of water to be able to clean it adequately. So, for example, if you're keeping them in a 10 gallon aquarium your filter should be rated for 20 to 30 gallons at least. Also filters do not clean up the leftover mess from feeding in the tank, so it's advised you feed them in a separate bowl.<br>     Finally, shell rot is usually not orange spots... It's usually white fuzzy spots on the shell, yellowish crusty shell with parts of it looking dry or dead, or scutes (scales) falling off to reveal red, moist, raw areas and a foul smell. To address thee problems, bathing in betadine is not enough. You would also need to dry dock him, keeping him out of the water and warm for 20 hours a day at least.<br>     I'm not sure what you mean by orange spots on his skin or what that means... The closest thing I can think of is... Did he have unpatterned red spots on his bottom shell? That would mean he had septicemia, a blood infection that is fatal and possibly could not have been treated anyway. Many times the only symptoms of septicemia is those UNpatterned red spots (caused by bleeding underneath the shell) and being less active, and those show up pretty late into the illness. Or, did he have raw sores on his skin? That could be a symptom of a vitamin A deficiency which is pretty uncommon, but if they weren't cared for well before you got them or weren't eating well or being fed the proper diet it can happen.
cj31x3UMaa	If he can walk a straight line w/out falling over, then it is safe for him to eat & drink again.<br>  <br>  Post op instructions are generally to with hold all food & water until next day.<br>  ---------------------------------<br>  KITTENS are still growing, so to suddenly reduce his food to 1/4 of what he is used to eating could cause malnutrition.<br>  <br>  OTH - Altered animals burn fewer calories, so you reduce the amount of calories to avoid them getting fat.<br>  <br>  The trick is to strike a happy medium. If your kitten is one that only eats what he needs, when he needs it & often leaves dry food in his dish - you probably will not need to worry re: him getting fat. If he ALWAYS eats everything you put down, you need to watch his diet. <br>  <br>  Canned pumpkin (no spice) has lots of vitamins & fiber, low in calories & is good for hairballs, diarrhea & constipation. Read the label on the dry food bag & see what is recommended for daily feeding for your kitten's age. If he still acts like he is starving, give him pumpkin... if he eats too much it looks like orange crayons in the litter box, but will not hurt anything. Give him a tablespoon every day no matter what for hairballs.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	My vet fed my cat while he was still there!  If he's hungry, go ahead and feed him the normal amount (in total, don't overdo it).  They only caution that because (1) some cats get upset stomachs from the anesthesia and (2) what goes in must come out, imagine how that will feel on his poor little booty.<br>  <br>  My cats have never had a problem though.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	You can gradually start upping his food amount every day until you get back to the usual amount. This will not hurt him. They just have you lower the food amount because of recent surgery so he wouldn't get sick.

This does not always happen, but I have seen it in 2 cats with broken tails.<br>  <br>  For a break high up there is very little a vet can do.    It is best to see if it will heal on it's own.     There is no likelyhood of infection unless there is also an open wound in the area.<br>  <br>  Hopefully the tail will heal on it's own, an amputation would be a last resort.<br>  <br>  I would try to keep your cat fairly quiet for the first week.   Keep him indoors and hopefully he will sleep a lot and give the tail a chance to begin healing.<br>  <br>  I hope your cat will be okay.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	Chances are if you don't take him to the vet and there was trauma, his tail can just die and fall off (Ive seen it happen) The are perfectly fine after.

Depending on exactly where the break it might determine if it should be removed or not. If it doesn't get any better think about all the trouble you kitty could be in if it drags everywhere. <br>  I hope everything goes OK and your kittie continues to live a great life.|`|se27sAUwaa	Take him to the Vet. The worst thing you could do is just "wait and see". If you love your animal, you'll take him in. You don't know what's been damaged and the severity of his suffering.

Tail damage can cause trauma, by skin or tissue movement, to the cats genitalia which in turn could lead to bowel infection of worse.

That's an old dog, a senior citizen.  You need to consider what old age brings - blindness, deafness, increased irritability and memory less, etc.  If your dog is being bothered by these things, leave him alone!  If his eyesight or hearing has deteriorated, then he is likely being caught by surprise and is initially frightened, not aggressive.<br>  <br>  Dogs don't need a bath more than 3-4 times a year anyways.  If you want him to look a certain way, you can certainly ask for grooming tips to do it yourself.  He is an old man and would rather take it easy than be bothered with.  Let him live his golden years in peace!|`|MLC97M1Baa	Your dog is not disobedient, it has a negative association with the groomer. Find out what triggers the behaviour. The brushes, the salon, the people, the muzzle, the needles ... to your dog these things mean BAD. Create positive experiences with the tools by feeding near them, praising and rewarding when the dog goes near them, make everything happy go lucky. Play with his fav toy when he gets near them voluntarily. If he is not scared of the brushes, do it with what he considers to be negative. Good luck and remember it is not the dogs fault. Since he is an older dog, this behaviour has been reinforced and is implented. It will take some time.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	At 13.5 ... I wouldn't even attempt to address it.  The dog is a senior and probably doesn't feel great to begin with.  That's probably why he's biting.  Knocking him out, while not the perfect solution, is probably the best one.|`|OxFsslN8aa	I agree with Tash.  You need to purchase a muzzle & introduce it to him positively.  Put a treat inside the muzzle & let the dog eat it out of the muzzle without buckling it around his head.  Do this about 10 times for about three days before you want to use it for bathing & grooming.  When you finally are going to buckle it onto him, put a treat inside & buckle it.  Good luck.
L22hVXTIaa	First of all - there is no such thing as "teacup" anything - there that makes 1,001 times I've had to write that.  Anyway, if you want a very small dog, you should look at the toy breeds - Chihuahua, Yorkshire Terrier, Papillon, Maltese, Pomeranian, Toy Fox Terrier, Toy Poodle, etc.  There are dozens.  You can also get a small mixed breed dog from your local shelter and save a lot of money over buying a purebred.  Also, if you pick an adult dog at the shelter, you will be able to see his full grown size and check out his fur.  You'll also be saving a life - and that's the very best part!  Good luck!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You do NOT want to buy a teacup any breed of dog.  They are nothing more then undersize runts bred together, no testing, not to the standard and full of medical problems.

They often have serious health problems and have shorter than average lifespans.  A small toy breed that meets the breed standard would fit your size requirements.  Chihuahuas, Yorkies and many other small breeds are in that size range according to their breed standards. Do your research and stay away from anyone that advertises anything "teacup" or "tiny."  It's asking for a rip-off and heartache.|`|cSOwqXKxaa	So . . . . you DO know that a puppy is baby dog, and that all baby dogs grow up and bark, pee, poop, bite, and generally act like animals?

Do you not even read what you post??  Your 'literature' states: "Unlike the standard Poodle, the miniature Poodle and the toy Poodle, this version cannot jump off of a sofa or bed, and cannot climb stairs. Because they are so small, they cannot play with other animals. The most dangerous factor of their size is their lack of body fat. Fat helps keep the body warm and stores energy."  That is NOT a dog!!  Dogs are hardy creatures that can play, explore, sniff around in the woods, and run and jump to their heart's content!

AM7CgQ4daa	First determine what you want from the pup,  pet only or do you want to do either sports or conformation?     If you want to do agility, tracking etc, it is important not to get a dog bred for the showing, as these dogs normally have a more sloping back which can affect there performance.   You should also explore the area of American dogs and European dogs.<br>  I would normally recommend getting a dog from a working line, which means the breeders should be doing activities such as agility, fly ball, tracking etc.<br>  I normally start looking by searching the internet for websites, if the breeders do no activities I cross them off my list.<br>  If the website does not contain information on the breeding history (3 generations) or hip/elbow scores, I cross them off my list.<br>  The best thing to do is look at lots of websites,   look at the way the dogs stand and the sloping backs.    After a while you will get a good idea of a good website with good looking dogs, and a poorer specimen.<br>  It is still important to go visit the dogs yourself, to test the temperament and to see the test results of the dogs.  It is easy to produce a good web page, so this is just a start.<br>  I have supplied a web page on american v European dogs,  show dogs vs work dogs, and a website on genetic health problems|`|L22hVXTIaa	First check with a local AKC German Shepherd club to find out who the most reputable breeders are.  Try to attend a show in your area to see which dogs are performing well.  Then, arm yourself with knowledge.  By that I mean read everything you can about GSD's so that you will recognize a nice pup when you see one.  Talk to the breeders and trainers at these shows - they will steer you in the right direction.  Remember, though, you're looking for temperament as much as physical beauty.  Hope you find the right dog for your.|`|cSOwqXKxaa	I'm not overly familiar with the culture of German shepherd breeders, but I do suggest every potential Pet Parent take a peek at this link:  <a href="http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/goodbreeders.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowisconsinpuppymills.com/goo...</a>  If your breeder doesn't fit these qualifications, then look elsewhere.

Find a breeder that's breeding working/protection dogs.  Temperament is SO important for these kinds of dogs that the breeders take special care in that area.  And yes, protection dogs must be well balanced when it comes to temperment.  These people do not try to breed aggressive dogs.
omBhu3gjaa	the second one is by far the better deal as for how much bang for your buck you would get. first a 24 gallon tank is obviously much smaller than the 115 which would be sweet but doesnt come with what you need. and althouggh fresh water tanks can be awesome, i think i could stare at a salt water tank for hours before getting bored cus they are that sweet. you could get the 115 gallon and make a saltwater tank, but with our all the stuff you need your gonna be jumping into a big expensive project. depending on if you would by used or new equipment the price of equipment for a salt water tank compared to that of a freshwater is much much much more. for instance, a freshwater tank basically requires a filter and heater. a salt water tank  requires a much better filter, high end quality uv lights, protein skimmers, and much more including chemicals that you wouldnt need for a fresh water tank. plus an average freshwater fish might cost 5 dollars while an averaage saltwater fish would be 50 bucks. so the fact that this deal comes with all of the tank, lights, eqiupment, livestock, sand , and rocks is an incredible deal. for instance live rock and sand can range from 4-6 dollars a pound. so i think this is the better deal as it comes with everything you need and you wont really need to invest more money into it once you get. one the other hand the 115 gallon tank is a much largere tank that you could fill with some really sweet freshwater fish or invest into and make an even better salwater tank. i dont know where you found this deal but i would definitely get the saltwater tank|`|K4rP4A0naa	The only difference between a FW and SW tank is that SW tanks often have weirs that drain into a sump. They don't have to though.<br>  <br>  The equipment you need is what makes the difference. Especially if you want corals and inverts. If you just want fish the only difference is you need saltwater and a heater.<br>  <br>  You'd have to use live rock as your filter on a 115G tank and would need at least 100lbs which would cost a fortune. If you want corals expect to pay a few hundred at least on lighting. The more advanced you go the more it costs.<br>  <br>  If you're new to SW you'd best get that 24G tank. That's a good first SW setup at a good price.|`|9c244bfee8268997c7b51bbd821a11f2aa	I agree, the saltwater is the better deal.  24 gallon is smaller, but keep in mind that if you have a 115gallon tank, that is heavy enough that you will have to make sure you have shored up your floor unless it will be kept in the basement or ground floor of your house (i.e. nothing but cement under it).  115gallon is a heavy beast.  24 gallon is a good size for salt to start with, and you can upgrade when you get the hang of it.  Keeping a salt tank is a hobby that takes time and money. I LOVE my 30 gallon salt, wouldn't trade it for a boring freshwater ever.  The salt deal comes with everything you need and it is probably upwards of $1000 worth of stuff.  For $200, that's a steal.  Take it before it's gone!|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	here is the real answer, sure looks like the second one IF you were planning on just keeping those three fish, although i don't think the tomato clowns is going to like sharing a 24 gal with any other clown other than his mate,<br>  <br>  and why is its really not the better deal?<br>  <br>  because you either have the saltwater bug or you don't, if you don't then with in a year your going to decide that the money and time for upkeep isn't worth it and you'll quit the hobey, if you do have the bug then with in a year your going to decide that a 24 gal sucks and you want a bigger tank because you don't have enough room for all the fish and coral you want, <br>  <br>  in either case in a year your going to end up scrapping that 24gal|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	If you really want to do salt water you HAVE To go with the big tank.  The more water the easier it is to keep the salinity and condition right. Smaller tanks you have no room for error. Also most salt water fish need a 55+ tank.  <br>  <br>  Salt water tanks are going to coast more to set up, stock, run, and check. <br>  <br>  24 gal is good for fresh water but it is not going to be a good tank to start salt water with.

And, it takes a while to kill off the worms so the dog will continue to pass them in his stools as his system and the medicine slowly flush them out - sometimes that can take up to two weeks after the last dose.  However, at the end of that time, you can check with your vet since it's possible he may need another course of meds.  Good luck and be patient.|`|7d4ibEnKaa	They're probably dying.

bFzu835Aaa	Generally hand feeding needs to be a well prepared operation. By 10-14 days the chicks should be pulled for the best adaptation to the syringe. It does take them a little to get used to it initially.<br>  <br>  Since you don't know the exact age, or really seem to know exactly what to do, I'd suggest letting the parents finish feeding the chicks (it can be very easy to injure or kill a young chick if you don't know what you're doing handfeeding) and you simply take them out a few times a day and handle them. In the meantime, find a breeder in your area that can show you the proper techniques and help you get set up for NEXT time your birds breed (which should be at least 6 months from now so they can be in top condition before they go through the stress again!).|`|onQgOw8naa	i know how to fry them... crispy or original?|`|09e41Hdwaa	If you don't know how to hand feed then let the parents do it.

Get a dog crate that is big enough to hold her, her food and water, and her litter box and set her up with some nice comfy blankets. You should also try to buy Feliway, which is a pheromone diffuser that helps cats calm down. <br>  <br>  Secondly, please get your cat spayed. If she is not spayed, she will keep going in to heat and will continue to be loud and annoying. Spaying her will calm this down, as well as cut her roaming instincts and territorial instincts back. Plus, she won't get pregnant and add to the unwanted pet population. <br>  Call your local animal shelters and vet offices and ask about low cost spay and neuter clinics in your area. There are many places that will spay or neuter for under $100.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	You need to make an appointment with the vet, and make sure she doesn't get loose! <br>  <br>  Spaying/neutering not only prevents unwanted animals from being euthanized, but it helps your pet avoid future behavioral and health problems.

Q4pUDkyHaa	Vinegar is classified as a VOC (Volatile organic chemical.) and long term exposure is not recommended, so rinsing is necessary.<br>  With 1 snake, this is probably OK.<br>  If you have more than 1 reptile in your place, I'd recommend a more robust, broad spectrum cleaning agent.<br>  I'd get a bottle of scrubbing bubbles, and use it to clean.<br>  Scrubbing bubbles is based on quaternary ammonium chemistry, and is harmless, but even so, I'd do a quick rinse.<br>  I'd also use a disinfectant after it's clean. <br>  Nolvasan is very good. It's what they use at vet's offices as a surgical scrub. Nolvasan S is what I use.  It's very mild, and won't irritate your skin or lungs.<br>  I just use scrubbing bubbles, do a quick rinse with water, then leave a bit of water in his enclosure. Squirt a bit of nolvasan into the puddle, then wipe it down with a clean rag, and let it dry. (Don't dry it with the rag, wipe it around with the rag, and let it dry on.)<br>  Rinsing is not necessary.<br>  If you have 1 snake, this would be overkill, but if you have lots of reptiles, it's a wise precaution to prevent illness from spreading to your entire collection.<br>  a $20 dollar bottle of Nolvasan will last a long time, and if you think it's too expensive, compare it with a visit to the vet's office.

ld2vmypNaa	GO with Elizabeth!!!  Aquatic are to expensive..<br>  <br>  Austinsturtlepage.com..great pic's of all turtles and info and care for all of  them.<br>  <br>   I have been blessed with two 37 yr old girl sliders and 3 adopted males<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  advice for aquatic..<br>  <br>  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.And require alot of $$$ and a BIG tank!<br>  <br>  Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle.. <br>  ***You need a heater...set at 80 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish (or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies) at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.<br>  **** If these are hatchlings a 1” and a tad over they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish can’t out run the baby turtle.<br>  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes. <br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples.<br>  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. And in the winter their appetites slow down some.<br>  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!!<br>  <br>  Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow. <br>  So they need a turtle basking dock. <br>  Gravel larger than they can swallow, allot larger.<br>  Their water needs to be clean otherwise they get sick easily from dirty water cause they poop allot. <br>  You need a GREAT filter system depending on the tank in a 60 gallon my girls were in one, I used two double sided marine or penguin filters…It really helped keep it cleaner! <br>  <br>  They will bite very very hard. Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle.. ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10“ in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ years plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You can’t start sexing till about 3” across. Real mating happens in May through June and hatchlings within 90 days. Eggs are laid in soil. If laid in water they will die. Do not cut the males nails!!<br>  They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes, foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans.<br>  <br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. <br>  Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .Swollen eyes due to lack of vitamin A fruits and veggies.<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin.<br>  <br>  Contact rescues sites…and vets<br>  Red-Eared Slider: <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a>|`|XmHEYD9Waa	There are tons of websites out there on turtle care and your pet store should have the information specific to the specific type of turtle you're looking for.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, aquatic turtles require tank with ten gallons of water per inch of turtle.  So if it's 5 inches, you'd need a 50 gallon tank.  The tank needs a filter, basking dock, and a UVA/UVB combination bulb to stimulate proper digestion, growth and immunity in the turtle.  Their diet consists of fruits, veggies, some lean meats or insects.  You can also use a pellet diet with fresh food substitutes.<br>  <br>  For desert/land tortoises, they also need an enclosed space large enough to accommodate their size with a fresh water bowl, food, light/heat source and daily cleanings cleanings.  Tortoises usually generally eat fresh fruits and veggies supplemented with vitamin enriched pellets.  Depends on the species.<br>  <br>  Turtles are actually a lot of work...I have three aquatic turtles and my cat is actually a lot less work/money, but I love them anyway.|`|a8nVLFchaa	not hard but they are very expensive|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Get a tortoise, they're cheaper in the long run.<br>  Otherwise you're talking about a good 400 bucks to start with, if anything breaks down, like the pump or filter, then you have to buy a new one. And they could get a disease, Salmonella, respiratory infection etc, because of the water.<br>  Tortoises are more easy going and less hard work.<br>  In my opinion, they're the best first-tortoise/turtle pets.<br>  <br>  But otherwise, the answers below pretty much have it covered.<br>  <br>  When aquatic turtles are babies, they eat only live or dead foods. Crickets, flies, grasshoppers, earthworms (that you buy, not from your backyard..they could have pestisides that could infect your turtle), ghost shrimp, feeder goldfish, guppies, minnows, etc.<br>  When they're about a year or two you can start to feed them aquatic turtle pellets.<br>  <br>  Their water should be 70-80 degrees.<br>  Their UVB light needs to be placed above their basking area -not too close to where your turtle may burn itself. -The basking area needs to be about ten degrees warmer than the water.<br>  Aquatic turtles live to be about 50-75 years old.<br>  If you get two, beware of the back of their feet being bitten. Or if they get a cut from sharp rocks.<br>  They should have one or two layers of river rock. Not sand, sand turns to sludge and can possibly ruin your filter.<br>  I don't recommend plants because turtles are notorious for tearing them up and it's a waste of money.<br>  They need a good filter to keep the water clean. This is very important because turtles are messy, their half-eaten worm has body parts flown out of their mouth and into their tank, they feces and urinate in their water which has bacteria. Salmonella is suseptible mainly to aquatic turtles because of the bacteria-infested water. This is very important not to get. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling.<br>  <br>  If your turtle ever gets a cut or bitten on the back of the foot, take it out of the water until its foot is completely healed. This may take up to two to three weeks, maybe even a month or longer. Turtles can survive without water or food for at least a month, my vet said three but I haven't had to do that.<br>  If it's a soft shell however, you must keep it in water at all times, besides when it's basking of course, because of it's leather-like skin.<br>  <br>  Don't put your fingers in the glass and watch it chase your fingers. They think it's food and it might possibly end up in aggression and might try to bite you out of bad habit.<br>  <br>  I suggest a plecostomus, a small or medium sized one, simply because they can eat anything the turtle has on it's shell. Keeps your tank glass, and your turtle clean. It's a two in one package.<br>  <br>  Turtles are great, but a big responsibility. Remember that.<br>  And if you ever need a vet, this is a list of vets who treat turtles/reptiles in different states:<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st..." rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st...</a><br>  Also, this site is amazing when it comes to turtles.

CAuU6M0oaa	a) Wrong.<br>  <br>  I am partially copying and pasting from another answer I gave, so pardon it.<br>  <br>  1. It is misleading. Cures are often dismissed that could help humans because they don't work in other animals. Many things make it to the market that were proven "safe" in animals yet killed or sickened humans. Thalidomide is a good example of this. Tylenol, advil, aspirin, penicillin, and other medications all proved deadly and/or worthless in nonhuman animals but are used in human still today. Animals are not good predictors of human response to disease and/or treatment.<br>  <br>  2. It is cruel. If what scientists do to animals in most labs was done by someone outside of a lab, that person would go to jail for years. Animals are given surgeries, imprisoned, caused pain, and so forth. Most of the animals used (rats and mice) are not even covered by the already thin coverage of the animal welfare act. You can do anything to a rat or mouse regardless of how painful.<br>  <br>  3. It is unnecessary. There are plenty of alternatives that offer much more applicable results to humans. These include but are not limited to in vitro research, mathematical models, epidemiology, clinical studies, and prevention research and promotion.|`|aIakDSstaa	B)<br>  <br>  Okay for medicine but not for cosmetics, If it wasn't beneficial they wouldn't do it. I love animals but think humans are more important. xx|`|TSc8OE4vaa	C.  You may think it's different, but it's not.  The treatment for diabetes was discovered by testing on dogs.  Yes, hundreds of animals died to find this treatment, but millions of humans (including my brother) are alive today.  Many other diseases have been cured by animal testing.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	(C).. Most testing is done on animals with similar D.N.A to us. Most animals that are tested on are bred in vast majority to test on.<br>  <br>  Think if some one you knew or your self had something wrong with you but it could be cured and it had been tested on animals would you refuse treatment?|`|HltUWMgOaa	I think it's wrong but short of using people I can't see any credible alternative.|`|FJZIvANFaa	George C, is so mean animals r so cute.<br>  i pick a) wrong|`|jnAAKCjHaa	A.  Wrong.  Always.<br>  <br>  You're right, animals are so different that just because something doesn't affect them, does not mean they won't affect humans.  Therefore, it makes testing on animals a waste of life, time, energy, MONEY, and it's just plain cruel.<br>  Also, animals can't talk.  Are they going to tell you if they lost their vision for a few hours, or went numb?  About the only outcome of animal testing that is measurable is excretory or urinary changes.<br>  Now, when it comes to medicine, it's illegal to take anything that hasn't been tested on animals.  But why not test on people?  That's a lot more accurate and the people can verbalize what's going on.  <br>  If humans want to consider themselves superior to animals, we should treat them with kindness, not evil.  Would you want someone poking and prodding at you? <br>  I'd rather use convicted rapists and murderers as test animals over innocent creatures.|`|AA11710118	Most, if not all new potential medicines undergo animal trials.  In these trials, many formulations are found to be highly toxic or deadly.  Would you rather these have been tested on human subjects first before learning about any potential toxicity.  Billion dollar awards are handed out in frivoloust lawsuits when actual known side effects occur at slightly above the expected rates...can you imagine the lawsuit exposure the pharmaceutical companies would face if they were force to do their initial trials on people!?  <br>  <br>  If find it odd that just about everyone has no problems killing a mouse or a rat that's invaded their home but so many of these same people cringe at the thought of rats and mice specifically bred for medical testing being killed so that they can live a longer and healthier life.|`|0QIDzCL9aa	a) wrong <br>  <br>  its cruel have you seen pictures of animals being tested on?  its disgusting the animals are terrified. guinea pigs are ties down onto tables, monkeys chained up, cats and dogs in tiny cages to scared to do anything. <br>  and anyway why test on animals there is a big difference between animals and humans.  they test on guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs.  something may affect us and not the animals or the other way around|`|BWMml8zAaa	wrong !<br>  wrong<br>  Double you, are, oh enn gee WRONG.<br>  BEACAUSE: ANIMALS have feelings too. they feel pain, they feel suffering they feel sadness. Just because they are not two legged doesnt mean they are not important. They should test medicines etc on murderers and kidnappers. there are plenty in prisons for them to test on. why on innocent cute animals?<br>  anyone who chooses c) is messed up. they shud be tested on if they choose C|`|6G47mC9Taa	IT is VERY WRONG animals are like us human beingas they have feelings too i honestly hate these types of ppl and when you see adverts on tv i feel like smashing it <br>  i agreee with you xx|`|kKd8ZQgBaa	depends if it's to test makeup, purfume, fags etc on then deffently no! but if it helps solving cancer etc then yes so (b) BTW GOERGE C IS A PEICE OF CRAP ON MY SHOE that needs top get a life u sik f*ck|`|hZcqEmbAaa	Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!!!|`|se27sAUwaa	I agree with you 100%. I know we wouldn't have a lot of the things we do today if it wasn't for "animal testing products", but honestly.. how many different shampoos, lipsticks, flavored drinks, stretchy pants, etc. do we need?? (Ok mental picture of animals testing stretchy pants is kind of funny, lol.)  It's really not worth it. What I would like to know is how these scientists, doctors, testers can continue with what they're doing when they see negative results?? Like they see Mimi the testing Chimp very sick or dying and they're like "Ok Mimi just drink this now, ok Mimi take this shot." Are you freakin' kidding me?? How could you do that?? Sorry... I got a little excited. So yeah.|`|C1XKd1q9aa	c) Right, otherwise people would die.<br>  <br>  If you disagree with it you can be first in line to the testings if it's abolished.|`|Mcj5WDfZaa	How would any of you like to be stuck in a small cage and stuck needles in you...i bet you wouldn't so why should we treat them any differently.|`|pMk19kkaaa	a) wrong.<br>  because they are different to what we are.<br>  also they would react differently to what we do.<br>  so wrong!

9c244bfee8268997c7b51bbd821a11f2aa	I also would not recommend it.  Ponds change temperature more rapidly than bigger bodies of water where these fish normally are, the fluctuations may be too much for them. But, depends on where you live!|`|e4VLcnTnaa	well i tried this sort of thing,  i set up my pond and bought some feeder fish to keep the mosquito larvae out and the darn toads ate my feeder fish ! so unless you can protect your fish from other critters and the weather i wouldn't try it!               `|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Some people definitely do this.  But you'd have to watch your temp fluctuations closely.  A random cold front could move in and kill them.<br>  I know it's done in some oriental countries with guppy ponds.  And in florida some people have done it with guppy as well and pleco in many different places.<br>  It just depends on your are and the temps.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	depends on were you live, what kind of fish, And do you care if they get eaten by animals. I would not do it they run the risk of getting eaten or catching something.  Most tropical fish will not live throw extreme temp changes. <br>  <br>  But it depends on were you live.
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It sounds like a behavioral issue.  Try using a Feliway diffuser in the house to help calm the anxiety.  Anti-anxiety drugs are also available at the vet.  I would first have him examined to rule out any health issues and then start working on the anxiety.|`|AA11364723	Since he was a bit on the grumpy side as a kitten, it may be (partially) due to his personality.  Some cats are lovers and some are fighters.  However, if he'd been neutered at a younger age, I think it would have calmed him down some, but probably not completely.  <br>  <br>  I have two male cats and both were neutered young.  However, they do tend to fight with one another on occasion and I think that's just the male side of their personalities - each one wanting to be the dominant cat of the household.|`|cqW523iCaa	cats don't do territorial thing in my knowledge i think only dogs and other mamals do this except cats.. i never seen cats defending their territory or hide out... why don't you see this and get more about your pets...|`|99teIRU7aa	It sounds like a typical cat promblem. Try using a diffuser in the house to help calm the anxiety. Nuetureing your cat will calm him too, he wont spray or go into heat. If you have other cats in your house even same gender get the cat nuetured, they become territorial and aggresive and can hurt fellow cats and humans while on a rampage. Also if your cat gets more tempuurrmental when your home or when your out, becuse if he gose crazy when your not home than he could have seperation anxiety.Best of luck with your little kitty, if you just follow vet instuctions everything will turn out just fine.|`|AA11170074	At 8 to 10 months of age, domestic cats have completed most of their physical development. The breaking up of litters and the growing aggressiveness of what was once play weaken the ties that bind kitten siblings together. By the time they're about 18 months old, they are drifting into adolescence. <br>  <br>  The testes of males may become visible as early as 4 weeks of age. In domestic cats, males reach full sexual maturity, if they remain unaltered, between 9 and 12 months of age. <br>  <br>  Basically if you want to avoid the aggressive behavior, spraying, etc. you should have your pet neutered as soon as your vet says he/she is old enough.|`|S4cIoYo6aa	My cat was found as a stray, so they told me at the shelter he was about 1 year old when he was found and "fixed".<br>  He used to be all over the place, mean, didn't like people...

09e41Hdwaa	I would at least report them to the Better Business Bureau.  What kind of tiel is it?  Does it still have pearly feathers?<br>  <br>  It needs to learn to eat food other than millet.  Take the millet away and give it seed and pellets during the day.  Give it millet in the morning and at night for about 20 minutes to ensure it won't starve to death.  Make sure to get it on pellets too, and don't put it on a seed mix that has sunflower seeds.<br>  <br>  Keep giving it fruits and veggies, even if it ignores them.  It will probably come around eventually.  My tiel's favorites are green beans, broccoli, and lettuce.  Sometimes it helps to eat some in front of them to show them how yummy it is.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-I would take it back NOW and go get one from a BIRD store!!!  They will have hand reared ones and you will see a huge difference in friendliness and quality!  Take any new bird to an avian vet for the initial check-up and to set up a relationship with the vet!  Try to find one that has been fed pellets, instead of seeds, and millet only on occasion!|`|m1ypmbNKaa	If it was my bird and that happened.I wouldnt return it right the next minute i would wait and see new results.You should stop feeding it millets and start feeding it something else.If it doesnt want to eat something else take the millets out.Unfortunately the bird will get hungry and eat whatever it has then keep doing it over and over.Then the bird will get used to the food its eating.If you see no such result then i would return it to the pet store.You should be guaranteed when buying that bird so i would return the bird if there is no result for 24-30 Hours.
v6Xmzno7aa	I know what you mean about watching your money, but I think you've answered your own question also.  You say you took your cat there and he was fine.  You also say it seems like a butcher shop and a revolving door situation.  On the other hand you feel confident with your Vet.  Is it  worth saving the $116.00?  I guess only you can answer that.  <br>  My answer would be a no brainer.  I stick to what I know I would do for my family member and my dog is a member of the family.  So though it's more it also is a one shot situation and if something happened to him (he's so tiny) at the lower priced place you'd never forgive yourself.  If something happened at your Vet, you would at least know that YOU did the best you could for him.<br>  Also, why would they remove his baby teeth at 4 1/2 months?  Unless they are infected they come out on their own.  Make sure your Vets clear about the reason.  It wouldn't be the first time they wanted to boost the price of the bill|`|xvTPUidNaa	The best place would be your regular vet. You know that vet and expect them to do a good job. And for the record $190 is CHEAP for spaying or neutering. I had to pay 300 dollars! If you find a vet online it sometimes isn't safe and clean. The better choice is the regular vet.|`|yf0tevyfaa	I would do the cheaper one. Lots of vets overcharge on stuff like that. Actually around my area, the average neuter is 35 to 50 bucks. Anything more than that and I would not go.|`|AA10500537	i;d try and find people who have used both vets and pick the best one .<br>  a few dollars doesnt mean anything  when it comes to the welfare of your pet.|`|QelCAFILaa	Do you have a PetSmart near you?  They offer a program that offers low cost neutering, shots and deworming for only $60.  It includes pain meds and whatnot for the surgery too.<br>  <br>  I just took my pup in about a week ago and he's perfectly healthy.  They have a certain shelter or vet you'll have to take him to.  I encourage you to check it out because it's very inexpensive and very effective too.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped ya!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  The place I took mine did the blood work for 25 extra|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I have had my dogs done at both places & was equally pleased with both. I would have no problem taking my dog to the low cost esp. if I had used it before with good results.  Put the money you would had used aside for a rainy day/vet bill in the future. Just be sure they will remove any baby teeth if needed & if needed have his nails cut down short while he is under so you can keep them short for now on.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	If finances are not tight and you think that the low cost place "seems like a butcher shop," then by all means go to your regular vet.  Does the low cost spay include pre-operative bloodwork?  Pain medication before and after the surgery?  Monitoring such as an ekg during surgery?  An IV catheter and fluids during surgery?  If he does have retained baby teeth that need to come out will they do that at the same time as the neuter and how much will it cost?  Obviously $74 is less expensive than $190...but if all they're doing is knocking your dog out and removing his testicles for that price than the more expensive surgery is probably the better deal.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I would go to my vet. He knows my dog. The low cost is like assembly line surgery. If you have no other option, I guess it would be better than nothing. If you need teeth extracted, your vet would do this during the surgery while your dog is out. If you need an extraction the dog is going to have to be put out for that anyway, so you can save on just one surgery by having your vet do it.The vet spayed my dog and removed 2 baby teeth.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	My puppy isn't old enough to be neutered yet, but I am going to a low-cost clinic to get it done...it's $40 there. I've adopted cats from that shelter before, and it requires all animals be fixed before adoption, I've never had any problems nor do I know anyone who's had problems with their animals being fixed there. So, I trust em.<br>  <br>  If you don't trust the low-cost clinic and you've got the cash, then stick with your regular vet if it makes you feel better.|`|AA11244754	usually most A.S.P.C.A.s have low cost spay neuter clinics just wait on getting him neutered (which you are very smart for wanting to do) until you see something something for a low cost clinic or look online for one near you and call them and see what their prices are and when and if they are going to have one in the near future.<br>  <br>  If I hadn't already gotten a dog that was neutered, I would go that route.|`|Bw18seFqaa	If your chi needs to have retained puppy teeth pulled..  it may actually be cheaper to just go to you regular vet in the long run..  you only have to pay for the anasthesia ONCE then, and your dog only has to go thru the risk of anashesia ONCE...  it can all be done at once.
z4pB3oVWaa	you could keep one in a tank of corals,as they won't be eaten.angler fish can swallow fish the same size as themselves.along with shrimp and crabs make sure tank mates can't be eaten.as the" frogfish "gets bigger,the risk increases.the anemone,might sting the angler,and mandarin,causing deaths.best kept in a species tank.
w1lh1INHaa	If your vet feels it is respiratory related, such as asthma or an infection, he probably won't do x-rays, as x-rays generally require anesthesia or some kind of knock-out, and the vet would probably be reluctant to anesthetize with breathing difficulties.<br>  <br>  A vet can determine a number of respiratory problems just by examining the animal and by closely listening to lung function.  A respiratory infection aside, if the lungs and airways seem to be functioning properly, then the vet will want to do some more serious digging.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	A physical exam and a complete history will determine if they take an x-ray (sedation is not always necessary - it depends on the attitude of the cat).  They can see changes in the lungs & bronchi.  Also, heartworm disease in cats show up more as lung/breathing problems than they do in dogs.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Yes, they look for certain changes in the bronchial tubes - like inflammation.  It will be there even if he's not currently coughing.  Ideally your cat will cough right in front of the vet :o/
SLSX6QQsaa	Yes, it's normal to feel a cats spine.  My cats are both healthy (9 & 12 lbs) and I can feel their spines even though they are not skinny.  Also, I had a cat that lived to be 27.  He was always about 7 lbs. but got down to 4 1/2 in his old age.  He was a bag of bones at the time he died, age 27.  Just like old people, they get frail and skinny a lot of the time.  Age 11 is not old though, he's just at the top of the hill, not even over the hill yet :)  You can also find supplements for your cat now that hes getting older, glucosamine and chondroitin will be good for his joints and hips which is a common issue with old cats.  You could get some treats for him to keep him healthy and fight off arthritis that is bound to set in sometime in the future (more likely around age 15-18).|`|Gln3WGojaa	It's normal with the age of your cat<br>  I had a cat for 16 years and the older she became the more prominant her spine was<br>  no need for alarm|`|1SxFP1Chaa	As cats age they tend to slim down. Mine is 13 and the same as yours. He seems so fragile to me now.|`|E3yOmel9aa	He is all right, just aged.
ur5wDhkMaa	Mid May would be fine, it's not so much the water temp, (bigger ponds heat and cool more slowly, positioning to the amount of daily sunlight is another factor).<br>  <br>  The fish need to be building up their body fat for the winter, so you try to time their rehoming to the insects being active. Pond food is their staple diet, but meat on the wing is what builds them up.|`|V2kqgqzpaa	It should be fine but the fish may not become adapted to the change as they are used to the warmth. If you've had no problems with them in a tank then why change their environment now. Hope i've helped.|`|ah1axsV6aa	Ur fish have days/hours to live.<br>  Sorry.|`|Drnpe4T5aa	If you are going to make a change to their environment, try to do so as slowly as possible.<br>  Definitely wait until the weather warms up. <br>  Then, to avoid a shock to their systems when changing from your aquarium water to "outside" water, slowly add a bit of the outside water each day (say, about 10% of the water at a time) while removing the same amount of the aquarium water.  When you have done this enough times that the water in the aquarium is now roughly half aquarium water and half "outside" water, you can put them in a baggie filled with water and float them in the baggie for an hour or so before opening the bag to allow them to swim out (to help the water temp even out).<br>  Good luck to you and your fish!<br>  FYI - I have friends who have a pond and they have to bring their fish in each winter and keep them in an aquarium so they don't freeze and die.  Hopefully your new locations have made plans to do similar?<br>  Keep in mind that fish in an aquarium will only grow as big as their environment allows.  So if you are putting them in a pond, they will eventually grow too big for an aquarium.  <br>  You might consider just buying a bigger aquarium yourself.  Just a thought...
wqL84O8Naa	got a dishwasher?|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	Ewwww, 5,000,000,000...lol that is gross. You need to call your vet and talk to them about this gross habit and if you need to bring her in then I would. you should NEVER bath a pregnant cat. Take her to the groomers or maybe the Vet can do it for you as well. Cats are very clean, that's why I love cats. Good Luck with your MaMa Cat and I will pray she will have healthy baby kittens. I'm sure if you ever experience a cat giving birth but its a beautiful miracle. I actually helped my cat deliver 6 kittens. It was a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnng night...lol :o)|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	There is something very wrong with your cat if she is rolling in her own waste. You need a Vet, then a groomer.|`|BeNazR8Jaa	i almost never give my cat a bath cuz cats cleanse themselves you know, they lick themselves clean. We do give baths occasionally...fill the bathtub with very warm water so they don't freak out...just slowly let her in, feet in first. (temperature is very important, make sure it's not too hot nor lukewarm cuz lukewarm feels too cold for a bath) Place your hand over her paws or let her hold unto something like your arm while you wash her.  hmm...but i dunno about giving pregnant cat a bath.|`|KmC0K59taa	First get everything ready and by the tub - shampoo, towels, cup.  Let the tub fill up and shut it off.  Round up your cat and bring her to the bathroom. Pet her and talk to her calmly.  Shut the bathroom door.  Slowly place her in the water and keep one hand on her at all times.  I will sometimes keep one hand around the front paws and kind of have her stand up.  That way she can't scratch or really move at all.  Squirt on shampoo with your free hand and rub in.  Grab the cup and rinse her off.  Place her on the towel and dry her off.<br>  <br>  I've found the first minute or two can be bad, but once you start pouring the water on, the cat will calm down.  Some cats will just freeze after you start pouring the water on them.  I've given an outdoor cat a bath this way and didn't get one scratch.<br>  <br>  The running water will scare him, so it's important to have the tub filled up before hand.  Good luck.|`|wnnudNp5aa	There is something very, very wrong with a cat that is rolling in it's own waste! They are fastidious about being clean, obsessive/compulsive, even. If you are cleaning her box daily, there shouldn't be that much excrement in it, either. You should take her to the vet to find out what is wrong with her. <br>  For ordinary freshening up, I would suggest pet-wipes, they will freshen up a pet without water. For this kind of mess, I don't think that will do the trick. First, ask your vet if it's okay. Then, get some cat and kitten shampoo (it's like baby shampoo, but safe for cats). The way I bathe my cat (very rarely), is to put him in the sink (you might want to use the tub, though), and get a real good grip on the scruff of his neck. Never pick a cat up this way, but if you get a good hold, they will stay still. Then you can bathe her without a struggle. Talk soothingly to her the whole time, so she'll know you aren't trying to kill her, lol. If you have someone to help you, you can get it over with a lot faster. Make sure not to get water in her ears. Put a piece of cotton into each ear, if you have to. Make sure you use warm water and get all the shampoo rinsed out of the coat. Then dry her off with a big, fluffy towel or two, and then let her go. She should finish the job, running through the house before settling down to lick her coat back into shape. When she's all done, give her her favorite treat for being such a good girl.<br>   I wouldn't take her to a groomer. They could do it, but they often tranquilize cats to groom them, not good for or her kittens.<br>  To prevent further soiling, try to clean her box as often as possible every day, until you get to the root of this problem. She can't roll in her waste if there isn't any!<br>  Really, she needs to get to a vet, though. This is as far from normal as it gets! I'd really like to hear what the problem is when you find out. I've never heard of this before.<br>  BTW, unless you are a pro breeder, while you are at the vet's, make an appt. to get her spayed when her kittens are weaned. There are already too many unwanted kittens in the world, we don't need more. Thanks!|`|BnOrf9nGaa	if she is pregnant i would just bring her to a groomer.  if she wasn't preggo i would just hold her down in the tub or sink and maker her deal with it.  That's what I do with my cats.  But don't take the chance of hurting the babies.. just bring her to a professional.  Try cleaning the litter box out twice a day.  I know it sucks, but so does petting a cat that's covered in **** now isn't it.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Aside from a Vet bath or pet groomer - The safest way is to buy some unscented baby wipes (or you can buy cat cloths for dry bathing)  and give her a nice rub-down with them.  Make it into a massage and happy time and not a 'bath'.

62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	I have a formerly 28 pounder that got fatty liver disease and megacolon. The vet at the hospital I DON'T go to anymore caged him and had him on IV etc. to try to "get him better." When I went and saw him, I told them to give him back to me. They told me if I took him home he'd die. That was 8 years ago.<br>  <br>  Over the years he has lost almost 10 pounds. He is on .8 mg of cisapride twice daily and 3 ml. of lactulose/enulose to keep his bowls moving. He also gets  3ml of mineral oil every night before bed. He eats a can of Fancy Feast medleys (the Florentine variety for the greens) in the morning and 1/2 can of Friskies or Nine LIves at supper. We tried other "prescription" diets to no avail. We keep a Fleet enema at the house and if we notice he hasn't pooped in awhile we "grease him up" to get things moving again. He hardly EVER needs this. Only once in the last 5 years has he needed a surgical removal of the feces. Mostly he is doing VERY well and has defied all the odds. Massage of the bowel also works if things seem to be getting backed up. <br>  <br>  Watch your cat closely. Learn his behavior and mannerisms and respond very quickly. This will be his best medicine.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	science deit is best but you should talk to a vet|`|AA11457471	Mega colon is a tough one to deal with. I give you lots of credit for hanging in there.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, surgery should be an absolute last resort. Far too often they develop adhesions post surgery.<br>  <br>  I fed my MC kitty a combo of mostly canned & a little dry. Back then there weren't as many choices of better foods. I'd look for one high in meat content & without corn, wheat or soy & BHA & BHT free.<br>  The foods that come with high fiber tend to not have much flavor.<br>  I added fiber by adding canned pumpkin (not pie mix) & Benefiber to his canned food. He really liked the pumpkin & it's natural & it's cheap.<br>  I also try to always have a container of live cat (wheat) grass available for all my guys as it really aids in digestion. I get it at the produce store but I think most health food stores carry it as well.<br>  <br>  Don't leave food out for your cat to graze on. It's really important not to let him get fat! Feed him two scheduled meals (three if he's very young) daily.<br>  <br>  Encourage your cat to consume liquids beyond the normal water intake. Try some low sodium/ low fat chicken broth or things like that.<br>  <br>  I was eventually able to get him off the meds.<br>  <br>  Hopefully things will go well for you both. Feel free to contact me if I can be of more help.<br>  Best wishes!|`|AA11945637	ask the vets, am sorry about the cat|`|oDVx7nSxaa	I've had a cat with megacolon, and the only thing I can say is that I regret I did not have the operation done sooner.  I would check with a board certified surgeon and what he/she has to say about your cat being a good candidate or not for the surgery, and what the expected outcome is.  While it's not a terribly complicated surgery, there is high risk of infection due to the fact that the colon is an infectious organ.  In rescue we've seen a number of cats with this problem.  Of the ones who had the surgery all are doing well (one has the occasional loose poop that doesn't always make it into the litter box).  One died from complications to the surgery - terrible infection that wasn't noticed in time.  Interestingly enough, this was the only surgery done by a "regular" vet and not a board certified surgeon.  Do consider the surgery - but as I said, seek out the opinion of a specialist who has experience with it.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, ditch the dry RX diets in favor of an all-canned one.  The extra moisture in the canned food is terribly important, the dry food if you think about it really goes against the whole idea of keeping the system "well lubricated".   If he's on lactulose and Propulsid (cisipride) those are really the two best medications.  The lactulose dosage can be increased if it doesn't seem to be doing the trick. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

SLSX6QQsaa	When cats get fixed they often go through a phase where they are just not feeling like themselves, and in some pain.  My cat also did the same thing.  He's quite the mean cat, but after getting neutered he was purring like crazy and even drooling when I held him. He was also giving me sad faces.  I felt horrible.  I could tell he wasn't feeling good.  Did the vet give you any pain meds for him?  If they kept him for a day they might not have because they would give him meds at the vet for pain.  You could ask the vet about some pain meds for him, just for a couple more days.  It might help.  He will feel better very soon.  I would give him maybe a couple of weeks and he will be back to his normal self. He could also be a little traumatized with all of the vet smells and everything.  My male cat wouldn't go near my other cat for 2 WEEKS after she was spayed because she smelled like the vet.  Also my female cat, her personality HAS changed since being spayed.  She was 4 when I finally had it done (got her at 3 years old, unspayed, and shes indoor only so no babies) but she was always really lazy, never played, whined and meowed all the time.  After getting spayed its like her real personality came out and she plays all the time.  Shes so much happier and she doesn't meow so much, just enough to let me know what she wants.  I would not worry, your cat is going to be back to his normal self soon.  Also just so you know, cats don't think about being a daddy, its only nature to impregnate as many female cats as possible, theres no emotional connection. lol.  Good luck.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	How long ago did you get him neutered?  Cats will act a bit strangely for the first week or so, but they're usually fine after that - dont worry!  He's not mad at you - you did the right thing by him.|`|E3yOmel9aa	My cat acted a little funny for a few days too. He would not eat much either. The vet assured me he was fine and he did perk right back up after about a week.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	No, he's not being resentful or missing of his "family jewels".  Cats don't think about or want to raise a family - they have the instinct to mate, and that is where the male's interest ends (hmmm - sounds like some human males, too, LOL!).  While most male cats have recovered in a day or two, depending on the anesthetic your vet used, it can take a bit of time for it to work out of his system.  Just keep an eye on his surgery site.  It heals quickly and without a problem in probably 99% of cats, but there is always that unusual one where there can be an infection or complicated.  And he may be a bit sore in his back end.  If he's not back to himself in another day or two, or if you see signs of redness or infection from the surgery area, then call the vet.  I'm betting that he'll be just fine though.|`|BCRC9TLfaa	I think you should give him more time to adjust, it was an operation, afterall.<br>  <br>  Maybe check with you're vet, as cats tend to get 'down' when they are ill or in pain and try to conceal their feelings.<br>  <br>  It would probably also put you're mind at ease to speak to the vet and ask any more questions you may have..|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Some animals go through this and it is temporary.

I'd keep doing what you're doing and make sure she's a comfortable as possible, and if you have to move her before she's had them, get it over with as quickly as possible and make sure she's got a nice spot set up at the new house. <br>  <br>  It may be that she knows she's going to be leaving too and is trying to hold off until then. Cats and animals in general are pretty smart so I wouldn't put it past her. Just keep a close eye on her and I'm sure she'll be fine!
AA11992723	honestly I would not go away to college because i know no one else would give my dogs the leadership and exercise they need every day. but hey this is life.....whoever is going to be left in charge of your dogs while you're away should enroll in some obedience classes before you go (or a sport like agility, flyball or rally-o). this will help transition the dogs from you to your family, your dogs will need that chance to bond with someone else in order for them to feel they are safe without you and someone else is the leader.<br>  <br>  As for you, you can make a blog or webpage about them perhaps..have your family update it for you so you can check from school.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	There are 17 pet friendly colleges and universities.

Drnpe4T5aa	Try the "Busy Buddy" -  It is similar to the Kong toys, with a compartment to put food or treats into.  But the big difference is that it is more of a challenge to get the food and treats out - making it last longer.  It holds about 2 cups.  Our's is purple - haven't seen it in any other colors.<br>  It is a sealed plastic container with holes, so the treats can be seen and smelled, with a rubber piece around the opening and a rubber plunger-like thing that goes into it but can't be *completely* pulled out.  The dog has to push the plunger in, then pull it back out - as far as it will go - to get the goodies.  <br>  Our Coonhound (not quite as bright as a lab - but also prone to anxiety when we left) took a couple tries to figure it out, but totally loves it.  It stimulates his mind, gets him playing and keeps him busy.  Since it is more of a challenge, it lasts longer than most food/treat-stuffed toys.  We give him his meal in this and it lasts an hour instead of 10 seconds.  <br>  The nice thing is that you are not loading your pooch up on all kinds of high-fat treats, which can lead to obesity.  You just put regular dog food in it.  And it was not expensive at all.  <br>  And, FYI - Small kibble works best.  ;)<br>  Good luck!<br>  For the article that Ardy is talking about, follow the link below to snopes.  The product was a "four paws" product, not a Kong product.|`|rawz0RJuaa	my dog just licks like crazy too. he has never chewed at all and with the licking, he is done with it in a matter of minutes. SO what i started doing was stuffing it with peanut butter, the kong stuffing (which i use on rare occasions because it is kinda unhealthy) or i have also used a combo of peanut butter with little pieces of cheese mixed in. then stuff it full and pop it in the freezer until its hard. since it is frozen, it will take much longer. this will occupy my dog about 2 hours|`|OxFsslN8aa	I make my own peanut butter by pureeing unsalted roasted peanuts & peanut oil until it is the consistency I like.  This stuff can last in the fridge for up to 6 months & there is no preservatives in it.  I also fill it with canned dog food & freeze it.  I have small dogs and they lick the thing forever.  My golden retriever would only lick the Kongs too - never chewed on them.|`|UONwTWIQaa	have you tried freezing the peanut butter in the kong? i stuff the kong with peanut butter and dry dog food  or a large treat, then freeae it solid.. that keeps her busy forever!|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	I used peanut butter,  with a dab of cream cheese and a treat.  You can try bread with a treat in the middle. Just don't give too much dairy to your dog, he can get sick.  My dog doesn't chew the kong he is more interested on what is inside.  That being said, giving your dog exercises and with chew toys can help his energy level. So you need to do more then give him a chew toy. <br>  <br>  Also before you leave a good thing to try is taking him out for a walk before you leave,  you can kennel him if he is destructive. You have a high energy dog.. You can buy more then one Kong.. It works best to teach the dog to find it and actually hide the Kong's before you leave the house.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	I've had two kongs for my two dogs for 5 years - the SAME kongs.  Those things are indestructible!!! <br>  <br>  We either rub some peanut butter up inside it so they really have to work at getting it out, or put treats that you really have to shove inside (you'll have to search around for the right size treat, depending on the Kong).  If all else fails, shove some Milkbones in there.  The bone shape keeps it from falling right back out and you can put like 3 or 4 in at a time.<br>  <br>  I also buy a bag of Hills T/D every now and again ( it's a tartar control diet available through vets but a prescription is not needed) that I use as treats for my dogs.  The kibble is HUGE and shoves right up in that Kong!  And once it's out, they get a good, teeth cleaning treat!<br>  <br>  We have the medium size kongs, I have a shepherd mix and a beagle mix (also full of anxiety).<br>  <br>  Oh, and just licking the Kong is fine, the point is to keep him busy so he's not focusing on you not being there.  And don't just give him the Kong when you're leaving because he'll start associating that with your absence.|`|KuUx34hCaa	BE WARE THE TOYS THAT HAVE HOLES IN THEM there was an article via e-mail with picture showing dog with thier tongue stuck in it & cause serious injures & some of these dogs will never be the same with many surgery!

S1LxX6CNaa	Lifespan<br>  The lifespan of snails varies from species to species. In the wild, Achatinidae snails live around 5 to 7 years and Helix snails live about 2 to 3 years. Aquatic Apple Snails live only a year or so. Most deaths are due to predators or parasites. In captivity, their lifespan is much longer, ranging from 10 to 15 years for most species. On occasions, snails have lived beyond this lifespan, up to 30 years.[10]|`|3iNKh4eRaa	1 yaer
KxjUim7yaa	I hate to suggest pee pads, but they may be the thing for you considering the weather and his size. You can crate train him. Take him from his crate and have him use the pee pad or newspaper in a cleanable area. Don't let him run all over the house or you are going to have problems. Go to his area to play with him. As puppies my dogs used paper right in front of the door they would be going out when they were potty trained. As the weather got better we went outside after leaving the crate and I took a few "wet" papers and put them on the grass. The sniffed and they went there. As they got older they went out  more and the paper spots decreased. Today they are completely trained. We had one accident in 4 1/2 years. Some people will object to my using the kitchen, but it's floor cleans easier than spots all over the house.|`|AA11244754	look up house breaking online and see if you can find any good links on how to do it, I wouldn't think that it would be that difficult.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Crate train.  Buy him a crate that is big enough to sleep in & so that when he is full grown he can still turn around in it. Get him a warm base & some blankets.Give him something of yours so he knows you are around. Cover the top with a blanket, puppies have a fear of things from above during the night.  When you go out put him in the crate so he is safe & you know he cannot damage anything.  Before you go out let him go outside for his business wait until he has done it & then put him in.  As soon as you come in put him outside for business & praise him when he does.  If he is a very tiny puppy he will have a tiny bladder & will need to go out every 2 or 3 hours until he is around 6 months old.  When you get to the stage where he is allowed out of the crate when you are out I would put some newspaper by the back door just in case he cannot wait.  Worked a treat for my adopted 9 month old Whippet puppy she is now 15 months old & only has the odd poo accident.  I have also got an 8 year old Whippet who has helped her a lot.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	dont use puppy pads because thats still in the house. keep your dog in a crate when your not at home and when your not able to watch him. make sure you take your puppy out to go potty every 2 hours and when they do potty in the house really get onto them and make them see that its bad then immediatley take them outside so they know thats where they go instead.when they potty outside give them a treat and really praise them for going potty outside. even though its cold you need to take him outside.. when you get a puppy there's sacrifices you have to make and going outside in cold weather late at night and early in the morning is part of it.|`|fce5d52d7a2eabde37a772a4248573d1aa	just keep take him outside every half hour and let him walk around for a few minutes and put a ton of newspaper on the floor just in case....when my dog was learning to go on the paper and outside....when she would go i would just start freaking out and be like good girl!!!!!! yay!! and id get her a treat..and i pretty much did the same when putting her outside but just remember to be calm about it because its going to take awhile and never get mad at the dog for anything...good luck to you and your dog!<br>  <br>  and please dont try and crate train him...because he either wont pee in there because he wants to sleep there or he wont sleep in there...or he'll step in it|`|AA10500537	get a crate and  keep it in it   and take it out every couple of hours and your problem will be solved|`|vouUQQzBaa	Crating.<br>  1.The crate should be big enough for the puppy to stand and turn around but NO bigger (otherwise the puppy will go to the furthest corner to take care of needs).<br>  2.After drinking or eating, always be ready to bring puppy where you want him to go for his needs (pick puppy up, don't expect the puppy to follow you with relieving himself first).<br>  3.Try to establish a routine. Dogs LOVE routines and will appreciate you following them<br>  4.Give puppy treat when he does right. Firmly reprimand him if he does wrong (do NOT hit)<br>  5.Keep in crate and take out every half hour or so (if possible). And slowly extend the time in crate so that puppy understands not to do it *inside*.<br>  <br>  Believe me, puppies are smart. If they see they're getting a reward (praise praise praise), they will get the hint ;)|`|xvTPUidNaa	When you bring him outside make sure that if he goes give him a treat right away. If you don't he won't understand that if he goes inside that its bad, and outside is good. Pee pads aren't a good thing to use. They make the puppy pee inside more. You should buy a crate and take him out every time he circles in the crate. hope this helps!|`|ltP1gO4taa	Edit: If you are unwilling to do what's necessary to train your dog, then I suggest you get used to living in a house full of pee and poop.  <br>  <br>  I love my dog more than anything, but I do understand that she's a dog and does not have human feelings.  Don't humanize your dog, it only hurts them.  <br>  <br>  If you get your dog on a regular feeding and potty schedule and keep him in an appropriately sized cage he will quit going in the house.  If the cage is big enough for two dogs or your dogs size to lay down then it is too big.  Put something inside the cage with the dog like an ice chest, or a box so that he just has room to turn around and lay down.  Once he gets trained he can have the extra space.   If he still pees and poops then sleeps in it, you may have a medical issue on your hands.<br>  <br>   My dog hardly ever gets locked in her cage anymore, but she did for a couple of weeks in the beginning.  I am not unsympathetic to your feelings about the cage.  That's why I use the term CAGE instead of CRATE.  I think it's a lot easier for irresponsible pet owners to CRATE their dog for 12 hours a day than it is to CAGE their dog for 12 hours a day.<br>  <br>  Also, notice I didn't say that the dog must be caged all of the time.  A leash can be used to accomplish the same goals while still allowing the dog to interact with the family.<br>  <br>  ====<br>  <br>  Get rid of the puppy pads.  Not only are they disgusting and unsanitary, they can be confusing to a dog.  They instill in the animal that it's OK to go in the house.<br>  <br>  You need to stay outside as long as it takes, so bundle up.  You also need to crate (cage) train him.<br>  <br>  If you prevent the dog from going in the house by keeping him in the cage or on a leash at all times until he's trained he will go when you take him outside.<br>  <br>  Get a cage. Make sure that it's just big enough for the puppy to turn around in and not big enough for him to eliminate on one side and sleep on the other. Most cages come with a divider, so you can buy one he can grown in to. Keep him in the cage any time you are unable to supervise him.<br>  <br>  A puppy can only "hold it" for about one hour per month of age.  So if your puppy is 3 months old he needs to go out every 3 hours.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is take your dog outside, on a leash, to the area where you want him to eliminate under the following circumstances:<br>  First thing in the morning.<br>  About 15 minutes after eating.<br>  About 15 minutes after drinking water.<br>  Immediately after a play session.<br>  Right before he goes into his crate.<br>  Every x number of hours. (1 hour for every month of age.)<br>  When he goes say a word, like 'Potty' and praise him when he's done.  After a few times he'll go on command.<br>  <br>  Remember, your puppy can only hold it for 1 hour per month of age. So if you have a 2 month old puppy, you are going to have to get up a couple of times during the middle of the night if you want to be successful.

Not sure why!<br>  <br>  Theres some more information here: <a href="http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/persian-cats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/persian-...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a discussion of the different types in relation to breed standards of various organizations: <a href="http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/traditional-doll-face-persian-cat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/traditio...</a><br>  <br>  Persians are high maintenance cats.  Be prepared for grooming every day! They also tend to some health problems. Going for one with less extreme face should help there, but you still need to be aware.  When you go to a breeder, make sure their cats are tested for PKD (<a href="http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/persian-cat-health-problems.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/persian-...</a>  You should also make sure you can see the kitten with it's mother.  Should you come across a 'kitten mill' type situation, don't buy a kitten to 'save' it.  You'll only be paying for it's parents to be kept in those conditions, and more to be bred.  Instead walk away and report to local RSPCA/SPCA/whatever.<br>  <br>  You might want to consider getting a rescue Persian...|`|4aAhEK9daa	If you don't like the breed standard flat face of a Persian then go adopt a shelter cat of no particular breed.  There are "doll face" Persians that don't have the flat face but reputable breeders don't breed them since it's not the breed standard.  And you REALLY don't want to buy cats - especially a Persian - from a breeder selling cats to make money - not for the love of and to better the breed.  <br>  <br>  PKD - Polycystic Kidney Disease is an early onset form of kidney disease that Persians are genetically predisposed for. Reputable breeders test to see if kittens carry this gene and if they do - they don't breed them. Bad breeders DON'T and then end up with litter upon litter of PKD positive kittens. A cat with PKD can end up in renal failure as four years old. <br>  <br>  Have you researched what it takes to own a Persian? Do you know their coats can't be brushed? They need to COMBED. Brushes pull out and break top coat hairs and do little to remove the dead hairs of the undercoat. A Persian's coat must be fully combed at least EVERY OTHER DAY ALL YEAR LONG to prevent matting. With their flat faces a simple cat cold can easily turn into a full blown URI. So special care needs to be given at the very sign of sniffles in a Persian. Persian cat eyes tend to tear and the cat can end up with badly tearstained fur. There are products to help deal with this but they're pricey. <br>  <br>  Not that ANY cat should eat cheap cat food but especially not a Persian. A poor diet will reflect in a dull, shedding, shabby coat. A Persian MUST be fed a quality meat-based diet with little to no grain. They also can have issues with picking up some shapes of food so you have to take that into account as well.<br>  <br>  Because of their high maintenance Persians are one of the breeds most often dumped at shelters. People buy them on a whim or because they think it'll impress others without a clue the care they require. So you don't end up one of these people please buy a book and do LOTS of research on them before getting one. And on that note, if you do have the time and finances to be able to care for one - adopt one from a shelter. I can almost guarantee there's at least one Persian at a shelter near you. And if you want to make sure the shelter Persian is PKD- it's a simple cheek swab DNA test that your vet can do for you.|`|YxQe7CCuaa	Try checking on the net: Doll face persian cats <br>  goodluck!|`|yxJKgf9Faa	you are looking to get a *traditional persian cat* i have a traditional persian cat and he is beautiful i prefer him to the squashed variety to give you an idea heres a picture of him....<br>  <br>  face..<a href="http://i631.photobucket.com/albums/uu33/miggy8730/kjlhbgvfcguipolkmnbhv.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i631.photobucket.com/albums/uu33/...</a><br>  <br>  body:<a href="http://i631.photobucket.com/albums/uu33/miggy8730/kjlhbgvfcguipolkmnbhv3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i631.photobucket.com/albums/uu33/...</a><br>  <br>  both his parents where ultra breed type but hes face isnt very squashed compared to his syblings.....i suppose i just have to wait for the facial change as he gets older i just call him *dollface* or *traditional* because thats the type that he most resembles <br>  x|`|MYNezY8Gaa	I have a blue point Hymalian Persian and he is the most beautiful boy ever :) well to me @ least...<br>  <a href="http://www.city-data.com/forum/members/adri0380-416992-albums-my-little-man-feurious-pic10206-how-cute-he.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.city-data.com/forum/members/a...</a><br>  <br>  he is a little older now, but these are the only pictures i can access @ the moment from work.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	The ones you do not like are the ones that are supposed to be like that as they are bred to the standard.<br>  <br>  The other ones are sometimes called "doll-face" but they are nothing more then people breeding cats outside the standard for money only.<br>  <br>  If you are gonna breed cats they should be bred to the written standard and to improve the breed - not breed cats that you like.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	i would say you like a persian mix.
FvAl3UgQaa	ded65 and caz223 are correct. It sounds like you have the ideal climate to allow a Mediterranean tortoise to thrive outdoors, which is ideally where they belong. <br>  <br>  What are your Winters like?<br>  <br>  Your mention of high humidity would lead me to advise you against a horsfieldii/Russian tortoise, as they don't do well in high humidity environments. Hermanns or T.(g) ibera would be a much better choice.<br>  <br>  As others have mentioned, though, do ensure adequate shade and drinking water is available at all times.|`|CdRlOsnyaa	Russian Tortoise - <br>  Temperature is critical for a healthy tortoise. The pen should have a cool end with the temps in the low 70's and a basking spot at 90-95°F. Night time temperature drops are needed. Mine do well with temps that drop down into the 60's at night. If they are kept too cool they can't digest their food. Too warm and they stop eating and aestivate (sort of like suspended animation). so you could get this tortoise make sure to provide shade and water though <br>  <br>  Greek tortoise - <br>  A temperature gradient of 75° - 85° F should be provided with a basking area of 95° F. Nighttime temperatures can be allowed to drop to 75° F.  you are also suitable to have this one ( same thign they need water and shade these tortoises also liek hiding spots)|`|2z69twcpaa	it sounds like you have the ideal temps to keep a tortoise outside in the natural sunlight and grazing, they need temps of 90-95* in the basking area and 70's for the cool end so the temps you get will be ideal as long as you provide a shelter where the tortoise can escape the hot sun and have a secure Predator proof enclosure, here is a couple of sites you can look at to check the conditions but the temps you are saying are good for a tortoise, <a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/</a>    <a href="http://www.tortoisetrust.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoisetrust.org/</a>  best of luck honey|`|l0ktQUnWaa	It should be alright. don't let the nighttime temperature drop much below 65-70.

IuYekkPVaa	Territory means everything to a cat because it's the source of the things (food, love & shelter) that they need to survive.  They will not abandon a good one on the basis of one fight.  <br>  <br>  I feed some stray cats and a few months ago two of them got into a nasty fight.  The cat that came off worst still kept coming every day to be fed, but he was a little wary of being around the other cat and kept his distance from him for a week or so.  <br>  <br>  Your neighbour's cat is probably hiding somewhere close by until the intruder disappears.  Keep looking for him, and ask any other neighbours to check sheds, garages or any other outside buildings in case he's hiding there.<br>  <br>  Hope you find him safe and well very soon.  Good luck.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	If her place is fenced in, her cat can still jump the fence.  All cats can. And even if this was an effective method of keeping the cat in a certain area, it didn't work this time so It guess it doesn't always work.  What you are attempting to do is interfere with nature, and it will not do any good.  Cats are territorial, yes.  But you are suggesting taking one of two outdoor cats to a shelter so the other will come back.  There's no way to read the minds of these cats.  They are both outdoor.  It might work, or the other cat might find a new territory instead.  Also if you do choose to take the Tom to the shelter could you please look for a no-kill animal rescue in your area?  Unfortunately you would only be sending the Tom away to be killed if you take him to most overcrowded shelters.|`|wAzNCS48aa	He may have lost the fight. In my opinion the best thing to do is tell your neighbor to call your local shelter and see if they can lay a "cat trap". This will trap the cat safely inside. Once his rival is gone then he may come back. Cats are very protective of their land but once they lose it to a bigger and stronger  cat then they tend to run off. He may try to come back and get his land back so just tell her to keep a look out for him other wise. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to her and her kitty. =)|`|E3yOmel9aa	The cat will come back. This happened with my brothers cat, he was gone for almost two weeks and came back one day like nothing ever happened. <br>  They do know where their homes are, domesticated cats do act differently in this way than wild cats and will not abandon their home because they lost a fight.
n4pNNcGfaa	If you're talking about a mix, you'll have pups of little or no value monetarily.  It may be difficult to find them all good homes.  If this breeding just occurred, it may not be too late for a miss-mate shot from the vet to abort the pregnancy.  It may not be too late for an emergency spay to halt the pregnancy and prevent future pregnancies.  Frankly, if you are not able to prevent accidental breedings this is what you should do.<br>  <br>  If it's too late and the pups are eventually born, all you can do is work hard to socialize them properly so they develop into mentally sound puppies.  It gives them their best possible chance of finding good homes.  As to whether any or all of them will make good pets, most of that depends on you and how well you raise them.
4cbf847c53fc6ad4213b46c089548375aa	Yes. Surely. Get them vaccinated properly.|`|DE2Q85v9aa	Can't say, but you need to be careful and please get her fixed.
SLSX6QQsaa	It sounds like the "other" owner doesn't care too much since they obviously let her free roam with cuts and scratches, as well as let her have babies.  I hate to say it, but this cat is destined to live a VERY short life and I would be surprised if shes around next year.  I would take her in, and don't let her outside anymore.  If they cared about their cat they wouldn't let her remain in this condition and keep sending her out.  They obviously don't want her to have a regular collar, like they are trying to show you or prove a point to you.  What other reason would they have to remove her collar?  And they are probably mad that you took off the flea collar.  Please don't let this cat become another statistic, and just bring her in, and keep her there.  Also get her spayed, please.  I hate to think about what happened to the kittens.  Most of the time they will end up getting put to sleep in a shelter since there are not enough homes for them.  Who knows if shes preg right now.  I would take her to the vet.  They can do a spay and if shes preg they will just abort the babies, which is sad, but waiting until they are born and letting them get put to sleep is sadder.<br>  <br>  Oh and as far as allergies, take Zyrtec 12 hour, twice a day.  (24 hour makes me drowsy)  Singulair works well to but I believe its prescription only.  I have terrible allergies but a huge love for animals.  I live with 3 cockatiels, 2 cats and a bunny with no problems at all.|`|ZjQqssHqaa	i dont know|`|UNFxjNHkaa	Honestly- i'd keep her in the house.  My boyfriend has allergies to cats as well - but he takes zyrtec or clariton d and the allergies disappear!  She'll live a much longer and healthier life indoors.  If you dont want this other 'owner' to keep taking her collar off then you need to keep her in your house otherwise your cat will probably keep going to them too..
SLSX6QQsaa	Don't worry.  I just went through the same exact thing with my cats a few months ago.  My female was spayed and when I brought her home, she only wanted to cuddle with her brother (my male cat).  But he ran away from her and hissed at her for 2 WEEKS!  The vet had some suggestions which included taking a washcloth, rubbing it all over my male (the one who was hissing) and getting his scent on it.  Then going over to the female (the one who had surgery) and rubbing his scent from the washcloth all over her.  I guess a big part of this issue is the scent, your cat now smells like a bunch of other cats and the vets office.  Also, to try and lighten the mood up, I put some catnip down which they both cannot resist, and that at least got them calmed down and in the same room.  The vet also told me this hissing/anger phase only lasts typically for a week or so.  My cat was unusually upset with the situation.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	give him a bath and put a towel on the bottom of the tub or sink|`|sFPV2KbBaa	if you can, give him a bath.  he smells like a sick animal.  if he was neutered  in the hospital, wipe him down with kitty wipes.  he doesn't smell like him, otherwise there would be no problem.  if it persists, go back to the vet, with both cats, something is wrong then.|`|cc4943ac9fcbd0f784defebfcd831deeaa	Hi- I have 2 cats who lived together all their lives as well. I've also volunteered at animal shelters and so forth. This is normal. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but animals are much more senstive to smells and stuff than humans. You cat is probably just smelling other animal, medicine, etc smells on your other cat. They should be fine within a day or two.<br>  Good luck|`|AA12371168	its because he smell funny due to being at the hospital.<br>  once he is well enough give him a bath. or once he gets that smell out of fur she will relax
YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  In the USA this is called 'Binky',when a rabbit jumps/leaps & runs all over the place like a nutter! Happy or excited rabbits do this or youngsters trying to let of steam,nether the less,this is the sign of happy bunnies! Good job there! :D xxx|`|TAGC3FNOaa	If they hop around and twitch while they;re hopping around it means they're happy. little jumps of joy, mine does it all the time.|`|DIihJrUiaa	What do you mean by spaz out? Bunnies of all breeds sometimes do a little mid-air hop/kick called a binky which indicates happiness.|`|Fu7OK54kaa	Lol, all bunnies do that when they're happy! Do you mean running around in a circle and throwing their back legs about? It looks funny :P They do that when they're happy - it's normal|`|4BBjhHAnaa	MINE DOES THAT TOO!!!  I have a baby holland lop.  When he is running around the house, especially when he is around the shoes, he will do binkies, but he will also bounce directly up in the air a little and shake his head and other things like that . . . it appears almost as an involuntary movement- like when you get a shiver up your spine.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know why . . . I just take it to mean that he is really happy and is having fun.
X4O7W1Vvaa	They do normally have young cats as well and can assist in the cost of having them neutered.
Be6Dlk9Aaa	You should keep them inside your new place for the first 2 weeks. They'll hate it, but they need to get their scent all over their new home so that they can find their way back to it. When you do start letting them out, a walk on a leash to show them around a few times would also help. let them mark the trees around the area to get their bearings.|`|JsBb732Maa	You will need to keep them penned up for a couple of weeks until they understand that's their new home.When I was a kid we moved and had about 10 cats and one of them disappeared. The people that were in the house we moved out of called and said that he was there could they keep him? It was a good distance and amazing he found his way back but we let him stay.Give them time to know that's home and every thing should be good for you.Have a good move. :-)|`|t9Lup06Xaa	u can try to take them with u all so have outdoor cats they can be moved it will take time for them to get adjusted but they will not mind and if there connected to u and depend on u for food then yes take them with u.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	They will stay, but not if you let them out right away.  Even though you may provide food and shelter, their internal compass will be telling them where home is, and that is the old place.<br>  <br>  Normally, it takes from several weeks to a month or so to scramble their internal compass.<br>  <br>  Taking their beds and blankets that they use in the shed will help in keeping them at the new place, as well as feeding.  But there is still a risk.|`|XsqQHKk0aa	Since you will be moving them away from their usual spot, they might be a little irritated at first and want to rebel by exploring their new area. Make them  get used to the new home area for a little bit and show them what the outside of the house looks like for a while before letting them go exploring on their own. That way they know where to go and they don't go missing. We wouldn't want them to get lost and not know which new house is theirs.|`|rSIF5jtSaa	They'll be fine like the vet student said, The one thing that is going to kill you is the hair. Their bodies are now used to building up fur to be outside and because, they're inside now, they'll shed CONSTANTLY. It's gross.|`|dC7Xooibaa	Yes They can be relocated you may have to put them up somewhere for a few days until they get used to the place. They will do fine with time.

If it hasn't I would not let it outside because it could mate and produce more stray cats in the neighborhood. <br>  <br>  If the cat has been inside your home for a year already then it should probably remain indoors. If you are unable to continue care for the cat then I would surrender the cat to a local non-kill shelter. <br>  <br>  As for who has rights to the cat, it is you. You have taken the proper measurements for a year to ensure the cats well being. The vet bills will prove that. <br>  <br>  The issue with your neighbors violent friend is more of a local police issue since he is harassing people.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	good for you I wouldn't tell them|`|t9Lup06Xaa	first u can accuse him of curtly to an animal i would do that and if u have paid for its vet bills then it is ur cat he clearly kicked out the cat and that means he has no custody of the cat and so what if he harass u u can press charges on him yes its a lot to go through but its for the good of the cat
ac92f82f4d5b3f3af2d01d0117d482cbaa	Could be many answers here...<br>  Different breeds have different characteristics.<br>  <br>  Maybe there is only length (minus the cuticle) at the tip of the nail so the nail thins out with growth in length. Couch potato dogs who don't move around much grown thin long nails on front and back. They don't use their nails much.<br>  ---or---<br>  The front nails are meant for digging and gripping. These tend to grow longer faster than the rear. <br>  The back nails are more for traction pushing off as the dog moves or travels. These nails tend to be somewhat shorter and thicker. They wear faster than the front.<br>  ---or---<br>  There could be a heath problem...
5TM9P8tsaa	*Yes, never pay over $30. Go to the ARBA website (american rabbit breeders association) email them for a breeder near you. Rabbits get all kinds of diseases and can die real easy. I am a vet and have many myself. So do not spend that much on a rabbit. Get a chinchilla. They are much healthier.|`|8474581acbbf3af73ba609e00ff353ecaa	Pedigreed rabbits can cost a lot of money. Because these are bred by championship winners, the owners often will charge more. <br>  It's the same way a pure bred dog can cost hundreds more than a mutt. You can ask the breeder if they have "pet" quality rabbits available, rather than a "show quality" animal. Sometimes they will have a kit that is not up to show standard, and will be sold at a lower cost. Worth a try!
3hBQz33Yaa	My 8 week old puppy is having the same problem although its not really watery just extremely soft he's had his first set of shots due for the second this coming saturday. I took him to the vet just a few days ago and they tested his stool and no parasites. He got better for a day and now is having it again. I think mine needs a food change which i will talk to about with my vet. You should probably make a call to your vet they will do a stool sample check as they did with mine and check for parasites and other problems if it doesn't resolve he might need a food change. Make sure until you get him to the vet though that you are offering him water so he doesn't become dehydrated puppies can become dehydrated very quickly. Good luck.|`|o93EwErKaa	If he is drinking and eating, then the most likely cause is an intestinal parasite.

wF52XMxAaa	Contrary to the apparently popular belief, your common blow dryer doesn't contain teflon.  It's a non-stick coating.  What is a blow dryer in danger of sticking to?  Curling irons, hair straighteners, or curlers often contain teflon, but not blow dryers.<br>  <br>  Whether to blow dry a parrot depends largely on how warm and humid your house is.  Even if it's cool, if the humidity is high the bird probably doesn't need blow-drying.  With low humidity, though, a thoroughly soggy bird would benefit from it.  And many parrots enjoy being blow-dried even if they don't really need it.<br>  <br>  There is a danger to blow dryers - some of them produce extremely hot air.  If it's uncomfortable on your hand, it's too hot for a parrot.  This problem is particularly severe in dry climates at high elevations (e.g., Denver and Albuquerque).  Even a hot blow dryer could be OK if kept far enough away from the bird.  By the time the air is two feet away from the dryer, it's cooled off a lot.  But some blow dryers are just defective (I own one. I use it to shrink heat-shrink insulation, which only shrinks over 200 degrees.  Good for heat-shrink is not so good for hair, skin, or feathers).<br>  <br>  After giving our birds showers, we first towel dry them, then blow dry them, then put them back on their cages and turn on a heat lamp for them.  We do live in a dry climate.  It may not be necessary, but the birds LOVE the blow drier.  Even if they don't need drying, it makes a good noise.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Simply turn up the heat in the house for 1-2 hours after his bath.  Won;t be that often, so you can stand the increased bills and being a little warm for yourself!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Warning:  Don't use a blowdryer to dry your cockatiel!  You can burn the cockatiel, not to mention some hairdryers give off Teflon fumes, which are toxic to all pet birds.  The best thing to do is let the bird dry off naturally or use a towel to help it dry off.|`|6KxBqnstaa	No not a good idea. Many items that heat up have a teflon coating that can release fumes and kill birds quickly. Birds do not need to be dried off as being wet signals them to preen and care for their feathers. Turn the heat up some and keep out of drafts until they are dry. I have been doing this for years with mine and they are all fine. I sometimes cover cage halfway so they can get out of any drafts they may feel. They will preen themselves dry. :) Dryers get to hot. If anything towel dry a little.|`|zBH33xb5aa	whenever i want to shower my cockatiels in the winter months i turn my heat up for a little while and don't soak them right down. i just use a spray bottle. they're quite funny when showering this way, they all flip upside down and spread their wings.|`|vjijiJT3aa	only if you have a very warm setting on it and you don't keep it directly on the bird but more of a back and fourth motion from a distance.|`|AA10089023	Cockatiel's are so full of personality aren't they?<br>  <br>  However, Cockatiels have sensitive skin, thus making them very senstive to heat or any other chemical's for that matter.

Cockatiels chill very easy and is a risk of making your little bird ill, if not placing him in a fatal situation.<br>  <br>  I wrap my little girl in a soft, dry towl after a good bath in the shower. She just adore's the shower. I make sure that the house is warm; around 75 degree's or so. Maybe, a few degree's higher due to she get's cold very easy. I keep her wraped until most of the water is drainned from her feather's then allow her on her cage to finish drying. They will do most of it when cleaning themselves.<br>  <br>  All in all, make sure your area is warm, make sure to use a soft towl when wrapping your tiel, and avoid drafty area's during the time your tiel is wet to keep from chill.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck on having your addition to the family.|`|Cypocpabaa	I used a blow dryer on a low setting for my cockatiel and he LOVED it. Just hold it a ways back so its not too hot, just a little warm. If you let your bird sit on your hand, you can feel the heat of the air that is hitting your bird. If its too warm for your hand, to warm for the bird.  My bird never got sick or anything from fumes, but I never knew that blowdryers gave off fumes.|`|Lx2eydLcaa	You should not blow dry the bird because the blow drier could let off fumes. you should only bathe the bird if you are in a warm invierment or your house is warm so it can naturally dry.|`|09e41Hdwaa	Do you have a heater in your bathroom?  After my tiel bathes I attach a toy to his shower perch and leave him in there with the heater on for about an hour.  I check on him every 10-15 minutes to make sure it isn't too warm.|`|wrxd8M84aa	Would you like a fried dead bird?<br>  <br>  I would suggest not.
YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  For a rabbit no more than 4-5lbs you can cut their feed down to 1/4 cup,per day. Yes the protein level sounds good,no more than 16% for adult non breeding rabbits. Hay should always be plentiful--correct--! Salt or Mineral spools aren't needed for a rabbits fed a balanced diet,like yours,in fact they can give an over dose of salt etc,. Rabbits love to graze,so yes a little nibble here & there is ideal.<br>  <br>  To be perfectly honest: You are an ACE rabbit owner,you needn't ask this question! :) I bet your rabbits are really happy & content! There should be more owners like you! Don't worry,you are doing G R E A T!<br>  <br>  Keep up the ace work,best wishes.xxx|`|qeOlkRM0aa	It sounds like you are doing a great job.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	How big are the rabbits? For a mid-sized to larger rabbit, 1/2 cup is a good amount, but if they're on the smaller side, it might be a bit too much. Make sure you're feeding a quality pellet made from timothy if they're adult rabbits!<br>  <br>  I'd up their veggie intake a bit. I'd recommend leafy greens over things like carrots and apples. Try kale, parsley, darker lettuces, chards...maybe work up to about 1/2 cup a day per rabbit, but get there slowly. My rabbit loves carrots and fruit (especially banana!) but those shouldn't be the only veggies and fruits offered. <br>  <br>  They don't really need the salt wheel, probably doesn't do any harm but in general a waste of money. <br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of keeping rabbits outside, but it sounds like you're doing a good job of protecting them from the weather. <br>  <br>  If you want to save time with your cage cleaning, have you considered litter training them? That way, you'd only have to empty the litter box instead of cleaning the whole cage. I have a litter-trained rabbit and non-litter-trained guinea pigs, and the rabbit is infinitely less work. <br>  <br>  Also, you might want to give them a little more "out of cage" time. My rabbit can run around for HOURS! Rabbits don't really have room to be active in any cage, even large cages. Some rabbits like to be held, but most just want FREEDOM every once in a while!<br>  <br>  Anyway, sounds like you care a lot about those rabbits. If you've got questions or just want to do some reading, <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/</a> has a lot of good FAQs and articles on all aspects of rabbit keeping!

I bet she is not even the proper age to be having a litter and no health testing has been done either right!! Oh and you feed purina dog food right..<br>  <br>  Good grief people will never learn. You should have to have a lic to own an animal|`|o93EwErKaa	Read everything you can.  Some good sites are <br>  <br>  www.debbiejensen.com <br>  <br>  www.dogbreedinfo.com/whelping|`|PM23RDycaa	Under 4lbs. Seriously what were you thinking? And your vet is an IDIOT frankly.  No reputable breeder in their right mind would breed a female under 4/5 pounds at all. Only bybs and puppy mills do because they don't care about the mother's safety.<br>  <br>  Chihuahua's are already at a high risk for c-section and you have just upped that risk. Honestly I recommend having her spayed and the litter aborted. Do you plan to stay home the last week of her pregnancy 24/7 JUST to make sure that someone is always around to watch her?<br>  <br>  That's the problem with BYBs they don't take into consideration that fact regardless of size they are putting the life of their female at risk. Good breeders do at least and this is why they spend YEARS learning to breed before ever producing a litter.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Here, i would read over the questions on the link below and find a way to answer them. They may save your dog should she have complications: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.learntobreed.com/questions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.learntobreed.com/questions.ht...</a><br>  <br>  I would also have your vet be on call starting at around day 60 or sooner, that way if she goes into labor early he will be in office or ready to help. <br>  <br>  Be prepared to rush her in for a c-section - MOST Chi's need them. Even a slightly bigger male could mean big puppies, which could mean problems and death of the b*tch.<br>  <br>  I assume you've had x-rays taken? If not, do so within the next week. That will tell you how many puppies to expect (which can alert you to possible complications if she stops whelping) and can give a rough estimate of their size - that right there could immediately tell you "she'll need a c-section."<br>  <br>  In fact, i would just ask your vet if you can schedule her for a c-section regardless. That way you don't have to worry about whelping complications or losing her to them. It may be your safest bet. If you don't wish to do this, i suggest a trip to the local library or book store to pick up some dog breeding/whelping books.<br>  <br>  Also talk to your vet about HOW to help during whelping if needed.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Please have a couple of thousand dollars in case she needs a c-section. Know the location of an emergency vet in case he is needed. Have a friend come help when the time comes if at all possible. Take time off work to be there because a chihuahua should not be left alone during labor. Too many things can go wrong. Hope everything is okay.|`|Bw18seFqaa	why did you breed your dog without research and the guidance of a breed mentor?<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to see if its too late to spay/abort this litter.. that will be safer for her, and cheaper for you.   If its too late, make sure you have at least $3,000 or so for emergency care.  Chis often need cecarians to deliver.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	Sell all your worldly goods and your children if you have any to help pay for the c-section and aftercare she is almost sure to require, then you can have her spayed and work on saving to buy back your children and your possessions.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Have an emergency vet lined up with 24 hr service. Chi often need a c-section. If she is having trouble a quick trip to the vet is all that will save her and the Puppies. I have raised dogs years ag, and sometimes things start of OK, but then a pap is stuck or is presented sideways. I had a Pug that needed vet assistance and on one occasion a Scottish Deerhound. You would think some thing as big as a Deerhound wouldn't have problems, but she carried so many puppies that her contractions just quit and she had to go to the vet too. Just be prepared.|`|AA12196139	The first thing you should do is take the mother to the vet to make sure she is healthy.<br>  <br>  This will give you an indication of if there might be complications or not.<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4392603_prepare-birth-litter-puppies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4392603_prepare-...</a> <br>  <br>  Also, contact other Chihuahua breeders and ask them questions.

That's begging for a c-section and possibly even death. <br>  <br>  Chihuahuas are tiny and known to have birthing problems. Even if you find a male small enough, at least under 3 lbs, you have no guarantee that he'll throw small pups, as he could have come from larger parents and can throw those larger pups. You have no guarantee what she'll throw either, as just because she is small doesn't mean her parents and grandparents were either. <br>  <br>  Are you prepared to handle the guilt of her possible death? Much less the bills involved with trying to save her. Sure your vet doesn't foresee any complications. It's not his dog, and this is his source of income!<br>  <br>  Having puppies is hard work, having chihuahua puppies, even harder. Do you work full time? What will you do if she goes in to labor while you are at work? What if she doesn't live, or does and doesn't make enough milk? Are you available every 2 hours day and night to feed those pups?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it. I have a 3.5 lb female chihuahua of my own. She's beautiful!!! Would probably make gorgeous puppies. Not that I'll ever know. I wouldn't even have her spayed because I was concerned about the risks of surgery. I'm certainly not risking her to pregnancy! She means the world to me, and I can't picture if anything terrible was to happen to her, much less something that was my fault such as breeding.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your little girl, and leave the breeding to the experts.<br>  <br>  Edit: OMG, just reread your post. You've already bred her? Without doing any research?? I'll be praying for her.|`|XagPxe7Faa	These are issues you should have researched and prepared for BEFORE you decided to join the ranks of the BYBers and breed her, don't you think?|`|AA10500537	watch her close and pray she makes it thru .|`|b0tWdr2Faa	I am im your same position and I am fed up of people acting like the know it all's of the world forbidding anyone else but themselves to be a chihuahua breeder. If they want to be useful they should give you as much information as possible rather than go on and on about how wrong it is! Your chihuahua is already pregnant and I am sure you will be absolutely fine! Anyway there is nothing you can do :) I have two chihuahuas myself and I hope to breed them soon too. I am sorry I can't provide any useful information but I am in the process of looking for it myself. Good Luck I hope it works out really well :)

And, every individual dog is different, even dogs of the same breed. So, even 2 dogs of the same breed can mature at slightly different rates.

svrFBaENaa	No, don't remove the old silicone. That's what's holding your tank together. For a 150 gallon tank, a very high grade of silicone is used to keep it from flying apart when there's 1200 pounds of water pushing against the sides.<br>  <br>  Get some aquarium safe silicone. Be absolutely sure it's safe for aquariums. If it doesn't say it is, assume it's not. Drain the tank, let it dry, then run a bead along the inside of the seam that's leaking. Smooth it out with either a tool or your finger, let it cure for 48 hours, fill and check for leaks.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	you should call Petco.They'll probably be able to tell you.If you know exactly where it is leaking you could probably get away with just redoing that one spot instead of the whole tank.|`|AA11951559	Go to Youtube.com.

yoS4cAszaa	They're pretty awsome. They eat dry food but they also eat crickets (it could be like a treat for them). They have a soft underbelly so you can hold them but you can also hold them when they are in their ball. It's pretty prickily but it doent hurt too bad. My hedgehog bit me once n it hurt like H*ll but they normally don't unless theyre scared. You can just keep them in a tank with shavings that you have to change once n a while. Toys would be nice.|`|UgvLTFmSaa	Besides having a peaceful and humorous nature, hedgehogs readily lend themselves to just about anyone's lifestyle and schedule. Being diurnal (awake parts of both day and night) just like house cats, nearly everyone can find a time of day in which to enjoy them. They do not require a great deal of room in which to live and their dietary requirements are very easy to meet and, since they are solitary animals by nature they neither require nor want the companionship of another animal.<br>  <br>  Unlike hamsters, Guinea Pigs and other small rodents, pet hedgehogs do not give off any appreciable odor and they are easily litter trained. They live much longer than rodents, too. With the proper care and diet, your pet can live to be 4 - 7 years old. Add to all of this the fact that they require no immunization shots and are very disease resistant and you can see why so many people consider hedgehogs to be the perfect pet.<br>  They are quiet, they are very easy to travel with. Most people aren’t even aware that a pet hedgehog is nearby. Many hotels that restrict other animals such as cats and dogs will allow hedgehogs. Once trained to a litter box, an adult can pretty well have the run of the house. With its excellent sense of smell, keen eyesight and good memory, it will know where the litter box is and will use it on a regular basis. Because they are not a rodent, they have no body odor, but it is still important to clean the litter box daily to eliminate all smells. Some people are not comfortable with a loose pet, so a cage with a minimum floor area of 16 x 24” will keep it happy and secure.<br>  <br>  Hedgehogs truly are a low maintenance pet. Your pet hedgehog should be kept indoors at normal room temperature (65 to 80oF); it can be fed a good quality dry cat food or a specially formulated hedgehog food; they don't bark, although when happy, some will emit a quiet purr; they do not climb curtains or chew on furniture; and, they do not ask to be taken out for a walk. All that your pet asks for is to be fed and watered, loved and appreciated. Besides simply being enjoyed as pets, there is also an active hobby.|`|crw44vnRaa	I had a hedgehog when I was pretty young so I don't remember a whole lot about it other than she was very friendly because we got her at a young age, and she licked the dust off everything, they use their dusty spit as a coating over their quills.
Rrpb5aLMaa	Play with your Shih Tzu so it can work off its excess energy and provide plenty of toys, rotating them frequently so they remain interesting. Provide your puppy with a “puppy-proofed” area (perhaps behind a baby gate) that is safe for him to explore, and do not allow him unsupervised opportunities to get into mischief. It is much easier to reinforce desirable behavior than to break bad habits. <br>  <br>  Barking<br>  Many toy breeds and small dogs are known to yap, scream or bite ankles. While Maltese dogs are not given to excessive barking, they will generally sound the alarm at noises in the night. In fact, legend has it that the ancient Romans would use the Maltese as alarm dogs[citation needed], and raised them with Rottweilers, or a proto-Rottweiler breed. Intruders would first be confronted with the diminutive Maltese, only to be later confronted with their more formidable companions.<br>  <br>  An Australia-wide research project (but not Tasmania) in conjunction with RSPCA found owners likely to dump their Maltese terriers,[3] citing their tendency to bark constantly.<br>  <br>  Also make sure your puppies are getting ALOT of excerise. tired puppies are quite puppies.|`|8accb9ae01507e9d4e1ed55a7caec396aa	Bark collars work very well.

Your cat has entered the territory of another male cat and is probably just learning the ropes and finding his place in the pecking order.  <br>  As a home owner, I think your cat needs to be tied in the yard.  My dogs are not allowed to roam free and do their business where ever they want, so why should your cat?  The local SPCA loans out cat traps so that owners can learn this lesson.  <br>  I have heard of people leaving out poison for stray cats that come in their yards and crap in flower beds and gardens.  You need to look after your cat and not have it roaming the neighbourhood, or one day it probably won't come back.|`|ZxOGKZOkaa	I love to give educated answers.  You don't spay a male cat, you neuter them.  It does not mutilate them.  My cats still have their "noogies" but they have been neutered.  Neutering does several things for your male cat.  Since he is in a new place, he is creating "his territory" and other cats will fight with him.  The hormones emited by his testes cause this.  Having him neutered will discontinue the hormones that cause this behavior.  It will also discontinue his behavior of creating HIS territory.  He will be the same cat you know, but a little more docile.  My large male orange cat, who is neutered is the dominant cat in our house.  It's not the hormones, it's the size in his case.  They don't need their noogies to produce their dominance over other cats.  There are also medical reasons to have the cat neutered.  It will help to prevent certain cancers and other afflictions, infections and diseases of the reproductive organs.  A cat that still has his hormones raging can be unpredictable.  If there is an unspayed female in the area, he will go to great lengths to get toher.  And he WILL get to her and produce unwanted kittens.  If he can't find an unspayed female, he can get very "moody" and frustrated.  Emotionally, it's kind to neuter and spay. The Catster.com website send me an e-mail.

It is mating season, and every male cat within 500 miles of a female in heat will be fighting. Why? For the right to mate with her! Just because you don't see him doing it doesn't mean he isn't. <br>  He will never be accepted. The males in the area have staked out their territory and he will never be welcome to invade it. Males typically run off trespassers. Your cat could go missing.<br>  You showed your lack of education by referring to neutering as "mutilating." All the scientific evidence in the world has proven it is better for cats. It makes them less anxious, less aggressive, less likely to fight, less likely to spray, and totally eliminates the risk of certain reproductive cancers. It is never too late to have it done. Unless of course, you wait until your cat has been killed by a rival.<br>  Simple: To keep your cat from fighting, keep him in. To cut down on fighting, get him fixed. Both great solutions, and less costly than some of the potential surgeries that could arise from the fights he gets into.|`|CadIYXdXaa	This probably isn't the answer you want, but keep him indoors. Only let him outside on a leash and when supervised.|`|II5N7XYKaa	Get your cats fixed and keep them inside.  There, problem solved.|`|qirvQxvzaa	Keep him indoors.|`|AA11170074	First, to ask a question knowing "everyone is going to say to have him spayed" to me means you know what you need to do and you're looking to us to validate what you want to do instead of telling you to do the right thing. In addition to the fights, injuries to your cat and others, and unsupervised procreation that you are turning a blind eye to there are numerous other dangers you're exposing your cat to for your convenience. How are you going to feel when he doesn't come home because he drank antifreeze or sheltered on a car engine for warmth and gets injured or killed?<br>  Do the responsible thing here. Get him neutered and keep him indoors or take him to a no-kill animal shelter or rescue so he can be given the care he deserves.
2fB383F2aa	My cat has been strictly indoor for over a year until our house was built and we moved in. She won't go near the front door back she'll sit out on the balcony with us or the back deck. She won't venture off anywhere else. I also noticed she's a bit skittish the first few seconds out until she settles, but she needs the door left open she she can run in easily if she has a fright. If we close the door behind her she whines until we open it so she can run in.|`|qirvQxvzaa	She may be frightened at first but she will adjust to the new surroundings. Cats know where their home is but sometimes they don't come back for a few reasons: killed, someone took them in, their at an animal shelter. I do not let my cats out. I have learned the hard way I've lost  animals due to being stolen hit by car or a sickness they picked up. Hope this helps|`|ptNy4uicaa	Your cats life expectancy will greatly diminish. There are so many risks when you let your cat out. <br>  <br>  Hit by car, cat fights, reproducing, other pets, wild animals, someone bringing it to the pound, other people keeping it etc etc.... honestly its not worth it. Look up the statistics.. a indoor cat on average lives ore then twice as long as one that has the option to go out side! I have 5 cats.. none of them are allowed out. Its not worth risking their lives!|`|AA11170074	Why would you let your cat outdoors in the first place? If she drinks antifreeze while she's out somewhere or climbs into a car engine for warmth and gets hurt you're really going to be sorry. Cats that live strictly indoors are exposed to fewer dangers and so live healthier happier lives and you have fewer vet bills maintaining her good health instead of patching her up later.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Don't do it! She'll get lost, stolen, ran over by a car, poisoned, or killed by a dog or other animal. She's a housecat, just keep it that way, to keep her safe. Housecats are just as happy as indoor/outdoor cats, and a lot safer.|`|ad3b5cd523444e3461eb988f6ede1f97aa	the answer is no, the cat is not used to being out alone . and will more than likely get ran over by a car of poisoned , if it is an inside cat it needs to stay an inside cat, my cat is 12 and he never goes out unsupervised i have him on a harness but he was fixed when he was a baby|`|pDv13gJwaa	keep your kitty with you and supervised by you.  By doing this you display that you are a responsible pet owner. If you let it run all over the neighborhood and it becomes a pest to someone like me there is no telling where it may end up.|`|II5N7XYKaa	There's no good reason to make her an outdoor cat.  It's dangerous to her and to wildlife.  Please keep her inside where she belongs.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	I would get her spayed and get her vaccines and KEEP HER AS A GOOD INDOOR CAT.  don't force her to go out in that nasty outside world where no good ever comes to cats.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	My cats are 100% indoor cats. I would not want them outside. I'm afraid they will get lost and not know where they live or get hit by a car which is my biggest fear. I love my cats very very much and they are like another kid in the house...lol They do love the windows though, they pretty much own them. They are spayed too. If I was you, I would keep her inside unless you put a leash on her and take her outside like that, at least you will be with her and she will not get lost or hit...Good Luck!! Cats Rules :o)|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I raised a beautiful baby from 4 weeks old.  When she was about a year old, I let her outside.  She was fine for 3 months but then one day she didn't come home.  A coyote most likely caught her.  That was years ago and since then I have never let a cat outside unsupervised.  We live and learn and the ones who pay are our babies.  The dangers for outside cats are countless.  My mother had an outside cat for 12 years then she was killed from eating a poisoned mouse.  I see everything from kttens to adult cats lying on the roadsides from being hit by cars.  Cats are much safer indoors.|`|AA11589437	1. First get her spayed.<br>  2. You must realise that letting her out may scare her and she will be exposed to all sorts of dangers. Why don't you keep her inside and just make an enclosure for her to play outside?<br>  3. Make sure to put a tag on her, with your phone, if you let her out.<br>  4. cats are strange creatures. My cat is scared when he goes out, even in his carrier. But once that he got out, his panicky reaction was to run away, not to come back inside. Luckily we caught him.|`|AA12196812	My cat was strictly indoors for 5 years. Then I moved to where I had a back yard. The cat did not even want to step out on the porch! In three summers, she got used to it and now even steps out beyond the porch, into the grass. But she always remains close and darts back into the house under slightest alerts.|`|IuYekkPVaa	My current two cats were indoor only for the first three years of their lives because I lived in an apartment. Whilst our female cat seemed content with this lifestyle, our male cat wasn't and constantly tried to find ways to escape.  He would sit by the door every night and howl for hours in the hope that we would let him out.  (Both were spayed/neutered as kittens)<br>  <br>  I live on a small mediterranean island where there are no predators or rabies, so all cats here get to go outside.  Last summer I moved to a house on small complex with private gardens and I decided to allow them to go outside during the daytime if they wanted to.  They both enjoy spending time outside and because they still use their litter tray and I feed them small meals several times a day, they are always in and out of the house.  Neither of them go very far or are outside for more than an hour at a time.  Our female is highly territorial, so she stands guard on our patio area most of the time, and the male cat likes playing in the open field next door.  Now that the weather is much colder, they prefer to spend most of the time indoors.  My only rule is that they are not allowed outside overnight because that's when most car accidents happen.<br>  <br>  Whether your cat will enjoy going outside or not will depend upon her personality.  Your home is her core territory and cats won't abandon a good one without reason and this is why she will want to come home every day.  The scent glands on their paws leave a trail wherever they walk, and it's their sense of smell that guides them home. In addition to spaying, flea treatments and vaccinations, I'd suggest that you microchip her, so that if she does go missing it will make it easier for her to be reunited with you.<br>  <br>  If have any concerns about her wandering too far, you might want to consider installing cat proof fencing in your garden and these links have advice on how to do that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/info.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/in...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.purrfectfence.co.uk/about_us.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.purrfectfence.co.uk/about_us....</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide.
AA10332192	I prefer 2 tanks.  Its far safer.<br>  <br>  A tank divider can work, but they are finicky and placement needs to be perfect.  Baby fish can slip through amazingly small spaces and they will do so if they can.<br>  <br>  I used to do all my guppy grow outs in a heated 5 gallon with a sponge filter and they did very well until they went into the show tanks.<br>  <br>  Endler's can be even smaller when born and probably will slip through the temporary dividers along the sides.  If you silicone it in, it would be safer, but I still suggest 2 tanks.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kLD1AbiPaa	The separator will work if you can get it in so theres no gaps, but all of them that ive tried always leave little gaps around it. so there would always be one or two baby guppies that would sneak over to the other side, but if your starting with an empty 10gallon it might be easier to get the divider in the right way.|`|5XnypZkVaa	It will work. If you want extra precaution then they sell caulk at the pet store or hardware store and you can seal the sides so they cant slip through|`|DU7iO8EHaa	Just keep them in the ten gallon, they will be divided.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes that will work good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish|`|IrdZKYT3aa	It should work just fine, make sure there aren't any gaps around the sides and especially at the bottom.  It ought to work just great!<br>  Best of Luck!|`|AraBfesHaa	If you're talking about the kind yu buy at the store that's made of a screen like material kind of, yes it will work as long as you push it down into the gravel a bit so they can't sneak underneath it.  But why do you want to separate them this early?  They can't breed until they are adolescents, probably 2 months old.  If you have the option of getting the 2 smaller tanks, I would just do that.  Less of a hassle, and more sure-fire.|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	yep they will be fine in the 10 and the divider will indeed keep them apart.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	As long as there is no space for them to slip through, it would work.|`|pf5G6ssJaa	yea there be seperate

And even then some will mature and not even tolerate each other.<br>  <br>  Tiger Barbs need 25-30 gallons to shoal. They would fight with the Puffers and lose.<br>  <br>  In a tiny 6 gallon the only puffers that would fit are Dwarves, Carinotetraodon travancoricus, if you have anything other than that you're tank is overstocked.

Uy79dKEmaa	Congratulations on your new kitten, and thanks for saving a life!  To make your new kitty comfy the minute he comes in, you'll need the basics of course:  litterbox, litter, litter scoop, several scratching posts/pads (different textures/vertical/horizontal), food and water bowls (not plastic), carrier, cat bed (optional-they sleep wherever), and food (more on that later).  You can buy toys, or make your own.  Kittens love the little furry mice, but they love wadded up paper balls, paper bags, rings from the milk carton just as well.  Wand toys (like "Da Bird") are always a big hit in my house, as well as "kitten mittens".  <br>  <br>  As you are transitioning your kitty into his new home, it is important to not upset his little stomach. Make sure to get some of the food he is already used to.  However, don't get too much since you'll want to slowly switch him over to a healthier food.  Wellness, Merrick, and Natural Balance are just a few of the better brands.  You'll need to go to a pet store to get the better brands, or order on-line.  The main thing to look for in the food is that there should be no corn, wheat, glutens or by-products.  No unidentified "meat" or "animal" ingredients either (those can literally be any kind of animal--if they were proud of it, they'd name it).<br>  <br>  Since he's a boy kitty, urinary tract health is a concern.  A wet food diet will help ensure that he gets enough moisture in his diet which helps prevents crystals from forming.  Wet food is more species appropriate as well.<br>  <br>  Make sure you switch his food over slowly by mixing a little bit of the new with the old and gradually increase the amount of new.  After a couple weeks, he should be eating 100% of the new food.<br>  <br>  I wish many happy years with your new friend!|`|5I01tsgYaa	There's going to be an adjustment period regardless of how well prepared you are.  In addition to all the stuff you are already getting, you will need bowls for food and water and a scratching post.  Also, when you adopt the kitten ask the people at the shelter what kind of food he's on and what kind of litter they use.  If you get the same kind to start out with, it will help with the adjustment. If you plan on using a different brand food or litter, you will need to wean him off what he's currently on over a period of about a month.<br>  Congratulations!|`|cn68rflCaa	Congrats! well bringing home a new kitten is always fun. Make sure your new kittten feels at home. Even though hes allready litter trained make sure when you bring him home you put him in his litter box. If he comes out keep puting him in. This way he will know where his litter box is. Also make sure the food dish is away from the litter box. If it is too close to the box, your cat might smell the box and he wont eat. Most likely your cat wont use a cat bed, but its always good to get one anyway. I would think about getting a cat tower. My cat loves hers.<br>  For food, I would consider getting purina pro plan. It will make your cats fur so shiny and soft. Get lots of toys and a good size cat carrier.<br>  Good luck with the new kitten and i hope this helped!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I would set up a "nursery" for the kitten for a few days.  A big, strange space can be overwhelming to a new kitten and can cause him to hide and have accidents.  He'll feel much more secure in a small space and you can gradually introduce him to larger areas as he grows more comfortable there.  <br>  <br>  Find out which food he's been eating at the shelter and gradually change his food if you don't continue feeding that.  A sudden change in foods can cause tummy upset.<br>  <br>  Kittens do very well in pairs so if you can swing it, I'd get 2 kittens.  That way he doesn't feel so "alone" in his new surroundings.  If not, just give him lots of love and attention. Never force him to be held as he will see that as aggression and be scared.<br>  <br>  A good tall cat tree is something I would never be without as a cat owner.  Even when my guys were tiny, they loved to jump and climb on it.  Getting him used to one at a young age can curtail inappropriate scratching later on.<br>  <br>  Sounds like your little guy is headed for a great life.  all I can add is look into pet insurance or set up an emergency fund of about $200 in case he gets sick.  It will save you alot of worry.<br>  <br>  This is my favorite cat care website.  The articles are full of right on advice for everything from what to feed your kitty to behavioral issues.<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|AA11170074	In addition to what everyone has said before me....<br>  You'll want to start him out in just one room so that he's not trying to adjust to too much at once and you'll also know he's safe even if you can't find him if you confine him to one room.<br>  We have two dogs and a cat and the cat box, food, etc. are all in our office where we have a door we can close. Now that the cat is adjusted to her surroundings we keep a baby gate in the doorway so she can come and go as she pleases but also has a place she can retreat to if she wants to be alone.<br>  If he's got claws you're also going to want to get nail clippers, some styptic powder in case you make a mistake, and advice from you vet on how to clip his claws. You want to start getting him used to the uncomfortable things like nail cutting and brushing before he gets older and can fight harder when he's scared.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Some sort of cat tree or cardboard scratcher. Do not go overboard on toys, simple things like ping pong balls, pom poms & rubber jacks (kids toys) make great toys. Don't spend a fortune. Paper sacks & empty boxes are as much fun as fancy/expensive toys.<br>  <br>  Make sure that the bed is easy to wash, mine prefer the "donut shaped" ones.|`|soVgzyvHaa	Both of my cats LOVE to be brushed.  A soft brush would be good, cats also love toys made of basically trash.  (plastic grocery bags, foil, tp rolls)  and also get a good cat shampoo for fleas.  Even though your keeping him inside, you might track in eggs off your shoes or clothes, and if you are not prepared, that can be a mess.|`|vmCn7E8Xaa	you should get it some cat toys, a scratch post, a litter scoop (unless you want to use your hands, ha ha), feed bowls, water bowls, fleeces, throws, cat litter, grooming brushes and/or combs.|`|gkgPHzg4aa	You should ask your landlord if your allowed to even have a kitten in the apartment.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Since its a kitten, are there littermates there?  You may want to consider getting 2 cats instead of just 1, cats LOVE to have a playmate (especially since he will probably be spending some time home alone) and a litter mate will make a perfect companion.  Also consider the food that the shelter is feeding them.  You want to switch your cats diet over slowly, so get the food the shelter feeds them at first then slowly switch over (do a 1/4 new 3/4 old mix for a few days, then 1/2 1/2 etc.... ).  Also, make sure you have a camera :)  You don't want to miss those awkward first days as your kitten begins to realize hes safe and has a home to love him now.  Its an amazing transition.  Good luck!!!|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	a good scratch post and/or some cat furnature.<br>  <br>  I would go to petco and get some Wellness brand kitten formula dry food.<br>  <br>  congrats on the new addition to the family!
6SeWCfUfaa	Congratulations!!!  You've raise a perfect 3 year old human child!!  But wait, you wanted a dog, didn't you?<br>  <br>  Training is what this dog needs.  And it's going to take some work.  He's going to have to learn that he can be away from you and everything will be ok.  One of the best ways to teach this is to teach a long down/stay.<br>  <br>  Now, most of us can put our dogs in a stay, and it will stay so long as we're watching it stay.  But what happens if you leave the room when the dog is in a stay?  He gets up and follows you right?  So what you'll want to do is teach him NOT to do that.<br>  <br>  To teach a long, down/stay without you around you're going to need about 30 mins a day.  The dog will basically be in the down/stay for the entire 30 mins.  The trick here is that you keep a close eye on him and don't stand in one place the entire time.  Put him in a down/stay and see if he will let you walk around him.  If he gets up, it's no, down/stay.  And try again.  Every time he pops up, it's no, down/stay and physically putting him back into the down.<br>  <br>  You should be able to walk around and step over your dog and walk around the room within sight of the dog without him breaking that down.  This will take a lot of practice.  So spend the entire half hour keeping him in the down and wandering about the room.  Every now and then, even if he's in the down, return and reenforce the down command by telling him down and giving him the hand signal again.<br>  <br>  Once he gets this down, grab a chair.  You'll see a change their too.  The second you sit, he'll start thinking he can break the stay.  Get to where he'll let you wander around the room, stepping over him, sitting, back to standing, back to sitting without breaking that down.<br>  <br>  Work with some distractions too.  Get a ball, a frisbee, other toys ... bounce the ball, does he break the stay?  Yup, put him back.  Throw a toy (where you know you can get it before he does) does he go for it or stay.  Work that until he stays.<br>  <br>  Now, this is the part that will really start building his independence from you.  Once he can do all of the above.  You're going to get a chair, start about three feet from the dog while he's in the down and start moving that chair back away from him, you're going to turn it around so your sitting facing away from him, you're going move that chair out the doorway into the hallway.  The idea is to make sure he stays in that stay no matter if you're sitting, standing, in the room or out of the room.  Check back with him to make sure he's still in the EXACT spot you left him, in the down.  If not, put him back in the exact spot before downing him again.  <br>  <br>  What the dog will learn during this process is that he does not have to be with you every second and that you do not need to be in his sight every second.  Eventually, he will either stop following you to the bathroom or you should be able to get him in a down/stay long enough to get in there by yourself (if you do, don't come out if he's whinning and carrying on.  Only come out when it's quite.  Bring a book.)<br>  <br>  Just so I'm clear.  You work this for 30 mins and then stop.  If he pops up every 30 seconds at first, that's ok.  You only go for the 30 mins then stop for the day.  And give him a day off every now and then and if you can, play ball or something really fun after this stay sessions.<br>  <br>  It's a long process but you've got a lab.  Labs learn fast.  You can do it.|`|24CFl7sjaa	You might be unconsciously giving him too much attention, try and be more conscious of how much interaction you have with the dog, make a note for a couple of days if its helps.<br>  If you do find he is constantly getting attention of any kind even shouted at, you need to learn to totally ignore him, which includes not speaking to him. I had a very clingy rescue who was to be frank an absolute nightmare unless he could see me at all times, and he wanted to be right next to me and god forbid I shut him out. I had to learn to completely ignore him, to the extent I pretended that he wasnt there at all. Its tough but it does sink in. He now can be left in his own bed without crying constantly and has stopped knocking everything over and going through doors to lie next to me. When he settles leave him for 10 minutes then call him to you and pet him and reward him, then send him away again. Eventually he will learn that he gets treated when he comes to you on your demand, not when he demands you. I can safely go to the toilet and walk across the yard now without having a 7 stone baby hanging on my every step. It will work.<br>  Make sure he is also getting enough exercise to tire him out enough to nap in the day and provide him with toy distraction so he doesnt think about chewing something treasured up as he is being ignored and you wont want to spoil it by telling him off for chewing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OxFsslN8aa	Although it's great that he gets a lot of attention, are you exercising him?  A lab needs to run or at the very least walk for about 3 miles a day.  They need to have jobs - retreiving and hunting.  If you exercise both his mind & body sufficiently every day, he should be happy to lie down and rest when commanded to do so.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	First of all, you need to establish boundaries. Your dog needs to learn what areas of the home is off limits to him, for one. Two, you need to ignore him when he is demanding attention. Don't give him anything, don't pet him, don't play with him, and don't talk to him when he is expecting you to give him attention. When he is being good, then you can give him some attention. Your dog also needs to learn to be inside a crate. The reason he freaks out and yelps is because he feels that he is being seperated from you. Put him in it, let him protest for a while, and tell him Quiet. When he is quiet, tell him he's a good boy. Repeat these steps. He will learn. The crate is a great tool that you can use to help him with his seperation anxiety. the dog I'd adopted from a shelter had that issue, and it took me about a week to get him over that. Put him in the crate when you are going to be in the kitchen. Put him in there when you can't supervise him. When you need time to yourself for any reason, and don't want the dog laying on your feet, either put him out in the yard for a while or put him in the crate.If he is a barker, get him a bark collar as well.|`|yMS9wgfWaa	take him on walks or play with him often.....if that doesnt word snuggle with him|`|AA10500537	he;s lonely and needs ypur attention .<br>  'spend time with him then put him in a crate|`|cSOwqXKxaa	Sounds like he didn't get any training from his previous home, either.<br>  <br>  Your dog is being dominant and literally pushing you around.  You need to pick up a book or two and get your family in to a training class - even a PetSmart class at this point will help you, but since he's an adolescent male (not neutered, I imagine?) you need to set the family rules and boundaries right away.  And get your butt outside and walk him!  All dogs should have at least an hour's walk a day to release their energy, but labrador retrievers are working dogs and he should really have more than hour.  He'll only get more neurotic and pushy if you don't exercise him properly.<br>  <br>  I highly suggest 'Puppies for Dummies' (I know he's not a puppy, but it has great tips on establishing routines and basic dog care) as well as Cesar Millan's 'Be the Pack Leader' (bring it on, Thumbs Down!).  <br>  <br>  Give him something to do.  Teach him the basic commands - Come, Sit, Stay, Down, Off, Leave It.  Give him Kong toys that exercise his mind and jaws.  Just keep him active, mentally and physically, and he won't be such a monster to live with.  And be consistent in the rules!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|h71XGaqgaa	haha this kinda reminds me of my six sisters.  i have three dogs myself.   what we did to get them to stop following up we just gave them a toy and playing fetch is the best because you are going to them asking them to play instead of them coming to you and this will tire them out so they sleep.  i have a black lab too she is crazy she loves to play fetch and this is wat worked for us|`|nBehRANyaa	He needs training and patience.  If you've only had him a month, he hasn't learned to trust your leadership yet.  If he doesn't trust you to be a good leader, he won't trust you to be too far away from him!  A beginning obedience class would be a huge help.  You'll learn how to train him effectively, and it will help to establish you as his leader.   Do make sure he's getting adequate exercise, too.|`|nFcl0BOsaa	Give him enough exercise and he'll lie down the first place that's convenient. He won't want to expend the energy to follow you around. At least, that's what my dog does. When we get home from an hour- or longer walk, he is horizontal before he is even 6 feet inside the door. Stays that way for a nice little while.<br>  <br>  You can train a dog to stay out of the kitchen, although with a LAB it's not going to be easy. LOL You just have to be one step ahead of the dog so you can stop him at the entrance.  Use body-blocking, walking toward him to slowly drive him back, and stand with your feet apart as if you're claiming the space for yourself.  Keep at it until he gets the message that he is not going to gain access to that area. Be patient but firm. Draw an imaginary line that you don't want him to cross.He may lie down just outside that line, and that's ok.  Watch "It's Me or the Dog".<br>  <br>  I have a feeling he will outgrow some of this clingy -ness in the next year. Hang in there. When his bones and joints are finished developing, you might want to add running alongside a bike to his exercise routine. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petedge.com/Guardian-Gear-ExPETdition-Bike-Attachment-ZW80633.pro" rel="nofollow">http://www.petedge.com/Guardian-Gear-ExP...</a>|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Have you hired an actual trainer to help you with this problem?  That would probably go a long way.  If your dog does something that annoys you, then you need to train him not to do it.  There's no two ways about this.  Your only option besides training is to get rid of the dog (and that is the lazy way out).  So crates don't work.  Have you tried tethering him?  In the house.  With something to keep him occupied.  As for him being underfoot...stepping on him (carefully so as not to fall yourself when he does move) won't hurt him and it will teach him to not stand (or lay) in the way.|`|GSf09ALBaa	You have a serious problem called separation anxiety.  This cannot be fixed with your regular obedience training.  First, realize this is the humans fault not the dog and second, get in touch with a trainer who is also a behaviorist.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest getting out of the house and walking him as much as you can.  Playing ball?  Labs love to retrieve.  They also love to swim.  Give him something else to do besides follow you around.
EZ5mwUF3aa	You are correct, I have heard the same thing, it's also bad for little kids. It's best to use a natural cleaner such as vinegar (mixed with water)|`|O6r6Zqsuaa	No idea, sorry.
a2cjwMKcaa	Keep doing the water changes, every day is OK<br>  <br>  Dont do one big one as the sudden change in water conditions may shock the fish. But 20-30% changes every day will bring the nitrates down over a few days without stressing the fish.<br>  <br>  You can do big changes safely, but only if you do them regularly. If the water in the tank is not very different to your tap water, there is no big change or shock. So 50% every week is OK, 50% every 3 months, not so good.<br>  <br>  Alage is caused by a combination of light and nutrients in the water. Control it by lowing the nutrient levels (water changes) and reducing the amount of light. You probably wont stop it completely, but if you can get it down to the level where a quick wipe of the glass each week controls it, then thats OK. I would guess if they haven't changed the water, they haven't cleaned the glass either?<br>  <br>  Ian|`|DU7iO8EHaa	this could be the last process in cycling the tank|`|AA10332192	You do not mention the species of fish.  But you can do a 50% change today followed by 10% to 20% changes every other day for 10 days.<br>  <br>  If you do the math, that should reduce your nitrates to a manageable level.<br>  <br>  Unless you have some fragile fish, the water changes will not impact them too much.  Just be sure to match the temperature as best you can and the pH.<br>  <br>  As for the algae, yes, with reduced nitrates it will get better.  You will need to 'harvest' as much of the alage out as you can, but the remaining will eventually die off with regular water changes.|`|svrFBaENaa	You can do a bigger change than 5 gallons out of the 30 gallon tank. That's only a 16% water change. And if you're at 50 ppm of nitrates, that's only going to knock it down to 42 ppm. I would do a 50% change today, use a conditioner that detoxifies nitrates, such as prime or amquel, and do another 50% change in a couple days. High levels of nitrates leave your fish vulnerable to disease, if one of them catches something, it could quickly spread through the tank.<br>  <br>  That green algae needs light to grow. In addition to changing the water, I would keep the tank dark for a few days. Drape a towel over the tank if need be. The stuff does rub off, it just takes something that's a bit coarse to do it.

3YMETqStaa	Keeping a dog in its crate isn't that bad at night, if you crate train correctly, dogs actually enjoy their crates and might even nap their when they don't have too.  As for during the day, ideally you shouldn't have to crate her at all.  If it is a must like you have to run errands or work, you need to only leave her in there for a short span of time and make sure to excessively walk/socialize your dog when you can especially with a pit.  If you are working or going to school try to come home at lunch and play/walk/take to bathroom but I would suggest giving her a bigger area that she's confined to maybe a room where she can't chew or a very large crate.  Possibly thing about hiring a dog walker/playmate/pooper scooper service, it might be about 8-10 bucks a day.<br>  <br>  As for the fact that you have a power breed, I urge you to exercise twice a day and socialize them as much as possible with other dogs, people and children.  Shutting them off from the world with little or no exercise in a crate leads to aggression problems down the road.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I do not agree with crate training.  It is like putting a child in a crate & going off & leaving it there for hours on end.  No exercise, no place to relieve themselves, no human contact, just laying there all day, bored to the hilt & lonely.<br>  <br>  That is how I feel.  I know there are lots of people who use them & believe in them but for I can't see locking an animal in a cage it can't even move around in.<br>  <br>  My dogs run most of the day.  They have a big yard & good fencing.  I just can't imagine sticking them in a little kennel & leaving them there for hours.  A tied up dog has at least 6 feet to move around in but a caged dog has none.<br>  <br>  Now I can see a kennel being used as a safety spot for the dogs point of view.  When he is in the crate he is safe, no one can bother him when in his crate.  i would remove the door.<br>  <br>  I have a crate I use for my ferrets but they are never locked in there for any reason except transportation.  It sits on the floor behind the recliner & one of them likes to sleep in it.  One would rather sleep in his cage.  They are free to roam the house for a few hours each day, until they wear themselves out & then they go back to their cage.  A good sized cage.|`|2Skznsq8aa	My pit bull is crated all day.  I come home at lunch to let him out to potty and run around.  He's out at night when we're home.  These are typically high energy dogs so you just want to make sure your pup gets lots of running around exercise and play time when he's out.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	When your home...the dog is out of the crate during the day...<br>  <br>  Too much time in the crate and lack of exercise can cause anxious behaviours...|`|ecCTTc7Raa	More then 3hrs, I would say....You should give ur dog time out of the cage thoughout the day.  It is cruel to keep them locked up all day & all night. Plus, keeping them caged up can lead to being over excited and that can lead to worse things.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	i don't get this crate business?! whats wrong with having your dog sleep on the settee on a night, and have the kitchen during the day?! why get a dog if its going to be shut up in a crate 24/7! teach it to be okay in the house.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	well when you leave it in there all night is already too long.  They have robot dogs where you can turn them on/off when you please, seems that is more what your looking for, not a real live dog|`|XavY3fiWaa	A dog shouldn't be left in a crate for more than 4 hours during the day, but if the dog has be kept in there longer than that get someone to take the dog out every 3-4 hours.|`|AA10500537	if you can let it run outside you should do so .all night is fine  but during the day she should be able to  run  somewhere|`|PdaiyUkDaa	my pit is crated during day but not at night|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It is usually 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a two-month-old puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 3 hours at the most.  Depending on your dogs/puppies age, you may have to set a timer or alarm to wake yourself up and let it out to potty.  They should only be in the crate if you are not watching it, all other times it should be out practicing how to be good in the house and not eat furniture.|`|eyKx05LKaa	I wouldn't go much longer than 8 hours, and only to crate train her for potty training, etc.  This isn't something you should continue to do once she is trained.  Living a life in a cage everyday is no life for a dog.

5LjYxh8Jaa	I have wolf-dogs with some of the same problems.<br>  <br>  To get her to "go" where you want her to:<br>  Next time she holds it till she is inside-- save it.  Soak urine up in paper towels, and put towels and any feces in a ziploc bag.<br>  Then the next time you walk her, dump the ziploc bag out onto the ground.  This should trigger her instinct to cover the spot with new scent.  Keep trying- the wolf in her IS very stubborn.<br>  <br>  Your other issue: refusing to walk where YOU want her to.  This is pack leadership problems.  I'm still dealing with that myself.  It's an ongoing learning phase.  I've gotten a lot of helpful information from:<br>  <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/issues" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/issue...</a><br>  or just search   The dog whisperer.<br>  and I watch his show whenever possible.  <br>  Right now I live with 2 other adults, 3 children, 1 rot/lab mix,1 German Shepard/wolf mix, 2 wolf/husky mixes, and 6 cats.<br>  Most of the time it's calm in our animal world, with a few exceptions that I'm still working on.<br>  Good luck, and keep trying--- they are worth it.|`|xvTPUidNaa	To get your wolf dog to go outside you can bury some food in the ground in the woods. this should make your dog mark it. also walk it around the edge of the forest and tire it out. after that the dog should want to rest which sould make it more likely to pee outside. Work on your bonding with her. The stronger the bond the more likely that she will listen to your and respect you as alpha.  hope it helps.

HJ3mGLGGaa	there is such thing as american bulldog and there is such thing as english bulldog. there are both in the "non-sporting breed" meaning that they have a lot of the same characteristics. <br>  <br>  similarities: requires daily grooming to all of the wrinkles on its face (they sell "dry clothes" at most pet stores, they are unscented and get all the germs from between the wrinkles and don't need to be rinsed afterward). it is important to get him/her neutered after 6 months. they need a lot of mental activity. you need to train them at a very young age, by someone with experience. independent nature in that they don't need constant petting from you, but loyal. they need a clearly established leader. if the owner don't take the "leader of the pack" role, then the bulldog will feel the need to become leader of the house. this will cause lots of stress on the dog, which is a very bad thing to cause extra stress on bull dogs because they are already prone to thyroid disease. thyroid disease can cause aggression/stress.<br>  <br>  differences: <br>  <br>  english bulldog: i can stress how important it is to get your english bulldog neutered at 6 months. they are already so hard to train, that you don't want to deal with a dog in heat. also, english bulldogs are so man-made that they can't properly have sex or give birth. females need a C-Section when giving birth (expensive and dangerous to her life). a male dog (like all male dogs) will try to wander out of the yard in search for a female, but can not properly have sex because of their bodies, this will cause a huge amount of stress and depression on the dog.<br>  <br>  american bulldog: very territorial. again, it is so important to give the obedience and house training at a young age, and establish yourself as the leader of the pack.|`|KxjUim7yaa	The American Bulldog is much larger and looks more like a pit bull.

Have you ever seen the lil rascals, spice was an american bulldog.  The stocky ones are just known as bulldogs.  Id say if you got the cash go for the old english bulldog or the blue bulldog.  They're probably a little harder to find but they're more athletic.  One of the complaints i hear about the stock kind is they just sit around all day.  The old english also has less health problems.|`|xvTPUidNaa	The american bulldog has longer legs and a bigger head. The english is the small one that has more wrinkles. I LOVE the american bulldog. It is tall so you won't have the major joint problems that the smaller english bulldog sometimes gets. But it still has all the wrinkles. But since your son is 2 the american bulldog most likely isn't a good idea do to its size. Could hurt your kid. So the english bull dog suits you well.

Buy some mite spray and visit my source site|`|u5unaKu9aa	may be it's visiting the barber shop|`|QEFPs6mtaa	cancer is the reaction that makes them scartch and bite their fur- making it fall off. it might be cancer based on my expierence- thats wat im thinking it is!|`|10eguzBCaa	he might have mites get him checked out my a vet please|`|fGwZMglGaa	If it's got long hair then that's often normal. That's what my local vet told my friend. It had a bald patch on either side and they said that long hair hamsters often lose their fur especially if they are getting old. But you might want to check her out just in case she has mites especially if she is short haired and young.<br>  Good luck and I hope she is ok =]
hC4Z8HIbaa	I'm unsure as to what you mean by "different breeds of rat." Do you mean housing something like a Natal rat or African Soft Furred rat with something like your standard fancy rat? Or do you mean something like keeping a dumbo with a standard ear rat? If your question is more along the lines of the first example I have provided, the answer is no. Rats will typically attack anything that they feel is a threat to them, and should never be kept with animals outside their own species. This holds true for 'fancy rats,' natal rats, and ASF rats. If your question is more along the lines of the second example I have provided, the answer is they are not different breeds of rats. People who are not familiar with rats are often under the misconception that different color rats and dumbos are different breeds of rats. This is not the case. A person with red hair and a person with black hair are both humans. A person with big ears is still the same kind of human as a person with small ears. They only difference between a black furred rat and a white furred rat is the difference in the gene determining hair color. The same holds true for dumbo eared rats and standard eared rats. "Fancy rats" are all one breed and it is incorrect to regard them as individual breeds based on physical characteristics.|`|UmXBLDoIaa	YES!|`|l8gUwy2daa	You sure can, just like dogs and cats. Rats are rats and they just enjoy each others company. I do suggest that they are the same sex though or you may get some crazy crossbred babies. Good luck!
iXijnCxOaa	Unless your sheepdog mix is trained to work in some way, he has the value of a comparable mix at your closest animal shelter... in my area, that would be about $75.  It's unlikely they'll require you to sell your dog.<br>  <br>  In the case of many show breeders who have dogs that are sale-able at higher prices... bankruptcy court can require them to sell the dogs *IF* they can prove they have value and can be sold.  In a friend of mine's case, she successfully argued that the dogs were worth more if she kept them (for breeding) than if she sold them.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	A large adult mixed breed has no market value.<br>  <br>  However, I had similar concerns when I had financial problems, because my purebred show dogs COULD be conisdered to have market value, although to me they were pets and therefore priceless family members.  It's one of the reasons I never considered bankruptcy as an option.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  It shouldn't affect your dog, unless you used him as collateral on a loan.  The dog is not an asset.  The bankruptcy lawyer was talking about stocks, cars, homes, bank accounts as assets - not your family pet.|`|Bw18seFqaa	a dog with "market value" would be like a purebred show dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  A mixed breed dog is not "market value".. I wouldnt even bother to list it as an asset.   An asset is something you can sell to get money for, such as a fur coat, nice jewlery, vehicles, etc.  You wouldnt be able to get much, if anything, for a large mixed breed dog.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	You cannot be serious....<br>  <br>  MAYBE if the dog was a champion with a mile long pedigree...but a mix? <br>  <br>  I very much doubt it.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I have never heard of that happening.  To me my dogs are my children, well all my pets are my babies.<br>  <br>  What kind of dog is it?  Is it well bred & worth lots of money?  Did you pay over $1,000 for it?<br>  <br>  I can see people having to sell their stock, cows, sheep, pigs & stuff like that but I don't see how they can force you to sell your dog.  If he/she is a high quality dog worth lots of money I'd  tell them it was a mutt not worth a dime.<br>  <br>  I don't think that they can make you sell your dog.  Never been there so I don't know for sure.  God, I hope not.  I wonder if they could make you send children away just because of a bankruptcy.  A friend of mine filed for bankruptcy & she has 3 dogs & 2 horses & they were never mentioned.  They can't take your home, your car, or anything you would use to abtain work.  I really don't think they can take your dog.<br>  <br>  This is what I found on Yahoo answers about bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=Akcm_6gJjL5K.UJErD_oxFvL7BR.;_ylv=3?p=are+animals+considered+assets+when+filing+bankruptcy%3F">http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...</a><br>  <br>  This is the same question I ask when pulling up Yahoo questions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0oGkkKI.qJJmH8B7u.l87UF?p=are+animals+considered+assets+when+filing+bankruptcy%3F&fr=ks-ans&fr2=sfp&iscqry=">http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0oG...</a>|`|YLYAo2zmaa	I doubt with it being a mix that they would even try given the influx of homeless dogs in shelters it would be a stupid move for them. <br>  I simply would not have told them I have a dog. And if they make a visit to your home, would have had someone else keep the dog for a bit.<br>  Now what I would do just in case is say the dog is gone, ran away, died etc..<br>  But like I said and a few others, he isn't papered, is a mix, and has no championships, so it is doubtful that he is an asset.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I think it is doubtful because it really has no value and someone would have to care for it. It is not the same as taking your car or freezing your bank account. Be advised that bankruptcy laws have changed and the courts expect you to work towards restitution.|`|eoOmeeJoaa	I doubt it very much.  There would be way too much trouble involved in reselling your dog not to mention the maintenance and the value would be negligable.|`|cie3oBcXaa	Sorry to hear about your troubles. I wouldn't think that they could take your dog if he isn't a pedigree? I hope things improve for you soon. Take care.|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	I would consider a sheepdog mix a liability rather than an asset (unless he has some unique talent)|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	I wouldn't let no creditor take my dogs.  No way in Hell.  I would just you dog stay with someone else for the time being so there is no way possible of them taking your poor dog.|`|AA11244754	If the dog was a pure breed with a championship MAYBE but a mutt, I don't think so.|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	No it is alive!  :)|`|cp7fjeJhaa	oh wow that would suck, i dont think they can do that, that is awful !!!|`|a162de189aa1c1becbdbb0cd4b7cd67caa	i would say no.  if it were a prized dog that won trophies and blue ribbons and such, then i would say yes.  But just your average pooch that isn't going to make them money shouldn't be a big deal. <br>  give the boy some kissies and huggies for me (hehe) and good luck with the bankruptcy|`|I63TUEr4aa	No, I don't believe you can lose your sheepdog mix. Dogs that get taken are purebreds. Muts from the pound have no value. Alas, just lie and say that your dog is not a purebred even if she/he is. Burn the papers. Whatever it takes. A dog is not an asset. A little white lie to save someone you love won't matter. If she/he a mut, you're safe! Good luck with your financial difficulty. You know, if you take the math portion of a teacher's exam that cooresponds to your state- you can become a math teacher. MATH TEACHERS ARE IN HIGH DEMAND!|`|y4w6ybr3aa	I would say no. I just recently filed for bankruptcy, not sure about the law where you live, but Mass law if you make under 52,000 you do not have to pay back your debitors. Do you have any secured debt? If so, that is the only thing they could take,such as a house or car.Other than that, I find it unlikely that they would try and take your dog.|`|FdcWPp48aa	What value would you put on the dog?  Mix breeds are really no monetary value.  So list it as $0 value and you will have nothing to worry about.  Maybe someone with champions or a business that breeds dogs would have something to worry about, but even then I doubt it.|`|BO28Mn8haa	I was worried about this too with my parents. They have a pretty expensive pure breed yorkie I bought them. I was worried it would be taken away but I doubt it. Just in case, Jasper is under my name and will be in my home until further notice|`|S7x5TBx3aa	omg how sad, ok, it is alive so i don't think they could take it so, hopefully you will still be will you friend, but if it is a champ dog than it may have money value. D=<br>  <br>                                    GOOD LUCK =||`|vGZEo8Dbaa	if for some stupid reason a creditor had perfected a lien against your dog AND chose to collect then yes they could legally take your dog.....but its highly unlikely, in fact it would be ridiculous.|`|0sodtcoKaa	no, your dog is yours and they cannot take it away from you. good luck job hunting. dont give up hope!|`|I5pUxwPbaa	I really dont think they wil take your dog|`|AA10500537	no they wont take your dog.<br>  if so i never heard of it|`|H7DimASYaa	i dont think so|`|HJ3mGLGGaa	as horrible as it is, yes, the can "seize" your dog as if it is an object. if it has no market value, they can still seize it. the dog will not be taken from you before you car, electronics, etc are taken away, but it is not against the law. by law, pets are classified as objects. if your dog is hit by a drunk driver, you can not collect "pain and suffering" money, which you would be able to collect if your child was hit by a car. to the law, if your dog is hit by the car, it is equal to the car running over your cellphone.|`|IGXE3aDraa	I don't think they would take your dog because he is a mix. for example if he was a show dog with papers and did really well in dog shows he would have a price value to the dog and could be sold. luckily you dog is a mix, and doesn't have that monitory value the banks are looking for. sorry about your financial stuff, I understand I just graduated and can't find a job in my field either. good luck.<br>  <br>  if they actually tried it the dog should "run away" to a friends house or something.|`|s76aC4G8aa	No they won't take your dog, they would take your home or your car before they'd ever take your dog, a sheepdog mix is not a dog of value and he has no market value.<br>  <br>  If you have a car that is worth less than you owe, they won't make you sell it, since the primary lien holder would be the first one paid.  My car wasn't worth anything only $1500 and I had homesteaded my house so they couldn't touch it, I had nothing of value, I even had to list my furniture and my TV and after a few years they really aren't worth anything.  When I filed bankruptcy they took a look at everything and decided that it wasn't worth anything and considered me bankrupt.  I owed nothing, I gave up nothing, in fact they listed my car but I did not include my home or my car or one credit card in the bankruptcy only the major credit cards that I was falling behind on and a debt of my ex boyfriends when he defaulted on a car loan I stupidly signed on.  I lost nothing in the bankruptcy I walked away owing nothing, keeping my car and home and my two cats.<br>  <br>  So no, I seriously doubt they would take your dog, he's not worth anything to them sorry.
RFM2Cb1Zaa	A running helps to hold their head down so they can't raise it too high or chuck it up and down a lot when schooling or jumping - however your mare is only young and undeveloped so training aids probably aren't best at that stage because it forces their head into a certain position. In time her balance will get better and she won't raise her head so I wouldn't recommend it until she's a bit older and you definitely tell its what right for her.<br>  I personally don't like martingales because the horse can;t find their natural head carriage but that's just my opinion.|`|RloOJ43haa	I also agree with Just Google It.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I couldn't have said it any better than Sasha.  I too second the opinion that your girl is holding her head high simply because she's young, inexperienced and unbalanced.  I wouldn't use one at all on her.  She may develop improper head carriage or develop the wrong muscles wearing one all the time.  When she has improved her condition and her balance and she has more experience under her belt, I'd be willing <br>  to bet that her neck and head will go down where they're supposed to.  <br>  <br>  It's often the continual use of tie downs and martingales that cause long term problems for some people and their horses.  I'd steer clear of them for a young horse, but that's just me.|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	I recommend a german martingale.  I use one everyday and LOVE it.  <br>  <br>  The german martingale works very similarly to draw reins (my trainer says it is like draw reins for dummies)  <br>  <br>  A german martingale is a strap of leather around the horse's neck, a strap connected to the girth and two split pieces that go through the bit and connect to rings on the bit.  This causes any rein pressure to also bring your horse's head down.  If your horse particularly raises his or her head when you use your reins I highly reccomend the german martingale.<br>  <br>  How it works:  When you pull on your reins, a horse's natural reaction is to pull their head up.  In a german martingale, it pulls their head down and back, causing a proper headset as you ask for turns, transitions etc.  There are 3 or 4 rings on german martingale reins and each determine how far down you want your horse's head to be pulled, if it is set on the loosest ring, his head will be pulled down only if it is higher than that ring allows (thus preventing you from pulling his head down too far and causing pain or agitation)<br>  <br>  It does not lock his or her head in place, it gives and takes slack as you use your reins.<br>  <br>  A running martingale is very similar but mainly adds leverage on the reins and does not really pull his head down and in proper position as a german martingale.|`|3jSWf96Eaa	i completely agree with just google it... martingales tend to develop the wrong muscles in the wrong places, and is just the easy way out of developing those muscles and teaching the horse to carry itself properly on its own. it may take a while but it is possible. i have an ott TB and he was kept on a really short martingale for soooo long. but i just worked with him and now he travels so nice and round without any contraptions. =)
AoSeHXeQaa	"Food and Feeding: The Barred Owl has an extremely varied diet composed mostly of small mammals, especially small rodents, along with a good percentage of birds. Prey also includes arthropods, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. Birds up to the size of grouse, domestic foul, pheasant, partridge and even smaller owls (up to and including records of Long-eared Owls) will be taken. Mammals taken include voles, mice, shrews, squirrels, wood rats, rabbits, opossums, chipmunks, hares and bats are commonly taken. Other prey includes snakes, frogs, lizards, salamanders, mollusks, insects, and has also known to have mastered fishing. The Barred Owl is clearly an opportunistic forager taking whatever is available to them and within their power to overwhelm."<br>  <br>  That sounds like he could take a small dog, to me.  Even if the owl could not take your dog, he might injure him.  I wouldnt leave your dog outside by himself.|`|Jj6lJDajaa	Yes it can but only if the owl feels targeted. say if the dog barked at the owl the owl may get wary and might attack. But owls only come out at night.|`|f2GFX5B2aa	Yes it can. Small dogs and cats are always falling prey to owls and coyotes where I'm at, especially at night and early mornings. Please take care of your poochy!|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Owls do NOT "only come out at night"<br>  <br>  They are hunters, and if they can snatch something up, they will.<br>  <br>  If a bird of prey can lift your dog off of the ground chances are it could be a target but I seriously doubt a 12 lb dog has anything to worry about|`|FdcWPp48aa	Owls are predators.  It can catch and kill a rabbit, so yes it could catch and kill your little dog.  Keep your dog indoors with you and no worries.<br>  <br>  ADD:  My co-workers chihuahua dissappeared one day and we are pretty sure a hawk took it.  The dog had access to a doggie door and could go in and out as it wished.  That was a bad decision if you ask me.
ZuFVHsRpaa	There is some debate about whether the betta fish needs or would prefer more room, but they certainly can live in small aquariums. Betta fish come in many varieties. There are regular bettas, crown tail bettas, twin tail bettas, and more. There are show bettas and bettas that are caught in the wild and of great value because they refresh the betta gene pool. Betta fish have been found to live for up to three years in the right conditions, but few in home aquariums will live anywhere near this long. You may have heard betta fish referred to as "Siamese Fighting Fish." This is because male bettas are extremely aggresive towards one another and will fight. They have been known to flare up upon seeing their own reflections so as to intimidate what they perceive as another betta. Female betta fish are not quite that aggressive towards each other, though it is recommended that there be many hiding places inside a tank if several female betta fish are to be kept together. Keeping two male betta fish together will almost certainly result in one dying.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Does it happen when the room itself is rather dark, yet his light is on? Mine would do this closer to the evening when his light was the brightest thing in my room. Somehow, he was able to see his reflection on his side of the glass.|`|eyKx05LKaa	He is probably seeing his reflection in the glass, and thinks it's another male betta, which will make him want to fight.  Male Betta's flare out their gills when they are in attack mode.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	He is just seeing his reflection in the glass.|`|SNGYw6oZaa	My bettas always attack the glass when I walk anywhere near them.  He may be reacting to your presence and there won't be a whole lot you can do about it.  I don't think he can kill himself by knocking into the glass.|`|5XnypZkVaa	He probably sees his reflection in the glass.|`|yMS9wgfWaa	maybe its mental|`|F8m1VaoYaa	i can only say that he must be able to see his reflextion on the glass ,thinking its another betta so he thinks hes attacking another betta honestly dont know what you can do to stop it|`|IrdZKYT3aa	He's getting into his sexually mature months, more than likely he's started seeing his reflection in the glass and has decided it's a rival male.  Male betta's can become desensitized to the sight of another male if it's consistent enough.  So hopefully he'll stop attacking himself.<br>  Best of Luck!
