Ok i know this from a friend of mine.When you see him you become a fan of his instantly.He is charming and most girls get mad about him.So he explained to me that : When people know less details about you, you appear very interesting to them and they start liking you.When they dont know anything about ur life they think that you are almost perfect.When you are saying a joke for example only once a day, all people are listening to u with a desire because they are not always listening to you.When you are calling ur friends rarely, they very happy and the feel blessed to have u calling them.He is always being very kind to all people and they feel glad to do him a favour, because they think very high of him.As a summary "Rare things value higher" Do you think that this is a good point ?A good way of life ?

But also not always okay to use "African American" because not all are from Africa?      Like, when I refer to someone who is Spanish, I can say Hispanic or Latina.   And I feel like saying "white" is fine, considering that most American's nowadays don't have much knowledge of their heritage and couldn't really care.      So what's the correct term?      Please, I don't mean any disrespect or offense. I'm trying to educate myself.

"Even from his awkward position, he could see that she was extraordinary- tall as a hickory sapling, with arms as big as a keelboat tiller's."      And this hyperbole?

20090226131447AAe83oR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can one be a Christian and yet believe in free will? Please read entire question before answering.?	This question is not meant to be offensive and should not be taken as such. It is merely a serious attempt to reconcile these two seemingly conflicting beliefs:      Most Christian denominations preach that humans possess free will, yet at the same time preach eternal damnation for disbelief and many other transgressions.       According to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language "Free will" is defined as:   "1. free and independent choice; voluntary decision" &   "2. the doctrine that the conduct of human beings expresses personal choice and is not simply determined by physical or divine forces"   According to the same dictionary "Eternal" is defined as:   "1. without beginning or end; lasing forever; always existing" &   "2. perpetual; ceaseless; endless"   and "Damnation" is defined theologically as:   "3. condemnation to eternal punishment as a consequence of sin"      These two ideas: "free will" and "eternal damnation" seem completely at odds with one another. Free will is voluntary, but the promise of eternal damnation is severe coercion. It compels one into behaving in an involuntary way via intimidation. When one is presented with the "choice" between behaving/thinking in a particular way on the one hand, and intolerable emotional and/or physical punishment that lasts forever and ever without end on the other, then the entire concept of choice is taken out of the equation. One is unable to exercise free will under such a condition simply out of self preservation. No sane person would want to endure interminable, unbearable punishment. So there would actually be no room for the exercise of free will in such a situation. One's freedom to choose would be circumvented by the innate deisre to avoid such horrible consequences. In such a case as eternal damnation by God for disbelief or sin, one's decision would be "determined by a divine force" and thus the antithesis of free will  (see "free will" definition 2 above).      Of course anyone may respond to this question - nonbelievers and believers in any religion alike. I only ask that the responses be thoughtful and serious. No rants please. I have based my question and my expansion upon this question on reason, logic, and rational thought. I respectfully ask that any and all respodents do the same.         Once again, please be sure to have read everything above before answering. Thank you.

If there is no God, how can you all account for the earth’s breathable air and that this is the only planet that has the exact air we need? If there is no God how do you account for the positions of the stars, some of the interesting and weird looking animals and even us humans? What gave us souls, feelings, and the idea to invent something? How do you explain the miracles that are done with just a touch of a hand or with the phrase, “In the name of Jesus Christ, you are healed.”? How do you explain the wonders of the earth? If God isn’t real, then explain why some atheists have agreed that there is a God? God was not created. He was, is, and will always be. Why can’t you all accept that there is a God? It doesn’t make any sense that evolution, two stars colliding together, and the big bang theory created all of this.

I want more mature and older people to answer, i dont want no immature answers or comments. I am going through something right now, i just dont know what to do or how to take it. I have a friend that i went to high school with that now lives on the third floor of my apartments. Over the past 6 months her and i have been hanging out all the time. The thing is that i have a boyfriend of 6 years and a baby and she has the same thing going for her too. But within this past week her and i have gotten very close to one another. WE always want to be together...and i mean always! She will call me at work, and wed be talking all day! She just tells me how sexy i am, and how much we wants me home already, and she wants me, etc. The conversation of her being gay tends to come up all the time. Right now she is getting tired of her boyfriend, becasue of the way he treats her! She has been thinking of going back to girls. She said she was a whole lot happier and funnier when she was gay.....and plus her liking girls never faded.  So, her and i have been talking on the phone non stop, and i can see that she flirts with me! I do flirt with her, alot, because i like the attention. But it also gets me tinglly in my stomach.  I get butterflies around her now! Its just the wierdest feeling. I have always been the type to look at a girl and say things about her like, shes pretty, or shes hott or something like that. But i just dont know what to do! Am i or not? Also, her and i kissed the other day just to try it, and i loved it.  She knew where to kiss and touch me on all the right places.  We never did anything else, but its just that ive been all GAY! I dont know what to do, can anyone help!!!
20090226132120AAtcLHy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians:  Doesn't society make sinners?  How are humans inherently sinful in nature?	If someone was abandoned in the wilderness shortly after learning how to walk and talk, how could they sin?  They have nobody to lie to, no one to have sex with, they can't talk back to their parents or judge or be greedy (because they have nothing).  They can't have pride (no mirrors) or lust (no one around) or sloth (they have to work all the time in the wilderness or they'd die).  And so on.      Also, why would anyone want to be inherently sinful?  Why would you want to believe that all humans are naturally bad, and that it's only through Jesus that humans can be saved?  Wouldn't it make more sense that all humans are naturally good, except for when they are corrupted by society?

20090226132158AAvAXWR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the deal with the word "belief"?	It drives me nuts the way people use this word and think that it somehow changes and molds reality to whatever they want it to be.   When did we, as seemingly intelligent human beings, begin to think that we were cable of changing the nature of reality with only the power of our own thoughts?      If I want to believe that I'm a watermelon, can I make it so with nothing more than the power of my "belief"?   If I want it bad enough, can my conviction actually twist reality and turn me into one just because I believe it?   What if I want to turn all of you into watermelons as well, will the sheer force of my will and desire be enough to get the job done, despite what you may all "believe"?      There is an absolute truth which exists outside of our opinions and perception, outside of our "beliefs".   I can't turn myself into a watermelon just by believing I am one. It doesn't work that way.   I can't make the theory of gravity stop working just because I "believe" that it doesn't work.   If I step off of a ten story building without a big airbag at the bottom, I'm going to go splat, no matter what I think.      Why do religious people think that they can actually change the nature of reality simply by "believing" that something that they want to be true IS actually true?   What is it that makes them think that the laws of the universe can be bypassed simply by their wishing for it to be so?      What is so hard to understand about the fact that things are the way they are regardless of our perceptions, opinions, wishes, or "beliefs"?

He always compliments me and calls me sweet names. I try to tell him not to do so because its not halal because I'm not married to him. He wants to get married to me. I guess at first I wasn't that interested in him but now I feel I've started to fall for him. I want to talk to my parents about this but I have no idea how to tell them. The guy who wants to marry me asked if I want him to ring my father up and talk about this, but I said no because that would be very embarassing for me because it would come as a great shock to my father. I havn't given that guy a yes or no answer yet.      With that being said, I was wondering whether I should say yes or no. His job isn't that great and its a bit of an inconvenient time right now because I'm in my first year of university and so its going to be two more years till I graduate. So I doubt he would relocate near my university because he works in a town many miles away. I'm very confused and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel I can't trust my own decision on this because I'm only 19 and I know nothing about relationships and it is going to be like TORTURE for me to tell my parents and I really don't want to go through that. On the other hand, the guy who proposed to me is very very sweet, caring practicing Muslim and he has a great personality. I feel lost, I just don't know what I should do. Should I just call it off?
20090429054044AAgpm3h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To those who answer hypothetical questions with "Oh, God would NEVER do that"...?	...How the hell would YOU know?      Didn't God "repent" (i.e.; change his mind) about having made humanity when he decided to wipe them all out in a worldwide deluge?  And again, when he realized that doing so was pointless and that even his beloved Noah was weak and corrupt at his core?      Didn't Allah (if you're a Muslim) change his mind when Muhammad talked him down from requiring fifty prayers a day to just five?      Didn't God himself instigate the biggest game-changer of all, when he replaced the old Covenant with Abraham with a new one via the sacrifice of Jesus?      Assuming your scripture can be taken at face value, we've just established that your God can and does change his mind, no matter which Abrahamic god you might believe in...isn't it the height of presumption and arrogance to claim to KNOW what your God's future mind will be?      Isn't it time to admit that you're just projecting your own inner voice -- both the good and the bad -- onto your God?

Let's start with the fact that I have a huge amount of respect for anyone that is willing to put their life on the line in defense of another.      My question is this, why shouldn't people be responsible for protecting themselves?      I am neither a thug nor a convicted felon. I work extremely hard to get everything that my family and I have, so I am in no way looking to victimize anyone whatsoever, and still I am no respecter of the law. I respect God, but not the law due to the fact that it is so corrupt.      I would also like to point out that the police cannot help you until you are already a victim.      I have never called for police assistance and I never will. I know what it is to put my life on the line at work and have survived more than most here would believe...that is why I ask, why is it my responsibility to spend my tax dollars protecting people that cannot or will not protect themselves?

We had a bonnet hair dryer, wasn't good for long hair, and I remember going outside during the warm months and hanging my head down and brushing it until it was dry. In the cooler months I either let it dry on its own or turned on the big box fan we had and dried it quicker.  I am thinking of this, it is already 80 degrees at lunchtime and just dried my hair outside while hanging my head down. Thought it was wonderful the first time I got to buy a blow-dryer.

20090226103654AA8rzyf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	Is anyone still wondering about the $250.00 stimulus checks?	I did a little search and went to SSA’s website (BTW, you should bookmark this site for further information) where found the following information about the time frame:      President Obama recently signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This act provides for the one-time payment of $250 to individuals who get Supplemental Security Income or Social Security benefits.      We expect everyone who is entitled to a payment to receive it by late May 2009. No action is required on your part.      We are currently working on the details regarding how we will issue over 60 million one-time payments to our beneficiaries.      When more information becomes available, we will promptly post it here. Please bookmark this site and check back regularly. Thank you.      So basically, SSI recipients can expect to receive the payment by early June if the payments are to be sent out by late May. In addition, according to SSA, for those who are currently receiving their benefits by check, then the one-time payment will also come in as a check in the mail. If you get your benefits via direct deposit, then you will have $250 direct-deposited into your bank, another reason why you should use direct deposit.

20090226105236AAzyudD	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	About Judaism and vampires and werewolves oh my!?	Okay, so, this comes from watching too much Being Human today (which I think is a fantastic show, but)      Okay, so, in the show, there's a Jewish werewolf named George. He's lapsed practcing because he's fairly sure being a werewolf would be frowned upon, but he always wears his Star of David when he's human.      They were having this big fight with a bunch of vampires, trying to save their one (vampire) friend, and George's Star of David made Seth, the one annoying vampire, jump back and hiss, like it burned him. BUT, Mitchell, the vampire friend, always looks after the Star of David while George is a wolf.       So my question is, theoretically, if vampires had/have souls (I'm not sure if they do or not in the show) would a Jew who was turned into a vampire, still be a Jew, and therefore only affected by Jewish holy objects? 'Cause the only way I can figure out Seth being effected by the Star of David, and not Mitchell would be because Seth is (or was) Jewish.

Basically, These boys were being racist to my friend they called her a Chinese Hoe, Chinese Cow, Kung Fu Pandas wife, Jackie Chan wannabe and she's actually not CHINESE shes happens to be  MUSLIM with very fair skin, she doesn't even look chinese. We told the teacher because he obviously heard them and all he did was blank us out and then when we asked again he wrote the boys names down AND ours too when we did nothing wrong.   At the end of the day the 6 of us had to stay behind and he shouted at me and my two mates not the boys Surprise surprise. I asked him why he was being so sexist and all he did was ask for my name. My friend told him what happened and he asked the boys if it was true and of course they said no, And he said well I know who I believe right now girls. He was basically saying we were lieing and we wanted the boys to get into trouble. And now the 6 of us have to report to our head of year tomorrow at 1.05 and get it sorted out, All I'm saying is shouldn't he have had a little more control over everyone and believed us and should he have turned a cold shoulder on us by '' not '' hearing the comments.?   Was this right/wrong? explain why please & thanks.

She has done so many things over the past that none of her close friends really speak to her anymore just on occasion. I myself from time to time talk to her but she knows that we can never be friends again.

I KNOW THIS IS LONG - PLS SPEED - READ - NEED UR HELP   There is a girl in my class who said some pretty nasty things about my skin colour at the begining of the term, and about being mixed.      She also stares at me in class, sometimes it is a hard stare unbliking - other times she screws her face up at me and stares - but she definetly stares --- I have never seen anything like it in all my days, It is weird and a bit scary.      She has always been extremely rude and sarcastic and has made bitchy comments about how I dress / what I wear.     She ignores me and excludes me from conversations and talks about me behind my back to the boys in the class. The boys also have begun saying nasty things about me / laughing at me. She is also bitching about me to another girl in the class - and she and her ***** about me  too. We had to work in a group in class, it was the racist girl, her side kick, and myself. I was mid sentene and the pair of them just laughed at me constrantly, and were cracking up the whole way through whilst i was trying to do the task.      I would like my friends to be supportive and reassure me in private that I'm ok, and that shes just being ignorant - but they remain cold and silent.      Today, the racist girl was staring at me again during lectures. She was on the front row, and I was 7 rows behind her to the side. She turnes around and started staring at me. The first time, I thiught - whatever - shes been doing this the whole year. The second time, I was like what the ****? I tirned to my really good friend next to me and said "Shes always staringf at me - its so ******* weird and annoying" My friend started defending her! and saying she just staring past you (she wasnt - she turned around and looked directly at me, she does this all the time) - i said she does this in class - she continude to argue back with me!!!! - This is the second time this "friend" has failed to back me up, - she also can never be happy for me when i get good grades / have higher aspirations or goals.         - I would like my firend to be more supportive, Im only asking here to be more reassuiring when things like this happen. To just say you are ok, shes just a idiot forget her - but she cant even do that!!! - For the record, I have my friends back all the time - I have been supportive and loyal during her own personal disputes with others.      I can understand my friend wanting to stay neutral and not get involved, I really do. However - by standing up for this other girl, making excuses for her, and implying im imaginibg it (e.g her staring) - they are picking her over me and not remaining neutral at all.      My questions are:      1. What do i do?   2. Is she really my friend?    3. How do i cope with this horrible girl?   4. Any other comments are much needed!      Thankyou

20090226134734AAb8lkg	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: What is Kuff?	This is a book written against Shias by Wahhabis        Sawaiqh al Muhriqa page 95 by Ibn Hajar al Makki      "A distinguishing feature of Rasulullah (s) is that he is the father of Fatima's descendants. The descendants of Fatima are his children. For a man or woman, marriage based on kuff (equivalent) is a necessity. A kuff for the descendants of Fatima is compulsory; a pious Hashmi cannot marry a non Hashmi".      Mufti Ghulam Rasul expands on this matter further, relying on the fatwas of classical Sunni Ulema in his book Hasab aur Nasab Volume 2 pages 188-190:      "Marriage between a Sayyid woman and a non Sayyid man is batil (false) on the basis that Nikah to a non kuff (equivalent) is not permitted. When the cornerstone of marriage is kuff then the marriage between a Sayyid female and non Sayyid man cannot be achieved since Sayyid women are the descendants of Rasulullah (s), and hence their equivalents can only be another one of Rasulullah's descendants. This was the opinion of Allamah Yusuf Nabhani (d. 1350 Hijri) in al Sharaf al Muhbad page 39.      Al Hafidh Jalaladeen Suyuti stated in Khasais al Kubra that 'One of the distinctions of the descendants of Rasulullah (s) is that no one else can be their kuff. Ibn Hajr al Makki (d. 974 Hijri) states 'One distinction of Rasulullah (s) is that his daughter's descendants are linked to him. As no one is the kuff to Rasulullah (s) the only kuff to his descendants can be those from his daughters lineage, which is why even one of Abbaside lineage cannot be the kuff of a female descendant of Fatima, despite the fact that they are both of Hashmi descent (Fatawi Kabeera Volume 4 page 97)'. He also stated in Sawiqh al Muhriqa page 234 that 'Our scholars have concluded that these traditions serve as proof that a distinguishing feature of Rasulullah (s) is that he is the father of Fatima's descendants, their kuff is linked to him?to that point a pious (non Sayyid) Hashmi cannot be the kuff of his descendants. Other than Rasulullah (s)'s lineage the lineage of ALL other daughters is linked to their fathers, not their mothers'.      When no one can be counted as the kuff of Rasulullah's descendants then the Nikah of a Sayyidah to a non-kuff, does not meet the criterion of a valid Nikah. Hadhrath 'Umar stated 'I prohibit women marrying their non-kuff. Imam Muhammad narrates in al Thashar from Imam Abu Hanifah that 'I am opposed to a woman of good lineage marrying one that is not her kuff.' Shah Waliyullah also cited these words of 'Umar in Hujjul Balagha, Volume 2, page 94, and added:      'In light of these traditions there are no grounds to conclude that that the concept of kuff is unproven. The character of all manner of people is all linked to their kuff? people's kuff differs, the Shari'a does not ignore such matters, which is why 'Umar prohibited women from marrying those that were not their kuff?"      Marriage needs to be conducted on the basis of one's kuff. If a non Sayyid woman chooses to marry a non-kuff of her own accord then the foundation of that marriage is false. Allamah Abdul Rahman Hazarvi stated in Bagheeyatathul Mishtur Shahdeen, page 94:      'If a pious Sayyid woman declares marriage to a non Sayyid, I do not deem such a marriage to be correct, even if the wali and the Sayyid woman are happy since marriage can only be conducted on the basis of kuff.'      The marriage between a Sayyid woman and a non Sayyid man in all circumstances is unacceptable, since this constitutes disrespect of Ahl'ul bayt, and this is not permissible under the Shari'a, on the contrary it is binding upon us to afford them respect and protection."    Hasab aur Nasab Volume 2 pages 188-189    Hasab aur Nasab Volume 2 pages 190      "Allamah Shahrani (d. 973 Hijri) stated:      'No one can be the kuff of the Ahl'ul bayt when it comes to marriage. Ahl incorporates all the descendants of Rasulullah (s) until the Day of Judgement [Kushuf al Ghimma Volume 2 page 42]?.'      So when they have no kuff until the Day of Judgement, if a Sayyida woman marries with a non kuff, this marriage is devoid of kuff, and is not acceptable. That is why the Ulema have issued edicts concerning Sayyids.      The Shaafi Ulema have stated that the descendents of Sayyida Fatima are linked to Rasulullah (s) they share one another's characteristics and rules of kuff apply to them. In marriage they both are kuff of one another. If the girl is Sayyid and the boy is not then a Nikah cannot take place, since a non Sayyid is not the kuff of a Sayyid woman. This is because the Sayyida woman is linked to Rasulullah (s) whilst the non Sayyid male is not. The closeness to Rasulullah (s) is not shared by both?.      That is why Allamah Sayyid Shahabadeen in 'Rashafath al Sari, page 74' stated:      'Whether we are Hasani or Husayni in ancestry we only marry our daughters with those of a pious noble lineage, it is not permissible for us to marry them to a non-Sayyid.'      Mehr 'Ali Shah (ra) stated that the Nikah (marriage contract) between a Sayy

After thinking about it and asking myself some questions.      Sure, you can say that you think the guilty should be punished, but let's say you were personally on a jury and had to decide whether someone deserves to live or die (lets say the person was guilty)      Could you put someone to death?      Lets go one step further and say they wanted you to be the executioner, and kill the person yourself.       Since you're pro-death penalty, would you have any problems doing it? (the criminal was found guilty...)         I asked myself these questions and found that I could never take a human life myself, or sentence someone to death for that matter. And I don't like the "it's morally wrong if I do it, but okay if someone else does..." idea.      Maybe it's just me.

So Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while.     11 As he was about to enter Egypt, he spoke to his wife Sarai. He said, "I know what a beautiful woman you are. 12 The people of Egypt will see you. They will say, 'This is his wife.' And they will kill me. But they will let you live. 13 Say you are my sister. Then I'll be treated well because of you. My life will be spared because of you."     14 Abram arrived in Egypt. The people of Egypt saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman. 15 When Pharaoh's officials saw her, they bragged to Pharaoh about her. Sarai was taken into his palace.     16 Pharaoh treated Abram well because of her. So Abram gained more sheep and cattle. He also got more male and female donkeys. And he gained more male and female servants and some camels.     17 But the Lord sent terrible sicknesses on Pharaoh and everyone in his palace. He did it because of Abram's wife Sarai.     18 So Pharaoh sent for Abram. "What have you done to me?" he said. "Why didn't you tell me she was your wife? 19 Why did you say, 'She's my sister'? That's why I took her to be my wife. Now then, here's your wife. Take her and go!"     20 Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men. They sent him on his way. He left with his wife and everything he had.

20090226134014AAeZHAb	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Profile: Dreams                  ?	Dreams are broken into three parts according to Hadiths:       Ru'yaah - Good dreams.      Hulum - Bad dreams.      Dreams from one's self.      Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Prophet Muhammad (Saw) said, "There are three types of dreams: a righteous dream which is glad tidings from Allah, the dream which causes sadness is from the Shaaytan, and a dream from the ramblings of the mind. (Related by Muslim)       The true dreams are from  Allah (Swt), as Prophet Muhammad (Saw) said, "True dreams are from Allah, and bad dreams are from Shaaytan." (related by Al-Bukhari)       True dreams are more likely to be seen by those who are truthful in their lives as Prophet Muhammad (Saw) said, "Those of you with the truest dreams will be those who are most truthful in speech." (related by Muslim)       Prophet Muhammad (Saw)  said, "Indeed the worst of lies is that of a person who falsely claims to have dreams." (related by Al-Bukhari)       You may share your good dreams with those you like as Prophet Muhammad (Saw) said, "If one sees a good dream, let him expect good, and not tell it except to those he likes (someone pious, honest, trustworthy)." (related by Muslim)      An example of the above Hadith is Prophet Yaqoob (Pbuh) telling his son, Yusuf (Pbuh) concerning his dream about eleven stars and the sun and the moon prostrating to him: "He said, "O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers lest they arrange a plot against you. Verily! Satan is to man an open enemy." (Surah Yusuf 12:5)       We know the brothers of Yusuf were jealous of him, therefore telling them the dream only served to increase their jealousy.  So it is important that a good dream only be shared with trustworthy people who do not envy.      Prophet Muhammad (Saw) also told us, "Nothing is left of Prophethood except glad tidings." Those with him asked, "What are glad tidings?" He replied, "Good dreams." (related by Al-Bukhari)       -God bless.

20090226140009AAliDpo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I don't want to be apart of the watchtower anymore!!?	I'm gonna try and explain this.      My Dad was born a JW and my mom converted from a Pentecostal Church when they started dating. They got married and had me. When I was 2 my mom decided not to go any more because she realized that they did not have the truth. My dad and her decided to stay married. When I was 4, my mom was in a car accident and needed blood. She concented and had 4 blood transufions. Sh asked the doctors not to tell my dad until the procedure was done, that way he counld't interfere.   When he found out, he told the elders and the elders advised him to get a divorce. He did. My mom moved back to her hometown and my dad and me stayed in the town. My mom wanted to take me with her but the elders and my dad wanted me to stay because if I went with my mom I would be going to a Pentecostal Church and that was considered false religion. So my dad got his way and I stayed with him.   2 years later he remarried a girl named Sadie. She was a full time pioneer. She didn't have a job, all she did was witness. She and my dad had three childern, all girls. Fast Forward to now. About a year ago I deciced that Jehovah's Witnesses were wrong and what the watchtower teaches was wrong. On my twice a week phone calls with my mom (my dad let me talk to her on Tuesdays and Thursdays) I told my mom that I wanted to come live with her. She said that was fine but I would have to get it threw the courts. Well I cound't. So I decided to run to my moms house. I had a best friend that was going on a vaction to were my mom lived and I got a ride. I was there 3 days and my dad come to get me and dragged me back. So I caused a lot of trouble for my dad. And when we went back to the judge he asked what I wanted.I told him my story and said I wanted to live with my mom. And my dad said whatever fine cause he didn't want any more trouble with me.         SO HERE"S THE PROBLEM:   I can't move until school's over. That's 4 months from now. In the mean time things at my house are very uncomfertble. My dad dosen't talk to me very much, only if he has to, and Sadie says almost nothing. I'm not aloud to ask for rides or anything else, nor money. If I want it I have to find a way myself. A girl at the church I've been going to also goes to my school. Her mom said that if I wanted, I could stay with them, rent free until I move down with my mom. At this piont I don't think my dad cares. The only reason why he would say know is cause once a week he has three girls my age come from the Kingdom Hall and share the bible with me. Not interested. So, should I take the offer or put up with it for a little while longer?
20090226134013AAfMcGT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, which is a worse sin: Being a homosexual or having a hateful heart?	I’m a Christian, but I have seen a lot of Christians (or those who claim to be) posting hateful questions (rants) against gays. Actually, I’ve witnessed this kind of thing in person, too. Once I visited a church and heard the preacher refer to gays as “f@ggots”. This didn’t sit well with me at all. It seems impossible to call another fellow human being a f@ggot without any malice in your heart.      So this has me wondering, are Christians acting in genuine love when they focus on and berate another individual for their sexual orientation?

I saw two young girls, giggling,   Comparing carrots to I don't know what.   A man passes me in a hurry,   Lines of concentration on his brow,   Swirls of anxiety in his wake,   While a silver haired old lady   Peruses the wine labels, half smiling.   I wonder if she's planning a romantic dinner.   Two small children pass in a cloud of laughs,   Ignoring the cries of a harried mother   And hiding round the corner of the bread rolls.   Waiting breathlessly, wide eyed, grinning.   A pair of teenagers lounge studiously,   Studying the CD racks with one eye   And a couple of girls with the other,   Exuding nonchalance and pheremones.   People in shop uniforms bustle,   Filling shelves, sweeping, giving directions   With fixed grins, genuine grins, warm smiles,   An occasional grimace.   White, black, brown, yellow,   They're all here, and then gone again,   Replaced minute by minute.   Where do they come from?   Where do they go?   What do they do, think, want, dislike?   How many are saints, sinners, lunatics?   Are any of them aware of me? Each other?   Oh, my line is moving,   Got to go.

20090226133426AAXURQn	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Would asking guests not to waste food be rude?	Before the question, here's background: I'm Japanese and one VERY valued moral ethic for us is to thank your food and never, ever, waste food.    To reasons. Most people until the last generation have experienced what true hunger and famine is like (this isn't like going a day or two without food-- I mean like having nothing to eat but dry grass and stuff for years). Even today there are people around the world are starving. Don't you think you're fortunate? People aren't ever thankful of what they have until they lose it...   Reason two. Food equals lots of labor. People to grow the food. Prepare or cook the food. Serve the food. A ton of work goes into simply creating food. Rice-- a staple in Japanese diet-- is extreme labor on the farmer's part. Who is unthankful enough to just toss that away?      Main question here:   Every single (except for exactly two) caucasian guests we've had waste their food. They don't even say "Thank you for the food" (except for the 2 very polite gentlemen just mentioned). Okay, I won't force them to say that, but even for the 16-year-old girl standing nearby it's irritating to see people take more than they can eat so they have some left to toss in the garbage. I won't say anything outside my house. I don't want to force people to eat more than they can.  Just don't take more than they can eat, if they aren't planning to take food home to have as leftovers. If they want more, they're very welcome to take seconds.  All I want to do is politely ASK: "Can you please do not take more than you think you can eat or want to take home?  We hate to waste food.  If you need seconds you're more than welcome."      Would that be rude to ask of my guests in my home?   And also, if you're the type of person who tosses leftovers, WHY do you do that??? I want to know!!

I went to an intensive outpatient program from March to May of last year everyday after school. I met so many amazing people who were similar to me in a few ways, whereas before meeting them, not a lot of people understood me. I like to talk about my feelings, but I never get to. They listen to me because they were supposed to at first, but eventually, they chose to.    I told them about an oration I gave on gay activism. I told them how I gave it my all and still didn't make it to the finals. They inspired me to try again. They told me at the assembly where the finals were being given, I should ask a teacher if I could give my speech. I did and she let me.   Being in IOP, I was the happiest I'd ever been my whole life. Sometimes I wish I could go back, but the same people that were there when I was wouldn't be anymore.

20090226133655AAD97VD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Evolution, fact or fiction?	Evolution is proven . . . PROVEN!       Therefore it's fact, and to say you don't believe in it is like not believing in gravity or particles or anything!      And the fact that the 'all-knowing' God or these prophets never thought to mention it in the Bible, doesn't that just prove that religion is bogus? I mean believe in evolution or not- it's fact, whether that abides by your religion or not.       The very fact the human race has progressed through time- in terms of technology, physicality etc. is just proof that we are evolving intellectually as well as in the way we look.      Animals are adapted to their environment.      Since this seems clear as day to me, why do some people still choose not to believe it?

20090226135816AAjIw81	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spare the Rod, Spoil the Child?	While many people say that this phrase is biblical, and use it to justify spanking their children, it actually originated from a raunchy satirical poem by Samuel Butler called Hudibras.  In it, rod had an obvious double meaning and whipping was an activity enjoyed by consenting adults.      What is your reaction?
20090226135907AAcJFuL	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What ever happened to "attitude", and when did it die?	I'm not talking about arrogance here, but a degree of edge for lack of a better term.  Perhaps one could say it's the confidence to be a bit different, showing some "sass" or "moxy" or whatever one wants to call it.  So when did this finally die?  What killed it?        I'm having trouble putting my finger on *it*, but it feels like our society has become very "safe", as in boring, as in everyone had better look and say exactly what the crowd thinks.       This is admittedly a very narrow example, but I'll offer it because it's what got me thinking about this: my boyfriend has, for the past few years, embraced wearing leather pants.  Before everyone rolls their eyes, let me say that he's not: gay, a drug dealer, German, a biker, a pimp, a rockstar [or wannabe] or any combination of those.  What he is, is someone who likes to give life a little nudge; to be a bit outside of the norm in a way that's essentially harmless.  Plus, he likes the comfort of leather pants.  I wear them too, so I can attest to that.        Anyway, it seems that even though he has the, as his best friend says, "the stones" to wear his leather pants, many people don't recognize the element of "stones" or "moxy" involved.  They just assume he missed the episode of Friends or [insert stereotype here].        By the way, I asked him if I could use this example, and he said "cool, go for it"      Ideas??

"While religious moderates don't fly planes into buildings, or organize their lives around apocalyptic prophecy, they refuse to deeply question the preposterous ideas of those who do. Moderates neither submit to the real demands of scripture nor draw fully honest inferences from the growing testimony of science. In attempting to find a middle ground between religious dogmatism and intellectual honesty, it seems to me that religious moderates betray faith and reason equally."~Sam Harris      Why is this better? Aren't the moderates just, as he says, supporting the paradigm that allows for the extremists?

Now one of our papers writes that members of the "Westboro Baptist Church" will come over here to "disturb the funeral" because they think the aircrash is a punishment of God.      What is this Westboro Baptist Church? Does it have many members? And what is their line of "reasoning"?

A nephew of mine suffered from a severe brain stroke when he was five. For months he was unable to move except for his eyes. He remained fully conscious though. Now he recovered to some extend but his parents lost their faith in God completely.      On the other hand I just read a story of someone who's daughter became physically and mentally handicapped in an accident but his faith got stronger than before.      What is the difference here? Did my relatives do something wrong? Was their faith not strong enough? Does God withhold his grace to some and not to others?

20090226140823AAxAH2P	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does using religion to help us control our ape-like passions come with a hefty price?	Religion does control the ape-like passions of humans. It is particularly good for controlling the ape-like passions of a large group of people; it’s a behavioral code that is broadcast like a radio signal. But take Islam, for example. I think Arabic people have a tendency to be more ape-like and irrational than other people and as such, Islam is a religion that is more controlling than other religions and this is the price I’m talking about. There have been virtually no inventions, no technology and no inspirational art that have come out of the Middle East in the last two centuries. This is what Islam has done to the people of the Middle East; it has controlled their ape-like passions but it has stifled their creativity. But do you think the situation with Islam can be applied to all religions, in that religions have the ability to control unruly behavior but the trade-off is that they stifle creativity and progress? So therefore, humans should be striving to achieve a broadcast behavioral code that will do what religion does but without the harmful side-effects of religion?

We are often triggered by past memories and experiences and they keep pulling up back. How do you start a new life, forget about the past, and think ahead? It seems impossible to move on, yet it is possible if we seek help from God. But how do we move on? It’s so durable…      I am not speaking for myself, but for those people who have lost loved ones in their life. I am talking about deaths and loss, break up from friendships, etc. It's not easy to move on, but how do we manage and cope in the meanwhile?      -God bless.

But I can't tell if I only know because I'm so close to me and they can't smell it, or if they are just keeping it to themselves.      And in case you're wondering... I sometimes forget because I never needed it in high school. I could be active as heck and get all sweaty, but when I smelled my pits, it'd smell like nothing. So it's not a habit for me to wear it; actually, most of the time, I'm almost out the door when I remember to put it on.

Natalee Halloway, Elizabeth Smart, Jon Benet Ramsey, Laci Peterson and Chandra Levy are all names off the top of my head.      What. Is. The. Deal?

20090226143017AA9oFeu	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	The Way Homosexuals Express Themselves, I don't understand?	before you read this, just understand that I don't have the intentions to be offensive. If you are offended, I apologize. This is just a question for homosexuals.       so I have gay/lesbian friends and people that I know who are attracted to the same sex. (not real good friends, but you get the idea)      When it comes to the guys, they act very feminine,  sometimes even more feminine than any female I know. Now, I am very aware that not ALL gay men act this way or have such a demeanor to them, but I am simply talking about the ones that do, and we are generally speaking here (movies portray gay men this way, TV shows, ect, so its not just me).. If you act like a girl and make yourself sound like a girl, and in recent cases, dress in girls clothing (tight pants that are clearly girl pants) then to me, that is you attempting to be a women. Generally speaking, straight men, who are attracted to women, do not act, sound, dress like that. So why is it that you say that you are a man, who is attracted to men, but you resemble a woman? Does that make you straight then???      The same thing goes for lesbians, maybe even more so. Sometimes, when it comes to meeting a lesbian, I think it's a man. She sounds, dresses, styles her hair, and even stands like a man. Why would I not assume otherwise? Am I being unreasonable? I am asking this because I am not gay so I don't think I could come up with an answer on my own, I just want to have a better understanding of it.      so, to sum my question up, homosexuals are attracted to the same sex, but make themselves look like the opposite sex... why?

He created atheists as a test for the faithful, and grants them sustenance and enjoyment for a while as they disbelieve, before they are annihilated completely. They are born to enter hell.      So how many atheists go to hell on a daily basis?      Judging by the global daily death toll of 170,000, and the global atheist population percentage of 12%, I would say about 20,000 atheists go to hell on a daily basis. Does anyone else more upto date figures? No flaming posts please. If you are atheist yourself, you shouldn't be offended since you don't even believe in a hell! It's okay if you don't believe. God is still preparing a nice punishment for you. Thanks in advance.

20090226142215AAXATBs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question to all Christians?	Question: "Is salvation by faith alone, or by faith plus works?" explain please         my view. The question of faith alone or faith plus works is made difficult by some hard-to-reconcile Bible passages. Compare Romans 3:28, 5:1 and Galatians 3:24 with James 2:24. Some see a difference between Paul (salvation is by faith alone) and James (salvation is by faith plus works). In reality, Paul and James did not disagree at all. The only point of disagreement some people claim is over the relationship between faith and works. Paul dogmatically says that justification is by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9) while James appears to be saying that justification is by faith plus works. This apparent problem is answered by examining what exactly James is talking about. James is refuting the belief that a person can have faith without producing any good works (James 2:17-18). James is emphasizing the point that genuine faith in Christ will produce a changed life and good works (James 2:20-26). James is not saying that justification is by faith plus works, but rather that a person who is truly justified by faith will have good works in his life. If a person claims to be a believer, but has no good works in his life – then he likely does not have genuine faith in Christ (James 2:14, 17, 20, 26).   when you say that works can get you into heaven you create a hierarchy of salvation, that is, the harder and better your works are the better you are than someone who doesn't work hard, and that you can improve yourself, and the idea that you are better that others is the foundation of "Pride" also saying your works can save you is saying that they ( your works), and you, are equal to Christ Jesus, for he is the only one who is perfect and his works are all that matter in our salvation.    also when you try to do works you are following the The Law, that is, it is the guidlines that say what is sin. and nothing goods come from the law, laws only punishes, laws never reward.    the law says don't kill,    so you don't kill, and you are not punished,   neither are you rewarded. reward comes only through the Gospel, our Faith.

Another friend of ours from college was posting things on her facebook like, "I hate secrets, but I have one now" in her notes.  She also has had a status of "sick" or "tired" almost every day for weeks.  Anyhow, we knew she was trying for a baby and since I'd seen these comments, I was speculating that she may be pregnant with my other pregnant friend.  I didn't expect it to get beyond that conversation, but apparently it did and it got back to the girl we were speculating about.  She messaged me last night with a pretty nasty message.  I apologized profusely as I really didn't mean for it to become gossip.  Anyhow, she's still pretty peeved at me, but she did tell me that she is pregnant.  Is this such a horrible offense to do to somebody, or is she overreacting a little?  I know I was really peeved at my mother telling everybody when I told her I was pregnant (and told her to keep it a secret), but I didn't see it as the same thing.

I mean a lot of bisexuals say the wouldn't want to date another bisexual but they expect us non-bisexuals to date them when they won't even date fellow bisexuals. So why do SOME OF THEM expect us to do something they won't do? I mean some say they want to date someone who is either 100% Gay or strait but expect us to look past the fact that there not one or the other. A lot of the bisexuals I know say they feel this way so I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm generalizing, I'm not trying to. It just angers me that they get mad at me for not wanting to date them because they are bi when they too refuse to date a fellow bi. I mean, they obviously know the reasons behind me and other people not wanting to date bisexuals if they won't even do it.

Lets suppose that reincarnation does exist, if you could start a new life, after this one, and could pick your sex, would you choose to be a woman again? Would life be easier as a man or do you love being female, even in a male controlled world? Would you want to explore being the other sex?

20090226143251AATysZV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do people love negative black statistics, but hate great ones like these from the U.S. CENSUS BUREAU?	Like the fact that African immigrants are the most educated    group of people in America. Out of your ignorance and sense of superiority you may shake your head in disbelief but it is very true.       The following link is a TABLE by the U.S. CENSUS BUREAU    that shows that 42.8 PERCENT of African IMMIGRANTS have a BACHELOR'S DEGREE or HIGHER:       http://www.census.gov/population/cen2000...       This University, Bowling Green State University has also done a study on this fact:  http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/news/2008...       Here is a quote:       BOWLING GREEN, O.— "African immigrants in the United States are generally more educated and earn higher salaries    than immigrants from elsewhere. The African immigrants' success, however, depends on what country they come from,    according to a Bowling Green State University study.       His study shows that, overall, African immigrants perform better than the rest of the U.S. population in education and employment."         Yet the only statistics people WANT to know about blacks are the ones that make black people seem violent and inept. THESE statistics annoy them.

20090226144134AAUc3VE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What makes Christianity "right" for you and Jesus the "only way"?	I always see Christians defending the existence of God. Personally, though I remain skeptical, I do not have a huge problem with the concept of a higher power.      But, Christians: what makes this religion right for you?      If you believe Jesus is the only way, why? There are debates on the existence of God, but what are the debates on why Jesus is the only way or not?      I ask you not to use scriptures in the Bible to explain why going through Jesus is the only way. The Bible is a Christian book, so any scriptures from there are in automatic support. I'm looking for evidence outside of the Bible that would suggest Jesus is the only way.

20090226144927AAv9jkd	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Muslims: A question about marriage?	Ok, so there is this guy that seems to be really in love with me. I am 19 and he is 26. He always compliments me and calls me sweet names. I try to tell him not to do so because its not halal because I'm not married to him. He wants to get married to me. I guess at first I wasn't that interested in him but now I feel I've started to fall for him. I want to talk to my parents about this but I have no idea how to tell them. The guy who wants to marry me asked if I want him to ring my father up and talk about this, but I said no because that would be very embarassing for me because it would come as a great shock to my father. I havn't given that guy a yes or no answer yet.      With that being said, I was wondering whether I should say yes or no. His job isn't that great and its a bit of an inconvenient time right now because I'm in my first year of university and so its going to be two more years till I graduate. So I doubt he would relocate near my university because he works in a town many miles away. I'm very confused and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel I can't trust my own decision on this because I'm only 19 and I know nothing about relationships and it is going to be like TORTURE for me to tell my parents and I really don't want to go through that. On the other hand, the guy who proposed to me is very very sweet, caring practicing Muslim and he has a great personality. I feel lost, I just don't know what I should do. Should I just call it off?

20090226140901AACtZHA	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is it really your skin color?	I took an African History class at my school recently and I have started to notice that Black ppl alway blame their skin color for everything. For example, we were talking about housing and people said that 90% of blacks in US live in poverty. I am aware that they had to go through many hardships but today, I am starting to lose respect for them because they always have that excuse "It's because  we are blacks." we didn't get an education opportunity because we are "Blacks." We can't go to University because we are "Blacks."  SO MY QUESTION IS: IS IT REALLY YOUR SKIN COLOR OR THE CHOICES YOU MAKE???      I think that it has nothing to do with your color, it has to do with the choices you make. Everyone can go to school and get an higher education. Everyone can work their way up in US and get out of poverty, it's just many people decide not to. This is the beauty of the US. Plus please stop blaming other for being racist towards you because blacks are just as much racist toward other races as other races are towards blacks. I mean, every culture, color, race, ethnicity faces tough times onces in their lives. its just I been noticing that Blacks always feel like they are the victims, when the truth of the fact is "THEY ARE NOT". So please don't blame your skin color for anything, BLAME YOURSELF!!       what do you guys think?

I'm attracted to her but don't know her nearly well enough to ask (not that I'd be able to outright ask that to anyone).

And, mine is going to be Monarchy. I hope this makes good enough sense so the question can actually get answered, but. I have to have someone make the Laws. Someone that enforces the Laws, and lastly, someone to interpret the Laws. So far, I have heard that Monarchy Countries are very different from the others, so, can, I just go and make anyone in charge of them just like that? Or do I have to do it a specific way?
20090226144138AAYzMqb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian faith is hope?	What is faith?       Faith is a strong belief in something or someone which cannot be proven by logic or evidence.       So what is strong, legitimate faith?      My faith that the sun will come up tomorrow is particularly strong. Though not based on evidence nor logic, as neither of these can predict the future, my faith that the sun will come up is based on the fact that it has risen every other day of my life and seemingly every other day of the lives of every person who has ever lived. There is no reason for me to think that the sun will not come up although the possibility of the sun self-destructing or being destroyed exists there is no particular reason why it should happen tomorrow and even so living without the faith that the sun would come up would be a little ridiculous given the weight of probability that it will. So this is a very strong form of faith.      Second I might have the faith that my wife will come home safely from work. She has come home safely every other day she has been to work and there is no particular reason why she wouldn't come home safely today. I am of course aware that any number of accidents could happen to her, but my faith that she will return is strong, not quite as strong as the sun coming up, knowing that humans are occasionally prone to accidents or misfortune in a much higher frequency than the frequency of the self-destruction of stars      A third form of faith might be that my favourite football team will win at the weekend. They are top of the table and have been winning lots of games. However football being the game that it is, any number of things could go wrong in a game and my team could end up drawing of losing. This is a moderate faith, with a little hope. The faith comes from a knowledge of the players abilities and perhaps their superiority to the opposition, but It would not be right to have a very strong faith that they will win given all the things that could go wrong.      A fourth type of faith would be as above but if my team were bottom of the table. The faith I have in them winning now much more based on hope than faith. Yet knowing football I know it is entirely possible that my team will win, because upsets happen and anyone can win. Yet to have a strong faith that my inferior team will beat a superior team would be a little ridiculous.      A fifth type of faith might be the faith that I possessing a lottery ticket have faith that I will win the lottery. The chances of winning the lottery possessing just one ticket are incredibly small. Yet I know there is an actual prize which someone with a ticket will win. If I said I had a strong faith that I will win the lottery, or any faith at all it would be ridiculous. All I can really have about winning the lottery is a very tiny hope.      Religious faith is the sixth category. Christian faith is based on the idea that a book, written almost 2,000 years ago by a multitude of authors, at different times, edited and translated is the absolutely truthful about the events described within it no matter how unlikely they seem. I think we can talk about probability when it comes to the truth of religious matters.    For example the idea that Jesus was born to a virgin. Which is more probable, that someone was born to a virgin, an event never witnessed or accounted before (apart from in numerous other religious texts and belief systems) or since took place or that the account is false. I have never seen a virgin birth yet I have seen humans be dishonest, unreliable, exaggerate the truth. I have seen the way in which stories change over generations, the way humans develop myths and the way humans fabricate things to improve their own cause. So when it comes to the virgin birth as a Christian, one must chose to belief something which has apparently only happened once ( at least to Christians) over the human traits which we see every day it the world. Which is more probable, of course, the latter. This can be applied to numerous other elements of the bible. The resurrection, miracles, god appearing to people and such. Anyone who has ever studied history will have learnt to question sources even those which are a few years old and question their reliability about worldly claims, let alone supernatural ones. Therefore Christian faith is a systematic belief in the extremely improbable. Christians would no doubt say that, that is why we have faith, faith that these events took place despite their unverifiable nature. But what I argue it that in fact this faith is the lowest form of faith, a type of faith which can accurately described as extremely optimistic hope, not really faith at all.      This does not necessarily mean that it feels like optimistic hope to the believer, through a process of reinforcement and legitimation over the past 2,000 years, Christian faith became seen as a strong form of faith purely because the prevailing religion was Christianity. A strong faith must be based on something likely and faith in a Christ

Ok, so me and my best friend have been best buddies for years now. We do almost everything thing together. We're both number one in our class; both do soccer, swimming, and cross country; have the same classes. Hell, its like he's the brother I always wished for, and never had.      However, the only thing that differentiates us is religion; he's Mormon, and I'm Catholic. We are both pretty cognizant of our differences, yet it we have never had a singular argument over anything, religious or anything else wise.       Recently though, he has been acting strange ...  He's been acting a bit ... well ... homo (no offense if your gay). He winks at me across the room, he hides my stuff, he bumps into me, things like that.       I am aware that both of our religions are opposed to gays, so I do not feel like going up to him and ask, "Hey, how does your religion feel about gays?" He and his family are hardcore Mormons, so I am quite shocked that he may be gay, and i don't wanna make things awkward between us.

20090226150150AA0JNJn	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Was Usury forbidden in the Ancient Christian world?	I learned about this in my World Humanities class, while we were reading Dante's "Inferno," and if you're familiar with it, you would know that Dante Alighieri, the poet, writes an epic poem on the different levels of hell in Christianity.      In one of the levels, the dwellers of hell are amongst Usurers.      Usury is already forbidden in Islam, and I just wanted to point this out, because present-day Christianity allows Usury (At least, to my knowledge, it does).       Does this further prove that Christianity was a stem of the final Abrahamic religion, Islam?      I think it's interesting. What do you think about this?

20090226145627AAM0PAn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should Atheism be against the law?	When I started the Citizens Auxiliary Police I intended to form a group that would peek over the shoulder of the police and our elected officials in order to ensure that our country fought against Sin and progressed toward a righteous and fruitful future.      While Atheism is currently considered legal, the Citizens Auxiliary Police is actively involved in safeguarding the younger generation against the temptations of the godless nation.  Sub-Commander Jim Perry and trainee John Dallas have been commissioned to speak with children, under 10 years old, in public places (like the beach or the park) and put all of the atheist children in the Citizens Auxiliary Police Van (Sub-Commander Perry's '72 Volkswagen) and transport them to the nearest house of God where they can be taught morality and penance.      This course of action has had tremendous success with 22% of all atheist children being baptized the first day they are left at a local church and an additional 14% being baptized when they are picked up and transported a second or third time.  Fellow Christians, will you join me in destroying atheism in the younger generation?  Teach your neighbors children and make sure the cancer that is atheism is cut out in your lifetime!      God Bless!      Jay Santos   Brigadier General   Citizens Auxiliary Police

Have you ever met someone who is completely incapable of running their own lives?  I have met many a person like this.        Only religion or the military seems to help them.  There are people for whom religion is a better option than to be allowed to make their own decisions.  If religion were completely abolished, these poor lost souls would have no one to tell them what to think and how to behave.  Although religion is not necessarily for people who are capable of independent, productive thought and action, it does have its place no?      What say ye?

She replied sayin that I dont get paid for taking the test and it is on my own time in order to get the job?      Now is that true that I dont get paid for the tests?Is that legal? Cause I worked at Big Lots and Foodlion and we got paid for the tests we did before we started work?      What should i say to her? It this legal for them or illegal?

It has totally turned me off from women sexually. I hate my penis, but for some reason I like all others. Being with a woman reminds me of being male way too much. However, I don't like men in that way I don't think. I fantasize about giving men oral sex, and cuddling with them. I have given a T-Girl oral sex and loved it.       I know I don't want to be a full on female, or drag/ct/transvestite/transsexual because when i dress up feminine I feel ugly and it turns me on sexually which makes me feel like a perv.

We've decided to take some time apart, to devote our selves to God, and become closer better Christians. He decided to spend some time alone to overcome sexual frustrations. We've both not lived right in the past and are now trying to straighten up. I agree with him that we both should strive to be better people and live or christ, but i think we could work through it together. He says that he can't over come the sexual things with me in his life, but this makes ot really hard. He tells me he loves me and i still love him very much. I'm hoping that if i do try to get closer to God and ,I really do want to for many reasons not just because of him, that God will bless us and let us be together without the temptations of sin.I don;t know how long it will take us to get where we need to be with God, but i am very stressed about it all. I know that God's will will ultimately be done, and i;m praying that i can make it through everything. I know God doesn't give us anything we can't handle and so all i can do now is pray and try to get close to Him. But it's hard going from being with your boyfriend all the time, to not having them there to talk to. sorry this is so long. Please any helpful advice would be appreciated! THANKS GOD BLESS!!!!
