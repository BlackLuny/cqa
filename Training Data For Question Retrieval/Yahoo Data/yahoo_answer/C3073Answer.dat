FdHfzDoPaa	hah small world because i already asked that question and someone ansered that i can be a caddy at a golf course.|`|RX4nj825aa	gosh... not alot of 13 yrs. get jobs eside babysitting!!!<br>  sorry|`|e3mj4v0uaa	Job finding couldnt be any easier, i suggest you visit here first www.meyes.info/seekjob|`|3hu7tgS8aa	At your age, your best options, is to start your own business.  examples:<br>  Mowing Lawns/yard work<br>  Washing Cars<br>  Picking up Pet Poop (pays BIG)<br>  Walking Pets (pays BIG)<br>  Bathing Pets<br>  Running Errands<br>  Doing  Garage Sales<br>  Selling Newspapers<br>  There are many things a young person can do on their own...you just have to get out there and find your niche.   Being young, you probably are still at home, so you have little overhead (a roof over your head, and food to eat).  If you live in a large community/city, check the local laws concerning permits to do certain things.  Some services require a license/permit to operate.  Even though you are a minor, any moneys you earn, can put you into a taxable situation requiring you to file reports on your earnings.   Better to learn all this now, and not find out after you've spent your earnings and find that you owe IRS, or the local state comptroller for unpaid taxes.  <br>  Don't let your age block you from getting out and earning a living.   Some of the wealthiest men in the world started out like you...|`|0boTBFEVaa	I dont know if that was a joke or a job picking up pet poop an the last answer dont think it will pay big but. since you are only 13 you really need a permit if you want to work you will find one at school and also you can try a web site that i use to make money<br>  Its free safe fun easy and fast but not much but its money and its free money hope i help|`|186AWszkaa	you can work at fiesta or grocery store or if not jus clean your house and do chores in your house so ur mom can give you money<br>  <br>  <br>  i live in DALLAS  pleasant grove
AULn9uPYaa	This is a serious answer.<br>  My daughter is 12 and she has worked for friends. In one case she was driving a tractor picking pumpkins, the other as a dress-up character. You have to let people know you are keen and no matter how dirty the work turn up on time. You can get work at Macca's Coles etc at the age of 14. You must have your parent's permission. Every business like this has a web site that you need to apply from. Fast Food places have application forms. Go in and ask for one, that will give you an idea of what to expect. There are limits of how many hours and times you can work. Get your application in around your birthday or just before.<br>  Good Luck|`|AA12074269	You can not work in a shop etc (unless it is a family business and you are working off the books) until you are 14 and 9 months old. <br>  <br>  BUT some shops, supermarkets have a higher age limit e.g. 15-16 this is because you need to be avaiable to work all hours (if the shop closes at midnight e.g. coles - then you need to be available) and younger kids often are not.|`|XzicOcyeaa	it's unlikely that you would get a job, especially as there are likely to be older candidates. I would try getting a job as a baby sitter for family friends or something. My friends sister who is 14 recently got a job at a supermarket....so it's not impossible! You could always deliver newspapers or pamphlets etc. I did this when i was 12, as age isn't a factor. The pay is good but it's quite time consuming. Good luck!|`|gU0ahpEzaa	you can make  more than  100$ in 1 month with out doing any work out side .i ll give u my blog where i had registered in 4 sites where we ll get paid for doing such things.the 3 sites i registered are <br>  <br>  1. ciao<br>  <br>  here in the above site you ll get paid to write reviews .u ll get nearly 3$ at starting and in later stages u ll even have more.now i am getting more than 7$ daily from this site.last month i have earned 127.43$<br>  <br>  please register for this site  if u like it.<br>  <a href="http://www.ciao.com/reg.php?AffiliateId=10016721" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.com/reg.php?AffiliateId=...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  2.6dgr<br>  <br>  this is another site where u ll get 3$ for reffering a friend 2 $ for  reffering friends friends and 1$ for the 3rd level reffering and so on for 6 levels .i have recently joined under it and got first payment.<br>  <br>  if u like it register  here<br>  <a href="http://www.6dgr.com/index.php?mode=join&ref_id=28541" rel="nofollow">http://www.6dgr.com/index.php?mode=join&...</a><br>  <br>  3.lookinad<br>   <br>  this is another site where u ll get 5$ just for registering and payout is 25$.u ll get paid for inviting friends and compleet surverys .if u compleet one survey u ll get 5000 points (5$)<br>  and it is having a 6 refferal level system .so that u ll get paid for 6 refferal levels.<br>  if u want to register click on the below link.<br>  <a href="http://www.lookinad.com/Registration/Register.aspx?mlid=d7cc2bd6-f68a-4d6b-9e74-087a6b9dd1f5" rel="nofollow">http://www.lookinad.com/Registration/Reg...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4.myhpf<br>  this is another site where u ll get paid to search .u ll have a yahoo search engine and for every search u ll get 0.01 euro.i earned 37 euros from this site.<br>   if u like this site register here<br>  <a href="http://www.myhpf.co.uk/banner.asp?Friend=363630" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhpf.co.uk/banner.asp?Friend...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this is my blog<br>  <a href="http://my-onlineearning.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://my-onlineearning.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this is my email have any doubts plze send message i ll help u.<br>  ashwin_reddy19@yahoo.com|`|caPFpkqSaa	Yes of course she can if she is a genius
CLeIUeQeaa	Hi, thanks for the answer for my question. Feeling abit depressed after hearing the situation of the employment market there...... read through some of ur questions posted....understand why u did u move to australia....<br>  well for me ...i am facing kinda bottleneck rite now, in work , relationship and other things...I had planned to move to a new place and start everything brand new there....but first of all i need to secure a job and support myself ......it seems quite difficult under this eco....<br>  Feeling quite loss at the moment....<br>  By the way, u mentitoned to secure a job before going... it is qutie difficult for me ....as i am sill in the entry level and nt yet got my memebership...:(<br>  <br>  Well, Hope u can get a job soon...:D|`|AA12074269	Look at getting employed by a temp agency to gain the experience. Even if the work is at a much lower level than your ideal - then you will have the foot in the door so to speak.<br>  <br>  The problem may be the view that you dont have experience with the Australia working ethos - if you come from an Asian country they might be concerned you can not work in an easy going working environment.<br>  <br>  Also try the universities in the area - they generally have their own temping pool.
AA11199260	Yes. Makro, Metro, Ebay. These are stores lke Hot Gopic.

7NUhLhB5aa	I honestly do not know of a speciality bakery that would be able to make a cake of that size for less than 300 dollars.<br>  <br>  However, Wegmans makes *amazing* sheet cakes, for relatively cheap- I believe a 1/4 or a 1/2 sheet is 29.99 (and I believe that feeds close to 25-30). They also do really, really nice decorating. Maybe you can talk to them about possibly combining smaller sheet cakes together to make it tiered? I also know, since I got my graduation cake done there, that if you bring in your own decorations (i had a plastic hat, for instance), that they will combine it and add it to your cake for free.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest the Wegmans in Pittsford, NY (its one of the biggest and nicest ones)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2kl0vQjVaa	Aside from a grocery/chain store, I don't know where you would find a 100 serving fondant cake for that price.  You might want to check on hiring a culinary student.|`|l0jixLszaa	<April Reed Cake Design><br>  212-358-7071; aprilreed.com<br>   <br>  If Audrey Hepburn were a cake, she’d be one of April Reed’s.
