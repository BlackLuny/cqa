20090203163543AAkiXYE	Travel;Mexico;Other - Mexico	Ensenada, Mexico trip?	My friends & I went to Ensenada, Mexico two times last year, once in February, once in August. We went with our friend who has family there, so he knew his way around & everything, even though we stayed on the same street the whole time because our hotel was walking distance from the clubs & such. We had absolutely no problem, everyone was so nice, we didn't even see so much as one cop car the whole time, we were never in any danger, nothing. Well, now we want to go back in April for four people's birthdays, so we're going in a big group. We just started planning it & we're really excited. The problem is, my friend just messaged me & said that his girlfriend just got back from Rosarita today & she told him not to go because Tijuana, Rosarita, & Ensenada all have curfews & no one's allowed out past dark & that people are getting murdered all the time & that there's military everywhere in the streets. But the weird thing is, I can't find anything like that online, & my friend goes there to visit family all the time & just got back a couple weeks ago & is planning on going back next week & stuff. So I just figure he wouldn't want to go back & would let us know if that was the case. I know that Tijuana isn't the safest, we never stay there, all we do is switch buses there [we do NOT drive ourselves, we ride greyhound buses from San Diego to Tijuana, then Tijuana to Ensenada. We just feel safer that way!]. But I've never heard or seen problems in Ensenada. Please help me! We really don't want to cancel our trip for nothing. And PLEASE only answer if you know. Don't just guess.
