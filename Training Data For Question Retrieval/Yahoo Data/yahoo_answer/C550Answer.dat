You need to go to the doctor and make sure theirs nothing wrong.

fqlrKcphaa	yup that happened to me too and im 12 they put this thing inside ur mouth then they took pics of u absolutley freaked me out|`|YkD4Pf2Raa	yeah, i had this last week too. i had a normal (non-smiling) face-on and profile, then a smiling face-on and profile, then an angled profile. then i had various shots taken inside my mouth using mirrors and plastic hook things to pull my mouth away. i felt slightly uncomfortable at the time having the photos done, but im glad i've had them done because loads of my friends say that after a few weeks they forget what their teeth looked like before, and it will be interesting to refer to.|`|yG0XF83waa	yeah this is normal. They do this to everyone so you as the patient can see what has changed about your teeth.|`|LDHge3kfaa	my orthodontist took pictures of my teeth from the front and side view..but i dont recall taking pictures inside of my mouth.  but i think they keep it on file so they can take pictures of ur teeth after u get ur braces off so u can see the improvement|`|b3c1Yeqeaa	yes this is normal i had it done.  On my file they have a small picture of me before braces.  I had to get the same thing done and it was a little wierd for me too but my orthodontist isnt a creeper.
0lCnu1g2aa	If it is a 10 cc syringe draw back 7cc of air and inject almost all of it into the saline bottle after wiping the top with alcohol. Then draw out the 7 cc of saline to make 10cc. If it is not in a 10cc syringe  and you have a small needle put the needle into the 10cc syringe with 7cc of saline ad squirt it into the syringe, not really conventional way, but would work.|`|F6j2YIw5aa	Does it really matter how much NS you have in the syringe?  Not really, so long as you're going to give all of it.<br>  <br>  So draw up NS into the syringe and make sure that you do not inject into the bottle.  Remove the air by the usual means.  Then give it to the patient, being sure to give the entire content of the syringe.<br>  <br>  If you feel that there is even the slightest chance that you contaminated the NS bottle with the medication, toss the bottle when you're done.<br>  <br>  That's how I do it!

kTVQ4QeGaa	hi there.<br>  <br>  epilepsy can be a really, really frightening condition. seizures can be come out in all sorts of different ways, and while they're happening your mind does all sorts of weird things. I've walked out of the house and into the middle of a busy road before while having a seizure.<br>  I know it feels like your body and mind are ganging up on you, but you've got to remember that for the time that the seizure is happening it's not really 'you're mind' because it's malfunctioning at that moment.<br>  <br>  the seizures are caused by a burst of activity, sparking between the neurons. when that's happening you're having a siezure, and you're mind is acting differently to the way it should.<br>  <br>  you're not possessed by demons or anything like that, and don't let anybody on this site or anywhere else tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  go back to your doctor and let them know what's happening. <br>  keep strong, you can beat it. good luck.|`|G0U6BgZSaa	Epilepsy is not caused by demons, its caused by impulses in the brain. During a fit, your mind will shut off, and certain parts of your brain will not work properly - this can cause loss of automony/control over your movements, which is why your hand may end up covering your mouth. <br>  Other people lose control of their bladders, or other bodily functions. It all depends on the way the impulses in your brain are stimulated or prevented. <br>  If you are really concerned, talk to your GP or consultant for more information on epilepsy and why you have certain symptoms during a fit. <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps.|`|E8Z5PWmcaa	epilepsy isnt caused by demons, you are basically having an electrical storm in your brain and "short circuiting" for a while. I've got epilepsy myself and I know that you can feel like you're dreaming or that your having an out of body experience, but this is part of the fit, or some people call them auras. When your having a fit you lose all control of your actions andyou could cover your mouth or wet yourself, but just because you have no conscious control of your actions does not mean that demons are in your body. <br>  The Bible used to think demons were the cause of fits, but years later we have the medical knowledge to know what these seizures are-just your brain getting bombarded with electrical impulses, hence the brain gets overloaded and has to "shut down" for a while (the fit) untill it is able to function safely again.<br>  Sorry if that was a bit disorganised or vague or something lol|`|SDHmVDlNaa	Not in any possible way is it caused by demons. The only reason people think such things is because they can't explain what happens in a seizure.  Our doctor told us it is like having a cascading thunderstorm in your brain.  In my daughters case it is caused by a missing gene.  In your case it may be that or it may be something else.  It could be a slight spot  in your brain or a brain injury.  Please don't blame demons on your disease.  The more they find out about this illness the more they find that they can control it.  I would look into the keto diet if I were you or the Modified Atkins diet.  Talk to your doctor about your thoughts and he or she will surely assure you that it is NOT any sort of demon or spirit that is causing this.  Sometimes when you have a seizure it can cause you to think you see things and feel things that aren't really there.  Like a dream with your eyes open when a seizure is about to occur.  Hope that helps a little.
fywbC6SAaa	You should go to a doctor as soon as possible if you find any blood in your underwear. Try a warm bath and and early night, but if you're still experiencing them, go to the doctor regardless of the blood and see if everything's okay.|`|HAueVh8Naa	well i had m/c in june and it was so painfull .if you were having a m/c you would be in extreme pain and alot of blood and clots .i dont get cramps im pregnant itslike by my ovaries its fine though
LDHge3kfaa	sorry, but sounds like your jaw might b locked.  i used to wake up at night when that happened to me because it hurt so bad.  but i would just wait for like a little less than an hour i think and it would go back to normal, but i dont know why.   but u can always call your dentist/orthodontist or doctor and see if they have any advice|`|J4xHSslgaa	Yep I have the exact same problem its called TMJ disorder (google it) you should see you dentist asap mine has been here for a year and still not got better , i cant open it wide enough nor can i eat solid foods :(
9794VMZ9aa	Mine was 2-3 weeks late, yet I didn't suffer anything bad, not even cramps, just a little tiny stomach pain on my first day, but not so much to make me feel bad.<br>  I'm on the 3rd day now, and I think it's slowing down because it's very light , which is odd seeing as my last period was 7 days long (again, no cramps) and was normal flow.<br>  <br>  Then again, we are all different.|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	yes, the later it is, the worse it usually is.|`|InkvzZKAaa	ye - i'm 2 weeks late and i'm still not on but have bad camps !!
AA11563237	Adam,<br>  Abdominal pain is a very tricky animal. There are countless things that it could be, and it is impossible to diagnose without examination.I will say that if you are having acute pain in your abdomen, you need to seek professional medical help immediately. I do however believe that it is imperative that you should know general medical signs and symptoms, and how to respond and what to look for. <br>  In general the presence of a fever or general lethargy (tired/flu like symptoms) is an indication that your body is attempting to fight an infection by raising your body temperature to fight the bacteria in your system. <br>  Left sided abdominal pain generally is a side affect of one of the following conditions:<br>  - Appendicitis (Left Lower abdomen)<br>  - Diverticulitis (Generally presents after eating greasy food, seeds)<br>  - Pancreatitis (dont bother, you need a sonogram)<br>  - Possible bowel obstruction (you would generally be constipated)<br>  - Ulcer (once again....dont bother)<br>  <br>  and the list goes on and on....... Good luck and go see a physician!!!|`|W7j2zERHaa	this will most likely mean you have a heart problem and will die

a037ab7bd7d5c99eb24febe53de18a46aa	No. You HAVE to use medicine to get rid of them.<br>  <br>  It is the same as head lice; those don't go away on its own.<br>  <br>  The treatment is painless. You usually get some shampoo for the crabs.<br>  <br>  To help get rid of the crabs, you need to shave your pubs because the crabs need the hair to lay their eggs.<br>  <br>  they just itch. That is the only thing they do; just drink your blood and make you itch.|`|AA11193401	no|`|U6aPgnQwaa	seriously? lol nooooooo why would u even think that go to the doctors and get mads
QjgxH7Ouaa	I know.  It gets hard sometimes.  Just try to relax and work on assertiveness.  Best wishes to you.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	I can definitely relate.  You need to feel selfish for a bit.  You've been made to feel like you don't deserve to feel happy, sad, excited, worried, etc.  Feel these emotions, and let it show.  People won't condemn you for being you.  <br>  <br>  You might want to seek therapy.|`|TnH7OcOKaa	Well, when I get slapped, either I walk away with a scowl on my face or I laugh.

You should be at least 115. It would be better if you were 120-125 though. You seriously need to put some weight on. If you get sick, you are going to be in really bad shape because your health isn't where it should be. Trust me, you would look better too and probably feel better. <br>  And some girls grow their boobs later than others. I was a size A until I was 16. I'm 23 now and a size C, so don't worry about it.
mkPvSw2Uaa	That happened to me when i first started my period. at firsts i thought that it wasnt in far enough...so i made sure that it was always as far as it will go. just remember that it will come out and not get stuck. also try not to consintrate so much on having your tampon in because then u no its inside of u so u think u can feel it. hope that helps. good luck :)!|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	wait till your period is heavy and try to insert a slim fit one. then move up sizes.|`|7UfK1CPZaa	if you put in right, you shouldn't feel it, you probably didn't put it far enough in. Or it's too big.|`|qRwykCMoaa	well a year doesn't give your "part" enough time to get bigger so that such things as tampons can go through. And yes it's supossed to hurt at first but it shouldn't burn. I don't know what you did wrong. I waited 4 years to wear tampons after getting my period. I think it was worth the wait.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Once the applicator is in you, stop and let go for a second. That will make sure the angle is correct. THEN, push the tampon out of the applicator and so forth.<br>  <br>  Smaller size might be a good idea as well|`|x2DweOpqaa	you either didn't push it in far enough, didn't push it straight (pushed at an awkward angle), or your vagina was not wet enough.|`|V9q0sYLSaa	you probably didnt put it up far enough, or maybe your using hte wrong size.
QjgxH7Ouaa	You just want to be accepted by everyone.  you haven't found out who you really are yet.  What do you like?  What do you want to do?  How do you want to speak?  The next time you're around someone, try to totally be yourself.  If they think you're weird, then remember, THEY ARE THE WEIRD ONE!  Don't let anyone steal your joy.|`|oTKkXEjUaa	I am like this too. Even though we don't want to conciously just change ourselves to fit it, we unconciously do it.<br>  I know that with some people it is not that I am acting like them, but I feel more comfortable doing certain things, saying things, etc.. while with other people it's just me changing to be like them. When I really realized I was doing this was one time I was talking to my friend who has a British accent and I started talking with a British accent but I caught myself and thought it was really weird! '<br>   I don't think it's anything wrong with us, just adapting to the other person's personality to fit it better. If it bothers you then just try to act the same and find your real self. I know sometimes I just feel like running to somewhere far away where other people won't affect me lol.|`|3sZSkepVaa	Feeling different around different people is perfectly normal, but if you seriously feel like you have 3 different personalities, you should see a psychologist. Just try to relax around people. Some people feel this way if he/she is in love with the person.|`|0j2E9WPEaa	i do that too...<br>  its kind of confusing!<br>  <br>  and trust me it doesn't work out too well<br>  like around the popular people i act like i know all the cool stuff<br>  <br>  and yeah.<br>  <br>  and i hate it!|`|tVF9O1Olaa	Maybe you have low self esteem and feel you need to be like that to be liked by each person you are with? If you are like them then they will like you. <br>  Try to find out who you are? Things you like? And don't be ashamed of who you are! If people don't like you for who you are then they are not worth having as a friend.<br>  <br>  If this does sound like you then look up ways to boost self esteem and work on that.|`|fwWq2llXaa	It sounds like you have a bad case of people-pleasing....wanting to fit in so you act the way you think they want you too.  The only problem with this - is you can lose yourself in the meantime.  Be true to you - just be yourself.  If you notice that you have a hard time doing this and think you have multiple personality disorder, then consult a psychiatrist
oTKkXEjUaa	Everyone who answered so far are really rediculous. Wow.<br>  <br>  Anyways, everyone can feel like this at times. I suggest you figure out something that you are good at, I'm sure there's soemthing, and do that. Or just do something and try really hard at it. For example, start taking dance classes and just practice 2 hours a night, you'll get good. Also, don't compare yourself to other people, that can make it even worse!<br>  When I feel like this then I always help someone. I go and volunteer somewhere then I am fulfilled with the idea of being selfless that I don't worry about being good at something myself.<br>  Stop worrying about how bad you are at something and start thinking about how good you are at it.<br>  I'm sure it's all in your head. We can all get down sometimes. :)<br>  xx|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Take an online skills quiz.  They are fun and it will tell you what you're good at.  I wanted to quit my job a few years ago and I took some of the quizzes and it pinpointed my strengths and weaknesses.<br>  <br>  Just google it.<br>  <br>  P.S.  You don't suck at everything.  QUIT BELIEVING  A LIE!<br>  <br>  Best Wishes on a bright future!|`|xu0R3ojaaa	No-one is good at something the first time they try it. Failure is part of learning. If you don't realize you "suck" at it the first time then you don't know to work harder to be better at it.<br>  If something means enough to you, you will work hard to be good at it. When you are good at it you will feel pride in your achievement, and know that you have value as a person. This sounds silly but it is true. Find something you want to be good at and work at it until you are. Don't pick something impossible though - you need to have the basic physical attributes for it.|`|ro1yMxZ9aa	I hope you do not feel this way all the time.  I am sure that you do not give yourself enough credit.  You are able to post here so you are computer savy.<br>  <br>  If this is a feeling that comes and goes then you have a lot of company.  Try to talk positive to yourself until you believe it.  Also try to be around people who love and support you.  If there is someone in your life dragging you down let them know and tell them to stop.  You should be enjoying your life to the fullest.  That is how you will excel and master things.|`|3tSDAIukaa	hallo! well i am a strong believer that no one sucks at EVERYTHING! lol my advice 2u is to try different things, because then youll find something your gud at. for ehm instance b4 i found out i was good at music und playing instruments, i tried sports. then i realised i wasnt really..athletic lol so i tried some other things, then i found it. im sure if you do the same, you can find sumthing your gud at und it will be your favourite thing after that. vastrau mir! "trust me. hope this helps you, if not im srry|`|NFgZCh4Naa	no, your parents suck at parenting.  you dont suck at everything.  you were taught to feel that way.  im guessing you are younger.  many young adults and teens feel like they suck at everything.  you probably are good at stuff that you get no support for.  believe in yourself and stop seeking approval from people who dont get it.|`|U1wAKo1Gaa	Oooohhhh Yore, that answer is way too cute; first smile I've had all day; but way, way inappropriate ya know!!!  <br>            now, Maggie!!!  First, you've got to get therapy and figure out y you have such a low self esteem, unless you already know why, of course.  There is bound to be something you are good at....find it and do it over and over again while telling yourself that you are good, you are worthy, and you are special.  I know it seems very silly but I promise you it will make a difference.  Also, and just as corny, leave yourself sticky notes all ove the house reminding you just how special and distinct you really are.......again, it works.  Lastly, and more corny than before.....stand and look at yourself in the mirror....tell yourself over and over that you love you, you are worthy, you mean something, etc.  It does work, just don't have any "flies on the wall".  Good Luck and "If nobody else has told you today that they love you, I'm telling you now.......I love you, girl!!"  Good Luck Sweets!!!

fk9AvB25aa	Chlamydia can be treated and cured if you caught it early enough. If you caught it again then that would reduce your fertility.

deYDbVDSaa	Change your workout where you do not use a straight bar. The barbell (or any straight bar) is causing the problem. Use dumbbells for a while.
3sZSkepVaa	That is a good question. I have heard that spirits are most active during the 3 am hour. I have also heard that 3:15 is like the devil's time. The movie the amityville horror shows that very strange things happen at 3:15. Many people wake up at this time and don't know why. It could, however, be something as simple as a neighbor who comes home from work around this time each night, or maybe there is something physical in your house that make a sound every night around this time like the furnace or something. If you have a chance you should stay up until 3 to see if there is anything that makes a certain noise. It could be a subconscious thing though too, like the movie the amityville horror freaking you out. Most likely though it is a physical cause.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	maybe beacuse your body wants too|`|gpJOSJw0aa	My body is designed to wake up at 7 on the dot on the weekdays.

a5MzSF5qaa	If both are used probably they each give you a 99% accuracy right? So you are looking at 1% of 1% of the amount of times you have sex that you may become pregnant. So, statistically you'll have to have sex 10000 and in that time you may become pregnant once. It's pretty good odds, as long as you use them the right way.|`|oAIXNK9naa	Much less than 1% if you use both correctly.

I know how hard it is to quit but like the previous poster said, you have to desire to quit, once you do this You will win at it.  Meth rots your teeth and messes up the membranes of your nostrils, also can lead to illicit sex which could eventually cause you Aids which is what happened to me.  Meth was not the cause of my contracting Aids but the effects of what I did under the influence.  Hope this rings a bell.  Dave|`|6mcc8U79aa	Although I have no web links for you, I can tell you from experience that trying to quit meth is hard. I'm not sure how long you've been doing it but I started in 6th grade, did it for two years and finally my mum saw what was happening and got me into rehab. I missed my 8th grade year because I was in rehab the whole time. One suggest is if you end up going to rehab (Which will help out alot) try looking for an activity that you really enjoy doing. When the urge to use comes do that activity instead. I learned that I like boxing. So when I think about using I take out my gloves and beat the crap out of a punching bag. It gives me a similar feeling, but I'm much healthier. I hope I've helped, and good luck! ^_^

AG9msdUDaa	What works for me is diluting 5-6 drops of oregano oil in about 250mL of water, taking a little sip 3-4 times a day for one to three days, and gargling it for about a minute before swallowing. It tastes awful, but it works ;)|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this for some relief. Boil 1 teaspoon of powdered cinnamon powder and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper powder in a glass of water add 1 teaspoon of honey to it and drink sip by sip for effective relief from sore throat ,cold and cough, repeat this every 2 hours until you feel a little better.

So, it works beautifully for some people but there are alot of people who are very frustrated with this product. Let me tell you why:<br>  <br>  There is good science behind Proactiv and that is why it works for some people. But Proactiv skin care products just are not strong enough for people with stubborn acne and/or the skin adapts to the regimen. <br>  <br>  For most people, Proactiv seems to work nicely for about three weeks and then it seems to stop working. Since Proactiv never gets to see your skin or talk to you about how your skin is reacting or adapting, they can't very well recommend the products strong enough to get rid of acne conditions that are difficult. <br>  <br>  It takes potent exfoliants and anti-bacterials used in the right way to get acne under control. If you don't have someone guiding you through this process, you will either:<br>  <br>  1. Not have strong enough products and you will still have acne; or<br>  <br>  2. The products will be to too strong or you will use too much too soon and irritate your skin and you will still have acne.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sound like too much?

There are tests that a doctor can run to try and determine how much longer you'll have them, but that's just an educated guess.<br>  <br>  And you can't gauge yourself based on you family history either. I am already older than both my mother and her mother were when they stopped, and I show no signs of slowing down. By the way, I started when I was 12.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but csangel12345 is dead wrong.

Well, I hope so, because at that age you cannot know for sure if you want children or not. I didn't want kids either when I was your wife's age, but now I'm 27 and the thought seems more and more appealing. :)<br>  <br>  Just use condoms or get her on a different birth control, like the depo shot or that implant for your arm.|`|iRlm3mOuaa	IF at 25 you feel so strongly about your no baby policy, what makes you think you are going to change your mind if your relationship doesn't work with this woman down the road? I've never been interested in having children either.<br>  <br>  I think a vasectomy is a good idea. My dad eventually got a vasectomy. He figured 4 children was enough.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Do it man.

Look them up on Wkipedia, on the web site of Planned Parenthood.  There are way too many other sites that are anti-vasectomy.  Most of them are owned by the Catholic Church, or the LDS Church.<br>  <br>  Only accept first hand accounts from men that actually had a vasectomy.  Everything else is urban legend.  I have noted that most of the people handing out advice hardly even know what a vasectomy is.<br>  <br>  I had mine when I was 21.  It took about 10 min.  It was for the most part painless.  I have no scar.  It was the best choice I ever made.<br>  <br>  The key is to follow the doctors instructions.  Do not try to be 'macho' and do some kind of physical exercise immediately following your surgery.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of men out there that are against vasectomies.  They all have two things in common... They have more children than they can afford, and they are ignorant.  It is that simple.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|09DE4NG3aa	Do it.  If you are both sure, then go for it.  If you both don't want kids, then make sure that you don't have them.  I got pregnant on birth control when I was younger, so vasectomy is the absolutely safe option - just make sure you wait until it is safe after the snip.  I know a couple who had the snip, then had unprotected sex before getting the all clear, and now have twins on top of the three kids they had before the vasectomy.|`|uM2IZBobaa	Yahoo!

Up to 10% of men regret their decision later which fuels the 30,000 reversals done per year in the U.S.<br>  <br>  2) The incidence of chronic testicualr pain after vasectomy. This complication affects up to 15% of men and of course has negative effects on their sexual function and quality of life.<br>  <br>  Many post-vasectomy surveys document chronic scrotal or testicular pain that can interfere with sexual function or sexual enjoyment and cause some men to regret their decision to pursue vasectomy (McMahon et al 1992, Choe and Kirkemo, 1996, Ahmed et al, 1997, Morris et al, 2002, Manikandan et al 2004, Leslie et al 2007). Post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS) is usually characterized by chronic or intermittent testicular and/or epididymal pain and is frequently worsened by intercourse or ejaculation. PVPS can be exacerbated by vigorous physical activity, and is frequently accompanied by tender or full epididymides (Nangia et al, 2000). Symptoms can be unilateral or bilateral and the pain can radiate into the groin or abdomen along the course of the spermatic cord structures. Several studies have concluded that a discussion of chronic post-vasectomy testicular pain should be included in the pre-vasectomy informed consent process (Morris et al 2002, Manikandan et al, 2004). A study by Choe and Kirkemo concluded that chronic scrotal pain was the most common post-vasectomy complication that could adversely affect quality of life (Choe and Kirkemo, 1996). If a patient is not made aware of this risk pre-operatively and then develops symptoms, a severe, life altering outcome has occurred with no warning. The very nature of the affect of chronic genital pain on the patient’s quality of life necessitates its inclusion in pre-operative dialogue and on the written vasectomy consent.<br>  <br>  3) Vasectomy causes testicular damage over time. Testicular damage has been described in most mammalian studies that have specifically looked at histological changes after vasectomy. There are several human studies in the literature that have reported similar post-vasectomy testicular damage that worsens with obstructive interval. These findings have included degeneration of spermatids, reduced spermatogenesis, testicular interstitial fibrosis, loss of Sertoli cells, decreases in depth of the epithelium and increases in thickness of the basement membrane or peritubular fibrosis (Jarow et al, 1985, Jarow et al, 1994, Raleigh et al, 2004, McVicar et al, 2005, White et al, 2000). In some studies of post-vasectomy testicular pathology there was also a general finding of decreased fertility after vasovasostomy in the specimens with significant scarring or focal interstitial fibrosis (Jarow et al, 1985, McVicar et al 2005). It has been postulated that these changes are due to the increased pressure proximal to the testicular end of the vas, or are inflammatory or autoimmune in nature. <br>  <br>  Overall - not a good idea.|`|LYeMqJIRaa	Honestly I think that you both are a little young.  My wife and I were not ready to have kids until we were in our 30's (I really didn't have any desire to be a dad in my 20's but couldn't imagine not having my girls today).  If you decide to go through with it please do not make the mistake I  made and base your research on what Urologists tell you as it is a big business and they downplay the possible side effects.  I had mine done on 06/05/08 and since then have lost almost all sensation at ejaculation. A few months after I developed prostatitis (common after vas) and after a month of that pain I developed new pain that required surgery on 02/13 I thought (hoped) that the surgery would fix the problem but as the pain from the surgery subsides I still have testicular pain (think of a dull toothache in your testicles 24/7 punctuated by the occasional feeling of someone putting them in a vise and slowly squeezing them to the point of you doubling over and feeling like you are going to vomit then  releasing them, over and over).

However, I do believe that the 2 of you are just too young for such a permanent decision. You do not want to consider that <br>  1. life circumstances change<br>  2. your views/feelings may (and probably will change)<br>  3. it is imprudent to close a door to something you had never experienced<br>  4. what if this is not the only marriage in yours or hers lifetime?<br>  <br>  Contraception is just an inconvenience, not a disaster - I had used contraception (many kinds - from 18 to 34 years of age - when my ex had his vasectomy - and we both survived, and had a great sex life.Never had an "oops" pregnancy<br>  <br>  Educate yourselves about options for contraception -there are many more now than in "my time".<br>  <br>  Wait with the vasectomy, keep that door open
c5ScseTdaa	If you're that little and your stomach isn't flat, it might not be fat.  Any chance it's water or gas?  My mother and I have some wicked food allergies that keep our stomachs disproportionately large.  Gross and sad, but true.  Check and see if your stomach seems larger on some days than others. Mine looks better if I eat protein and spinach than if I eat grains, broccoli, and beans.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the crunches.  Whew, wish I could say the same!  Some of my favorite ab exercises are the plank, the corkscrew, and this chair thing with no seat:  you hang there with your back and arms supported, and lift your knees to your chest.  It sounds simple, but it's incredibly effective and you're bound to feel it.  Most gyms have this thing, I just don't know what it's called.<br>  <br>  The plank is very simple:  act like you're going to do a pushup.  Your body should be very straight and rigid.  Instead of pushing up, however, lay your forearms on the floor so that your body is only supported by your forearms and your toes.  Hold your body straight without letting your hips sink, and you'll feel your abs working.  30 seconds is a good place to start, and work up to a couple of minutes over time.<br>  <br>  The corkscrew is also simple, but I don't find it as effective as the other two.  Lay on your back and stick your legs up in the air, ankles together.  Now draw a circle with the bottom of your feet:  first to the right six times, then to the left.  Repeat until you feel muscle fatigue.<br>  <br>  I like these because crunches make my neck hurt.

nIzmM8K3aa	Here are a couple of push up formats you can do:<br>  <br>  1.Military Push Ups<br>  Step1 Place your toes and hands on the floor, making sure your back and arms are straight. Keep your hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart and tighten your abdominal muscles. <br>  <br>  Step2 Inhale as you lower yourself to the floor, stopping as your elbows reach a 90-degree bend. Keep your body from touching the floor. <br>  <br>  Step3 Exhale and push yourself away from the floor. Don't lock your elbows, and don't bend your back. <br>  <br>  Step4 Repeat several sets.<br>  <br>  2.Modified Push Up:<br>  <br>  Step1 Place your hands and knees on the floor. Keeping your gluts and abs tight, your back should be in one diagonal line with your head and neck, and your feet should be lifted from the floor. <br>  <br>  Step2 Inhale as you lower yourself to the floor, stopping as your elbows reach a 90-degree bend. Keep your body from touching the floor. <br>  <br>  Step3 Exhale and push yourself away from the floor. Don't lock your elbows, and don't bend your back. <br>  <br>  Step4 Repeat several sets. <br>  <br>  Hope these helped!|`|YdaMAMiDaa	find your fav. tv show, and get a bag of chips and plant you ut butt in a recliner and enjoy.<br>  Being healthy was something of the 90's, get with the times.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	this link shows your how to do a pushup|`|71wBNgbnaa	You keep your body as straight as possible, toes down on the ground, and your biceps should become parallel to the floor at the lowest point of the push upp. A good rule of thumb is to make sure your elbows form a 90 degree angle when you go down, and that you come straight up. <br>  <br>  It also helps to exhale as you go down, as that helps your body to bear more weight. A lot of people have a bad habit of holding their breath when doing any type of weight-bearing exercise, and that just makes it more difficult. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped. :)|`|mdO8Z0XTaa	when i was in school they made you take a yarn ball, and everytime you did a push up your chin would have to touch the ball.<br>  BTW your elbows have to be at a 90 degree angle.|`|m1DuVX9Qaa	That's one way, but real men do push ups with one hand until your nipples touch the floor, count by thirds and take a break every fifty or so.

AG9msdUDaa	Hamstring stretch on wall: Lie on your back with your buttocks close to a doorway, and extend your legs straight out in front of you along the floor. Raise the injured leg and rest it against the wall next to the door frame. Your other leg should extend through the doorway. You should feel a stretch in the back of your thigh. Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times.<br>  <br>  Standing calf stretch: Facing a wall, put your hands against the wall at about eye level.

NI8pKCEpaa	No, infact if your young 9-14 or so u should do push ups to gain muscle. if u wieght lift and do stuff like bench press you could stunt your growth when your young. but to build muscle u usually want to give ur muscles a day break in between. so u might want to do 50 pushups every other day to allow your muscles to build.

Normally, skin tags grow very slowly to a specific size, up to ? inch long (1.27 cm), and then cease growing. A tumor that appears to be a skin tag, but grows rapidly and consistently, may be another kind of tumor that is malignant and possibly cancerous.<br>  <br>  Although unattractive, skin tags are harmless growths that appear mostly on adults beginning in middle age. Skin tags more commonly affect women than men. Skin tags are formed when an area of the outer layer of skin begins to overgrow and envelope collagen fibers, a type of skin cell that is firm and lacks elasticity.|`|VHi7Kaokaa	your rude.|`|pYpXj7gOaa	dark coloring around the neck is a sign of high cholestoral or high blood pressure, usually overweight people have this.

Yes you probably are addicted to porn if you look at it for "hours at a time", but the human mind likes to replay memories, especially fond memories. <br>  <br>  Your mind does the same thing when you watch a regular movie that you really like. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to stop watching porn for a while and see how you feel. If you can't get the images out of your mind and feel "compelled" to watch porn, then yes indeed you probably have an addiction problem and should seek help.

I know this is long, but it is important you should go over some of these facts<br>  <br>  Circumcision:<br>  <br>  pros: <br>  -less time spent in the shower cleaning it<br>  <br>  cons: <br>  -the initial surgery is going to be EXTREMELY painful, imagine just getting kicked in the balls and multiply that pain by two fold.<br>  -when you get circumcised they cut off your frenelum. The frenelum is one of the most sensitive spots of an uncut dick, holding millions of nerve cells. So when you get circumcised, they take away the extra good feeling you get when you have sex or masturbate.<br>  -As years go by after your surgery, your penis will only get rougher and harder like sand, creating an extra layer of skin, because there is no foreskin to protect it, Not only that, you will begin to lose sensitivity as well.<br>  -now i have no source on this but i heard that circumcised penises are a bit uncomfortable for the ladies because it dries them out faster (which is a bad thing). i'd do a google search on that though, to verify.<br>  -It is very hard to find insurance that covers the circumcision of the penis. <br>  <br>  Keeping your foreskin is more beneficial to you than removing it nowadays. In the current people have showers and indoor plumbing to keep their p*enis clean on an everyday basis. Whereas in old times, sanitation was often an issue, leading to foreskin being an issue as not many people would be able to clean their penises, leading to infection<br>  <br>  they say that foreskin has a higher rate of infection in comparison to a cut p*enis but that is a common misconception. Most of the times girls get infected by an uncut p*enis is because the man doesn't bother to take the time to clean it. As long as you clean it, you should be safe.<br>  <br>  i hope my facts have better informed you on the subject and hope you make a good decision. That foreskin you have on your genitals is a beneficial blessing.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|AA11170501	im cut and i have not seen any difference apart from the obvious  threes no 4 skin<br>  as for losing any thing you don't believe me i know<br>  <br>  as for restoring it its not worth it i got allot of trouble when i tried to do it i got all the old problems that made me get cut in the 1st place, so i have been cut twice.|`|GdJTQX6raa	if suggested by any surgeon for the reason that foreskin is not re-tracking fully during sex then circumcise . mostly people in the Muslim nation do this.advantage will be hygiene and the bulb loses its sensitivity. during intercourse sensitivity plays very much important to the final climax. it has advantage and disadvantage as well.|`|23HS8B9waa	circumcision is unnatural..<br>  hiv thing is bullshit, makes you look bigger is bullshit, cleaner is bullshit<br>  <br>  with a circumcision you'll lose sensitivity and thus sexual satifaction, now not ever being circ myself i wouldn't know but a lot of studies report that un men have much more ease at marturbating and enjoyng sex.<br>  <br>  don't risk making a mistake you'll regret, that reconstruction thing may work, but it'll never be the same.|`|o6o4KiBOaa	Im pretty sure it'll hurt less for whatever reason and if you masturbate it'll probably feel better and you can be cleaner down there.

FgPZ8Sl8aa	People can get mentally addicted to anything...jobs, computers/internet, video games, TV, sex, gambling, etc. Marijuana is considerably less addicting than caffeine in the physical sense.<br>  <br>  When people are "addicted" to marijuana it's because they are psychologically addicted to it (aka, no self-control) just like gambling and the other examples I mentioned. They get addicted to the way it feels because it's enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Only 17% of people who are admitted for marijuana treatment did so voluntarily and 70% are legally coerced into treatment. <br>  <br>  The question is flawed because often times people drink and smoke for different reasons. Alcohol is more considered the "social lubricant" type substance whereas marijuana is often used for a completely different feeling.<br>  <br>  As far as the reason people might get addicted, well, alcohol is physically addicting so if a person gets addicted they might drink to satisfy their bodies withdrawal symptoms. But, in my opinion, to become addicted to it in the first place you would most likely be having problems in your life that you are trying to escape. Addiction is more about the person than the substance.<br>  <br>  I can drink responsibly (though I rarely drink) and I'm not addicted. I smoke weed very often, but do so in a responsible manner and I don't prioritize getting high before any responsibility in my life.|`|AFObCLvZaa	First let me say you cant get get addicted to marijuana. However alcohol is on a totally different level. Usually people drink alcohol when they are depressed, when they are celebrating, and sometimes people drink alcohol for different reasons. alcohol is bad it rots your insides and makes you skin red and greasy. but marijuana isn't bad for people and in fact i have reason to believe it is good for people, now there are plenty substances that could be labeled as worst then alcohol like meth or crack. and i believe people use things like these when they are sad, upset, bored, happy, sometimes they just use drugs and alcohol to just "try it" and get addicted. basically i have never used any drugs so i am not speaking from experience but i have tried alcohol and am not an alcoholic (didn't much like the stuff). anyway there are many reasons people could do stuff like drugs or alcohol so it depends on the person.|`|9744rip4aa	a bad woman|`|iAPHAAinaa	This is a very simple question that requires a very complex answer. It could be a variety of things. The most common is ignorance; they don't really know what they're getting themselves into, so when their friend says "yo smoke this/drink this" they just do. Other reasons could be societal/peer pressure. Hollywood glorifies weed and alcohol with movies like "How High," "College," "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle," etc. Also, some addictions (especially alcohol) can be hereditary, where you can be more prone to it than others. And, like you say, weed definitely is an addiction; not physical, but definitely psychological. When somebody smokes weed, there entire lifestyle changes. Once they adapt to that lifestyle, it's very hard to break. Furthermore, the THC from weed (the stuff that gets you high) builds up in the synapses between the nerves, which is why all your reflexes are slow when you're stoned (the nerve signals aren't as receptive as they could be), and your body gets used to this which is why the psychological addiction develops (you need more and more of the drug to get the same high you used to). So, moral of the story is, there are many many paths to addiction but if you know your stuff than it is very easy to avoid.|`|75c1e9ed951c35dab63d980a369a16c5aa	addictions
6blfbeTGaa	Eh. It depends. If you've had your period then probably. You probably only have an  inch or two left. But it's hard to say. Everybody is different. Most girls have 2 or 3 growth spurts before their period and then after they get it their growing slows down.  You don't stop growing until you are 18, and you reach full maturity by the time you are 21.  Make sure to eat healthy b/c if you don't, you might come out shorter than what you are supposed to.  I know I have been growing a lot recently and I'm 15 and have my period for 2 years, but it's not like a growth spurt or anything I've grown maybe like an inch since September which is pretty good.  For some reason though, I think shorter people stay short while taller ppl just keep getting taller. This is just something I've noticed though, it's not proven or anyhting I think. But, you aren't really short or tall, more like in the middle so I think you should keep growing. And hte exercise is just healthy for you in general.  Ground sports make your bones stronger, which COULD make them grow but IDK....But that is my best advice. Ask your doctor.

It's a disease that can give you cervical cancer (and genital warts) , but there are many types and there's a vaccine (called Gardasil) that can prevent (not cure) cervical cancer.  Keep up with those PAP Smears and Good Job not having sex anymore.   Hope things go better....|`|ELyVXI9laa	yes you can get them, if you don't already have them. HPV, like Herpes lies dormant in your body and presents itself in the form of warts whenever it wants.

If you do test positive, it's not the end of the world, but it is hard to understand why it happened to you.  The thing doctors don't tell their patients is that close to 70% of the time, someones body will actually fight of HPV, and you will no longer have it.  You could be a carrier (like I was) I didn't have any warts, but had it in my bloodstream.  I have now tested clear of HPV for 3 years in a row.  However, the other 30% do have to live with it.  Talk to your doctor about all of this.  It is very important that your boyfriend was honest with you.  I had just started dating my boyfriend when I found out, we hadn't had sex yet, but he didn't break up with me or anything, he was very polite, and we've now been together 6 years and he did not catch it from me, and we didn't use protection.|`|IKUrjzucaa	******* ew, yes you can get them1!

Some women with HPV have no symptoms and are just 'carriers'-it's only in the bloodstream.  Also, 70% of all HPV clears itself naturally because your body can sometimes fight it off.|`|x0yeJ0yIaa	Yes more than likely you have it as well.

For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones.

Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health.

However, it is important to understand that despite the large role genes may play in your height, what truly matters in the end is the type of lifestyle you choose to maintain.<br>  Diet can make all the difference in the world- a case study showed that youth that snacked regularly on processed (not-fresh) or commonly called junk foods did not develop quite as well and to their maximum potential as did those who constantly stuck the age-old fruits and vegetables course regardless of how well endowed the parents may be.<br>  Also, in reply to the working out comment, it totally depends on what form of exercise you choose to participate in. If you prefer to build muscles with extreme amounts of weightlifting...etc., you will become shorter, stockier and somewhat compact as a way for your body to balance out the stress you are putting on it. On the other hand, if you take part in sports that work every muscle moderately, such as regulated periods of swim, soccer, track or even better, a mix of various, you will not only stay healthy but also lose weight, be happier and jumpstart your body's metabolism which in turn contributes to body processes that may help with your height.<br>  Don't be discouraged by the comments or actions of others. It is completely normal for development to be extremely irregular, though, I have to add:<br>  5'10 is absolutely no small feat to laugh or smirk at.<br>  Overall, in the entire world average, you are pretty well off. Too tall would serve to intimidate or outcast and too short would quite obviously result in underestimation. In the end, personality/attitude makes all the difference.<br>  Hope this helped.<br>  Good luck! :]

Sure you can find 1 hour every day.<br>  I recommend to take whey protein gainers every week(they aren't cheap but they are the best) and work out hard. If you don't work out or take too much you will only get fat since your body won't convert the extra intake into muscles but fat. 1 week won't be enough, find 1-2 hours a day and hit the gym or buy some weights and do it at home. <br>  You also have to check your diet for maximum effect. Without a good diet the whole workout will be for nothing.<br>  Consult a professional.

iK3YYRaTaa	As soon , None. Later can convert fat. But heres the low down on eggs.<br>  <br>  Eggs actually decrease cholesterol levels because the lecithin found in egg yolks emulsifies [washes like soap] cholesterol. Also the yolks contain choline, which converts into acetylcholine in your brain. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in memory, learning and cognition. Do you ever wonder why so many people of all ages have memory problems these days? Maybe its because they’ve been throwing away their egg yolks and avoiding fats. Eat your egg yolks. THROW AWAY YOUR EGG BEATERS; THEY ARE MADE WITH VEGETABLE CORN OIL, PLASTIC AND OTHER TOXIC INGREDIENTS – IN LABE RATS, EGG BEATERS CAUSED CANCER. Remember your brain is 60% fat and your spinal chord is 80% fat. DON’T CUT FAT OUT OF YOUR DIET – CUT THE MARGARINE OUT OF YOUR DIET.<br>  . ? Purchase free-range, grass fed meats, poultry and wild game. Vote with your pocketbooks. Support farmers who treat their animals humanly, by letting them roam, feeding them hay in the winter and grass in the spring and summer. Support these farmers, who do not give their herds hormones to fatten them up, or antibiotics, which end up in your milk and your meat, and in YOUR body. Industry raised beef and poultry are contained in tight quarters, they are given antibiotics because they get lots of infections and are given hormones to fatten them up. Folks, these hormones end up in your steak. Do we need to wonder why there is so much cancer in our society? Eliminate or greatly reduce intake of milk. If you must drink milk, use whole milk only from grass fed cows. Skim milk is used to fatten up pigs because it contains 12 grams of sugar. Skim milk does not contain fat. Therefore vitamin A and D cannot be absorbed and protein cannot be absorbed. Fat-soluble vitamins can only be absorbed in the presence of bile acids. Bile acids are made from cholesterol, only made in the presence of fat. So if you are drinking skim milk for your bones, you are actually losing bone.|`|Vjem5OJhaa	Eggs have a glycemic index of zero.<br>  <br>  They do not raise blood sugar levels.|`|6etaFOnhaa	zero. somebody very close to me is a diabetic<br>  <br>  look for nick jonas for inspiration. even if you hate his singing, he is a really good person. please never say you hate him, because he is what gets many diabetics through a tough day.|`|1PLFUli0aa	an egg has no carbs, therefore it won't effect your blood sugar likes sugar would. no sugar in eggs.|`|AA10450066	A whole egg has protein and cholesterol but no sugar.|`|X9NlytpLaa	None.

93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	Well, how I go about finding a Physician in a new city is to contact my health insurance and get a list of Physicians from them. This helps to ensure that the Physician in question takes your insurance. Then if you have friends  in the area ask questions, ask who they go to and who has been good to them. Then see if that physician is on your insurance. Or simply start calling around to see if the Physician is accepting new patients.<br>  <br>  Now your Physician who retired probably had someone who took his practice over. So, if you know who that is, you can try contacting that Physician for your records and usually they can be mailed or faxed over to your new Physician, you will have to fill out some paper work to have that done however.<br>  <br>  If you can't do that then ask your new Physician what they recommend. It is not a huge deal if you don't have your old records unless you have some chronic condition.

Try P90X along with like 20 minutes of cardio 4-5 times a week, that will definitely get you lean.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  P90X is a very intense program. You have to pass a fitness test that you are given so that you know if you are capable of doing the P90X regime. <br>  <br>  The P90X program is very expensive and I suggest that you start out doing something not as intense.

It takes great discipline to do it every day though. If you want to start slimmin down, jog/run about 25 -30 min a day 4-5 days a week, you'll drop about 2-3 lbs a week. With that said technically speaking you will lose about 20-30 lbs in about 2 months in a half but keep in mind you have to increase your intensity and listen to your body if your sore, take a day off.

The ideas of progressive overload only really work if you have a large amount of weights available. However, you can certainly do some intense home workouts, which will probably be more endurance based:-<br>  In the gym, to work out the chest, one would do bench press and related pressing exercises.  At home, with no barbell you can use pressups, and when these become too easy progress to variations, such as raising ur legs onto a bench so there is more weight on your arms. You can do clap press ups which will increase the explosive strength in your shoulders triceps and chest.<br>  Legs in the gym would typically be worked with squats and leg press exercises.  At home, bodyweight squats are a good replacement, moving onto jump squats, weights squats (with whatever weights you have) and weighted jump squats. You will not be able to do the traditional 10reps to failure as you would with heavy weights in the gym, but you will build strength and also endurance and some size will come as a result.<br>  There are loads of bodyweight variations of weighted gym exercises, you just have to be creative.<br>  I would suggest sessions done as circuits, where you do a set number of reps/time on each exercise and then move onto the next, repeating the whole circuit a number of times. Search you tube for the Bodyweight 500 - this is a really good workout, promoting strength and endurance.|`|fecUjSr1aa	being a gym rat, I'd say that you cannot get the same impact as those people working out in the gym. there are so many exercises and equipment you can use at the gym in order to make that impact you are talking about. however, you do have limitations, like not being able to afford the fees and that's not so good so ... i offer you an alternative ... still interested? read on ..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.getirongym.com/Default.asp?tcode=asp3&bhcp=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.getirongym.com/Default.asp?tc...</a><br>  <br>  this is an iron gym equipment and its easy to use and put away, all you gotta do is hook it on your door frame and ... voila .. instant gym. it comes with some instructions that would allow you to perform several exercise, that if done frequently, might give you some significant "impact" and "beef" you up somewhat.<br>  <br>  and you can also incorporate what you are already doing with your dumbbells. so don't let that setback stop you and keep up your workouts .. they're good for you.<br>  <br>  you can afford $30.00, right? ok so make it about $35 including shipping and handling <br>  <br>  i got one of this .. and it works great ...|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I find it easier and way more sanitary to work out at home.

AG9msdUDaa	That is a rough situation. There are a couple of things you can do as some food allergies actually look like schizophrenia but are not. Remove any and all artificial sweeteners from your diet and stop drinking coffee. With a coffee allergy, depending on the severity, it can take a full year for the traces to leave your brain so you really have to be committed on avoiding caffeine like the plague. Also, you could be low on vitamin B12 which can happen if you are a celiac and are unaware of this because you are not able to absorb this vitamin due to intestinal damage. You can find a sublingual version in health food stores. If you can afford to get your doctor to do a general metabolic profile for you and give you your actual results and the scale they compare it to. You should be mid range to actually be ok. Results that are too high or too low are going to effect your health, but docotrs say you are 'fine' even in those cases simply because you cannot die from your excess or deficiency, but you sure won't feel good at all. Also get an allergy test done and remove all foods you show sensitivity to. Start exercising as well, the more intense the better, even if it is just dancing alone in your room every day for an hour. Taking probiotics also helps you to absorb nutrients from food better so you can start taking those anytime. Hopefully, this will either get rid of your symptoms entirely or at least reduce them if it was the correct diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Quote from souce:<br>  In the vast majority of cases, schizophrenia is an acute psychospiritual crisis which has usually been triggered by a traumatic life conflict. However, the following physical conditions can also trigger psychotic disturbances:<br>  Cerebral allergies, Vitamin B-3 and B-6 dependencies, vitamin deficiencies (e.g. scurvy, pellagra), EFA deficiencies, mineral (e.g. zinc) deficiencies, toxic reactions to (e.g.) lead, or drugs (including psychiatric drugs), LSD, marijuana and other hallucinogens, infections such as rheumatic fever, syphilis, food allergies (e.g. to milk).<br>  <br>  Withdrawing Safely from Toxic Psychiatric 'Medications':<br>  <br>  Reference Source: Patients Rights Advocacy Waikato Inc.: Resource Handbook, 5th ed., Hamilton, NZ, 2001<br>  <br>  Gradual withdrawal is preferable, since it allows for slow re-adjustment and reduces withdrawal cramps. Withdrawal symptoms may last 35 days after you have finished taking tablets, for every year you took 'medication'.<br>  <br>  Use the 10% Formula. Gradually reduce drug intake in 10% steps, taking as long as required. It may take months to withdraw completely.<br>  Example: Reduce by 10% at each step, e.g. 500mg dosage (per day) minus 10% =<br>  450mg/day. Take a week or longer, until free of withdrawal symptoms.<br>  Step Two: Go from 450 to 400mg/day and wait a week, or until you feel OK.<br>  Step Three: Go from 400mg to 350mg/day and so on, until you have completely withdrawn from drugs. It is easier to reduce a morning tablet first.<br>  <br>  Restoring Normal pH:<br>  <br>  Your body pH, or level of acidity, should be 7. If your body pH is acidic (less than 7), you will need to drink 'Cal-Mag' formula (an anti-drug) until your pH returns to normal.

You are probably a lot more capable of controlling yourself then you are willing to admit. Be positive. If you feel a problem coming on take a break from the situation you are in.

Nordic European people who have consumed milk as part of their diet in their ancestry may have better tolerance to cow’s milk, than those people whose ancestry was not exposed to that kind of milk as in Asia or Africa. Southern European with a long history of alcohol consumption are more tolerant of alcohol than people for whom alcohol was never part in the hereditary diet, such as Australian aborigines.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, this natural diet has to take into account quirks of inborn genetic disorders such as gluten intolerance as in coeliac disease, Crohn's Disease, or Ulcerative Colitis.. These may well be hidden behind the mask of hypoglycemic symptoms.<br>  The best plan is to ask yourself what diet your ancestors ate and you don’t even have to go back to very ancient times; think of your grand-parents.<br>  Probably the hypoglycemic diet differs from the natural diet in that the number of snack per day are increased.<br>  <br>  In brief the nutritional treatment of the hypoglycemic condition consists of:<br>  <br>  1) Avoidance of sugar, coffee, strong tea, nicotine if possible, refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, white rice, cakes and sugary drinks, candy bars, colas, cookies, ice cream sweetish fruits such as bananas, grapefruit, melons, honey and dates (these fruits may be reintroduced at a later stage in moderation) etc.<br>  2) High protein + complex carbohydrates snacks every three hours or sooner, to provide a slow release of glucose, and to prevent the hypoglycemic dip. A high protein breakfast must be considered the most important meal of the day. Good sources of proteins are eggs, white meat as in chicken and fish. Eat plenty of green vegetables and fruits and the more varied the diet the better it is.<br>  3) Supplementation of diet with Anti-stress vitamin B-Complex tablets, including vitamin B6, B3, B12, chromium picolinate, magnesium, zinc + Vitamin C, and fishoil (omega-3 fatty acids).<br>  4) Other supplements that could slow down the absorption of glucose (thereby avoiding blood sugar peaks and the release of stress hormones) are: Psyllium Seeds Husks (1 tbsp per day), Glucomannan including pectin (follow instructions on bottle), Grapefruit and Cinnamon. Also see “Herbs with Hypoglycemic Effects “ at: Research Evidence for Hypoglycemia. <br>  <br>  The Hypoglycemic diet aims at normalizing blood sugar levels, thereby normalizing stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, that are thought to be responsible for the symptoms of mood-swings, depression, anxiety, phobias, alcoholism and drug-addiction.<br>  Such a diet needs to be adjusted to the individual needs and nutritional biochemistry. It needs to take into account the influence of allergies.<br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb ask yourself: “Is what I am eating nature-made of man-made?” Nature-made food consists of complex carbohydrates and proteins, the kind of food we were meant to eat. <br>  Try to introduce the diet slowly and gradually. A strict hypoglycemic diet may cause you to feel worst at first, because your are left with low blood sugar levels. This would last a week or so. These symptoms can be alleviated by taking a tablespoon of GLYCERINE mixed in milk or in a diluted natural fruit juice three times day. GLYCERINE is metabolized in the liver before it is converted to “energy”, so it does not stimulate excess insulin secretion from the pancreas. An other alternative sweetener is FRUCTOSE, which is also metabolized in the liver into glucose. But excess fructose will be converted to triglycerides.<br>  When introducing a new diet we must always consider possible allergies. Many hypoglycemics have hidden allergies, that is after having been on the hypoglycemic diet for some time they discover that they are allergic to certain food items. These were there all the time, but were masked by hypoglycemic symptoms. Finding your Allergies. <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor to give you a B12 injection as most hypoglycemic are deficient in this vitamin.<br>  <br>  The Hypoglycemic Diet should not be regarded as a ‘quick fix diet’. It takes time for the body to adjust to a different nutritional lifestyle. Time is needed to absorb and metabolize nutrients to be converted to neurotransmitters, enzymes and coenzymes, and to rebuild receptors for natural neuro chemicals.<br>  <br>  Most people may experience the benefits of the hypoglycemic diet after about three months. If you have been using drugs of any kind, it may take even longer. Some studies have suggested that receptors for neurotransmitters may be repaired some 9 to 14 months after abstinence from the drug(s). Volkov ND et als, 2001<br>  <br>  Withdrawal of drugs should always be under the supervision of your doctor.|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	I assume you mean a diet that lowers your blood glucose levels. You want to watch your carbs. Carbs are converted into sugar. Obviously you want to watch the extremely sugary foods too.|`|TsjqzanQaa	When I was first diagnosed as hypoglycemic, I followed the diet reccommended by the dietician in the hospital where I worked.<br>  <br>  I put on weight, I felt and looked miserable.<br>  <br>  I now just eat more protein foods and less sugar, and this is what works for me; we are all different.<br>  <br>  I now use artificial sweeteners in my coffee, tea and iced tea, and have cut back on all sugar, in general.<br>  <br>  The body metabolizes protein into a more stable form of blood sugar, which minimizes the hypoglycemic reaction of the pancreas.<br>  <br>  Sugar stimulates the pancreas of the hypoglycemic individual to overproduce insulin, which drives the blood sugar level even lower.      That's why protein helps to maintain a more stable blood sugar level, and sugar in the diet should be minimized.

I was busy all last summer and only had a chance to go swimming once, and totally regretted it! I know everyone says you shouldn't change to impress someone and the truth is that they are right, but if you are uncomfortable with yourself, it is important that you become comfortable with yourself! So here is my advice but remember that since you are a guy it is acceptable to be hairy. Okay: you can shave your chest in the shower (my fiance has a hairy chest and he shaves it for me no problem), girls love the happy trails, but if yours is super hairy, maybe trim it a tiny bit. And I don't think you need to do anything about the leg hair (my fiance has hairy legs and I love it lol) and about the back hair..swim one time and if the reaction is bad, wax it, but if the reaction isn't bad, don't wax it! Oh and to help you out a little bit more, if it is too scratchy after you shave there is Nair for men, which is a cream you leave on for a little bit, and then you just wash it off no problem and the hair is gone! Vuala!|`|xG1CUaipaa	def. dont shave... Honestly I know you wont like the sound of this but go to the salon and get it waxed. maybe not your legs cause bald legs might look gay on a guy... but your back and shoulders and chest, for sure<br>  <br>  It only hurts the first time i promise!!<br>  <br>  <br>  otherwise, just accept that your hairy. BUt i would recommend secretly getting it waxed|`|kEI2BmNZaa	My nephew has a very hairy back.  In fact, I never noticed it until we went swimming after he got out of Navy bootcamp.  He was unable to shave his back for like 2 months.  I found out later that during his high school years, his sisters were shaving his back the whole time.  Now that he is a regular Navy guy and out of bootcamp, he gets his friends that are girls to wax it off with Nads.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|VZVMQcWcaa	Don't worry about it, it's just the way you are!<br>  If you want then you could get it waxed or you can just except that that's the way you are  . . .<br>  Your choice!|`|45mYmiUUaa	dude i wouldnt worry about it too much. the only part that sounds potentially bad is your back and maybe you could wax that or something. the fact that your have hairy legs and chest and stuff is no big deal|`|VJGiB87qaa	show them hairs of be proud of what you have hay I am 15 and all I all most have soft hair ever wear I am going to be hairy and proud|`|dTzYFKcMaa	this is a common problem among both males and females (though perhaps not to that extent for the 'gentler sex')<br>  there is no need to forsake your fun and life- talk to your parents and family, even if they may not offer too much advice or help. It is always better to communicate and understand each other rather then relying on only a single perspective for judgment.<br>  Most people shave or wax the obviously revealed or problem areas and leave the rest alone. Keep in mind that if you DO shave, it will grow back thicker and faster, so it would probably be most convenient to keep a razor at hand. As for waxing, it is often painful , but lasts longer and does not have any irritating side effects such as a wait period for hair to fully grow out before shaving again, red itchy areas or painful irritation of hairs as they began to appear again.<br>  I would personally recommend waxing for shoulder, chest, upper body (since it lasts longer and does not look like you have ants on your skin when it grows back) and shaving for the more tender areas if you really wanted to.<br>  Hopefully this helped!<br>  Good luck :]

AA10744471	Of course, eating in moderation really helps you become more healthy <br>  and disciplined in taking in food for health and nutrition of your body.<br>  <br>  With self-will, we can train ourselves to eat till we are just half full and still meet our nutritional needs.<br>  <br>  EAT in moderation. Or, eat till you are only 50% to 70% full. These are common guidelines for healthy eating. <br>  <br>  How do we cultivate the habit of eating in moderation? Can our stomach gauge the amount we need?<br>  <br>  In Asia, rice is often taken as a staple. If chicken, albeit cooked in different ways, is your only source of protein for the whole week, you would be consuming chicken excessively, in terms of frequency. Plan your weekly menu so that you have two days of meat, two days of fish, two days of egg, tofu or other vegetarian dishes, and perhaps leave one day to satisfy your cravings. <br>  <br>  Take a look at your weekly lunch. If fried noodles, deep-fried fish, potato chips, spring rolls, fried bean-curd sheet, goreng pisang or other fried dishes are your favourite dishes, you are eating fried food excessively. <br>  <br>  Deep-fried food is undeniably tasty. It has high calories due to the absorbed oil. It may also have toxic residues if the oil has been reused many times. <br>  <br>  Eat moderately and have variety by including foods that are steamed, grilled, baked, boiled, poached, fried or raw.|`|4CsGde1qaa	Eating in moderation helps and you know it, wouldn't you. But what kind of help are you expecting? You did not state, so answering this question, it will take me some assumption. eating in moderation helps the digestive tract take in the feed you eat even with little fiber. Also, you won't feel hungry all the time, but that doesn't mean you won't get cravings, cravings are different from hunger. benefits also include regulating your metabolism and promoting a functional liver. About being healthy?, no, eating in moderation can be healthy in a few ways, but it is just one of the many ways to become and maintain a healthy lifestyle. No one can live healthy, look where we live in. Just make sure you include lots of your favorite foods, unless you are on a diet. About your sugar-free issue, just enjoy it. If you need sugar, try Splenda w/ Fiber, and anything else that has labled, sugar free." I hope I helped you in the most helpful of ways.<br>  PS: Try answering my question on the source provided.|`|7gDeqlfnaa	So diabetes is the case huh? What is moderation in eating? I eat fine, not healthy fine 100%, but sugar free just like you. I have no diabetes, but I am sugar free too. Am I happy, of course yes! Eat what you want, eat big, but work hard and do it right! On your toes and let the sweet tooth dreamer continue his doing!<br>  PS: Just so you know, you can't possibly avoid sugar no matter what you do. Sugar is a nutrient and used for energy. Without sugar, how will your metabolism get energy besides from carbohydrates. Caffeine maybe, but are you going all the way with it?<br>  PS: Sugar is in almost every food we eat and it comes disguised in many names, here is a list I made for you, Why?, Because you a friend, and friends do this:<br>  sucrose <br>  fructose <br>  glucose <br>  dextrose <br>  galactose <br>  lactose <br>  maltose <br>  invert sugar <br>  raw sugar <br>  turbinado sugar <br>  brown sugar <br>  confectioner's sugar <br>  granulated sugar <br>  corn syrup <br>  high-fructose corn syrup <br>  honey <br>  maple syrup <br>  molasses|`|iK3YYRaTaa	Without Exercise moderation is of no avail.

Balance is the key.<br>  The traditional Chinese diet is lots of veggies, a little meat, all day long. (When welcomed into a chinese home, the host/hostess will ask "have you eaten yet?")<br>  Spanish/European eat small meals all day long and into the night, starting with a light snack at day break, breakfast at 10, lunch at 1 or 2, another meal at 5 or 6, and dinner at 9 or later before bed.<br>  The Italian diet also calls for many meals throughout the day.<br>  American diets are the worst, having the heaviest meal at the end of the day. <br>  Most sensible diets, start out with you having smaller portions more often.<br>  If you were living in the "wild" you would only eat what you had gathered, as it was gathered.|`|IZvbv5ONaa	There is no such thing as eating sh-t in moderation.<br>  <br>  Don't ever eat hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup.<br>  <br>  If you have diabetes or  food allergies.  These are all examples of situations where there is no space for moderation.  Certain diseases like diabetes can make you excessively hungry when you are not supposed to be hungry at all.<br>  <br>  I have been relatively slender most of my life.  I have done lots of exercise and whenever I am hungry I thought that it was right for me to eat.  When I first started getting my first symptoms of diabetes,  I would have a huge breakfast THREE times!  My blood sugar must have been so high, I could not even remember doing this.  I would go back to the same restaurant three times.  I only knew because I had the credit card bill and people told me I was doing this!!<br>  <br>  At one point, I put on 30 lbs in just one month!|`|98eqHnaGaa	Eating in moderation certainly does help but it also depends on what you eat.   Cut down on carbohydrates and sugar as much as possible.   If you really crave for the sweetness, go for synthetic sugar.   A sensible diet coupled with eating moderately will definitely improve your health.

They produced a striking and gratifying improvement in health levels and well-being. Also of greatest importance was the fact that they were found to be instrumental in lowering the cholesterol content of the blood and in reducing the amount of harmful blood fats.<br>  <br>  The five-step program. Here are the five steps that patients were asked to follow:<br>  <br>  1. Include daily as a food supplement at breakfast two to four tablespoonfuls of Lecithin extracted from soya beans.<br>  <br>  2. Add to your diet each day B complex vitamins in the most potent form. Avoid the cheaper preparations which provide only small and ineffectual quantities of the vitamins, and have little or no effect on the body. Your doctor or druggist can advise you which brands provide potent quantities of the vitamins.<br>  <br>  3. Also add to your daily diet at least 25,000 units of Vitamin A, and 150 mg. of vitamin C.<br>  <br>  4. Take two tablespoonfuls of soya bean oil, corn oil or safflower oil daily to provide the essential fatty acid necessary to proper nutrition. The oil may be used as salad dressing, taken with tomato or fruit juice, or in any way you prefer.<br>  <br>  5. Include in your diet two to four tablespoonfuls of whole wheat germ each day. This may be eaten as a breakfast cereal with fruit, or sprinkled in your salad.|`|0nyWiro9aa	Coronary risk assessment is ascertained by taking into account clinical aspects like a family history of CAD, diabetes, renal failure, activity level, smoking etc. There are also laboratory risk factors which take into account LDL and HDL. One changes what they can (exercise, medication )and prayes for the rest (genetics). The high HDL and lowered LDL is what we all strive for. Is that enough?<br>  <br>  There is no one single best answer or single large risk factor that outweighs all the others. There are expanded lipids panels such as the VAP that breaks lipid down into more risk factors not normally tested for. Some people get heart attacks with normal LDL cholesterol levels and such cases can be detected from such panels. The treatment is still basically the same but the risk is better assigned by such panels.<br>  <br>  The treatments all involve statins and until better treatment modalities can be found then we have to continue to evaluate the benefit risk ratio taking a statin. There is still some contention involved with primary prevention studies and some argue they don't do much in terms of preventing in large numbers heart disease cases. They argue that the absolute number of cases are small (absolute risk prevention is small)  The company argues the relative risk prevention is higher. In reality the number it benefits are fewer than the large number of people taking them. That is due to the imprecise predictive nature of who will it benefit the most from them. We use a shotgun approach to treating all.<br>  Until there are better predictors on who would benefit the most, then one is stuck with millions of people being on statins. <br>  <br>  I think few would argue against a person having an outrageous cholesterol of being on a statin. In order to ascertain the overal risk then consider having a VAP test done along with ascertaining a family history of early deaths to due heart disease etc.

fPOg9DuXaa	First of all, you know it's a sinus infection if you tip your head forward and there's a lot pressure and pain in your upper nose area. <br>  <br>  For a sinus infection, this is what works for me: <br>  1) A heat pad to your upper nose, between the eyes area (if you don't have a heat pad, you can wet a washrag with warm water) <br>  2) Drink lots and lots of water (or gatorade with electrolites). This will thin out the mucus and make everything flow better<br>   3) Take some kind of aspirin/ sinus infection medicine to reduce swelling of nasal area <br>  4) A saline nasal spray (this is like salt water). You can either buy a saline nasal spray or make your own. Look it up to find the exact ratio of salt/ water (you don't want it too salty- it will dry out your nose). This sounds gross, but the basic idea behind the nasal spray for sinus infections is that it will go in through your nose and out through your mouth. This will clear out some of the passages that are blocked. <br>  I hope you feel better!|`|vnJG8UYJaa	Okay, it is gross.  The very best way to deal with this, and this is gross too, is to stand in a warm to hot shower and actually inhale the water through your nose.  This will thin the mucous and make it easier for you to get rid of.  Run a humidifier in your home.<br>  <br>  Start taking some Vitamin C.  I take 2000 mg a day when I am sick like this.  It will give you some relief and build up your immune system.  It will also give you some energy.  <br>  <br>  If it is actually infection, you will probably need some antibiotics to get rid of it.|`|U4ek1lCLaa	Neti pot works wonders|`|e7NA8S9Laa	find a doctor!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You can't although mucinex does help with some of that.|`|vOukAHowaa	It is not a sinus infection unless u are blowing out yellow/green ect<br>  I have had one for ,get this, 3 stinking months!!!!!

ro1yMxZ9aa	Literally speaking, inflammation means setting on fire. <br>  <br>   Inflammation can develop in any part of the body, including the eyes and their surrounding structures. <br>  <br>  Inflammation is a characteristic reaction of tissue to injury or disease.  Inflammation results from the body’s attempt to eliminate a foreign body or germ and helps to prevent further injury.  <br>  <br>  Inflammation is marked by four signs: swelling, redness, heat, and pain.  You have probably observed the signs of inflammation in a cut or burn on your hand.  <br>  <br>  Inflammation is a complex process involving many different kinds of white blood cells:  granulocytes (neutrophils, basophile, and eosoniphils) and some immune specific white blood cells called B and T lymphocytes along with their antibodies and cytokines. In all inflammatory diseases there is the migration of these specific types of white blood cells out of the bloodstream into surrounding tissues. These cells release agents (chemicals), such as cytokines, to boost immune responses and kill invading bacteria, viruses, and parasites or anything that the immune system perceives as foreign (antigen), or non-self.  Part of their response is bringing antibodies (proteins in the family of immunoglobulins) to the site; the antibodies then attach to antigens and mark them for death.  Antigens are anything that the immune system recognizes as non-self or foreign and, therefore, trigger an immune response.   The linking of the antibody to the antigen forms an immune complex. Immune complexes circulate through the blood.  Usually they are removed quickly, but occasionally they are lodged into tissues and cause inflammation. <br>  <br>  Normal healthy tissue can be injured by inflammation during this process (innocent bystander injury).

n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|9pLI73pqaa	My doctor suggested the plan on my source web site.

A5ctEDmvaa	You asked three questions so here goes.<br>  -----------------------------<br>  Regarding butt workouts:<br>  1) Get on hands and knees. Extend one leg backwards and up. Do the movement slowly. At the top of the movement flex your butt and upper legs. This will target your gluts (butt) and hamstrings (back of things). Both help the back of your legs look more sculpted.  Do this exercise 25 times on each leg, breathing out as your lift your leg up. Switch to the other leg and repeat. Do both sides 4 times. If you don't feel any burn (meaning you are pretty fit already) get some of those ankle weights at a fitness store. This also helps work your abs on the sides a little bit and your back (for general core strength). Do this every day.<br>  <br>  Jogging will also help to build strength in all those parts of your body. See below.<br>  <br>  ---------------------------------<br>  Regarding Abs:<br>  1) Lie on ground and bend your knees at about a 45 degree angle. Putting your toes against a wall helps keep you from moving. Put your hands together on your chest at about the spot where your ribs come together above your stomach. Do 25 crunches straight up. Crunches are not complete sit-ups. Just get your shoulders all the way off the ground. Keep your head back, otherwise you will start lifting with your back, which is not what you want to do. This one targets your upper abs. (top part of the "six pack").<br>  <br>  Take a 1-2 minute break.<br>  <br>  2) Same position but lift your legs up off the ground and cross them at your ankles. This will be harder! Do 25 crunches again with your hands in the same position. Don't give up. The burn is your muscles tearing a little bit and then getting stronger (more toned). This one hits your lower abs (bottom part of the "six pack" and a bit lower down).<br>  <br>  Take another 1-2 minute break<br>  <br>  3) Now put your legs back at the 45 degree angle. This last one will hit the sides of your abs. First put your hands behind your neck. Remember to keep your head back. Lift your left shoulder towards your right knee. Remember to use your stomach to do the lifting. You'll be able to feel if you are using your back. Then go back to the ground. Lift the right shoulder towards the left knee. That is one. Do it 25 times. This will hit the sides of your abdominal muscles (left and right of your stomach. It helps tone up those muscles that are under the "love handles" and even help mask them a bit if you start to build up the size of those muscles.<br>  <br>  I recommend doing this every other day for 2 weeks. Then start doing it every day. It will seriously burn/hurt the next day at first. That is normal and it means you are making those muscles work hard and tone up. After a while you should start feeling stronger. Start doing it every day. Once you can do it every day you can either add more sets to tone faster (currently doing 3 sets, with 25 reps each) or more reps to build up a little more muscle mass (don't worry you won't turn into a female body builder).<br>  <br>  -------------------------------------<br>  Regarding the boobs getting smaller:<br>  1) I'm a guy (Disclosure) so I can't speak from personal experience but from my understanding of anatomy that part of your body is partly fat, partly muscle and partly "breast" tissue (the stuff that stores fluid for a kid). <br>  <br>  The fat will start to go as you lose weight, but the rest will stay. Unless you get really serious about weight training the muscle will not get a lot bigger and the other tissue will basically stay the same except from normal maturing of your body. <br>  <br>  Your concern suggests you may want to lose some weight at the same time as you gain some muscle tone. They are accomplished by different types of exercise. Depending on your age you may need to accept a little bit of 'baby fat' in order to stay healthy. I hate to offer any specific advice about how much to lose without knowing what your body mass index is and your age. Remember to be realistic and forgiving of your personal appearance as you start to exercise. The types of disorders that we all hear about (and see friends suffer from) are easier to get caught up in than we might like to admit.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest asking your doctor for some advice the next time you go in. Explain your goal of losing a little weight to show off the muscle tone you've been working on. See what they say is a healthy amount of weight to lose, if any. We've all got a range of healthy weight that we can work within.<br>  <br>  That said, to cut down fat you need to do aerobic exercise. Running/jogging is great. 30 minutes per day with an average heart rate of 130 beats per minute will start to really burn some calories for you. Don't worry if you don't know how to figure your hear beat or if its exactly 130 beats per minute. Link below on a good way to start jogging.|`|RbY08OoFaa	Well excercise that you could do at home includes sit ups, press ups, running up and down the stairs, ur boobs wont go smaller unless u start losing dangerous amounts of weight|`|87699ab1ce2025108e4e32e4cb62c9e6aa	i got abs by putting my tredmill on a high incline when running and it kept my boobs the same size and now i have a four pack its awesome:p|`|lcuxD3qlaa	If you do the bike, it won't get small<br>  <br>  Hey!

Sorry if you like them, but they will send flab straight to your stomach (and probably everywhere else, too)! You should probably even avoid juices altogether. <br>  Drinking water is better. I took up karate and although I was thin beforehand, by the time I had a bit of karate training, I was toned all over! If you don't want to actually commit to a sport you can try to commit to: <br>  -Sit-ups. I know everyone says them, but through karate, I did loads and they really do help. <br>  -Suck in your stomach muscles whenever you remember to. Even if you're just sitting there. It is better than doing nothing. <br>  -Improve your posture by standing up straight all the time, and sucking in your stomach. Over time, you will stand up better and your stoach will look smaller because you are standing so well. <br>  -Clench your stomach muscles tightly for about 10 seconds. If you do this, like, 50 times in an hour, this is good news and should help. <br>  -Exercise before breakfast, because it will use fat that is already stored. It is better than exercicsing after a meal, because the body will just the energy from that meal without reducing the fat that's already stored!<br>  -Avoid food like potato cakes, or any fried food. I work in hospitality at the moment and I have seen too many girls make the same mistake of eating a potato cake or hot chips for lunch. This does you absolutely NO favours. Trust me on this one. <br>  -On days when you don't even feel like exercising, go shopping. It doesn't feel like much, but constantly walking around a shopping centre burns fat, which means that it won't go to your stomach!<br>  -If you live with your parents or another guardian who cooks for you, ask them to reduce your portion when they put the food on your plate. <br>  <br>  There are other ab exercises, you just have to look in a fitness magazines or on the net. Speaking of fitness magazines, read them! Many people argue that they do nothing for your self-esteem, and they probably don't but they are EXCELLENT for giving you motivation. You will see stomachs that can break wood, so to speak, and you will feel a detemination to become even a little bit like them! Even cut out pictures of women with a stomach that you like from a magazine and although they are generally an unrealistic ideal, it's great to get motivated to lose the flab. Fitness magazines also have many ideas and tips to help you. <br>  <br>  As for your breasts, exercise could make them perkier! Perkier, tighter breasts are better than untoned, saggy ones! When exercising, do not worry about your breasts one bit! Even if they get a bit smaller (and it will be just a bit), the shape of the rest of your body will be so rewarding. In my opinion it is better to be tight and toned all over with smaller breasts, than have the bigger breasts but be untoned everywhere else. <br>  <br>  Good luck <br>  Good luck :)

The researchers found that neither antiperspirants nor deodorants increased breast cancer risk.<br>  <br>  These links give some facts:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/myths/antipersp.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/myths/a...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cancer-causes/CA00085" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cancer-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=3943" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/defaul...</a><br>  <br>  Those who claim that deodorants/antiperspirants cause breast cancer state one of these three things as the reason:<br>  <br>  1) they contain aluminium; many do but there is no strong evidence that aluminium could increase the risk of cancer <br>  <br>  2) 'anti-perspirants prevent the release of toxins, which cause cancer'; this is nonsense - the purpose of sweat is to cool you down, not release 'toxins', and even if sweat did release toxins, there are plenty of other areas you sweat profusely from.<br>  <br>  3) they contain parabens, a preservative many believe is linked to breast cancer. - There is in fact no evidence that parabens cause cancer; the concern arises from a small study in 2004 by British researchers which found traces of parabens in tissue taken from women with breast cancer. The tumours of 20 women were tested, and for obvious reasons there was no control group.<br>  <br>  The researchers claimed the study demonstrated that if people are exposed to parabens , the chemicals will accumulate in their bodies <br>  <br>  However, this extremely small study doesn't demonstrate a direct causal link between deodorant or antiperspirant use and developing breast cancer. A study that small cannot be regarded as proof.<br>  <br>  There are many deodorants available without parabens and aluminium, and many people choose to use them to be on the safe side - I do myself, and did long before my breast cancer diagnosis - but there is no proof of a link with breast cancer or with any other cancer|`|zlQo7WMoaa	.In 2002, the results of a study looking for a relationship between breast cancer and underarm antiperspirants/deodorants were reported. This study did not show any increased risk for breast cancer in women who reported using an underarm antiperspirant or deodorant. The results also showed no increased breast cancer risk for women who reported using a blade (nonelectric) razor and an underarm antiperspirant or deodorant, or for women who reported using an underarm antiperspirant or deodorant within 1 hour of shaving with a blade razor. These conclusions were based on interviews with 813 women with breast cancer and 793 women with no history of breast cancer.<br>  <br>  Findings from a different study examining the frequency of underarm shaving and antiperspirant/deodorant use among 437 breast cancer survivors were released in 2003 (7). This study found that the age of breast cancer diagnosis was significantly earlier in women who used these products and shaved their underarms more frequently. Furthermore, women who began both of these underarm hygiene habits before 16 years of age were diagnosed with breast cancer at an earlier age than those who began these habits later. While these results suggest that underarm shaving with the use of antiperspirants/deodorants may be related to breast cancer, it does not demonstrate a conclusive link between these underarm hygiene habits and breast cancer.<br>  <br>  In 2006, researchers examined antiperspirant use and other factors among 54 women with breast cancer and 50 women without breast cancer. The study found no association between antiperspirant use and the risk of breast cancer; however, family history and the use of oral contraceptives were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (8).<br>  <br>  Because studies of antiperspirants and deodorants and breast cancer have provided conflicting results, additional research is needed to investigate this relationship and other factors that may be involved.

IMPvzBk1aa	You may have developed a salivary gland infection called parotitis.  One version of parotitis is the disease known as mumps.  I think you should contact your doctor since this could lead to other complications like development of salivary stones (sialoliths) if it is parotitis.  Also, if it has spread to the salivary glands, it could spread to other tissues, and you don't know whether it is viral or bacterial at this point.

I think yours is persistent enough and painful enough that you need to get a chest xray and probably some blood work... so you need to see your doctor.  Don't put this off as you could be in the early stage of a serious lung problem or (less likely) a heart problem.  An occasional irregular heart beat is normal, especially  if you drink caffeinated beverages.   I suspect it is not terribly serious but do not recommend ignoring it.   I hope this helps.|`|t1zlbOURaa	See a doctor immediately.<br>  <br>  That said, I had similar pain, went to a doctor, did a stress test, and found out that it was nothing. Went to a chiropractor, found out that I had a rib out of place.<br>  <br>  Now I either get regular massage to loosen the muscles that pull my rib out of place, hot tub time, and more exercise. It's no longer a problem.|`|A9MDoFooaa	i'd get checked out by the doctor asap if i were you.<br>  <br>  the docs would rather prescribe an antacid or similar than miss a patient with a heart problem..|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	see a doctor hun, it could be nothing, but better be sure
AA11780840	Sounds like he has a food allergy. He should see a pediatrician.<br>  Benedryl for children<br>  <br>  Or athletes foot. Scrub the tub more  and keep his feet clean and clean fresh cotton socks not barefoot!  Get athletes foot spray or cream for his feet.<br>  <br>  But take the kid tto the doctor. He could have a food allergy. <br>  Good luck|`|AA11924441	sounds like an allergy to me...is there something he eats before this happens?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://symptoms.wrongdiagnosis.com/cosymptoms/itchy-feet-in-children/red-and-swollen-lips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://symptoms.wrongdiagnosis.com/cosym...</a><br>  <br>  he should go get an allergy test done before his reactions get worse .<br>  <br>  look at what he eats before the reaction on those days.|`|n1D90COxaa	Yes he should see a doctor, the foot itch may be related to athletes foot, which can be very painful, it can be cured with a prescription medicine, as the over the counter stuff isn't really effective. The swollen lip may also be related to a fungal disease as is the athletes foot.
xmibEEdcaa	Inflammation of the lining of your lung isn't pneumonia, although it can sometimes be a side effect of pneumonia.  It's called pleurisy, and it's often, although not always, a symptom of some other problem with your lungs.  It's nasty and can be very painful - you have my sympathies.<br>  <br>  If you also have walking pneumonia, then it's probably connected to that. Did the doctor you saw put you on a round of antibiotics? When the pneumonia's cleared up, the pleurisy will probably go away as well.<br>  <br>  You can read more about pleurisy here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-pleurisy-basics" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/under...</a>|`|m5AN26Voaa	OMG i feel so bad and i had the same prob sry

RXI8ImdIaa	You're going to have to go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  It's likely to be a yeast infection, but you need a real diagnosis. If it makes you more comfortable, you can request to see a female doctor if your normal doctor is a man. <br>  <br>  If you're too embarrassed to talk to your parents, just tell them you need the doctor and it's rather person so you'd prefer not to talk about it. Believe me they'll figure out that you are probably talking about a yeast infection but at least you don't have to say it that way.<br>  <br>  Suck it up, and just do it - you need to get used to dealing with any health issues in your reproductive system, it's something every woman must go through and it's not all that bad.<br>  <br>  No I'm not being mean, I'm telling the truth ;)   guys have their own problems too you know, and I've been through that sort of thing myself.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	you might have a yeast infection but I would talk to your mom and see a doctor|`|8ZPchcEgaa	You could have any number of infections and it's a bad idea to try and treat them on your own. You don't need to have sex to get an std. Are you counting oral as sex? It could just be a yeast infection, a common problem for women that has nothing to do with sex. GO TO A DOCTOR! Better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to an area as sensitive as this.
8R0v4yOyaa	think of it this way, would you rather be known as "that girl with braces" or "that girl with haggard-*** teeth?" <br>  <br>  it's not a big deal at all. tons of people have braces in high school, and the only ones who get made fun of are the ones who pout about it. after a few weeks you won't even notice them and neither will anyone else. if they bother somebody, they aren't worth your time. <br>  <br>  thinking back to high school, a lot of the girls with braces actually looked pretty cute with them. it's all how you carry yourself.<br>  <br>  i'm in college and i have still have em. don't bother me any, don't bother anybody else. i know plenty of people my age with too and it doesn't bother them at all. it's all good. <br>  <br>  keep your head up and you're fine.|`|DK3zY3mkaa	im getting my braces tomorrow, and im in 8th grade. there are many people who have braces these days, so dont worry. i visited the high school im going to (open house), and big surprise! many people have braces. its just a relaxed and chilll place.<br>  <br>  and if they do tease you dont mind them, at least you'll have a killer smile (:|`|sZMa0s7Baa	SO many kids have braces until like half-way through sophomore year or the beginning of junior year. I had to have mine from the summer before sophomore until the summer before senior so it's not so bad!!! Just do it I didn't want to at ALL but you will love your straight teeth.|`|pl6Mh5K1aa	Freshman year isn't so bad, I used to see a lot of freshman girls with braces in my high school, just think positive they should be off by your junior and senor years and that's what really matters in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  Its even worse to get them after 18, get them now and have that perfect smile on prom night.|`|zAN9JV4kaa	almost everyone has or had braces in my school so not having them is weird. plus no one really makes fun of something that will make you pretty. you can almost always find someone "popular" in school with braces so don't worry. and you wont just be "fine" after your braces you'll have a gorgeous smile.|`|eHidj8pcaa	Trust me, no one's gonna make fun of you. Soo many kids have these days. I got mine in grade 5 and had them for 3 years.. And I was even popular! And I find braces really cool.. I miss mine. :(  The only downside is having food in your teeth, so just bring a tooth brush to school and brush your teeth at lunch. :)  <br>  And won't you be happy when you take them off and your teeth nice and straight? <br>  Trust me, it's worth it. <br>  And i betcha you'll miss them after you get them off.. I do.|`|5GcmU8gNaa	u should not be worried im getting braces in 3-4 months. Im in year 7 so that means im 11 years old. You mite set a trend i suggest you get coloured 1s people mite like them. Dont be ungreatful be glad u r gettin them.|`|d442bb19c50d42a1e21f5b79e0056189aa	Take my advice. Do it now while you don't have to pay!! I waited and waited and before I knew it I was 18 and still hadn't gone through with it even though my dentist kept suggesting it would be for the best. So at 24 I finally was able to save to do it for myself land I had to put out $4,500 to get my teeth fixed!  So you think 14-15 is bad try being a 24 year old in braces. Not many people to confide in! lol<br>  <br>  But I have no regrets. I just got them off 2 weeks ago and I could not be more happier with my decision. Braces are a piece of cake and trust me nobody will care that you have them on but you! So don't let it get to you. Lots of highschool students have braces. Your not alone. <br>  <br>  Just remember to do what our ortho ask and the better job you do the faster you'll be done and it's a life long investment for a healthy smile!

Check with ur dr, they can do a simple blood test to check of anemia.|`|6j9Lb83Caa	well these symptoms may very well be your low blood pressure not getting any better, which you should see your primary about. Another thing is, is that some symptoms of anemia are paleness, a dark ring around your eyes for no apparant reason. and thats all i really recall other then nautia out of the blue, but you should really check in with your primary and maybe they could take some blood samples youll get results probablly within a few weeks after this|`|5MTFXnGfaa	look up vertigo symptoms. i had vertigo and that happened to me|`|uhTMdZeVaa	Could be dehydration or low blood pressure.

This sounds different, but to check, see if it is a lot worse without eating, and take some vitamins and see if it gets better.

6NA2MXNPaa	I guess it's only us nurses that drink them every day, lol. I've been drinking one a day, used to be two a day, for many years and I'm still alive and doing well (knock on wood). I guess it depends on which ones you drink. You have to be careful of how much guarana and other herbs you're taking in. You also need to be careful that the herbs aren't going to clash with some other prescription medication that you're taking. There shouldn't be a problem with it though. The ones I drink are called X-Drinks, they're made by XTC in Redmond, WA. I've recently found NOS drinks, which I love, but they are too potent to drink too often. I say cheers, drink up!|`|7qTKREOmaa	I wouldn't reccommend it. You can become dependant on it and there have been studies that show that too much caffeine is bad for your heart.|`|yotafojtaa	The only harm it could do is give you a caffeine addiction (this happened to me and I got the shakes if i hadn't had one for a day!) and also they contain a lot of sugar, which isn't healthy.<br>  You'll begin to grow dependent on them, so it's recommended not to drink them every day - maybe one or two a week max.|`|Oxh13RaGaa	Depends on what energy drink---there is a new healthy one out there called Blu Frog----go to loveblu.com and check it out.  You can only buy it on the internet.

I am a a nurse and I drink one every day--feel great!
ugW9r4gRaa	I recommend three things: A hot shower, a cup of coffee, and an energy drink, in that order. A hot shower will generally wake you up somewhat, and following that up with a cup of coffee to sustain it and energy drink to give it a final big boost should do the trick.

RXI8ImdIaa	Simplex 1 is generally considered an above the belt infection, and simplex 2 is below. However both of the strains can be spread to both locations. <br>  <br>  The herpes lesions are extremely contagious, both to yourself and to other people. If you are getting the sores in new places, you've probably spread the virus by touching the sore and then other skin areas. You could also have been reinfected, such as by kissing a partner and transferring the virus to them, then getting infected back again by that partner, just as an example.<br>  <br>  It is possible to give the cold sores to someone in their genital area as well, so stay away from sexual activity while you have an outbreak to be safe.|`|ho0JgShXaa	cold soars come from herpes simplex 1,once you have them your probly stuck for life with them,so being sexually active has nothing to do with it,and if you have no genital soars then your fine.|`|0011Smdtaa	It is really really important when you have coldsores [ herpes simplex 1] to not kiss anybody on the lips and do not have any form of oral sex as this will pass it downstairs and then you will have herpes simplex 2 to contend with as well.  A general rule of thumb is as soon as you feel the tingle of a coldsore coming on do not use your mouth for any form of sexual entertainment....  Always wash your hands thoroughly if you touch your coldsores.  These things hurt like hell down below - so avoid at all costs.|`|AA10169678	All herpes infections are highly contagious.<br>  HSV1 and HSV2 can occur anywhere.

In the UK, you can make your own doctors appointment and go alone at the age of 16. Don't know about in America, but I'm guessing it's the same once your over 16. Or if you need an STD test you could go to a Family Planning or Brook clinic for that, a lot of places you don't even need an appointment I think. If you Google "STD check" or something you can probably find out more. Good luck!|`|3255bf9a56942506a066812fff721579aa	No, you're at the age where you should be getting these checkups anyway.

EXq2QYqOaa	The side effects of BC vary from woman to woman. Some women have weight gain/lose, some BC wreaks havoc on your skin, some makes you sick, etc. you need to see a doctor so they can know your medical history and meet your medicinal needs.<br>  <br>  You could go to a free clinic or a Planned Parenthood to see if they could get you some. But, you're going to eventually have to get a pap smear etc. before you can take BC constantly. If they don't give you one, then they are potentially putting your life in danger because you could have some unseen problems with your reproductive system.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you could always get condoms if you wan BC for sexual reasons.|`|sJUCJO7Waa	I think you can where I live (Texas), but you need money.  I know some girls gain weight but don't take the morning after pill it is like performing an abortion yourself.|`|557nSJb1aa	There's a good chance you can. There are OTC birth control methods, so you could go to a store alone and check the family planning aisle. Another option (if you have insurance and some money) is to go to the doctor and get a prescription for birth control. Then go to the pharmacy and get your prescription. <br>  <br>  Side effects of BC can be weight gain/loss, lighter/shorter periods, no period, more regular periods, higher risk of ectopic pregnancy, and some other things. It varies depending on what BC you use. A good way to find out is ask your doctor or read the information that comes with the birth control.<br>  <br>  The person who said taking map is like giving yourself an abortion is wrong. MAP (the morning after pill) is basically just a higher dose of regular birth control. It does not end a pregnancy (you aren't pregnant until the fertilized egg implants, map is taken to prevent that) so there is no abortion (abortion ends the pregnancy).|`|eRX96A73aa	If you go to a woman's clinic in your area like Planned Parenthood, they can get you on birth control without your parents knowing.<br>  Some side effects are gaining weight, being tired, shorter and lighter periods. Some rare but possible side effects are blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks. <br>  Talk to the doctor at the clinic and she will determine which one is best for you.<br>  Good luck!|`|GwEEEyNRaa	If you and your mom are the least bit close, now would be the best time to have a woman-to-woman chat with her.  Find out how she feels about b/c - she may shock you by supporting you!  But if you're not close, just a word of advice: it's better to use an effective form of b/c than to create an unwanted pregnancy.  Also, sex between two people who really care for each other is a beautiful thing.  If he's pressuring you & he's young, don't feel you have to have sex just to keep him.  That's not love, it's just sex.  Good luck kid!|`|y2eZnL0Zaa	I think that u gain a little weight and there could be blood clots but blood clots are unlikly

iZqSEQQsaa	Pap smears are a completely different form of testing from blood tests. Pap smears are done in the vaginal area (cervix). They take the samples and put them in petri dishes occasionally with an added substance to bring about certain results. They leave it for a determined amount of time then analyze the cells in the growth that occurs in the petri dish to determine positive or negative reactions/results. <br>  Blood test are generally done primarily for HIV testing and occasionally for some strains of chlamydia and herpes. They are also used sometimes as a more early detection for risks with certain cancer that effect the reproductive organs, cervix, etc.. But generally you have to request these tests. Places like planned parenthood usually only do HIV and certain chlamydia blood work tests upon request.|`|0iJSa2c1aa	None. They do a swab of your vagina. No blood is taken.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	papsmear is exfoliative cytology. checking for abnormal cells mostly for cancer. interestingly, Pap Smears can detect lung cancer though we usually think of them for cervical cancer|`|bbn2YvrKaa	They don't necessarily run any blood tests for a pap smear. However you usually get a physical done at the same time and sometimes they take blood for that. <br>  <br>  Depends on your medical and family medical history, but "normal" blood tests would be a complete blood count, possibly cholesterol levels, electrolytes, etc.|`|tr21QsNcaa	Sounds like you are afraid ? No blood test at all, they take a swab of your vagina to remove some cells, place them onto a slide and view them to see if you have any STD's or any form of abnormalities. Abstinence is best and if that will not happen always use a condom for intercorse and a barrier for oral.  Good luck|`|GwEEEyNRaa	Blood tests?  A pap test doesn't involve any blood work; a gynecologist takes a small scraping of the cells at the cervix & checks them under a microscope.
ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	Talk to your health care provider. They may want to give you a mild blood thinner or something as simple as taking an aspirin. Get up once an hour and walk around.

emGF1hZ9aa	I always change my pad while I'm sitting on the toilet.<br>  <br>  I've leaked on my underwear before, but as long as it doesn't get on your pants it's not too bad. If it does leak on your underwear, make sure to take them off as soon as you can and soak them in cold water with some detergent to get the blood out. If that doesn't work, you can use Spray N Wash or some other leave-in laundry treatment before you wash them.<br>  <br>  I haven't had many problems with leakage for years now though, because I use tampons. I like Playtex Gentle Glide, because they insert easily, and work well.

Leaking's normal, as long as it's kept to a minimum. If you experience leaking often, it is a sign you are using the wrong absorbency for your flow and you should begin using a higher absorbency pad immediately.

Get it checked out and you will be better in no time.|`|1hxlQyTwaa	You may have Crohnes Disease or Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

Hawkins work). As long as you are identified with the body you are mostly a karmic winded up doll.So you can stop worrying about when you are going to die. Now things like cancer and other health problems does not equal death since they can just be karmic debt you are paying off. The funny thing is that the way you do die is up to you, which to me is true and makes me laugh. <br>  <br>   A few years ago there was an airplane whose emergency door somehow broke  and opened, and only 1 person out of those 300+ people got sucked out. That was a stewardess. Most people would go into sympathy but we do not know that really was going on. It happened to be her time.<br>  <br>   The question you are asking is funny because you are asking about the signs. If you are born a human you are going to die. It's not a sad thing but a fact of life.<br>  <br>   On a serious note, most people who are nearing there death usually report how peacefull and more benign they seem to become. Of course, that is not always the case because there are people out there that just hate things like love,caring and integrity. And will be that way until their death LOL .

AA11676888	Easiest diet in the world. Drink eight glasses (8 oz each) of water a day. No less. Every day. Not only will it make you healther, more beautiful, and live longer, but it will curb your appitite. Need something flavored? Drink tea, not soda. And for the love of god, DON'T TOUCH ENERGY DRINKS. PERIOD. It's worse than cheeseburgers and candy bars. Don't do it. Eat salad instead of burgers, but don't smother it in dressing. A little bit will do. They sell them in sprays now. Love the salad, love the greens. I hate brusselsprouts, but I get lots of greens never the less. Peas, green beans, lettuce, spinach, etc are all good. LOVE THE SALAD. Meat in salad is okay, as long as it's grilled. Baked/breaded is good, but not as good as grilled.<br>  <br>  A common myth no a days is that you can't eat asian on a diet. That is kind of true. Any kind of cheap ramen, or chao mein you buy at the store is extremely unhealthy. Avoid it altogether. When buying asian, or any other food for that matter, including mexican, check the label. You would be suprised how bad it can get. Be careful. Your best bet is to go out when eating oriental, mexican, etc. because it's generally better. And when I say 'go out' I mean NO TAKEOUT. I mean a sitdown restaraunt is generally a good choice.  In fact, let's just eliminate take out completely, unless you are ordering a salad, or something you KNOW FOR A FACT is healty. Got doubts at a fast food restaraunt/take out? Don't buy. When it comes to takeout/fast food, stick with sushi, salad, etc.<br>  <br>  The biggest mistake women make when trying to lose weight is that they starve themselves. This makes you heaver, fatter, and more irritable. Eat till you are full, but make it healthy food! Don't watch your portions, watch the content! (Let me say this again. CUT FAT, NOT FOOD. EAT FOOD UNTIL YOU ARE FULL!!!!!!!! JUST MAKE IT GOOD FOOD!) When snacking, because this is where weight comes in the most, choose something healthy! Cherries, roasted almonds or other nuts, fruits, celery sticks in peanut butter, etc. Water though, is my favorite modification to this, and is the most effective. See something yummy when you pass the doughnut shop? Reach for something on your person. Always keep a healthy food alternative on your person at ALL TIMES. And if by chance you don't? Pull out gum =D. Gum works as an emergency backup plan. But avoid it if you have something else. Rice cakes are good, carrot sticks are awesome, and remember that peanut butter and honey are 100x better than caramel or cream cheese for flavoring. When making sandwiches, in fact, when thinking of ppj, cut out jelly. Just make peanut butter. Not pizzazy enough for you? Toast the bread. =D Yummmmmmm. (By the way, when making sandwhiches or toast, use WHEAT bread. No white. White bread is horrible for you, compared to the benifits of wheat. You don't have to go to whole wheat, because it doesn't taste very good. But honey wheat, which is a bit dilluted but still good, is wonderful.)<br>  <br>  Yogurt is conriversial. Yogurt, as a general, is good for you. However, some brands can be decieving and actually be so sugary and fatty it's bad for you. My rule of thumb is to stick with Yoplait Light, or better yet, get plain yogurt and flavor it yourself with blueberries, strawberries, etc.<br>  <br>  Organic doesn't mean weight loss. Organic is wonderful for you, but organic sugar and organic chocolate is still bad. Worlds better than regular, but not good.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely need a drink with sugar, under no circumstances get diet drinks, because they have fake sugar in them. I don't care what Splenda says, all fake sugar is at least twice as fattening as regular. But remember, sugar is still sugar, even if it is better than fake sugar. Also, I will stress this again, if you drink something other than water, it doesn't count as water. The only way you can drink something that isn't straight water and it still count as 8 glasses if it's flavored with tea bags or if it's got some kool-aid or something in them. When doing Kool-Aid, make sure it's the low sugar kind. Anything else is NOT WATER. (Or at least it doesn't count.<br>  <br>  Also, don't do slimfast. No need, doesn't work, tastes like crap.<br>  <br>  And another thing, DO NOT CUT CALORIES!!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO IT, NO MATTER WHO SAYS IT! I ACTUALLY GAINED WEIGHT WHEN DOING THAT! People say to do that, but it's not right. Calories are the energy you good from food. And while it is true that fattier foods have more calories, and that they do contribute to fat gain, don't go calorie hunting. Look for fat, and sugar. Another mistake people make about looking for less fat foods, is that they look at Total Fat. Don't be one of these people! Look for trans, monosaturated, poly unsaturated. You would be suprised how many people reach for debbie cakes, look at the calories, and assume it's good for them. Sugar does the same. Now i'm not saying don't put flavoring in your water, or don't make Kool-Aid. That's actually a good idea. But don't eat foods high in sugar! Cut almost all of it out! Mixed drinks, however, though they do contain sugar, are good good good good. Whatever keeps you off of soda. Just be careful how much sugar it contains. When drinking tea, drink natural tea. Even if it has sugar and honey, it's still good for you. Though you need to remember that tea your brew yourself is best. Another huge mistake people make is that they drink ICED tea thinking it's good for them because it's TEA. Now, iced tea is a whole world better than soda, but it's the worst kind of tea for you. Focus on Green, Red, and Black tea. These teas are excellent for you. Most people don't like the taste, however. Buy packets of flavored tea to make, such as pomgranate, orange spice, peppermint, rasberry, etc. Yummy! Still not sweet enough? Put in a few drops of honey! And remember to check tea that's mixed for you, because sometimes it can be just as bad as soda. Look for glass bottles, they usually indicate someone who isn't too coporate yet. The more organic, the better, not because of organics, but because it means the tea is more likely to be all natural, with no perservatives or corn syrup. Remember, Soda, Coffee, and especially energy drinks are forbidden. Candy Bars, protein bars, energy bars, forbidden. (Though bars made of mixed nuts and fruit is fine =D) Doritos and Lays? Forbidden.  Also, cut down on Sodium, because it sucks the water right out of you. And 8 glasses of water should be in you by the end of the day. Again, it curbs hunger, makes you look great, and detoxes your body. =D<br>  <br>  Excercise is important, but so many people do it wrong! Want to walk or run? Consider this: To lose any weight by doing an excersise, you must do continous movement for more than twenty minutes. After the twenty, you burn DIRECTLY from fat. So it's better to walk twenty minutes then run ten.  It doesn't matter what you do in particular, but do something simple that won't frustrate you or tire you too easy. Don't stop, most of all. Listen to music, it helps. Do this everyday when possible (and when I say 'possible' I mean when you have no other option but not do it.) no matter what your excuse is. Love yourself!<br>  <br>  Good luck! Best wishes to you!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. Crazy diets don't work!!!!!! They don't!!!!! I promise.<br>  <br>  P.S.S. And for the love of Jesus, don't get surgery! I'd rather be fat. Gastric bypass is hell, tummy tucks come with complications, liposuction leaves your skin looking ugly, and anything else is stupid. Diet pills, however, is the stupidiest, most idiotic and damaging thing you can do to your body. DO NOT DO IT.<br>  <br>  P.S.S.S. The best tool in losing weight is self control. Be aware, don't waver, and most of all, remind yourself everyday that you are doing it, and why. For instance, have a friend tell you how you are doing. Motivation is the key. Tell you what. Do this for a month straight, everything I have said, then I garantee you 100% that the number of guys that check you out a day will AT LEAST double. When I had weight problems, never had a single girl even turn their head toward me. Now it's the opposite. =D|`|wZ2HrJeJaa	If you can't go to the gym and crazy diets, then it will take a while to slim down 30 pounds!<br>  <br>  Just find out the average calories you can take in each day and subtract 200-400 calories from that and try to keep up with that amount of calories daily.|`|6j9Lb83Caa	well if your not looking to put in a little extra effort to loose weight then you are going to continue being larger than you wish. Going to the gym and starting a diet would be the first thing you should look into doing. The second thing that you could do is start a diet at home eat a lot of greens and day by day lessen your fats in your foods, and then about 2 times a day at least you coan try to jog or walk around about a block or two maybe 30 minutes to an hour for the first month then an hour ect for the second month while you are walking or jogging what you can do to tighten your mussles and this may sound stupid is chew a pack of gum about 3 times and spit thats all you do is keep chewing a pack and keep spitting until the gum flavor goes away then start a new pack of gum. Of course when you get home brush your teeth. and another thing that you could do while doing your excersies at home you could do crunches starting at 5 for a week then go up by 5 every new week.|`|9cBAUMnNaa	Start walking. Just 20 minutes three times a week should help. Cut out soft drinks if you drink them, lower your portion size a little and eat more fiber and veggies. That would be a good start and just taking positive steps will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  My mother lost 40 pounds walking 2 miles every day for almost 6 months. She increased it over the course of time but that was all she changed. My brother lost over 80 pounds by stopping sodas and watching his portions, when that started working he began working out at home doing jump rope for cardio and simple weight training at home.|`|UJ1w74gdaa	ask your mom if you can go to your nearest YMCA, make out a stretch list and do that everyday and stick to a routine for sit ups and push ups, if you can't go to the YMCA try running around your neighborhood and listen to your mp3 player while you run, maybe even go with a friend after you get the hang of it|`|zZtAYBowaa	u cant hit the gym or diet huh!!!too lazy!!!well then get under the knife!!!But its gonna cost u a fortune and yeah u can alzo die because of complications!!!!So choose dear!!!gym/diet or surgery!!!!|`|M3hIKoNHaa	Weight gain is initially caused by having more calories in your body than you use. Calories are just energy, if you eat a lot you have a lot of energy in your body, you don't use that energy your body stores that energy on top of muscle as fat. Not eating will not help, when you don't eat it tells your body that food is scarce and so it goes into survival mode, saving each bit of energy and storing it as fat. Find out how many calories you need to just to live with this nifty tool <a href="http://nutrition.bizcalcs.com/Calculator.asp?Calc=Advanced-RMR" rel="nofollow">http://nutrition.bizcalcs.com/Calculator...</a> then eat as many calories as you need to live , plus a small snack or two in the middle of the day. Plan out your meals, if your dinner meals are cooked by parents and are normally calorie filled you can ask them to cut down on the calories or just count on that meal being full of calories and plan everything else around dinner. The snacks will keep your body out of survival mode while not overflowing your system with calories if you choose the right snack and portion. make this your daily routine and weight loss will begin.|`|AB6SKMnKaa	Jenny Craig! <br>  <br>  No, I'm just joking. I think the best you you could possibly do is to eat healthy food. Eat lots of green veggies, and meat. Drink tons of water. It'd be best if you gave up soda, that alone will help you lose weight. Don't even drink Diet Coke, because that still isn't good for you. You might want to start exercising, to help burn the fat. Try giving up as much sweets and junk food as you can.|`|czr4NgWbaa	You don't need to hit the gym. All you need to loose weight/ gain weight is all around you. the weather is beginning to get really nice, go for a jog! If you are too lazy to go outside, go do some sit-ups. <br>  <br>  Also, if you definitely are eating too much, cut down. <br>  <br>  But, let me warn you, the more you workout the more you will need to eat and drink. <br>  <br>  Here are your options:<br>  1) Eat all meals, but cut down a little. <br>  2) Sit-ups EACH and EVERYDAY! (100-200 a day) <br>  3) Run outside<br>  4) Pick up a sport<br>  5) Exercise!<br>  <br>  YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO A ******* GYM!

Don't eat anything that is naturally high in sugar like fruit and fruit juice, corn etc. Drink only bottled water. Eat very low or no-fat food. Don't eat late at night. Eat lots of veggies and drink veggie drinks (eg. V8) whenever you are hungry. Eat chicken breast for protein. DON'T STARVE YOURSELF.<br>  As far as exercise is concerned, walking long distances is a good start. Find a sport that you like and stick with it.

AekVyLneaa	Breath sounds:<br>  Crackles is usually fluid on the outside of the lungs.  What can cause this?  Congestive heart failure or renal failure. There are other causes of it but those are the 2 main causes.  <br>  Crackles can also be due to atelectasis (lung collapse).  When the lung collapses, they make a crackling sound when the individual inhales.<br>  <br>  Rhonchi is congestion in the lungs (AKA pneumonia).<br>  <br>  As a Resp therapist, I had a hard time distinguishing between the 2 while I was in school.  Either which way, whether you heard crackles or rhonchi, you definitely need to go to the hospital and get checked out before it gets worse.  I never like to jump on the "go to the hospital bandwagon."  So, this is one of those rare times, I will say please get checked out.  Better to be safe than sorry.

If you have too much acid in your stomach it's going to ache badly.If nothing works, since it's been this long it's time for the doctor to see what the problem is.There are other problems that can cause these symptoms that you might have to have blood work for.Hope you feel better soon and some of this helps.

AA10816009	I don't understand why your trainer is working you so hard that your heat beat is 150+.  Maybe try staying around 120-130? With all these ekgs, your doctor should tell you the best workout level.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	Are you mad?<br>  See a doctor!<br>  This is not something that can or should be diagnosed by Yahoos!<br>  Women are more often under-diagnosed for heart disease than men.<br>  ANY TIME there is chest pain, see a doctor ASAP!<br>  Better safe than sorry.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	150- 170 is very normal when you are working out. I am perfectly healthy and it is hard for me to keep mine below 162 ish. It also depends on your size. I am built small so that's normal for me. If your head is hurting, you should look at the exersizes that you are doing and try something with less impact. The way you breathe can aslo affect how you feel after working out!|`|Yi90xZgxaa	I have been working in cardiology for 6 years. You need to see someone. Maybe get a stress test. There could be a problem even with a normal EKG. Have them check you out, better safe than sorry.
AekVyLneaa	I don't know of any appropriate medical term for it but everywhere I have worked we called it "stacking treatments."  We cannot stay in every room from the time we start the treatment until it ends.  It can take about 15 minutes per treatment and sometimes we have 15 patients that are due every 4 hours.  So if you figure that out, it is about 4 hours and 15 minutes worth of treatments for all of those patients.  Plus we may have ER, OB, ICU, surgery, etc... So we have to stack treatments in order to ensure that everyone receives their treatments on time and that we are available for critical situations.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	It's simply called time saving. There are sooo many treatments to be done it is impractical to stay with each patient for the whole treatment. I used to do no more than 3 pts. at a time. That way I had time to evaluate each pt by listening to their chest, checking their Sat. and pulse rate and a general assessment of their respiratory status.Going on to the next one and do the same. After starting the second one i'd peek in on the first just to make sure and then on to the third. And of course somewhere in there got to talk to the patients about how they're feeling and such.<br>  I never knew there was an actual name given to it. I never saw the harm in it unless, of course, if the therapist abused it.
f8mLpPXlaa	I'm sorry but you said it was an indentation and then you said it was swollen. But the best thing for it is ice. that will keep the swelling down.

I don't remember what it is called.  It is fairly new and I don't see it advertised anymore.  Saying that, I have to say you are very young and this is part of your development.  You need your hormones to grow into a women: Hips, boobs and the whole package.  There are very serious risks going on the pill and unless you are sexually active, which I hope you are not at this age there isn't any reason to go on them.

2KC467tFaa	You probably look different already. Have you thought about taking pictures every week to compare and give yourself a boost? I think you can start seeing results in about 2 weeks, but you'll see huge results in about 6 weeks. I've heard it takes 6 weeks to build muscle (which uses the fat for energy). Try to be patient with it. Instead of looking so far ahead for the reward, try to feel the benefits when you're working out or right after. Finish your day knowing you did something good for yourself. Keep it up.|`|f2XhfAoIaa	WEll maybe your body is already at an appropriate weight and you are starting out at your peak which means it will be harder for you to lose weight. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water, eating healthy foods and I'm sure you will see some results within the next couple of weeks.|`|A9WCbC8aaa	I agree with Stephanie, take pictures of yourself now.  What that does is motivate you to not only lose the weight but keep it off.  I did this and took the same pics 30 days later...I will never be my "before" pic again.  Good Luck!

IMPvzBk1aa	Some forms are contagious.  Pneuomonia can be viral, bacterial, or caused by other microbes.  It can also result from aspiration (breathing in) of a chemical, or any foreign material such as food.  It can also be an allergic response.  So, until the cause is identified, maintaining isolation is not such a bad idea.  Also, with resistant strains of bacteria that are more and more prevalent, it is better to err on the side of caution.

Also according to traditional chinese medicine(tcm) the inside lower leg should not be stimulated during pregnancy, also around ankles and top of foot, if you have fluid problems or sore feet and legs, have a warm salt bath or roll your foot over a bottle or foot massager. remember the law of gravity, in tcm the spleen Meridian is responsible for things going up, the stomach meridian is its partner and its job is making this go down, so you vomit when stomach is too weak to keep it down, you get varicose veins and swollen ankles with a weak spleen meridian, also miscarriages and prolapses, going to bed with wet hair weakens your spleen it is the spleen meridians job to keep the baby up until ready. the traps and triceps are muscles associated with the spleen, so shoulder rolls are really good, i went swimming a lot and i loved it, keep your body balanced with swimming or tai chi or pregy yoga,, sweet is the flavour of the spleen, go for healthy sweets like honey,fruit,

Like others have said, it's personal preference. Some guys like to trim and keep the bush under control, others like to trim the top only and shave certain areas (like their balls) or the hair on their legs that's around the cock & balls. I myself like to trim the top & have smooth balls, it's not only more comfortable for me but also cleaner. Less or no hair down there, the less sweat and odor that gets trapped in it. You also have the guys that do it because of a sport or job they are involved in, like swimming, body building, modeling, posing, etc.  If you're thinking about doing it, just be assured that it's cool, there is nothing wrong about it or with you if you do. Hey, a plus for some guys who do trim and shave is that it makes their penis look a bit bigger.  :)|`|73GkepzFaa	When you first shave it becomes itchy and maybe slightly bumpy when growing hair back, it'll hurt the first few times but if you keep at it the skin will become used to it.

Good luck~|`|yLPZ7gkkaa	Just personal preference.<br>  theres nothing really WRONG with it,<br>  but I would think most people dont care about it at all, if they love you enough&&and are comfortable with you.<br>  and if someone DOES have a problem they'll eventually tell you as you grow closer.

ugW9r4gRaa	According to wikipedia, Adderall can have tremors as a side effect when you are overdosing. More common side effects seem to be nausea, dizziness, insomnia, digestion issues, and a loss of appetite. If your shaking is mild I would recommend contacting your doctor about it, perhaps a reduction in dosage is in order. If your shaking is more severe, though, it may be a sign that you should seek more immediate attention for the condition.|`|GzXDRRYLaa	ive heard of someone shaking on it but ive also heard of someone have a bad sideeffect seziure, so ck with your doc.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	i think its bad.  take less.|`|paduuGEraa	I shake when I'm on shrooms.

First of all he's a guy... so we don't always know what to say and when we do say it, it's more than likely not what should have been said or what was in our head.  I'm not saying that all men, but most men have this idea that all women are emotionally weak and easily become an emotional wreck.  I'm thinking this was an uncomfortable situation for both of you at the time, but I'm sure it was much more for him. Believe it or not most of us guys hate to see a girl cry and it's even worse when we are the ones who have caused the hurt, so to say. I think he was trying to be nice & supportive, although his thinking was "she's gonna be crushed after this" because like I said... some guys don't know think girls can handle things like this, hence his thoughts were that you would take this really hard. Now him being a guy and surely not knowing what words to say to you, thought that it would be nice to let you know that it'll be ok and that you should not let it bring you down. Plus you yourself said he was joking when he said that and then agreed with you and showed that he also cared saying it was a sad situation and it would affect him also.  I really do think that what he said at first, was a guys way of trying to bring his thoughts to words and screwing them up.|`|4LIbHFPpaa	Well, if you were a bit depressed he would see it as that you enjoyed time with him, and would miss it.

VWNiOxcvaa	Contacts are foreign objects in the eyes. The same thing happens to people relearning to see. Their eyes water and tear and burn in response to their contacts when the strain and tension of blurry vision habits is reduced. Blurry vision habits and strain and tension dull the sensitivity of the eyes and our brains learn to block this out.<br>  <br>  The strain and tension that accompanies glasses vs. the strain and tension of contacts are different, they each have their pros and cons.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	If you have burning while peeing directly after sex and continuing for a few days after then don't worry, this happens when the urethra is massaged and compressed during sex resulting in your urethra becoming swollen and sore. Thrusting and vaginal dryness can also cause small splits in your vulva which can cause pain when pee hits your vulva. If using condoms be aware sometimes you can be allergic to the condom or spermicide so you may want to try using a different brand or type of condom to find what works best for you and for the fun of having lots of sex to try them out. Chances are that you are just experiencing this rather than anything serious, so don't worry, as long as you keep clean and it doesn't get any worse over the next few days then you are fine.<br>  <br>  If the burning starts a day or so after sex then it's probably a urinary tract infection (UTI), this burns as you start peeing getting worse as you empty your bladder and can make you feel like you need to pee more often. This infection is common because women's urethra's are short so it's easier during sex for bacteria around your vagina and vulva to get into the urethra, thus why you pee after sex and wash genitals to flush bacteria out from your urethra. This infection occurs particularly when you have sex a lot or start having sex, although not a STI it can also be passed between partners so if you have reoccuring problems get your partner treated even if he has no symptoms. UTI's are easy to treat with antibiotics or with home methods such as drinking lots of water and unsweetened cranberry juice, also washing with warm salt water after peeing to clean and ease pain. These infections are normally quite harmless but if it carries on for a few days or gets worse then it's time to see a doctor as if left untreated the infection can spread further into your bladder and kidneys - trust me these infections can be very painful so if it gets worse see a doctor immediately.|`|vj93MNjBaa	You might have a urinary tract infection.  You must always always ALWAYS pee RIGHT AFTER having sex EVERY TIME.  Peeing afterwards helps get any bacteria out of your urethra or urethral area that might cause an infection.<br>  <br>  The bacteria is (sorry this is gross) from your or your partner's bum area.

DI3u9gMSaa	You don't need to take the aligners out.  All aligners get duller in their appearance - this is natural.  A little alcohol isn't going to make a significant difference.  It's much better if you drink through a straw and not let the alcohol touch the aligners, of course.  I've poured soda inside my mouth (head tilted up) with the aligners still on.  Just make sure to clean the aligners when you get home with some toothpaste (avoid whitening).  It's a huge pain to take them out when you're with company, but if you want them really, really unnecessarily perfectly clean, you'll have to go through a lot of trouble.<br>  <br>  Though it's advised to clean your aligners after every meal, I only washed my aligners at night and after two weeks they were in still pretty good shape.

Yes walking out in the sunshine, withou|`|AA12358000	Amy T,<br>  <br>  <br>  In infants, eczema typically occurs on the forehead, cheeks, forearms, legs, scalp and neck. In older children eczema occurs on the face, neck and the insides of the elbows, knees and ankles. Most infants with eczema show significant improvement by the age of two and about 40% outgrow eczema entirely by the time they are young adults. Controlling eczema early can help keep it from becoming worse. Eczema in babies is sometimes triggered by lupus and usually responds well to home remedies. Neotnatal lupus is sometimes passed from mother to the infant during pregnancy and the birth process. Lupus antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the fetus and result in lupus illness in the newborn. Infant lupus usually causes a rash but fortunately it usually clears up after six to eight months if there are no complications. Lupus is actually an attack of the body upon itself. Lupus can take two forms, sometimes causing eczema and sometime attacking vital organs of the body. An infant with eczema should only wear soft all cotton clothing with no synthetic fibers. Parents with infants who have eczema should wash the child’s bedding and clothing only in hypoallergenic detergents and the clothing should be sent through the rinse cycle twice. Also, you should keep the child’s room and play areas free of dust mites because they are a common eczema trigger. Some parents don’t realize that baby eczema is often triggered by food allergies. One recent study revealed that about 40 percent of babies with eczema suffered from food allergies. Diary is often the culprit. Babies who are breast feeding may also get food allergies from substances in the mother’s milk. It is important for breastfeeding moms to especially careful about their diet. You should be very careful about using baby lotions on infants with eczema. Some of the lotions have a high water content that that can dry and irriate3 the skin when evaporation takes place. Some of the fragrances and active ingredients in baby lotion can aggravate eczema symptoms. Creams and ointments containing all natural ingredients should be used instead of baby lotions. Many health food stores have these types of products. Most parents find that natural home remedies are the best way to treat their infant’s eczema symptoms. <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Look at instructions in the pack and make sure you know where to insert (check out Scarleteen <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarleteen.com</a> if unsure) Use organic tampons like Cottons which are softer so more comfortable to insert, also non-applicator tampons are simpler, plus it's one less thing to bin. <br>  <br>  To insert first wash hands, also do this after. Wait until a heavy day and use the lowest absorbency, get into a comfortable position, unwrap the tampon and pull the string so it hangs freely. Hold the tampon in one hand and with the other hand hold your labia open out of the way of your vaginal opening, then insert the tampon as far as it will go, aim towards the small of your back. Don't be scared to put your fingers into your vagina, it's yours, it's clean and menstrual blood is clean, if you're tense your vagina will tense so relax. If you have problems try masturbating as when aroused your vagina doubles in size, becomes relaxed and lubricated, or use lubrication such as KY jelly or olive oil to make insertion easier. If you feel pain as you move after insertion it's not in far enough so remove and try again with a fresh tampon later. <br>  <br>  If you have problems inserting don't panic just try another time or use another option such as pads, sponges, softcups, free-flow, or menstrual cups which are internal like tampons but far safer, cleaner, easier to use, and can be worn for 12 hours any time of your period without leaking. <br>  <br>  To remove get comfortable, relax and pull strings gently but firmly, if you can't find the strings or are using cloth, sponge or soft tampons just grab the tampon itself to remove. A tampon can never get lost inside you, but if you can't remove them you need to ask someone for help or go to hospital. Tampons aren't flushable so wrap up and bin. You need to change every 4-6 hours, always use the lowest absorbency making sure to change as your flow changes, never use when your flow is light, before your period or when you go to bed. You should alternate between tampons and pads, pads are also needed as back-up, try Lunapads which are far more comfortable than pads you may be used to. Tampons have many health risks as they encourage bacteria, damage vaginal walls and some brands contain harmful chemicals, as a result tampons have many health risks associated with them such as vaginal infections or the rare but life-threatening illness Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). This is why there are precautions to follow when using tampons, note the younger you are the higher the risk. Symptoms of TSS are headache, vomiting, rash, high fever and diarrhea, if you suspect you have TSS remove the tampon immediately and go straight to hospital.

And they have a nasty side effect:  they empty your wallet.  Save up for a good surgeon (cheap = bad).  If you still want larger breasts by then, then go for it.  At least then you'll know you'll get results.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
4BPYNiKVaa	there is nothing scary most likely it is du to the dry throat and the presence of mild wounds following the forced cough, but it can be a simple sinusitis that was worsened by corticoides you are taking, try to take warm liquids to moisten your throat for the following hours and avoid getting dehydrated while waiting to see your doctor|`|eFs3BUVkaa	Is it tinged with blood or are you actually coughing up blood? I am just finally getting over something with pretty similar syptoms and was prescribed the same meds. When you forcefully cough or cough for an extended time you can burst a tiny blood vessel in your throat (the same thing can happen in your nose from excessive/forceful blowing), Try buying some over the counter Mucinex. For me this worked way better than the prescribed meds.|`|AA10477412	You have pneumonia<br>  <br>  GO to the ER immediately!!|`|oSHCPmiqaa	Go to the ER now. it sounds really serious. you may want to get a second opinion on your dry coughs. coughing up blood may indicate tuberculosis.
AjPbtm7oaa	That's disgusting.|`|AA11866559	Every woman has a story like this...don't feel bad|`|GCm6wlSZaa	I've have more than one embarassing period story. One of them is when I had a box of tampons in my locker, and these boys that were standing nearby just looked inside of my locker because they were looking for candy that I had but instead saw my box of tampons. Two of them was went hysterical with laughter, while the other claimed that he saw the candy to avoid embarassing me and himself. <br>  Another one was in grade 8 when my male teacher left our classroom to photocopy something and I thought that I had my period. So, I decided to sneak out quickly to avoid embarassing myself. While I was walking in the hallway with a tampon in my hand, we bumped into each other. He was like "Lourdes, where are you going?" and I was like "bathroom" and then he just glanced at my hand and was like "Oh" and he was smiling and giggled before walking off and I realized that I was still holding onto the tampon. I nearly died when I returned to class. I was surprised he didn't tell anyone... :)|`|iIIXw6f5aa	I was on my period in math and It went to my chair Literally there was a puddle of blood on my chair but a little puddle. Then all the guys saw it so i had to wipe the blood up with the back of my skirt. So there was tones of blood on the back of my skirt. I went to the nurse and had to change pants. It was sooo embarrassing!|`|oRZlNZk9aa	I started mine at church and got stains on the back of my dress and didnt have a pad so I had to ask my guy friends mom to give me one of hers because my mom wasnt there. And it was this huge pad and I swear everybody could see the bulge or hear it.|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	The very first time I got my periods, I had no clue what to do. I took a pad and went to school. Luckily, it was a half day but we had P.T. period ( Physical Training) and had a lot of running to do.I must add that our P.T. uniform was fully white, very much like a hospital nurse's uniform. Imagine my embarrassment when a girl from a higher class pointed out that I had stained my sparkling white bottom. Plus I had no soap and no  extra pad (my mom assumed that since it was my first period, I wouldn't get heavy flow). I somehow managed to wash my stain but it left behind a crude mark. I rushed home. <br>          Luckily, I attended an all girls school!|`|yKUq4zNXaa	I was in my first period, and I totally knew I got on my period, so I asked my teacher if I could go to the bathroom to make sure, and sure enough, I was. So I walked back into my first hour and whispered in my teachers ear if I could go to the nurse to get a tampon, so she let me go. And of course when I come back, all the guys in my class are laughing at my because they can see the lining of my extra tampon in my back pocket. It was so embarrassing. But I still laugh about it.|`|uaHzhUeoaa	My FIRST period was when I was at a sleepover. It was summertime, and she had a pool. We woke up in the morning, and I saw I had gotten it. I wasn't prepared, so I just used some wads of toilet paper. She said "Hey, Rosie, wanna go swimming?" I was like "Errrm, no thanks." She practically begged me to go swimming, and I finally shouted "NO! OK?! I don't want to freaking go swimming!!!! I just don't!" Her mom and dad and little sister all stared at me, cuz they knew why I said that. >.<|`|UANpgVupaa	Hey no need to feel bad. It happens to all of us. Mine started when I was in a basketball game - I went up for a lay-up and uh well we all know what happened.

Zt6eh6VRaa	It takes waaaay more than a cleanser to get acne under control. It takes using right products in the right way; and also, keeping up with the skin's ability to adapt to products that is the key.<br>  <br>  For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.  Then once your skin acclimates to this, then get a stronger benzoyl peroxide formuation – but make sure it doesn’t have pore-clogging ingredients in it. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. It usually takes a combination of a strong exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide to get clear. The other thing is to stay ahead of your skin's ability to adapt to products. If you use the same products in the same way your skin won't get clear either. You need to strengthen your homecare every couple of weeks - like using a stronger benzoyl peroxide or using the benzoyl twice a day.   If you want more help with this, we have a great long-distance client program that can help you get clear.  <a href="http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/longdistanceclients.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/lon...</a><br>  <br>  Because you are breaking out on your forehead, check out the ingredients in your hair products to make sure there are no pore cloggers in them.

But i have something in common i also have acne only on my forehead and i tried clean and clear and it didn't quite work i bought the acne pack. later i found out that it didn't work cuz it had salycilic acid one of the main ingredients in clean and clear causing my acne to look dark brown or burned and it also made more acne pop out in only one week of using it. then my parents bought me acne free the acne kit and in one day of using it my face looked much better only because the main ingredient was benzoyl peroxide which i researched and it is known as one of the most successful and frequently used ingredients to treat acne because what it does is open up the pores allowing more oxygen in killing the bacteria that causes acne which apparently can't live in a oxygen rich environment proactive also has this which is why it also works but acne free is better because it has more of the ingredient, but be careful because buying products with too much of it can hurt your skin start out with like 2.5% if that doesn't work then you can look for higher percentages.Salicylic acid which i researched also is only meant for non visible acne like bumps we have on our face but not exactly acne. This kit you should use twice a day once in the morning and at night the bottles are labed with steps so you know how to use it. but if you are only looking to buying either neutrogena or clean and clear i would say neutrogena because i have also tried it and it is better.|`|sgQFmip5aa	I have struggles with acne for years. I have tried so many products and i have been to the dermatologist many times.. will i have tried both perscription and over the counter the one that i have found that works best with my skin is the neutrogena skin care 3 step routine, you can find it in your local drug store or walmart. Its only 20 bucks and it has left my skin clear and soft. I still have a few breakouts every so often and i still have scaring from previous acne but it really has worked well in keeping my skin clear. I also scrub a couple times a week with the clinique face scrub. Its a little expensive but it is well worth your money. I have been using the same tube since december.

So, no french fries!!! And make it a point to change your pillow cover on a regular basis. And keep your towel clean. Use some disinfectant like Savlon while washing it. Use a good facewash suitable for your skin type and preferably a good astringent. Eat a lot of green veggies. The importance of eating fresh fruits and vegetables can never be overstated. Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. Cut down your intake of coffee and dairy products. Eat food that is rich in fiber, so that your bowel movements are regular. Eating a few bananas should help. Sleep on time. And you may rub honey on your face as well as it's a natural antibacterial.  Have patience. You should see improvement in a few days. Wish you luck. <br>  <br>  And I find Clean and Clear better. But you should use what suits you best.|`|9aC8u1j1aa	Here is a great article on a ten-year acne sufferer.

AAgX0SDcaa	Back a long time ago there were a few people that had sickle cell anemia, the sickling cells clog up the bloodstream enough to catch the malaria protozoa and help to stop the disease. These people with sickle cell lived long enough to reproduce and pass down their genes while many of the younger people without sickle cell died before they could reproduce. So the sickle cell trait was a survivor trait against malaria. That is why the regions with malaria are higher in sickle-cell populations, Africa and the Mediterranean areas mainly, and later people with the gene traveled to other areas.|`|XwVDlhsSaa	If someone has sickle cell disease or trait, they are immune to malaria. This is because malaria works by invading red blood cells to so it can grow and multiply. If a person has sickle cell, they can't get into the cell. If a person has the trait, the cell will sickle when it's invaded and is removed/destroyed by they spleen.<br>  <br>  Sickle cell disease is a type of hemoglobinopathy, which means there is something wrong with a person's hemoglobin, either quilitatively or quantitatively. There are many hemoglobinopathies. <br>  <br>  Hemoglobin (Hgb) C is another type of hemoglobinopathy. It's very similar to sickle cell and found mainly in West Africa or people of that descent. Like sickle cell, you need to be homozygous for the gene. If you just have one gene, you have the trait but not the disease. Hgb C has similar symptoms as sickle cell but without the pain. Also the cells form rectangular crystal shapes instead of sickling.

If you will read your instructions it says either the first Sunday after you start your period or the first day of your period.

If you wish - just look and see if the problem is worms - if you are shy just try a deworming course from the drug store.  <br>  If it is piles then you have 2 options - but first find the cause. treatments are suppository - the best, or cauterisation - not nice.<br>  If all else fails visit the doctor with your Mum!<br>  The chances of cancer are very small and normally the blood will appear like tar streaks in your stools.  <br>  If in doubt visit the quack!|`|wETQbPxGaa	GO TO A DOCTOR- you might simply have  hemorroids or it can be a symptom of colon cancer. if detected early it is almost 100% curable.|`|1cDo3REBaa	this might sound weird but it could just be because you're wiping too hard or too much, it usually sorts itself out just be more gentle :)

That costs around $1500.00.|`|bdN3sTBxaa	Alas, you need to go to a dentist.  If you are not allergic to them, taking a mild pain reliever (tylenol or something like it) will help for the short term.  Also, on the isle where toothpaste is found you will find products such as "Orajel."  It also will help for the short term.  Also, rinse your mouth with WARM water and then use warm, moist heat, such as a warm moist heating pad or a towel wrung out in very warm water on the cheek over the tooth.  The warm moist heat will help ease the pain, but the only thing that will make it stop is to go to the dentist and get it taken care of properly.|`|cukXH3lhaa	two key words my friend. "Oral Gel" .<br>  until you have the time or money to afford a trip to the dentist , for what will most likely be a root canal, this little drug will work wonders. you can find it at any walgreens or drug store. you can also try peppermint extract. <br>  all you simply do is apply the these directly to the tooth, or teeth, that hurt. it numbs it completely.|`|nawxFLoqaa	see a dentist it is infected

I didn't have much enamel loss but I wanted to prevent it from happening. My dentist always said it's not how many times you brush but how well you do it. So just make sure to brush, floss, rinse!|`|e5VUwaRsaa	I have this too. My dentist said there was nothing I could do to restore the enamel, but Sensodyne toothpaste would help with the sensitivity.

6NA2MXNPaa	You probably lose your appetite and eat less. If you have diarrhea or vomiting that would cause some weight loss too. You may get dehydrated too which would leave you with a "deflated" look with your cheeks and face sunken in. If you're sick you need to drink plenty of fluids, get plenty of rest, and don't worry about eating unless you really feel like you can tolerate it. Generally, once you get better, you regain your appetite and you gain the little bit of weight back that you lost from being sick. Hope that helps! Take care!|`|DsszxGT6aa	because you are emptying your stomach and everything you have eaten that day.
u5GQjpdAaa	Genital warts is a form of HPV. It is not herpes, I don't know why people keep getting this confused.<br>  <br>  They will be with you for the rest of your life. My doctor told me, as long as I have a healthy immune system, they should not occur. I get them from time to time, and it's just something that some have to deal with. If you keep at them, you might go a year without seeing any more of them, or even two years, but the virus is still there and can still cause them. <br>  <br>  Just keep healthy, and the warts will not come as often. This is the only way to try and "suppress"  them.<br>  <br>  You can also use a drug called "Condylox" (I think thats how its spelled). It is a topical cream, that will eat away at them. The over the counter stuff is cheaper, and seems to work better.<br>  <br>  You can take vinegar and put it on, this will give you a future picture of where the warts will come. <br>  <br>  Just watch yourself, and do not let them get to big, because they will hurt. HPV will not cause any long term health effects, but it can cause cervical cancer in women, just remember you are now a carrier of it.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Technically, we think that HPV, the virus that causes the warts, never really goes away.<br>  <br>  Once you've had the warts, it's always possible that they could recur, especially in times of stress or lowered immunity.<br>  <br>  Most of the time if they don't recur within 3 years, they won't ever come back. (Usually.) However they think that the virus is still present in your skin for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: HPV and herpes are not the same thing. They are both viruses, but they are different viruses causing different diseases.|`|yrzpCh2Xaa	dude warticon sucks, my advice go back to the clinic and make them freeze them. Im using warticon and mine over the past 2 month have only grown bigger and spread a bit. Im actually going in the morning to get this sorted out.|`|S97z99oHaa	I agree with Scorpio. I have hpv genitals warts.I get treated. There is no test to tell if someone has hpv genitals warts..Only a doctor can tell u if u have an outbreak and the warts are present. Therefore if you do not have the warts no more... and u don't get anymore outbreaks..How can someone say u still have the hpv virus??They don't know.. Becuz There is no test to prove that.I know an older lady who had genital warts and no longer has it.She had to get them burned off..and never had an outbreak since..It's been years.She has had unprotected sex and even had more children..and never passed it on.So when these people say the virus will always stay..They are wrong.They don't know.. It might stay..and it might not.Only your body's immune system can cure itself. That's why the doctor's say to eat healthy and not smoke when u have Hpv..cuz ur suppose to build up your immune system. If you look it up..You will find out I'm correct. Some case's of genital warts go away on their own..It depends on how bad it is and how healthy you are. I have Hpv..and had it since December..I know this for a fact.I've talked to doctors and did so much research on it.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	If your not sure if you have them you really should go to the doctor and get checked out. <br>  <br>  It depends it on the case. The virus will never go away though. Even if the warts are gone|`|H4wa95QTaa	Note sure never had them my advise would be to go the gum clinic where they can tell you everything.  Or even give you something to get rid of them.|`|0011Smdtaa	Genital warts are caused by the wart virus.  I think you can get attacks for the rest of your life but they will decrease as time goes by.  Some people only ever get 1 outbreak of genital warts others may get several for a few years, before they start getting less often.  Use a condom when you have the warts present as they are highly contagious and HPV [ human papillon virus] can cause cervical cancer in woman.   Hope this helps, and all the best.|`|s54CXsQxaa	If you have HPV, there is no cure but if you are healthy (don''t smoke, do not use drugs, don't drink alot) excercise and eat right, it can go away in about 2 years or less if you are young.

It is very rare that it develops in someone who has no family history of the disease. <br>  <br>  There are other mental illnesses, though, that are spread by family genetics but aren't triggered until something in the environment basically turns the switch on. Such as depression, which is a disorder most people are born to develop but it didn't set in until something in the environment causes it too, i.e loss of a job, income, death of a family member. Others got lucky with their switch never being flipped.<br>  <br>  I'm going off a rough guess here, it's been a few years since my psychology class and I'm trying my hardest to remember what I was taught. The causes section under wikipedia also explains it the same, I was always told not to rely on wikipedia but I can't find any other site that explains it so clearly.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_diso...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|Th2qZedsaa	i think depression is genetic as i know two people of the same family who have it. but i dont really think anything like that is fully genetic. if you have a family of  sufferers of something like that then it doesnt mean everybody will get it. i think everybody is prone to it but it just depends  on the other aspects of a personality and how people deal with things.<br>  <br>  :S maybe?? :S
AA10169678	You can't clear your throat because there is nothing there to clear. What you have are swollen vocal cords which give the sensation that there is something that needs to be cleared. It is diagnostic to have the sensation, vocal "cracking" (called "intermittent aphonia") and the inability to reach high notes.<br>  Lemon, sprays, will have no effect. In fact, hot water will make it worse because it does nothing to reduce the inflammation.<br>  Most often, poor technique is the culprit  Over use can be part of it, too.<br>  The only thing that will get your vocal cords back to normal is a couple of weeks of voice rest. in which you use those cords as little as is humanly possible. That means NONE of the following:<br>  Humming<br>  Singing<br>  Throat-clearing (drink cool (not cold) or tepid water, instead).<br>  Coughing<br>  Loud whispering<br>  Talking<br>  Laughing<br>  Yelling<br>  all of those behaviors cause the vocal cords to bang together, so it's really important to be mindful of them.<br>  When you begin to sing again, use chest register rather than head register. It will cause your vocal cords far less trauma and take better care of them.|`|a49Musptaa	i use lemon juice, and i'm a singer. and that doesn't always work so try pomegranate juice it helps!

RXI8ImdIaa	You haven't told us how high your fever is!<br>  <br>  If it's tolerable - let's say up to about 101 or 102 F, leave it alone. Stay hydrated, and resist the temptation to do things to cool off - like cold showers, taking off your clothes, that sort of thing. The mild fever is actually a good response because it helps you kill whatever is invading your body.<br>  <br>  Now if it's getting too high, you should try taking some Tylenol to lower the fever. If it doesn't respond to Tylenol, and you are 103 or higher, call your doctor for more specific advice.|`|AA10450066	Drink plenty of cool water, and resist the idea to cover up.If your chilled use some sheets,but no heavy blankets.A fever, if over 101 need to breathe.A fever is telling you that your body is fighting an infection somewhere in your body.If you can't control it with tylenol, or it goes too high then seek medical help very soon.|`|IRNqpOmSaa	Take a cloth, dip in isopropyl rubbing alcohol, dampen it, and place it on your forehead, the back of your neck, your back, under your armpits (any 'exterior' part of your body where heat is released in excess).

KOYC3XkJaa	Redness after 2 days is nothing to worry about. Even 1st degree burns take about a week to heal. I'm assuming it's 1st degree since you didn't mention any blistering. Please correct me if I'm wrong, because the rest of my answer is going off of that assumption.<br>  Since there's no broken skin, the likelihood of infection is minuscule. No broken skin means there's no opening for bacteria to get in. Because of that, using neosporin or another antibacterial cream isn't necessary. If the burn is painful, then you may want to use some sort of cream for pain relief, but there are creams and gels made to be used on burns and those will help you out the most. You can head to your local pharmacy and browse around. Aloe gel would also be a perfectly fine option.<br>  If you're worried about banging into things (since it's on your hand) you may want to lightly bandage it with nonstick gauze to keep it covered and protected.|`|AA12320162	I have heard that vanilla works on burns.<br>  The vanilla that is you Mom's baking cupboard.|`|K70AncTNaa	ok. put Neosporian on it.

AA10169678	If you had airway obstruction, you'd feel like you were going to cough up a lung, so that is clearly not the problem.<br>  Acid reflux will cause tightening of the muscles at the top of the esophagus in order to protect the lungs. This makes the swallowing of solids like meat or bread difficult. It will also affect the ability to swallow small bits of fluid, such as the saliva (yes, you read that right) that you are "puking up". Patients find it much easier to swallow a large bolus of liquid, such as a normal sized amount you'll have when taking fluids.<br>  You may want to treat the reflux with an over-the-counter anti-acid, such as Zantac, Pepcid, or Prilosec. Tums or other calcium-based (Mylanta, Maalox) don't work for acid reflux.|`|1yJWrccXaa	If such a thing were to really happen to a person don't try to eat or drink anything else.

Place this just above the navel and repeatedly and forcefully ram the fists up and in until obstruction is dislodged.  You can also lean over the back of a chair and force your abdomen down onto it with force.

a769b15c22849f6a8b49b70abf9adf30aa	Hi, I have been suffering from the same problem for the last 10-12 years. I have constant pain in both of my calves and because of this I cannot sleep peacefully at night and am constantly tired. Just like you being tired makes me lazy and I feel like I am constantly sleep deprived. Just like you I run work out routinely. This really affects my performance and concentration at work. I have gone thru several orthopedic doctors and have various tests like nerve test (shock test), blood test, ultrasound of leg veins to check for flow of blood. Nothing has helped so far.<br>  <br>  Are you flat footed? I am very flat footed but I'm not sure if that contributes to the problem because I have custom made medical insoles which support my arch. I think you should definitely look into custom insoles because flat foot injuries can really take a toll on your legs long term or rest of your life.<br>  <br>  No need to be scared but you definitely need to go see a doctor. If possible go see an acupuncturist if your insurance supports it. This is not something to be taken lightly.<br>  <br>  One more thing. My leg pain is higher when I am mentally stressed out. Is that the same for you? I also read on a forum that this could also be a psychological problem especially if you're having nightmares or dealing with some mental stress.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Your blood sugar levels might be low, so your blood might be rushing to your head. Does this normally happen when you get up too quickly?

I have added a site with some info. <br>  <a href="http://www.devonshirelodge.co.uk/acute/chestpain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.devonshirelodge.co.uk/acute/c...</a>
KzRH5LjZaa	its OK i would put aloe Vera plant/spray to make it heal quicker. <br>  <br>  it probably wont go away altogether it will normally leave a scar but that's about it|`|cwsYM2F4aa	If it scabs up, it will leave a scar once the scab falls off.  Burn scars take a lot longer to lighten up than other scars do.  I burned my forearm on the top of an oven about five years ago and I still have a spot there that's slightly darker than the other skin from it.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	I've burned my arms many times and it generally, after a long time, looks white.And it doesn't tan well either.
M3pRAe7Vaa	Yes, if you are having trouble breathing to the point where you are unable to catch your breath, and even vomiting, you need to see your doctor again.  Additionally, since you have a fever and feel worse, you may have developed an infection since you last saw him/her.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Call the doctor first. They may be able to help you over the phone, or they may want you to return to the office.|`|THuplVHpaa	You sound like you may have bronchidis (sp?) <br>  You should go to a doctor, pronto!!
VtqdeSQ8aa	This depends on you. I have to take my diet pills  w/something or they turn my stomach and make me throw up.
H93JbQS0aa	Boil, if your digestive system is not doing so good, it will come on ur tongue, lol|`|B1jZars7aa	Its just a little ulcer,where a pore is blocked.Does not mean, you,ve been telling porkies honey.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	you probably bit your tongue or burned it and didn't remember|`|t4DP30r6aa	Swollen taste bud.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	taste buds and herpes|`|oojO4WAraa	Well then - your mum should have a lot of them.  You do not get spots on your tongue from lying.  <br>  <br>  You would have to give more details about the spot for anyone to have an idea what it is.
URLBtqHdaa	For some people i'm sure it helps, and for others it may make things work. I don't think there is a general answer that suits everyone because everyone reacts to sitautions differently.
IAVOLvCEaa	sometimes lemons can reduce the freckles on your face but bleaching your skin? I'm not sure|`|OQ5HAfyIaa	it can bleach hair, so it can probably bleach skin..
7ab916140739d43fdaf1975e036f6b98aa	Unless you are on Rifampin, there is no major interaction between contraceptives and antibiotics.  It is more of a theoretical interaction, which is not really seen in the real world.  When you compare failure rates of people on contraceptives on antibiotics to those who are not, there is an insignificant difference between the two.  If you are worried, use a second form of birth control for a week after you stop taking the antibiotic.|`|AA10355087	I have used the Nuva Ring for almost a year now and last month I was sick and needed antibiotics. Nothing happened, everything was fine.|`|AA11306457	Depends on the antibiotic.  Some antibiotics can interfere with the hormones in the nuva ring, and make it less effective.  If your doctor isn't responding to you, you can also talk to a pharmacist about it as they also know about drug interactions.  Hope this helps and good luck.
qsWk3Fo6aa	That's just a contusion from where you landed.  No big deal.  When you get bruised your body will form a collegen web around the bruise that may get hard depending on the severity of the injury.  It's nothing|`|f72ffc14c44eb1b83565f6f615f23f28aa	its a cist go to docters and tell him you need an exray
EiQtzZHPaa	no! not nearly as much as tonsillitis does! in-fact it is usually a painless surgery with a very quick recovery time you should be fine as long as you don't get a tummy ache from all the ice cream you will be eating!|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Most competent surgeons remove both at the same time.<br>  <br>   I think you will be bothered quite a bit this time.|`|aaqKW3pRaa	They are the same... I have had both out before the age of 10 and didn't feel a thing except for the shots so that shows how little that hurts.|`|Rc7Gyqj9aa	i would say your adenoids would hurt more, so you probably have nothing to worry about
fme5kHAsaa	shouldn't hurt.  Depending on your technician, it takes just a few minutes to take them off but cleaning off the cement is what takes the time.  We allow 1 1/2 hours because we also have the doctor place your retainers on that day as well.<br>  <br>  Congratulations.  You have done the work and now you have the reward.  A beautiful smile that will last a lifetime.  Just a note, wear those retainers.  Very Very important.  Your teeth will always want to move back to their original position....forever.  Wear them full time until your orthodontist tells you to go to nighttime only.   In a few years you should put them in on Sunday night and if you feel no discomfort on Monday morning you are good to go.  If you do feel or see movement, wear the retainers full time again for about two weeks and you'll be back in shape again.  Do this FOREVER if you want to keep you teeth straight FOREVER!!!|`|d442bb19c50d42a1e21f5b79e0056189aa	I just got mine off 2 weeks ago. Piece of cake! It only took about 10 min. to pull the brackets all off. I had ceramic on top and they were a little more difficult. It's alot of tugging and cracking (with ceramic) but the metals you didn't even know they were out! Then they'll polish your teeth and this really isn't much of a bother it's just loud and smells like somethings burning. Then they may take more xrays and photos. And depending on if you alreay got a mold for your retainer you'll get that too.|`|oYGtkVwOaa	Yea definatly less painfull then putting them on. It doesn't take that long like less then a hour. It's really fun not haveing braces on. <br>  Good Luck !!|`|6QC4NRu2aa	It takes 1/2 hour and trust me, it hurts less than putting them on! :)|`|dwok9z8faa	takes about 10 min. it doesn't hurt- it is a little uncomfortable though<br>  u also get a slimy feel to ur teeth for about the day- i had to brush my teeth like 4 times to get the weird slimy feely taste out. <br>  BUT its all worth it.
Jn3BtFOYaa	You can but you shouldn't.<br>  <br>  The gum may stick onto the acrylic or plastic (depending on whether you have a Hawley or the Essix type), and make it messy.  <br>  <br>  I was always able to get the gum off my Hawley retainer, but it wasn't fun and I think it made it look tatty after a while.|`|Q7st7Uasaa	You got to take it off.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	u arent supposed to|`|fme5kHAsaa	it's difficult but possible.  There are gums out there that are less gooey.  Like StickFree.  But, you can take the retainer out for a hour and chew the gum then put it back in  and it won't hurt your alignment.
60FewKX6aa	No. Usually you have to wear it both day & night for 6 months and then just at night for 6 months. After that you're usually done. <br>  <br>  <br>  Your orthodontist should tell you specifically how he/she wants you to wear it.|`|zGosAc0Maa	This will depend on how extensive your teeth have corrected since you first had them put on, till now at the finish line.  I can tell you do NOT make any changes TOO soon. I feel it will be too soon from you wearing braces, then going straight to wearing the retainer just at night. Now, it is vital once your braces are taken off your ortho glues a retainer to the back of the lower teeth that is probably just cover @ 4 to 5 teeth. This silver retainer stays in your mouth and no one can see it.  Keep this retainer in as long as you can, Ii recommend at least a year, if you do NOT follow the rules in regards to your retainer you will be VERY surprised with how fast your teeth will move around and back to the shape they were in before your braces were put on. I am now speaking from experience.|`|9kAv51Iwaa	ask your dentist
zGosAc0Maa	The more you wear your retainer especially for the first couple of months after you have them taken off - you will NOT have a lisp and you will get used to the retainer faster and easier.  You will do just fine. Take the your Otho's recommendations and what and how he tells you to wear the retainer, how to clean it, everything.  You would be so amazed how fast your teeth will move. I am speaking from experience.|`|wOecmtrzaa	no, not everyone gets a lisp.  The weirdest thing about it is the piece of plastic that is on the rouf of your mouth all the time.  Its odd at first, but then you will get used to it really quickly.<br>  <br>  Congrats on getting your braces off!|`|mxlbMbBqaa	it feels weird<br>  <br>  kind of like someone holding your teeth, only all the time|`|eHidj8pcaa	it feels weird at first and you'll probably have trouble talking. <br>  but you get used to it after a while. <br>  <br>  by the way, make sure you listen to your orthodontist and wear it when instructed. cause if your teeth move, you'll have that retainer extra long.<br>  and make sure you wash it too. :)  (just brush it with your tooth brush and tooth paste)|`|4D2ZRK6naa	not bad it wortst to have braces so if you got thru dat youll b fine
eUJvbvBNaa	Say your pretty and f*** everybody else|`|SmOefD5Raa	There are a number of self esteem hypnosis cd's<br>  Continually tell yourself how awesome you are.<br>  What you think... you become.|`|jyVqvRxHaa	get plastic surgery and be high and don't go into the light to much|`|db0NnEjGaa	LOVE YOURSELF!|`|ja7J2cE2aa	Why take crap from other people when they're all just a bunch of idiots?

BRDqfAy3aa	check below - Your NORMAL IDEAL WEIGHT (according to BMI)
iUzSlmSbaa	No, it's not true.. unless you have diabetes, then it's correct, a person who has diabetes has to have their meals at approximately the same time each day.. that's important for diabetics or their blood sugar level will get too low. Might be good for digestion to eat at regular times. Not too late in the evening, so as not to go to bed on a ''full stomach'' . Other than when someone suffers from diabetes it doesn't matter really.|`|uy6sBhipaa	This is some truth to it and you should make an effort to eat with the family as a means of bonding and sharing. It recognizes the work your mother does for you. You should serve everyone and just give yourself half portions. It would make everyone's life more peaceful and harmonious and requires little effort. For just a little effort and time you could make your life more pleasant. 8>}|`|8hIUOajLaa	I have never heard of such a thing.<br>  Personally I think she wants you to eat at regular times, but that's not a good way to get someone to do it. You cant force someone to be hungry.|`|EM7TxEHuaa	hey,mom's always  right|`|wLXV8GU9aa	I don't eat at regular times (I never really have), but I do eat the same amount as I would if I did. So, really as long as you're getting the right amount of nutrition it doesn't matter at what times you get it. She's probably just trying to get you to eat at regular times.|`|df803ac845624e37559acc061d7d047aaa	It is not true that you have to eat at regular times, as long as you eat when your hungery you'll be okay.<br>  <br>  Maybe mom wants your attention or she just wants you to join her for diner?|`|3lnICFrgaa	Not too sure, try this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.personalhealthzone.com/eatregular.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalhealthzone.com/eatreg...</a>|`|aHER8myJaa	yeah you want to keep your blood sugar levels in appropriate range steadily not swinging wildly so more smaller meals through the day is better|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Your Mother is so right|`|KYTTYhK0aa	Moms know best!!!!;)|`|I2Hh3kRQaa	that would be a big no|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	That's true. It's also true that when you eat at regular intervals it'll help you stay skinny. When you eat a bunch of food all at once and none for the rest of the day, your body holds onto whatever it can get because it's afraid of starving. When you just snack throughout the day, your body will get confused and you'll usually end up eating more than you really want.|`|HI0oQriqaa	mothers are never wrong.
GBG2hbQ4aa	Yes, all the symptoms you describe can be related to mono. The best reference I have come across on mono is out of the book "Prescription for Nutritional Healing" by Balch and Balch.  Most health food stores keep a store copy on hand for staff (and sometimes customers) to use as a reference.  You may be able to access a copy to read.  The section on mono is less than a page and a half long... has some good information in it.  <br>  <br>  According to this book, mono affects the respiratory system, the lymphatic tissues, and glands in the neck, groin, armpits, bronchial tubes, spleen, and liver.  Symptoms include depression, extreme fatigue, fever, generalized aching, headache, jaundice, loss of appetitie, sore throat, pain on upper left side of abdomen, puffy eyelids, swollen glands, and sometimes, a red bumpy rash.  The spleen can become enlarged, and liver function may be affected.<br>  <br>  More important than all this info about what it is and what it does, the section on how to strengthen the body to support recovery is invaluable.  If you can get your hands on a copy, that would be best.  Writing it all out can be long.  I am happy to do so if you cannot find a copy...just email me and let me know.<br>  <br>  I include here the nutrients that are listed as 'very important' to take for mono....<br>  *   acidophilus (get a very good source, one that is kept refrigerated in the health food store); take as directed on label.  Acidophilus are 'friendly' bacteria that are important for a healthy immune system. <br>  *   proteolytic enzymes; as directed on label 3-4 times daily, between meals and at bedtime (on an empty stomach).  Reduces inflammation and aids in the absorption of nutrients.<br>  *   vitamin A with mixed carotenoids; 25,000 IU daily for two weeks, then slowly reduce to 15,000 IU daily.  Essential for immune system; use emulsion forms for easier assimilation and greater safety at high doses.<br>  *   vitamin E;  800 IU daily for 4 weeks; slowly reduce to 400 IU daily.  Use d-alpha-tocopherol form.<br>  *  vitamin C with bioflavonoids; 5,000-10,000 mg daily, in divided doses.  Destroys the virus and boosts the immune system.  A buffered or esterified form is best (especially at this high dose).  Book doesn't indicate length of dosing at this level.  The body is quick to tell you when you take too much vitamin C.  I would suggest starting off at 2,000 mg daily (taken in two doses).  Increase to 3,000mg after a week, then to 4,000mg, then to 5,000mg.  At the  point that you experience diarrhea, reduce the dose by 1,000mg.  As your body's need for vitamin C lessens, you will continue to reduce the doseage until you are at a maintainance dose of 1,000mg daily.<br>  <br>  There's much more in the book, like I said.  If you want additional information, let me know.|`|X4qRsuFoaa	Sorry, I really don't anything on this subject but I wish you the best of luck.<br>  You are now in my prayers. Hope you find your cure =] God Bless.
0b6b9f60bb6870d870e9293391c0c742aa	Start with your general practitioner. After getting a full physical exam and routine blood work and nothing comes up as out of the ordinary, then either go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist. If something doesn't seem right, then maybe a neurologist is your best bet. It could something as simple as getting older, as one poster said.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	It's called, "getting older."<br>  <br>  Here's the difference. If you forget what you were about to say, it's normal aging. If you forget how to speak ... or who the person is that you're speaking to ... it's likely more serious.|`|WkLJI40baa	See your GP and get a full blood test performed.

8QhPUxllaa	See your doctor!  This totally doesn't sound right at all!  I have never heard of this and really think you should get it checked out.  It is probably something silly and nothing to worry about but it always good to just get it checked out.  That is what GP's are there for!  <br>  They will probably do a blood test and some checks and then give you some tablets and it will all go away :]|`|mSt1LGfjaa	sounds like cluster headaches honey, my husband has them so bad he cries,they dont last ling and he gets them like at night time,they seem to come certain times,but you still need to have it checked out to be sure,,hope you feel better.|`|sAEYkNSqaa	I have something similar like this except my vision goes sort of gray and i feel like if i am going to collapse, i feel no pain just dizziness it should be nothing to worry about
yotafojtaa	yeah I think most girls are. The build up of hormones before your period just increase libido!<br>  In response to the post above mine, it's not because we can't get pregnant then. girls are usually most horny mid-cycle because that's when the egg is released and we're most fertile (just a nature thing) but being horny just before your period is only a side effect of all the hormones going wild in our bodies! Another side effect is being moody and snappy, as I'm sure you've discovered.<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|QB1u1I3kaa	yes its quite common to feel really horny during and right after your period, you can do something about it, have an orgasm!|`|yLafxy2raa	ladies please contact me right before you get your periods.. i will be happy to take care of your problems|`|zz3mj3kLaa	OH MY GOSH!

Its many times a day for us.   As a female you will go through a cycle of about even with the moon.<br>  <br>  Our cycle is measures in hours.  Your is measured in days.<br>  <br>  8-)  Hope it was your best answer.    By the way.  Masturbation is not just important for us males.  Its vital for females to do also.<br>  The more you do this the better you get at it.  Later it pays off big time when you have real sex.

The reason is not the exhaled smoke but the smoke that rises from a lit cigarette and escapes into the room. The smoker inhales smoke through a filter, the waitress (or other personnell) inhales it from the tip of the cigarette, i.e. without it being filtered. So it is actually a lot more potent and dangerous.

zxmfNzEWaa	that happend to me as well im 17 to i went ot the doctor and they checked my overy, so happens that i had like 5 cysts and those cysts are what couse all those changes in your body. <br>  <br>  cysts arent all bad there is different kinds and might come out on there own but sometimes they dont and thats what couses the pain and suffering, becaus eyou really do suffer. i feel and understand your pain. <br>  but yea when i went they checked and they told me to go on the pill, i didnt want to but my mom told my doctor to give it to me, since she also understands, my doctor said that all those problems women have are a percent hereditary, so my mom knew. <br>  <br>  my doctor also told me the pill is goign to help, it regulates your menstrual cycle and makes the cramps less painful. and mine are really painful it causes me migraines. so its up to you and your parents to see what you want to do but i really recommend you to to the doctor so you know for sure whats happening. <br>  <br>  hope i helped a little :)|`|t2LOcPkLaa	Since it's been going on for awhile I'm reluctant to say that it's just normal irregularity because of your age. There could be a more serious problem so you should go see and ob-gyn soon! The doctor will want to do some tests to make sure nothing is wrong. They are likely to prescribe the pill because it helps to regulate your cycle. You don't have to go to planned parenthood, go see a regular ob-gyn. Talk to your mom about it & ask her to take you to see her doctor. If the doctor prescribes the pill he/she can explain to your mom that he/she is not prescribing the pill  for birth control, but it is to help you.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	You need to see a doctor.

60FewKX6aa	I have a retainer and I'm supposed to wear it day & night for 6 months. I haven't been wearing at all during the day, usually just at night and sometimes I don't even do that.<br>  <br>  My teeth aren't crooked from not wearing it but I notice that after a few days of not wearing it it's hard to get the retainer on. <br>  <br>  So, all in all, I would recommend you wear as often as possible. Even if it's annoying. If you take it out for awhile put it somewhere where you'll see it and remember to put it back in.|`|dwok9z8faa	i would recommend when u get ur retainer where it every night for a while and then wear it every night or every other night<br>  it is easiest, u don't run the risk of ur teeth moving back- u don't want braces again! <br>  if u have to miss a night, no big deal... but don't just not wear it<br>  after a few nights to a week of not wearing it at night, u can kinda feel ur retainer is a little tighter and then it goes away after a couple min.<br>  but i would just wear it whenever and not wait over a week to two weeks<br>  good luck :)

iZqSEQQsaa	From what I understand they'll usually ask you about your diet and physical activity. They may run a few tests on you. But they're not so bad, it's all worth it in the long run. They'll probably have you put on the gown, lay back and put your feet in the "stirrups"for a pap smear. They will explain anything and everything about the tools they use during this procedure, the stuff they're testing for, and they'll answer any questions you have. In your case they will most likely draw a little blood. Then you just wait for the call back. They'll set up an appointment and that's when you'll get any results. Most of the time these tests are done to just rule certain things out. Once everything is ruled out they'll probably try a few things. They might try to tell you certain foods to watch out for. Usually they end up putting women with irregular mentrual cycles on a birth control pill which actually helps regulate the cycles. This usually works. I'm not a doctor, but my sister and aunt bothe went through somethings very similar. The doctors will stick with you till they find something that works. Good luck and don't be scared of getting the tests done... Be scared of not getting the tests done and not knowing if it could be serious.|`|UIS8Wll1aa	Hun they  will ask you a few ?s and then do blood test then blood pressure weight all that then you will get undressed they will check breast then do pap-smear don't hurt just uncomfortable|`|ZBMHCC4taa	i have irregular periods form time to time.nothing shoud be wrong with you,but go just to get the worry to go away.|`|QmhNNibxaa	It can be a little scary to go to your first gynecological exam, but if you find a good doctor that makes you comfortable the  you should be fine. What will happen most likely is that you will be asked to undress privately and wear one of those paper dresses. You will be asked a ton of questions about lifestyle and sex life--- you should be HONEST-- About drug use, about sexual activity and anything they ask. It is especially important to tell the truth about smoking since they might put you on hormonal birth control to make your periods more regular and smoking increases side effects. A male doctor should always have a female nurse in the room during the exam. <br>  <br>  Gurl.com has a really in depth break down of what to expect. Check out the link below!|`|tkqV2CI5aa	My sister is the same way, she has thyriod problems. Mine has always been irregular, so they put my sister on birth control saying it was going to help her is all they did. They may give you a pap. which is just checking you out in your vaginal area. Nothing to worry about. At one point i had mine every week for 3 days a week, that went on for 3 months!|`|aHER8myJaa	yeah if you're over 16 and no or irregular periods you usually go and they put you on birth control to regulate or attempt to jump start it|`|AE6Rap6vaa	Thats silly? Alot of woman have irregular periods and things are just fine and normal.....Im willing to bet $$$$ that they are going to suggest you go on the pill to regulate! STUPID! It will regulate on its own.....|`|MWpv2so2aa	When you go in you will have to fill out papers, then when she calls you back, she will ask you all kinds of questions, like how many days between your period and do you have alot of pain. Stuff like that. Then she will most likely do a pap smear on you and maybe even a pelvic exam, but they don't hurt, its just embarassing!  A pap smear is where she will go into your vagina and take a sample off of your cervix and a pelvic exam , she will feel up in your vagina with her 2 fingers to feel your ovaries and uterus and she will ask if you feel any pain from that. Then, she will send you to have blood work done most likely. Then she will wait for those tests to come back before she makes a final decision on treatment. Just don't be nervous, its really not that bad. You will do fine and Good luck!

Sh7r0kNuaa	it does not feel anything like weed. if that's what your looking for, buy some weed. it makes you go on a hallucinogenic trip for about 5-10 minutes (which, from experience, can be quite intense and really fun) and then you are brought back to reality pretty quick with some tiny lingering effects which last about 15 minutes or a longer if you use a vaporizer (but that also makes the trip a lot more powerful). the after effects just feel a little trippy, not stoned. i dont know how to describe them, you just think differently. it also has an anti-depressant-like effect for about 2 days, you just feel naturally happy (no high).|`|gDHsx5I3aa	I've never smoked the extract. But i've tried smoking regular salvia leaves and it was a very mellow feeling. The extract is very potent and you should try it with a sober person around to baby sit you.

Make sure your surroundings are safe, it can be fun as long as you're careful.<br>  <br>  Go to a head shop (a place where they sell bongs and pipes and stuff) and ask the people working if they sell it.

LmaGaIosaa	Slimming world has an excellent eating plan where they have lots of free foods which you can eat as much of these as you want as long as you don't mix your carbohydrates with your proteins.  If you are eating on a green day which are days that you are allowed carbohydrates, you can eat as much rice potatoes pasta as you like.  Eggs you can eat as many as you can all of the time there is not limit on both green days and original days (protein days) All fruit and vegetables are free foods on both days too.  On original days you eat as much of any type of protein rich foods as you like eg meat fish poultry.  Just don't mix your original and green days together.  If you stick to this you really will loose a lot of weight.  Also Muller lite yogurts are classed as a free food and you can eat as many of these as you like in a day.<br>  <br>  Good luck hope you manage it, it is SO achievable.

QmhNNibxaa	Masturbation is a good one. Orgasms contract the uterus much like the natural contractions that cause cramps, but this way it feels much better! I don't think it will speed it up much more than a day or so. There are also some pretty extreme methods if there is a really important occasion you dont want to be on the rag for. Midwives and naturopathic gynos insert this tube through the cervix and remove most of the blood which ends the menses period pretty quickly. I cant remember what it's called though, and it's rare to find people that do it though it is an ancient practice.|`|557nSJb1aa	Going on birth control (the hormonal kind) can usually make your periods lighter/shorter or get rid of them completely.

ZUAFl3toaa	When I quit I did smoke a few cigarettes on it.. it didn't do anything. If you are using the strongest level of the patch (the most nicotine) it's probably much more risky and it may make you feel nauseous/have a headache, but if it's the lower strength ones it's not all that detrimental. In this though, I'm not saying it's a good idea though. For one, patches are expensive and if you're using them to quit.. quit. And second, it's still not safe. I mean, smoking is never safe, but specifically with the patch, no, it's not really safe to smoke... you won't die though.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to quit.. just some suggestions.. replace smoking with something.. I replaced it with drinking Dr. Pepper instead. Avoid situations where you will REALLY want to smoke, such as in the car or at a party or bar. If you usually smoke after you eat it could be because you're over eating and becoming so full that you need the nicotine to calm your stomach, so try not to get to that "I'm so full I want a cigarette point" Instead, eat foods that are healthily filling like sushi, whole grain cereal or bread, pasta, potatoes, etc. so you don't feel sickly after eating. Drink a lot of water and try something for the oral fixation such as chapstick, gum, or small pieces of candy.<br>  <br>  Just some suggestions that helped me!|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Smoking in general is known to adversely effect the heart and circulation. <br>  <br>  Estrogen in excess of the normal physiological levels has been implicated in an increase in blood clot in arteries. <br>  <br>  Smoking plus estrogen has been further implicated in causing blood clots that lead to heart attacks and strokes.|`|CNSGz12zaa	I did it for three months ..I smoked a lot less(from 2 packs a day to half a pack) but it also gave me the cold sweats and I was jittery.

kC8JHWVQaa	We all cough to remove something from our bodies that does not belong so when we get sick the body builds up more secretions  in the air ways, nose throat etc.etc and with more we have to cough to remove this waste and to get rid of since its no good for us  your body's way of trying say trapping the virus we have picked up now the body is trying to rid the body of such viruses or bacteria And the stuff that went in doesn't belong there..., We have receptors that cause us to cough from things that don't belong,,most common is the cold, allergies, asthma,smoke, fumes,dust/dirt, pet hairs, candles, purfumes,many many thing make a person cough.

This is going to sound pretty disgusting but extra mucus is produced during illness to catch any bacteria and stop more of whatever's made you ill from entering your body, and you cough it back up regularly to stop the mucus from entering your lungs and choking you.<br>  I know how you feel though, I woke myself up coughing pretty much every hour last night and it's killing my throat and head, but sadly something we just have to cope with. If your cough lasts over 2 weeks you should go to the doctor, but apart from that try cough medicine every few hours and just take it easy, try not to get too stressed about it

AA11048920	The textbook answer to this question is that people with MS live near normal life spans. How they can say that I have no idea since the CDC does not keep statistics on people with MS. A very good friend of mine just lost her mother who has MS. She was 77 years old. I have had MS for 20 years.  Some of the people in the MS group that I used to attend were older than Father Time. So I wouldn't get concerned about checking out early. The chances of that are extraordinarily slim. You take good care.
GApjwrnJaa	Okay, just to clear some stuff up to the people who have already answered this question, precum can contain some sperm, but often there isn't any at all. Precum exists to get the male ready for sexual activity, which means it cleans out the penis to remove traces of urine, or other sperm, which is why precum MAY contain sperm. If there is sperm left over from a previous ejaculation, THAT is what the precum contains and THAT is what could get you pregnant. If, however, the male urinates after previously ejaculating, most of the traces of sperm that could be left inside the penis are gone. Precum itself contains no sperm, its whats left inside the penis of a previous ejaculation that could get you pregnant. There is a VERY VERY small chance that you could get pregnant from precum, but the risk does exist.<br>  <br>  Now, someone said your cycle doesn't matter since you can get pregnant at any time of the month. While this is true, you have a more likely chance to get pregnant when you ovulate, seeing as your body is releasing a new egg. On your period, you have a less chance of getting pregnant because your body has destroyed the egg. However, your body can release and egg even while you're on your period, hence the chances of you getting pregnant on your period. The chances of getting pregnant on your period are next to impossible, but as i said earlier, the risk still exists. <br>  <br>  And everyone should know that the pull and pray method (withdrawl), while not a super affective way to prevent pregnancy is sure a hell of a lot better than having him just finish inside you.<br>  <br>  So, yes you could get pregnant. Just go to your pharmacy and get plan B. And please please please use a condom next time, or at least go on some sort of hormonal birth control so you don't have to worry about it as much. Take care.|`|nKSmgjylaa	So you're 24 and haven't heard of PRECUM? Pull out isn't a method, it's a lazy way of tricking yourself. You're preggers hun, sex = baby.<br>  Good luck.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	I'm telling Mom..|`|6qsocyK3aa	What stage of your cycle you're at is irrelevant. You can get pregnant at any time, even when you're on your period. <br>  <br>  The pull out method is very unreliable. There is very high chance that sperm is inside you because, even if he didn't ejaculate inside you, there is still sperm in his pre-c*m. Even if it didn't get inside you that way, if it was on his fingers and he stuck his fingers inside you, then yes, you had sperm inside you which means you're very much at risk of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Please be responsible and get the morning after pill AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. It can be taken within three days of the unprotected act and an IUD can be fitted within five days.|`|7G4hisdzaa	The pull out method isn't a method at all.  Men excrete semen long before they actually eject. <br>  Not to mention that him actually putting the semen up in you is pretty good grounds for pregnancy.<br>  If you don't want to be pregnant I suggest you go and get Plan B.  It is now available otc and it's your best shot at preventing getting preggers.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	probably about an 80-90% chance that you will become pregnant,<br>   since you arent  using birth control.<br>  <br>  if you dont want a child right now, why dont you think about Mirena IUD.

The best choice is to use an over the counter contraceptive called Plan B. its not the abortion pill and wont work after 72 hours. Also start using birth control or condoms nothings worse than an unwanted pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Best of luck <br>  -kay

OQ5HAfyIaa	Acne|`|jcy1Mssxaa	I'd say acne, and athlete's foot.
sw2R5A9iaa	yes -by xray, CT, and MR.  this can be a fatal diagnosis.|`|MAMnNfunaa	It can be identified on a cat scan or an MRI but not on a xray.|`|N6UmamQTaa	I would go with the xray first. MUCH less radiation exposure than the CT, and a lot faster than the MRI
ZuYTZ80Gaa	Yes a volvulus (twisted bowel) can be seen on XRAY.  I believe it's the double bubble sign.  You can also use CT/MRI, but since Xray is fast/quick it's usually the first thing done.<br>  <br>  This is a surgical emergency and if you suspect your child has this, they should be going to the ER immediately.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Why? Do they want to do exploratory surgery instead?
fmHyfVmVaa	Yes, more than likely it will be detected by MRI, because the bowel will swell & there will be gaseous distension behind the twist or loop. If you think this is happening go to the ER now!<br>  Good Luck & Blessings!

XB9VDLGSaa	No, 5 or so cigarettes a week is not dangerous.<br>  <br>  However, I would try to picture myself exactly one year from now how many cigarettes would I be smoking then.  If the answer is looking pretty high, then maybe I should stop altogether (because only 5 per week is so little) and I don't want a snowballing smoking problem.<br>  <br>  However, if I am still smoking 5 per week one year from now, then there is no problem with an increasing dosage.<br>  <br>  It is all about self-control.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Probably not, except that it will probably make you want to smoke 5 or so a day, then ten or so per day.<br>  <br>  It's a negative to your health, but probably not a huge one, if 5 or so per week is your limit. If you're inspired by the people you're around, then you're probably around enough smokers that THAT is a negative, however.

PCsW0gbPaa	1.) Acai berry doesn't really do anything.  It's just a fruit.  It is high in anti-oxidants, but so are other fruits and veggies, or for that matter, vitamin C pills.  It is not that dramatically higher in anti-oxidants than other fruit, especially for the price.  <br>  <br>  2.) Most Acai berry supplements contain a miniscule amount of Acai, even the juices.  You would get much more of those anti-oxidants from a handful of blueberries then from a does of Acai supplement.  In Brazil, people eat whole bowls full of the berry pulp, and they don't experience any cancer cures or weight loss or anything.<br>  <br>  3.) You can buy Acai juice or supplements in a regular grocery store.  I've seen 12 oz containers of juice for less than $5.  All of these web sites and MLM distributors are charging exhorbitant prices.<br>  <br>  4.) It's such a common scam for them to get your credit card number and charge you for nothing that I wouldn't take the risk on any web site or 800 number at all.<br>  <br>  5.)  The claims of celebrity endorsement are false.  Oprah Winfrey has never endorsed Acai berry.  Niether has Rachel Ray, nor any other celebrity.  If they lie about that, how much do you think you can trust their business practices?|`|0ab6fc7bd98309110aaef7ff59e4615caa	The best thing to do is go to GNC store to buy acai berry.  They have a lot of them so you dont have to worry about online.  I wouldnt trust online.  Good Luck!|`|Cbb2L2Xnaa	I take Acai berry now and I love it! It has really improved my mood and that has helped me stick to my diet. I have lost 20 pounds in 2 months from a combination of diet, exercise, vitamins and Acai.  I wouldn't stop taking it for anything. I did get scammed buying off the internet and wouldn't do it again.  What I suggest is going to your local herb shop and see if they have Acai berry juice from Genesis today.  It is what I use and think is the best.  If you would rather take pills they should have those too, but they are not as good.  The bottle from Genesis Today runs about $40 for 32 oz and should last at least 2 weeks depending on how much you drink. I suggest 1 oz at breakfast and 1 oz in the afternoon.  I have recommended this to many of my friends and all of them say that they had a noticable increase in energy and overall well being.  Hope this helps you. It really is just my own personal experiance, but I love the stuff!|`|tcimGBFeaa	I tried the product, I didn't notice any difference with it, if you do like it but don't want to pay so much call them to cancel your order and they will offer the product at 8.81 per month in stead of 69.95!

HpWCjBv6aa	Absolutely!  Especially for young people, alcohol is destructive and unnecessary.<br>  <br>  Drinking and smoking weed are both horrible for you and your health, so what does it matter which one is worse?  If you're concerned about your health and well-being at all, you won't do either of these substances.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Lots of drinking is corrosive and damaging to your body, yes.  It all depends on how much you are drinking though-- if you're drinking occasionally, IN MODERATION, then no.  It doesn't cause any significant health hazards directly to your body (this doesn't count drinking and driving or dangerous stunts as a result of drinking).  It does put strain on the liver. There are mostly just long-term effects.  It can also be very controversial; red wines thin the blood and aid in circulation but they are also shown to increase the chances of breast cancer, etc.<br>  <br>  The same thing goes for smoking marijuana, there are not short-term affects, mostly long-term.  Although, I do believe, the health hazards of drinking are far worse then smoking pot.  In studies on rats, after being exposed marijuana smoke for a whooping 30% of their life they experienced slight memory loss.  So smoking in moderation doesn't produce any significant health hazards either, and less short term ones.  (You can't overdose on weed, it doesn't cause any harm to organs, it aids in oxygen and blood circulation so there isn't any *KILLING MILLIONS OF BRAIN CELLS* like you may think).<br>  <br>  I would really look into the specific effects and if you are looking into experiencing either of these, make sure you are in a safe, secure place.|`|mzN3hlb9aa	no der sherlock, one tequila 2 tequila 3 tequila 4!|`|3rbjxxCnaa	Ok if you drink occasionally and not get super trashed than you will be ok it not like smoking weed and anyway weed is a natural it doesn't harm you either some people are just super up tight and make a big deal about it...

Generally, if you are worried or concerned about its affect then do not do it.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If your body develops the need for it, then it's bad. (aka addiction)<br>  Having a drink every once in awhile is not bad.|`|WpGROxH8aa	If you drink a little bit, its not going to be bad. But if you frequently drink in excess it can cause serious liver damage, among other things. There's also the risk of becoming an alcoholic, which is obviously bad. And drinking too much in one sitting can cause alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal. A person also makes worse decisions while drunk, so can end up doing dangerous things, especially if the drunk person gets behind the wheel of a car.<br>  Underage drinking is even more unhealthy because young people's bodies are still somewhat developing. <br>  But as an adult, occasionally drinking small amounts of alcohol is usually perfectly fine.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Anything that gives you some sort of "high" is not dangerous on itself.  It's when you can't control it is when it becomes a problem.  Whether it be over dosing on it, or just getting addicted, it's all up to you whether you can control it or not and whether or not it becomes a problem.

A little wine now and then is GOOD for the liver and kidneys.  It helps to clean the blood.  But some people have a genetic (call it an allergy) intolerance to certain forms of alcohol.  These people should avoid alcohol of any kind.  Drinking in your middle age can lead to hypertension and high blood pressure.  This in turn leads to other ailments.  The alcohol displaces water in your body and needs to have that water replaced. (this is what hangovers are.)<br>  I myself enjoy a good martini or a cordial from time to time, but moderation is clearly the key point. and recognize if you have a problem with it.<br>  Is it worse than marijuana? No, I tend to believe that marijuana is, because it is smoked.  The ash is still a carcinogen and increases your chances of cancer.  Also some people do form addictions to marijuana.<br>  Anything that strains your bodies organs can cause harm, but a healthy body will heal the damage.  When the body becomes stressed enough it takes longer to heal and fast moving maladies have an increased chance of causing greater harm.  If you engage in drinking, it is important to have that extra exercise to purge your body of the toxins formed and/or released by the presence of the alcohol.<br>  As for killing brain cells, both will.  The act of "getting high" gives off an intense euphoria due to the death of brain cells.  Gitting stoned or drunk is dangerous, impares your ability to make good decisions and becomes even more dangerous.

GBG2hbQ4aa	Food stays in the upper part of the stomach (the fundus) for up to an hour; it then enters the lower portion of the stomach, where it can stay for up to 2 more hours.  It enters the small intestine, which is where the body absorbs the nutrients from the food.  Lastly, it passes into the large intestines.  In a typically healthy digestive system, the whole process takes roughly 20 hours.  So you are eliminating yesterday's food wastes today.<br>  <br>  Seeing undigested remnants of a meal is an indicator that digestion is not normal.  This is generally the result of an enzyme deficiency.  Enzymes are responsible for breaking foods down into their smallest molecules so that our bodies can absorb them.  Insufficient enzymes = undigested food.<br>  <br>  The rapid transit time is another indicator that your digestive system is not up to par.  <br>  <br>  The standard American diet (SAD) is full of processed foods and cooked foods.  These foods are deplete of enzymes.   Our foods should be supplying some enzymes to the body, but enzymes are only present in whole, fresh, raw foods....vegetables and fruits.  Problem is that we eat too many of these foods cooked.  As soon as food is heated above 114 degrees Farenheit, the enzymes are toast.  That means that most Americans are running low on enzymes.  Sure, the body produces some enzymes...but those enzymes were meant to take care of the many chemical reactions that have to happen in our bodies.  They were not meant to be solely responsible for digesting our foods.  So our bodies become deplete, and we start having troubles with digestion.  Over time, this leads to other health problems.  I won't elaborate.... way too much information.<br>  <br>  It's good that you noticed those undigested craisins.  You can start taking enzymes with your meals, digest and assimilate your food better, and be healthier in the bargain.  There are many on the market.  A formula that provides protease, amylase, and lipase enzymes is best.  (I prefer Daily Essential Enzymes by Source Naturals.  Buy them at your locat health food store, or online.)  Take as directed on package.<br>  <br>  Another supplement that is terrific for creating and maintaining healthy digestion is probiotics.  You can eat yogurt and get lactobacillus acidophilus (a single probiotic), and that helps.  But there are many other probiotics than just that one that are needed for a healthy digestive system.  Better than yogurt is kefir.  Find it in the same cold case with the yogurt at the health food store.  Kefir has ten different probiotics, so it's more beneficial than yogurt.  Or you can take a probiotic supplement.  Again, there are many to choose from.  The best (most viable) product is going to be one kept under refrigeration at the health food store (probiotics break down at room temperature).|`|aHER8myJaa	pretty fast I've eaten a giant burrito and had guacamole rankass farts within 20 minutes and dumping diarrhea within 45|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	Normally it does take longer than that, but not always.

xmibEEdcaa	Tricky call, here, because nasty headaches like that are usually a sign of nicotine overdose...but they can also be a symptom of nicotine *withdrawal.*  So you'll have to figure out which it is.  <br>  <br>  Are you still smoking, as well as taking the gum?  If so, then you're almost certainly taking in too much nicotine. Drop the cigs, or if you can't quite manage to quit the cigs yet, then drop the gum -- or at least move down to a much lower dosage.<br>  <br>  Are you using the gum in the right way?  You're not really supposed to chew it constantly so much as park it in your mouth after the first few chews, to let it release its nicotine gradually.  If you're chomping away at it like you'd do regular gum, then you're likely getting too much nicotine released too quickly into your system, which would definitely give you headaches.<br>  <br>  If you have stopped smoking and you're sure you're using the gum right, then you'll need to figure out whether the problem with the gum is that it has too much nicotine, or too little.  Do you feel "nic fitty," the way you used to feel when you desperately needed a cigarette?  Do you have the agitation and the clenched jaw and all that?  If so, then you probably need a higher dosage gum.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure, then try experimenting with a lower dosage gum first, and see if the headaches go away.  If not, then maybe you need a higher dosage.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is whether it's the gum chewing itself that may be triggering your headaches.  Have you been a gum chewer in the past?  Chewing gum can be hard on your jaw, especially if you've ever had any problems with mild TMJ, jaw popping, etc.  That could be causing your headaches as well.  If you think that might be the problem, you might be better off switching to a different kind of NRT, like the patch or an inhaler.
yLoaUH12aa	no. Generally guys start shaving while their beard is still coming in thicker and coarser.

WHY ?? So ok get that first one out of the way after 30-45 mins then there are other things that can be done "in the time it takes you to recover" if you know what I mean - there are no rules to sex (except respect the word "no" regardless of yr age)  so use your imagination and if it feels right go with it.  Then when you are recovered and ready again it will automatically last longer. Why do men think that thay should just be able to go for an hour and a half "banging away" - we like other things you know and you banging away on top thinking you are satisfying her may just be having the opposite effect ! When it happens just say - that's round one started and now that allows me time to concentrate on you in the meantime.  You may even get 2 or 3 in - now where' s the problem with that and all the mechanics of it all in the meantime hey ???? Have a good weekend but DON'T stress about it.

43eUq8hOaa	because when a drug first comes out,they give it a name.They own the patent on it and make lots of money.Then,after the patent is "expired",the other drug companies are allowed to make the drug,which is labeled with the ingredient.There you have the cheaper,generic form.It is all about money.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Because they're both the true drug. When you're paying more, for the most part you're just paying for the brand name. That's about it. There's no patent on ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and with that you really can't change it's chemical structure (hence the drug itself) without changing what it does.<br>  <br>  In reality, both are the exact same thing. If you pumped both through something like a mass spectrometer, you'd get the same chemical components back.<br>  <br>  So What your pharmacist is doing IS just saving you money. On top of that you ARE receiving the true drug, just under a different brand name. It's the EXACT same thing.<br>  <br>  If you're finding big differences between the two, it's because of a placebo effect. You think one will work better so you act accordingly with your body. ^_^|`|WUfJaIOHaa	There is no difference between a brand name drug and a generic brand drug.Federal law say they must be the same. And even some of the same companies make the generic drugs as well as the name brands.Like the last comment on here said...you are just paying or the name.But however,there IS a difference between ibuprofen and acetaminophen.Ibuprofen is not as hard on your liver as acetaminophen ( Tylenol ).They break down differently and the effects are a little different. I prefer Ibuprofen myself.It works better for menstrual cramps and other things and the side effects are not as bad in my opinion.

8asG4WCwaa	Cuurently, insulin can not be taken in pill form because the digestrive acids of the stomach will break it down and render it useless.<br>  <br>  There is research going on to make an insulin pill, oddly enough with a special type of tabacco plant.  The genes for insulin have been added to the plant, which the ground leaves (formed into pills) have the potential to make it past the stomach before the capsule and plant matter are broken down.  Not all leaves produce the same level of insulin, though, so batches lots of different plants have to be mixed and tested. So far, it looks promising, at least with the diabetic lab mice :-)   It will be several more years before they work out the batch problems and can apply for human trials, and if those go well, a few more years before it can be on the market.  It will be expensive when it comes out because there are not enough plants to meet the number of diabetics that would want it and it is only one type of insulin (intermediate acting).|`|AA10450066	Because of the fact that your pancreas isn't producing any insulin at all it has to be introduced into the subcutaneous area of your body.If your body produced some insulin, but not enough, then there are oral pills that can be taken.|`|pTjEof56aa	Insulin is absorbed in fat tissues,why else would the pump be in my side.I have a diabetes pump and it injects insulin into fat tissue not the blood stream.If you have insulin in your blood stream your blood sugar would drop extremely fast.When you change the pump site to the same spot repeatedly,its not absorbed as well as it normally is because there isnt the fat to absorb it.And to answer the question your body would break down the insulin with acids.What if you have a cold too?There are fluids in your mouth that go along with the insulin.So insulin would be blocked and your blood sugar would be going wild.|`|AA12358000	Sim,<br>  Contrary to the answer given by Namairb2, above, insulin can not be taken by mouth because the digestive juices in the stomach destroy it. And Alexis M, Insulin is injected subdermally, into the fatty tissue, NOT into the blood - which would be dangerous.[Answers like these are the reason for my next paragraph]. This means that for most people it has to be given by injections. People with diabetes have three basic methods of how they get insulin into their bodies on a daily basis - syringes and pens (injection) and pumps (catheter). Most people find giving the injections simple and relatively painless, since the needle is so fine. Many have found that utilizing the pump helps to more tightly manage glucose levels, but others have not liked having something attached to them constantly. <br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

Then tell him after that you will come back for a full mouth xrays (bite wings and a full mouth exam and cleaning of course).

GBG2hbQ4aa	Neck pain can be caused by many things...a pulled muscle; overly tight muscles that hold the neck vertebrae too rigid; or one or more vertebrae that have moved out of alignment.   I get what the  chiropractor calls 'soldier's neck'....when the neck vertebrae line up in a very straight line.   Normally, the neck has a natural curve.  <br>  <br>  They sell neck pillows that are helpful.  You can make a makeshift neck pillow by taking a towel and rolling it into a roll.  Too big or heavy a towel will creat too big a roll and it won't be helpful (actually can cause more pain).  If you have a well-worn bath towel, that would be the best choice.  Roll the towel.  Have your mom lie on her back with the towel roll under her neck.  Adjust the towel as needed for comfort...if it's too big, unroll and fold differently to create a smaller roll.  If it's too small, unroll and refold to create a bit bigger roll.   <br>  <br>  The neck roll can be effective on allowing the vertebrae to move back into a more natural position.  It also puts the neck in a more neutral position, which can help with the pain.<br>  <br>  Certainly, if it continues to cause her misery, she should be seen by a doctor.|`|V0RhKsZiaa	Her neck has probably just popped out of place. If she knows how to crack her neck the pain should go away if she cracks it but that doesn't feel to good. Some really good muscle rub should help it feel a little bit better, because it heats up and then cools back down for the muscle to relax. You should try that for maybe a day or two and if that doesn't work try going to the doctor for a x-ray...I hope i helped you and your mother....best of luck!

(:|`|BRDqfAy3aa	see below all causes of missed periods (ignore pregnancy) and causes of irregular periods|`|JrcmZzdLaa	DON'T WORRY! itrs probibly nothing serious talk to your doctor|`|U5iot8qfaa	see you gp its not normal, (if you are not pregnant)|`|EXq2QYqOaa	You're just irregular. Perfectly normal. If you go several months without a period, then see a doctor. You're still pretty young, so your body is still modifying itself for you to menstruate on a regular schedule.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	You're still young - & if you only started in the last 2 years, it'll take time for them to settle into a pattern. If you're worried, go to your GP.
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, you need to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they think could be going on to see if it is something like bronchitis.
UVnr7wrmaa	I'm in exactly the same problem as you! I got mine January 2008 and they're still not giving any sort of 'pattern' or 'schedule' whatsoever.<br>  <br>  In my annoyance over this, I have done a great deal of research. In the first 1-2 years of your period, you're still going through puberty and your period doesn't understand when to come. Over time, though, (1-2 yrs) it should begin to develop a regular pattern. It's normal for everyone who gets their periods.<br>  <br>  And you can eat or not eat, and it won't interfere with your periods. <br>  <br>  I hope I've helped you with this!|`|a3bq277Gaa	Eating doesn't really mess up your period. Unless you lose or gain.<br>  <br>  Your period will be messed up for the next couple of years. Get used to it. Lol.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	Not eating DOES affect your period. However, you are only one year into it. It can take YEARS for it to finally regulate.
ymqL0Zeoaa	thats a little late and yeah i'd be a little concerned about it. call your dentist and let him/her  know about your dauhter. check this website out. <a href="http://www.rogerknapp.com/medical/teeth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rogerknapp.com/medical/teeth....</a>|`|6QC4NRu2aa	no..if she dosen't get it by age 4 then be worried.|`|d442bb19c50d42a1e21f5b79e0056189aa	Has she gone to her pediatrician recently? Was anything mentioned at her 1 yr check up? I would assume she will get a 2 year checkup. At this visit bring it up to your doctor about it. They may suggest you take her to a children's dentist for xrays. Believe it or not some kids are not born with baby teeth. <br>  <br>  The young actress Dakota Fanning I believe had a condition where she didn't have enzymes in her cells to break down her teeth therefore her teeth would not fall out. I think she needed to have a lot of her baby teeth pulled and she talked about a chain she had to use to pull her permanent teeth through. And a little girl I know at 6 was just told she had no permanent front lateral tooth.<br>  <br>   ou may want to find out why she doesn't have any teeth at 20 months bc by now she should be getting ready for 2 year molars. I nanny for a 12 month old and he's got almost 8 teeth already! So next time you take your baby to the doctor I would suggest mentionin it to them.
d8UjaIEmaa	Very normal. Many girls have this. Some woman have both of the labia minora long. Not every womans breast sizes or noses are all the same. This goes for the labia too. There is something called labiaplasty to get rid of it. However, this is only reccomened if it bothers you and if it hurts. I have it too and it really bothers me. It really hurts me sometimes. If it doesn't hurt you then just be happy and leave it. I promise that you're normal.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	I think all vagina's are sexy....|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	This area is similar to the scrotum of a male.  Also not equal on each side.  While you do not have testicles inside them the tissue is identical.  In fact males and feamles are formed from the same mold.<br>  <br>  You have a penis and a foreskin too.  Just like us.  Your condition is like us this way.  Normal.   Check your boyfriend out next time.  One testicle is bigger and the other is smaller.  One is high the other is low.<br>  <br>  Nature designed it this way.  Testicles are temperature dependent.  By having a high and a low one a male can produce offspring in cold climates as well as warm ones.<br>  <br>  Our requirement in this area leads to your discovery.  Blame it on us.  Its the male's need to have this tissue be offset that  is causing your issue.  Cool hu ?   One Gene could have made you one of us.  <br>  <br>  Instead of flushing and egg in a period you would have daily flushings and of 8 million of them each time.  We have a period just like you, but ours is many times a day and much more fun.<br>  <br>  Hope this is your best answer.|`|hv2nmmrqaa	Yeah its normal. I personally wouldn't be put of even if it was fairly noticeable i mean there's nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  Really not a cause for concern.|`|aHER8myJaa	it's about as normal as boobs not being the same exact size or shape... which is pretty normal.

V9NGGPP5aa	Its too personal and subjective to comment upon but waiting till mariage is good option.<br>  Still if u cant control take help of Condom which is safer & without side effect as compared with other contraceptives.<br>  And the answer to ur question is, as we think of only age its obsolutely safe at this age if u take above care<br>  good luck|`|th45yP4Xaa	Actually, the legal age is 18.

That's why protection is offered to everyone especially those who aren't ready to have a child.<br>  <br>  at 16 there's more at risk like becoming a parent unwillingly. But at any age you could catch an STD that could change your life forever.<br>  <br>  Not all STD's can be cured.

The more people you bond yourself to in life the weaker the bond will be. If you are lucky enough to wait and find the right person to marry, then have sex, it will be the best thing to ever happen to both of you.YOu will continue to grow in your attraction. (The same principle holds to highly addictive and brain altering Porno) Don't take it casually like eating food or giving a massage. It's powerful and should be used responsible, unlike every other person who throws it around. It sounds like you don't know very much about it. I would read more about it and think about it until you rush into something you will want to regret. <br>  It is a big deal and don't let the careless people out there tell you different.|`|8BlsO3ncaa	Yes. Absolutely yes, if you feel ready. Just ensure that you use a condom. The sooner you start, the sooner you understand all the emotions that go with it. Then you can get on with your life, pursuing your ambitions, knowing that sex is a pleasure that's there if you need it.|`|FND7XWLxaa	Depends... having sex at age 30 can be unsafe.<br>  <br>  If you so choose to do this... you better make sure you are willing to live with consequences...<br>  a) you can get/get someone pregnant<br>  b) you can get STD's STI's HIV some curable, most not<br>  c) If this person breaks your heart in a year, would you regret giving your virginity to that person?<br>  <br>  I would say wait until you are good and mature enough to make this choice so that you will have no regrets... and when ever you decide... use protection homie|`|6ri7AYC1aa	If it's the legal age of consent in your state. <br>  Also make sure you are educated about birth control, and make sure you use it too. And have a plan if there happens to be an unplanned pregnancy. <br>  But my advice is to wait a few more years before having sex.|`|V1SABIKEaa	I am also 16. It is very beautiful age. in this age create new ideas. so very carefully carry it. that is my idea.In this age is very main age of our life. so be careful to carry it.|`|db0NnEjGaa	YEAH. AS LONG AS YOU KNOW ABOUT STD'S AND HOW TO USE A CONDOM.... YOU SHOULD GO TO THE CLINIC FIRST AND BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARTNER SHOULD GET TESTED FIRST THEN TALK ABOUT SEX....USE A CONDOM!!!

KOYC3XkJaa	There are steps you can take to reduce your risk, but there is no surefire way to prevent it as it can be caused by many things, not just repetitive motion/overuse.<br>  Those steps are: <br>  Do not do one activity for too long. If while doing an activity you notice pain, soreness, stiffness, numbness, or discomfort in your hands or wrists, stop performing that activity. Switch to another one or simply rest. <br>  You should pause every hour or even every half-hour for a few minutes to shake out and rest your hands and wrists. <br>  Make sure you're using the proper form when performing your activites (ie when typing your wrists should be above your hands/fingers; that's what all those keyboard wrist rests are about).|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	This is an interesting question. I guess get one of those keyboard rests for when you type a lot, but as far as the violin and all that, I don't know.

SbGXZCrjaa	Why consider whether a guy will be disappointed?? who cares! If that's all he's interested in, then he ain't worth your time anyway.<br>  <br>  If wearing a padded bra gives you more confidence and makes you happier, then keep doing it. <br>  <br>  I know i do, gel bra's are amazing!!|`|557nSJb1aa	I have big boobs (DD cup) and still wear a padded bra because it provides a little protection (like if your nipples get hard 'cuz you're cold or something). It worked great during football practice, too (if I get tackled and my chest hits a rock it hurts less).<br>  <br>  It's actually quite normal. The only downside is if you switch to one that isn't padded people might get suspicious or if you switch to using one and you hadn't been people might get suspicious. So be careful. Also, some guys don't like girls that wear padded bras, but it's their loss, not ours|`|RYtqFntJaa	i love padded bras! they make me feel as if i actually have boobs.! don't feel alone because of wearing them! many girls do because they don't have enough or anything. it's your body. wear what you choose to!|`|uhnPQA9aaa	Most wear them and it's okay, just don't over-do it, you want to look normal to boost your self-esteem, not get criticized.|`|xRVtS6yhaa	of course its okay just dont over do it cause then you can tell really fast|`|k1miPoECaa	Dont worry, you'll grow and when you do it will be kind of a pain.

The fact is that as you are forcing the contents of your stomach out and if the force is great enough, then you could very well be hemorrhaging the tissue around your throat, esophagus, etc.  You could also very well have a bleeding ulcer as well.  The fact is that the acids from your stomach are coming in contact with your throat and the tissues in your throat and upper intestinal area, so it's easy to see that this could be an irritant that could be causing tissue breakdown.  Seek help for this and hopefully you will be able to heal yourself and find out why you feel the need to be bulimic.|`|833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	when you throw up, your stomach acids come up too. for most people they don't throw up unless they are really sick to their stomach for medical reasons, and so their throats haven't had a chance to build up any protection against this acid. if you're throwing up constantly, the acids are destroying your throat and that could be why you are bleeding. you should definitely see a doctor.|`|opInCvKSaa	If it is light and thin, brighter red(ish) in color that probably means you have a cut in your esophogus/throat/mouth.

mmMgfhf2aa	Could just be thrush. You can get cream and a tablet from the chemist (Canesten Duo) which will fix it. If it's not thrush and you're still sore it could just be a reaction to something that's come in contact with you. There are all sorts of things that can irritate sensitive areas... some toilet papers are scented (especially the more expensive ones) and some soaps, washing powders, sanitary products can cause a reaction. The best way to deal with these is to use vaseline as a barrier and try to keep anything fragranced away from that area.

You have nothing to worry about if she DOES take you to the doctor, though.|`|5C2B23Qnaa	theres know need to be worried. the doctor wont know anything, only if you tell him/her<br>  xxx|`|8ZPchcEgaa	There's no real way to tell whether or not your a virgin. Your mother needs to get a life and read a couple of health books. Sometimes your hymen can tear from having sex or being fingered. It can also tear from any vigorous activity such as sports. Maybe your mother is just trying to scare you. I can't believe any knowledgeable woman would actually take her daughter the doctor for this reason.|`|ybuk2DWlaa	straight up thats messed up of ur mom.. but i dont think theres any way to know. you can just say you "play" with yourself ha|`|1cDo3REBaa	there's no way to find out :S
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, this could be an indication that your period is changing due to your body going thru changes (an example only).  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
xNBFsEnsaa	Ok.

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	The most common option used as homemade teeth whitening agent is baking soda, which has a mild bleaching action. Given that it is used in baking, it also implies safety. Baking soda is sprinkled on the toothbrush, and teeth then cleaned using a gentle, circular motion. Care should still be taken though, especially for people with gum sensitivity. Old wives’ recipes often state that a paste of baking powder, a little salt, and a few drops of white vinegar, works effectively.<br>  <br>  Salt, used exactly as baking soda, is also touted as being a good teeth whitener. However, it might just be its osmosis, dehydrating action that makes teeth appear whiter, since dehydrated teeth look whiter. <br>  <br>  Lemon juice is often used, but it had high acidic levels, so teeth can weaken in the long run. Other natural, fruit options regard rubbing the inside of an orange peel on the teeth. A strawberry cut in half and the inside rubbed on teeth also works. Mashed strawberry can also be applied with a toothbrush. Apple cider vinegar is also said to be effective. Dried orange rind, and walnut bark, is also good.<br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Lemon juice, baking soda or baking powder can also be used for teeth whitening. Strawberries are natural teeth whiteners, simply rub them directly on your teeth or mash into a paste and apply.

He is also drinking 9.5 PH water. His wife has MS, and is also drinking the 9.5 PH alkaline water, and is doing much better.<br>  <br>  You can get free alkaline water - place a wanted add on <a href="http://craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://craigslist.com</a><br>  <br>  Here is a demo video to watch for the eczema cure as seen in Japan.

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	tell him and make sure he go shower before you guys are having sex. and then tell him you'd love to have him put on some deodorant on his body, for whatever reason it could be. like you think he would be really sexy if he put on the deodorant.|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	The truth of this is that a penis will smell like urine.  If you eat broccoli this could be a real bad thing.<br>  <br>  A male will smell almost exactly like a female in this department.  The smell is stronger in a male but for the most part the two are identical.  It takes people a while to get use to, but like beer everyone hates it till they get use to it.<br>  <br>  Incidentally his penis is cleaner then his mouth or yours.  In certain cases the smell might take on a very different foulness.  This could be a sign of a yeast or other STD.  For this reason, knowing the base smell of yourself, and your partner is very important.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you have a penis with a foreskin, he may or may not, but you will most certainly have both.  Washing is therefore important but not as required as you might think.  You are dealing with the cleanest part of your body and his.<br>  <br>  You hands and mouth a a million fold more infectious.  Sorry to break the bad news this way but as foul as it might seem, sex and those areas have a smell that only an established active person can love.  Young lovers always think its not pleasant. <br>  <br>  Older lovers are ok with it, and expect it.  Like a beer.  No kid likes it.    Yet look at the bar and 50% of the people there are loving it.  Your complete answer.|`|BUouJbTIaa	Dear you probably have the smell and is giving it to the poor boy. Its called bacterial vaginitis and it's making his penis rank with this awful foul smell.  So if you want to get rid of it for good wash your vagina properly with soap and water (some say you should not use soap, don't listen to them ,if you need it, use it) it should eliminate smell, so there should be no eye tearing odor before and after sex. ok..ok|`|PyNtY2Ataa	Or maybe you shouldn't be having sex before marriage.<br>  <br>  But jock itch comes to mind. A fungal infection.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are powders and cream designed to treat these infections. Its not classified as a STD.

But if he is circumcised he must see a doctor very soon it can be a fungi or growth!<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!!!|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	Probably a yeast infection. (yes males can get them too).

It's not just about aligning teeth it's also important to align your jaw! Only a trained orthodontist can give you the proper answers. Perhaps it's braces or something as easy as a fixed appliance.

qpmGLd7laa	I've had OCD my entire life, and I can tell you with certainty that you will only know if they have OCD if they want you to.  The disordered alphabets and numbers is a bad idea, because any snob may order them.  Watch out for things like ticks (slight twitches), tapping hands/fingers/feet on things a certain number of times, or if one foot taps something, and they automatically do the same with their other.....  if they run back to their lockers several times to make sure they locked it, or check over test answers repeatedly...<br>  <br>  People with OCD can be very good at disguising their behavior, because it's awkward, and they know it.<br>  <br>  If you've got more specific questions, email me.<br>  <br>  Why won't someone with OCD feel the need to order alphabets or tidy up all the time?  People with OCD have an overly active front brain, which is responsible for responding to error.  Surely, a disordered alphabet would seem full of error, but not necessarily to someone with OCD.  Remember, they feel that small things are erroneous that others would never consider, which implies that what others may consider erroneous is not important to them.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	ask her to tidy the class after lessons.|`|f3piRAuBaa	i dont think OCD is really a disease u need to look out for, but if ur actually testing for it try puting a bunch of misordered numbers or alphabets, or something that would c how obsessed they were.. if u dont want to test, just c if they're always organizing stuff, or putting stuff in order, or being sbsesed over how something isnt perfect..

VCIZJQCJaa	this is an acute injury,meaning it happened suddenly and not chronic-hanging around for a long time.i am guessing that you popped your rib or sternum I get this too.  when I sneezed my chest POPPED/SNAPPED  I felt fine then this discomfort started when i moved. My doctor says it's "normal". I know chest popping occasionally is NORMAL but not this discomfort. It's hard for me to sleep because it tightens up and feels like one side of my rib cage is trying to overlap the other side. Went to a chiropractor and he only seemed to aggravate the condition. I think I must have broken a rib connecting to the sternum when my husband tried to crack my upper back in "bear hug" position. I think he hugged a little too hard. I don't think this will heal unless I pop it into place and then lay there for 2 weeks. At least now I know to quit messing with it since it won't heal with my constant twisting and bending.... at least i can share how to sneeze properly cross your arms over your chest grab opposite shoulders -that's a fast way to prepare for a sneeze,and please try not to pop it it has to heal.one other concern is you have an infection so in your case i would go to the doctor and get it checked out and get some anti-inflammatory and maybe antibiotics,for the chills and fever you are trying to fight off.also get a note from your doctor to excuse you from P.E hope you feel better mine took a couple of weeks to feel better 4 months later it still hurts sometimes.|`|xmibEEdcaa	That cracking sound is the disturbing part.  If not for that, I'd suggest that your breathing problems were the first symptom of a nasty cold you've picked up somewhere, and that went pretty quickly into your chest.  With that cracking sound you mentioned, though, it's hard for me not to wonder if you could have somehow cracked a rib.<br>  <br>  In either case, though, the remedy is the same: see a doctor!  A doctor can determine if it's a chest infection or a cracked rib, but in either case, you need medical attention. If it's a chest infection, you'll want to go on a round of antibiotics before it gets any worse. <br>  <br>  Ask your parents to take you to see a doctor as soon as possible.  In the meantime, take some aspirin or Tylenol to keep the fever down, drink lots of fluids, and get as much rest as you can.

f8mLpPXlaa	Yeah, I'd go just to be safe. It could be just a little capillary hemorrhage now but they should take a peek. Some bacteria have a nasty way of eating away at mucous membranes and if they get to a larger blood vessel you'll get a real nose bleed. I'm not saying it even likely, just possible.|`|PiPorGh4aa	You should go to the doctor. If you are asking if nosebleeds will kill you, then no. I have suffered from chronic nosebleeds my entire life. When I bleed, it's really thick blood and I bleed A LOT.My entire shirt has been drenched before.|`|RMvGy2PGaa	If you're only seeing a small amount of blood, it could be due to something as simple as forceful nose blowing.  When you get a sinus infection, the bacteria tend to irritate not just the sinuses, but it can cause irritation in the mucous membranes toward the back of the nose.  You have a lot of small capillaries that supply blood to the nasal area and when irritated or inflamed they break open more easily.  If you are on antibiotics and you're not seeing much blood, you can probably safely wait another 24 to 48 hours before getting too worried.  Be sure to blow your nose very gently if you have to, and don't put anything up your nostrils, like tissue or nasal spray.  If you have a nosebleed that steadily bleeds for more than 10-15 minutes without stopping, go to the ER.  Hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  Jen
hidQnzfsaa	the sticky stuff on the tape, along with the perspiration and lack of air getting in there probably just irrated your skin.

9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, this can be reason for concern as this can be an indication that something is going on with the nerves in your fingers (an example only).<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.
BG8vMyZjaa	I don't think she can pass personal information to just anybody.<br>  Professional people such as doctors don't pass information on other than to fellow professionals and only then if it is relevant.<br>  Make an appointment to speak to your PO, do you have anyone who can be there with you?<br>  If confidentioality is being compromised ask to speak to a senior member of the department, write down what concerns you etc, so that you don't forget any points you wish to make.<br>  Again have a friend or relative with you.<br>  Sorry for your experiences so far.<br>  As for any surgery you might have no-one can refuse to give you drugs to relieve the pain after an operation.  that would be inhuman and against medical ethics.

BdlGBdE5aa	Bad breath is mostly caused by bacteria that live on the top of the tongue.  Sometimes you can see this bacteria as some white stuff on the tongue, especially on the back of the tongue.  The tongue cleaner on the back of the toothbrush does not get all of the bacteria because you cannot reach far enough back on the tongue.  You need to purchase an OraBrush tongue cleaner which is designed to clean the tongue, not the teeth as a toothbrush is.  Why do you think the toothbrush people placed a tongue cleaner on the back of the toothbrush?  It is because the toothbrush does not clean the tongue, neither does the back of the toothbrush.   If you are serious about getting rid of your bad breath then get the right tongue cleaner.<br>  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Gargle a cup of lukewarm water mixed with salt or half a lemon juice.This is  best done before going to bed.

hIAKXlsNaa	I have done this also.  What I try to do to hold me over in between meals is I prepare some carrot and celery sticks ahead of time.  Usually I do this on the weekends and just keep them cut up in the fridge so I can grab a couple to munch on.  I prepare them ahead of time because when Im hungry, the last thing I want to do is stop and take the time to cut up some veggies when its easier to grab a bag of chips or something.  Its better to have the healthy snack available when you get the bored eating cravings or in between meals.  Pick some of your favorite veggies, have them ready, also cut up some fruit so that's on hand for you to grab too.  Enjoy! :^)|`|jFqVKX7Vaa	Eat something light but with fiber. Fiber will help keep you full for a longer period of time. An apple is a great snack because it's light and it has a lot of fiber and actually helps you eat less at your next meal.
Zt6eh6VRaa	Sounds like you have inflamed acne which responds very well to benzoyl peroxide.  <br>  <br>  For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.  Then once your skin acclimates to this, then get a stronger benzoyl peroxide formuation – but make sure it doesn’t have pore-clogging ingredients in it. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. It usually takes a combination of a strong exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide to get clear. The other thing is to stay ahead of your skin's ability to adapt to products. If you use the same products in the same way your skin won't get clear either. You need to strengthen your homecare every couple of weeks - like using a stronger benzoyl peroxide or using the benzoyl twice a day.   If you want more help with this, we have a great long-distance client program that can help you get clear.  <a href="http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/longdistanceclients.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/lon...</a><br>  <br>  For free information about:<br>  <br>  1.

And I wouldn't exfoliate irritated skin every day like this?<br>  When you do that you dry your skin out and it produces extra oil to compensate. When you've got too much of that oil it worsens your acne and causes more of it by clogging up your pores. First off, try only exfoliating every other day or something?<br>  <br>  Tea tree oil is a good spot treatment, it kills bacteria and always worked better for me than benzoyl peroxide products. Just put a drop or two on a wet cotton ball and rub gently over the area. It stings a little but kills off the acne pretty well just don't use it straight its too harsh for that. <br>  I like Neutrogena products? I dont' think they're all that different from the Clean and Clear but the foaming face wash always worked well for me.

RHCUtrxnaa	You want to do it naturally? Don't smoke, drink, or do drugs. Treat your body well and be healthy. No "magic" pill will detox you. I like how you said you want to do it natural. If natural things were always good, then drugs and such that you've done would not have caused your liver to start to fail (yellowing of your skin and eyes- jaundice). Stay away from all herbal NON FDA approved medications. You do not know what you're taking or how they will affect you (they are not controlled, therefore can be anything). <br>  <br>  Exercise, eat right, and be healthy, that's how you can detox. Oh ya, you need to see a doctor ASAP for your liver failure!!! Yellowing is toxins in your blood building up because you smoked your liver during your partying years. The jaundice is not the drugs or alcohol, it's your liver dieing!|`|y1TDricRaa	there are other cleanses you can that do not require pills.

Try just going to a really good health food store and they can help you find a really good cleanse.  But because you were a drinker, smoker, and a drug user.

Here is some information I got about it off the web. You can buy it at any pharmacy.  It has really helped me with cold sores.<br>  <br>  L-Lysine benefits are substantial. What is L-Lysine? Simply put, L-Lysine is an essential amino acid. It is in fact, one of many amino acids that the body needs for constant tissue repair and for growth as well (especially for athletes and bodybuilders). L-Lysine in the body must be acquired from food and/or supplementation.<br>  <br>  Amino Acids are the core, building blocks of protein. In fact, protein is basically composed of amino acids. Their purpose and function is to assist in the growth and core maintenance of cells throughout the body. It's also a key player in production of hormones, antibodies, and enzymes. More amino acid information is here.<br>  L-Lysine Benefits: Functions & Benefits of L-Lysine<br>  The benefits of l-lysine are focused. Without any further adieu, here are the most significant L-Lysine benefits.<br>  <br>      * L-Lysine natural help for shingles exists. Shingles lesions are painful due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. L-Lysine appears to help treat the eruption of shingles. However, there still needs to be more research conducted to definitively proclaim it a major factor. Many have used steroids an antiviral drugs as well. Herbalists say it is helpful as well.<br>      * L-Lysine benefits include reducing the severity of herpes-related cold sores. L-Lysine inhibits the herpes virus. It prevents and relieves cold sores around genital areas, which are type 2 herpes as well as helping type 1 herpes, which is not as harsh as type 2.<br>      * Benefits of L-Lysine also include a role in promoting good bone health<br>      * As L-Lysine is necessary for collagen synthesis, it has a role to play in healthy skin, ligaments, and tendons.<br>      * L-Lysine also helps in the treatment and healing of general cold sores and canker sores as well.<br>  <br>  The richest sources of L-Lysine and the commensurate L-Lysine benefits are red meats, fish, milk, eggs, cheese, beans, lentils, peas, etc. L-Lysine natural help for shingles and benefits of l-lysine in general are found best in supplementation. In other words, enhanced amounts are more therapeutic. Currently, there is no RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) for lysine. However, estimates are 12 mg for every 2.2 pounds of body weight. For enhanced benefits of l-lysine, supplementation is recommended.<br>  Side Effects of L-Lysine<br>  While there are many l-lysine benefits, you need to be advised as to possible ramifications if there is a deficiency of l-lysine. Researchers say l-lysine deficiency is characterized by a loss of appetite, anemia, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, and even stunted growth in children. Bodybuilders and athletes should look to get 100 mgs per day for benefits of l-lysine to accrue. Avoid more than this though as a possible side effect of excessive l-lysine is gallstones. As always, pregnant and/or nursing women should always consult with their doctor before taking any supplement. Anyone embarking on a supplement program are advised to talk with their physician.<br>  How To Choose L-Lysine Pills<br>  <br>  To get optimum L-Lysine benefits, supplementation is recommended. Finding quality supplements, however, is difficult as there are so many dishonest companies out there literally selling hundreds and hundreds of supplements of all kinds and varieties. In order to make as informed a decision as possible, we recommend the following criteria that can help you save money as well as get the best L-Lysine supplement possible. Here's what to look for:
yotafojtaa	Sounds like you're unfortunate enough to have combination skin, like me lol. To help with the spot problem naturally, wash your face with cold water (no soap) every morning when you wake up, then apply the medication only to the areas with spots or where you have breakouts. Then if your skin is still dry, use the moisturiser. It's a chore, but has to be done. My skin was worse when I was younger, but now I'm 18 and just use a spot-on spot lotion to dry out the occasional spot I have, and it doesn't affect the rest of my face (I also have eczema so have to use moisturiser every day).<br>  Hope this helps :)

BTI0XOptaa	I am not sure what the smelly treatment is but  I can recommend some natural remedies. Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison.

fypgDK53aa	:) you're stressed. <br>  <br>  Take a deep breath, and do try to relax. You could be stressing yourself into nausea, which isn't entirely uncommon. As well, at this time of year, there are a jillion and one gastrointestinal bugs around, so it's possible that you've caught a mild one and are feeling its effects. Noroviruses and Roto- and Rota- viruses are everywhere, and very contagious. OR - you're just experiencing nausea from the Pill.. after three months, if you haven't had nausea before, it's a less likely side effect to be experiencing, but not unheard of. You can try taking your Pill just before bed to see if you're noticing the nausea as much - taking it then means you're asleep when you might be feeling sick. <br>  <br>  :) just relax. To every life, a little throwing up must come. Like I said, I would probably put my money on a GI virus causing you grief. The pregnancy tests and stuff are probably causing you stress... put faith in your Pills AND your ability to use a back up. Sounds like you and your boyfriend are using condoms correctly, so even without the pill you are at a very low risk of pregnancy. Perfect use with condoms can be ~2-5%. Add your Pill, and your chances of pregnancy would be very low.  <br>  <br>  NO MORE PREGNANCY TESTS unless you: miss pills AND something awful happens with the condom. You need to let your mind relax and know that you are being responsible. <br>  <br>  In addition to all this... the Pill can cause fluctuations in hormones, and some women may find themselves more weepy, emotional, and stressy. The Pill in some women takes PMS and makes it MUCH worse (convesely, some women find that it helps). Again, as you're new to the Pill, your body may be normalizing some hormones, and making you feel more upset than usual. Normal reaction. <br>  <br>  Breathe deep.. I don't know your history, but if you're using the Pill as directed, chances are you're not pregnant, and you need to put that out of your head. Head to bed early tonight, have a good sleep, relax a little tomorrow if you can, and your stomach issues will probably be better by Monday. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Sounds like your pregnant.

7ONKVbbiaa	you would be amazed at how many symptoms overlap, and if you see 5 therapists.. they can give 5 different answers. With my daughter, we had one therapist who swore up and down, that teens did not GET bipolar. Therapy did nothing.. until the psychiatrist went the opposite, prescribed for bipolar..and the world changed for my daughter.  <br>  What I am saying is that it is HARD to find a "right" answer, and there sometimes is not a right answer to find. Not only do you recognize your symptoms.. you now have stress of figuring out WHAT is it, becoming a symptom of its own!! <br>  Yes, it could be many of those, or none, or combinations. The one thing that I don't see is that many bipolars don't even see that they are unstable, they are oblivious. And I personally think intermittent explosive disorder is putting a symptom to its own disorder.. when it is common in bipolar. Racing thoughts also is common to bipolar. <br>  MY thought is that TRYING a medication such as lithium (which is the cheapest, and has been around for years).. would be logical. If IT WORKED.. then that would answer a lot of things. However.. a lot of professionals think that people are taking bipolar as a fad thing.. and won't attempt to treat it. <br>  Good luck...|`|PjGfy4Plaa	yep i no what ya mean bout the scattered thoughts and the crappy pschatrists im 15 and dealing with all sorts of "****" but yours sounds worse not sure what your asking cus you asking to many questions n stuff.like i nearly laughed when i read about what your doc said integrate into society then realised you were serious that your doc actually said to go out with your mind all over the place and stuff.<br>  have you ever think bout self harm well if you are dont trie it cus its like an addiction and you have scars for like ever and stuff.ok this is a crappy answer and its not even an answer to your question|`|e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	There is NO way anyone on the internet can give you a good diagnosis without 1. being a mental health care professional<br>              2. having therapeutic sessions with you to diagnose you<br>  <br>  Asking here on yahoo?

tVkH44yuaa	lifting weights everyday inst always good. b/c when you lift weights, your muscle cells rip and new cells grow over it, which makes your muscles get bigger. you should give your muscles time to heal before lifting weights again.|`|pquw7AdQaa	i think so!|`|MgMsMExPaa	You can work out every day just, just work different muscles every other day. For instance Work legs on On Mon, Wed, Fri, Arms Teu. Thur, Sat. You get the idea here. You need to allow each muscle to recover over two sleep cycles. So keep this in mind.<br>  You did not mention any supplements but they are important to recovery, so learn how to use them. They will reduce soreness and assist in firming muscles. Since you are using a bag be sure to use gloves, remember that you can weight these gloves for faster results in your arms.Watch your fat intake closely , since you goal is to firm up, not build. You really need to eliminate all fat if possible.  Stretching is important before a work out. Also look at doing palites or martial arts for the concentration and discipline. <br>  Drink water, lots of water. Sleep is crucial to success nap if you have to you absolutely must sleep for the recovery aspect to work. Do not drink alcohol, it is a carb, it also stops the absorption of some nutrients. Caffeine is also a problem for nutrient absorption. Also measure your results, make measurements of your chest, arms, legs,etc. These measurements will tell you how to modify your work out to prevent mass gain since you just want to tone up some. You also should look at swimming or bicycling or running as a weight loss tool to burn up some stored fat. Good luck|`|djNeNEOuaa	Your brother is right. You need to give your muscles two to three days to repair the micro tears that lifting causes. You can however still lift each day, you just have to target different muscle groups.<br>  <br>  Doing three sets of eight using the heaviest weights you can will build muscle mass, you might instead want to do three to four sets of ten that push slightly past your comfort zone, this will burn calories while causing less damage to your muscles, thus toning instead of building up that mass.<br>  <br>  For a good lifting and cardio routine to tone checkout this article:|`|AA10267654	You should work on only one or two areas of your body per day with the weights. The next day you should work on an area that you didn't work the day before. When you lift weights you create tiny tears in the muscle tissue (this is why you get sore) and the muscle needs a day to repair itself. So your bother is right. You need to make sure you are getting enough protein in your diet because this is what the muscle uses to repair itself. Good luck!

They may indicate a separate medical problem, one that may or may not be related to your cancer treatment.

I felt that way today (but not about the guy thing since I have been happily married 11 years this month.) There was a time I didn't care about guys at all in fact I hated them. I thought I might never get married or even have a boyfriend until I met my husband. I understand the feeling that we are doing all this for nothing. I go through that feeling almost on a 3 month cycle. Fact is, no one has the answer to that question and religious people have found a way to make themselves feel better about it by creating something to believe in. Something that gives meaning to their life. I have a good marriage and 3 great kids, but though we work so hard all the time we have little money, no home of our own and things always seem to go wrong at the most inopportune time.

87756LlTaa	200mg of seroquel is a fairly normal dose, so he'd probably feel drowsy or nothing.  800 mg of caffeine is equivalent to about 2 1/2 cups of starbucks coffee (16 oz each).  So he'll probably feel a little hyper.  Headache and sleeplessness will overcome the seroquel.<br>  <br>  Depending on his other health problems, the caffeine, especially if taken all at once, could cause a stroke, heart attack, or other ruptured vessels, like in the eye.  So...since these aren't predictable, and he either has suicidal ideations or simply doesn't care, you should call the emergency room, his parents, and /or 911.   NOW.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.  Get him a doctor now|`|3wDeS9tkaa	OKAY yeah 200mg seroquel is NOT a normal dose.<br>  <br>  i took 100mg for my rls one time and almost went into seizures.<br>  <br>  <br>  if your lookking to get fcked up.. don't take seroquel.<br>  its not recreational at all.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Aside from an extremely irregular heartbeat?

bIj65VE9aa	This sounds good but you are a little on the processed side.  Try to have more homemade items on your menu. <br>  <br>  I would lay off of the strawberry pastries and just leave a cookie.<br>  <br>  The grilled asparagus sounded nice but you grilled out the nutrients.  Try steaming it.<br>  <br>  I love perogee! ...but did you have potato-onion or potato-cheddar?  Potato-onion would be healthier.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't have the ham.  Try not to go too heavy on the red meat or just have it once or twice per week.  That would be healthier.<br>  <br>  I would lay off of the strawberry pastries and just leave the cookie.  One thing I do to ease cravings is drink very much water--it certainly fills me up! If you are really in the mood for a sweet, however, try some 100% fruit or veggie juice.  Sometimes I just chew gum. :-P<br>  <br>  That sounds good!  Remember, it always depends on quality AND quantity.

Both boys AND girls can have wet dreams. Boys frequently have them to release built up semen. They also have them when they have erotic dreams. Girls on the other hand can also have sleep emissions when they have erotic dreams. Their bodies just are not required to eliminate any built up fluids. When boys have wet dreams, they usually ejaculate enough to leave evidence that it occurred, but not always. Girls emissions can vary from none to extremely obvious. And then there are many boys as well as girls who can tell you that they woke up while masturbating, however girls are more likely not to share that information. At least with another boy. Boys who masturbate fairly often generally do not have very many sleep emissions.<br>  <br>  Whoever told you that only boys can have wet dreams probably meant that only boys bodies are required to eliminate the excess buildup of semen.|`|qJsfBCYEaa	Because we are much hornier than girls.

I commute to work in the nice weather and ride a bike on an indoor trainer in the bad weather.<br>  <br>  As for diet, I didn't "diet", per se, I just ate sensibly and controlled my portions.

No eating carbs after 7pm and eat healthy, bed early.. but that is about it. Do not be disappointed if you only lose 20 but what i told you to do, you can lose 10 pounds in one month.

ALSO IMPORTANT: do not use incline k? b/c your thighs will get bigger...try little to no resistance to get rid of that belly fat (which i'm sure isn't that bad hun!! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Being a vegetarian or even one that eats red meat or dairy like ONCE IN AWHILE is the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  <br>  Look, alright, im not trying to promote becoming a vegetarian, but here me out k?<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect and I'm super healthy and have tons of snacks to choose from<br>  <br>  Having a high protein diet is good in loosing fat, beccause the more protein is in a food item the less total fat and calories from fat!<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain,beans, or nut ailes<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  <br>  The entire Kosher aile has manyyyy products to munch on!<br>  <br>  Also, Some Kashi products are great to snack on!<br>  <br>  Try edamame too!- tons of protein and tastes delicious!<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you eat it): cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... ummm lets see, what else? theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of carbs in it depending on which version you get.

v9qNDFrsaa	Perhaps acid reflux?  I have had this problem on and off.  When I lay down at night, I get sick feeling and sometimes it feels like the food is coming up out of my stomach into my throat.  When this happens, I prop myself up slighty rather than being flat on my back.  Also, try to make sure you don't eat or drink for a couple hours before bed.  This might also help.|`|3a80a25db76852cdfe36f12bf54ce2b3aa	could possibly be caused by your inner ear do u get dizzy when it happens?|`|trxEyVRLaa	Well I doubt it's apendicitis but i'd ask a doctor.

KOYC3XkJaa	It's not anything to worry about. It's going to keep hurting for a few days and you'll get a massive bruise, but it's not anything serious. Ice it and if it hurts enough, take some painkillers. Don't take aspirin as it's a blood thinner and could lead to more bruising (and if you're under 20 you shouldn't take aspirin anyway).<br>  It's unfortunate that you had that experience. If you give blood regularly, do you go to the same place? Maybe you're familiar with some of the people there? If so, try and make sure someone you know is the one drawing blood, so you're sure they will do it properly. In your situation I think it might've been a good idea to notify or complain to the lady's superior. Not taping the tube down and moving the needle around mean she didn't know what she was doing, and her superiors need to be aware of that. Untrained or poorly trained people should not be drawing blood.|`|8RummmDaaa	Sue her!

Low cal, low fat, fasting, etc etc. I always gained the weight back. In December of 2002 I was watching a video that I happened to be in and couldnt recognize the person at first as I walked into the camera frame. I realized I had let myself go to the point of 260 Lbs. I read up on Atkins and on Jan 1st 2003 started phase 1 of Atkins. By June of 03 I was down to 215 lbs and have kept it off eating relatively low carb ever since. <br>  <br>  Just this year I went back into phase 1 to drop 15 lbs to get me to 200 lbs, a weight I hadnt seen since around 1992. The thing I learned is that a diet is temporary and you gain weight back. You have to change the way you eat forever, to really find that success and happiness. Its what we eat 90% of the time thats important..|`|RsrYLxw7aa	im skiinny<br>  always have been <br>  not skinny sorry <br>  more like fit[: <br>  anyways. theres your story<br>  im more of a weight gain cause i was wayyyy underweight as an infant<br>  doesnt that bring tears to your eyes?
BRDqfAy3aa	discover everything below - all needed information|`|5Hfxu3Kcaa	I think it is your period. We learned in health that your urine may appear bloody when you have your period because, depending on how you sit, the urine passes over the vagina and caries the blood with it.

a4IR6tYqaa	Odds are you strained the muscles and it should heal easily.  You can help it out by giving it rest for 48 hours and put ice on the painful area for 20 minutes.  After the 48 hour period is over you can try to stretch the area with gentle static stretching.  No bouncing and nothing past the point of pain.  Be sure to stretch the hamstrings, quads, and groin muscles.  Watch the lower back because sometimes when you hurt the leg you compensate for it and you end up straining the lower back.

wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers!

KL1Y5FeHaa	Do you have any pain in your abdomen, with the bloating. And weird bathroom habits like constipation? If so, it could be IBS. If not, sounds like it could be a gluten intolerance. Here are the symtpoms of Gluten intolerance.<br>  <br>  Diarrhea (probably the most major symptom).<br>  Anaemia (from poor iron absorption), along with low Vitamin B12 absorption.<br>  Weight loss (that may sound good for some, but in this disease it's not).<br>  Bloating<br>  Abdominal pain<br>  Vomiting<br>  Fatigue<br>  Breathlessness<br>  <br>  Go back to your doctor if you suspect you could have this. Several tests may be ordered, some of these are called lactulose intolerance tests, xylose absorption tests, and shilling tests. These tests can usually pick up on digestive malabsorption diseases. As if it's not gluten intolerance it may be something else. <br>  If you are diagnosed, you will need to alter your diet. They usually suggest taking a range of vitamins, depending on the damage to your intestine lining. (and I see you have been taking vitamins thats really good).|`|juhim6Bhaa	Yep. Sounds fun. You might need to do the failsafe diet. You eliminate pretty much everything with flavor. Then, you add the foods back by chemical groups. I bet it's gluten. Try a few days with NO bred, flour, pasta, anything.|`|qWOvlh4faa	Maybe you have a lack of some kind of vitamins?<br>  Try to eat eco-food a while, mabye that'll help.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0030f5e590ff16086572cdefc7f73ce4aa	icci that cool.
0RGt9r2aaa	high weights lower reps<br>  becuase since the weight is so high your muscle is being built instead of just toned. its lower reps becuase if you can do high reps than the weight isnt heavy enough to challenge your muscle to make it all bulky|`|a5MzSF5qaa	Heavy, low rep will build muscle faster. You force the muscle to cope with a heavy weight, so the muscle tears and repairs itself and becomes stronger faster. Light, high rep is a weight the muscle can already do plenty of, no need to bulk up, but increases endurance in the muscle.|`|84VU39Kcaa	tone = low weights + high reps|`|aKiFVbbKaa	lower weight/ higher reps with very little rest will bulk you up the fastest, because the stress on your muscles cause them to go into a state known as hypertrophy.  higher weights at lower volume will cause you to gain strength but you will not bulk up a whole lot.|`|B7fS9hWOaa	Higher weights lower reps definitely. Why IDK, but that's what all the trainers at my gym tell me is best for bulking.<br>  <br>  You also need a diet High in protein to bulk too.
kZ6N5odXaa	If you lose it on a HEALTHY and SAFE diet and exercise pan, then your skin should tighten with the weight loss. But if you lose it in a unhealthy fashion (such as starvation or extreme dieting), then you'll have saggy, unattractive skin that you'll have to do extra exercise to tighten it up.|`|AZILMgnQaa	Once you've grown a bunch of extra skin it won't just magically disappear.  If you're talking about liposuction or gastric bypass type fat loss, yet there will be extra skin.<br>  <br>  They can cut that off too in a later surgery though, commonly referred to as a "tummy tuck".|`|iRZMH4KHaa	It is possible to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and take on board that if you lose weight rapidly then you will probably put it all back on again just as rapidly. I lost 5 pounds in recent times when I had a special celebration to go to, and I did it by following the tips presented on the web resource in the box below.
AA11563237	There are several critical factors that determine your treatment of your sister:<br>  1. You need to determine if this is really a "blackened" burn. If the tissue is black, that indicates it is a third degree burn. If the skin is burned to that extent, the tissue is totally dead, and IV antibiotics are needed. You really should seek medical treatment if this is the case.<br>  2. How big is this injury? If you take your sisters palm, that size is 1% of her body surface area. If it is greater than 3%-5% and is second degree (red and blisters that have popped) or worse (third degree), once again, infection is a real problem and it is hard to control at home.<br>  3. Age. If your sister has sustained a second degree burn to 3% of her body or more, it is critical that you take her to a doctor. Pediatric patients are not able to fight infection like adults or large children.<br>  <br>  Having discussed the above criteria here is the treatment that you should follow to ensure analgesia (decrease in pain), and combat infection. Topical antibiotics, such as Neosporin, contain three antibiotics which can help prevent infection. Neosporin doesn't help with pain. You can give up to 800mg of Ibuprofen and 500 mg of Tylenol every 4-6 hours as needed. Along with the drugs, you can buy "solarcain" or something similar to this product. Just go to your local drug store and find something that contains "Lidocaine"(the drug used to numb when you get stitches). That drug only will last around 2 hours, and will need to be applied again. Also keep the wound covered with a dry, and sterile dressing if possible.|`|AZILMgnQaa	Yikes!  How big is the burn?<br>  <br>  Black = full thickness burn.  If it's the size of the palm of her hand or bigger she needs to go the ER.<br>  <br>  Most importantly keep it clean!  Infection is the major problem with most burns.|`|YbVFL3SOaa	Get your doctor to prescribe silver sulfadiazine ointment.  This will help the burn heal and help prevent infection.|`|e0da4J5Gaa	Aloe vera always helps.|`|h1eBWehMaa	put salt on it and then press an ice cube on it. it should help alot|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Aside from a cool wet compress do not put anything else on it.<br>  If it is blackened the likelihood of a small severe burn is evident.<br>  She should see a physician for proper treatment in order to prevent an infection that can result in more serious problems.<br>  <br>  good luck

If you take a look at this site at least it will show you the brushes you need. Also a mouth gaurd for when you play sport, how ever my daughter never wore hers.<br>  The toothbrush will have a normal brush at one end and a very small brush at the other end and it is this that you use to be able to brush under the wires of your brace to be able to perform propr cleaning and not break your braces.<br>  As for toothpaste just stick to a normal one with flouride and you'll need a mouth wash that DOES NOT contain alcohol, The alcohol is very damaging and cause your brace to break.<br>  Make sure you brush well and your teeth will be fine.|`|AA10363258	no regular toothpaste|`|V9iBKyh5aa	no regular is perfectly fine. except my ortho gave me a special toothpaste that helps prevent cavities cuz when someone have braces people tend to get cavities more<br>  <br>  good luck with the braces|`|A67zcJn2aa	Usually the dentist will answer all of your questions, but no you don't need to buy a special toothbrush or toothpaste. <br>  Good Luck with the Braces :D

Seems fine, you lose weight, but when your target is reached... "End of diet, no more gym. Ah, finally!" Some months later you are back where you started. To get slim and stay slim you need:<br>  <br>  1) A diet that you can live with, be comfortable with, and of course is healthy and makes you lose weight. A good tip is to have a day every (other) week when you allow yourself to eat some "forbidden fruit"..<br>  <br>  2) An exercise program that you can live with etc etc. Walk every day, or run, whatever. But enjoy it. <br>  <br>  3) Motivation, confidence, willpower, optimism, and general mental strenght. Because, believe it or not, you will never be "done". You need to change your lifestyle. Not too much at a time, but you will have to get a "healthy" lifestyle, and you must stick to it. It sounds impossible, but is not. <br>  <br>  Start walking every day. Eat normally. Then, when you feel ready, you start eating healthier (which does not have to mean "strict diet"). Don't make dramatic changes in your lifestyle in a week unless you think you can handle it. <br>  <br>  I have already written too much. The clue to lose weight, 100lbs or 10, is to change your lifestyle into a healthier one, and stick to it. Believe it or not, you will have a happier and better life.|`|c5ScseTdaa	Yay spam.<br>  <br>  I gain about 5-10 pounds every winter.  Winter is gross, and I haven't found a way to beat it.  Fortunately, it's just about over!<br>  <br>  Strict diets are rough, and research shows the results don't often last.  130 lbs sounds really reasonable for a girl who hits the gym 6x/week.  Do you have any idea how much all that muscle weighs?<br>  <br>  Have your body fat measured by someone who's properly trained.  Under 24% is great, anything approaching 18% is awesome, and less than that is okay only if you're an athlete--runner, swimmer, whatever.  That muscle is also harder to fit into your clothes, even if you lose more body fat.  For better or worse, muscle doesn't have as much forgiving "squish" to get into those tight jeans, so sometimes you just have to take your awesomely fit body for what it is and move on with life.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|MWGpl1SWaa	Talk to your doctor.

You can eat chocolate and chips on your days that you don't work out. But also try to substitute your  chips for a fresh fruit smoothie. It taste great and you know where its coming from. Your House.

v4EqZC3oaa	I have struggles with acne for years. I have tried so many products and i have been to the dermatologist many times.. will i have tried both perscription and over the counter the one that i have found that works best with my skin is the neutrogena skin care 3 step routine, you can find it in your local drug store or walmart. Its only 20 bucks and it has left my skin clear and soft. I still have a few breakouts every so often and i still have scaring from previous acne but it really has worked well in keeping my skin clear. I also scrub a couple times a week with the clinique face scrub. Its a little expensive but it is well worth your money. I have been using the same tube since december. Hope that helps some.<br>  <br>  if you want to try a quicker way you could do this: <a href="http://acnegonefast.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://acnegonefast.notlong.com</a>|`|Zt6eh6VRaa	I know that skin problems can be extremely frustrating, especially when you feel like you've tried everything and nothing works! I own an acne clinic and have helped hundreds of people to get clear skin (all around the world!).   It takes waaaay more than a cleanser to get acne under control. It takes using right products in the right way; and also, keeping up with the skin's ability to adapt to products that is the key.<br>  <br>  For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.  Then once your skin acclimates to this, then get a stronger benzoyl peroxide formuation – but make sure it doesn’t have pore-clogging ingredients in it. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. It usually takes a combination of a strong exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide to get clear. The other thing is to stay ahead of your skin's ability to adapt to products. If you use the same products in the same way your skin won't get clear either. You need to strengthen your homecare every couple of weeks - like using a stronger benzoyl peroxide or using the benzoyl twice a day.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|LDe9yzCKaa	do not use pills .. the day you get off of the pills, u will gain it all back twice as fast. just keep doing what u are doing... and make it a habit.

dtzlrB9Faa	Many Dr's. don't prescribe anti virals as they want your body to fight the virus.  If you just had one infection it's possible you have HSV1 genitally or one of the lucky ones that don't get many outbreaks.<br>  <br>  To lessen the risk of transmitting herpes first beware of your body and avoid sex if you feel you are getting an outbreak, take a suppressive while in a relationship and wear a condom.  I believe the risk factor is about 1-2% if these precautions are taken.   The tests for shedding were done with valtrex. <br>  <br>  As common as herpes is...I've heard it's often safer to have sex with someone that knows they have herpes than sleeping with those that don't think they have it but have never been tested!!!|`|C44Ux50paa	most herpes meds should be taken at the FIRST sign of an outbreak. or in bad cases, daily as a preventative measure. for your doctor to diagnose you and not give you medications was wrong! once you break out you'll have the sores for a long time.. once you break out theres really nothing you can do until they go away. you need to prevent them with meds! see another doctor!|`|9HoXpsP6aa	My sister has herpes.  SHe says she gets very tired, and achey in that area before an outbreak.  You should always use a condom like your doctor said, and if you think you may be getting an outbreak-don't have sex, it probably wouldnt feel to great anyways.  Also, kissing won't spread herpes.  However, if you did have an open soar, and then touched it and your mouth, then yes you could spread it.  Just use good judgement.|`|a0DejemNaa	Herpes has outbreaks, randomnly.<br>  <br>  THere are two types of herpes.<br>  One on the mouth, two in the genitals.<br>  <br>  Unless you have type one as well, you should be ably to freely kiss someone without transmitting herpes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try going to a different doctor and ask them your questions|`|DooLiXYSaa	Your doctor should have advised you to take a medicine like prescription Valtrex.  It is a medication that helps make the outbreaks less often and less severe.  <br>  <br>  It is possible to spread Herpes when you are not having an outbreak.  The chance is small, but is still there.  <br>  <br>  Using a condom is always a good idea, but sometimes the Herpes outbreak happen in places not covered by a condom.  You can also contract the virus by a sore that comes in contact with skin.  Be extra careful.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give is be very cautious.  Don't have sex during an outbreak.  Advise any partners in advance (I know, I know... but it is the responsible thing to do).  The risk of transmitting it through kissing is very small, but still there.  If you have Herpes Simplex II, you probably do not have the oral sores, but you can get them there through oral sex and kissing.. you get the idea.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and go to a doctor that will prescribe you the Valtrex!!

You can not hate yourself because you did what your country asked of you and what HE forced you to do.<br>  <br>  You need to deal with the feelings you have inside yourself about this incident.

Keep a good support network of friends and family. TALK about what happened. Bottling it up is never good.

Zt6eh6VRaa	For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.  Then once your skin acclimates to this, then get a stronger benzoyl peroxide formuation – but make sure it doesn’t have pore-clogging ingredients in it. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. It usually takes a combination of a strong exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide to get clear. The other thing is to stay ahead of your skin's ability to adapt to products. If you use the same products in the same way your skin won't get clear either. You need to strengthen your homecare every couple of weeks - like using a stronger benzoyl peroxide or using the benzoyl twice a day.

C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hi Ruth. I'm pretty sure you have aggravated your esophagus. The steps you have taken to push the crust down have done their job. Now it's waiting time.

No just kidding.  Any two gross things could make you vomit.  But there's never a guarantee.  You may wind up with diarrhea instead.  You could try urine and strawberry ice cream.  Or you could lick the sidewalk.  Or french kiss a dead raccoon.  Of course these things are dangerous, just like needless vomiting.  <br>  <br>  If you ate or took something and you think you need to vomit to get it up, then see a doctor.  Many medications are actually more dangerous if you vomit them.

1Qxe2Sjhaa	You are obviously getting alot of conflicting answers on your question but the truth of the matter lies in you. Are you comfortable with yourself at your present weight? That is the real question. If you are not the frst step is to see your doctor. He/She can tell you if your weight is considered healthy for not only your height but also your bone structure, activity level and medical history. That is the source you should go to on a question like this. There are all types of people out there that can give you advice that works for them but when it comes to a sensitive issue, you should see a professional. Be careful of falling into a "proana" lifestyle or mindset, I can tell you personally, it sucks!|`|xyMuLegIaa	Of course not.

AG9msdUDaa	It could just be an imbalance in the probiotics in your gut, and there is a treatment for that and the blood pressure: raw garlic. Eat it in every meal for at least a week to hit the issue hard so you can have a faster recovery. At the same time, start taking probiotics and eating yogurt with live cultures and no sugar. For the stress make sure to get enough vitamin D, magnesium, and a B complex along with fish oil.

Another problem could be that he perspires a lot, and his sweat may give out a nasty odor. This could be due to his diet. He also could have a bacteria infection hiding under his pubic hair.

IDE7f3kFaa	Yeah it will defiantly help you loose weight!  I lost 40 pounds by doing the same thing: watching what I eat and by running on the treadmill for about the same time.  If you truly want to loose weight start counting your calories and just make sure you are burning more calories than what you are taking in.  I promise you will see results and fast.

VVH1KWaaaa	try doing as many as you can without taking a break 3-5 times a day. this is for both pushups and situps. when you limit yourself to a certain amount or certain time you limit your growth. only doing it once also holds you back. this way there are no limits to what you will do in a day. this is also how i managed to max out those portions of the Army PT test. good luck.|`|JNDk1LUmaa	Start by doing military pushups: NOT on your knees, keep feet together, head up, back completely straight...and if you can't do one, you can drop to your knees for the first week, but you shouldn't ever have to do them on your knees after the first week, or you're not doing enough. If you can already do them correctly (military style) start with 15 pushups, 3 different times in a day.

GJKsizL7aa	Because they are divorced or their wife is dead?  There is no physical reason for men to stop having sex after 55.  The biggest reason for not having sex is loss of opportunity.<br>  <br>  A contributing factor may be a decrease in the sensitivity of their penis.  Over time, a circumcised penis loses sensitivity because the parts that are normally protected by the foreskin are exposed and rub against clothing. This condition is readily fixed by covering the penis with a special sheath (Senslip or Manhood) or by restoring the foreskin.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Poor health, bad diets, illness and disease; work overload and stresses (tons of THAT), worrying about performance, family, losing their jobs, the world economy, etc. etc.|`|ZXPXepumaa	Most men over 55 have sex.

87756LlTaa	I tend to agree...pot probably isn't as bad as it's made out to be.  <br>  However, it naturally contains 3 times the amount of tar as nonfiltered cigarettes, and it does cause lung cancer and emphysema at an equal or faster rate than cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Long term use has a few side effects, and they are often permanent, but not life threatening.  They reduce brain volume, which causes decrease in IQ, though it is probably only a very small amount.  It affects the way the body synthesizes hormones, and and testicular volume decreases. (I'm not kidding, smaller nuts). Fertility is reduced for both men and women.<br>  <br>  Another nasty effect:  it's illegal, and you can go to jail.  Right or wrong, that's what happens when you give the government the right to make it illegal.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Weed does have health effects.  The problem is, because it is illegal, there have not been nearly as many tests done to determine the effects of weed, and the ones that have been done are usually severely biased in one direction or the other.<br>  <br>  I agree that it is NO WORSE than tobacco or alcohol, and it is certainly less addicting.  But I will not vouch for its rate of cancer or other terminal illnesses.  Oh, and it DOES kill brain cells.<br>  <br>  The scariest part about weed is not knowing what is in it.  It could be poor quality (and you get ripped off), it could be laced with other stuff, it could contain toxic pesticides, or it could carry parasites.<br>  <br>  Grow your own, or know someone else who does.|`|AA11849364	nothing is"wrong" with it, if you are old enough to use it responcibly( I don't do it though, lol, I've got health problems).

Do you smoke it? Cuz it sounds like you've already lost a bunch of brain cells. Weed can hurt everyone. It changes you and you start to not care about anything anymore. Your grades go down, can't play sports anymore. You get lazy and careless. Attitudes change. Weed can kill you, seriously. It may not be your lungs but it WILL be your heart and your liver. My friend did it and became careless. Everyone around her was hurt and now we aren't friends anymore. I was trying to HELP her and she told me to f*** off. You see how it changes your attitude?

Obviously he couldn't get a prescription from a doctor by himself. If he is getting them from another student call that students parents, but for your child's sake keep yourself anonymous. If some kid gets in big trouble he'll be really mad at your son.|`|sAEYkNSqaa	I would be very worried about this situation, just to make sure i would take these pills to your local pharmacy to make sure these are not esctatsy tablets or any other drug, if your son has drug problems sign him up to a drug rehibalition course they give you the courage to stop drug abuse.|`|KgKVWv9paa	you are asking in the wrong place to get a solid answer....take them to a CVS or somewhere like that...ask your doctor.

QMAqzpKEaa	We have all these great scientists, artists, philosophers.. We fall in love with them and their ideas. They put out all these great works, and the world hangs on their every word. They get recorded in our history books, their ideas to influence humanity until the end of it's reign. Children sit in silent classrooms, memorizing and reciting each and every one of their laws and theorems, so that they hopefully may gain knowledge from those genius people, and have a greater understanding of reality because of it.<br>  <br>  Then those great men and women go insane.<br>  <br>  It's always the great ones. They start to harbor weird ideas that make no logical sense, cannot be proven by science, and have no rational basis whatsoever for why they're even there.<br>  <br>  So we throw them in a mental asylum.<br>  <br>  The people we clung to, the masters of the field, we now say we know more than. We lock them away, we do not allow them to ever influence our way of thinking again, and we only hope we can one day get them back to the "right way" of thinking. Our way of thinking.<br>  <br>  Tell me, though. Do either you or I fully understand the mathematics of the Big Bang Theory? No, we do not. But we believe in it.<br>  <br>  Do we understand what makes Picasso's abstract art so great? No, we do not. But we love it.<br>  <br>  We do not understand why they go insane, either, and while we readily accept their scientific theories and their masterpieces in art, we will not accept their new way of thinking. Why is this?<br>  <br>  Well, how often are new ways of thinking readily accepted? What is that old proverb..? "If you carry the truth, have a foot in the stirrup."<br>  <br>  When Copernicus told the thinkers of the day that we orbit around something greater than ourselves, that we weren't in the center of the universe, was it readily accepted? Of course not.<br>  <br>  Was Galileo accepted when he was forced by the Catholic Church to say his ideas were wrong, or otherwise face execution? Of course not.<br>  <br>  New ways of thinking are not readily accepted. Insecurity, perhaps, causes us to get defensive. We do not want to think that all we ever thought was totally wrong. If we are dead set going in one direction, though, and never willing to look to our sides.. Doesn't this mean we may be going farther and farther away from what we are supposedly looking for?<br>  <br>  So, when these great men go insane, and go into this "new way of thinking", do we accept it? Of course not, otherwise we wouldn't label them as insane!<br>  <br>  Tell me this, though. Does an insane person know he is insane? Not usually. To the insane man, he is living in a world of his own logic, laws, and ideas, and they make perfect sense to him.<br>  <br>  Tell me this, as well. Would it be logical to say that everything we see in the night sky is actually inside the Earth, and we are all living on the inner crust? It would not be logical. I do not believe it. I made that theory up just then. But think about it like this..<br>  <br>  When we thought the Earth was flat, it seemed extremely illogical to think that the Earth was actually round, with a whole bunch of people just hanging there on the other side. With what we knew, it was extremely illogical. Common sense told us that the world was obviously flat.<br>  <br>  But then we found out it was round, and common sense wasn't all that reliable anymore. In fact, it was borderline insane. Today, seeing the world as flat is borderline insane.<br>  <br>  If me or you were born two thousand years ago.. we would see the world as flat. If we were born two thousand years from now.. we might see it as, I don't know, square or something. We have no earthly idea. We change. A scientific law's lifespan is not that long.<br>  <br>  Does this mean that we could, in fact, all be insane.. living in our own world of logic, theorems and laws, that we've all just made up? The brain does try to create patterns where none actually exist, after all.<br>  <br>  And these great people, that we once considered the masters of understanding this universe, go insane and are considered back at rock bottom, with less of an understanding than even us. We try to tell them they are wrong by using the laws they themselves created.<br>  <br>  But, is that logical, that they would just make a leap like that? No. Did it seem logical to the ancient Mesopotamians that the Earth was round? No. But was it round? Yes.<br>  <br>  So, if a man came up to that ancient civilization and claimed that the Earth was round, would he be considered insane, even though he was right? Even though he harbored some secret truth we weren't ready to understand? Yes.<br>  <br>  So, couldn't these great men and women simply be delving into an area we have no earthly idea how to yet comprehend, a greater understanding of reality we just aren't ready for?.<br>  <br>  They, after all, were the masters of this way of thinking. Maybe they've moved on to something even greater, and we just aren't ready to accept it.<br>  <br>  Maybe, those clinically insane people we see in mental asylums.. have a much, much, better grasp on reality than we d|`|vzDgu1xkaa	I have an I.Q of 152 and I think your question is invalid. We don't turn to insanity. It is just that the way our minds think that people think we are weird. My wife left me because i made a new device for gardening and i was so excited. I was like "It works". It was a very hard device to make. (Automatic leaf blower powered by water) She thought i was insane and went away. We are not crazy. You may mean that because our minds are always buzzing with questions and answers which makes us a little delirious. So my answer is <br>  No|`|6qsocyK3aa	Yep, and it makes sense too. There's truth in the phrase "tortured genius". More simple-minded people - not that they're bad people or anything - don't have to deal with their own angst and they're usually more easily satisfied. People with great minds tends to think and analyse stuff a lot more which can drive them mad.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Cause they're too smart for their own good....I have heard that exact line used to describe a very brilliant friend of mine who tried to kill himself and ended up in some kind of crazy hospital<br>  <br>  They tend to overanalyze things, and get overwhelmed by it all.....which in turn makes them depressed or crazy.|`|Ch931T2daa	Because they know there write but human-kind isn't ready for there ways of thinking so from all the rejections and arguments theres only one way to go about it.|`|Leo4z1EFaa	i feel like this sometimes. my thoughts and what if's control my thinking and i just want answers! but im not too smart lol|`|RlzkeY0gaa	A lot of minds in general 'go insane'. Those who have great minds who go insane are just part of that group. Some claim there are reasons for it. I'm sure the added pressures of being that much better than others mentally would push some over the edge. Of  course, it is possible that their intriging minds were actually an early symptom. Wouldn't that be cool?|`|33e7be3a530c931434bd856caa33948eaa	cuz they're too smart for their own good.. My great uncle went insane because he was too smart

Just don't do it again and you'll be fine.|`|grPckwSsaa	yes if it is a urine test then you will be fine<br>  <br>  it takes about 30 days for thc to leave your urine|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	the body half-life for THC is 8 days- so a month should be enough to get it below detectable levels. <br>  Fat and meat in the diet won't do any difference- the THC is in your body fat (including the myelin in the nerve and brain cells) so it needs the time to leech out<br>  Just stay off such things in the future|`|uhEumaG9aa	hahah. the thc is out of your system, if it was your first time smoking then it only takes three days to be gone. stop worrying, you're fine.|`|j9axB0YMaa	Quit freaking out it's most likely already out of your system.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Just don't do it again and your system should be clean. ^_^|`|M2egBbbtaa	Get a time machine.

geJM58L2aa	If you rubbed your right eye and then rubbed your left eye, yes.  Or if you have used makeup recently that you used while you had the stye, yes. If you do use makeup, get rid of everything that has touched your eyes and don't start using new makeup until your stye is completely gone.  And as hard as it is, try not to rub your eyes and make sure to keep your hands clean!|`|Q8kwYzV2aa	wat the hell
GApjwrnJaa	Doctor's appointment are really expensive, especially if they're not covered by any sort of insurance. There's a reason doctors are some of the most paid people in the world.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	Yep. If you dont have insurance then you're screwed. Doctors are ridiculous. Sometimes there are free clinics around though... so check into that.|`|qAFhsdBxaa	It depends on your neighborhood and the level of consultation and if it was your first visit. $190 is not unheard off. <br>  <br>  Bear in mind that in California an Ob/Gyn may have to pay 1 million dollars just for the professional insurance, then they have to pay office costs and salaries. <br>  <br>  Covering these expenses means that the doc at a minimum has to charge around $1,000 an hour, so your bill is probably not that far off.<br>  <br>  If you are suffering financial hardship, I would call the office and see if they can't work with you. Most of the people in healthcare work hard to let people live healthily.

n4KKmEYTaa	I think green tea weight loss products are more effective so you can try some, if you want.:  <br>  <br>  In fact, researches and studies have found that this kind of herb contains antioxidants.

To this end you can burn calories more effectively. It can be considered a kind of natural fat burner. Besides, it can also help to slow down the oxidation process in your body. So, you can get more benefits than just fat loss.<br>  <br>  It will also be interesting to mention that this kind of herb has been used by people in Chinese and Japanese for centuries. For best results, you can consider taking green tea weight loss pills before you go sleeping. This is because our metabolism will tend to be slower when we are sleeping. Taking them before sleeping can help you to maintain a relatively higher metabolic rate when you are on the bed.<br>  <br>  It is very important for you to understand that taking green tea weight loss products alone is never enough. It is a must for you to take a healthy and balanced diet. Be sure to avoid junk foods. You should not eat foods such as fries and hamburgers if you would like to lose fat.

Im not fat but i drink green tea and i give it partial credit of making my abs more defined. Eat healthy tho and rest will come|`|LmicIEOxaa	Green tea  is one of several foods that do increase metabolism.|`|f05TawR0aa	It may increase your metabolism ever-so-slightly (though you'd have to drink about 6 cups per day just to burn an extra 60 calories, and bear in mind the tea alone will contain between 2 or 4 calories even before adding sugar or sweetener). The main benefit of green tea is its ability to suppress the appetite which it does quite well, so yes it may well help you to lose weight. Also it contains antioxidants which will improve your general health.<br>  <br>  The only drawback is that green tea tastes disgusting. Like, really disgusting. A combination of chlorophyll and urine. You'd be much better off drinking white tea, which has the same benefits but tastes nicer.|`|pquw7AdQaa	green tea will help your digestive system but to lose weight you should exercise and eat properly

At least that is what I heard about them looking for it.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	anything can come up from a blood test.<br>  <br>  if something unusual comes up then they will test it and find that it's marijuana|`|AA10723498	First of all, they have to tell before hand if they are doing a drug test.  If they are, then they will find it mostly in the urine.<br>  EDIT, If this is going to be just a routine blood work, then all they are looking for is healthy counts.  Like a healthy red blood cell count. a healthy white cell count. all the properties that are in blood.  They shouldn't be looking for drugs on a routine test, unless it's part of the routine testing, but like I said, it is the law that you have to told they are testing for drugs.  Good luck and good luck in college.  Remember to study hard, but have fun too.  It keeps you sane. lol|`|7bIrMvziaa	Yeah<br>  Cannabis is in all drug test because it's the most commonly used illicit drug.<br>  In my mind its a natural plant though and legalizing it would not be much different than it is now, besides hard drug use declining.|`|va3Ysr8vaa	If their not searching for it, then they won't find it.

They might not be doing these tests for drug purposes but it will still show up in the results if you've smoked it in the last 20-35 days. It varies from person to person on how long THC stays in your system.

If it is worms (like the lady said below) it WILL NOT go away, you would need medicine to kill the worms. Once u have medicine you should be fine|`|JqnMqajNaa	so i so know the answer, i take microbiology and learned so much about this, its tapeworm most likely. u get it from eating uncooked meat. the little worms are segments from the big tapeworm in your body. the tapeworm wont go away until u take one little pill and then it leaves your body. the worm is connected onto the wall of ur intestine and is eating the food u eat, it isnt dangerous to have this worm in your body, just annoying. a lot of ppl eat them on purpose to lose weight. but just go to your doctor and you just have to take one pill and it will make the worm let go of you and will be release with your waste. depending on how long u have it the bigger the worm will be. i saw this video in class and this guy had the worm in him for 3 weeks i think and the worm was 5 feet long. not to scare u but just saying..

These are the two major storing places for fat in your body and are actually a representation of your overall body fat.<br>  <br>  The key to losing this body fat is through a total body workout routine and cardio interval training.  Though it may sound odd, building muscle in your arms, chest, back, and legs is the best way to burn fat in your body (and thus your butt and belly).  Even if you don't want to gain weight or "bulk up," weight training is the best way to cut this weight off!<br>  <br>  For more information, you can visit my blog below :)  Good luck!
AA10478980	There are many sensible things you can do that will make a tremendous difference over the long term if you need to lose weight. It can be done in a healthy way. This is what has worked for me.<br>  <br>  Keeping a food journal really does help. It will give you a much better sense of how much you are eating, and when, and why.<br>  <br>  Make a few additional small changes - walk everywhere, always use stairs instead of elevators, walk on escalators, get up and move around at least once an hour if your work or your life in general is sedentary, walk every day, use a pedometer. Walking 10,000 steps a day is a really good idea. Build up to a long brisk walk everyday, or most days. Be more active and watch less TV and spend less time on the computer. Buy one piece of exercise equipment to have at home and be strict with yourself about using it. Sometimes you can find mini-steppers or exercise bikes at second hand stores and thrift stores for just a few dollars.<br>  <br>  Start a weight lifting routine.  Join a gym. Possibly you can find one that has someone who specializes in weight lifting programs for beginners. Weight lifting will increase your metabolism as well as improve posture and appearance overall. Even if you can't get to the gym you can work out at home using things around the house.  Invest in a good weight training book.  The Dummies series actually has a good one.   <br>  <br>  In terms of diet, cut out or reduce things like junk food, pop, fat, fast food. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish. Particularly if you choose a vegetarian lifestyle include natural peanut butter, hummus, dried fruit and nuts. Pay close attention to getting the nutrients your body needs to be healthy. <br>  <br>  Make your portion sizes smaller. Use a smaller plate - in our society we have become accustomed to thinking that we need a large plate of food at every meal, and we don't. About quarter of your plate of food should be protein and at least half of it should be veggies. <br>  <br>  Learn to count calories. At your current weight and activity level, you may possibly need about 2000 calories or more to maintain your current weight. So you will lose weight at a reasonable and healthy rate if you cut back to about 1600 or 1700 calories a day. <br>  <br>  Eat small amounts frequently, rather than three large meals. Never skip breakfast. Include some protein in your breakfast. It will help get you through the day.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water, at least 8 big glasses of water a day, and more if it is very hot, if you sweat a lot, or if you are exercising intensely, and eliminate fruit juices. Fruit juices have too many calories, so get your vitamins from fresh fruit, not the juice. You will begin to see changes in your body. <br>  <br>  Check out websites about nutrition, exercise, weight training, etc. Here are a few helpful links.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutrawatch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutrawatch.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.caloriesperhour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriesperhour.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_eating_diet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_ea...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-Healthy-Way" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-the-H...</a><br>  <a href="http://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a/aa011503a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weightloss.about.com/cs/fitness/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/no-weight-workout?page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/fe...</a>
E64juLwJaa	He is talking about massaging your prostate:the male g-spot.<br>  But there will not come fluids out of the anus:he is nuts.<br>  And to achieve this you need a dildo and do a hand job as well.<br>  Colors|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Stick a towel up your butt....Right before you blow,pull it out quickly.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	He is certainly joking about fluids coming out of the anus , and if that is happening to him he has a serious medical issue . Some guys do push a finger up there whilst masturbating as they find it increases the sensation . I would suggest that you do not stick anything else up there as it can lead to injury|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Not true at all. However, there is anal masturbation meaning inserting something there - a finger or dildo - as well as prostate massage, but obviously, not the penis. Although you could jerk and do anal at the same time if you wanted.|`|XgO9HUm9aa	No this is not true.<br>  <br>  You can stimulate your prostate gland which feels good when you ejaculate. usually people stick a ********* in there to do this.|`|cnk6hHQjaa	Ewww. Just do it normally man|`|qJsfBCYEaa	The prostate is an organ that is about 2-3 inches inside your anus. If you apply pressure (finger, toy, etc.) it supposedly produces great pleasure. IM with more questions.|`|rgXUsbKeaa	if you do that it means your gay cause that is how gay guys  get screwed just do this put lotion on your erect penis and rub it or hump a pillow until u ***|`|nZuOG40baa	Prostate massage.

25e0c280da6dad2a9e01aa347df1e70aaa	First of all kudos to you for wanting to keep your baby intact. First I have to say that "Mamma" has it all wrong intact men DO NOT have problems with cleanliness, infection or STD's. I know this for a FACT because my husband is uncirc'ed and has NEVER had an infection, STD or an issue with cleanliness. That's just a weak argument that pro circumcision people use. <br>  <br>  My views are that the penis belongs to the child, so he should be the one to decide if he wants the procedure done or not. I will not be having any of my sons circumcised, but if they come to me in their teens and ask for it, we'll let his opinion be heard, explain the procedure, and give him all the info he needs. If then wants to proceed with the circumcision my husband and I will allow it because it's his body and his choice. <br>  <br>  If you do decide on having the procedure done. Please make sure that he's anethecized and please do it out of love...not because you want him to have a "better looking penis." (I hear so many people on YA use that excuse and it makes me want to vomit.) And if your husband really wants to have it done, present him with the info for both sides. Maybe if he sees it from another perspective he won't want it.|`|oY9wTOdUaa	OMG... sweetheart its good to think for yourself and all but i would listen to my husband on this one. keep in mind that non-circumcised children have problems with cleaning and infections...not to mention that if he wants it done later it will be allot more pain full, and not allot of girls will like that later on in his life...|`|Wy9H5Fgraa	They say you can develope infections if you choose not to circumcise.<br>  Due to the excess skin.|`|p3NsXo0baa	BULLSHIT!! Unless your a crappy mum and dont wash your son then he wont get infections. Go on youtube and watch a circumcision videoa and tell me what you think ok.<br>  It is cruel and not human in my eyes. Why fix whats not broken? Unless there is a medical problem i wouldnt do it.<br>  <br>  What sort of parent can sit there and listen to there baby scream while there skin ( theat is attached to nerves) is being cut off? Ones with no heart. All because " i want him to look like his dad or i dont want to wash him" well grow up, its part of being a mum.
5V5L9DoBaa	It's a diuretic.<br>  It makes your DCT less permeable to water in the nephrons of the kidneys which means less water is reabsorbed into the blood. Usually water goes into the kidneys and goes back out but then coffee basically stops it from coming back out and so all the water then goes to your bladder and makes you wee wee.<br>  Alcohol has the same effect, if you've noticed you pee more and pee clearer when drinking alcohol.|`|gmH1MPn1aa	Caffeine is a diuretic so it can make you urinate more. Plus it also inhibits an enzyme that is thought to regulate mucosal secretions in your small intestine. Secretions go up, so fluid in your bowel goes up, and if the amount of fluid in your colon is greater than the amount of fluid you can reabsorb, splat, you get diarrhea, or at least looser stools, a lot of them.|`|WLlPQtuSaa	It's a liquid, and it dosn't have many nutrients so, your body dosn't need anything in coffe, thus, you pee it out.|`|RsrYLxw7aa	yes. it is a liquid and those make you have to go pee.<br>  just make sure your over a toilett first[;|`|a5MzSF5qaa	Caffeine is a diuretic it drives water out of your system.|`|wKUst6Xyaa	Coffee is a diuretic.|`|TsQumtCLaa	i think all drinks will make you pee|`|AA10652636	cuz it has caffeine|`|HmpNmEtSaa	To all saying it's because of it's diuretic properties this isn't true. Caffeine is only a moderate diuretic. It's nor more of a diuretic than water is. Meaning it's not going to attribute to frequent urination anymore than water will just because it's seen as a diuretic|`|PgtGNsPWaa	Cause ur probabally drinking to much of it <br>  lol<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiTIyxtR4zuA4itJMJxqKZ_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307142939AAo1UBq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|bHdsvFqQaa	Coffee is a diuretic.|`|QstEk6PZaa	Diuretic|`|EoCadP7kaa	drinking coffee doesnt make you piss. water does.|`|HIO0yvK0aa	i duno it always makes me need to pee to|`|fR9KdYPpaa	is this a serious question? lol|`|C0aMI33Naa	um, drinking any kind of liquids will make you pee eventually.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Are you drinking too much?

PpKJIT0aaa	Generally, you have an erection. You put a hand around your penis and start to stroke up and down. You should find you get nice/tickly type of feeling going on in your body, which gradually builds up to a bigger feeling. At that point, you may find yourself going faster, and breathing quickly, as you near an orgasm. When that happens, you will ejaculate if you have reached that stage, or just have a 'dry' orgasm (nothing comes out of your penis). You may also have 'waves of energy' through your body, but maybe not. There's no right or wrong; whatever you feel is fine for you. Your penis will also get very sensitive as well, so you might like to put some spit on it; or lube.<br>  <br>  Happy jacking! It's a great feeling and loads of fun.|`|iRlm3mOuaa	Your penis gets erect and it ejaculates this creamy white fluid, otherwise known as semen, and it feels so it could it sometimes hurts|`|vHC4k9sWaa	its the best feeling in the world dont be scared.<br>  u rub rub rub<br>  orgasm(sexual feeling-preferably moan loud)<br>  ejaculate<br>  this is what happens<br>  do it with your male friends first|`|Z4OeKTToaa	everything that you  need to know is on this site and if you wanna chat more msg me hey_monkey2003|`|XctJ5uCtaa	well,,, if your doing it right,,, an orgasm or two,,, or ten... lol|`|rgXUsbKeaa	how old r u?  i am 14 and i do it alot.<br>  <br>  well basically you apply lotion to your penis and rub your hand up and down it feels really good and feels even better as you keep going till you get to the climax were it feels amazing and then your penis (depending on your age) will ejackulate aka *** witch is white warm sticky stuff that comes out so whenn you do it be near a toiliot or something|`|qJsfBCYEaa	When male orgasm is reached, the penis ejaculates semen which carries the sperm necessary to fertailize an egg. It is also accompanied by a feeling of INTENSE plesure. IM with more questions at captainsparrow9191|`|E64juLwJaa	If you do it real good:semen will come out of your penis:that is called an orgasm.<br>  And it feels weird the first time but it gets better .<br>  Colors
TfbTYc2Laa	Vaseline debilitates the innate sinus cleansing mechanism which is called 'the mucociliary system'. In the long run, it causes severe sinus problems. Therefore, you'd better stop using it. <br>  <br>  Saline sprays and sinus irrigation using squeeze bottles should help. But taking the water into your body will help much more. Try increasing your water intake.<br>  <br>  Also do not forget that frequent nose bleeds may arise from some other factors. So, visit a doctor if your condition persists despite regular nasal irrigation.
XkmqZ07Daa	Use the videos on youtube.They have helped me do small weight training and new techniques to work on my stomach rather than just situps. i also bought "crunchless abs" video.It really works if you do it on a normal basis. it works all of the ab muscles.I have lost 12 inches in the waist since using it.|`|pKW7Zf4Taa	Martial arts is a good hobby to have because it encourages you to keep in shape.

ANhYfjNQaa	Devices and pills available at the market are really harmful to the body. Penis pump can make your penis bigger for a short period of time but it is not recommended.

Ball stretchers you can get at sex shops do increase the size of your scrotum. Regular masturbation has been said to stretch the size of your penis, I'm not sure though|`|aqeWwA71aa	I remember years ago I had an old doctor friend - been in the business for 40 years at that time.  he said it was SO COMMON for guys to think their Mr. Dick was too short, too small.  <br>  <br>  It seems to be the seat of a good part of guy's inferiority problems - and it's all so dumb.  Mr. Dick is whatever size he is, and he obviously gets the job done - look at all the people in the world.  <br>  <br>  Right now they have constant ads for that worthless "Enzyte" - the ads run back to back sometimes.  "Enzyte" doesn't do a thing - it isn't "proven" - it's all complete nonsense and a scientific scam.  But they're making a bundle off of it anyway.  <br>  <br>  Too bad there's not a way to harness all the male inferiority there is in the world and use the energy to help the economy.|`|qJsfBCYEaa	There really isn't anything that can make you bigger. Sorry.|`|GKFv4G2uaa	Depends on your age.

Relax and enjoy these new experiences with new people.|`|tsdLrJORaa	Ugh. Since the vagina shrinks back up to about the thickness of one finger, it really doesn't matter if you're more "average" than someone else. You will feel essentially the same so long as you're not particularly small.|`|fc6bFYHvaa	Just chop your penis off already.|`|AA10363258	I think that you are making this into a bigger deal than it is.
sQu3LLqtaa	Extra vitamin C will help to strengthen your immune system.<br>  <br>  The Vitamin C Foundation actually recommends 3 gm (3,000 mg ) per day but most health authorities recommend a lot less.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	most likely, they're not "colds".  wash your hands well and see your doctor.|`|qwsbej9paa	probly coz u dont eat meat<br>  <br>  when u dont have enough iron in ur diet, ur immune system breaks down.<br>  <br>  since u dont eat meat, there r beans u can eat that r high in iron and u can drink orange juice with it, coz vitamin C helps absorb iron.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope this helps and u dont get any more colds girlie.<br>  <br>  cya. :)|`|PgDR15hsaa	Taking vitamin C daily will prevent you from getting colds.<br>  Eat healthy, nutritious food, or if it's serious than you should visit a doctor.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Try taking a mulitivitamin and then a vitamin C in the afternoon.

uCDRgnmUaa	Take more insulin and drinks lots of water to flush your system. Also, if you have any more questions about Type 1 Diabetes, you should join Juvenation at www.juvenation.org (Networking site for Type 1 Diabetics!!). It has helped me a lot, especially during hard times and tough situations.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! <br>  <br>  Anna<br>  <br>  P.S. -My username is: Anna Marie<br>  <br>  Hope to see you on Juvenation!!|`|18ycbEbRaa	Give your self like 4-6 units of insulin and then check again. Then if it still high through away your current insulin and get a fresh one...take another shot and then check again if its still high change your blood sugar checking thing. Then you should be fine...if its low then have a can of pop and if your blood sugar is high whatever you do DON'T EAT ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!|`|pTjEof56aa	Give yourself more insulin then normal and test in a little bit.Then,make sure the insulin isnt old,and make sure the needles are actually giving you insulin.Shoot some insulin into the air to make sure its coming out.You should run around and drink alot of water also to help.|`|6etaFOnhaa	drink water it will help alot<br>  <br>  look for nick jonas for inspiration. even if you hate his singing, he is a really good person. please never say you hate him, because he is what gets many diabetics through a tough day.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	you don't usually have to take shots?  if you don't need insulin then you are not a type 1 diabetic.  if you really are a type 1, then you should know already how to utilize your insulin properly.  i think you need more education from your cde or nurse.<br>  <br>  also, since you're 16 and based on your other questions, just had a stillborn baby (or a miscarriage since you can't decide) and are breastfeeding your sister-in-law's baby all while being engaged to someone and attending high school, it's probably a good idea to keep a closer eye on your supposed diabetes.|`|8bQkJ2Zjaa	First of all, if you are a type one diabetic, you should be (if not have to be) on some kind of insulin. Apparently, like the one above me said, if you are 16, having a stillborn, breast feeding ANOTHER child, then you need some kind of counseling. This is NOT healthy for you, unless you are asking questions for someone else, I would go to a doctor Monday, or asap. Do as everyone said out there, and, since you might need some help with your condition(s), DO NOT EAT if your sugar is over 200. You need to test it to make sure that you are eating and taking your insulin. If you aren't on insulin, what is going on with you? You need to make sure your sugars are under control. You health is the most important here. I have had diabetes for 15 years, and because I didn't care for myself as well as I should have been when I was younger, I now have neuropathy and rentinopathy and I am only 21.  And having a child with type 1 diabetes is extraordinary dangerous if you are not caring for yourself. You need to talk to a doctor. Now.
AA10363258	no that isn't what's important.|`|yG0XF83waa	Well I know I have trouble with acne, so if I guy has acne I'm totally ok with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unless your face is all read and there are a million bumps. Like if you have SEVERE acne. But most people don't have that..|`|HLzegoKNaa	I have acne too.<br>  <br>  It really doesn't bother me at all.<br>  But I suffer from the same worries.<br>  <br>  Some people are repulsed by it, I used to get so upset because I felt like my skin scared all the guys away haha.<br>  I am 15 going on 16 and have only had 1 boyfriend, and it was FOREVER ago, like a stupid 8th grade crush boyfriend. Anywyas, yeah I always feel so self concious but I recently taught myself not to care. I don't need a boyfriend, I am comfortable being by myself.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I crush on guys for their personality.<br>  Does acne on girls bother you?|`|0qtgH7lNaa	no, it doesn't bother me. it bothers me if a guy doesn't try to take care of it if it's really severe.
0RGt9r2aaa	you cant spot lose so dont even bother with that questions but a good way to burn fat is to make a plan that interchanges the running and rowing so that your body keeps gussing on what your going to be doing <br>  like is your working out 4 days a week do 2 days of running and 2 days oof rowing it gives you chance to keep your body guessing and to work different muscles on different days|`|gfmTgLDKaa	To lose layers of fat in your stomach, you must run a lot to burn the fat, and then do lots of crunches, planks, and all the good ab workouts.|`|ofnbSlATaa	Try rowing steadily for half an hour then running for half an hour. <br>  <br>  Rowing and running are particular favourites of mine, and i find steady exercise over sprinting much more effective.
9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	If you have bumped yourself, the pain may be due to a rib fracture.  There is very little that can be done about this other than pain relief and deep breathing exercises to help prevent a chest infection.<br>  If you have had no injury, the pain may be due to something called 'chostro-condritis' which is an inflammation of the cartilege where the ribs attach.  The best relief for this would be anti-inflammatory pain relief.<br>  The other causes (much less likely because of your symptoms) would include pleurisy (inflammation of the pleura lining the inside of the chest) or  chest infection.|`|lV2a22gzaa	Question whether you had a fall, reached high or stumbled. You could have cracked a rib, which sounds like your symptoms. Rest and a good pain killer will do you good. No ease after a couple of days spells a trip to your medic to get checked out. Take it easy from now.
BRDqfAy3aa	see below - everything about missed periods and irregular periods
Tk4C0kh8aa	Well, I myself have asthma and I can tell you some of the symptoms that you might experience if you have it.<br>  - Shortness of breath, sometimes out of nowhere or when exercising and when you are scared or anxious<br>  - Pain in your chest sometimes in random moments (this is a sign that you need your inhaler and need to see a school nurse, if in school)<br>  - Chest congestion, when your chest has a slight bit of fluid or something when listened to by a stethoscope. It usually feels as if you have mucus in your chest<br>  - Wheezing is when you have to use extra force to get carbon dioxide out of your lungs. I do this right before an asthma attack. It sounds as if you are blowing air out of a slightly blocked straw. <br>  - Chest tightness is also something you should get used to if you have asthma. I have it 24/7. I can't get a deep breath at all and if you have it, you should see how much lung capacity you have by getting a peak flow test.<br>  <br>  If you have any of these symptoms, you should see your General Practioner about getting an inhaler and an asthma controlling medication.
WAkUBPORaa	dont worry i feel like that too you can be my friend :) think of positive things and things u like BE HAPPY! BE MY FRIEND! :)|`|0qtgH7lNaa	you're probably not as ugly and repulsive as you say you are. you need a new attitude though. maybe if you weren't always silent, as you say you are, you'd have some friends. maybe you do need therapy, not to be rude. it could help you.|`|dCIi9qf5aa	Kelsoe think of what you are saying. You can't die just because even your mom makes fun of how you look.Yes you are supposed to be nutured by your mom and family,but as you know the world isnt perfect. Now ugly is as ugly does. Are you a rapist? Do you burn small animals? No. Here's what God says about you and everyone. " You are fearfully and wonderfully created". So if God thinks your wonderful you and the rest of the world are not smarter than the one who created you.Oh and by the way God loves you and so do I. So don<br>  t go on the no one loves me trip. Believe me Ive been there and its just totally useless. I got an anchor when I found out that yes someone does love me, meaning God. It changed my whole world. Now no matter what happens to me,no matter who's yelling in my face, or trying to verbally abuse me, they can't cause I know that God loves me.Its really a quite strong revelation. Purple skin. What are we talking about a birth mark? A boy I know has a blueberry(dark skinned) on him, and another boy I know has a strawberry on him (light skinned). Take a half of cut lemon,squeeze the juice in your face bowl,add 7 cups of water (preferably warm) to the lemon juice and either soak the area or pour the lemon water over it for 15 to 20 minutes. see if that changes the color of the area. If not ask a doctor if or how you can change the area. After the 20 minutes let water out and rinse skin with clean water.  Then wash with Dove and rinse well. You can do this again after 3 days to lighten the area as light as you want.  Lets get back to you loving yourself. You have got to take stock in the beautiful wonderful person you are. What's good about you? write it down,practice it in the mirror, I am good and to be loved because 1. God loves me. 2. Im a nice person. 3 I can -------- 4.I am friendly 5. I wish no one harm etc. Once you convince yourself that you have the right to be loved. Then you have to love yourself first. and then others can love you. Once you let the beauty out of your self others will see it and you will be approachable. Ive been there never talking because Im afraid to be rejected. Its a waste. Be who you are. Just bust out of the thoughts that want to hold you captive and make you not live. If you are scared to talk to someone. Do the exact opposite of those evil ridiculous thoughts.They are not yours anyway. Why would you think things to hold yourself back or captive? You wouldnt.Do what you want. Practice who you are aloud and in the mirror. Recite the good and the true. If you feel scared,do the opposite. In other words Live!. Make mistakes, apologize, be clumsy, apologize, state what your real intentions were. If you are a man, let me tell you something about the world, the way the world was made, a man no matter how he looks is going to find someone to love him and be his wife. Thats just how woman were made, to desire a husband, there is nothing they can do about that. If you would read the bible you would know all these things. If you are a girl, theres make-up etc. and all kinds of things that can be done. Look at Micheal Jackson, he used to be African American, now what does he look like(bad surgeries aside). So love yourself first, go out there and make mistakes interacting with people and fine tune how you handle yourself and other people. I love you.|`|QuLrlSvhaa	Just try to ignore people who say that. I think ugly or not is not that important, important is what inside you <whether your kind or not>.<br>  Don't worry you'll find the right person for you that will look what inside you not the outside look.<br>  Just think that your not ugly <god who created us and he didn't create anyone that is ugly>..be confident to yourself..don't listen what people say bad things about you, listen to people who say good things about you. <br>  I just want to say, your mum is so rude, she shouldn't do that to you, she's your mum, she suppose to give an advised or help you to your problem.

Don't worry about it, almost all girls get them! <br>  Try applying cocoa butter on the stretch marks every day|`|JghXh9dQaa	unfortunatly stretch marks never go even using bio oil or other types iv got alot of stretch marks mine are from having 3 kids, i used every kind of lotion & potion while pregnant & after, they make no difference it depends more on your skin type ( how stretchy it is ), the good thing is the marks on your boobs will fade with time but will never completly dissapear they are the same as a scar. its quite normal for growing girls & even boys so dont worry|`|0OB7yAFwaa	If you are eating a lot and then not eating so much your boobs will grow and shrink, therefore the elasticity in your skin is stressing out.

5V5L9DoBaa	Mate.<br>  To be honest.<br>  As long as it's 95%(they usually have EFA's and a bit of carbs to help you out too) protein go for the one which is cheapest.<br>  Most of these brands make up fads which arent true.<br>  Glutamine is the biggest scam on the market. The most abundant amino acid in your body is glutamine. Further more the whey protein already contains alot of glutamine so "having" glutamine is just something thats advertised to make you buy.<br>  <br>  Also a warning about maximuscle.<br>  People say they see tremendous gains with it. And on the progain extreme it says you will gain around 3-5 lbs a week just by drinking it.<br>  However this is not muscle. It is water. It contains creatine like all the other maximuscle products (cyclone etc) and the gains you see are water retension caused by the creatine saturation in your muscles. Once you stop taking them you will see yourself deflate and as well see your money down the drain.<br>  <br>  Personally I like nutrisport as it doesn't contain any rubbish, and when I used it is when I gained the leanest muscle, hardly any fat (what i did gain was due to diet).<br>  Remember to use supplements as SUPPLEMENTS to a healthy balanced diet, with a higher protein intake than usual.|`|XkmqZ07Daa	I like the chocolate flavor.I heat it up in the mircowave and it's like "hot chocolate".Not sure if the flavor is bad for me, but I honestly don't care because I eat healthy most of the time.|`|GL920Xv5aa	Optimum Nutrition 100% whey|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	Vanilla.|`|81ff98a2b59a7150ffd94a3f4604b9e1aa	Try Goatein.  I think you can get it thru Mercola.com.  Goat dairy products are more digestible than dairy products from cows.  This one, because it is processed at a much lower temperature than most commercial whey powders, will be more bioavailable to your body for building muscle. A lot of protein powders with whey may also have soy isolates - might be good to steer clear of these, although they seem to give good results in the beginning.  Soy contains a substance that interferes with digestion, not a good thing over the long haul. It is also implicated in thyroid disorders. <br>  <br>  Raw, never -frozen animal foods are great body builders.  If you like sushi or sashimi, that's another great food to add. And take an anti-parasite pill with it if you are afraid of parasites (you have to freeze it for about 2 weeks to kill parasites, according to the USDA and other foodies).  Or try steak tartare, or ceviche (the fish is raw but soaked in lime juice that kills the bugs).  Raw meat is highly bioavailable to the body.  Cooked meat is only about 20% bioavailable.  Research it more by googling "primal diet" and "RAF."  There is a book out called "We Want to Live" and another called "The Recipe for Living Without Disease" on the internet that detail this eating style and benefits, and some amazing stories about it.  Vonderplanitz, the guy that wrote it, says that he maintains really good muscle tone without much exercise at all because the raw animal foods help him continually rebuild healthy muscle tissue.  Anyway, you can preview some of the chapters for FREE at another site, one of Karl Loren's pages, see link below...<br>  <br>  I've seen a pretty awesome body builder who uses green juices - has the same amount of protein-per-calorie as meat, very bioavailable, and helps your poop not smell so bad, lol.  <br>  <br>  Rebounding is an incredible all-over muscle-builder and toner.  Check out Dave Hall's video on what he calls "Cellercising" - he gets that body and strength from just 10 minutes a day on the rebounder.  It's on You Tube.|`|6xCyC9HSaa	i liked cyto gainer and it worked for me i gained about 5 lbs in a bit over a month taking it after i worked out. This however does have a bit of other stuff such as creatine and some glutamate, but not crazy amounts.

Tk4C0kh8aa	Well, I myself have asthma and I can tell you some of the symptoms that you might experience if you have it.<br>  - Shortness of breath, sometimes out of nowhere or when exercising and when you are scared or anxious<br>  - Pain in your chest sometimes in random moments (this is a sign that you need your inhaler and need to see a school nurse, if in school)<br>  - Chest congestion, when your chest has a slight bit of fluid or something when listened to by a stethoscope. It usually feels as if you have mucus in your chest<br>  - Wheezing is when you have to use extra force to get carbon dioxide out of your lungs. I do this right before an asthma attack. It sounds as if you are blowing air out of a slightly blocked straw. <br>  - Chest tightness is also something you should get used to if you have asthma. I have it 24/7. I can't get a deep breath at all and if you have it, you should see how much lung capacity you have by getting a peak flow test.<br>  <br>  If you have any of these symptoms, you should see your General Practioner about getting an inhaler and an asthma controlling medication.

Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .
OgcdoEDvaa	I wondered the same thing, but...<br>  <br>  when I recently ordered it online I paid $3.97 for a sample bottle and no where on the website did it say that in 21 days I was going to be charged $80 for what they sent. And when they automatically billed my credit card I was upset because there was no disclaimer and to get my refund I had to pay an extra $6 to return the product. So, after all this I never had the chance to try it... My bank (BofA) said that this is a common scam and that their fraud department is trying to help people with this problem because Acai Berry suppliers end up billing your cc monthly but then never send the product after the first time. Thankfully the bank refunded my money immediately. <br>  <br>  As far as diets go, I have had great success with drinking at least 8 bottles of water a day and power walking for 45 minutes. I lost at least 30 pounds from basically detoxing with the water and then burning the calories off with walking. Counting calories can work well and for serious dieter's it's best to keep your daily intake to 1200 at the max. Models that want dramatic weight loss will do 500 calories a day... but when you are working out I feel it's ok to eat more to keep your energy up. Steamed veggies, fresh fruit and light protein with a few carbs mixed in is best.|`|irAYgP7xaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically.

5V5L9DoBaa	Hmm tough one. Are your abs built? muscular??<br>  Because you need to have the muscles there to show in the first place, and to build them you will actually have to  eat more than you burn.<br>  It is doable but you need to do the following things:<br>  Cut out ALL junk food; pizzas, chips, ice cream, anything manufactured or oily. for 3 weeks, do hiit sprints (look them up they're good) twice a week, and 3 times a week (with a day rest inbetween) don't do situps but do stuff like abdominal crunches and leg raises and stuff. Do the bicycle and stuff. Really cut down on carbs and fats, and only eat complex carbs (no white bread, no pasta, no sweets, sugary drinks; even milk cut out or limit to breakfast only).<br>  Get yourself a PROTEIN drink, with nothing else in it, apart from EFA's and at most 5% carbs for the insulin spike for rapid absorpotion. Get also some creatine and get on that ****.<br>  <br>  After these 3 weeks, now you should be doing HIIT sprints 2-3 times a week, with the inbetween days doing circuit training (lifting light weights but at high rep ranges, while doing cardio at the same time).<br>  <br>  Also do swimming 2-3 times a week and not mess about swimming. Do as many laps as you can in 40 mins, this will help build and define your abs as well as the whole body while burning fat.<br>  After each session and before you sleep drink the protein drink and in 3 months you WILL see results. But you have to keep your diet in check, eating as little fat as you can (10% of all you eat in a day should be healthy fats - from youghurts, cottage cheese, flaxseed, fish and virgin olive oil). Don't cut out carbs but eat only complex carbs like brown bread, brown rice etc, and drink plenty of water (not too much because you will "flush out" nutrients), and eat 5 fruit and veg a day atleast. Eat alot of fiber and protein each meal to satisfy you till your next meal.<br>  Eat 6-8 small meals a day, but keep them small and eat every 2-3 hours this will increase your metabolism, keep your body in an anabolic state (build muscle/burn fat) throughout and also take the protein drink before bed to keep you from burning muscle.<br>  <br>  After 3 months if you follow this plan exactly, no cheating, not even 1 ice cream, you will have a 6 months for sure.|`|B7fS9hWOaa	Yes it's enough time, BUT your diet has to be phenomenal. No Pizzas, fast food, none of that junk, except maybe once a week.<br>  <br>  Do you know what your body fat is?

AG9msdUDaa	It sounds like it could be an infection, but if you don't feel to terribly bad in general, you could put off seeing a doctor because they will just give you antibiotics without testing the mucus to see if you actually need it, which they will soon be required to because of the tremendous issue caused by misuse of antibiotics. I digress. So there are some things you can do to boost your natural defenses. Take a vitamin D supplement every day, your immune system cannot function without it and most people are low on this because they stay out of the sun, or it is winter and the right wavelength of sun is not available and they do not eat enough fish. Take mega doses of vitamin C as your immune system uses this to make the soldiers that kill the invaders, so the more you ingest, the more you can fight. Do a little research online however to find how much you can absorb at one time and then space out your doses accordingly. Take zinc lozenges, mostly they also come with echinacea in them, and both boost immune function. Finally, you can use either oregano oil or raw garlic in your food or by themselves to kill anything bad, like bacteria, viruses, fungi, worms etc.|`|dX4Dll0yaa	Yes!|`|wVfzd7pXaa	it's probably a respiratory infection, no big deal. just go to your doctor and have it checked out so they can prescribe antibiotics:)|`|db8T2vsEaa	Bronchitis, go the doctors, get antibiotics and stay away from smoke x|`|AA10477755	sounds like you may have a "bronchitis"- most doctors would prescribe antibiotics for it|`|2Y9pejG6aa	Yes, I would.

You don't have to throw up to have food poisoning. It is usually difficult to tell the difference between food poisoning and the stomach flu.

KeevlZnTaa	Have you tried combing them out and following their natural cycle? When I worked at a daycare a few years back everyone got head lice(kids and teachers included). I tried all the shampoos, etc and nothing worked, then I stumbled across a website that detailed how to get rid of lice naturally by following their laying and hatching schedule. It worked for me and other people who I recommended it to.<br>  <br>  Basically you comb the lice out for a few days, then wait for eggs to hatch and comb them out. It takes a month since lice eggs hatch every 30 days, so it assumes eggs were laid the day you begin. There is a bit more to it, certain days you have to brush while you get a day off of two on other days.<br>  <br>  Here is the site that has a natural way of getting rid of lice. It also explains why it works, etc.<br>  <a href="http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/theliceprogram/theprogram.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/thelicep...</a>|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  When I got head lice at camp, they would put mayo throughout my hair and wrap my whole head in plastic wrap.<br>  <br>  The camp counselors would wait 1 hour and then wash out my hair and comb through with a metal lice comb.<br>  <br>  Work for me !|`|BTI0XOptaa	The ONLY safe way to get rid of head lice permanently is to use a totally natural alternative to the chemical shampoos then use prevention methods such as hairspray and tea tree mixed with water in a spray bottle every day to ensure they never return. <br>  <br>  Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. They are also ineffective as head lice have become immune to them.<br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|nTQghH34aa	okay when i was 4 i had it really bad so don't be freaked out.<br>  pour manoies in your hair and rap it in a plastic bag,wear it to bed and rinse it out in the morning. i'm not joking it works.<br>  it suffacates the lice|`|t4imJT9Eaa	Put mayo on your head and cover it with plastic wrap.|`|5D4T6h7waa	bleach. it might lighten there hair, but its guaranteed to make those bastards suffer!!!|`|8Al9fDXIaa	First of all you must treat the entire family. If one child has it assume the entire family is infected take it from me, i know. Second you MUST search through the children's hair 2 times a day and remove all the nits. This must be done because nits are where the lice come from. Second you must sanitize all bedding, couches , car seats clothes jackets, just about everything that is cloth that the children come in contact with, Boil your hair brushes hair ties etc, for 5 min in soapy water or buy new ones. Ok things  you can use <br>  Lysol disinfectant spray- to spray liberally on things that cannot be laundered.Like the couch the crib mattress, the car seats etc. You must be vigilant in looking for nits twice a day in the children's hair., You must treat all family members as if all are infected. You launder the bedding and blankets in hot water if not a hot dryer for at least 3o minutes. Vacuum the kids room and entire house and spray the lysol on the carpet . Also if your children are getting exposed to too much insecticide you can use a suffocate  for at least 8 hours. Vegetable oil poured liberally on the hair and then put in pony tail etc., Wash out with a good shampoo and rinse with 1 part water 1part white vinegar, This is supposed to help unglue the nits from the hair shaft. Keep looking for nits 2 times a day and eventually it will be gone, Good luck and don't give up. Vegetable oil will wash out believe it or not rather easily. This smothers the lice and is much less toxic than  Insectisides .All family members must be treated.|`|xzYpuohfaa	treat everybody, after shampooing with a shampoo killing lice you still need to check the hair and removed the eggs that is more effective. proper hygience like taking a bath everyday, have each of them their own comb to use to prevent transfer and wear caps when prolong exposure to the sun, lice likes sweaty and dirty hair.

HIPPA strictly limits what health care workers can and can't tell others, so you should be safe, especially if you ask them not to.
WMR8hVlfaa	Not anymore, but it still does happen when people abuse tampons. TSS was huge in the 70's and 80's because of certain chemicals that were being used in different tampons. That combined with prolonged use of tampons caused many women and girls to get TSS. Because of the huge outbreak, the FDA stepped in to regulate what the tampons were made of as well as make sure all tampon producers put adequate warnings on their products.|`|eff556e68b639b40e89cc7516013482faa	I believe that the government mandates that the companies put the warning in with their instructions.<br>  <br>  TSS is rare, but it can still happen, but not always from the use of tampons. Even more rare is the fact that some men have been know to contract TSS. <br>  <br>  Back in the 1980's there was a brand of tampon called Rely. Their advertising was that it was super absorbent. Statistics showed that the majority of tampon-related cases of TSS were in women who used Rely. Tests confirmed that the Rely tampons contained tiny little "balls" that looked like styrofoam, giving them their super absorbency. Rely was quickly taken off the market and the government stepped in. Since then, every brand of tampon I've ever tried has contained the warning.|`|tVUJUKWkaa	It definately happens, but its EXTREMELY rare. You shouldn't have to worry about it, just take the proper precautions.|`|b0z8t7nYaa	no only 1,000 woman a year in the us it rare|`|68o68mENaa	They make a way bigger deal than it actually is.<br>  Have you ever read the paper that comes in a tampon box?<br>  The percent that they give for girls and woman that have TSS is actually very small.<br>  <br>  But it's not that they don't want to get sued. It's mandatory that they put that there are flaws with tampons and need to put it out as a warning. It gives you the choice on weather you want to take the risk of using a tampon.|`|1cDo3REBaa	no it's very rare|`|iJtuhLMTaa	TSS is fairly uncommon.  There were only 6 cases in 1997 linked to menstruation which is the most recent year I saw numbers for when doing a quick search.  <br>  <br>  The number was much higher in the early 80's and that was linked to a super high absorbency tampon with an abnormal chemical composition.  That type of tampon is no longer on the market|`|BRDqfAy3aa	everything about TSS - see below
AieTV6q0aa	been there...that's what you call the twenties-syndrome...just continue to drift along, and please give yourself a break, you are torturing yourself...you need to reset your mentality about we-are-all-going-to-die-anyway thing...that is so true, that is why there's no point in being hopeless...you may find the book of Rick Warren PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE very helpful..borrow from a friend...it's just one book anyway...i strongly suggect you read it...|`|1Qxe2Sjhaa	Your question may seem complicated and extensive but the answer is one word...GOD. When you find Him and learn about who he is and how much He loves you, you will know what all is necessary for a healthy life. A great way to look into learning about this is to get a "truth quest" bible. It isn't a bunch of thee's and thou's and it doesn't just preach it to you. You can say that you don't believe in it and use that as an excuse to not try it but look at it this way...most people don't believe that there is hobbits and goblins and such right, yet Lord Of The Rings is the third most popular book ever sold....Guess what is number 1...THE BIBLE. Even if you think its hooey, it's a really good read...action murder mayhem romance passion...anything you want. Not to mention that by the time your finished reading it, this time in your life will be your testimony.|`|9pLI73pqaa	You need hope and a purpose. I found mine in a local fellowship of people who follow biblical teachings. God wants everyone to live happy, successful lives. Our vision statement includes Intimacy with God, Community of Believers and moving towards the kingdom of God. Find someone of Christian faith, a counselor or church leader, who can help you.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	i'm sorry to hear about your problems...i wish i could help<br>  <br>  best of luck
igdMFqW7aa	I don't know if I can really help you, I'm only 14, and don't necessarily know what exactly you want.. but I can say that I've been thinking the same kinds of thoughts for the past few years. <br>  <br>  The "what's the point, we're all just going to die" thing... I was so hopelessly confused on the subject, that I got really suicidal for a while.. but then I read this book, Battle Royale (Not really supposed to be a self-help book, haha) and there was this quote<br>  <br>  "What I mean is that, even a dumb *** like me can think everything’s pointless. Why do I get up and eat? It all ends up **** anyway. Why am I going to school and studying? Even if I happen to succeed I’m going to die anyway. You wear nice clothes, you seek respect, you make a lot of money, but what’s the point? It’s all pointless. Of course this kind of meaninglessness might suit this crappy nation. But…but, you see, we still have emotions like joy and happiness, right? They may not amount to much. But they fill our emptiness. That’s the only explanation I have"<br>  <br>  So I decided, since I'm agnostic and believe anything is possible, IF this happens to be all there is in the world then I'm going to live my life as best I can and be happy. Try to do what I enjoy and now give a **** about what anyone else thinks or does. And if there does happen to be something after this I can take it on when I get to it.<br>  <br>  And I was also seriously bothered with trying to find out who I am as a person, the way I kind of defined myself was by making a bit of a list of topics, the big philosophical kinds of things, (i.e. death, life, love, people, morals, friendship, our purpose in the world) and just spent time meditating/thinking deeply about each and trying to form my own opinions and decide what I think about them. I wrote down my main conclusions on each topic and that helped me somewhat with finding who I am. Though I don't necessarily know what your definition of who you are is, I think my opinions are what form who I am.<br>  <br>  Hope I could be helpful... Sorry it's kinda rambly :P|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	The point is that you are here..like the rest of us...and you have to make a go of it..like the rest of us. And you can do so with inner peace. Firstly. reject totally (as I do)...the definition of what is called "success" on this planet. "Success" is defined as....having loads of money...perhaps multiple properties....possessions...or being in the public eye (e.g. film & rock stars etc). Well...this is wrong. Success to me means to be.....yourself....do the things as YOU wish to do them (within the law) and within your budget...and just to live as contented as possible....What I mean is this. Say you want to travel to a location where it takes a lot of money to live well..and you cannot do this due to your financial means. well then be CONTENTED to travel INSTEAD..to your relatives in the next state by train...and spend time with them. Lower your expectations..and you will live an extremely contented life. Realise ..and most importantly accept..that you are not rich..and you cannot live like that. be happy with little things...instead of expecting big expensive things and not get them. I believe that this is the secret to contentment.
wIGh58aiaa	Idk...maybe you pullled a muscle
AA11563237	Snapple,<br>  I have been a paramedic for 9 years now and I can tell you the most painful injury known to man is a burn. A 3rd or 4th degree burn can take up to 2 months in the hospital to heal. Every day they have to scrape off dead skin cells to prevent infection (with things that are almost like steel wool). The agony and intense sensation produced from the burn would, in my opinion, be the worst pain in known. Following that I would say that the following are pretty painful: pelvic fracture, long bone fracture, kidney stone, childbirth, diverticulitis (an inflammation of the lining of the colon), cholliecystitis (gallbladder) and I suppose a global rupture (a burst of the eyeball it'self).<br>  <br>  Now on to the southland: The reason a mans testicles are so sensitive to pain is because they are filled with semen and nerves. A testicle is the organ that actually produces semen and is nothing but a round formation of very long tubelike structures that eventually venture to to the prostate. If traumatically injured (lets say a kick), think of a plastic coke bottle. Although they are hollow, they are filled with fluid. They do not allow for any expansion and thereby cause a severe increase in pressure in the testicle it'self. So no room to expand, filled with fluid, and bombarded by nerves......it is pretty much the sure fire way to make a grown man cry.|`|9087a58147211503cc7673b4ad6b1f4baa	I would have to disagree with the groins statement. The most painful thing ever is a kidney stone.
R0Zs6ifYaa	If you already eat white bread, yes you will loose weight. But you DO need some type of carbohydrate. Try Wheat or Rhye bread. These breads are GOOD for you. Avoid white bread. Straight simple carb.<br>  <br>  So yeah you would, but I wouldn't eliminate it from your diet.|`|8eCyY7RCaa	Are you talking about the low-carb diet?<br>  <br>  If so, you'd need to eliminate or reduce all carb intake.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	yes you would for sure and if you stayed away from potatoes and soda you would notice it in a week...   Good luck      Grant M|`|1Txef261aa	It depends on what else you eat instead of the bread.  If you want to loose weight just increase your cardio|`|AG9msdUDaa	Yes it absolutely does especially since the chemicals used to bleach bread are 100% linked to diabetes. And I quote "Bleached white flour: Not only have the bran and germ been stripped away, but bleached flour also contains a substance from the flour bleach (alloxan) which causes diabetes in animals. Unbleached white flour should also be avoided since it is stripped of essential nutrients.<br>  The Enzyme Cure by Lita Lee with Lisa Turner & Burton Goldberg, page 123"<br>  <br>   Also, when you remove bread from your diet you also remove a lot of sugar which will definitely help you lose weight. Finally, many people react to bread by way of inflammation in their tissues, and this is known as false fat, which is easy to lose once you stop eating bread. This is related to the gluten in the bread, which is in all bread and not just white . . .I switched to rice flour based products.<br>  <br>  And I quote: "Thanks to Dr. Fasano's research, we now understand that as many as 1 in 133 people in the US have celiac disease and the number is thought to be much higher in people with celiac relatives and in those that have the gene type(s) for celiac disease." <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/022346.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalnews.com/022346.html</a>|`|BBVfRheyaa	nope|`|tq1eQwRZaa	Its good to cut out excess carbs, but you can still eat some breads and lose weight. I eat Pepperidge Farm Light Style wheat bread occasionally b/c it has only 45 calories per slice and 9 grams carbs, plus fiber. So it really depends on what bread you eat. But too much bread is not good.
eR2rrcJcaa	I have also had black circles under my eyes but since I started using this simple technique, they have gone away almost completely: apply cool tea bags, an ice cube wrapped in soft cloth, or cucumber slices to your eyes daily. The tannin in tea bags has been shown to reduce swelling and discoloration, and cucumber slices have long been used to reduce puffiness and refresh the appearance of skin around the eyes. Lie down, preferably in the morning, and leave fresh cucumber slices or cool, damp caffeinated tea bags (you can refrigerate them overnight so they’ll be ready) over your eyes for about 10-15 minutes. Keep your eyes closed. You should see an improvement within 2 weeks of doing this :D|`|4VdBPCU1aa	One nights sleep wont do the trick, you have to get a lot of sleep like every night.

6dL7UGvfaa	You may not be 'normal' from others notion of normality, but believe me there is no standard, universal definition of normality. What was abnormal once became normal later, in course of time! Besides, each one has his/her own measure of normalcy as long as it does not affect badly on others. There are as many ways to be normal as there are people! If you are feeling a fair measure of happiness/love within you and are fairly efficient in work, just do not bother about those 'symptoms', bear and be indifferent to it! Things may sort out on its own, be watching!|`|xrAb9L7yaa	youre not crazy. i can do something like that where i cant make it tiny but i can make it go back and forth between bigger than normal and smaller that normal really fast|`|0VftAjEJaa	Awesome.

I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true.

RgEtKVaKaa	Hi Country Gal.  No one should minimize your anxiety.  As a health care professional, this angers & saddens me.  Be as assertive as you can.  Let them know that you are anxious & if they minimize your feelings, let them know what they are doing & ask them to stop.  I am giving them the benefit of the doubt, perhaps they are unaware of how they come across.  I would want to know if my patient felt belittled  or minimized.  Let's hope they do too. Do you go alone or does a family member/friend accompany you?  Having someone with you (the right person) can help ease your anxiety & help you be more assertive.  You are in a vulnerable position - having a compassionate, strong person along for the ride would be beneficial.<br>  Your feelings should be acknowledged by the medical staff & they should do EVERYTHING possible to minimize your anxiety - not minimize you.  If you feel/believe that your health care providers (HCP) sincerely care about you, that will help a great deal.  Calm, confidence goes a long way when working with anxious patients.  If you don't understand something or you don't know what to expect, ask.  I realize that time is always in short supply but, thoughtful answers can be given quickly if the HCP knows his/her business. <br>  The medication you are receiving is very scary.  There is not much I can say to alleviate your fears.  Obviously, it is the only game in town at this point.  If you didn't need it to save your bowel & your life, you certainly wouldn't take it.  <br>  Yes, surgery definitely complicates the matter - your body is still trying to heal & them you add Remicade to the mix.  This is too much for one girl to do alone.  <br>  Given what you are facing, I suggest you talk with a counselor/therapist.  I am assuming that there is someone who specializes in helping people deal with life threatening diseases & treatments at your local hospital.  Call the social services department at the hospital where you receive treatment - if they don't have someone perhaps they will make a recommendation.  People facing chemo for cancer certainly share similar fears - that would be another resource).  My purpose in suggesting a therapist is to help you with your anxiety  - fear of the medication, fear of the disease, recovering from surgery, etc. <br>  From what you have said,too much focus has been placed on your bowel - you are much more than Crohn's disease.  It is time your whole being was addressed.  If you are not strong enough at this point to ask for help, I hope you have a friend or family member who can step up to the plate.  <br>  Bless you.|`|sp89XfT4aa	I work in mental health.  When I have an anxious patient I try to not minimize any of their problems. I try to listen actively and encourage them to get better. Also to be supportive. Only give advice if they are really willing to take it.
RgEtKVaKaa	You have been through a tremendous ordeal.  Is this the only time you experience these symptoms?  Remicade is no picnic & bowel surgery is  a huge deal.  Hopefully, the new surroundings with be a distraction.  If not, talk to your doctor about this - perhaps there is something he/she can give you to help you through this time.  Obviously, you have Crohn's disease or something similar so you have been through the mill.  I wish you health.|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	It's never normal to have anxiety..

kZ6N5odXaa	Elimate all stress and relax. Try laying down in a dark room with soothing music and warm tea and see if it helps.<br>  <br>  But since you haven't slept for two days, you may have insomnia, I reccomend you should go to your doctor and get it checked out.|`|bIj65VE9aa	I am there with you!  I used to be a terrible insomniac.  Don't take prescription medication, for it addicting and you will never be able to sleep on your own.  Take Melatonin.  It is over the counter and is something naturally in your body.<br>  <br>  Know that you cannot stress about staying awake.  That will only make it worse.  Also know that as long as you are relaxing, you are "recharging you battery" so don't worry about it.  I am not saying it is a good substitute for sleep but it helps me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AZILMgnQaa	Try taking Benadryl, it has a side effect of making people very drowsy.

You're wanting to overwork and exhaust your body, and think that'll somehow build a fantastic physique? Try again. You'll be drained, sluggish, and you'll look and feel like sh*t. Your body needs rest and recovery, not a constant barrage of insanity. <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with working out daily, not as long as you aren't over training your system. Working out 6 days a week for 6 hours each day will certainly over train your system. This is not the way to see progress. Muscle mass is expensive for your body to maintain, and with all this over training, it'll be the first thing to go because your body will want to consume calories. That's right...muscle goes first, not fat. Over training puts you in a catabolic state (muscle breakdown, not build-up), and your body will consume it for calories. This leaves you weaker and flabbier. Not a good choice. <br>  <br>  I lost about 100lbs in about 10 months. I did exercise a lot, about 12-17 times per week. But it was different kinds of training. I didn't just sit there for hours at a time. I broke it up throughout the day and because of that, I saw results. I gave my muscles time to rest, and I challenged them as well.|`|tIldpr7vaa	thats waaaaaaaaay too long in the gym<br>  <br>  30-40 mins for cardio<br>  <br>  and 40-50 mins lifting weights|`|FyAHNpQbaa	yes. nobody needs to spend 6 hours a day working out. i could see if you were an athlete training for an event. but you're not. <br>  <br>  doing too much, too soon will hurt you. you'll get discouraged. try starting out with just 1 hour a day. you also need rest days for your body to recover. no recovery time=injuries.<br>  especially when weight lifting, you need to give those muscles 1-2 days rest in order to heal. do you know how muscle and endurance is built? when you work out, you're actually making small tears in the muscles you're working. in order to become stronger and for the muscles to grow, they need to heal before you work them again.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	cardio is good everyday, i'm not sure with weights though<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  take care

One must order a stool examination for ova and parasites.<br>  <br>   Usually three samples of stools (one per day) over three days are collected. An examination for all parasites will be done and not just tapeworms. A wetprep examination with the microscope is made to check for motile microscopic parasites and then the stool is concentrated by adding cleaning solutions and reconentrating it and checking for ova (eggs).<br>  <br>  Adult tapeworms often fragment segments (proglottids) off into the stool and they can be motile and wiggle in the toilet and if these are found then microscopic slides can be prepared in which the uterine branches are examined which aids in the diagnosis of identifying what kind of tapeworm it is. Eggs present in the stool can also determine the type of tapeworm. With the adult the head of the beef tapeworm is different than the pork tapeworm and also different from the fish tapeworm. One rarely obtains the entire worm for examination.|`|45qyvYU2aa	Stool cultures which check for ova and parasites.|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	a swab of your poop|`|4A1floNxaa	most likely from a stool specimen, I work in a micro lab
2RzEaod9aa	You don't need a video, weight loss program, or pill. I lost about 100lbs and it only took about 10 months...and they say it's hard for women to lose weight! Puh-lease! Here's how.<br>  <br>  DIET<br>  Eat 5-6 small meals a day made of lean protein and natural carbs. Your metabolism is like a fire. If you only feed it small twigs, it goes out. If you try to feed it one or two logs throughout the day, it goes out. But if you feed it several small logs throughout the day, it becomes a roaring fire. Don't do stupid things like 100 calorie packs, diet soda, or anything like that...and certainly stay away from fried foods, processed foods...anything unnatural, basically. You want to consume real food made with real ingredients...and that typically means you'll have to make it yourself. The key is to make a lot and freeze portions so you can have it ready to take with you throughout the week. Make a few types of meals so you don't get bored. This way, you just throw it in the microwave and you're all set. If I can eat 5-6 small meals a day that I make myself while working 3 jobs, you can do it, too :)<br>  <br>  <br>  EXERCISE<br>  You'll need a mix of cardio and strength training. If you do them back to back in one gym session, do strength training first. That way, you're starting fresh...then hit the cardio. You always want to challenge your body. I can give you more specifics on how to exercise if you email me your exact goals (tone, muscle, or bulk). <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|9pLI73pqaa	The program my doctor recommended and I follow is a good one. You will not believe how much you can eat, still lose weight, and feel good, too! Pls see my source web site.|`|peB3XgiGaa	I don't know any quick ways to lose weight, but lay off soda, junk food, and red meat. Take multivitamins and work out at least five days a week. If you eat more fresh foods like fruits and vegitables and curb cravings with protien bars or nuts, it should help. Be sure to be focused and not to lose track of your goal. If ever you have a craving for something unhealthy, just think about your goal weight.|`|tKr7sXEJaa	dude totally email me<br>  i wanna be a psychologist and fitness trainer and know all about being overweight or underweight<br>  i  used to be anorexic so i know how it feels to hate your body all that much and i think i  can help you out<br>  julianna1633@comcast.net
lV4trHW1aa	That's ok, there are different kinds of diets that people have. I'm studying nutrition and it seems like you are possibly eating mostly fruits, veggies, nuts, etc.? With that in mind, you can take omega supplements if you choose or a regular multivitamin. Normally vegitarians lack the iron/proteins that animal proteins provide. If I were you, do some research on what you could take in eating that sort of diet. For the puffy undereye situation, a simple hemmroidal cream will help reduce the puffiness. It sounds weird, but I have heard that it works. Or you could just get a regular firming eye cream. Try using a cold eye mask too.|`|y1TDricRaa	If you don't eat much protein you can take a good protein powder that is what i do cuz i never eat protein either so i know take a really good soy fermented protein powder by praire naturals. or even a good hemp or whey protein powder. if don't have a healthy diet then taking a good quality multivitamin such as new chapter or natural factors is a good idea.  But you still have to try your best to eat healthy.  Taking multivitamins and omega 3-6-9 is not a bad idea.  Although taking a 369 may be a waste of money due to the fact that your body already makes the 9 and omega 6 you can get from eating certain foods like pumpkins, hemp, olive oil but for the 3 a good source is fish oil or cod liver oil or even krill oil that you can buy from a health food store. hope this help.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	Omega 3's are fine to take with a multivitamin.  This is such a wide open question because now a days it really depends on what brand of vitamin you choose.  You body only absorbs up to about 10% of the minerals from an over the counter vitamin.  I had to research and found a company online I have a membership through and get my vitamins from them because they are known worldwide now for their 85% absorbtion.|`|eUQ8TIJPaa	Hiya<br>  <br>  People that don't eat much meat or fish tend to miss out on protein, however if you tend to eat lentils and beans this will help. However, meat and fish provide more of the other minerals and vitamins required for a healthy balanced body and some of these are the omega 3 6 and 9 oils and folic acid. if you don't eat much fish or meat then you may want to try and take a one a day supplement of these, instead of getting supplements for each of these, why not get a one a day A-Z supplement, you can try something like Centrum or a Tesco or Boots alternative which is just as good. For the puffy eyes, this is usually due to water and fluid storage near the eyes and sinus area. A good way to get rid of this is to make sure you get plenty of sleep, eat lots of fruit including fruit juices and also whilst lying down, close your eyes, get some face cream, apply onto your fingertips and rub under eyes away from the face. Do this for a couple of minutes every morning and night before bed and you will start to see results. Hope this helps and let us know how you get on, best of luck|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Thes best one to take is Omega 3 capsules and Cod liver oil capsules, it wont do you any harm not to eat fish - I never eat fish and I am very healthy
WMR8hVlfaa	Regular are smaller, of course. You shouldn't have a problem getting them in. Really, unless you have a super heavy flow or don't have time during the day to constantly change your tampons (like me), then you don't need to use super anyway.|`|AA12198724	Regular tampons hold 6-9grams of blood and super holds about 9-12 grams of blood. It is a bit bigger and may be a bit more uncomfortable so you should try to use a tampon with a plastic applicator. Playtex sport is good if you are in constant motion but if not than I recommend getting the OB tampons. They are small and although they do not applicator they come with this pro comfort cover so its not gonna absorb all the blood when you are trying to insert it and make your vagina really uncomfortable and hard to put the tampon in.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	I find a difference, the super ones are too big personally I use regular the super are for really heavy flow but if you find them too big too use the regular

Xanax is good for lowering blood pressure, but I place a lot of emphasis on exersizing. Also, try to look at the brighter side of things. There is always some dark to the good in things, but negative thinking and such will only make your exaggerated mind create irrational lies. Learn to find beauty in the nature around you and try to spend more time with family. Be more outgoing and let go of any tension or grudge that is causing the blood pressure to skyrocket. Remember - you are in control of your own choices. Make sure you have an adequate amount of sleep, and maintain a healthy sleep schedule.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|JUYjyP0xaa	To lower blood pressure you should relax, exercise, eat well, and reduse sodium.

About a week after getting new contacts, you should always follow up to make sure the fitting is correct. Many people do not do this and cancel the appointment thinking they don't need it.  This is usually the reason for contacts not feeling comfortable on the eye - ill fitting.

5Qo6OWNzaa	GNC guys are always trying to make a sale. That doesn't mean it isnt a good product. Honestly, having been a member of Getbig.com for years and reading about what real body builders have tried and reviewed I would say its all in the eyes of the beholder. Some say it does nothing, others can't believe the energy and pump they get from it.. at the end of the day, its really the hard work in the gym, the good diet, and rest that builds muscle (with a good whey protien and creatine supplement) but if YOU feel energized and feel you are getting results, then its worth it.|`|tIldpr7vaa	NO products dont work, they have been proven bunk.

5Qo6OWNzaa	HIIT or High INtensity INterval Training is the best fat burner.. You can do a search on HIIT or Guerlla Cardio but basically its warming up for 3 minutes, going all out for a minute, moderate for a minute, all out.. ect etc.. works for treadmill, running, biking, jump roping.. and its all over in 20 minutes...|`|tIldpr7vaa	any cardio is good as long as really exert yourself, 30-40 mins a day, 4-5 days a week. <br>  <br>  Also might wanna look into keto diet, it can really help for getting abs|`|y2Uks58paa	your right you do need intense cardio for better results. you could lose it on the bike, but i doubt in two weeks. in that same 2 weeks if you were to run,tredmill,or crosstrain you might have a chance. running is probably your best bet tho, it burns the most calories the quickest.

J1sOD24kaa	It depends on how much you weight now. If you are just overweight (not bigger) then it will probably be harder to lose the 15 lbs but if you are obese or above it will come off faster if you work hard and eat right.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you have seen the she "the biggest loser" but sometimes they will lose up to ten pounds in a week. That is because they are very large and they are also working out about 6 hours a day and they have the Registered Dietitian and fitness instructors. So on that show it is definitely possible but if you are doing it on your own be careful....here is something for you to think about:<br>  <br>  1 lb = 3500 calories<br>  if you can burn 500 calories a day x 7 days = 3500 calories (one pound)<br>  <br>  Here is how I would recommend you to cut the 500 calories daily....burn 250 calories with a good workout. Get your heart rate up and you will burn the calories in less time. The other 250 calories a day I would cut it out of what you are eating. Think about how much you usually eat and then try to find a way to cut back by 250 and honestly that isn't really very much.<br>  <br>  Anyway good luck I hope I helped a little bit! =)|`|uDoXxSxKaa	Of couse its possible to lose that much in two months. Trust me. Whenever I feel like I have been a little too indulgent I go on a little diet. The most I have lost in a week is about 13 pounds. Imagine what you could achieve in a month if you go at this pace. 52 pounds in a month, how does that sound. To me is sounds crazy. But i can do it and that is because I am very tolerent to pain and not eating very much. Some days I only used to eat vegetables al day long. Its crazy because I dont do anything. I dotn go to the gym, I dont exercise I just dont eat alot and go out with my friends all day long. When I reach about 6:00pm I eat a small meal the size of my palm and thats it. No breakfast, no lunch. <br>  <br>  I know it sounds extreme but I have lost of lot weight by doing it. I am 16 now and I weigh 107 pounds. When I was 15 I weighed I89 pounds. Sounds crazy doesnt it? And to think it took about 3 months to lose all that.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FSxKBbbJaa	This may sound crazy but if you take a multivitamin in the morning and drink at least 8 glasses of water a day this will help you loose the weight. Expecially if you are exercising. I would not weigh yourself so much. Just try and weigh yourself in the morning. I feel maybe there is too much concentration on your weight.

You don't get your period the first inactive pill. It always takes 2-3 sometimes even 4 days for your period to start. Plus you just started. It is completely normal.
RNtwgXhKaa	I just got all 4 of mine out too. You've been regularly taking your Vicodin, right? Cuz that helps A LOT. If he went into your jawbone I think that means you had a partial or bony impaction. You may have a reaction to your Amoxicillan or whatever antibiotics you were given. They'll figure it out when you go into the ER. GOod luck. I know the pain that comes from wisdom teeth extraction, so I totally know what you're going through.

I told the guy that if Ya were having a lottery they would do it over Ya. Anyway as soon as anyone starts talking about money you know its a scam. Msn.com featured these scams a week and a half ago.. That there were a lot of African and other country scams concerning accounts and blah blah blah. Anyway the one I read about in the feature was a son of an African official who was locked up and put all this money in an account for his son and of course he needed the person whom he wrote to to pay whatever amount of money to do something to release the money and of course it was millions and was promised thousands even though they were only asking for 50 or hundreds to help the person collect the money. This scam unfortunately is working cause someone just sent you this scam.
