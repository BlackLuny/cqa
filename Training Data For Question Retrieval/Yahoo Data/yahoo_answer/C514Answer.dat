CDbawVldaa	Well I'm not exactly sure what your definition of toned is, but I'm going to guess that by "toned" you want to look ripped or have visible abs. Well it all depends on what your diet is like. Let me explain...<br>  <br>  If you are eating to much food no matter how much you run, lift weights and exercise you are going to put on weight. Now some of that weight will be muscle which will make your muscles look bigger (maybe that's what you mean by toned?) but some of that weight will be fat too. And putting on fat is not going to make you looked "toned". <br>  <br>  Now if by "toned" you mean you want to have 6 pack abs then what you really need to do is pay careful attention to your diet (eat less) so that you will lose fat. By losing the fat that is covering your muscles it will allow you to see more definition. <br>  <br>  So YES running and lifting weights will change the appearance of your body, but how you eat will determine what the appearance of your body will look like. <br>  <br>  If you want some tips on how you can lose fat check out my blog...<br>  <a href="http://www.profatlossadvisor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.profatlossadvisor.com</a>|`|jW7Fkwhnaa	well to start off it all depends on age weight and ya. If your over 18 you can get on "legal Roids in a bottle" if not then stick to protein that should work. I've been running and working out for about 1 year now i've seen results but i'm 14 so... stick to running 1-2 miles aday dont over the cardio thats how you lose muscle mass. If you want to lose weight in an area do low weight lots of reps. if the opposite then high weight and low reps. You could also try a prymid. low to high then to max then back down. just keep working out and you'll get there. every pound of muscle means your body has to burn 50 extra calories to maintain it just doing nothing so look into that. good luck|`|qI9k9lJVaa	the guy above me is correct. i think you know the answer. <br>  OF COURSE!!!! espacially running.|`|Q5eUUbB4aa	WHAT DO YOU THINK?! Do you need a forum full of yes's which you know you'll get to justify exercising?  I dont understand ppl like you, you know the answer but you need ppl to say it anyways....|`|jVosSk1taa	It will depend on your age and gender. But, I would suggest you eat 1 hr before you workout (40% carbs, 20% fat, and 40% protein) and eat pure protein after you workout. Have any questions email jessicamanganaro@yahoo
Oq5a5hRhaa	I get really uncomfortable, and think something along the lines of, "What am I supposed to do now?"<br>  <br>  And it really depends on who says it, too. A man twenty or thirty years older than me who I've never seen before in my life really upsets me. Men closer to my age that I would never date, it upsets me less. Men who I'm attracted to, I'm just plain embarrassed.<br>  <br>  But if you're like me, it seems to be the total creeps who you would obviously never consider (because they're way older, have just told you they're unemployed, or don't know what hygiene is) who make these comments.|`|bxji3S56aa	well...i'd say its a bit weird.<br>  <br>  i don't know hwo you dress so im not accusing you.<br>  <br>  but if you dress like a hoe (revealing) then expect that kind of attention.<br>  <br>  But if a guy just flatters you like, just smile n say thank yu.|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	nope, not weird at all cause you just might feel like your a piece of meat to them if oyu get it too often.. or more likely the way they say it|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	I think you're a lesbian|`|TIsgCnhkaa	Guys minds work different than womens, and this type of flattery is just the way they express that they like you and face it, guys are materialistic and are attracted by curves. Take it how you want, but its probably just a guy trying his best, don't blame him for his lack of game.|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Depends on the compliment,,if he says your body looks great, thats good , but if he says I love your **** or ***, than he has no respect and is just a jerk..It has to be a kind compliment and subtle, and respectful.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	I would think it depends on just exactly are they saying, like hey you have pretty hair, great eyes, beautiful face. Or are they saying WOW great boobs?? Or that old saying Wow you must be jelly because jam can't shake like that.|`|zMkQvxLraa	for me it depends who it is and how they do it. if it's a random guy on the street i'll flip them off. if it's my boyfriend i'll be flattered.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Its not weird. Its just the way you feel|`|RyEArGx9aa	everyone thinks differently..|`|8FiJ5i81aa	well women are objects|`|kTZevQNHaa	That's a little  on the strange side.<br>  You need to learn how to accept a compliment.<br>  <br>  I suspect you are just an extremely  modest woman who is a lot more than identifying as just her body--but spirit, mind and soul...and thus--the offence you take.<br>  <br>  From your picture here, I myself will tell you  that you are a very attractive women.<br>  <br>  Come on--you must care if or if not he likes your body, no?<br>  Your physique is part of who you are and he's not intentionally "objectifying" you.<br>  (That's just how you are perceiving it.)<br>  <br>  He's complimenting that hot body you've tried so hard to maintain,<br>  <br>  You wear makeup I presume and nice outfits?<br>  <br>  I don't imagine YOU think you're objectifying your own body--even though you're making a concerted effort to embellish it to look nice so don't be so quick to be offended when your lovely man takes notice.<br>  <br>  It's better than him *never* complimenting you...some women have a man who won't ever bother to say a nice compliment.<br>  We all need and want reassurance and approval / praise from our sexual partners, don't you agree?<br>  <br>  Now, to play the Devil's advocate, if he slaps you on the as$ everytime you walk by and says ,"Nice tight looking butt", then I'd say you've got a point but you didn't specify he is doing that...<br>  <br>  If he's complimenting you as you are making love or undressing in front of him...then that is totally acceptable.<br>  <br>  Just maybe tell him you're flattered but you'd like also to hear some feedback about your value as a human  being...your personality and other merits. I'm sure he'll happily oblige.|`|jsYy8BVeaa	No, not at all.<br>  It's either you think you are not flattered.<br>  Or it's that it is a shock since they are either really close friends of yours, or even people that you can't stand.<br>  <br>  even if the person is in a medium of both. You may just not be that confident enough. That's all i can help with i hope anything i said helps|`|XAkLPdhqaa	It's not weird to be offended by someone who likes your hot bod. First, take it as a compliment. Guys like hotties, are you offended if someone whistles at you in public? You are not being unreasonable, just unrealistic.|`|u1OJ8faAaa	a compliment is just never a compliment these days huh!! of course it's a compliment. it means you have a nice body.. would you rather prefer nobody ever did that to you ever again? you're being unreasonable..i don't know how you could ever find that offensive!|`|03rggPF2aa	i feel the same way. i actually get mad about it, or think the guy is creepy.|`|1kXHZrqaaa	Omg! I feel that way allll the time! Like when a guy calls you hot instead of beautiful!<br>  Bugs me!<br>  =)|`|mDMnhqwdaa	I feel that way at times too, i thought i were the only one.|`|M9tH99gfaa	yeh i feel the same way sometimes =\
fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	I get from your user name that you have a low opinion of yourself.  Something terrible has happened here, but no one died, and no one is marked for life with a brand across their forehead.  This too shall pass my dear.  Give it 3 days and things will be much better.  It is not your fault that this person has a bad drunk driving record.  Don't be responsible for that.  <br>  He is not all you have to live for.  Live for YOU.  You are worthy of an enjoyable life.  Jesus Christ came to earth to give us an abundant life if we accept Him and follow Him.  Crack open that Bible and look for some help in Psalms and Proverbs.  Jesus died on the cross for you.  So please get a pretty user name that fits the pretty you inside and out that you deserve to be.  Don't define your life by your 'guy'.  In the future if you want a guy, look for a Christian mate without a police record.  Look up and plead to God, He is there with you now.|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	sure, take the easy way out and leave ur boyfriend alone<br>  that sounds nice.<br>  most suicides only want atention. Be real.<br>  if u really wanna die, kill urself, i dont care but think of what ur gonna make ur boyfriend go through! ur gonna make HIM feel worse than u.<br>  think about it.<br>  u cant think of life like its nothing.<br>  <br>  its not that big a deal, people make mistakes and them move on and its not like he murdered anyone, its not that bad as long as it doesnt happen again|`|6t76bgS3aa	I don't think they put people in jail for drunk driving and even if they did it wouldn't be for very long ... so don't kill yourself.|`|133a80b8f446ced791ae790df571f049aa	This sounds like a silly reason to kill yourself.<br>  <br>  You never forced him to drink and drive in the first place.  And quite frankly, he's not going to go to prison over it.  It's not nearly as big a deal as you're making it out to be.<br>  <br>  And how is killing yourself really going to make anything better?  It will cause even MORE problems for him so if you really love him, you would suck it up, put on your big girl pants and just deal with the consequences.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you need some counseling.  I recommend calling a suicide hotline. (1-800-Suicide)<br>  <br>  If you have any doubt in your mind about whether or not to kill yourself, then hold off on it.|`|gnIEDg6maa	I assume he is an adult. He is responsible for his own actions. Were both of you drinking?  If so, when you said,"You drive.",  he should have said,"Lets call a cab.", or something similar.  You didn't hold a gun on him and make him drive. Look at it this way.  He is experienced at going to jail.  His record is already ruined, be glad you didn't mess yours up.  Good decision!  As to your question-- carbon monoxide, pills,  even bleeding out is painless but save it for when you have a terminal cancer, get your face ripped off by a wild animal or something else serious.  This is NOT serious. Unless you are over 50 years of age, there is no shortage of men.  This one will probably come back and if not, another will be along soon.|`|l2BjWA5Baa	I know you don't want to hear it, but please, please don't do this.  Think of it this way: if you feel this bad because he might be separated from you for a short time (in jail), imagine how his world will end if you kill yourself and are permanently away from him.  If you can't deal with the pain of not being near him, why in the world would you want to force the same thing on him? The best way to show him you love him is to be there for him, not selfishly trying to find a way out of your own guilt.  He'll forgive you! In the meantime, focus on something else - suicide is a permenent solution for a temporary problem.|`|756d997cb8cac9f5194b6edf128dc815aa	Get help!

Everybody goes through hard time. You are going through something really rough right now, but its not worth dying. Telling someone to drive a car doesnt make it your fault. You arent responsible for his decision to say yes. you need to see a couselor ASAP. If you really feel like your going to hurt yourself call 911 ASAP. they will take you to the hospital and get you a phsycologist right away. Please dont do this just get help and once you are better you'll see that everything is okay. <br>  <br>  If you need any help or want to talk you can email me through my yahoo page.

b5tf7EkTaa	I have experienced these things as a teenager, at the time what caused it was all the stress I was going through.  <br>  <br>  would you mind if I gave you a bit of psychology regarding this.  There is a psychological reason why a person has the urges to do such things.  And once you understand the WHYs, then it's easier for you to stop the behaviour.   Usually when a person feels like binging or purging, its to emotionally suffocate or bury something they are having a hard time overcoming and they want to get rid of it of block it.  Binging for blocking and bulimia for purging, getting rid of the situation. Emotions are things that cannot be blocked completely, they always find a way to manifest.<br>  <br>  They always say that your body always speaks to you, well it's true.  Think about it, is there something in your life right now that you are having difficulty dealing with, a big stress that you feel that is insurmountable. When you will be able to deal with that situation, your binging and bulimia will stop.  But you will need help, you cannot do this on your own, if you've done it for a long time, you might have caused your body some damages and you will need medical help for that. and you will also need help for the emotional part.  I'll be honnest, It won't be an easy and fast recovery, it will take some time and a lot of work.    <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, take good care, and don't give up;|`|eMPeOsRBaa	i not a very open person, even with my closest friends. so when i finally did open up to a counselor i was nervous at first. but then, she was way more understanding than I would have expected.<br>  Good luck.<br>  If you need or want some help, e-mail me at...<br>  anabelle.fray@yahoo.com|`|WwTp6sGxaa	Let's see, I had horrible anorexia for awhile, turns out it was due to my OCD.

Symptoms may not show up right now, but if you continue at this pace they very likely will into middle age. <br>  <br>  As far as now - you may be outrunning people because you're just a more talented athlete.<br>  <br>  Cigarettes contain more carcinogens (noxious chemicals), but in general, pot is inhaled longer and deeper into the lungs than cigarette smoke - the damage is taking place because of that. It doesn't appear on the outside, in fact it's not always easily detectable. But it can cause severe lung problems later in life.|`|b7vdkAAIaa	i think that study is skewed comparing an entire joint to an entire cigarette - for one, a joint will not be filtered, and one is much less likely to smoke an entire joint, as one would smoke an entire cigarette - and both have smoke, particulate matter, and some tar<br>  <br>  but cigarettes have way more chemicals and nicotine which is the addictive carcinogen - marijuana has no carcinogens that I've ever heard of - and in fact there are some recent studies showing that it can help curb lung cancer<br>  <br>  those studies are skewed IMHO to dissuade people from MJ and not much else - just as the congressional testimony of William Hearst was skewed - to serve a purpose rather than to serve the absolute truth|`|uDl5lUtdaa	I've never heard anything like that..<br>  <br>  cigarettes are way worse, I think they're full of sh*t.|`|NUbExZkZaa	I'm guessing the cigarette companies did that study.|`|fO2rv38Baa	dude that's bs. cigarettes are way worse.|`|UjXQriuKaa	yea i heard that
apNmPcvHaa	Stop, Take a deep breath, and relax....<br>  <br>  As a student of the school he works at, you CAN'T do anything, not even express your feelings.  It isn't morally right, and it can cost him his job, and quite possibly (if it goes far enough) jail time.<br>  <br>  If the 'love' you are feeling is real, and you really want to be with him, wait until you graduate and turn 18, then let him know. After you graduate and are 18, anything goes.  He is no longer held by minority laws, and you will not be one of the students so no legal trouble can come from that.  When you graduated, it can be any type of relationship you want.  <br>  <br>  So just relax and wait.  when the time comes, let him know, and then he will tell you how he feels. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck, I went through a similar thing with one of my teachers to.  It worked to, we dated for a few months and is still one of my best friends.|`|C6to7ExVaa	The best thing to do is actually, tell your teacher. It's possibly the only way for you to try to move on, because he has a chance of cutting you down, but. It's strangely unhealthy to have a crush on your teacher, since he might be married.|`|TjQAs0BKaa	I'm not really sure what you can do, but for now the relationship is illegel. Once you graduate, it will be legal. Maybe what you should do is stay in contact with him, get his email address (for homework purposes of course, wink wink), then over the summer, email him. Maybe you can start hanging out later. Don't let the age gap get in the way. Yes he's more mature and may be a bit more demanding, but do not let anyone tell you otherwise. That's how you feel about him, and it's almost impossible to change it. I think my uncle is 11-13 years older than my aunt... I'm not sure, but they are very happily married. No it was not an arranged marriage ;o) so there are people out there with relationships like what you want. Now just wait for the summer... then make your move!<br>  <br>  *an excuse to hang out over the summer is to ask about uni life =]|`|KX8oWwDzaa	Ask him to give you some "private tutoring"|`|7tJNspGNaa	I would definitely suggest trying to distract yourself with someone your own age. I wouldn't tell your teacher because of legal obligations he may have - it may prevent you from contact with him.<br>  <br>  After you graduate, keep him in contact, if he's as great as you say he is, then he'll definitely be a wonderful investment as a lifelong friend. <br>  <br>  Age doesn't matter much after you turn 18, and it is plenty possible that you can continue the relationship you have with him once you leave the institution. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say "wait for him" until you graduate; it's not realistic. Just try to move along with your own crowd, it'll be better with experience. <br>  <br>  Good luck !

Usually safe in the late teens.|`|NbOCIyBPaa	yes it will actually make you shrink...most giants do it so that they are average height|`|RoqVeuLmaa	I agree with madroxkr...  The biggest problems occur with "maxing out", which should never be performed in any weight routine until late puberty and growth has nearly stopped.  Lighter weights are safer, but not completely for an early adolescent.  Another unpopular opinion:  squats are out.  There are other ways to build quad/glute strength that don't put the same stresses on the back.|`|jW7Fkwhnaa	hasnt stunted mine i've been doing that 4 like 1 1/2 years and still growing

AA11020187	8mm is small as far as tumor size goes. Considering she was on chemo while this grew it is not good. If she were responding to treatment it would get smaller and she would not have new tumors. Bone cancer is a completely different issue and this is not what your mother has – it is still breast cancer. They may do radiation if they are causing her pain. They will probably try a different chemo regimen and hopefully she will respond better.|`|AA10063059	look i am sorry but it is bad,it is still growing and spreading and it is secondary which is never good

XR7qbeKcaa	okay so seriously, people who have no experience should NOT be trying to give you answers to this. <br>  <br>  However, I was 16 when I had my daughter, 15 when I was pregnant. Now my lovely daughter is almost 4! <br>  <br>  Being pregnant is SOOO scary at first, I didn't tell anyone, but she should tell your father. My parents held it over my head for sooo long once I had my daughter, and your sister is going to need support.<br>  <br>  As for the boyfriend, forget him! I am not with my daughters father and happier then I ever was with him. Any guy that tells you to kill an innocent child without caring what the girls opinion is, is worthless and doesnt deserve to even be in that childs life. And a innocent child doesn't deserve to have someone like that in his/her life.<br>  <br>  Mother's need to be mature and put together, a role model, so if your sister is going to cry a river over this boy and chase and beg and act like a 5 year old when they want a piece of candy at dinner time, then she needs to do what is best for the child and either abort if she feels that is in her moral standards, or to give the child up for adoption. She needs to sit down with a clear head and think about what she really wants because a child is for the rest of her life, someone to love unconditionally, and she needs to realize her childhood is going to be over. <br>  <br>  I was kind of a trouble maker/class clown/bad grades the whole nine yards in school, then i dropped out because i was 4 days away from giving birth to my daughter (not that i knew that at the time.) But something happened when I had my daughter, I grew up. I hate drama, I got back into school and graduated EARLY, and love my life. So don't let her think her life is going to be over, a new one will just begin.|`|aac53ff9dbd8d5d1e73791e8d54b6c6faa	If she wants to keep the baby, let her keep it, also tell your dad. The bf doesn't want a baby, cuz he doesn't want a committment and he's scared. But he will just have to pay child support each monthl, so your sister can feed herself for her baby and buy diapers and what not. I'm totally against abortion, that's killing an innocent human being, except if it's an ectopic, than you have to abort.|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	if they could afford the baby and take care of it properly then have it but if it forces her orr her bf outta school then u might have to abort it and then theyll use it for fetus research..which is legal causee obama likes men|`|r41AlP3Uaa	I don't have any siblings that became pregnant, but a lot of my friends have gotten knocked up. Im 17 and my friends that have become pregnant are 17 also. They also started panicking when they first found out. But you just got to tell her that she needs to suck it up, dont kill the baby, and she needs to start planning her future. Maybe start considering if she wants to give it up for adoption so she can live a semi-normal life, or keep it and have to work hard to support the baby. The boyfriend should be helping too. Maybe get a job to start saving up. Soooo all you can really tell her is to start acting mature and make smart choices for her baby and herself since she has already made the choice to have sex. Im not against sex or anything, but if you make the choice to do it, you got to b prepared for the aftermath. Im sure everything will be fine with her, and you shouldnt be taking care of her, its going to cause you to stress out and go crazy, and i dont think that would be very good. I hope I helped somewhat.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	I think you both are too young and immature so you should talk to your dad, or maybe an aunt who would know what to do in this situation.|`|qGOxMYpHaa	since your the mature one, i strongly suggest you make a large list of pros and cons on a sheet of presentation cardboard for your sister.  present it to her and give her a imaginative scenario of what it would be like for each con and pro and then let her make the decision.  it has NOTHING to do with her bf if she wants to keep it and if she does, he has to pay child support because it takes 2 to make a baby.  a man is not a man if he doesn't take responsibility.  i've never met you but from what i hear, coming from your situation, you should be proud you can handle all this.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	really it up to her what she want to do  not you   , it a baby   not a doll, it the biggest decision  she will have to make in her life,,,and your dad need to no straight away as she on 17 and still under his care ,,,yes  i think the child soon to adopted out , for it future life to a loving family|`|35u9RVVFaa	if she's 17, then she'll probly turn 18 before she has the baby so wait till she turns 18, then tll your dad, uz then he can't do annything about it|`|u1OJ8faAaa	HA HA!!!!!!..... y'all stupid!!|`|7M3JTnbxaa	The one person who absolutely has to know is her boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Honestly, your best option would be for her to get an abortion, but if she thinks that's not something she wants to do I can respect that.<br>  <br>  Problem is, if she has the baby, your dad will probably find out. <br>  <br>  Is she responsible enough to have this child? If not, consider giving it to adoption. If she is going to go through with the pregnancy, she must have the baby's best interests in mind, and if she cannot give it what it needs, she should give it to someone who is more responsible and would take better care of him or her.
07YBD5mJaa	Try Pilate's.<br>  I have been doing Pilate's for a few months and I am very pleased with the results.

I believe that mine cost just under $30.00.<br>  Best wishes!|`|MJyM1XWJaa	eat what you want in moderation. Diet shouldn't be about fad diets or deprivation, it's about portion control and eating the things your body needs. You'd be surprised how much better you feel and the energy you'll have on a healthy diet. <br>  <br>  Muffin top means you're eating too much of the wrong thing usually, so fat builds in that area. Exercising the area will likely turn that fat into muscle, not really what you want at all. Learn what the proper portion sizes are and drink lots of water/green tea.|`|SfatAG9Gaa	Yea I had the same problem. Try laying on you back in your bed (very comfy), and "peddling" with your feet in the air. Sort of like peddling a bicycle but upside down lol.

That exercise routine will keep it from getting bigger...<br>  <br>  Perhaps if you lower the amount of the fun food...to smaller portions and maybe try to just not have them as often...and cut out pasteries and chocolate and soda pop--even diet has tons of sodium=water retention--you will be just fine and feel very good and energized too. Try it--it's worth it...and have a fun giant meal every once in a while as a treat...then go back to the healthier way of eating...it's better for your heart too anyhow-you don't want clogged arteries. Can cause heart peoblems...not to mention you'd be at risk of diabetes etc...<br>  ========<br>  Update response:<br>  Oh I thought Muffin Top was referring to butt...so it's your tummy...ok--do crunches...tons of them and taking a break...<br>  Now-you are 13...yes so your butt is not that hormone change yet.

j1Js4uuTaa	I know exactly how you feel. I'm an 18 year old girl, had my braces on for 2 years now, I should be getting them off in about 4 months. It's true I remember first getting them on it felt like I had SO much stuff in my mouth and it felt weird to do anything. But you do really get used to it. Depending on the person maybe a week or a month. They're uncomfortable and painful at times but inbetween it should be fine. I hated having mine on but it's all worth it in the end.|`|5Imaqngeaa	You will get used to them of course. They will be off before you know it, and they are SO WORTH IT.  Keep them on as long as the orthodontist recommends too, even if its longer than you thougt, trust me its worth it to have PERFECT teeth for the rest of your life. You only have to suffer for a short period of time, compare that to a whole  lifetime of Beautiful teeth! :D|`|yhTADz7Naa	Yes , you will get used to them after about a day or two. Then once about a week has gone by you won't even notice they are there!! If the pain gets bad take Tyneol or Advil or even Paracetamol!!

Trust me you will get used to them within about two weeks. I had habits of snagging my lip on the brackets, and I always had to clean them after everything I ate (normally, by *this kind of sounds gross, but if you have braces you will understand* sucking out the food caught in the bracket. Now that I have them off, I realize that I had those habits. I was very comfortable in mine; I had them for 2 years, 2 months, and 13 days. (Yes, I know.) <br>  Oh, and by the way, they tell you 18 months, but if you take care of them, it will be much less. My friend was told a year and a half, she only had them for 6 months.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	Yes, you do get used to them in about 3 days or more. I'm younger than you. When you get them tightened they don't hurt (at least for me). Since you just got them 4 hours ago here is some info.<br>  <br>  <br>  Getting your braces put on doesn't hurt at all. Its after 4-6 hours it gets sore so take Advil right after so it doesn't hurt. Eat soft foods for a week or so such as yogurt,smoothies,ice cream,jello,and others. Here is some information about braces. Also tightening means they take out the old wire and replace it with a thicker and shorter wire. That doesn't hurt. If it does just tak a painkiller. <br>  <br>  <br>  WEBSITES<br>  1. <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf..." rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf...</a><br>  2. <a href="http://www.bracesinfo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bracesinfo.com/</a><br>  3. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac...</a><br>  4. <a href="http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br..." rel="nofollow">http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br...</a><br>  5. <a href="http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h...</a><br>  <br>  PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES<br>  1.

1thElV58aa	your suppose to take the pill ever day at a certain time. If you keep on skipping it you can spot for weeks and mess up your cycle. if your not going to take it properly dont even take it at all. try taking the depo shot instead , but you can gain alot of weight on it.|`|YHwVw2pdaa	It depends on how much you are bleeding after you have stopped on taking the pills. If it is only like spots then it should be okie. Usually there shouldnt be bleeding even if you stop taking the pills until your period comes. And it should be a full period. The point of taking the pills for most women is because they dont want to get pregnant and for others it is because they dont have regular periods so taking it can make their period regularly. you might have a irregular period because you have stopped using the pills. if you are not sure about it or have questions, i think you should ask your doctor about it and they should tell you what you should do. hope this helps you =]
dcWN4v6Jaa	Yes, you can avoid flossing for a week. Just brush really good for 2 minutes and use mouthwash. It doesn't cause gaps.|`|ReB7knjcaa	I have had braces myself so I do know what you mean...But to let you in on a little secret dont "FLOSS" to much cause in the end you will have,HORSE SIZE TEETH", and you will look like you have chicklets=mexican gum size teeth if that's what you want..or look like you have 50cents BIG A** Teeth...|`|GuSSIIDJaa	when you first get braces put on they hurt for a little while. maybe take a few days off from flossing to let your teeth get used to the braces.<br>  in the meantime, you should go onto brytonpick.com and check out this flossing device that makes flossing with braces super fast and easy! its a portable flosser so you will be able to carry it with you in case you get food stuck in your braces too! it works really well!

Prayer does help.  Being fortunate of what you currently have.  That you are not in jail, or in the hospital.  Being thankful that you woke up today. Some people didn't make it.  I think you just need a change in your life..some excitement.

DYUfnPzhaa	It actually does matter...  I know this is frustrating because its not the answer you want to hear, but as I work for an Optometrist, I know that each little decimal with a base curve counts.  8.6.. 8.7... 8.8  are all unique.  The base curve is the radius of the sphere of the back of the contact lens that the prescription describes. Contact lenses must fit well to the wearer's cornea in order to be comfortable and to facilitate tear exchange and oxygen transmission. Never switch base curves on your own.  More serious things than blurred vision may result.|`|8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	It's a gamble at best.<br>  <br>  Even the same BC from a different manufacturer can fit differently: there are a lot of other fitting parameters implicit in the brand name.<br>  (A Ford is not a Toyota) <br>  FCOD, and peripheral tapering,<br>  BCOD (or asphericity)<br>  Lens material (and its flexure)<br>  Thickness.<br>  <br>  In contact lenses, rather differently from spectacle frames, the brand is part of the Rx <br>  (In spectacle lenses it applies with varifocal designs...)<br>  <br>  The only safe way is a proper trial and a new issued Rx.<br>  Anything else is gambling, even if you can get the lenses legally <br>  (unlikely, in most countries)

So I am sure there are ways around it (like bringing somebody's sample with you).  <br>  <br>  I am not sure how long that weed will stay in your system and you may be fine in a week or two.  I will note that I was interviewed twice for Home depot before they hired me with a week seperating them, so you may be fine.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Best thing for you to do is go to the drug store and buy a home drug test.  Cost about $15 and are identical to the ones they use.<br>  <br>  Lay off the weed you.|`|5372aOmFaa	i don't know what kind of test they give, but when i had to pass both my urine and hair tests, i went to a local head shop and bought some detox juice, and detox shampoo.. both worked like a charm. i smoked a week before the hair test and passed it.
uFRIsdC7aa	YOU NEED TO BE CHECK OUT. TO SEE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ALL OF THAT.BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAY THE INGREDIENTS IS IN EVERYTHING.|`|9yP43Peiaa	If those ingredients are in everything then surely you would have already eaten it and been ok.. Maybe its just large quantities that you cant handle. Corn allergies are not fatal, so you can risk trying things.|`|Qxh1kPLfaa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  If you are allergic to corn, you are allergic to all that also.  <br>  <br>  The confusing part comes in in that you may not have the same severity of reaction as you would with straight out corn.  Keep in mind that it is still doing damage to the body even if you are not having your "bad" reaction.

If so then you must have moved something out of place, but most likely you may have pushed the two bones (that are connected to that knuckle) together and it could have squeezed a tendon in it or the actual cartalege stuff in your knuckle. Ice it for a week or two, maybe a little bit of heat compressions now and then, and if it does not feel better, do see a doctor to get an x-ray and see if you split the bone (could be a small split since there is no swelling or bruising) but im sure icing and heating will work.

NQGpw0x4aa	a lot of orthodontists have payment plans. and if you follow their every direction, it will not take as long and will be cheaper|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	Most orthodontists have payment plans. You can pay by month by month. My parents paid full price at once. Do you have insurance? If you do it will lower the cost a tad by about $1000 which is great. Ask your orthodontist about these payment plans. However, if you do get braces here is some info.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Getting your braces put on doesn't hurt at all. Its after 4-6 hours it gets sore so take Advil right after so it doesn't hurt. Eat soft foods for a week or so such as yogurt,smoothies,ice cream,jello,and others. Here is some information about braces. Also tightening means they take out the old wire and replace it with a thicker and shorter wire. That doesn't hurt. If it does just tak a painkiller. <br>  <br>  <br>  WEBSITES<br>  1. <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf..." rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf...</a><br>  2. <a href="http://www.bracesinfo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bracesinfo.com/</a><br>  3. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac...</a><br>  4. <a href="http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br..." rel="nofollow">http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br...</a><br>  5. <a href="http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h...</a><br>  <br>  PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES<br>  1.

7186c731ce4bffdfe601e724c1bf04eeaa	uhhh..... sure :D<br>  <br>  IDK...... ADD does have social issues too... like it is hard to make and keep friends... usually it is just more a big circle of loose acquaintances, it is easier that way :P<br>  <br>  It is hard for ADD'ers to pick up on little social cues and stuff. They often step on toes w/o even meaning to. Social things are weird for ADD'ers since usually there is lots of rejection since they always end up being the weird kids since they can't follow along properly and when they talk it is all things from their head that make no sense to other people who don't make the connections.<br>  <br>  I don't really know how to answer your question... but it seems like you feel abandoned by this dude who prolly just up and left and stopped talking with you for whatev reason. It prolly don't phase him nearly as much. ADD'ers are very easy to lose contact with people since really they just forget to actually follow through and keep a relationship going. Plus there is so much work in maintaining it is like why bother?<br>  <br>   BUT>>> I would say ADD'ers have a need and a love for connecting with people... and they get lonely and frustrated when they find that they have pushed people away... even more so when they can't really get them back
KbBFugvFaa	Two hours is not a long way if it means improving your mental health.Seek a second opinion at least.<br>  If you really feel you cannot go to someone else then sit with your doc and say I would really like to try something else , I don't feel the Lexapro is helping me, Use example as to how you feel and the length of time you have been on Lexapro with these continued feelings.

There are categories that may offer more medical opinion and advice but if you will allow my two cents as Health than please listen.<br>  <br>  ready?<br>  <br>  I know this may seem a little trite however I'll be brief and to the point.  <br>  Keep taking your prescription.  With all the information your Doctors have it's hard to fail in not helping in some way.<br>  Yet... if I may be so bold  there's always a goal.... I don't mean a goal like getting your dishes done before bed or all your homework from the classes you obviously are taking no, I mean a goal.<br>  A dream come true.  Something so majestic and fantastic that you wouldn't believe it if somebody just walked up to you and gave it all to you.  Make it big.  The bigger the better.  The sky is the limit.  Set it to come true in about say ten years and stand back... maybe even exhale a little.  <br>  It comes true.  It always comes true.  At first it'll be little things that you may well say are just coincidence.  but pretty soon things start to happen that you will just have to take for granted.<br>  You'll meet powerful and influential people.  You'll gain access to resources you never would have dreamed possible.  The whole Universe will seem to conspire to make your dream come true come true.<br>  The trick for me is to not be like a rowboat without a rudder.  <br>  Pretty soon you won't have time for such uncomfotable things like depression or even Mania...everything seems to fall into place... <br>  Hope so... good luck.|`|cs0YDOTbaa	make art.  whatever you think is art that you can make, just do it.

You can even get heart disease if you dont take care of a cavity. I know it sounds crazy but its true, many people have actually died from a little old cavity.

He or she will ask you to you what brings you in today? you will discuss any concerns you may have and answer any questions you may have.<br>  After the answering of your questions you will be asked to lie back. The doctor will perform a breast exam which consists of you lying on the table with arms above your head. Your breasts will be examined for any unusual lumps, or soreness.<br>  The doctor will then feel around your abdomen. After checking your abdomen you will be asked to scoot your bottom to the end of the table and place your feet in the stirups. You will be asked to allow your legs to fall to the sides with your feet remaining in the stirrups.<br>  At this time the doctor will examine the outer genital area. Dont worry the nurse will be present. Your doctor will then lubricate a speculum and slowly insert it into your vagina. The speculum is used to open the vaginal walls to help gain visibility inside the vagina. The Doctor will then open the speculum and adjust the light so that it provides adequate lighting inside the vagina. The Doctor will then use a swab to gather some cells from your cervix. These cells will be sent to the lab for testing. The speculum will then be removed.The Doctor will then lubricate the fingers on their glove and insert one or two fingers inside the vagina while using the hand outside pressing down above the pelvic bone. This portion of the exam is now complete.<br>  Some Doctors may choose to do a rectal exam which consists of inserting one finger inside your rectum to feel for hemmoroids or other abnormalities.<br>  At this time you will be asked if you have any questions and given a tissue to wipe off any excess lubricant used during exam.<br>  The Doctor will then leave the room allowing you to get dressed. He will reenter room once you are dressed to provide you with information concerning recieving your pap smear results and give you any prescriptions he or she may be prescribing.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	It is awkward, but it shouldn't hurt more than a slight pinch, if that. If it starts to become seriously painful, tell your doctor. They can use a smaller speculum.<br>  <br>  How old are you? I was fifteen, and I took my mother with me. (Seriously, she stood up by my head so that she couldn't see between my legs.) This may be strange, though, if you are significantly older than I was.<br>  <br>  Also, you may feel more comfortable going to a female doctor. Wear decent underwear, as well. It's probably going to be sitting in a pile in the corner of the exam room along with the rest of your clothes, and the last thing you want your doctor seeing is your stained white briefs or your "Lick Me" thong.|`|osoTq2dcaa	i text message the entire time and they cover your legs so you dont seem them down there and if no phone strike up a convo ask what she is doing down there lol trust me they dont feel awkward they chose to do that for a living|`|91s5SYoKaa	I was very worried about my first one as well.

d3GUVXjlaa	That is a good question.  Try boosting your metabolism by doing short but intense workouts daily, like running for 15 min. By doing this your metabolism will register to start burning more calories, including the ones that you burned while doing the exercise.  Also, eat breakfast and eat frequent snacks of carrots and fruits.  By eating small amounts of healthful food frequently, you will also increase you metabolism.  Before you know it, that weight will be off.  I actually wouldn’t be surprised if it came off in the next two weeks!!  Good luck!  Oh, after you get to where you want to be at with your weight, you  may want to continue exercising a couple times a week to keep that metabolism boosted!  Before you know it, you will be slim and trim!|`|9sEM4i5Kaa	find fun in dancing it off... downlaod your fav songs that get you moving, and go into the bathroom in front of the mirror with somne little tiny 1 pound weights even, and dance like no one is watching, cause no one is! makes you happy like a drug and your get hooked and its so good for you! dont wear shoes cause they get hot and you can go long without feeling hot that way!
xHJAZbgKaa	well i deal with physics a bit..so this might help you...for one...the number rule of physics is mind over matter...so i would suggest make yourself HAPPY indulge and don't think about the aftermath of it.say to yourself 100% honestly that you will be healthier if you are just happier.another thing i find that playing games like imvu , the sims 2, or SOMETHING that makes you put yourself in the persons body.makes you somewhat more like that avatar or sim.not major just slight changes. but yeah...live life to it's fullest and trust in yourself.and only happy thoughts.plus mostly liquids...not thick like milk but like water coolaid soda soup icecream juice etc. or if you can't use your mental powers..i heard putting chilli powder in lemonade and only drinking that for about a week will work....but that is a medical cleanser for the body...and be advised..when you come of it do it slowly.or you WILL loose what single bit of lunch you had........

Well, your body is still trying to regulate your cycle, so you will not have the same flow for a long time.  The brownish discharge is normal.  That is old blood that has been building up for a while.  All women have that at the start of their cycles.  Do not panic, you are normal.  If you have any questions about your cycle, talk to a family member, a sister, mother, aunt, or friends.  Just realize that your cycle will be different each month for about a year or so.

Oe7SOJyDaa	no your not fat that is a healthy weight for your height. but if you want to lose 10 pounds fast then I would suggest leaving out the junk food.  1200 calories a day plus 1 hour of exercise for 5 to 6 times a week.  you can eat chocolate and candy if you budget into your 1200 calories a day but you have get plenty of your other nutrients in there as well.  Macaroni is soooo bad for you, all that is is fat and carbs, some protein because of the cheese but it is overtaken by the fat.  Eat low fat candies or find creative ways to mix your fruit.  My fav chocolate snack is a chocolate rice cake with low fat whipped cream on top.  that is only 100 calories. and is low in fat.  Eat 5 to 6 small meals per day, eat plenty of fiber and drink water all day long. if you don't like the taste of water use Crystal light<br>  . <br>  A good breakfast can be 6oz yogurt with 1/2 an apple and a piece of whole wheat toast. <br>  <br>  A good lunch can be a whole wheat tortilla with reduced fat peanut butter and low sugar jelly. <br>  <br>   Snacks can be anything from a handful of almonds to low sodium triscuits with laughing cow cream cheese.  <br>  <br>  And dinner can be any lean 4 oz of meat or fish with lots of veggies and 1/2 cup of brown rice.<br>  <br>   For desert, go buy skinny cow ice cream.  They have these chocolate dipped ice cream cycles that are only 80 calories for one<br>  <br>  . Girl i got so many ideas, email me if you want any more. You just got to think healthy. Use lean ground turkey instead of ground beef and substitute reduced fat cheese for the full fat cheese, and drink skim milk instead of whole milk.  It takes 14 days for your tongue to get used to different tastes. But by that time the weight will be off. Good luck!|`|20CuHyo8aa	120 is a little on the heavy side  if you are small boned but probably okay if you are big boned.  You probably don't want to gain anymore.<br>  <br>  I find that if I just cut out all junk food it's easier than restricting it.  I don't drink any type of soda -diet or regular and haven't in ages.<br>  <br>  You probably can't (or shouldn't) lose 10 lbs. fast.  What you need to do is change your whole approach to eating.  Eat less food and eat good, whole food.   I don't know why but when I eat processed foods - chips, donuts, candy- I start obsessing about food.  Perhaps it's because the junk is just empty calories and my body is still looking for the good stuff -protein,fats, vitamins, minerals.  <br>  There is a wonderful book "Nutrition and Physical Degeneration" by Weston Price, DDS.  It's an old book that is back in print because young people are rediscovering the wisdom of eating whole foods. <br>  Eating well isn't going on a diet.  It's a life-style and a life-long change.<br>  <br>  I know someone who was 5 ft 3 and 140 lbs when she was 17.  Her mom told her she needed to change.  She did.  She started eating good food in balance and exercising and reduced her weight to about 112-115.  She's in her fifties now and she still weighs about the same weight.  She gained once when she was pregnant, which of course is normal and healthy, but aside from that she's always maintained her lower weight because she made a life-style change.<br>  Hope that encourages to stay away from the junk.<br>  :)|`|juyJY3Lraa	no your sexy dont let ayone bring u down|`|3Y1ondDraa	Develop a like for fruit!

qIAcO0gGaa	Masturbation is a very personal thing. Even though the internet makes it seem completely normal some people are not comfortable doing it. There is no right or wrong way to do it. You decide what feels good by touching every part of you. You decide how often you like touching yourself. No one can tell you whats right or wrong when comes to you and your body. Masturbation should also be called self discovery :) So dont be embarrased everyone does it. I looked up this site for you hopefully it answers your question <a href="http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2001/if-20010816p115.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2001/if-...</a>|`|3TyrAZwMaa	well seeing as your a girl you can experiment in many ways. there are 3 main orgasms (that you hope to have)<br>  <br>  1) the clitoral orgasm. this orgasm is achieved by touching the clitoris with a hand or an object. also something that vibrates helps to achieve this orgasm. Another main way is by using rushing water. main example- the shower head. if you point the water at your clitoris it feels good.<br>  <br>  2)  vaginal orgasm. this orgasm comes by inserting things into your vagina. (like a hand, toy, pencils etc..) Although this orgasm is a bit more difficult to achieve, it is the more common orgasm while you have sex.<br>  <br>  3) Anal orgasm. This orgasm comes by inserting objects into your anus. this is the hardest orgasm to achieve because many women find it either gross, or it doesn't feel good. if you decide to try this one, use something small at first, and work your way up to larger objects. use lots of lubrication, and do not put the object in your vagina after it is in the anus. it may cause a number of diseases.|`|jJAbRdY8aa	i usually do it twice or thrice in a month and sometimes occasionaly, usually with a sex story book or by watching porn movies or thinking of having sex with a beautful girl or actress or some sexy girl i have seen on that particular day.<br>  <br>  it gives pleasure...|`|aLrsWMSqaa	well you can watch porn , and rub the outer rim of vagina or stick 2 fingers in a nd rub or you can use dildo !|`|2MredfRwaa	alright if your serious here it is.. everyone else on here is an idiot<br>  <br>  if your a none visual person<br>  just think about someone you find very attractive and picture them doin anything you want to you or you doin to  them whatever. and rub your clit(clitoris) aka the little ball. and it might tickle but just keep doing it you can rub it hard or slow or soft or gentle and then you can spread your lips with your fingers and you might feel wet you might not depening on how aroused you are feeling and you can insert and take out your fingers into your vagina or lick your fingers and do it whatever no one is watching you and you are making yourself feel good so jst drop everything any stress any whatever and just let go and feel good.|`|5Imaqngeaa	Its depends on what you like.

LHJTrJreaa	WELL you certainly don't pick the scab off unless you want a crater face. I know they say that you're not meant to pop pimples at all (which is true), but when they get all pussy and festy they just got to go. I usually just insert a needle CAREFULLY into the pimple, squeeze out the gross stuff then put tea tree oil over it. You need to make sure that no bacteria or dirt gets inside your pore once the pimple is gone. And don't ever pick scabs off.I don't know why the pimple looks so bad now, maybe you didn't squeeze it properly. Just don't irritate it, and let it heal on its own.|`|bvnSjdmeaa	you just gave yourself a chemical burn...leave it alone...maybe try a frozen bag of peas to reduce the swelling and redness|`|kCrB3OgUaa	Leave it.

CDbawVldaa	Well first thing I would do is drop the creatine for now. Creatine is a helpful supplement but only if you are already eating and training properly (which from your lack of results shows that your not).<br>  <br>  If you are not gaining any weight it means that you are not eating enough. I'd recommend eating atleast 3000 calories a day spread throughout 5 - 6 meals. Each meal should consist of lots of protein and carbohydrates. <br>  <br>  I am also assuming that you are lifting weights atleast 3 times a week. If you are not you should start. Make sure you are working your entire body (upper and lower) and not just your beach muscles (arms and abs). <br>  <br>  Also remember that putting on good weight (meaning muscle mass and not just fat) takes time. Putting on 15 - 20 pounds will probably take you 8 - 12 weeks of consistent heavy eating and weight training. <br>  <br>  Here is a sample of a simple weight lifting routine you could follow if you don't already have one...<br>  <a href="http://www.profatlossadvisor.com/fat-loss-exercise-plan/" rel="nofollow">http://www.profatlossadvisor.com/fat-los...</a>|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Who told you to take creatine? A magazine ad? <br>  Creatine isnt very effective man. <br>  <br>  Nothing will put weight on you like natural foods will. <br>  (Foods high in protein)<br>  peanutbutter,nuts,milk,meats ect.<br>  <br>  Creatine is pretty much pointless if you arent consuming enough protein.<br>  Consume 1 gram of protein per lb. you weigh. <br>  <br>  You weigh 150 lbs. so consume atleast 150grams of protein per day for your muscle's to grow.<br>  <br>  drink atleast 8 glasses of water per day.<br>  SLEEP atleast 8 hours per night because your muscles build when you are sleeping not when you are working out.<br>  <br>  and lift heavy weights.|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Your not drinking enough water, when on creatine you should be drinking about 1.5 gallons of water per day.

YHwVw2pdaa	I'm not sure if you can say it is normal or not because different women react differently when they stop taking birth control pills. I remember when I stopped taking bc my period came pretty heavy too. But it was only once in a while it would come heavy and like the next month it would be normal and not as heavy. You can go to your doctor and ask them why you are having a heavy period all of a sudden, but i think its normal once you stop taking birth control pills. And also once you stop using birth control pills your period might come irregularly. Because usually birth control pills are suppose to make your period come regularly. hope this will help you! =]|`|dvQYaRNDaa	Its normal to bleed after you stop the pill however you're bleeding too much. If it continues like that for another day get to a doctor.<br>  <br>  Personally when I stopped my BC pills I didn't bleed or anything. Heck I still haven't had a period since stopping (in November 08), but thats just me. Every woman is different.
erGOrzEiaa	Almost nothing in science or medicine is completely 100% but unless he was having an outbreak at the time it's pretty unlikely but if he was having an outbreak at the time and you just didn't see it is pretty likely. Transmission is very easy when there is an outbreak but if he wasn't then well, 99+% of the population has oral herpes and oral sex is pretty common, and not everyone gets HSV-1 on their genitals from that.<br>  <br>  Either way if you're at all worried see if you show any symptoms and if you do go to a doctor and get them tested (most herpes tests are done by surface samples).<br>  Either way you should ask a doctor about it as they could tell you better.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	The chances are very likely you will get herpes.

QxF783Ipaa	I would wash your face thoroughly every couple of days. You can also use acne medication such as Clearasil. In order to prevent acne, watch your diet. I know you're 14 years old and its difficult to control your diet at a younger age but its extremely important.<br>  <br>  Washing your face at least twice a day with a natural or commercial solution will keep outbreaks to a minimum and control the infections you already may have.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can control, reduce or eliminate acne through dietary means. Your body's acidity level (pH) has a lot to do with your glands' oil production. If you can reduce the food and drink in your diet that are acidic, you'll be able to reduce your prevent acne. Carbonated beverages are a major culprit and should be replaced with water.

D5N0bAAnaa	Forget anyone who says abortion isn't an option. Its ultimately her choice, and even though you may not want her to get one, in this situation it seems to be the best answer. Yes, adoption would be nice, but with her going away to school, it would be very difficult to find a family and go to the doctor, etc. You're both obviously young, and probably should have had a plan for if this happened before (my boyfriend and I do), but stuff happens. Since you made the choice to have sex, you have to grow up very quickly and take on the responsibility of how to deal with this. I wish you both luck and hope all turns out well.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	If she's from an Orthodox Jewish family then she should know better than to abort an innocent unborn child.

If you truly want the baby you should fight for it. Go to her parents and confess no matter the judgement you might get. No religion should kill.

Life is not about how you planned it but how you deal with the obstacles that come your way. 18 years from now what is more important? A girls ivy league education or a child you both created.

Scars are what remain after the wound has completely healed. Scars themselves do not heal; they are permanent. The color will fade, though, which is what I think you're asking about; the newer the scar, the better scar creams will work.<br>  I've had some 2nd degree burns and in my experience it took about 6 months from the time I got burned to the time the scars were white. HOWEVER, I did not use any sort of scar reducers/faders on my scars. Since you are, yours should fade considerably faster. I would guess perhaps a month or two. Also, the size of the scar doesn't affect how fast it fades; it's the depth of the scar that does. The deeper the wound went, the thicker the scar tissue, the longer it takes to fade.|`|ZQMjPCDxaa	Scars don't always heal. For the most part, they always remain as at least a slight discoloration. I'm sure that the ointments you are using will help them clear up a little, but chances are you will always have a mark.|`|lfvBOYIWaa	My little girl was burned by fireworks 5 years ago and when we took her to the hospital they informed us that she had second and third degree burnson her neck and head.

In two or three months there were no visible scars,however the area is still sensitive.

Drink at least three full glasses of water each day, including one before bedtime. Also drink plenty of fluid before, during, and after exercise. <br>  <br>  Stretch Regularly<br>  Stretching can relax muscle fibers.

Also consider NeuroLinguistic Programming as a form of therapy worth trying. learn to face your fear. Consider; what is the worst that can happen? You may vomit, or someone vomits on you.

Go into the doctor and ask him/her how you should go about controlling it. Some will give out medications, others will try and give you methods of calming yourself down.<br>  <br>  Personally, I get panic attacks when there's too much stress. I can hardly breathe, cough uncontrollably, break out in a sweat, and nearly pass out because I get so light headed from not breathing right and coughing so much. I just mentally try and calm myself down and sip water. I often feel nauseous, too, so I try hard to think that I'm not going to throw up and not cough. Sometimes they last up to half an hour, or just five minutes. But I do know that when I mentally calm myself down, I feel a lot better.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could try that? If you can't calm yourself down, go into a doctor. They'll help you out!|`|vKvNDPbDaa	just think to yourself, what's the worst that could happen?  you vomit, so then you will be fine.  nothing bad will happen from it.  once you prepare for the worst that could happen and realized you'll be fine you can take the power of the fear away:)|`|yEMRPW1Aaa	you need to try medication for it or talk to someone about it.

I'd guess it does, since you were motivated enough to get into school.<br>  <br>  I notice there's been a lot of dark nasty weather recently where I am.  On that note, I would suggest that you look into the possibility of Seasonally Affected Depression.  This tends to affect people most in the winter time, when it is cold and dark, and can be at least partially treated by bright lights and heaters.<br>  <br>  You're in art school.  Nobody's going to look at you funny if you get brighter lights for drawing, or one of those light box tables for tracing.  heck, it's work related anyway, right? not like you'd be wasting the investment if it didn't do much for the depression, and if it does anything at all for the depression, then that's better than what you've got now, right?
qdw3ZOYFaa	The symptoms you are describing are very close to that of depression.You have to take control in your life...in  a way..so as not to be afraid to talk to your lover. If you love her..and her you...then both of you should stand honest talking between you. Either should not be afraid to say something which may be interpreted (and it is a matter of interpretation) as something sinister. Please ask her to read this as well. If you do feel elated at some stage...and down at others...this is definitely a sign of depression and you really need to seek professional assistance in order to receive treatment. I again urge you to show this response to your lover and this way..she will be in the full picture should you say something you think that you should have not.I think that if she loves you she will understand this post fully|`|d3GUVXjlaa	You may have a strep linked OCD called PANDAS.  Google “Strep and OCD” and you should be able to find out more about it.   This could explain why you had the sudden outbreak of anxiety and OCD symptoms.  It could be puberty or something, but I would suggest going to the doctor to get his/her take.  There is medication for anxiety and OCD as well as depression.   Don’t worry too much about it.

It is just a part of being a teenager.  Your emotional mind is growing way more than the rest of your brain at this time in your life so it is really quite normal to feel things intensely now.  It is something that slacks off after you mature a bit.<br>  <br>  That being said, it probably would be helpful to talk to a therapist regarding your symptoms.  If he or she thinks medication might be helpful, they might refer you to a psychiatrist as well (your medical doctor can also be a good starting person of contact). <br>  <br>  If you begin to have thoughts of hurting yourself, that's another story.

074acd28f86f8dea394606443e6b37d2aa	It's supposed to be a very powerful cleanse and the weight loss is a by product of the cleansing of all the toxins and waste being removed from your body.  Make sure you use organic lemons, distilled water and grade B or C maple syrup as those have a higher mineral content than Grade A- which is where your body gets the vital support it needs. You truly have to be mentally prepared to do this- it is a discipline- but if you are doing it for your health- the discipline will be easier. Also- I have read up on ways to break the fast- your body needs to gently be broken back into regular eating again.   Do an online search for "lemon cleanse" on yahoo- that is where  I read up on it all. :) Best of luck! :)|`|AA12298409	I think it resembles the slim-fast jump start diet where you drink nothing but slim-fast for 5 days then continue to eating one healthy meal a day after that. But as for as health wise I don't think it is a good idea. When you lose weight too quickly it tends to have a larger impact on your body than just losing weight quickly. It can mess up your entire digestive system including metabolism. And losing weight this way we tend to add the pounds back on faster later on.

bppI7Pxzaa	Hello Claire,<br>  Im 14 as well and like you i can only sleep in pitch black but when its dark upstairs i have to turn the light on because i think someone is there.<br>  Sometimes you can overcome a fear by facing a fear.<br>  Here is a bit of information i found for you that might be useful ( <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Im-Scared-Of-The-Dark!--Helping-A-Child-To-Overcome-Night-Fears&id=377358" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Im-Scared-Of-T...</a> )<br>  <br>  It's very common for children to be scared of the dark. They may have always been scared – or they may have no fear for a long time and then suddenly, inexplicably develop one. Child experts believe that some children are just naturally prone to suffering from night fears. Or an experience may have created a new fear which then manifests itself as a sudden fear of the dark.<br>  <br>  Looking For Reasons<br>  <br>  Have there been any changes to the child’s life recently? Any of these events can trigger new fears in a child:<br>  <br>  Death of a member of the family, friend or pet <br>  <br>  New baby in the family <br>  <br>  House move <br>  <br>  New child care provider <br>  <br>  Different pre-school schedule or a change to an existing one <br>  <br>  Change in family status due to redundancy or similar <br>  <br>  Have they been significantly upset by a scary story or TV program or cartoon<br>  <br>  How To Help The Child<br>  <br>  Don’t try to make a joke of the fear. It’s real to the child and that’s what matters. You may think you’re making light of their fear by poking fun at it, dismissing it or teasing them about it – but this is known to be unhelpful. It can make the fear last longer and worse, affect the child’s trust in you.<br>  <br>  However small the child’s fear seems to you, always listen to them with patience and sympathy. Avoid becoming exasperated or annoyed at the child. You are there to be supportive and work towards a solution. Any sign of derision will be counter-productive.<br>  <br>  Give the child something to ‘fight back with’. Create some form of ‘protection’ for them. This could be a superhero toy or special anti-monster potion (water in a simple spray bottle) or a cartoon character flashlight. This will give the child back some of the power that the fear takes away.<br>  <br>  Don’t insist that the child sleeps in the dark. If you were scared of spiders, how would you like to be forced to have a tarantula on your hand?<br>  <br>  Nightlights (timed and continuous) are available. Leave a small bedside light on until you go to bed. Give the child a flashlight to use whenever they want. <br>  The need for light usually only lasts for a short time so allow the child this simple request. Try and play it down so that the child doesn’t become totally dependant on it.<br>  <br>  Try and avoid having the child sleep with you. This is a difficult habit to break so it’s best not to start it. If they come to you, saying they’re scared, simply take them back to bed. Check the room out and reassure them that they are quite safe. <br>  If necessary, stay until the child settles.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry too much about the fear. It is normal and happens to a lot of children. If you deal with it calmly and in a helpful way, it should pass within a few weeks or months.<br>  <br>  <br>  You may also want to visit your doctor who might have some information for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and feel free to email me =)<br>  x|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Honestly, a lot of people don't like the dark.<br>  <br>  I have times where I'm extremely fearful of the dark, then other times I'm fine. Don't know what it is, but it happens. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure that you can necessarily get over the fear, but you can try. Maybe sit in the dark for a little bit with someone you trust. Whether it be a parent, sibling, friend, etc. Just have them sit next to you and try and relax. You can try this method so your brain associates the darkenss with a calm mood, but it may not be effective.<br>  <br>  I've always heard the best way to over come your fear is to face it, so I guess it's worth a shot!<br>  <br>  By the way, often times when I turn off lights, I'll book it out of the room too! And I will stick out my stomach as if I'm trying to get out of reach of someone trying to grab me from behind. I guess I think something will pop out of the darkness and get me! Who knows? We're teenagers! haha.|`|l1nejLh0aa	Do you watch horror films, suspense thrillers or psychological thrillers?<br>  <br>  Maybe you're scared that there is something watching you as you're walking in the dark? <br>  <br>  If you do watch these type of movies after dark, I suggest you stop, try watching comedy or something cheerful.<br>  <br>  Try telling yourself...<br>  <br>  "There is nothing down there, there is nothing here" <br>  <br>  Or something along those lines. ;)<br>  <br>  Many people are scared of the dark, so you're not alone.<br>  Just remember that there's nothing there, maybe some rats in the basement, but seriously, there should be nothing at all.|`|u1OJ8faAaa	Aww that's so cute but when it';s dark there's nobody there but you so you're just scared of the sounds of your footsteps or the unknown..it's normal...at a time we all get a Lil spooked at the dark because we don't know whats in there. it's a normal human safety innate instinct as old as the humans ourselves..|`|1dM04rNraa	why dont u get get killed for no apparent reason,

W0hNoMSsaa	Levothyroxine does not usually cause weight gain. It might actually cause weight loss if you were overweight because of your sluggish thyroid.  You would also lose weight if your dosage was too high.<br>  <br>  It could work the other way. If your hypothyroidism symptoms made you lose weight due to lack of appetite, then after treatment you would get your appetite back and return to your normal weight.<br>    <br>  You should start feeling better after two or three days on the hormone, but it takes several weeks to get the full benefit.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, levothyroxine itself can actually cause weight loss or increased appetite, so its kinda hit and miss as to which, if either will happen as a side effect of the drug.  You may have an easier time losing weight though, because one of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is increased weight gain, so by treating that you should naturally lose weight.

TiUfiuEoaa	It is important to keep spot-prone areas clean, so wash the affected area twice a day with a perfume-free cleanser. Do bear in mind that the skin needs a certain amount of oil to maintain its natural condition. Therefore, avoid washing your face many times, that too, with a strong soap. I would recommend Cetaphil and Neutrogena face washes as they are mild and good for cleaning acne-affected skin.<br>  Tea tree oil is considered to be a good anti-acne agent. Sandalwood paste and Fuller’s earth (multani mitti) are also used by some to dry out the excessive oil.

However, not everyone gets acne, and that sucks because you feel like your the only one. The best treatment (and it really worked for me.. My skin is clear now).. is Retin-A. It is expensive about $100... but if you have insurance it should be cheap $20 ... ask your doctor to try it.. see if you can get the generic form Tretinoin $10...which does an awesome job too. if you live near Mexico  it is really cheap there. Also wash your face with Aveeno Oatmeal Moisturizer bar regularly... $3 or so at target. and use a little lotion (the kind that does not clog pores..) to keep your skin from drying out.|`|pBhbQiMtaa	All of these answers sound good. But having acne for the better part of my life made me realize that you have to find what works for you. Things work on people different ways. Take proactiv for example. It worked for those people that had testimonials but it didn't work for me. I tried it for a year and progress at first but other treatments worked better.. So my advice to you is to use trial and error. I would say try a product out for at least 3 months or longer to give it time to work and see if you have made any progress. If not then try another. Hope that helps
vPI1hVGUaa	Glamour magick, also referred to as Glamoury is a form of magick used to boost the "allure" of a person. From changing your makeup to changing your eye and hair color. Glamoury means “to enchant with the eyes.” It was one of the powers often ascribed to medieval witches.<br>  <br>  Eye Color Spell<br>  One or more candle(s) of the color you want your eyes to be<br>  Light the candle(s) and sit in front of it.<br>  Clear your mind and chant three or more times<br>  "1 2 3 change for me, 1 2 3 (current color)<br>  to (color you want your eyes to be)"<br>  Once again, clear your mind and chant three or more times<br>  "By the power of three, Let it be seen"<br>  <br>  Dark grey/blue eyes are very beautiful and you can basically wear any shade of makeup to enchance them. <br>  <br>  I would suggest trying different shades of eyeshadows or eyeliners. Applying an eyeliner helps you emphasize and enhance the natural beauty of your eyes. You have the pencil type, the liquid liner, the cake eyeliner and those with a felt tip.<br>  <br>  Bring out the blue tones in gray eyes with light to medium shades of blue eye shadow for day. Then go darker and bolder at night or add a touch of glitter or gleam like the jewel lapis lazuli. Try lining the eye with navy or midnight blue liner.<br>  <br>  Bring out the green tones in gray eyes with green shadow choices following the same vibrancy rules. Line the eye in a soft grass green for day and a deep forest green for night.

2sycPf8Daa	The basic aspects of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.<br>  <br>  The initial lesion in atherosclerosis involves the intima(the inner layer of blood vessel,) of the artery and begins in childhood with the development of fatty streaks. The advanced lesions of atherosclerosis occur with increasing frequency with aging. The clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis are well known and include coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Forms of accelerated arteriopathies, such as restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting and coronary transplant vasculopathy differ in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.<br>  <br>  Early arterial accumulation of cholesterol causes a reduction in arterial distensibility (the capability of being distended or stretched under pressure.) which occurs before other vessel wall changes become apparent; the loss of distensibility, which increases with age, is related to development of atherosclerosis loss of vessel distensibility also occurs with accumulation of cholesterol in the vessel wall, even in young people.<br>  <br>  The first phase in atherosclerosis histologically presents as focal thickening of the intimae with an increase in smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix.These smooth muscle cells, which are possibly derived from hematopoietic stem cells migrate and proliferate within the intima. This is followed by accumulation of intracellular lipid deposits or extracellular lipids or both, which produce the fatty streak. Biglycan, a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, can be detected in the intima of atherosclerotic coronary artery segments; it can bind and trap lipoproteins, including apolipoprotein E, VLDL remnants, LDL, and HDL. The fatty streak also consists of macrophages with a variable number of T lymphocytes.<br>  <br>  As these lesions expand, more smooth muscle cells migrate into the intima. The smooth muscle cells within the deep layer of the fatty streak are susceptible to apoptosis which is associated with further macrophage infiltration and cytoplasmic remnants that can calcify, perhaps contributing to the transition of fatty streaks into atherosclerotic plaques.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|ZjhQ6PL8aa	Atherosclerosis develops from low-density lipoprotein molecules (LDL) becoming oxidized (ldl-ox) by free radicals, particularly oxygen free radicals (ROS). Blood in arteries contains plenty of oxygen and is where atherosclerosis develops. Blood in veins contains little oxygen where atherosclerosis rarely develops. When oxidized LDL comes in contact with an artery wall, a series of reactions occurs to repair the damage to the artery wall caused by oxidized LDL. The LDL molecule is globular shaped with a hollow core for carrying cholesterol throughout the body for making brain tissue, vitamin D, etc. Cholesterol does not dissolve in water. Blood is 70% water. The only way cholesterol can move in the bloodstream is to be carried by LDL.<br>  <br>  The body's immune system responds to the damage to the artery wall caused by oxidized LDL by sending specialized white blood cells (macrophages and T-lymphocytes) to absorb the oxidized-LDL. Unfortunately, these white blood cells are not able to process the oxidized-LDL, and ultimately grow then rupture, depositing a greater amount of oxidized cholesterol into the artery wall. This triggers more white blood cells, continuing the cycle.<br>  <br>  Eventually, the artery becomes inflamed. The cholesterol plaque causes the muscle cells to enlarge and form a hard cover over the affected area. This hard cover is what causes a narrowing of the artery, reduces the blood flow and increases blood pressure.<br>  <br>  Some researchers believe that atherosclerosis may be caused by an infection of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Chickens, for example, develop atherosclerosis when infected with the Marek's disease herpesvirus.[2] Herpesvirus infection of arterial smooth muscle cells has been shown to cause cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation.[3] Cholesteryl ester accumulation is associated with atherosclerosis.<br>  <br>  Courtesy of wiki.

You've tried dieting, keeping a food diary, creating an exercise regimen, and perhaps even hypnosis. It's now obvious that the problem isn't with the technique, but with your willpower. Old habits die hard. If you're having a hard time maintaining your efforts over time, here are some radical ways to break away from the routine.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hide these ads<br>  <br>  Show Ads <br>  [edit] StepsFocus on the tried and true. Ultimately, losing weight comes down to one key principle: Burn more calories than you consume. The steps that follow won't work if you have a thousand more calories coming into your body on a daily basis than you have going out. Lay the foundation for weight loss with these practices:<br>  <br>  <br>  Count calories and keep a food diary. <br>  Go on a diet. <br>  Cut down on sugar, high fructose corn syrup, trans fats and saturated fats. <br>  Burn more calories by exercising: Run, walk, even exercise at the computer you are sitting in front of now. <br>  Raise your metabolism. <br>   <br>  Big bowl, big servings, big weight gainDownsize your kitchenware. The human mind works in mysterious ways. It turns out that using smaller bowls, plates, and containers can subconsciously influence how much you serve yourself. Even nutrition experts are victims of this phenomenon; when 85 of them were given a random mix of small and large bowls and scoops, those who got larger bowls served themselves 31% more ice cream, and added on another 14.5% if they had bigger scoops![1] <br>   <br>  Put down the knife. By putting down whatever utensils you're using between every bite, you can significantly slow down your eating time, leaving your stomach a chance to feel full and reducing the likelihood that you'll go for seconds. Another technique that can have a similar effect is to take a sip between each bite. Numerous studies have shown that eating slowly results in eating less.[2] There's even a device you can get from a dentist that you wear to make your oral cavity smaller so that you take smaller bites,[3] and a fork that's so awkward to use that you'll get less food per bite![4] <br>   <br>  Know the enemy Make a list of the food items that are your weaknesses. These aren't always unhealthy foods, either. Sometimes we fool ourselves into believing that as long as we avoid the "bad" foods, we're making progress. At least, that's what we like to think as we get up for our third serving of fruit salad, or finish a bag of pretzels in one sitting, saying that they're healthier than chips. Remember that too much of anything is bad. You probably don't need to keep a food diary to know your enemies. Common culprits include soda, bread, alcohol, and fast food. Whatever your weakness is, cut down on it. If you cut it out completely, you're more likely to binge. Buy only small packages of it and have it only once in a while. If cutting down doesn't work, you might need to go cold turkey. <br>   <br>  Whole grain pastaChoose whole grains over a whole belly. If you switch out all of your refined grain food (white bread, food made with white flour) for whole-grain food (oatmeal, whole-grain cereal, whole-grain pasta, brown rice and barley) you won't lose additional weight overall. However, you will lose more weight in the belly area, which will make you look thinner--at least, that's what a Penn State study implies.[5] Not only will your slimmer profile make you feel better about your progress, but by losing the VAT (visceral adipose tissue) you're also doing away with a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, coronary vascular disease, and some types of cancer.[6] Check those labels and make sure that any grain-based foods you buy are made up of at least fifty-one percent whole grain.[5] <br>   <br>  Limit your spending. Some people have an easier time controlling their wallet than controlling their diet. Go ahead, cut up those credit cards, and build up your emergency fund, if you haven't already (in its own account, and leave the bank card at home). Limit the amount of cash you have in your wallet, especially if you're subject to spontaneous fast food indulgences. When you go grocery shopping, have a list prepared, and bring just enough money to cover those items (this might take a few dry runs). The embarrassment of not having enough money at the register will keep you from throwing a few extra items in the shopping cart. If you don't do the grocery shopping, then offer to take on this monumental role. Your family or roommates might complain about the absence of junk food, but you'll be doing them a favor by stocking the kitchen with healthy stuff. They'll thank you...later...years later. <br>   <br>  Set a digital watch to go off every two hours. Eat only when the watch tells you to. Spontaneous eating sessions (those times when you feel those hunger pangs, those cravings, and you scour the cabinets or the streets in search of satisfaction) are your weakest points. This is why all weight loss books tell you to avoid skip

You are growing up and you shouldn't be thinking about losing weight. Your body is still changing, so weight gain is perfectly normal. If you do lose weight to become 115 pounds, you will be on the low side. That's not healthy for someone your age. I think you should accept your body the way it is right now.

Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time.

A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand. <br>  <br>  For you, or others: A massage (at least neck and shoulders) with jasmine, lavender, juniper, and/or bergamot, or German chamomile essential oils added to the massage oil, and to a warm bath, preferably beforehand, to help make any tension knots and muscles more pliant (they may only want, say, a sandalwood & juniper, or bergamot mix:; check first). I am aware of advice that strong heat, applied to essential oils can damage them, and so I would not use a diffuser. Also consider anise, basil, bay, eucalyptus, peppermint, rose, or thyme. Place some pieces of rock salt in a small vial, then add a few drops of the oil of your choice (the rock salt absorbs the oil and is less risky to carry around than a bottle of oil). Open the vial and breathe in the scent whenever you need a quick stress release.

HxXduL1maa	An ear infection means that the middle ear is infected. The middle ear is the eardrum and the small space behind the eardrum. An ear infection is sometimes called 'acute otitis media'. A separate leaflet deals with infection of the ear canal (otitis externa).<br>  The small space behind the eardrum in the middle ear is normally filled with air. It is connected to the back of the throat by a tiny channel called the Eustachian tube.<br>  <br>  The middle ear space sometimes becomes filled with mucus (fluid), often during a cold. The mucus may then become infected by bacteria or viruses. people with glue ear who have mucus behind their eardrum are more prone to ear infections. Sometimes an ear infection occurs 'out of the blue' for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  Most bouts of ear infection will clear on their own without treatment within 2-3 days. The immune system can usually clear bacteria or viruses that cause ear infections. However, treatments that may be advised include the following:<br>  <br>  <br>  If the ear infection is causing pain then give painkillers regularly until the pain eases. For example, paracetamol (Calpol, Disprol, etc) or ibuprofen. These drugs will also lower a raised temperature which can make a child feel better. If antibiotics are prescribed (see below), you should still give the painkiller as well until the pain eases.<br>  <br>  A recent research study found that a few drops of a local anaesthetic drug (lignocaine) placed into the ear may help to ease pain. Further studies are needed to clarify the use of this treatment. However, it seems logical, and may become more widely used over time, especially in children with severe ear pain.<br>  <br>  <br>  Antibiotics are not advised in most cases. This is because in most cases the infection clears within 2-3 days on its own. Also, it is best not to take antibiotics unless needed, as side-effects such as diarrhoea or rash can sometimes be a problem. Antibiotics are more likely to be prescribed if:<br>  <br>  <br>  When an ear infection first develops it is common for a doctor to advise a 'wait and see' approach for 2-3 days. This means just using painkillers to ease the pain, and to see if the infection clears. In most cases, the infection clears. However, if it does not then following a review by a doctor an antibiotic may then be advised. Sometimes, it may be difficult to see a doctor again in 2-3 days if things do not improve - for example, over a weekend. In this situation a doctor may issue a prescription for an antibiotic with the advice to only use the prescription to get the antibiotic if the condition does not improve within 2-3 days.|`|osoTq2dcaa	ear infections hurt ... i use to get them surfing ... so im assuming cold weather can do that ... have it checked out they give you drops for it|`|AA10426129	Infection can affect the ear canal (otitis externa), the eardrum, or the middle ear (otitis media). Most ear injuries are caused by pressure changes during direct injury (such as a blow to the ear) or sport scuba diving, but, a persistently painful ear may signal an infection that requires treatment. Because an ear scope (otoscope) may not be available to examine the canal and inner ear in remote locations, starting therapy may be appropriate until a doctor can be reached.|`|HJXezEuLaa	Okay, I just had my first one two weeks ago-And it didn't feel like that, though my one was a outer ear infection, which is better then the inner ear infection.

Yes cold sores are contagious and if you never had them and now you are getting them since you've kissed her probably means have have contacted that strain of herpes. You can not get rid of that and it comes when it pleases. Don't worry though everyone has had herpes one time in their life at least. For example the chicken pox is a kind of herpes.

9alw0BY7aa	.Wow! This is a new one for me,  It just goes to show you that people can sell anything and there's always a sucker to buy it. <br>  <br>  Let me explain why I have a problem with just putting these elastics on the teeth to close the gap. Teeth are angled in the bone, each tooth has its own angle in order to fit properly. Braces have these measurements built into them so that the teeth will maintain the proper arch form and angulation. When we close a gap with elastic chain, we are moving the teeth sideways, while maintaining proper position. Also, when you put pressure on just the front two teeth with these teeth effect bands, you aren't moving the laterals, so a gap will open there. There is absolutely no control of any other teeth. So now you will have 2 gaps, and possible rotations or tipping of the central incisors!<br>  <br>  PS There is nothing to hold the teeth closed once you supposedly close the gap, so it will reopen when you stop using these elastics. And there is absolutely no scientific literature backing up this product. <br>  <br>  This is an unbelievably bad product! I can't believe it's on the market.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	what kind of music they play?
SZdVYrSSaa	This is dependent on many things.<br>  <br>  In the United States, the medical boards report the average size of a white American citizen's penis to be 6.3 inches in length. However, in, Japan, for instance, the national Japanese health bureau puts the national average closer to 4.1 inches, and in Egypt, the national average is close to 8 inches. <br>  <br>  Most doctors will agree that age, family history, ethnic ancestral background, and even your mother's blood circulation during pregnancy can all effect the size of a guy's penis. It may continue growing until you are in your thirties, it may stop growing when you are sixteen, there are even cases where the male penis will loose or gain an inch in size after the age of sixty.<br>  <br>  In any case, there is still no effective way to change size, so worrying about if it fits an average is only going to wind up being a loss of time and energy. Learn to own your package no matter how small or large it is, and find someone you care for who thinks it is perfect for them. I actually like guys a little smaller than average when I am with a man, it's cute, and yet, I, at just under 8.1 inches in length find that there are people who are entirely infatuated with larger sizes.<br>  <br>  It's all up to personal opinion.<br>  <br>  There is no average body, only a confident one, and a nervous one.

There are alot of details that you did not give and I cannot say if you were right or wrong to take her home. If you wanted her at home I hope you discussed this with her doctor because chances are if you didn't he may wash his hands of the whole affair and you may be looking for a new doctor at this stage in the game. Don't try to do it on your own. No matter how much family is involved it is going to be a very emotional roller coaster as she gets sicker and she will get very sick. Cancer is a horrible disease that no one should have to bear. At this point just be there for her. The main goal is comfort.

My Dad and I took care of her with help from hospice.  The would come a couple of times a week, but more frequently as the end got near.  <br>  <br>  Hon, if  your Mom wants to be home and you and your family can take care of her, have her home.  She'll be more comfortable there than at the hospital and her family surrounding her at all times will help lift her spirits.  I think you did the right thing.<br>  <br>  If things progress and her pain is overwhelming to her, you may have to take her back to the hospital though.  The hospital and hospice here taught my Dad and I how to take care of the machines and the IV's that my Mom needed when she got home.  <br>  <br>  My heart goes out to you and your family.  You take care and be strong for your Mom.|`|w8i9bF72aa	being terminal,  you did what you felt was best for your mother. Either way the outcome will be the same.

However often times the precursor to cervical cancer is HPV (Human Papillomavirus) which is an STD.  I would say you're ok, but get checked out to be sure.  And always use a condom.|`|a1c9da4a2a6e971f43d988078b7d0b67aa	You have low risk. The more sexual partners you have, the more your risk increases, also if your partner has had a large number of sexual partners this can increase the risk as men can be carriers of HPV which causes cervical cancer. But in your case I would not be worried as the figures you give are nothing to worry about. The only other consideration is if there is significant family history.<br>  <br>  But there is no harm in having a repeat test, if nothing else it might reasure you if you are anxious.|`|AA12266052	Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma that is caused by human papillomavirus infection or an adenocarcinoma. Early cancer is asymptomatic; the 1st symptom of later cancer is usually postcoital vaginal bleeding. Diagnosis is by screening cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) test and biopsy. Staging is clinical. Treatment usually includes surgical resection, radiation therapy, and, unless cancer is localized, chemotherapy; if cancer is widely metastasized, treatment is primarily chemotherapy.(Merck)<br>  Please look out the following symptoms of cervical cancer: <br>  Most ot the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur can include:<br>      * Continuous vaginal discharge, which may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling<br>      * Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause<br>      * Periods become heavier and last longer than usual<br>      * Any bleeding after menopause<br>  Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include:<br>      * Loss of appetite<br>      * Weight loss<br>      * Fatigue<br>      * Pelvic pain<br>      * Back pain<br>      * Leg pain<br>      * Single swollen leg<br>      * Heavy bleeding from the vagina<br>      * Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina<br>      * Bone fractures<br>  Exams and Tests for cervical cancer:<br>  Pre-cancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer can not be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions.<br>  Pap smears screen for pre-cancers and cancer, but do not offer the final diagnosis. If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are surgically removed (biopsied) during this procedure and sent to a laboratory for examination.  <br>  Other tests may include:<br>      * Endocervical curettage (ECC) to examine the opening of the cervix<br>      * Cone biopsy<br>  If the woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer, the health care provider will order more tests to determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include:<br>      * CT scan<br>      * Cystoscopy<br>      * MRI<br>      * Chest x-ray<br>      * Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)<br>  (MedlinePlus)|`|XOlnc8iBaa	I had cervical cancer age 29 and ten years to live.

0nyWiro9aa	One has to back up some with the clinical indications for testing in the first place. If hepatitis testing were done due to an elevated liver enzyme indicating hepatitis then characterizing the type of hepatitis would be in order. One can do a hepatitis panel that can detect viral antigens and viral antibodies that are present in viral hepatitis. One of those test is the viral antibody HCV. Usually such a test is an ELISA test or EIA which can have false positives. A RIBA test can be used to confirm positive EIA testing which is common place in blood bank centers. This simply confirms the presence of antibody and not necessarily the presence of the virus. It is possible to have had hepatitis C and have it resolve itself and go away. Unfortunately the odds are predominantly in favor of chronic hepatitis rather than a natural resolution of hepatitis when it comes to hepatitis C. The antibody only proves one was exposed and not if one has active hepatitis.  The initial test denoting the presence of hepatitis is important ie elevated ALT liver enzyme. <br>  A positive antibody warrants the next step which is a test for nucleic acids (NAT) for hepatitis C. If it is positive then that proves that the virus is present and is still active. The viral load is a test that determines how much virus is present. Another test that is done after the presence of viral particles are confirmed is a genotyping of hepatitis C. Certain genotypes are more amenable to interferon treatments.<br>  <br>  So without knowing which test were done then the general sequence would be above. Good luck|`|AA10213842	it sounds like to me he had a standard liver panel done. this is a routine test to see how well the liver is functioning. what they probably saw was his alt and ast levels were luckily elevated- i say luckily because many who undergo this general test often have normal enzymes and it leads to the doctor thinkning everything is okay. the person is sent home with the ideal that everything is okay- when in reality, many still have hcv and don't know it until it's too late to do much about it.<br>  <br>  so, please be thankful! this indication could be a life saver!<br>  <br>  now, try not to worry. he will probably have an antibody test at his next visit. this is to see if he carries the markers for hcv. if those markers come back positive, then they will do a pcr test to determine if the disease (HCV) is chronic active. <br>  <br>  if he is positive, try not to worry. i know it's easier said than done, but hcv is NOT a true STD because there ALWAYS has to be blood to bloodstream involvement for hcv to be acquired. HCV corpuscles found in all bodily fluids except that of blood are NOT CONTAGIOUS.<br>  <br>  In the meantime however, do not share sharps, ie, razors, toothbrushes.  <br>  <br>  Keep in touch! I like to know how my "questioners" are doing!!!!<br>  <br>  ((HUGS)) and thanks for being supportive of your husband by asking questions about HCV!!!|`|HoeWeCGAaa	If he has done any of these then he may be in trouble.dont get too stressed out,i thought i had HPV,turned out it was jock itch.lol<br>  <br>  <br>  stay strong.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What causes hepatitis C infection?<br>  <br>  Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus. It is spread by contact with an infected person's blood.<br>  <br>  You can get hepatitis C if:<br>  <br>      * You share needles and other equipment used to inject illegal drugs. This is the most common way to get hepatitis C in the United States.<br>      * You had a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992. As of 1992 in the United States, all donated blood and organs are screened for hepatitis C.<br>      * You get a shot with a needle that has infected blood on it. This happens in some developing countries where they use needles more than once when giving shots.<br>      * You get a tattoo or a piercing with a needle that has infected blood on it. This can happen if equipment isn't cleaned properly after it is used.<br>  <br>  In rare cases, a mother with hepatitis C spreads the virus to her baby at birth, or a health care worker is accidentally exposed to blood that is infected with hepatitis C.<br>  <br>  Experts are not sure if you can get hepatitis C through sexual contact. If there is a risk of getting the virus through sexual contact, it is very small.<br>  <br>  You cannot get hepatitis C from casual contact such as hugging, kissing, sneezing, coughing, or sharing food or drink.

AD/HD, which was called ADD until over a decade ago, is a disorder that must be diagnosed using the criteria in the DSM-IV TR.

It doesnt matter how you look, or how much muscle you have. It's really all about confidence, be yourself around everyone and you'll put out this positive vibe that everyone will love. The women love it when a man is confident and knows what he's doing. Don't listen to all those magazines and media, only the really materialistic women care about how you look and how much money you have, you can still find beautiful women as long as you get out there and show them all you have confidence.

Like everyone else has said it is about confidence. in fact there was a survey done about a year ago that stated 86% of woman surveyed would rather have a man that wasn't in tip top shape.

For that you would need an expectorant, like the one found in Mucinex and Robitussin.  The active ingredient in that is called guaifenesin.  Both Mucinex and Robitussin are available in formulas without a decongestant, but I'd check with the pharmacist to make sure you are choosing the right one, and that it won't have side effects like decongestants.|`|IvoaNyN2aa	CAN YOU TOLERATE VITAMIN C? tHE TIME RELEASE IS GOOD AND THIS IS NATURAL..IT GOES IN AND DRIES UP EVRYTHING...YOU TAKE 1,000 MG AN HOUR..OF THE GOOD STUFF LIKE WHOLE FOODS...IF YOU GET DIARREA, THE DOSE IS TOO HIGH<br>  <br>  YOU ALSO NEED TO BLOW YOUR NOSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO CLEAR OUT THE PHLEM AS THIS MAKES YOU COUGH<br>  <br>  USE HERBS THAT ARE DRYING, (OR HEAT) SUCH AS HOT TEAS, CINNAMON, GINGER ROOT, AND AND THINGS FIERY SUCH AS PEPPERS,  GARLIC, ONIONS,  ETC<br>  <br>  STAY AWAY FROM MILK CHEESE , YOGURT, AND ANYTHING THAT CAUSES PHLEGM
6d0ce236c26e437069d6dbfccb6a0592aa	This only is an issue for people undergoing three day a week dialysis - the standard treatment modality in the US. People who dialyze more frequently at home or who choose peritoneal dialysis have fewer unpleasent side effects.<br>  <br>  Even those on three day a week dialysis can lessen the effects of dialysis by carefully controling the amount of fluid they drink between treatments. Dialysis replaces in three to four hours the work healthy kidneys do 24 hours a day 7 days a week. When a large amount of fluid is removed (large being over 3 KG for many people) during a dialysis treatment it can cause cramping, feelings of nausia and pounding headaches.<br>  <br>  The best way to lessen the negative impact of dialysis is to dialyze longer and/or more frequently - so the fluid changes aren't so sudden. If changing the schedule is not option then it is very important to follow the dietary and fluid restrictions suggested by the dialysis unit. Strictly control salt intake, this will make controling fluid consumption easier, which will then make dialysis easier on the body.|`|a6c57d05d66e05fbade73a67f2ab85d9aa	Large amounts of blood are pumped out of your body to be "cleaned" in a machine, since your kidney's can not filter and remove toxins any longer. After it is cleaned it is pumped back into your body through a fistula in your arm that allows the large amounts of blood to pump in and out without causing the vein or artery to collaspe on their own. If you've ever donated blood you would know how it feels to lose one pint of your blood in about 15 minutes. Several pints of blood are passed in and out of the body in 2 to 3 hours, several times a week. It is very hard for someone on dialysis to go through it. They need tons of support from their family and medical team.  If you have any more questions just search for "Kidney Dialysis" and you'll get tons of websites to look at. Hope this helps, good luck and God bless!

You need to do situps for 5 minutes every other day.  And here is why they are so hard to get, people give up.  It takes 6 months to get them, but when you do, boy do they look nice.  Good luck.  Also try running that hellps too.|`|26153438107c6382c80125fe66214563aa	run, its the key.  Stay healthy, don't do too many situps and crunches unless you are doing things that work your back.

Yes Klonopin is a depressent because relaxes you and gives you a sedative effect.  Depression is a downer as well.  If I were you I would tell your therapist that you are struggling with depression as well.  Medication is something I never recommend to my friends because I believe there are other underlying issues.  You should be consulting a doctor on these issues and not with people you barely know.|`|8c0b7ed60a19a3c1e7d820e5d20a33abaa	I think so;but thats just a personal opion.To me klonopin does the same thing as valium, and Xanax,and they all seem to mellow you out to the point,of feeling down;and depressed.|`|d63b7585d97a1ced3bdf830dfbfed8f2aa	Yes, and actually one of the possible side effects listed is depression:<br>  <br>  What are the possible side effects of Klonopin (clonazepam) ?

ntPvdl1paa	OK, so I'll be completely serious, and no BS here:  pizza, in moderation, is fine, but if you're really taking in some hefty amounts of it and doing so consistently and persistently, it can lead to health issues.  The primary issue with pizza is it's made with refined white carbohydrates. I want to explain what effect that has on the human body.  When you eat pizza, it causes insulin levels to rise rapidly in the body. Insulin is a storage hormone, it's the thing which transports nutrients to your cells. It also works to lower the amount of glucose in your blood. Foods like pizza are rapidly converted by your body into glucose. High levels of glucose in your blood, which can be caused by eating high glycemic foods like pizza, is a bad thing.  The problem with these insulin spikes is that for some people, it can lead to problems such as type 2 diabetes down the line, which is a condition where your body doesn't properly manage insulin due to those wild spikes throwing everything out of whack. I'm not saying this is the only cause for type 2 diabetes, but it's certainly one of the prime candidates.|`|AA12213723	well your missing your most important meal of the day, your breakfast should give you the energy to-keep going all day,i guess pizza's not that bad,but you should be eating fruits and veggies and your grains to, if your healthy now and you continue like this you won't stay healthy.how come you don't eat healthy?your going to get fat, and have other problems if you don't start treating your body right.so you've been told, go see a dietitian and doctor|`|1c797c6bac7890b85791e54dded18789aa	Well, if your diet isn't particularly varied, you're probably not getting some important nutrients. For example, unless you've got lots of veggies on that pizza, you might not be getting enough vitamin C, which can lead to scurvy. Additionally, pizza has a lot of fat, which can cause quite a few health problems - elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, weight gain, among others.|`|6B0K5Lo6aa	As a fellow lover of pizza, I have to tell you honestly, that you don't have a very good diet here.  First, you should always eat breakfast - it is the most important meal of the day.  Second, you need fruits and vegetables and some variety in your diet.  There has to be balance.  Pizza is great for a once a week thing, but not every single day.|`|AA11274334	well it would be better for you to eat breakfeast,or at least drink a glass of milk.and take a multivitamin.pizza is good for you sortof but not all the time like you have been eating.it may not cause health problems right now but it may in the future.eat more vegetables,fruit,and try to eat some meat,or sausage pizza.|`|AA11626547	Well it is not the healthiest of meals, but you are getting vegetables - tomato, carbs - the crust and protein - cheese.<br>  <br>  But you really need to get some variety in your diet, how about starting out with a bowl of cereal for breakfast - oatmeal is great, and a piece of fruit.<br>  <br>  For lunch, have a big salad with your pizza. make sure it is healthy, avoid adding in high fat things.<br>  <br>  For dinner - try to eat something healthier - more variety twice a week, add some potato, rice or pasta,  more veggies and some chicken or fish.<br>  <br>  Keep adding in more healthy stuff and start to phase out the pizza. <br>  <br>  We don't want to read your obituary.|`|8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	well it's not bad to eat pizza but just pizza is bad! eat healthy food. once in a while eat pizza. eating pizza only gets u overweighted and lowers your bp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i19A9jcVaa	As a dental tech, I can tell you that it is always a good idea to get in ASAP, good job on that.<br>  <br>  What happens is when Temps are put on, your teeth are prepped for a permanent crown, This entails grinding down a LARGE majority of the tooth, leaving it open and exposed. Without that temporary crown you are more prone to have decay get into the site, cause an infection and lose a tooth. It is an extreme scenario, but it has happened. Temporaries fall off ALL the time. They are only temporary.. They have to be made to easily separate when the final comes in, without leaving a huge hassle and mess to clean up after. They are nothing more than acrylic and glued on. The cement is not permanent, so this can happen OFTEN.<br>  <br>  I am glad you are going in to get it fixed, I have seen cases of infection, more decay, etc. And some extreme cases of having to be extracted.Once you lose one tooth it is like a domino effect as the bone underneath starts to recede. A never ending battle. Good luck and take care!|`|hnNjxFjbaa	If you take it off, then your teeth will shift and close up some of the room. Making it harder for your dentist to put in the permanants. I had 4 temps in and 1 fell off and I ignored it. It took a long while before that permant can go in. Sometimes they just fall out, happens sometimes, but going in and them putting it back on takes less than 5 mins. Very fast.|`|73a7e13b9a45d238f64474d9bf88bef5aa	I once had a permanent crown and it came off when I was eating a now and later.

Vio el resultado de mi estudio de papanicolaou y dijo que todo estaba bien y me explicó que todas las mujeres somos diferentes, algunas tenemos mas secrecion que otras, pero si tus estudios no arrojan ninguna irregularidad, no hay problema. Hasta el sol de hoy estoy perfecta de salud. Por cierto, esa secrecion de flujo blanco, era solamente interna, es decir, nunca salia, mi ropa interior quedaba sin mancha alguna.

6d0ce236c26e437069d6dbfccb6a0592aa	It would help if you clarified your question but what came to my mind was the tubing used for peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is a type of dialysis that uses the peritoneum as the semipermeable membrane. The peritoneum is the membrane that surrounds the human gut – stomach, intestines, liver, etc – dialysis is accomplished by filling the space around those organs with dialysate so that waste solutes can dialyze from the blood into the dialysate.<br>  <br>  In order to fill and empty the dialysate from the gut you need to have a tube placed by a surgeon – a peritoneal catheter. From the outside that peritoneal catheter looks like a plastic tube sticking out of the belly, its purpose is to allow dialysis.|`|12272f49d6c0da0443855ea3602a455caa	?<br>  <br>  Ok, its for people with kidney failure to hook them up to dialysis machines which filter blood for impurities. That's pretty generic, but its correct.|`|AA10234018	With dialysis you create a blood loop by sticking two needles in the patient (or use two central catheter lumen).  The blood goes out of the patient through one needle, THROUGH A SERIES OF TUBING, through the dialyzer (artificial kidney filter), and then through MORE TUBING, and back through the second needle to complete the loop.

mwJD7Q7Daa	El tratamiento del dolor es probablemente el área donde la acupuntura tiene mayor aplicación. El problema es que al basarse en el efecto placebo depende del paciente el efecto que el tratamiento tendrá. <br>  <br>  Es decir, si el acupunturista se gana la confianza del paciente y éste cree firmemente que el dolor disminuirá o desaparecerá pues así será. Sin embargo si el paciente no cree que obtendrá algún beneficio o desconfía del acupunturista entonces no va a obtener ningún beneficio, e incluso en un porcentaje de los casos va a sentirse peor (un efecto placebo negativo, llamado efecto nocevo). <br>  <br>  Entonces al final de cuentas es tu propia actitud la que va a determinar la utilidad del tratamiento.|`|jm6bt1slaa	Claro no te hace mal...como medicina alternativa si funciona....|`|JhQzpa3Faa	Acabo de empezar a usar acupuntura para un problema de disco semi herniado en la columna y francamente las 2 veces que he ido despues del tratamiento noto menos dolor. <br>  <br>  Ojo eso no cura el mal, solo lo alivia y lo hace llevadero, he leido muy buenos comentarios al respecto, lo mas dificil es encontrar un acupunturista calificado, cuando encuentre uno asegurese tambien que el o ella usan agujas nuevas y desechables.

AA11881966	Cycling is a good way to warm( also do rowing if you are warming up for arms shoulders or chest) up but if you want to burn some off fat the bets thing to do is jogging, treadmill is also good if you want to finish your workout by the gym but it is 25% essayer than the real thing. Devote 1 day per week to do just cardio start with jogging for +/- 5 miles or 30 min and then cycle for 30 min if you can do 15 min of rowing too(recommended)<br>  About your weights you sound like a strong guy!! Can I suggest a change in your normal routine Every week change your wait example: instead of doing 4 sets with 10 reps at 30lb, do 3 sets of 8 reps with 35lb. The next week do say 4 sets of 15 reps <br>  with 20lb. Do this with all your weightlifting it is provan to give you more muscle build than doing the same thing over because your muscle get used to routine and start to grow slower. Also look at your diet don't eat big parsons of food rather ear more smaller parsons. And spice up with chilly!!! it kicks up your hart rate that can increase your metabolism by 50% for up to 3 ours.<br>  Hope this will help.<br>  Good luck|`|f938ef85203ad54da65b73e5c9e1b994aa	Hmmmm, its ok.|`|18f29ce0c3d8899fab34719616928ca9aa	CRUNCHES

d819fb289e3d7d90e18a2d7fa1d5c70caa	The reason you cannot find anything is because after experimenting with it in the last decade it was found to not be effective.  It is really a form of self-hypnosis using taped material that either subliminally or through relaxation induction suggests certain criteria or information to the person.  <br>  <br>  At one time it was thought that if you used such techniques during the early sleep stages you could even learn another language.  This has no proven to be true.<br>  <br>  Its often found with "stop smoking" or other self-help topics.  You might find some material there.  However, be aware that its really just another form of "placebo" effect treatment...if you want it to work and believe it will work, it likely will be successful at least in the short term.<br>  <br>  Dusty|`|w07AUmeBaa	Ok - part of the reason you probably can't find anything is that it forms parts of other therapies and is not in its own right "a therapy"<br>  <br>  Modern equivalents include Neuro Linguistic Programming (commonly known as NLP) and others.  If you are interested in this maybe consider getting books out on this and also 'Psycho-Cybernetics' <br>  <br>  Some of this also forms many other therapies... and forms the basis of a lot of Anthony Robbins and other motivational speakers material.<br>  <br>  Autosuggestive is a very broad term nowadays and forms the foundation of lots of specific therapies.

The problem didn't start until I got about 25 years old.  Unfortunately, it gets worse as you grow older.

You might have to see a doctor and get some kind of prescription for sleeping pills.  I'm not sure if there are any good sleep aids that are not addictive.

It is probably still swollen.<br>  <br>  Strains are injuries that affect muscles or tendons, thick bands that attach muscles to bones. They occur in response to a quick tear, twist, or pull of the muscle. Strains are an acute type of injury that results from overstretching or over contraction. Pain, weakness, and muscle spasms are common symptoms experienced after a strain occurs.<br>  <br>  Sprains are injuries that affect ligaments, thick bands of cartilage that attach bone to bone. They occur in response to a stretch or tear of a ligament. Sprains are an acute type of injury that results from trauma such as a fall or outside force that displaces the surrounding joint from its normal alignment. Sprains can range from a mild ligamentous stretch to a complete tear. Bruising, swelling, instability, and painful movement are common symptoms experienced after a sprain occurs.<br>  <br>  RICE is the acronym used for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. It is used as the best initial treatment of soft tissue injuries such as sprains, strains, and contusions. The combination of RICE helps reduce inflammation that occurs after acute injury. It is important to remember that the earlier this treatment is put into place, the more effective it is.<br>  <br>  Rest: Rest and protect the injured area. If it hurts to bear weight on the injury, use crutches, or a cane.<br>  <br>  Ice: Apply ice to the injury. The cold will reduce swelling and pain at the injured site. This step should be done as soon as possible. Apply the frozen object to the area for 20 minutes three times a day for the first 48 hours.<br>  <br>  Compression: Compress the injured site. This will decreases swelling of the injured region. Although the wrap should be snug, make sure it is not too tight as this can cause numbness, tingling, or increased pain.<br>  <br>  Elevation: Elevate the injured area above the level of the heart as much as possible. This technique will also assist in reducing the amount of swelling to the injured site.<br>  <br>  Once the pain and swelling are eliminated, you should start gradual range of motion exercises but not to the point of pain.  Each day your range of motion will increase slightly.  Continue until you have complete range of motion.  Than start gentle strengthening exercises to re-build the strength in the knee.<br>  <br>  The stiffness will go away over time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

5e0deb3ee3b559af235dfa24bded3970aa	Several doctors I have talked with told me that it is caused by an imbalance in your body and diet. You have to change your diet and be very patient to see results. That is the best way and the cheapest. Most often, we have spent our life having an acidic diet while in reality that is a very bad thing. It is better to have a slightly alkaline diet. Also, if you drink diet sodas, you are robbing your body of important minerals. All of the chemicals in our lives cause severe imbalances. Once you get a balance back into your body you will start seeing a change and over time start to feel like a new person. And you won't need chemical scrubs soaps and tons of chemical washes to clear up your skin. Remember, you are what you eat. While Jane covers treating the surface symptoms, it will not make the problem go away. The cause is what you need to attack.  I know people that use to have your problem and they have gotten rid of the problem through changing your diet completely for the better.<br>  <br>  Darlin12 answered with drinking unpasteurized apple cider vinegar. Drinking this in quantity like she says does help. It causes your body's chemical balance to be slightly alkaline instead of acidic. But you still have to change your diet and feed your body in a healthy manner. Vinegar helps with a lot of problems internally. It is amazing how healthy the body gets when allowed to have the chemical balance that it is supposed to have.|`|AA10697205	for acne alone, not birth control....<br>  raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar<br>  heat a qt of water, add 3 tblspns vinegar, make a tent over the pot, cover your head with a towel, steam your face. then dab some vinegar on your skin to clean, do this process 2 more times, then squeeze the blackheads. mix 1/2 water, 1/2 vinegar, chilled, dab on face to close pores and tone skin....<br>  as a skin care routine, <br>  raw unpasturized apple cider vinegar..<br>  Angelina O, has found that applying ACV topically to her face several times a day (4 or more times) has cured her of a "very bad complexion".

Also pick up a LOW strength Benzoyl-peroxide cream, apply the cream by dabbing <br>  to the individual blemishes.... DONT rub it in works using a oxidation/reduction reaction..It will unclog<br>  dry it out and bring it to a head...DONT over use this or put anywhere else on your face. It will cause drying and make you look worse. <br>  <br>  Salicylates such as found in regular asprin among other products work very similar but also remove layers of skin...<br>  other over the counter creams with this product will dry out pimples but maybe too hash and cause surrounding skin trauma..<br>  I have seen many people recommending crushing asprin and making a paste which probably will dry out the blemish but again<br>  pretty strong and probably will cause more tissue damage and bigger scars as an anti inflammatory<br>  probably would take the reddness out... again pretty harsh for sensative skin.<br>  <br>  Also, If need which probably will for moisture ASK FOR "NUTRADERM lotion" - the orginal not the new stuff, this works<br>  great and wont clog pores or leave a residue on your skin...Any lotion that is completely oil free and hypoallergic should<br>  work but again I recommend Nutraderm.  I have heard from people online that "Purpose" also makes a lotion that is good, Nutragena, and Nivea<br>  make good products also.  I recommend Nutraderm from experience and my dematologist.<br>  <br>  "Purpose Bar" & "Nutraderm" are oil free and hypoallergic they contain no perfumes and are great for both men and women.<br>  I have also heard great reports of this soap helping improve skin tone.  Some people recommend the "Purpose luqid soap" saying<br>  that the bar did dry out their skin some.  The rational behind using the bar is that there are no ingredients in it that will clog pores, and<br>  according to dermatologists they recommend the Bar.  I have also heard good responses from "cetaphil soap". These products are safe for all skin colors and tones.  I highly discourage use <br>  of Proactive and other harsh chemicals for people with some natural color in their face due to the bleaching and drying effect it has <br>  shown in many many people. <br>   <br>  Additonal TIPS: acne, pimples, etc are frequently cause by a bacteria or hormone issues that cause clogging of pores. <br>  DONT PICK POP POKE (your hands are the dirtiest part of your body) and will cause: infections, spreading of germs, more breakouts and scarring<br>  DONT EVER listen to people online who tell you to scrub your sensative skin or use harsh chemicals<br>  such as: Lemon juice, vinagar, alcohol, etc... DONT EVER use that APRICOT CRAP!!! DONT USE <br>  PROACTIVE- this is expensive and harsh it may kill the bacteria cause also Benzoyl based wash but<br>  will irritate skin and cause bleaching of face and neck.... Other similar treatments may work.. also <br>  things such as Accutane but have SERIOUS side effects such as Major Depression, & birth defects in unborn children, among others<br>  If you wear make up make sure it is oil free, & hypoallergic...Eating healthy...Drinking plenty of water.. changing pillow cases freq.<br>  etc ...avoiding dirty sports equp. such as helmets...can not hurt...Acne/pimples again are caused by pores/hair follicles becoming plugged<br>  up, this plugging then causes an inflammatory reaction - reddness and infection (pimple)..black head is dirt trapped in pore, while a white <br>  head is the same thing you just dont see the dirt instead you see white pus (lymphocytes that accumulate in the area to fight the infection)<br>  It has been shown in many studies this most often not caused by what you eat (chocolate etc... or how clean you are) but most often by either excess oils plugging pores or a bacteria <br>  on the skins surface. - Proactive works in some people because it is a strong Benzoyl peroxide based washed but is most freq. to strong<br>  for people with sensative skin - this is why alot of people get excessive drying and flaking, rashes, bleaching or breakouts from the product.<br>  Retina-A does decrease the bacterial growth on your face but also removes dead/living skin, this can work well in some individuals and<br>  has been shown to reduce wrinkles and scars but again I feel this is pretty harsh on sensative skin prone to breakouts.  If you choose <br>  Retina-A never use this product during the day only at night due to the sensativity it will give you to the sun.  You must also get a perscription<br>  for this product and I really don't believe it is worth the damage it does to your skin.  In some rare cases for very deep/large boils and cyst types<br>  of pimples oral antibiotics maybe needed but I would first recommend trying "purpose" and a low dose "benzoyl-peroxide cream" along with a good<br>  oil free moisturizer "Nutraderm... etc" this does work well.<br>  <br>  THIS WORKS FAST AND CHEAP!!!  I no longer get expensive facials, take oral antibiotics, or even NEED makeup... I am very happy - Have <br>  very good skin... and have many many other happy friends...

The more overweight you are, the easier it is to lose.  The opposite is true as well... if you only have a little weight to lose, your body will fight you to hold onto it.

Here is how it works. No one teaches the animal what to eat and what not to eat. He knows instinctively what to eat. Humans also have the same instinct. The way it works is just eat whatever tastes good and that will be healthy for you and non-fattening. That is why a baby tastes everything. So again whatever tastes good, is good for you. This is why you will spit out spoiled milk.<br>  <br>  But wait!!! Man has the technology to create rat poison. It tastes like healthy food (good taste) but kills the rat. So man has done that to you. Note- any food unaltered by man (uncooked) that tastes good, is good for you. So if you are stranded in the woods, that is how you  know what to eat (cooking changes that). So man has created fake fruit. It tastes like fruit that exists in nature but it is terrrible for health, addictive and fattening called sweets.<br>  <br>  So it is natural  to like real sweets called fruit, like a baby does, but they have fooled you just like the rat.

The only drawback is that if you have had a long relationship with this doctor, you run the risk of damaging this relationship. As a mother and protector of this child you have to weigh the benefits and choose wisely. Good luck!|`|77969265c9ed783d763b232e0e457795aa	I have received a colonoscopy within the last 6 months. There is nothing painful about it or traumatizing. If the doctor refuses to accept that your 'psychic ability' tells you the child doesn't need it, it would be senseless to try and convince him otherwise. Let the procedure go on as scheduled so the doctor can have hard evidence that nothing is wrong. If someone just walked up to you and said you had cancer, would you go in and start kemotherapy? No. You need hard evidence. Allow the doctor to do his job. You can always seek a second opinion from another doctor. Hopefully your child went in to a specialist (Gastrointestinologist) If so, he certainly knows what he's talking about.|`|AA10231746	Don't take her and get a second opinion.

Replacement therapy is usually taken for life.<br>  It may take several weeks before you notice an improvement in your symptoms.<br>  <br>  SIDE EFFECTS:<br>  Symptoms of low thyroid levels include fatigue, muscle aches, constipation, dry skin, weight gain, slow heart rate, sensitivity to cold, or dry brittle hair that tends to fall out easily. These symptoms should disappear as your body adjusts to the medication. If they persist or become bothersome, notify your doctor promptly.<br>  Headache, nervousness, trembling, sweating, increased appetite, diarrhea, weight loss or insomnia may occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor promptly.<br>  In rare instances, some hair loss may occur during the first few months of starting this drug. This effect is usually temporary as your body adjusts to this medication. If this effect persists or worsens, notify your doctor promptly.<br>  Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.<br>  Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these unlikely but serious side effects: chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath.<br>  Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of these very unlikely but serious side effects: seizures.<br>  An allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include: rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing.<br>  If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.<br>  <br>  PRECAUTIONS:<br>  This medication should not be used if you have certain medical conditions. Before using this medicine, consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have: overactive thyroid conditions (e.g., thyrotoxicosis), a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction), adrenal gland problems (e.g., uncorrected adrenal insufficiency).<br>  Do not use thyroid drugs for weight control.<br>  Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: heart problems (e.g., hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, coronary artery disease), diabetes, male or female infertility problems, bone loss disease (e.g., osteoporosis), other hormone disorders (e.g., hypothalamic/pituitary hormone deficiencies, autoimmune polyglandular syndrome), other thyroid problems (e.g., nontoxic diffuse goiter, nodular thyroid disease), blood clotting disorders, any allergies.<br>  Notify your doctor or dentist that you are taking this medication prior to any surgery.<br>  Caution is advised when using this drug in children because overuse may reduce the child's future adult height.

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant because your dose will have to be adjusted.<br>  Small amounts of this drug pass into breast milk. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  DRUG INTERACTIONS:<br>  Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all prescription and nonprescription drugs you may use, especially of: warfarin, digoxin, estrogen products (including estrogen-containing birth control pills), diabetes medicines (e.g., insulin, glipizide, rosiglitazone), amiodarone, iodide (including radiographic contrast agents containing iodine), lithium, anti-thyroid agents (e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil), androgens/anabolic steroids, glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone, prednisone), high dose salicylates (e.g., aspirin), phenobarbital, rifamycins (e.g., rifampin), beta blockers (e.g., propranolol), antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, maprotiline, sertraline), cytokines (e.g., interferon-alpha, interleukin-2), growth hormones, ketamine, theophylline.<br>  Check the labels on all your medicines (e.g., cough-and-cold products, diet aids) because they may contain ingredients such as decongestants or caffeine that could increase your heart rate or blood pressure. Ask your pharmacist about the safe use of these products.<br>  Certain medicines may decrease absorption of this drug into your bloodstream. Therefore, take levothyroxine 4 hours apart from: calcium supplements, iron supplements, aluminum, calcium or magnesium antacids, simethicone, cholestyramine, colestipol, sucralfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate.<br>  Certain foods may decrease absorption of this medication when taken at the same time.

When taken on an empty stomach or after a meal, there is a greater risk of some tablets causing irritation, or<br>  eventually erosion of the esophageal sphincter, resulting in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).<br>   <br>  It is also advisable not to lie down immediately after taking any pills.<br>   <br>  When taking a very large daily amount of a single nutrient, it is better to split it up into smaller doses to<br>   <br>  not interfere with the absorption of other nutrients in food, or nutrients supplemented at lower amounts.

I've been in the fitness industry for the past 10 years and have trained people with all sorts of fitness goals. Two REASONS why you're not gaining weight, 1.

c6a13cdefd683fdec376ea9ea762cf8faa	I use to have the same problem, my period woulds start kind of brown the first day, go red, then go back to brownish the last day or two. The clots may be just that - clots. But they may also be pieces of tissue, if there are larger chunks (I know it sounds gross) that's probably what they are. That went on for about a year for me (I've been having my period for...geeze...9 years now.)If it's bothering you, you should go see a doctor and he or she can give you some medical reasons why it's happening. <br>  <br>  I don't think your sleeping habits have anything to do with it, but they definitely do put stress on your body. I was like that for about 3 weeks and I'm just getting over it. You have to set a schedule for yourself and stick to it. Wake up at 9:00 am even if you don't want to, then go to sleep at 11:00 or midnight. (I started waking up at 10:00 am and going to sleep about 1:00 am. I usually like around 10 hours of sleep at least, but this works because I get done with my homework by 1 usually, then I have to get up at 10 for classes) If you aren't feeling tired at the end of the day, you might want to start working out, if you don't already. After I started doing it on a regular basis, I started sleeping less, feeling a whole lot better during the day, and at night I'd go to bed quicker than I normally would. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps a little.|`|b47dba98b40983aa448b3c0459ae1d98aa	Well, some people when they get the period, they start with a more brown colored blood, and then later into the period, it goes more red.

Hunger doesn't have to be your stomach feeling empty. You can also be hungry if you are feeling lightheaded or weak or have a headache. Half the time my stomach doesn't feel empty, but because i have a headache or am unable to fully concentrate i know that i have to eat. You are way to underweight, and it is very unhealthy...you could very well die in your sleep. Here's how to gain weight:<br>  <br>  "1) Count how many calories you eat in a normal day. Don't change anything, just eat like you normally would and count how many calories you consumed. This is an extremely important step, so try to be as exact as possible. Also, weigh yourself.<br>  <br>  2) Starting the day after you counted calories, eat 500 calories MORE then you normally do. So, lets pretend that the day you counted calories you counted 2000. For the rest of the week, you would now eat 2500 calories a day. Instead of eating 3 big meals a day or eating all day all the time, spread those calories out over 5-6 smaller meals. Eat one meal every 2 and a half to 3 hours. To get big, you have to eat big! Remember that.<br>  <br>  3) Weightlifting! Get in the gym and lift! This is another important step to how to gain weight, so make sure you are doing it correctly. For more information on weightlifting workout routines and splits, read the workout routines and splits section.<br>  <br>  4) At the end of that week, weigh yourself. You'll notice you're gaining just after one week! Now, don't expect to see a 10lb increase. Gaining anymore then 1 or 2 pounds a week is unhealthy and means you're putting on way to much fat. So look for 1 or 2 pound gains at the end of the week. Don't sound like much? You can be gaining 5-8 pounds a month!<br>  <br>  5) Heres an important one. At some point, you will stop seeing weight gain. At this point, you will have to eat even more. So, when you stop gaining for at least 2 weeks, it means it is time to start eating an extra 250 calories a day. Every time you see you haven't gained weight for at least 2 weeks, add an extra 250 calories."<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to have a ton of protein, like red meat. And drink protein shakes 1-3 times a day (there's a protein powder you can mix with milk, or whatever you want)<br>  But please, act now. You don't want to be hospitalized, do you??|`|AA10418976	Yes it is bad, please see your Dr. or get some other professional help. <br>  I think you already know it is not normal, or you would not be asking the question. <br>  Please take care of yourself and get some treatment immediately.|`|AA11579730	well u r really skinny.. i think u have to see a doctor... dont worry... u just have to eat alot...|`|a526bab75aaa038493f1ea3dbd747f0faa	yes it is bad...definitely see a doctor ASAP...start eating..and if you're worried about getting fat..eat fruits and vegies, ANYTHING...because you're underweight and definitely lacking nutrients...<br>  <br>  At your height you should be at least 100 pounds!!! Please learn to take care of yourself, and see a doctor.
6d0ce236c26e437069d6dbfccb6a0592aa	There are three fluid compartments in the body: the circulatory system (blood stream), inside individual cells, between individual cells. The body is able to keep the  right amount of fluid in the circulatory system by storing fluid in the other compartments  or removing extra fluid with healthy kidneys (through urination).<br>  <br>  When the kidneys don't work the body starts to store that extra fluid wherever it can e.g. in tissue of the legs and feet. Dialysis can take over some of the work of the kidneys but dialysis can only remove fluid from the circulatory system. Over time fluid will move from those other compartments into the circulatory system but by then the dialysis treatment will be over.<br>  <br>  To keep fluid from accumulating in the lungs and ankles people on dialysis must make sure they go to every dialysis appointment and strictly control their fluid intake between treatments. For someone who weighs 150 pounds they will often start seeing swelling in their ankles when they have just three liters of extra fluid in their body - extra fluid is all the fluid healthy kidneys would eliminate.<br>  <br>  If controlling fluid is too hard people can choose to dialyzess longer or more frequently. People who use peritoneal dialysis or dialyze for eight hours over night and/or everyday have a better opportunity to remove fluid that is in or between cells and report feeling better.|`|5233824c344b9d7d10e82fd14c18c71eaa	Indirectly it does. By removing fluid and impurities from the blood with hemodialysis or via the peritoneal cavity with CAPD, eventually the blood is able absorbs more fluid from the lungs and feet which is then removed.

ec7bae9ff40bcd3edd5122ef0728c7fdaa	You know you may want to reverse your diet. Eat a healthy dinner for breakfast and then finish with breakfast. there is a diet out there called the reverse diet. Thius may work well for you becuase you seem to be incontrol in the morning, so possibly placing dinner at that time will control dinner and then having that healthy breakfast for "dinner" later may help your control issues. Since you tend to get relaxed and most of the time have free time around dinner time, you tend to want to eat dinner and keep eating. Don't worry I have been in your shoes. Come up with a routine. For me, I get home around 5 ish from the gym. I will have a glass of something to drink, then i will do some school work, then I will start  cook dinner, eat, drink again, then i have something little like a square of chocolate broken up into 10-15 pieces. The I will drink one more time before 8 o'clock! After eight the frige is closed. Things that help make it so you are okay with this is making sure your dinner has ample healthy fats to keep you satisfied, and not too many processed carbs, which actually stimulate you cravings for more food! <br>  <br>  As for your throwing up. I think it is a mental thing. When I eat to much of not so good for me foods, I honestly want to barf. But I keep things in perspective, one day won't hurt me. For you I think it important to understand that you body is something to love and cherish. Throwing up will do more harm then good. Remove all those trigger foods that when you eat make you feel badly. If they are not there you won't eat them. <br>  <br>  Another idea that may help is making your dinner at lunch time or the day before, that way you can just heat it up eat and for get about it. <br>  <br>  Lat suggestion may be eating dinner and going to the gym as soon as your done. Something about working out makes you really not hungary, it is weird. <br>  <br>  Last last idea, could be after dinner walk to you nearest starbucks and get a decaf coffee, low sugar, coffee curbs my cravings and is something to do and warm beverages make me not really want to eat. <br>  <br>  Good Luck! And if the throwing up continues. COnsult a doctor.|`|35a46c40a75ba25c0ce9608315c0e0fbaa	You are obviously binge eating which usually happens when people try to "stuff" down negative feelings using food.  Do you do this at night because you are depressed/sad/lonely/bored ?  I'd really try to look into how you were feeling before you started eating that night maybe keep a journal and monitor your feelings each night before you begin to eat dinner.  I'll bet it's emotionally related. If it's something you can't improve upon on your own at that point I'd seek out the help of a doctor/therapist. Good luck and try to care of yourself !|`|NhHa3Zpgaa	eating out of control can be caused by not being satisfied.  you may not be eating a lot during the day which would cause your stomach to go in starvation mode by dinner time.  you probably over-eat because your breakfast and lunch are not satisfying enough for you.  you need to snack inbetween meals.  if you are trying to be healthy, snack on some nutrional bars or anything else that you have that is healthy.  if you 'snack', it will prevent you from eating out of control like you have been.|`|ldhoKhOQaa	I used to have the same problem.

Fn1MkGPDaa	well, first of all, if you did not have hepatitis b or c, you would be "bi-polar". viruses pass the blood brain barrier. so this alone would be a good reason to try and treat, however, some doctors do not allow those with mental disease to do treatment because it can have severe psychiatric side effects, same thing goes for alcohol...they will not treat until you've been clean for at least 6 months. as for the mental issue? as long as your taking medication for it, you should be allowed to try treatment. <br>  you can tell them that mental disease is a side effect of having viral infections. <br>  <br>  you can qualify for free medications if you are approved for treatment. i'm not sure if dually infected you can do treatment, but they are using interferon and ribavirin for both types of hepatitis.<br>  <br>  the only thing you can do right now is ask. it's not going to hurt.<br>  <br>  treatment is a form of chemotherapy. not sure how long treatment would be for you, but given you have both types and are approved, i suspcet at least 48 weeks of treatment.<br>  <br>  as for the alcohol? it is allowing the virus or viruses to do faster damage-it gives HCV a free ride to party hard and to cause faster scarring or cirrhosis of the liver. STOP NOW. do what it takes. the only choice for you is for YOU to see to it-if you choose to live! This is really your only option!<br>  <br>  i would further like to state that with hcv or hbv the first sign is depression-which leads to abuse of substances. if you keep this in your mind, you might be able to overcome your addiction to alcohol-it is a must you do so. <br>  <br>  i lost a friend to hcv and alcohol abuse. he was found laying naked in his back yard. he was in a coma and it was much too late as the virus and toxins from the failing liver caused him to weaken his heart so bad that dialysis wasn't an option. it was a horrible way to go.|`|8c0b7ed60a19a3c1e7d820e5d20a33abaa	Just go on and go to the doctor,or better yet talk to the person that has you on the medtcation for bypolor,they should be able to make some suggestions,and believe in God for a miracle.My brother is in simalar boat, he has hep-B, he went to MD. first thing they tell you is to stop drinking,he said he couldn`t so he stopped going to doc.You have to make a choice,you are gonna quit drinking one way or the other,either quit on your own or die.

Complex carbs give you energy, but are also stored which can make you gain fat.<br>  <br>  Try and have fibrous carbs, brocolli, spinach, lettuce, cabbage, etc., with every meal. Especially late at night. Fibrous carbs give you a little bit of energy, but help with fat loss. Try and eat a cup of brocolli before you go to bed.

It may take longer than you would like, but it is as fast as starving/fasting and better for you. There is no way to magically melt fat, but low carb (NOT no carb) and lots of cardio is the fastest way there is. You probably get a decent amount of exercise, so it's the diet that you need to watch.<br>  <br>  A good low carb diet is the low GI diet or the South Beach diet. You can pick up the books at any bookstore or try and see if your library has them. <br>  <br>  There is also one out that is called "You on a diet" - I don't know that much about that one, but there was a TV special on it where they helped people lose weight.

This allows your body to get all the things it needs to function correctly and so you don’t feel hungry or tired. By doing this instead of going on one of these current craze diets you will be successful. I used a protein based diet with Herbalife after a friend who had lost weight recommended it to me. All the way through you feel great and energized, you also get great coaching and support along the way. The people are very friendly and gave me lots of great advice. I needed to lose 40 pounds and I did so fairly easily. There is no pressure and they will even send you a load of free samples so you can try before you buy. The samples were the thing that initially convinced me that this was the right path to choose, I could tell the difference right away. The products really work and you feel great whilst losing weight. They are fun to work with as well as being serious about helping you lose weight.<br>  I lost all my weight in less than four months and they have helped me to keep it off. I would definitely recommend using them, the tips you get and encouragement are excellent (their advice and time is FREE). I am still with them so I stay healthy. The owners will advise you on what to purchase depending on what you want to lose, my sister did this also and lost 76 pounds in less than five months. The website is www.myhealthabc.com, if you want to lose the healthy way and quickly then this is for you. You just leave your details and they call you up, I would suggest that if you aren’t sure or don’t want someone to ring you then go to their main site www.myhealthabcmall.com and you can see all the products and packages. This is what I did before I went to the first site and left my details so they could contact me. You can see with all the products and detail they have that they mean business.

Diets are not really the answer.  What you need to do is eat differently by following a food plan or even better, talking to your doctor.  Your doctor can set you up on a plan to lose weight or refer you to a nutritionist.  You should also keep junk food out of your house because it's hard to resist (that's what I have to do.  If I have sweets around the house, I'll eat them all in one day).  You might also want to keep a food diary.  We often do not realize how many calories we eat a day until we keep track of it.  The most basid rule of weight loss is take in fewer calories than you use.  If you are eating more than you use, then you will gain weight.  Simple as that.

Anything else is only short term.|`|bd48356d45ad5fcaa19fb26a6b14a2c1aa	This worked really well for me and my sis, if losing some pounds of any description and inches is what you want then I would suggest you use a diet that is all natural and is rich in protein and vitamins.  I used a protein based diet with Herbalife after a friend who had lost weight recommended it to me. All the way through you feel great and energized, you also get great coaching and support along the way. The people are very friendly and gave me lots of great advice. I needed to lose 40 pounds and I did so fairly easily. There is no pressure and they will even send you a load of free samples so you can try before you buy. The samples were the thing that initially convinced me that this was the right path to choose. The products really work and you feel great whilst losing weight. You also a get e free complete health consultation with the samples, I think I just paid the postage, but for what I got it was well worth it.<br>  I lost all my weight in less than four months and they have helped me to keep it off. I would definitely recommend using them. The owners will advise you on what to purchase depending on what you want to lose, my sister did this also and lost 76 pounds in less than five months. The website is www.myhealthabc.com. You just leave your details and they call you up, I would suggest that if you aren’t sure or don’t want someone to ring you then go to their main site www.myhealthabcmall.com and you can see all the products and packages. This is what I did before I went to the first site and left my details so they could contact me. You can see with all the products and detail they have, so you know that they mean business. Its nice to have contact with real people who care about you losing weight and improving your health.  I know that I will continue to keep the weight off with the help I have received. I hope this helps.|`|AA11120204	Fast and effective is no more than 1200 calories per day! Problem is..it's hard to stick with that for more than a few days!

So to be fair, it should be called, healthy lifestyle. :)<br>  <br>  Eat small meals several times a day. About 6 spread out throughout the day and lots of plain water to flush out unwanted toxins. Your meals should contain about 100-200 calories per meal. <br>  <br>  This will ensure a more stable metabolism rate as opposed to chucking 1000 calories per time and overloading yourself.<br>  <br>  For an intensive list of food and how many calories they contain, go to the website I've included below. All the best! :)|`|DjR0N0sRaa	I'm not sure if you would consider this a diet, but the trick is to raise your metabolism. You can do this by being more active and eating small snacks throughout the day. I eat ALOT of chocolate EVERY day and I really don't watch what I eat. The dr. told me that I have the metabolism of a hummingbird, which is a very good thing. I'm 5 ft. 3 in and weigh about 115 and am 47 years old, but I am very active. You can change your metabolism and the faster it is, the better. Also, alot of the time when you think you are hungry....you're actually thirsty. Try drinking some water when you start to feel hungry.....it works!|`|UufzM6Yxaa	Well tofu is really good for you. alot of protein but doesnt get u fat. and its not meat. Asian food i believe.

They’re just hidden under a layer of body fat. All the sit-ups, crunches, and hanging leg lifts in the world won’t help your six-pack show if they’re covered by fat. Unfortunately, you can’t spot reduce. You’ll need to lose overall body fat. Eat less and exercise more.
wEFceEebaa	Your basal metabolic rate is 1313 calories.   This means you can eat 1313 calories a day without gaining weight if you mostly just rest.  On the days when you don't exercise, use the 1313 as a guide.  On the days when you run track, it depends heavily upon how much activity you actually do during practice.  Do you run for a solid 2 hours?  Is some of the time spent standing still while the coach talks?  This also depends how fast you run, how fast is your mile and how long do you maintain it.  Assume, for the sake of discussion, that you run an average of 6 mph or a 10 minute mile.  If you ran that solidly for an hour, you would burn about 550 calories.  On the other hand, if you sprinted very fast for an hour, which is unlikely (say an average of 10 mph or a 6 minute mile), you would burn about 900 calories.   Running for an hour cross country (varying the pace) would burn about 500 calories an hour.  Do it for 2 hours and it burns between 1,000 - 1,800 calories burned.  Add this to the basal metabolic rate.   THEREFORE, on the days you run only, you can consume 2,300 to 3,100 calories and maintain your weight.   Experiment with the math and the numbers and you will find your maintenance level,|`|f9LzdfkNaa	it sounds like you've got it covered, because you run so much.|`|54db79d135a392ca287522d91f48126faa	The mind should be as a mirror.|`|qlnpJRa1aa	you dont have to worry about it because your excercising so much but i would say 2000+

ZxDSqNW3aa	Running is a really good way to tone your legs. The extra bulk in your legs is the muscle building up under the fat, and soon the fat will go away if you keep exersizing. <br>  <br>  The belly fat will slightly go away with the tredmill, but I suggest you try to do crunches, sit ups, and other stomach exersizes to make that go away. You could also try eating less fatty foods for a while and see if that works. DONT STARVE YOURSELF.. just eat healthier stuff, like baking not frying. Another really good machine to tone your entire body is a rowing machine.|`|3352d70758fb37630285d53d04d0fc10aa	well running on a treadmill should help you lose fat, but it may be that you haven't altered your diet to a healthier one which is impeding weight loss.  and treadmills may be bad for your joints and such so you  might want to switch to low impact.  yes running then walking is a good idea (interval training) run at a decent pace for 5 minutes then walk for a minute or so then run for 5 min again and so on.  if you work out everyday muscle mass will slowly lessen ( for your thighs) i'm working on the same thing, again fat loss will help.  cellulite, their are creams, and getting more toned will definitely help.  Good luck and happy running :)|`|62fec9b1a0dbb0b67ce7514beb9e2cc8aa	yes, running is a great way to tone your body.<br>  <br>  try doing crunches afterwards too =)|`|W9BykIiyaa	Running is excellent and when on the treadmill don't increase the incline.

RMeTRZGVaa	You are doing it the right way. Diet, Eating in moderation, and exercise is the only permanent way to weight loss. <br>  <br>  Their is no miracle Exercise, What ever you like to do is what you should do. so if it is swimming, biking, sports, weight lifting, whatever, as long as you are being active You will lose weight. <br>  <br>  There are three forms of exercise: cardiovascular, strength-building, and flexibility. Cardiovascular exercise is also known as aerobic exercise. For example, walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are aerobic activities. These types of exercises drive your body to use oxygen more efficiently and deliver maximum benefits to your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. A simple definition of cardiovascular exercise is any exercise that raises your heart rate to a level where you can still talk, but you start to sweat a little. At least 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise 3 or 4 days a week should be enough to maintain a good fitness level. Any movement is good, even house or yard work. But if your goal is to lose weight, you will need to do some form of cardiovascular exercise for 5 or more days a week for 30 to 45 minutes or longer.<br>  <br>  Strength-building exercises are known as anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercise does not have cardiovascular benefits, but it makes your muscles and bones stronger. Strength-building exercises require short, intense effort. People who lift weight or use any type of equipment that requires weights are doing strength-building exercise. Strength-building exercise makes your muscles and bones stronger and increases your metabolism. Strength exercises also make your muscles larger. Your muscles use calories for energy even when your body is at rest. So, by increasing your muscle mass, you are burning more calories all of the time. If you strength train regularly, you will find that your body looks leaner and you will loose fat. Strength building exercises should be performed 2 to 3 times a week for best results. Always warm up your muscles for 5 to 10 minutes before you begin lifting any type of weight or before performing any resistance exercises.<br>  <br>  Flexibility exercises, which are also anaerobic, tone your muscles through stretching and can prevent muscle and joint problems later in life. A well balanced exercise program should include some type of each exercise from each category. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Another key to weightloss is eating in moderation. Do Not say no sweets because that will make you want them even more, and when you cave in and have 1 scoop of icecream, you will probbaly end up binging on it because, "What the heck you already ruined your Diet Right?" So eat everything in moderation. Also eat slow, it takes your body about 30 min to realize it is full so keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  You can't lose weight, fast, and keep it off. In order to be healthy you should lose between 1 and two pounds a week.|`|9a0738dee2c7b59e975ba9aadfb14891aa	You have it easy I'm 14 5 foort 6 and I'm 171 [woo lost 9 lbs.] lol|`|AA10920914	Firstly, if you want to loose weight, measure your ideal weight. I'll give you a chart so you can do this yourself:<br>  <br>  For every 5'' add 100 pounds<br>  For every inch after that add 5 pounds. <br>  <br>  <br>  Secondly, your diet may have alot to do with your weight. In order to loose weight, you need to cut your calories, but without hurting yourself as well. The best way to do this is to lower the amount of what you eat. For example, let's say you have two scoops of potatoes. Try 1 scoop next time instead of 2. This will cut your calories in half. Second, try jogging/running or walking a mile a day. Since jogging/walking/running work all the muscles of your body, it's a great way to loose weight without the cost. <br>  <br>  Finally, try substituting soda with sport drinks, teas and water. They taste just as good and they're better for you. This should pretty much cover your question.<br>  <br>                     Hope it helps!|`|mJJ9rl9Iaa	eat healthy and exercise|`|owdCD8Ghaa	eat healthy and exercise ... if you think you really need help .. have a parent take you to your doctor ( or you can go by yourself)... they will give you pills or an exercise plan.... do not turn to any type of eating disorder they do not help and they can kill you...|`|AA11438887	Eat healthier and exercise.

Since both Hepa A & Hepa B are the most common as they are both viral & both contagious, B being extremely contagious that is reason why it is tested in the centers, antibiotics dont work in this cases @ all. So it is easier to locate & cheaper to buy, MILK THISTLE it regenerates liver cells that have been damaged & helps improve liver function by helping liver remove toxins from your body) try any herb store. If you have a juicer take carrot juice, about a jigger @ least 2x a week; take Super B=complex, Calcium & Magnesium, & Vitamin C w/flavonoids, Lecithin if you can buy if not, eat a lot of mung sprouts & mongo, CO Q 10 is super mahal so instead eat sardines 3x a week; avoid fats, alcohol, sugar & highly processed foods & avoid smoking as it weakens your immune system; avoid raw fish & shellfish fish & try to eat less animal protein; when able put warm castor oil packs over the liver o kaya rub your liver area w/castor oil & put a heat pad over it; & there was one poster who mentioned bovine colostrum that can be bought @ GNC, yes thats way cheaper & same results as the Transfer, & if you can find RED CLOVER TEA BAGS @ GNC or any herb store take bout 3 cups daily (dont need a mug so 1 Tea Bag will be good for your daily routine) salabat or ginger tea is another tea to take; & Tumeric which is found in Curry powder is excellent, so kumain din ng Chicken Curry.

Todo depende del cuerpo de la mujer en cuestión.<br>  <br>  Espero que te halla servido mi respuesta, un beso grande!<br>  Saludos!|`|8f32579285d84923c57e4cc08ee44f0daa	estas bromeando? google.com|`|aufGAs9Eaa	Mira, el himen como debes saberlo es tan solo una peque?a y fragil "telita", por lo tanto puede romperse por infinidad de causas sin haber tenido coito.<br>  Puede ser por hacer ejercicio, algun golpe, introduccion de algun objeto en la masturbacio, o de tus propios dedos..., sin embargo eso no te hace mas ni menos, asi que no te atormentes con esa duda y mejor vive cada dia como si fuera el ultimo.<br>  Cuidate|`|jm6bt1slaa	Se puede romper por otras causas por ejemplo al tener una caida muy fuerte... aunque es muy raro....|`|74773a029ed1945c9e86c25de5a1f3ffaa	No es solamente con una relación sexual.

Está demostrado que los tampones distienden progresivamente el himen y acaban ensanchando el orificio. Lo mismo puede decirse de la práctica regular de la equitación, de la danza o de deportes violentos.<br>  Pero también existe la situación opuesta. La elasticidad del himen es tal que, a veces, permanece íntegro después de varios contactos sexuales. Es más, hay casos de mujeres embarazadas con el himen intacto. Por tanto, ni los mismos médicos pueden constatar si una mujer mantuvo relaciones sexuales en el pasado, posea o no la membrana vaginal|`|7KS1pl5Iaa	lo normal es que se romp a la primera relacion ya que se encuentra   ADENTRO DE LA VAJINA!!!!!   asi quemientras no entre nada no se rompe jaja asi que no quieras enganar a tu novio  jijijijiji....<br>   pero tambien  puede romprse si as tenido accidentes  fuertes como  en la infancia jugando con un colimpio  y tuviste una caisa muy fuerte  y tambien  con el sube y baja  eso lo que porue en la escuela de medicina se explican caso asi pero en la vida real nunca  e conocido a alguien que le pase eso

Es probable que te refieran con un endocrinólogo, pero recuerda que las pruebas de laboratorio nos permiten deducir signos y síntomas hasta llegar al diagnostico correcto. Esperemos que sea algo pasajero sencillo de controlar. Todo esto puede ser causado desde una infección, anemia, etc. pero la mejor opinión la tendrá tu médico. Acude lo más pronto posible.
nBZH2XEeaa	There is no such thing as focal neurology.  A doctor might say a person has "no focal neurologic deficits."  That just means there are no symptoms that point to a specific area of the brain or spinal cord where the doctor might look with a CT scan for something wrong.  A focal deficit might be something like right-sided weakness or loss of vision on one side or the other.    <br>  <br>  A person might have "general neurologic deficits," like overall weakness or altered mental status, but no focal (localized) deficits.

w07AUmeBaa	Hey there... I struggled with ITB for ages also. Something that unfortunately can be common in long distance runners...<br>  <br>  My solution when I was training very heavily was to have a regular massage -- I was lucky and got a therapist who used to travel with olympians and ballet troupes... he showed me a couple of things I could do myself to avoid... they were actually running specific massage techniques I could do myself and a couple of stretches... find the best person you can and talk to them.<br>  <br>  I hate stretches don't feel bad about not doing them... I have never bothered, I read an article years ago abou the number of muscle injuries in running and the stat's showed that a massive amount of these are a result of a incorrect stretches it did not mention anywhere the need to stretch.<br>  <br>  Just something to note.

I say eat more fatty. But not bad fat. Monosaturated and Polysaturated are the good fats. And Omega-3 and Omega-6 are really good for you. Eat nuts and organic peanutbutter (buy the kind with out Hydrodgenated or Partially Hydrodgenated Oils). It might taste a little funky, but you can put Jelly on it. It's worth it if you want to gain weight. Do strength training everyother day and stop Cardio or whatever you are doing--it burns more fat. Strength training adds: muscle, weight, and tones you up. Remember, Muscle weighs more than fat. I hope you gain weight (as a compliment ;)  )!|`|23f5faf99183332fc7a8dc101f94819baa	weight lifting can help and since you want to gain weight or mass do low reps in sets of 3-5 maximum weight you can lift each time 3x a week everyother day. you body needs time to recuperate so don't try to do more days. diet is important also protien and carb intake needs to be increased. you don't need to go crazy with the diet intake but will need a little experimenting for your body type. you will drop lbs at first but after 4-5 weeks you should gain weight through muscle gain which is good. how much is up to you. there are products at health food stores that can help in gaining mass but they are expensive a good diet of protien and carbs should be sufficient for your needs assuming you don't want to become an olympic candidate or something. rest very important try for a good solid 8 hours a night as this is the time your body repairs itself to build new tissue(muscle) to replace torn down cells. there are also good books you can buy that will give you a complete workout schedule to help realize your goals. dedication,perserverance and confidence are very important in what you can achieve. so if your schedule calls for you to workout but you'd like to do something else stick to your schedule. It doesn't have to be the exact same time each time but should be on the same day. remember low reps 3-5 for at least 3 sets maximum weight you can handle for each exercise(squats,deadlifts,bench press overhead press) on the next exercise day increase weight by 5lbs follow same reps and sets number. after you achieve your goal it will be important to do maintence exercises so as to not eventually revert back to old self. it is at this point you may want to cut back on diet intake to keep from adding fat which is no good and should be avoided.

yUMXP4VWaa	Yeah you defffinitely don't need to workout muscle groups 3 days a week, especially if they make you that sore. It sound like you've got a really good plan though. <br>  <br>  I use MapMyRun to draw a map of my runs on google maps, then add in my weight, age, sex and the time it took me to run it. You can save each map of your runs and then clock your times and see your progress over time on graphs for your speed aswell as the automatically calcuated calories burned ( since you should be focusing on your diet aswell). The site keeps a calendar of your workouts aswell as your daily weight (buy a digital scale and weigh yourself daily) and graphs all results. <br>  <br>  You really dont need to focus on pushing yourself so hard that you can't move for 2 days. You will get sick of it, you need to focus on making this your new lifestyle. Id recommend mmaybe working out 2 sets of muscle groups (a)bicepts, shoulders, quads (b)tricepts, chest, calves 2 times a week at the very most. You may want to start out only once, don't push youself to hard. Cardio and a low calorie diet will really help you out most to begin with. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://beta.mapmyrun.com/" rel="nofollow">http://beta.mapmyrun.com/</a>|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	Congrats on getting started.<br>  <br>  My former personal training clients benefitted from alternating days of cardio and weights.  Cardion on Monday, Wednesday,and Friday; Weights on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  This cycle will probably give you the best opportunity not to wait for equipment at the gym.  It will also help keep you ready for your next workout and should lessen the soreness levels.|`|AA11099683	Hello...Congratulations on your weight loss.  Here is what I would recommend...Weight train your upper body on Monday and Thursday, your lower body on Tuesday and Friday, and do aerobic activity every day of the week (after your weight training).  The soreness you speak about is most likely from the fact that you just began weight training.  If you continue to weight train and, most importantly, stretch the muscles that are sore, you will eventually find that you are no longer sore after weight training.  To keep from burning out just switch the weight training exercises you do about every month (there are many from which to choose for every body part).  Keep up the good work!|`|ttDaPAiFaa	Greetings come out of the closet !! You closet Queen
hbPCrWd0aa	I find that if i start to feel something slowing me down, I go out and exersize for a while. I jog at the beach. usually in the evenings. Its peaceful and the air is crisp and moist. the water is relaxing and the sand is soft to run on. you have to run on the hard pack otherwise you get nowhere and your legs get fried. Good Luck!|`|b84bb05d2608ef197af2b08b39ed34c9aa	Take Vitamin C daily.  When you feel your sickness coming on take some Encineaccia & Golden Seal.

Remember no matter how you look you are always beautiful on the inside.|`|qLsocjKFaa	You don't need to lose weight. I worked around super models in the fashion industry and they would not even want to be that thin. Go have fun outside, eat good foods and stop worrying about your weight.<br>  <br>  You should only eat two or three servings of meat in a day, lean meats like fish and chicken are best. The serving size is about the size of a pack of cards. <br>  <br>  I think at age 14 your body doesn't need to be on a diet, just go be more active! Go play outside, go for a run, take horseback riding lessons or tennis lessons. I think if you want to diet, make sure you are eating complete nutrition. Whole grains with an egg white in the morning, fish and salad for lunch with some whole grain bread, and for dinner have london broil, steamed vegetables and some wild rice! Don't deprive yourself of good foods at this age, your body needs them! You also need good fats, like from olive oil, so eat that instead of creamy dressing on your salads. Also you need to be getting enough fiber, have fruit and raw nuts as a snack for fiber and protein. Don't mistake good sugar for bad as a lot of people do - an apple is good, candy not so good. If you want to learn more about diets and eating healthy foods, try a magazine like Fitness or Self, they can really give great recipes and things. Also don't think eating less is a good diet, eat more, healthy foods until you feel full. When you don't eat enough your metabolism slows and your body retains the foods you do eat (i.e. you will gain the wrong kind of weight). If you eat enough, and healthy foods, and are active, your body will process everything you eat. Good luck.|`|1dVNIXqYaa	Damn, you girls and your preoccupation with weight loss, when are you going to get a life and eat a balanced diet, drink milk for bone development, vegetables for vitamins and minerals and roughage, and get off your *** and exercise,  that's  all there is to keeping fit.  get the picture?|`|67ee4352d0b44d3b41ee3a189849a032aa	There is no safe way to lose weight in one week.

Luckily if you continue to improve your health with exercise and proper eating you are likely to prolong your life. Diabetes which your mother died from if it was type to could have been reversed if she had exercised and made severe changes in diet. Obviously the alcohol thing killed your dad. I would also recommend cut out anything that is heavy in preservatives or other additives. Fresh fruits and vegetables taste better any way and deliver the most vitamins. Knock of the highly acidic foods and drinks the acidity makes you more prone to cancer. Carbonated drinks also cause gastric problems.  When you do drink stay away from the hard stuff and beer thy are horrible for your system. You might want to get into wine a little it lends itself to moderation and is actually great for you system. <br>  I also am an ex smoker and quit in 04' I started running about 4 months ago along with my lifting and boy I feel like I am in better shape than my early 20's.

Gulping water down doesn't hydrate you because it just goes to your stomach.  It's better to sip it, and mix in some Gatorade with it.  Your probably dizzy because you are dehydrated.  Stay away from those pre-workout drinks.

Then rest one day and then do as many pushups as you can in one set and then rest 5 minutes.  Do that as many times as you can.  Then rest one day and do a pyramid set.  Only three days of week, trust me I was stubborn and thought "hey I can recover quicker", but the truth is that if you skip a day then your muscles get a lot stronger.  Good luck.

L6aku6txaa	No te sientas mal y mas bien te felicito se ve que eres una mujer que sabe como complacer a su esposo, especialmente en la cama, de pronto el esta a?orando los momentos que pasaba contigo y que tu ahora no le puede brindar no por el hecho que hayas dejado de ser mujer, mas bien porque tu cuerpo aloja a ese ser con con amor fue consevido.<br>  No es necesario sacar conclusiones sin saber lo que siente tu pareja.<br>  Ese es sintoma de que tu le haces falta y mucha pues si lo encontraste masturbandose es porque imagina el acto sexual contigo, mas no por lo que ve la pelicula, esto te lo dijo por experiencia, si tu marido no es un enfermo sexual es lo que le debe haber pasado por la cabeza, pues tu eres la mujer ideal para el, el resto solo son fantasias.<br>  Hay muchas maneras de hacer el amor con una mujer embarazada intenta algunas posiciones nuevas en donde se sientan comodos los dos y hablen y entiendan que no porque tu estas embarazada no deben tener relaciones, cuando mi esposa estuvo embarazada hicimos el amor hasta el dia del parto, y le ayudo mucho incluso por la lubricacion.<br>  Asi que no te deprimas, talvez son miedos que el tenga, y entiendelo asi, preguntale.<br>  Algunas posiciones que puede practicar para tener relaciones que te recomiendo:<br>  <br>  ? Ponte de lado, mami. Si tu pareja se te pone encima, tendrá que hacer muchas acrobacias cuando tu barriga esté ya grandecita. Pero si están medio de lado, el peso de tu pareja no recaerá de pleno sobre tu útero.<br>  <br>  ? Sexy. Saca partido de la cama. Si te acuestas de espaldas con las rodillas dobladas, y con los pies y la vagina  apoyados en el borde de la cama, tu barriga no será un obstáculo. Tu pareja puede arrodillarse en el borde de la cama o pararse frente a ti.<br>  <br>  ? Suavecito. Acuestecen de lado, uno detrás del otro, como dos cucharas pegadas. La penetración así es menos profunda, lo cual a veces se agradece, ya que a medida que avanza el embarazo una penetración muy profunda puede resultar incómoda.<br>  <br>  ? Tú mandas. Ponte sobre tu pareja. De esta forma no habrá peso sobre tu abdomen y podrás controlar la profundidad de la penetración.<br>  <br>  ? ?A cabalgar! Pídele a tu pareja que se siente en una silla (resistente) y siéntate sobre él. Esta posición tampoco pone peso sobre el útero. <br>  <br>  Y recuerda que las relaciones sexuales durante el embarazo no causan ningun riesgo para el bebe, pues el esta protegido por una membrana muy gruesa, que impide cualquier tipo de contacto con el.<br>  <br>  Lo que si debes tener en cuenta es un buen aseo personal antes de hacerlo, y que tu marido disfrute todo el mes ya que no hay riesgo de otro embarazo.<br>  Suerte|`|0c3c1334d230c92ea2dd28d7688b9227aa	Porque quizaas los hombres tenemos mala fama...pero cara a los embarazos, nos cuidamos lo hombres mucho de que no llegaramos a hacer da?o al futuro bebe.....Catalunya...Espa?a.......banano|`|3d9b7f7e8a7f4ddddc65d0386ecfafa2aa	Le haz preguntado porque? haz hablado con el al respecto? yo creo que el ha de tener alguna idea en su cabecita de porque no lo deben hacer, no es que no quiera porque si sigue cari?oso contigo quiere decir su amor hacia ti no ha cambiado, pero seguro que piensa que puede pasarte algo a ti o al bebe si tienen sexo..yo te recomiendo que le preguntes directamente, veras que todo se soluciona.|`|a4ca8e0abfbe940cd3448cd7f5472305aa	es muy normal supongo que tienen el tipico miedo de que da?aran al bebe o que el bebe los va ver o que los van a sentir...hazle entender que hacer el amor es beneficioso al bb,ya que se liberan ciertas hormonas que le generan placer al feto, no el mismo que sentis vos o el , otro tipo de sensacion...y si no quiere penetrarte busca otra manera de que encuentre placer contigo y no frente a una compu, no tienes manos tu?, eso hazle ver... que tu tambien puedes hacerlo volar de placer aunque el no quiera penetrarte...nada mejor que vos y no una simple maquina con un par de lolas y un cu...divino, lo puede conseguir contigo y mas placentero para ambos...<br>  no te desanimes a muchas mujeres nos ha pasado esto, aunque no lo quieran reconocer, es miedo a romper la "casita del bebe"...<br>  suerte, animo...|`|eed70c9eff0e9ff39e1dc5c34af0c7f6aa	eso es muy simple...tiene la idea de que puede da?ar al bb...por eso no lo quiere hacer contigo...no por que no quiera...sino por miedo....|`|n32HZnpSaa	Amiga, eso es muy normal.

Though people choose either of the two methods to lose fat, the fastest, the easiest and the long-term way is to combine both the methods. Eating more and exercising more is far better than starving, which lowers the metabolism, thus slowing the fat-burning process. Exercise plays a vital role in keeping your metabolism high, thus speeding up the process of burning fat.

dDmGGHs6aa	Is she constipated? You can really get bowel spasms before you have to go. <br>  Sometimes bowel spasms can happen even when you are not constipated. My daughter gets horrible abdominal pain sometimes. She gets easily constipated. They won't always admit it to you either, or really understand it. My daughter gets very pale looking, and say she doesn't feel good her abdomen really hurts and just lays on the couch looking so uncomfortable and sick. The cramps get so bad! She can't attend school when she gets like this. She now has been to Sick Kids Hospital for this. They say she has what they call a "Lazy Bowel".A pediatrician is always helpful,and she really needs to be honest about her bowel habits, because there are many natural things like "Senekot" she could take if she isn't going at least every other day. If this is what it is!<br>  It can even be their diet or what they just ate. Lactose or gluten can be brutal for some people, and they don't even know they are intolerant until something like this comes along that the doctors can't figure out. They have awesome tests for available for those allergies.<br>  I keep a heating pad handy for those days she is in pain it helps. Sometimes I even offer her an ice pack to preoccupy her.<br>  Ibuprofen can cause abdominal pain too in some people so be careful. <br>  I'm sure you already thought of this, but she is also at the age for her menstrual cycle...could it be pre menstrual cramps mine were worse mid month then when I was getting my period! I use to get them 7 days before my period, and then I would feel great ...and wham I got my period and I was crampy again until that was over.<br>  I am so sorry she is going through this I sympathize for her and you!

I do know of some men where not having a condom has also resulted in the same problem, but I know plently of others where it hasn't been an issue. <br>  2) Yes alcohol is a major contribution to this and therefore you should cut it out and try to learn to do without it. You may see it like a benefit, however, it truly is a burden to most women for a man to keep pounding away for 40mins. <br>  3) Nerves, lack of commitment, and just inexperience can also be a factor. What makes you afraid to have sex sober? It feels so much better and the intensity of it are so much more awesome.<br>  4) If I love him and he isn't good, no I will not cheat on him. I will stand by and try to encourage and teach him so that hopefully the sex will improve. Will I stand by him forever if the sex isn't good?

ec11919c98cec7b61c0ed6ad22e457f4aa	Yes!! I was on Prozac and I rarely ever slept. The side effects did not go away after 4 to 6 weeks and the depression did not get better. I was on it for 6 months! <br>  <br>  My doctor prescribed Trazodone (another antidepressant with drowsiness as a side effect) to help me sleep. Usually it didn't, but sometimes it did and I would have dreams that were very vivid and disturbing, so I complained to my doctor. The only complaint he listened to! Anyway, he then gave me another antidepressant called Remeron, which is supposed to have drowsiness as a side effect too, but clearly it didn't. I did get my appetite back though.<br>  <br>  A few months after quitting Prozac, I tried esctasy for the first and last time. I only took half a pill of E, but Prozac was exactly that feeling except on E I didn't experience any anxiety. It's a little  bit euphoric, a little energized and aroused and very awake but not enough to stop the depression.|`|6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	Have you tried taking it in the morning?  This can often help with the sleep disturbances.  You're right about the side effects dwindling.  Often when your body begins to adjust to the drug the side effects will diminish or disappear.  I have taken a few different SSRI's and they usually gave me some anxiety and agitation for several hours after I took them.  So I would take the meds when I got up in the morning.|`|1bvxIZ8Eaa	I had insomnia with Prozac, but only when I went up to 40mg a day.<br>  <br>  Am now on Effexor and yep, insomnia again! I find the only thing that seems to work is to take the medicine very late at night, at about midnight, or even later - for some reason that enables me to sleep better than if I take it in the early evening.<br>  <br>  Some people on anti depressants have to end up taking sleeping pills to counteract the insomnia. If you really can't find any other way round this problem, do speak to your doctor.|`|5YcNCzrfaa	Hi:<br>  Yes, that is a side effect for me also.  I sleep only 3 or 4 hrs a day.

If I ask the doctor about it he generally prescribes something else to "help" me sleep. Usually Trazadone or Clonidine. They help me sleep but I then end up drowsy at work. As a machinist I can't afford to be drowsy so I don't finish a prescription of these very often. I would rather have a cyclic sleep pattern than lose a finger on the job because I'm zoned out on meds. So in that light, I have to try other things, and what I found is that I generally fall asleep when reading a good book. A good book that I get into relaxes me, whereas a lousy book won't.<br>    I have also found that some doctors listen to you only long enough to decide what to prescribe next. I try not to let them just shove pills at me. If you tell a doctor "No, I want an explanation why I need this drug.", he will usually explain, and you can work with him from there in your own best interest. Besides, it can be real funny sometimes to see the look on a doctor's face when you tell him "NO".|`|TaD9OxkLaa	My dr. gave me Ambien for a while, then switched me to Valium. I still have lots of trouble sleeping though...|`|oe3m7NSMaa	Alot of people that have used prescription sleep medications have suffered this problem at one varied point or another in their life, some even more than others such as possibly your case.  However, many do not want to use addictive drugs and that is completely understandable, but I know how to treat insomnia, naturally. For a very economical price you can get a natural melatonin supplement from your local Wal-Mart in the vitamin section which helps your body to produce more natural Serotonin at bed time to enhance sleep. There are zero side effects, other than a good nights sleep, and it is non-habit forming. It is just a great vitamin supplement. <br>  <br>  Search the key word "Melatonin" on your Yahoo search engine to confirm what I'm telling you. It naturally provides me a great nights sleep every night after trying for years to sleep at night before I found this dietary supplement. I wake refreshed and full of energy as I am only promoting my body's own ability to sleep. The best brand comes in a purple bottle from the company "Natrol" and is labeled Melatonin 5mg (1 tablet at night). Again, it is non-narcotic as it is a natural supplement and is found in the vitamin and health section at your local Wal-Mart. It's the best kept secret for sleep I've ever experienced for a great nights sleep every night. By helping the body to produce more Serotonin, which is your body's "chill out" hormone, the Melatonin lowers stress, eases your mind, and thus promotes restful sleep.

318cc58aa371766e29991feb829affc9aa	If you're looking to bulk up muscle mass then you'll need to can the cardio for the time being, especially when done before lifting.<br>  <br>  When in a bulking phase, the idea is to get an excess of calories in the diet in order to build muscle.  Cardio will utilize a lot of the calories needed.  Just ask any serious or competitive bodybuilder if they do cardio during bulking phases and about universally they'll say they don't.  If your diet is correctly programmed then bodyfat gain will be fairly minimal (though a little addition during gaining phases is inevitable).<br>  <br>  If you insist on doing cardio, make sure you do it after weights.  When you do cardio first, it uses up a lot of the glycogen stores so that when you do your weights workout, as soon as those glycogen stores are used up the body will start metabolising muscle tissue for energy, defeating the purpose of weight training.  Also, be sure to get even more calories in your diet in order to compensate for what's used during cardio..<br>  <br>  Another consideration is to do high intensity cardio.  This is a type of cardio a lot of bodybuilders use to lose bodyfat but retain muscle.  It's still not going to be the same as not doing cardio at all, but it's better than traditional cardio.<br>  <br>  For any serious bodybuilder, cardio is used during maintenance or cutting phases, not during gaining phases.|`|9d9wYqwcaa	No You need to do only about 3 cardio sessions a week at no more than 30 minutes at each session. Also, you have to lower the pace alot! Walking very fast or jogging slow will be enough.<br>  <br>  If you want to add 15lbs, try adding 2 lbs per week. That way you dont build up too much bodyfat!
I0WV46yKaa	There aren't really any foods that have been proven to up your meatbolism enough to justify eating junk.  That being said, a combination of a healthy diet (whole grains, lean protein, dairy, lots of fruits & veg) coupled with a well thought out exercise program will boost your metabolism greatly.  I eat a lot (3500-4000 calories per day) and train about 13hrs/week, so it evens out.  But my diet consists almost entirely of fresh, healthy food.  I eat a minimal amount (as little as humanly possible) of any food that comes in a box, bag or wrapper.|`|d4f18a9e043bec96fbf8a5e33e9628eeaa	Blood sugar control is the key to boosting your metabolism.<br>  The best foods, according to nutritionists, are complex carbohydrates such as:<br>  -- whole grains<br>  -- apples<br>  -- oats<br>  -- lean roast chicken<br>  --oranges<br>  -- nuts and seeds<br>  -- skimmed milk<br>  --sunflower seeds<br>  --tofu<br>  --almonds<br>  --soy beans, chick peas<br>  --whole grain pasta<br>  --pumpernickel bread, whole grain breads<br>  --skimmed or low-fat milk<br>  --low fat cottage cheese, yogurt<br>  <br>  <br>  The idea is to keep your blood sugar from spiking and diving, making the type II diabetic diet the one for everyone who wants to lose weight and keep it off<br>  <br>  What you need to do it eat a healthy breakfast within a half hour of rising, a snack, lunch, a snack, supper, and avoid eating within 2 hours of going to bed and drinking 8 glasses of water a day. <br>  <br>  If you check out Mypyramid.gov it gives you the low-down on your diet, your BMI, and a chart on what to eat all day and how many calories it takes to maintain your weight. <br>  <br>  Exercise is key. Walking is the number one way people keep their metabolism rolling and take off the weight, but you can do whatever you find fun as long as you do it at least a half hour a day, whether all at once or in increments.  <br>  <br>  You want most of your nutrition coming from all colors of fruits and vegetables.

6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	hey man, you are kinda like me.  Do this and I promise you that You will see significant improvements.  You can do the same number I can.  This thursday I want you to do a set of 35 pushups and then wait 5 minutes, then do 35 more and 5 minutes rest and finally another set.  Now I want you to go and get a deck of cards and count it out until you have a total of 130 on face value cards.  You should shuffle the deck of cards and then do all of the pushups in one single session without doing anything else, you can resume your life when you are done and that means after every card you need to ge up on your knees and pick up the next card and take a deep breath and do that card and in no time you will be very sore, but there will be excellent results, you should do this once per week. Now wait until monday and then throughout the day see how many pushups you can do.  Before I did this I could only do like 250 in a day but today I did 600.  After the workout on monday wait until wednesday and then do 5 sets of max with 5 minutes in between.  You need to do pushups every other day, I learned that after being stubborn and when I tried it it really worked.  Good luck soldier I will be there soon.|`|ADrYxh5Uaa	push ups steriods and beer  haha no seriously try push ups with your feet elevated they will make you put your feet on your bed and do push ups that way or your feet  on a chair and  put your hand close to each other you know diamond push ups and wide arm push ups or bench presses and pull ups shoulders and chest buddy good luck and god blesss you for going to kick some terrorist beep|`|ICcmwXb7aa	You need to bench press and build your back and triceps then you will see an improvement
b644f34d52c41b3498a7f6b12d45597caa	First of all, a 2 hr workout is too long. After about an hour your body becomes catabolic and starts to break down muscle. You should work out about four times a week with about hour long workouts. Try to incorporate alot of compound exercises into the workouts such as squats, bench, deadlifts, cleans, etc. As far as diet goes consume about six small meals a day with 1 to 1.5 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight. Do high intensity cardio twice a week. Also if you want you can try creatine. Take the powdered form 30min before workouts. Hope this helps.|`|XAOpsYBAaa	okay look eat 4 big meals a day and always eat snacks(protein stuff) in between and work out 5 times a week 3 days on 1 day off then 2 days on 1 day off|`|g0bfKRTuaa	If you really want to build muscle you have to pump some serious iron! When lifting weights you want to do reps quick to rip muscle, for going slow is better for toning. you may want to only work out twice a week to give your self alot of time to rest. Alot of people say to lift everyday but that is not the case because your muscles need time to recover and if you push yourself to much you won't grow muscles well period. Keep on eating lean protein, such as chicken breast and such! I'm into lifting but like endurance exercises more. I usually run two miles a day and bike, but I would say not to run alot in your case because it could sap energy from your muscles making them not have the right amount of nutrients.|`|g2Rlt03oaa	DO WORK SON

AA10478792	Even though the chances are slim I think its possible to at least get some of your hair grow back to normal. I have seborrheic dermatitis.

However, with proper treatment and drastic changes (no more perms, just all natural). I've managed to grow strong and happy hair. My front hair line might be a bit thin but everything else is full and thick. If I stoped treating my hair I'm sure I would lose everything I've worked for hard for.

(I believe the error rate is plus or minus 2 inches)<br>  <br>  If you are between the ages 8 - 16 (female) or 9-18 (male) and are white causcasian...these results will more accurate.<br>  <br>  First, you need to take as accurate a measurement as possible of your height, your sitting height and your weight. Then, go the website I entered as my source and put in the data and it will calculate their prediction. You'll also need to enter your birthdate.<br>  <br>  Your sitting height is basically the height of your torso. When your sitting down on a hard surface, have someone measure the height from your bum to the top of your head while you are sitting up straight. Keep your head level, looking forward.<br>  <br>  The error of plus or minus 2 inches means that if the result is 68 inches, you could still end up being 66 inches or even 70 inches. Also, this is just the normal variation. You could fall out of that range. The end result is that no one really knows, but we can make a good guess.|`|JKr1meszaa	There is no way , N .

But go 14 days from the first day of her period and that is the main day, but they do say it can happen anytime and if you two are really trying expand it a few days before and after.  Good Luck with that though!|`|3777c483c023e51cc42ff7b04b11d878aa	Maybe you should think about getting married first.Maybe you should check your financial status to see if you can afford a baby second.Do you own your own home?Rent?Live with mama?Do you own a car?Some form of transportation?

Yo por eso recomiendo que si me desmayo me hable y traten de despertarme para que pueda reaccionar.

La imagen la ves en 3D y después todo se oscurece y da vueltas. Cuando te despiertas tu cuerpo está lleno de un sudor frio y pálida como la leche, sigues aturdida hasta que te recuperas.

Se que no se puede poner de pie o incorporar a una persona porque de hecho podes hacerla morir, el desmayo es una defensa del organismo cuando no hay suficiente irrigacion sanguinea en el cerebro, asi te hace "dormir" porque en esa pose la sangre circula en forma uniforme, si incorporas a la persona, evitaras que la sangre se irrigue al cerebro y puedes hacer que sus neuronas mueran, nunca lo hagas! Un desmayo puede darse por bajas de presión, alimentacion indebida o escasa, grandes tensiones o emociones, o por un gran dolor o golpe.

I take Effexor XR for this and it's been a  life-saver. I would visit your doctor and see what he/she could recommend. The same medications won't work for everyone, but I haven't had a full panic attack in about five years, although you never forget what they feel like.<br>  <br>  The link I sent you below talks about what panic attacks are and there's even a quiz you can take to find out if what you've been having are truly panic attacks, although they definitely sound like them to me.

AA10341992	You sound very confident to me. Give yourself credit for knowing who you are. Weight can be handled. I know it's hard to eat less and exercise a bit, but really, we all know (unless there is a medical issue) how to take some weight off. If your therapist is not helping, please, know that you have a right to find a new one. Please look in to this. The old therapist will understand. You can say, "I am commited to therapy, but I feel that for the work I need to do, I need to seek a new point of view." Confidence, at its core, comes from feeling solid, yes? Find a few things to work on, don't try and fix everything at once. You'll get there. I have found it is very helpful to help other people. Not your friends etc, I mean volunteer work. It's such a blessing to help those in need, and it makes you feel good. That will help you also get "out of your own head", and be valuable to other people. I know it's hard and you're in alot of pain, but you sound like you've made a lot of progress already... simply assessing, honestly, how you feel, and how you'd like your life to feel. Not sure if you have a sport you like, or if you have access to a gym, but I found that feeling physically stronger was a big step toward then feeling mentally strong.

6a18eae83ffd71ef0dd9d1d4e8adf7a8aa	Call your local Planned Parenthood to find all this information out.  They will tell you what you need to bring.  Go to www.plannedparenthood.org.  At the top you can type in your zip code and it will tell you the phone number to your local PP.  <br>  <br>  I can answer some of your questions.  Every PP is different.  Typically they do not have Yaz.  The reason for this is Yaz has a hormone called DRSP which can hurt people with renal disease.  Since PP does check for renal disease they tend not to give it.  It is also expensive and PP relys on a lot of donations so they tend to give out what they can either afford or what is given to them by drug companies.  They will be able to give you something like Yaz though!<br>  <br>  I am not sure of your age, but they will not give you a pap smear if you are a virgin.  Many girls are confused on what a a Pap smear is.  A Pap smear is when the doctor or nurse inserts Q-tip like applicater and scrapes cells from ther cervix to test for HPV or cervical cancer.  However, if you get an exam without a Pap smear, the doctor will still examine your genitals and insert a speculum into your vagina to make sure everything is normal.  If you want a gonorhea and chylamdia test, she will still insert a q-tip into the vagina to test for those STDs, that is not a pap smear it is just a different type of test.<br>  <br>  You need some sort of ID. Your HS id might work.

3V98ONgRaa	i strongly suggest valerian root. it's great at relieving stress and tension! you can get it over the counter and it's a great sleep aid! if you have one of those "racing minds" or "i can't turn my head off no matter how tired i am" then this will definitely help. you can find at your local grocery store in the pharmacy or herbal remedy section. start off taking 500-1000mgs, 30-45 minutes before you go to bed. now you can get this stuff in capsule form and it's 100% safe (my whole family has been taking it for years and our family doctor actually recommended it) however the only downside is that the more potent the brand your taking the stronger the smell. and this stuff smells AWFUL! but it's worth it. within 5-7 days you should notice a definite change in your sleep. <br>  <br>  WARNING! i strongly do not suggest that you take Tylenol PM and booze, in any form or combination. the main ingredient in Tylenol PM and Advil pm, or benadryl for that matter is diphenhydramine. here's what happens when you take it:<br>  You can walk into a drugstore and choose from an array of sleep aids, offered without prescription. The main ingredient of over-the-counter sleeping pills is an antihistamine. Antihistamines are generally taken for allergies, but also make you feel very sleepy. Common over-the-counter sleep medications are Sleep-Eze, Sominex, Nytol, and Unison; they contain antihistamines such as:<br>  <br>  diphenhydramine hydrochloride, <br>  diphenhydramine citrate, or <br>  doxylamine succinate. <br>  In general, over-the-counter sleep medications are not a good choice because they:<br>  <br>  Are not intended for long-term use. <br>  Interfere with mental alertness during the day, so you should avoid driving and other similar tasks. You may also be at risk for falling asleep<br>  Reduce the quality of your sleep by reducing time you spend in deep sleep. <br>  Use over-the-counter sleep medications only for transient or short-term insomnia and in conjunction with changes to your sleeping habits. Be sure to pay attention to your body’s physical response to these sleep medications.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps|`|0841c7c0f9ce722c1d8e3a20b07fddd5aa	You should not eat for about 2 hours before going to bed, make sure you are comfortable, read a book in bed and when you feel sleepy go to sleep, clear your mind and think of the ocean,forest or what makes you happy, some thing relaxing.<br>  Good luck|`|79fd8052579006f59f01afcfbf72e82baa	i have tried 2 kinds of sleep medicines that are prescriptions- ambien and lunesta. i liked the ambien better. now, if you don't want to do that, i have heard warm milk, or there is a herbal tea called sleepytime. for the ambien, you have to be by your bed, cause when you take it, it will put you to sleep. i have the same problem, it takes me a hour too. try these and let me know, i haven't tried the warm milk, to me, that is just too gross.|`|8huvl1Q0aa	I know the feeling.  <br>  <br>  Keep away from all caffine even tea at least 6 hours before bed, have a warm shower pat your skin dry not rub,  warm milk, and sometimes classical music in the background will help me.  I also like to read a not to exciting book.  <br>  <br>  If it gets to bad see the dr, as you can suffer from sleep Depravation.|`|Q4jmMi33aa	Have some hot tea or a warm drink before you go to sleep.  There are a lot of things, maybe you have too many things in your mind. Well, I have been having the same problems. I have been drinking warm tea at night and that helps. Its probably anxiety or maybe you need to talk to a professional your doctor to see what he recommends, but do not take sleeping pills. They are so so so dangerous. Good Luck|`|RV4GD1llaa	nope|`|AA10202179	Assuming you're looking for a non-chemical way to get to sleep...then there are a number of things you can try, until you find what works for you. <br>  <br>  A few slices of turkey might help relax you...a glass of milk...<br>  <br>  Focusing on something in your room like a doorknob, and thinking only about that, can calm your thoughts and help you relax...<br>  <br>  Slowly clench and unclench your muscles, starting with your feet, and working your way up.  <br>  <br>  Focus on breathing, and repeat a simple mantra (sleep is good, the air is cool, whatever works for you). This is the one that often works for me if I wake up in the middle of the night and my brain kicks into gear.<br>  <br>  Create a cool-down routine before bed that lets your body and mind gear down. Systematically strip away all the stuff of the day, internally and externally.<br>  <br>  Pray or meditate.|`|ESQ18T5maa	You may be having a case of insomnia, or inability to sleep. I would ask your doctor for possible remedies but what has worked for me is really soft symphony music and warm water/tea before bed.|`|k5IUoYJpaa	Yes, I do have advice for you. This type of trouble sleeping is typically caused by anxiety. In addition to addressing any issues that you may be experiencing anxiety over, you can take Benadryl 25-50mg (1-2 tablets) 30minutes to an hour prior to desired sleep. That will not put you into such a deep sleep that you will miss your alarm clock, but it will give you just enough drowsiness to get to sleep when you want to. Benadryl is also called Diphenhydramine, and is the active ingredient in "Tylenol P.M." for inducing sleep. Thanks.|`|rEIcHDVQaa	I had the same problem about a year ago, and my doctor recommended taking a Melatonin Supplement. Melatonin is a hormone released from the pineal gland each night to help us sleep. Melatonin secretion is enhanced in darkness and decreased by light exposure. So if you increase the Melatonin by taking a supplement, it assist with you falling asleep.  The link I provided gives excellent information on it, including the benefits and the very limited side affects (which they say can be prevented by taking lower doses).  It can be purchased at Wal-mart for about 3 or 4 dollars.  I wake up refreshed and have no problems sleeping if I take it about an hour before bed.  Hope this helps.

Ways you  keep your eyes in the sun, without sunglasses, Or maybe your touching your eye with something dirty. Using dirty contacts that may irritate the eye. Or getting pink eye and not taking care of it. many many ways of making your eye sight get worse. But remember most of these take time to happen.

qyLoXR6haa	i also had kidney stones. i was told to drink lots and lots of water and keep moving. Lying in bed doesn't help at all. By the third day i had enough. I got up and drank a large glass of water, vacuumed my living room, drank another large glass of water, vacuumed my bedroom, drank another large glass of water, swept and mopped my kitchen, did the same for the bathroom. also did laundry, hanging some outside, instead of putting in dryer. of course, i peed when i felt the need. started this about 8:30 a.m. and about 2:30 p.m., i passed the stone. <br>  the trick is to drink lots and lots of water and keep moving. walking didn't do much, but the strenuous activity of bending at the waist and sweeping motion seemed to do the trick. of course, i did take a pain pill before i started all of this.|`|NgF0t3NPaa	My father have had that kind of paid .

1wGZgYrUaa	I've been on it for a year for anxiety.  It did take a while to start working.  I think somewhere around a month.  It works slowly and it's not very dramatic.  The only way I could tell if it was working would be to skip a dose and see how I felt.  Don't do this..it's never good.  This caused me to have severe anxiety.  My best advice is to have patience with it and take it regularly.|`|2dad99d9755b103970df691b47977f67aa	I was on lexapro for a few months and had a very bad time with it, increased depression and thoughts of suicide so I needed to stop. But I believe that is rare because I know someone who was on it for quite a while and not only did the anxiety and depression go away within a few weeks but she tolerated it very well. So I would give it 2-3 weeks and if there isnt a noticable change talk to your Dr about it.|`|1EO5SROqaa	What strength are you on?  It comes in 10 and 20 mg.  You do need to stay on it for a while to get the full benefit of the medication.   It can be dosed up to 30mg once a day.<br>  <br>  Give it a fair trial.  If it then still doesn't work, then there are many other drugs in this category called SSRIs that you can try.  The other option is to add another antidepressant that works on other neurotrammiters like dopamine and norepinephrine so that they complement each other's effect. <br>  <br>  For the anxiety, you can also add on a benzodiaxepines when you needed.|`|867a43fea0f7a3a51a958c423b653cc8aa	I've taken it give it a few weeks

Both you and your GP will explore your pharmacological options in managing your OCD and the goal is to come out with the plan that suits you best. remember each presentation of a condition like OCD is different and some times satisfactory results have been achieved by employing different classes of drugs other than the ones normaly prescribed for this condition
cNnkEibGaa	Go to the link that the person provided about the Don Joy braces. I think they are the best. You will be on crutches for a very short time because you will start doing PT and they want you to get your range of motion back quickly. The brace will be on longer. Crutches can be kind of fun..really not a problem. You can get really good very quickly, and get around very fast. Stairs are a pain, but then you just use one and the banister on the other side. Give someone the other crutch..they will think that's cool. You really have nothing to worry about..remember the doctor and the PT work for YOU! You have a young knee..really you will be fine, and feel really dumb with all the worrying. Just start taking care of business and that will take your mind off it. Once you know the program, then you can pick something else to worry about. Like what outfits will look the coolest with a knee brace:} Get some cool stickers or something to accessorize the brace. Honestly, you will get more attention from guys than you ever thought possible. You're not old enough to drive, so that isn't an issue. You're an athlete..athlete's get injured. That is part of the deal..this is your first injury..it won't be the last. You broke it..they will fix it..simple. Just like a car. Call your volley ball coach..she may know someone, and can be a good support for you.|`|Wm1JL4ETaa	You might be on crutches for a short time but why are you worried?

7fYlL8tUaa	there is also swimming that tones muscle though but i think pliates and yoga are the best way to get long lean muscle|`|Vsga7eivaa	I'm sorry but the facts are simple.<br>  <br>  - Pilates and resistance training both put stress on muscles.<br>  - Putting stress on muscles causes them to grow<br>  - You cannot choose how a muscle is going to grow, just like you cannot choose how you yourself will grow.<br>  - Practicing stretching exercises will probably cause your muscles to be in a more stretched out and less bulky state when resting.<br>  - There is NO scientific evidence that shows pilates or resistance training as producing more lean muscles rather than bulky.  At the end of the day, if you exercise your muscles, they will get more bulky.
ilvln8VMaa	You have to eat more calories than you burn so you don't loose weight.  Weight training is good for bulking up and body shaping. More weight and less reps for bulky muscles; less weight and more weight for lean elongated muscles. Get some professional training to learn proper techniques to avoid injury.

Also, once you get fat, your large stomach will make your breast look even smaller. I used to be stark skinny and people made fun of me. Those same people make fun of me now because I'm a size 10 in pants (I'm still small up top). You can't please people. As long as you have a healthy BMI and a healthy body fat percentage you will have a beautiful body. Believe me, trying to get fat is not the answer and you will regret trying to get fat when you are 23 and you find that you can't lose the weight easily.

At first I couldn't believe that I could lose that much in so little time until i read this article <br>  <br>  www.losew8fast.blogspot.com|`|81ff98a2b59a7150ffd94a3f4604b9e1aa	For the VERY easiest solution, go to: <br>  <br>  www.plumfieldgardens<br>  .wholefoodfarmacy.com<br>  <br>  (I had to write it on two lines, since the last part of the address disappeared when I previewed it) <br>  <br>  One lady lost 308 lbs in less than a year by eating their premiere whole food mix, "Phi Plus."  <br>  <br>  You can also do one of their Tri-Decathlon programs, which is a mix of Phi Plus, Fruitalicious and Veggielicious.  All come in convenient, re-sealable bags and are stored at room temperature.  <br>  <br>  Their super-cleansing and balancing event is called the Liquithon, and it consists of a series of "farinas" or powders to mix into water or juice, and each designed to bring different body systems into balance.  <br>  <br>  Wholefood Farmacy offers totally convenient whole foods, all plant-based, and most of them raw/dehydrated at low temp/low pressure.  Only the corn they use in their corn-based products is roasted.  <br>  <br>  The foods cleanse while nourishing. I can't think of an easier way to make sure that every meal can be a vegan meal, no matter where you are, and provide great vegan "nosh" for movie night or car-snacking.  <br>  <br>  As with any raw food program, depending on your weight to start, it is possible to lose rather spectacular amounts of weight as you release toxins, old residue from the colon, extra water as you create a healthier and more alkaline environment in your body, and yes, real body fat.  <br>  <br>  For embracing the raw lifestyle, you might also try.....<br>  <br>  www.frederickpatenaude.com<br>  <br>  He also promotes several programs for making the raw transition.  He's got a free email newsletter with recipes on a regular basis, too.  <br>  <br>  Lots of great, easy advice through www.gogreen.org, too. I built my automatic sprouter from her instructions and it worked GREAT, just like she said it would.  I had inexpensive, fresh sprouts every day!<br>  <br>  There is also a book you might be interested in called "Raw Food Made Easy...for just 1 or 2 people" by Jennifer Cornbleet.

ScbLCXk6aa	Liposuction surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Tour2india4health Consultants .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.<br>  <br>  Tour2india4health Consultants is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tour2india4health.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tour2india4health.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|ubdlR0Vnaa	There's also laser liposuction or smartlipo.

I would get LIPOSCULPTURE.  It's safer because you don't get put under for the procedure so you won't have any issues with anethesia and all that.  Plus, liposculpture is more for spot reducing and all, not weight loss; you sound like you're at a good weight!  I had mine done by Dr. Hall in Scottsdale and it was AWESOME!!  The practice is called Infini Cosmetics and Dr. Hall is really well known in the Valley.  So if you decide to do this, I'd go for liposculpture, not liposuction definitely.

If you are ectomorph and want to get larger, focus on big compound exercises.  I would do two workouts a week(yes 2 workouts):<br>  <br>  I.  Bench Press (2 warmup sets and 2 work sets)<br>      Deadlift (3 warmup sets and 2 work sets)<br>      <br>  <br>  II.  Standing Military Press(2 warmups and 2 work sets)<br>       Squats(3 warmups and 2 work sets)<br>       Pullups (if you can do more than 10 hold a weight)<br>  <br>  Stay away from creatine, you have to keep taking it forever for it to continue working.  Spend your money on a girlfriend and good food.|`|a00ea0e0bb4919e576f19e8d0ca684a5aa	Seems alright.  The only thing I would change is possibly throwing in a "max out day".  Where you increase the weight and decrease the reps.  When you do the same routine everyday, your body figures out ways to trick itself into getting the work done without much improvement.  When you realize that muscles are built by the tearing and re-mending of the muscle itself, you can see why the body would want to do this.<br>  <br>  Good luck, try not to rely on the creatine if you are going to be entering an athletic season.  While it helps with muscle recovery, it leads to heavy cramping and damage to organs like the kidney and liver.|`|Up5LzCquaa	You really need to change your ways, by looking at this routine you are seriously slowing down your gains..<br>  <br>  1) By doing bench press on one day and doing close grip bench press the other day, you are not giving beneficent time for your muscles to repair, and are hitting the chest muscles again by doing close grip bench press. When you do bench your triceps are worked a lot, and when you do close grip on the second day you work your triceps hard again. <br>  <br>  So only do bench and triceps in one day.<br>  <br>  Do legs and biceps on the other day. Do other bicep exercises as well as hammer curls. <br>  <br>  Also, i hope you are taking a whey protein supplement with creatine because without one its uselus. Make sure you purchase one. If you want to see faster results with creatine i.e in 2 weeks you should go on a loading phase, take 20g every day in 5g servings every day for 5 days to get the muscle saturated. Then take 5 g every day from then on. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
hW0PbGZdaa	First, go to a site like the one below to find out how many calories you need to take in just to maintain your weight and then consume about 300 less.  Don't forget to take into account the calories you will be burning from your workouts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reply42.com/metabolism/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.reply42.com/metabolism/index....</a><br>  <br>  It is good that you are already running, you may want to consider interval training to your cardio sessions.  For example run at 70-90% intensity for a minute then  jog briskly for about a minute and repeat about 6-10 times.  Interval training burns more fat and calories that just plain old running in less time.  <br>  <br>  Also, to get rid of those last 5-10 lbs you need to be really zealous in patrolling your food intake.  Take a day to cheat, but six days a week watch what you eat carefully.

I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too! I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of impurities. Impurities come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things. The impurities get stored in the fat in our body. To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the impurities by cleansing the body. This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked. The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast. If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website. This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

Do not be in a hurry.|`|zC0XLym5aa	Do Crunches. Lie on the floor (with or without a mat). Cross your arms in front of your chest. (Donot place both hands behind your head. Placing both hands behind your head can cause lower back problems in the long run as it places unnecessary stress on that part of your body from pulling on your head and neck.) Another alternative to crossing your arms in front of your chest is to lightly place your finger tips behind your ears, without pulling on your neck or ears to help raise you off the floor. Draw in your abdomen towards your spine while inhaling through your nose. Now raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off of the floor. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor exhale through your mouth, ending with a gasp once your shoulders are off the floor. Then pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. The proper breathing and flexing make all the difference. Now lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground and repeat. <br>  <br>  Do Sit Ups. Lie on the floor, feet on the floor, knees up and hands behind your head or crossed on your chest. Sit all the way up, lifting your lower back off the floor along with your shoulder blades. Lower yourself down. Repeat. Once this becomes relatively easy for you (i.e. you can do a quite a bit with ease) start adding more challenges. Find an incline bench or do these on an exercise ball. Once you "graduate" from that, do weighted sit ups. Hold a weight on your chest while you do these. As these become easier, hold heavier and heavier weights. You might also try lifting your feet off the ground while doing the sit ups or alternating the leg in the air, like pretending to pedal while sitting up. If your hands are behind your head, bring your left knee up to touch your right elbow and then your right knee to the left elbow. <br>  Do Leg Lifts. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a ninety degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar. Still too easy?... <br>  Do Jackknife Sit Ups. Lie down flat on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. "spread out") and repeat. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it. What's that? More? <br>  Do V-ups. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands on the floor but this time extended out over your head. Simultaneously raise legs and torso. Don't bend your knees! What kind of V would it be if you bend your knees? Reach with your hands toward the raised feet. Touch your feet if possible (might require some flexibility). Relax, return to starting position and repeat. Add weight between feet to match your taste. <br>  Static Hold and Side Statics. Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and you whole body flat. This position is known as the static hold position and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place which is the real purpose of your abs. Hold this position for as long as possible, but you should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers known to achieve over 20 minute static holds. To perform the side static hold roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before, but this time only one arm will be on the ground with the other arm pointed straight up the air and your non-weight bearing leg resting on your bottom leg. Once again, hold this for as long as possible <br>  Train Your Oblique Muscles. It's not as important to work on your oblique muscles at first, but eventually you'll want to start working these too. These are the muscles to either side of your stomach. There are multiple ways to do this and anything that includes twisting your torso against a resistance counts. There are twisting machines at gyms, you can twist while you do sit-ups, you can do side bends, you can twist side to side with a medicine ball in hand, etc. Be aware though, that many beginners tend to have weak obliques compared to their abs (it simply isn't used as much in daily life) so go easy on the sides at first. <br>  Other stuff Since it is, literally, the center of your body there are many other tricks you can use to train your abs, and some of the other movements will more or less involve your abs. Including every abdominal exercise in existence would make this article painfully long and new methods are being developed constantly. Now that you've made up your mind about a washboard mid-section, get creative! Find new ways to crunch, bend and twist in your daily life. Some possibilities include: <br>  Use a stability ball. Do your crunches on the ball to introduce instability to your workout, which will improve your balance too. There are also lots of core exercises that can be done with a stability ball.You can also use a small bubble use for physical therapy. <br>  Duck and twist during your daily routine. Reach with your left hand to things on your right and vice versa. If you feel like turning around to face something, see if you can do it with keeping your hips in place and twisting at the waist (warning: awkward when talking to other people, use only against inanimate objects). While walking or standing, pretend that something is coming toward you and you have to duck to get out of the way. Do this as often as you are comfortable or at times when it won't look weird. You can bend forward from the hips or, if you're really into it, bend at the knees too and really "sink" out of the way. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Weights. The more muscle your body has, the more calories your body burns, even at rest. Many people are afraid of getting huge due to weight lifting. This is meaningless. You will NOT gain a lot of mass if you're not taking in a lot of calories as well. Also keep in mind that most of the huge people you see on TV or in print achieve that state by going on high protein and high carb diets. They increase their calorie intake specifically to bulk up. So the fear of bulking up should NOT be a reason to not lift weights. As a rule of thumb, the larger the muscle the more energy it will burn to sustain itself. Therefore the most effective muscle groups to work for fat loss are large muscle groups: thighs and hamstrings, the back, and the chest. You can also lift your body weight without going to a gym, through push ups, sit ups, chin ups, etc. <br>  <br>  Do Cardio. No matter how muscular your abs are that six pack isn't going to show if you cover it up with a layer of fat. Running, biking, swimming, stair climbing, jumping rope, tennis, volleyball, dancing, squash or any other activity that gets you moving and keeps you moving is a great way to burn fat. However, a cardio workout should be performed for at least 20 MINUTES to burn fat. Prior to this your body will simply run on its stored energy, which results in minimal fat loss. Cardio should always be done after your weight lifting workout. While lifting weights, you use stored, (carb) energy, thus, by doing cardio after weight training your body will have less stored energy to use and go straight into the fat storage for its energy use. The overall best way to shed fat fast is to do cardio(30 min minimum) right when you wake up. Your body will search for energy to use, when it finds nothing in your stomach, it will go directly to your fat storage for energy and the fat will burn up so fast! <br>  Diet Tips<br>  <br>  Keep Metabolism Steady. Eating one small meal (such as a potato, a salad, etc.) every three hours that you are awake will not speed up your metabolism, rather, it will keep it going. Your metabolism goes and slows with your food intake and eating something small every three hours will keep that metabolism burning calories and will help you lose weight. <br>  Eat Smaller Dinners. Cut down on the size of your dinner. If you're hungry, snack on fruits or other healthy, low calorie snacks. Large dinners tend to hurt a fat loss process because most people aren't very active after dinner. This is the basis for advice along the lines of "don't eat anything within X hours before going to bed". The claim that your entire dinner is stored as fat isn't entirely true (the process is more complicated than that) but the fact you don't move after dinner is enough to hurt your cause. You can offset this by eating a larger lunch or snacking healthily before dinner. Fresh fruits or vegetables are excellent choices for curbing appetite not to mention other health benefits. A handful of nuts might do the same. Drink a large glass of water before sitting at the table. <br>  Eat More Fiber. Most people don't get enough fiber. The recommended amount is actually not that much if you eat a healthy diet. "Fiber foods" include whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds. Other options are fiber supplements. <br>  Eat Breakfast. Many people skip breakfast because they don't have time for it. Keep this in mind: You don't have time to skip breakfast, it's simply too valuable to skip. The fact that skipping breakfast messes up your concentration and other mental functions is beyond the scope of this article. The harm of skipping breakfast from a weight loss perspective is it makes you eat a huge lunch since your body hasn't had anything in the past 12 (or more) hours. When you eat a huge lunch you get that after meal drowsiness so now you're both unproductive and inactive. Cereals don't take much time to prepare and consume, and most of them are very healthy nowadays. If you are extremely pressed for time, consider grabbing a box of breakfast bars or a smoothie and throwing one in your bag when you leave for work or school. Some breakfast bars out there are also excellent sources of fiber. <br>  Eat Smaller Meals More Frequently. This helps raise your metabolism too. It's not easy to do though since it's a relatively big change to most people's routines. But it doesn't have to be a full blown meal, simply eat often but less. A jar of nuts in the office will do just fine, grab a handful when you feel like it. Most fruits can last for a couple days without refrigeration, and if you have a refrigerator at the office, make use of it. <br>  <br>  Drink More Water Everyday. Many places suggest 8 cups (2 L) of water a day. It sounds like an absurd amount of water, but actually, you can drink tea without sugar to make up some of the quota. In fact tea, especially green tea, rev up your "metabolism" (actually cause a temporary increase in calories burned).<br>  For fat loss purposes, it is important to remind yourself that thirst is a much weaker stimuli than hunger. If you consistantly feel hungry after meals, don't immediately think that you need to eat more. You may simply be thirsty!<br>  Needless to say there are many benefits of water. 69% of your body is made of it! <br>  We can exist without food for months, but without water we can only survive for a few days. Your body is made up mostly of water, which: <br>  <br>  Is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption and elimination <br>  Aids circulation <br>  Helps control the body's temperature <br>  Lubricates and cushions joints <br>  Keeps the skin healthy <br>  Helps remove toxins from your body <br>  Every day you lose water from the body through urine and sweat, and this fluid needs to be replenished. However, your body has come equipped with a mechanism that tells you when you need to replenish your supply--it’s called thirst!<br>  <br>  Drinking water is good for you. It will not make you fat, if you drink 8 glasses a day or even 15. Just dont drink too much more than that.|`|2s3MyqrAaa	if you really want to lose your weight don't worry.exercise daily with some hard workouts,drink fresh jucies.if you want more details visit the below website.|`|YNhDHspbaa	try cutting out eating for a day or two and move away from the tv or better still get rid of the tv and the car if you have one and walk a bit.|`|YS4EFDE8aa	Read the following. It works.<br>  Here's a serious answer. I hope it helps.<br>  I think it would help if you could have a change in your way of thinking. A more positive attitude will help you feel better and get healthy faster. Using affirmations is one way to change your mind. I have used the following affirmation with some of my clients and they did very well. ''I, (say your name), am at my perfect weight. I look and feel fantastic.'' Write that down 21 times a day for 21 days. Start telling yourself positive things about yourself like, ''I am getting better and better every day!'' or ''Everything I eat makes me thin and healthy.''<br>  This will help. If you have negative thoughts when you write down the affirmation, write down everything that comes into your mind. Then write down the affirmation again. After a while your mind will start to agree with you.<br>  Also, you need to eat healthy and exercise. Following is my standard answer to everyone who wants to lose weight. It's a lot of information but I'm sure it will help you. Good luck with your goal! You can do it.<br>  <br>  *If want to get fit and/or lose weight, here's my Weight Loss Program through Body Building and Nutrition. It works! First, don't Use Diet Pills. They are bad for you. Most of them are just a scam or they are addictive. Counting calories is a pain in the neck. It will drive you nuts. But, losing weight is simple. You just have to do the right things. <br>  *(If you are older and have not exercised in many years you should see your doctor and have a stress test done to be sure your heart is ok before starting this program. Also, walking eveyday is a good lifelong practice.)<br>  *Fad diets sometimes work but, you can be sure that at least 25% of the weight you lose will be muscle. Then when you stop the diet you will gain back all of the weight you lost but no muscle. So, you will have 25% more fat than you did before! Fad diets just aren't worth the bother. <br>  *Fasting or skipping meals will teach your body that famine is common in your world and your body will begin to store more fat to get you through the next period when food is not available. It's better to eat healthy foods often to teach your body that food is plentiful and that there is no need to store calories as fat. Eat a vegetablw or frui every two hours.<br>  *Here's a simple trick that can help you lose weight without doing anything else. Drink a litre of water as soon as you wake up in the morning and then drink two more throughout the day. You'll notice a difference the first month. <br>  *Here's another trick that works. For every pound of muscle that you add, your body will burn 3000 calories (1lb) of fat every day. That means that just by having an extra pound of muscle on your body you will burn a pound of fat every day! So, add muscle! <br>  *This is the fastest way to add a pound of muscle. Squats and Pushups! You do them on alternate days; squats one day, pushups the next. And you do them SuperSlow style. That is, you do the easy part twice as slow as the hard part. That way you fatigue the muscles quickly. Then you rest the muscles for 48 hours which gives the body a chance to make new muscles. <br>  *Squats should be done with a wide stance and all the way to the floor. Pushups the with palms shoulder width apart and all the way to the floor, then all the way up. Use the full range of motion of the muscle group you are trying to develop. If you are too weak to do pushups, try them with your knees on the floor or do them with your feet on the floor and your hands an the bed.<br>  *The idea is to tire the muscles out completely so do a set of squats until you can't do another, then rest for a couple of minutes and do it again. Do that 3 times and you're done for the day. The following day, don't do squats but do pushups. Do them the same way, going down twice as slow as you come up. <br>  *You will lose weight fast, unless you add more junk food and fat to your diet. Instead, eat at least 5 to 7 different raw vegetables and fruits every day. Cut out anything that comes in a bag, box, can, bottle or any kind of package. In other words, cut out all processed foods, soft drinks and sweets. Eat more grains and less red meat. Check out the Food Pyramid.<br>  *If you really want to give your body the best possible chance to be healthy and fat free, go to infinity2.com (Link at bottom of page) and order their weight loss formula and Essentials for Life. That will give you all the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and probiotics that your body needs and will keep you feeling better and healthier. They also have a Proteabolic Mass Formula for serious athletes who want to build muscle mass quickly and safely. <br>  *Weight loss without exercise is not good. You need to eat healthy, exercise and get your rest. You will feel better, look better and be healthier. Try it for a week. You will notice a difference. You will feel better and that will motivate you to continue. <br>  *Losing weight only in specific areas of the body is impossible. You can't just lose weight around the belly, for instance. So, if you want tight, rippled abs, do crunches and leg raises every other day the way I described above. <br>  *One last point, stretching is essential for a number of reasons. Pick up a copy of ''Stretching'' by Bob Anderson. Read the intro and understand his reasoning before you do the exercisis. Good luck!<br>  *This information is based on my personal and professional experience. <br>  *Check these links: <br>  <a href="http://www5to20aday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www5to20aday.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/food_guide_..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/food_guide_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.infinity2.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.infinity2.com</a> Sponsor ID 3290988|`|97CmutyGaa	lmao!

They do not know what the f*ck they are talking about.<br>  <br>  You need to burn fat, not tone up. And you clearly have a LOT of fat to burn.<br>  <br>  Crunches burn off about as many calories as chewing a peice of gum. Do you think this will lose you weight considering there are 3500 calories in one pound (454g) of human body fat? I didn't think so.<br>  <br>  Please relise it is physically impossible to spot reduce fat and no silly diet/quick fix will help or work. You will lose fat equally from all over your body. <br>  <br>  To lose weight is pretty simple: eat healthy and do regular, vigorous exercise.<br>  <br>  Drop your calorie intake to 1500 calories per day. No more. No less. Eat wholemeal foods, lean meats/dairy products, nuts, seeds, fruit and veg.<br>  <br>  Then go to the gym 3-5 times per week. Do some weights to begin - spend 30-45 mins doing this. Now spend a further 45-60mins doing some intense CV. You want to get your heart rate into the 150-170bpm range when doing your CV. This is the fat burning range.<br>  <br>  Go and join a gym and get an instructor to draw up a plan. Please note this is the ONLY realistic way to lose weight. If anyone tells you any different they need their heads checking.<br>  <br>  Realise it takes time and commitment. If you don't think you can do the above, then please just be happy being Mrs Blobby.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

s7u2E6yuaa	The best plan for weight loss, in my opinion is to:<br>  <br>  1) Balance your diet (ommiting foods high in trans fat) and eating in moderation, and making an effort to include foods from the food groups. The most managable way to do this effectively without getting too infatuated is to refrain from eating fatty foods.<br>  <br>  2) The best form of exercise is swimming. It not only burns calories, fast, but relaxes you psychologically, builds up lung capacity, and works out your entire body.<br>  <br>  With regard to your 100 sit-ups, if you did that daily for 3 months, and didn't notice any results, then a possible imbalance could have potentially occured with your body (poor muscle memory, lack of consistency, or even improper dieting).<br>  <br>  The key fact with loosing weight is that one must be fully dedicated to loosing the weight and it all boils down to one thing: CONSISTENCY.<br>  <br>  For example, the bodies abdominal muscles naturally have a six pack. However, body fat can accumulate and hinder in the bodies natural configuration.<br>  <br>  For other tips and workout/dieting see this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fullfitness.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fullfitness.net/</a><br>  <br>  Finally, vomiting as a mean of loosing weight has several ramifications if pursued. This can potentially lead to phsycholigical problems like OCD, Bulimia, Anorexia Nervosa, and has high risks of damaging the body physically. For example physically it can cause poisining, brain tumors, gastritis (imflammation of stomach lining), or even icranial pressure which can cause irregularities in the way the brain circulates blood. Please don't continue voluntarily vomiting<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped.|`|zCmY8jLDaa	Losing weight is a simple equation: if you burn more calories than you eat, the weight will come off. Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the calorie calculator <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/caloriecalclb.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...</a>  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Beginners Guide to Dieting  - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/begdieting.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/b...</a>|`|1aSU7ifSaa	Amazing Weight Loss!!<br>  Lose weight fast and effortlessly using the latest technology. <br>  Its not a diet or a pill.

And you already started to think about your nutrition. That's an important step. It is too easy just to make a magazine-diet for 2-3 weeks and loose some weight. But it will come back soon again. If you are over-thinking your nutrition and activity, you will have a constantly good result.

df8iZR3Laa	simple ok this is a trick from the military.  Walk around with a hat on, pull it down so the brim is literally right on top of your eyebrows and do this for a few months straight. By doing this it will force you to keep your head up, no slouching and you'll have to look under the brim. You might feel stupid but it works. Remember, chest out head up and back and swing your arms, normal people don't keep their arms straight down while walking unless they are lurch from the adams family.|`|uC75y83Taa	Stand as if there's a hook coming out of the top of your head.

pOSaFX0Naa	When did these accidents happen? If this was recent, then there's a chance to get the blood clot from her finger. A first aid maneuver you can do is to heat up a pin and stick the hot tip on to the middle of the fingernail with the blood clot. Repeat this until the hot tip gets through the fingernail and the blood oozes out. Make sure you apply a topical antibiotic after and she doesn't wet her finger for 24 hrs after.<br>  <br>  As for the head bruise, if the accident happened several days ago, apply hot compress to help improve circulation in the area and to hasten the resolution of the bruise. If your mom has some discoloration around her eyes, that's common after a substantial head injury and should resolve in time.|`|fdnANHlaaa	Mmmm. How long has it been? If it has been just a couple of days, you can try icing to minimise the swelling and its pain. Some painkillers every 3-4 hours can help too. Other things that you can consider is that elevating the affected limbs when she's at rest/static position e.g. raising her thumb above the level of the heart, to encourage backflow of blood and limiting swelling also. For the thumb, please help to check if there is a droop at the thumb at its joint, if there is, please take her and see a doctor and get a referral to a hand occupational therapist, it may be a mallet injury (tendon rupture). Hope this helps!

Like anxiety, frustration, etc...<br>  I'm an adult that is taking medicine for ADHD, and I can't even imagine how rotten I would feel if someone told me I was going to have to take a break for a few months, yikes!<br>  There is also an adjustment period when starting again, and feelings of withdrawal when stopping. I don't think anyone would want that sort of yo yo for their kid.|`|06PXqMYGaa	This is a question that should be addressed by a doctor, and the child's case history should be taken into consideration.|`|3b095b6efad8a3e2a0545db397727e70aa	If a child has ADD, they have ADD. Parents shouldn't just ignore it in the summer because kids don't have to 'behave' in school for a few months. It also tells children that taking medicines isn't a serious thing, which could lead them to be neglectful with important medicines they're prescribed as adults.<br>  <br>  Yes, it's common, from what I've heard, but I can't imagine it's healthy - your body gets used to medications taken over long periods of time, so kids would probably go through withdrawals when the medicines are stopped completely.|`|v5JbPcSWaa	Yes, it sure is!|`|wX2J8d5Daa	Or at any time when not needed for school, etc., if tolerable behaviour occurs.

RrQ7yKSjaa	Like the other person said, braces work faster the younger you are.  Nowadays, they are putting braces on seven year olds because the process will go a lot faster.  Your parents may be waiting because they are considering the possibility that your teeth will move, which is definitely possible.  People in my family were apprehensive to have me get braces because of this.<br>  I am a younger teen (in high school) and I got my braces on a few months ago.  So far they are working very well and I am pleased with the progress.  <br>  If you and your sister are uncomfortable with metal braces showing in high school like I was, then there are other options.  Invisalign is very expensive and with two girls needing braces, your parents probably won't consider it.  I have ceramic braces on top and metal on the bottom.  Ceramic braces are basically invisible and work just as well as metal braces.  They are also not too much more expensive.  Talk to your parents about these.  Here is some info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.archwired.com/ceramic_vs_metal_braces.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.archwired.com/ceramic_vs_meta...</a><br>  <br>  Show your parents this post with my answer and the other answer....they should help a little, I hope.  Good luck to you and your sister with braces :-)|`|5Bk5tMiJaa	The experts say the earlier you get the braces on the less time you will have to wear them. As permanent teeth come in and get stabilized they are more difficult to move.  If the jaw needs to be expanded at all that is done easier while young, actually in grade school might have been better if you guys are difficult cases. I'd get to the orthodontist ASAP and let him tell you. Good luck.

hCg6w5Wvaa	Anything that causes a buzz means brain cells are being destroyed.  That is what the buzz is.<br>  So no drug is good including the legal stuff.<br>  If we had been smoking weed for the last 200 years and tobacco just now came along--or booze--it would all be illegal because it causes such radical health problems.  Radical health problems cost the gov a lot in health care hence the laws.<br>  Pot is prob less damaging than tobacco which is horribly addictive.<br>  Personally pot doesn't show me anything.  It just made me stupid and I'd like to be smart.  Hope I helped u decide the best.|`|Zmx40Nnpaa	For starters, it's an immunosuppressant - it weakens your immune system, leaving you vulnerable to illness/disease beyond the obvious respiratory conditions that smoking any type of plant (including tobacco) cause.  Chronic bronchitis (ever talked to a smoker - pot or tobacco - that ALWAYS sounds sick?), inflammation of the lung, and of course lung cancer.  One joint has 4 times the tar of one cigarette - so it will get to the full blown cancer much quicker than regular ol' cigarettes.<br>  <br>  It has been directly linked to mental health problems, including permanent memory loss, panic attacks, delusions, depression, hallucinations, and so on.  In the short term, it impairs judgment, perception, thinking, memory, and learning. Chronic use of pot (more than six weeks) makes the short term affects irreversable (thus long term).<br>  <br>  It's not worth it.|`|WCyfCxs1aa	pot isnt as bad as a lot of other drugs that are legal. its only illegal because its a plant that can be grown anywhere and the government can't regulate it. therefore, if they cant regulate it they cant make money off of it. thats why its illegal. get it?
TvAXzIauaa	The way not to do it is starve yourself, to start with. Just exercise and eat right. I did....lost 90 LBS because of it. Starving yourself won't help at all. Drink more water, eat less before bed, and don't eat for stress are the 3 things I follow and i'm going pretty well if i don't say myself. 90 LBS isn't anything like 5-10lbs so take my advice. If you want anymore details, feel free to email me. ~Adia <br>  PS: i use to get home from school and eat b/c of stress and other things and ate before bed-i think that's why i stayed overweight for so long. try eating a big breakfast or healthy one at least and a nice lunch at school and a snack, then light dinner like a sandwich or something simple.|`|cutODsRcaa	you have to balance youre diet<br>  breakfast is necessary<br>  try to drink some tea with tea biscuits so you dont have gas<br>  something hot<br>  and probably something light for lunch<br>  dont starve youreslf to lose weight<br>  im losing weight now starving isnt the way|`|tLlK3aXBaa	if you eat breakfast it will get your digestive system going so you will lose weight. and i don't think the school food is good anyway.|`|ZiYhx17Waa	You need to eat breakfast - eating breakfast fuels your brain & your madabolism! You also need to eat lunch. If all you have time for is a bar that's fine, eat a healthy breakfast or protein bar - but you need to eat. you will actually gain weight doing this.<br>  <br>  To maintain a healthy lifestyle & get in shape try this:<br>  <br>  Try making small changes, if you really love a certain food that is ok, just cut down your portions, you don't need to deprive yourself to be healthy.<br>  <br>  As for your overall diet try to cut down on your calories, eat lean protein, and whole grains - bread is not bad, so long as it is whole grain & high in fiber, also eat your veggies & drink lots of water. Also lean calcium products such as yogurt, low fat milk & cheese fill up with low calories & high nutrition content. Cut out saturated & monosaturated fats & excess sugar<br>  For snacks I eat a lot of fruit & veggies as snacks, baby carrots, snap peas, grape tomatoes, grapes, berries, peaches. I also love the Flat Earth veggie & fruit chips, Quaker ranch rice cakes, popcorn, whole grain crackers, dark chocolate, blue diamond nut thins & string cheese. These are all small snacks with low fat & low calories.<br>  <br>  It is best to eat 1200-1500 calories per day, if you eat less than this your metabolism will slow down, making it harder to lose weight. NO fast food. don't drink empty calories, stick to water, low cal juices (I mix 100% juice w/25% water to lower calories) & low fat milk. no soft drinks (diet or regular) <br>  no eating unless you are hungry!<br>  <br>  That being said, never underestimate the power of a good workout routine. In order to be healthy you MUST make time to exercise. Not exercising is not an option if you want to be healthy.<br>  <br>  Lots of Cardio & weight training. do 30-45 minutes of strength training 3-4 times per week followed by 45-50 minutes of cardio 5-6 times per week. do your strength training 1st, it burns more calories. I also do loads of crunches prior to & after cardio. Also walk more during the day. Take a walk on your lunch break, walk to the store, aim for 10,000 steps per day a pedometer is a great idea. The more active you are the more calories you will burn & the more weight you will lose.<br>  <br>  To stay healthy & not get discouraged remember this:<br>  It is not recommended that you lose more than 2-3 pounds per week.

zC0XLym5aa	Do Crunches. Lie on the floor (with or without a mat). Cross your arms in front of your chest. (Donot place both hands behind your head. Placing both hands behind your head can cause lower back problems in the long run as it places unnecessary stress on that part of your body from pulling on your head and neck.) Another alternative to crossing your arms in front of your chest is to lightly place your finger tips behind your ears, without pulling on your neck or ears to help raise you off the floor. Draw in your abdomen towards your spine while inhaling through your nose. Now raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off of the floor. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor exhale through your mouth, ending with a gasp once your shoulders are off the floor. Then pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. The proper breathing and flexing make all the difference. Now lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground and repeat. <br>  <br>  Do Sit Ups. Lie on the floor, feet on the floor, knees up and hands behind your head or crossed on your chest. Sit all the way up, lifting your lower back off the floor along with your shoulder blades. Lower yourself down. Repeat. Once this becomes relatively easy for you (i.e. you can do a quite a bit with ease) start adding more challenges. Find an incline bench or do these on an exercise ball. Once you "graduate" from that, do weighted sit ups. Hold a weight on your chest while you do these. As these become easier, hold heavier and heavier weights. You might also try lifting your feet off the ground while doing the sit ups or alternating the leg in the air, like pretending to pedal while sitting up. If your hands are behind your head, bring your left knee up to touch your right elbow and then your right knee to the left elbow. <br>  Do Leg Lifts. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a ninety degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar. Still too easy?... <br>  Do Jackknife Sit Ups. Lie down flat on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. "spread out") and repeat. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it. What's that? More? <br>  Do V-ups. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands on the floor but this time extended out over your head. Simultaneously raise legs and torso. Don't bend your knees! What kind of V would it be if you bend your knees? Reach with your hands toward the raised feet. Touch your feet if possible (might require some flexibility). Relax, return to starting position and repeat. Add weight between feet to match your taste. <br>  Static Hold and Side Statics. Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and you whole body flat. This position is known as the static hold position and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place which is the real purpose of your abs. Hold this position for as long as possible, but you should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers known to achieve over 20 minute static holds. To perform the side static hold roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before, but this time only one arm will be on the ground with the other arm pointed straight up the air and your non-weight bearing leg resting on your bottom leg. Once again, hold this for as long as possible <br>  Train Your Oblique Muscles. It's not as important to work on your oblique muscles at first, but eventually you'll want to start working these too. These are the muscles to either side of your stomach. There are multiple ways to do this and anything that includes twisting your torso against a resistance counts. There are twisting machines at gyms, you can twist while you do sit-ups, you can do side bends, you can twist side to side with a medicine ball in hand, etc. Be aware though, that many beginners tend to have weak obliques compared to their abs (it simply isn't used as much in daily life) so go easy on the sides at first. <br>  Other stuff Since it is, literally, the center of your body there are many other tricks you can use to train your abs, and some of the other movements will more or less involve your abs. Including every abdominal exercise in existence would make this article painfully long and new methods are being developed constantly. Now that you've made up your mind about a washboard mid-section, get creative! Find new ways to crunch, bend and twist in your daily life. Some possibilities include: <br>  Use a stability ball. Do your crunches on the ball to introduce instability to your workout, which will improve your balance too. There are also lots of core exercises that can be done with a stability ball.You can also use a small bubble use for physical therapy. <br>  Duck and twist during your daily routine. Reach with your left hand to things on your right and vice versa. If you feel like turning around to face something, see if you can do it with keeping your hips in place and twisting at the waist (warning: awkward when talking to other people, use only against inanimate objects). While walking or standing, pretend that something is coming toward you and you have to duck to get out of the way. Do this as often as you are comfortable or at times when it won't look weird. You can bend forward from the hips or, if you're really into it, bend at the knees too and really "sink" out of the way. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Weights. The more muscle your body has, the more calories your body burns, even at rest. Many people are afraid of getting huge due to weight lifting. This is meaningless. You will NOT gain a lot of mass if you're not taking in a lot of calories as well. Also keep in mind that most of the huge people you see on TV or in print achieve that state by going on high protein and high carb diets. They increase their calorie intake specifically to bulk up. So the fear of bulking up should NOT be a reason to not lift weights. As a rule of thumb, the larger the muscle the more energy it will burn to sustain itself. Therefore the most effective muscle groups to work for fat loss are large muscle groups: thighs and hamstrings, the back, and the chest. You can also lift your body weight without going to a gym, through push ups, sit ups, chin ups, etc. <br>  <br>  Do Cardio. No matter how muscular your abs are that six pack isn't going to show if you cover it up with a layer of fat. Running, biking, swimming, stair climbing, jumping rope, tennis, volleyball, dancing, squash or any other activity that gets you moving and keeps you moving is a great way to burn fat. However, a cardio workout should be performed for at least 20 MINUTES to burn fat. Prior to this your body will simply run on its stored energy, which results in minimal fat loss. Cardio should always be done after your weight lifting workout. While lifting weights, you use stored, (carb) energy, thus, by doing cardio after weight training your body will have less stored energy to use and go straight into the fat storage for its energy use. The overall best way to shed fat fast is to do cardio(30 min minimum) right when you wake up. Your body will search for energy to use, when it finds nothing in your stomach, it will go directly to your fat storage for energy and the fat will burn up so fast! <br>  Diet Tips<br>  <br>  Keep Metabolism Steady. Eating one small meal (such as a potato, a salad, etc.) every three hours that you are awake will not speed up your metabolism, rather, it will keep it going. Your metabolism goes and slows with your food intake and eating something small every three hours will keep that metabolism burning calories and will help you lose weight. <br>  Eat Smaller Dinners. Cut down on the size of your dinner. If you're hungry, snack on fruits or other healthy, low calorie snacks. Large dinners tend to hurt a fat loss process because most people aren't very active after dinner. This is the basis for advice along the lines of "don't eat anything within X hours before going to bed". The claim that your entire dinner is stored as fat isn't entirely true (the process is more complicated than that) but the fact you don't move after dinner is enough to hurt your cause. You can offset this by eating a larger lunch or snacking healthily before dinner. Fresh fruits or vegetables are excellent choices for curbing appetite not to mention other health benefits. A handful of nuts might do the same. Drink a large glass of water before sitting at the table. <br>  Eat More Fiber. Most people don't get enough fiber. The recommended amount is actually not that much if you eat a healthy diet. "Fiber foods" include whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds. Other options are fiber supplements. <br>  Eat Breakfast. Many people skip breakfast because they don't have time for it. Keep this in mind: You don't have time to skip breakfast, it's simply too valuable to skip. The fact that skipping breakfast messes up your concentration and other mental functions is beyond the scope of this article. The harm of skipping breakfast from a weight loss perspective is it makes you eat a huge lunch since your body hasn't had anything in the past 12 (or more) hours. When you eat a huge lunch you get that after meal drowsiness so now you're both unproductive and inactive. Cereals don't take much time to prepare and consume, and most of them are very healthy nowadays. If you are extremely pressed for time, consider grabbing a box of breakfast bars or a smoothie and throwing one in your bag when you leave for work or school. Some breakfast bars out there are also excellent sources of fiber. <br>  Eat Smaller Meals More Frequently. This helps raise your metabolism too. It's not easy to do though since it's a relatively big change to most people's routines. But it doesn't have to be a full blown meal, simply eat often but less. A jar of nuts in the office will do just fine, grab a handful when you feel like it. Most fruits can last for a couple days without refrigeration, and if you have a refrigerator at the office, make use of it. <br>  <br>  Drink More Water Everyday. Many places suggest 8 cups (2 L) of water a day. It sounds like an absurd amount of water, but actually, you can drink tea without sugar to make up some of the quota. In fact tea, especially green tea, rev up your "metabolism" (actually cause a temporary increase in calories burned).<br>  For fat loss purposes, it is important to remind yourself that thirst is a much weaker stimuli than hunger. If you consistantly feel hungry after meals, don't immediately think that you need to eat more. You may simply be thirsty!<br>  Needless to say there are many benefits of water. 69% of your body is made of it! <br>  We can exist without food for months, but without water we can only survive for a few days. Your body is made up mostly of water, which: <br>  <br>  Is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption and elimination <br>  Aids circulation <br>  Helps control the body's temperature <br>  Lubricates and cushions joints <br>  Keeps the skin healthy <br>  Helps remove toxins from your body <br>  Every day you lose water from the body through urine and sweat, and this fluid needs to be replenished. However, your body has come equipped with a mechanism that tells you when you need to replenish your supply--it’s called thirst!<br>  <br>  Drinking water is good for you. It will not make you fat, if you drink 8 glasses a day or even 15. Just dont drink too much more than that. <br>  <br>  <br>  ohh and for jumping higher. Attack weights to your feet and jump up the stairs. I think there are special weights you can find for that but I am not entirely sure. This does work though.

If you are overweight, Men tend to store all their excess weight in their Stomaches. If you recently LOST weight the Belly Fat you are seeing might in fact be extra skin.

To help with this dilemna, always arch your back opposite the way you are feeling weight pulling it. Tighten your stomach muscles to compensate when doing this to support your back arch. For example, when doing bicep curls, eyes straight ahead, shoulders back (not squeezing them together) and back arched, hips sticking out to where you can feel the stretch in your lower back, and stomach muscles taking much of the tension this position causes. Think of it like your sticking your belly out then tighten it during the rep. <br>  <br>  If you want to tighten up try this for 4-6 weeks with this diet. Eliminate all drink and food that contain sugar. Eliminate all carbohydrates except fruit. Eat vegetables, fruit, and protiens. Don't worry about proportions with the diet. Eat the amount of veggies, fruit, and meat that make you feel sufficiently well. You don't want to be weakm soar, and hungry. It will take about 2-3 weeks of feeling weak and sick before you get adjusted. You may lose your power initially, but you will gain momentum  and adjust. <br>  <br>  Moderation with carbs after you accomplish your look you want, and excellent form when lifting can get you where you want. I don't believe you need cardio to get ripped. I know people who never do cardio and they are ripped. I ride bycyle 25 miles a day (and have a disease much like lupus) when the weather is warm, and eat like I described above and my gut has tightened up. But some people are just ripped. Take care, and keep it up.
8N3IYhSVaa	Shoulder press, military press, push ups, bench press, triceps extensions, skull crushers, pull downs, pull ups, chin ups, ab work, bicep curl, concentration curl, lateral press, etc...|`|NIPy0SUuaa	you can workout more than once a week, just dont get on any supplements yet.  but hitting the gym 4-5 days a week is fine|`|8jPX3XNSaa	idk.... sum push ups, pull ups,mayb weight lifting,... once again.. idk wat 2 say|`|d5Jr4K8Baa	maybe some push ups<br>  <br>  thats all I can think of sorry
kQr1RGUIaa	Not too much trouble?  Well, that is something you will discover in life that if you have that attitude, you will not achieve what you really want.  Now, if you are serious about playing your game and not getting hurt, pushed around, and looking like a little boy then apply yourself as a man should. On to the physical workout recommendations:<br>  Self resistance exercises are the key for you.  push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, handstand push-ups or just handstands in general, hindu push-ups and hindu squats (yahoo search.  There are descriptions of how to do these, you just have to look a bit) <br>  Check out Matt Furey's website, www.mattfurey.com.  <br>  He has a whole system of strength builders and he doesn't use free weights.  I have been doing self resistance exercises for years, and long before finding Matt's site.  I know they work and are the best for strength, endurance, and flexibility.

ItagB1p2aa	No, you're not overweight. Skipping meals makes you gain weight, not lose it.|`|1aFSnPGVaa	you're underweight.  Dont skip meals and focus on gaining 5-8 pounds.|`|AAnWfPogaa	Skipping dinner will actually slow your metabolism down, so if you were wanting to lose weight, you wouldn't do so as easily.  My suggestion is to eat healthy foods (skip the junk food--It will only make you die younger!)  Also, stay active  (simple walking or playing sports is usually good), don't worry about what other people think of you.  You are unique and your own self!<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|ZqbHDIyWaa	No and No|`|f41149ed38ea824da7051530ad8c72fbaa	You are not overweight at all. In fact, you need to put on some weight, preferably in the form of muscle, which will stand you in good stead throughout your life. <br>  <br>  Go to your local YMCA or the school gym and ask for help getting started safely with weights. Make sure you eat healthy, don't skip breakfast or any meal but eat small portions 5-6 times a day. Stretch after every workout. A typical workout schedule for you could be cardio three times a week, weights twice a week with at least one day's rest in between, and sports. If you do all this starting now, you will develop impressive, lean muscle tone and develop confidence in yourself and also project attractiveness. <br>  <br>  I started working out regularly right around your age (I am 40 now) and am in great shape as a result. Good luck!|`|oO4WIdKkaa	You aren't overweight. Your BMI is 18.1 whichi is actually underweight.|`|MteBirNBaa	Where did you get the idea that you are over weight?  who ever is feeding you that info is seriously mistaken. Don't worry about being over weight. Just eat right and exercise and your body will take care of it's self.|`|f4YB0TLLaa	no way! you to gain some pounds!|`|hiHNVLDaaa	no u r not overweight.<br>  <br>  i have heard that if u skip meals u r morely likely to put on weight|`|lByXZ0LBaa	It all depends on your muscle mass.  But no, it doesn't sound like it.  At your age your body needs healthy foods for development.  Protein is an excellent source for building muscle.  You're at that age :)  good luck.
WXExyAlWaa	I'm pretty sure this is a symptom of your stress. You're feeling under a lot of pressure and reacting against it by wanting to lash out and break free.     If you have a gaming system, playing something like Tekken Tag really hardcore could help, or if that's not possible, you could freeze a tray of water to make sheets of ice to smash. Or get some air-drying clay to make things to smash. Even specially buying a cheap plate set! Try to get some of this out instead of holding it all in.|`|0qGsS5hJaa	welcome to puberty|`|FVWvN07xaa	you sound just like meee.  Cept im 18.   It really is just puberty and being all hormonal.     well,  atleast i hope it is.|`|q1cqgVVSaa	have a gratitude journal you should put down things like, you have parents be thankful for what you have. don't sulk all the time because things aren't going your way. some people are going through worse situations than you.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	I get the same way sometimes. And what I've noticed is that it's the worst around when I'm going to get my period, usually a week before. What I would do is start tracking it to see if it is, because you might have PMDD which is just like PMS to the extreme. What I started doing when it got really bad was run. Seriously, I'd just grab my MP3 player and go for a run, or walk. It gives you a lot of time to think and sort out your problems. Also, whenever you feel you have too many things to keep track of, or you get those millions of thoughts running through your head at night when you are trying to sleep, just write it down in a planner or diary. Hope that helps. And don't worry, It's only temporary.|`|y43tzOQlaa	Yes you are just that, a 16 year old, and all that comes with it. The pressure, the exams, the stupid friends, the stupid teachers, the parents who don't know a thing. It is all pretty normal stuff, you need to be able to step back and focus on one thing at a time. Do you have a hobby? Sports, clubs, something that will get your mind off of the stresses. It is also important to talk to a school counselor or someone you really can trust. When you want to smash something for no reason do it. I've been known to throw a bottle or two but I now do it in a recycle can cause I was tired of cleaning up the glass. Just take it one day at a time, your really a normal 16 yr. old who needs to be able to reach out. Take Care....|`|CYzTJIhVaa	Sounds like you are growing up!  You also sound very overwhelmed.  My advice to you-DO THE BEST YOU CAN!!!!  that is all you can do.  Don't give up and do give it your all.  Don't think about comparing yourself to anyone, just do the best YOU can do.  After all is said and done, you will look back and know that you did your best.  But baby girl, just calm down and breath, you got this.  It is ok to feel frustrated and overwhelmed, it happens to the best of us.  Just try not to dwell on it.  the more time you spend focusing on this, the less time you have to catch up on your work!  Think of it that way.  Trust me, you can do it.  We have all been there before, especially in school and work.  Another thing, stop worrying about your friends and how much you think you hate them.  I know it is easier said than done but it is definitely worth it for the peace of mind.  I hope this was helpful!!!|`|Gxog88I3aa	You said that you suffer from depression, with depression added stress just makes things worse.  You might want to talk to your doctor about changing your medication.

Hang in there.|`|klTI9nBEaa	iam a guy 16 but iam worse i feel unreal 24/7 for year and half talking aboout depression lol???  u have to forget about it.

c68nVKIYaa	In conventional massage, yes, you have to remove your shirt -- you get down to your birthday suit and cover your privates with a towel. Yes, the therapist uses a massage oil. I don't know how you would massage very effectively without it (I took a massage class also).    I had quite a few massages some years ago when my scoliosis was causing me a lot of pain. It helped short-term, for a few days. It can't help longer because of the nature of scoliosis.     The problem is that in scoliosis spinal muscles are imbalanced. Every scoliosis consists of a complex pattern of imbalances, muscle groups on one side of the back growing stronger than others. The stronger ones will tighten up and some develop knots because they're doing most of the work. Massage can temporarily relieve the tension, but obviously not for long.    For long-term relief you need to strengthen the weak muscles and even out the imbalances as far as possible. The Schroth method aims to do exactly that. Search yahoo on Schroth method for more information and for therapists, or check out the sources below. Christa Lehnert-Schroth treated scoliosis patients for 50 years and wrote a textbook that give a thorough overview and shows a lot of exercises.     Good luck with your pain relief!|`|8WYWEDOpaa	Message may or may not help with pain.  It depends on where the pain is coming from.  (I got back rubs from my wife and she never got to the place that hurt.)  I've never been to a professional, though.    I think its a good thing to try.  Just don't expect your curve to be reduced.|`|o0JD0hitaa	I don't have scoliosis, but I am a massage therapist and have worked with scoliosis.    You're going to want to talk to your massage therapist. You will probably get better work addressing the scoliosis if you are willing to remove your shirt. You should remain safely covered throughout the massage. This does depend somewhat on techniques being used - Craniosacral Therapy works very well through clothing for example, by Myofascial Release isn't always as effective through clothing.    The use of oil/lotion/body butter also depends on the techniques being used.    If you want to keep your clothes on, that is an option. I am usually quite good at working through most clothing.    A typical session is an hour. I usually plan for a 90 minute block (fill out forms, get changed, do the massage, clean up after). You should be able to get changed and on the table between the sheets in privacy.    The people that I have worked with who had scoliosis found that it helped the pain. You may get different results based on your needs and the training of your therapist.    Good luck

ug7xWZoXaa	I am in the same boat.  Winter is so bad for your skin because its so much dryer and colder outside.    First of all, water isnt going to help unless you start drinking it lol.  What I did was started using an oil-free face wash, a vitamin C serum, and an oil free moisturizer.  Specifically, I got it at Sally's.  The face wash is the Gigi organics one, the Vita-C serum, and the moisturizer is the clinique moisture surge.    The key to healthy, clear skin is drinking water and using a good moisturizer.  Make sure its oil-free to help with your acne, and use it twice a day to help keep your skin beautiful.|`|fFD3cYGJaa	Cure zits overnight by dabbing toothpaste on them just before bedtime. Toothpaste dries the oil and gets rid of the zit.    To get rid of redness and calm skin, first, take two Advil  theyre anti-inflammatory. Then, apply Visine drops to remove redness quick.    Dab egg white onto pimples to draw impurities from the skin.    For softer skin, put a pot of water on the stove. Add a few drops of lavender or peppermint oil and bring to a rolling boil. Drape a towel over your head, and hold your face over the steam. The steam will draw out impurities, and the oils will have a calming effect.    Cook plain, old-fashioned oatmeal and cool it in the refrigerator. Rub it on your face for softer skin.    For those stubborn blackheads, mix cornstarch with vinegar and rub it on the area. Allow it to harden for 15-30 minutes, then wash off with warm water and a washcloth. This will draw out bacteria and clear pores.    To get rid of acne, spread a thin layer of Milk of Magnesia on your face. Let it dry, and wipe off with warm washcloth  it works as well or better than expensive facial masks!    So now you can heal acne fast, with products you already have around the house. In a pinch, these home remedies are a lifesaver!|`|iB22RWkGaa	Put oil free lotion on your face after you shower.

And you are eating inside 2000 I presume.  2000 calories of french fries - 2000 calories of fruit same thing - but they are different in size and amount/weight    Also don't think just because you are staying slim and not gaining weight you are under the idea of 'good health' and that you are healthy and safe - you are not.  You do not know the damage that bad food will cause to your heart and arteries causing many a problem.

8s2JXMWcaa	1) Two liter of water are usually no problem, at least no deminerilisation will occur.     2) Consider the amount you drink altogether per day, i.e. including all other beverages. Without much sports this usually does not exceed two liters, with lots of sports and a lot of sweating it might easily be necessary to drink 3 liters per day -- all depending on heat and sweat.     3) If you are worried, drink water mixed with a little bit of pure juice. This will avoid any danger of having to less minerals. Alternatively, replace some water with isotonic sports drinks, e.g. 1,5 l water and 0,5 l isotonic drink.    4) Please be aware of strong thirst without any good reason is an indicator for diabetes.

WXExyAlWaa	Oh boy. Well... when you start feeling angry, you could try to calm yourself down a little. I know easier said than done, controlling irrational behaviour can be _hard_, but it is possible. Carry something small in your pocket that you can hold onto and focus on, and try to slow your breathing - if you are concentrating on that it's easier to ignore the anger.     You could also talk to your family doctor about how you're feeling and see if s/he thinks talk therapy or even a low dose medication is a useful idea. They might not, but they may have some other suggestions that could help you.|`|Gxog88I3aa	You need to seek counseling or anger management.  For some reason you have been an angry young lady for way too long.

I think being homeschooled would be great.  I spend my high school years with kids that it seemed like the only reason they went to school was to annoy the underdogs of the world.  Just because I am not beautiful, a jock, a brain, a cheerleader, I didn't have and expensive wardrobe, new shoes...Just because I wasn't like everyone else in the school, doesn't mean that it is ok to throw paper, spitballs in your hair...etc.  They don't know what goes on at home in other kids houses.  Do they think it will make me a better person making fun or throwing thinkg laughing at my dress.  People are basically cruel and it won't get any better when your older, they just grow up to be older jerks.    Seek medical help for the mood swings that might help out, it did me.  Take relaxation class.  Don't sweat the small stuff.  Good luck in school just do your best, you education is more importand then the other kids being stupid.
asZmhAjcaa	I just got my braces so I can tell you the entire process. The process of bracing, for me, was broken up into several appointments.<br>  <br>  1. Consultation<br>  I consulted an orthodontist and asked questions about bracing. She examined my teeth. X-rays were taken and she explained about how I need to remove my impacted wisdom teeth and 4 pre-molars for braces.<br>  <br>  She also talked to me about payment. I had my molds made after everything. I was then sent to an oral surgeon to have a day set for extraction.<br>  <br>  You might or might not need to have teeth extracted. Only your orthodontist can tell you this. Also, do not be afraid to have a second opinion.<br>  <br>  2. Extraction<br>  I had eight teeth removed under general anesthesia. Everything went fine.<br>  <br>  3. Separators<br>  7 days after extraction I went back to have separators placed. They are small blue rubber bands that are placed between your molars to make space for the molar bands. They simply floss the separators in. Expect sharp pain that quickly goes away each time your orthodontist floss one in.<br>  <br>  Separators cause a certain degree of discomfort, but it is not pain. It feels like as if food is trapped at the back. It is very important not to mess with them because if they fall out before the next appointment you will need to go back to have them replaced.<br>  <br>  4. Molar Bands<br>  Molar bands are simply metal rings that are put on, well, the molars. The process is painless. It is like buying a ring. They try different sizes of the metal rings and see which size fits your teeth. When they do find the perfect size, dental glue is applied and the molar bands are placed.<br>  <br>  Wax should be given because the molar bands are rather sharp at the sides and can cause ulcers. Other than the sharpness, the molar bands are painless to have.<br>  <br>  5. Bonding<br>  This is the last step for initial braces placement. Brackets are bonded to your teeth and wires placed.<br>  <br>  They do several brackets at one time and expose them to UV light (a small hand-held lamp that emits blue light) so that bonding takes place. Apparently, the glue (or something) does it work only when exposed to UV light. This process is repeated until all the required brackets are in place.<br>  <br>  I was asked to choose a color after the brackets were placed. Your orthodontist might ask this earlier though. Wires are then placed. The entire process was around 40 minutes for me and was relatively painless.<br>  <br>  6. Post Initial Braces Placement<br>  Well, it did not hurt for me until several hours later. When I leave the teeth alone they do not hurt - just a tingling sensation. Biting down hurts though, and I rate the pain a 6.5. Brushing for the first few days is a pain because it hurts to touch the teeth.<br>  <br>  The pain, however, goes away after a few days (thank goodness). Expect the pain to come back every time you have the braces tightened though.<br>  <br>  It might be wise to note that some people have their braces placed in one single appointment. Mine was separated so I am simply reciting my experience.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :D|`|LCAzlHhEaa	I had my braces removed this past Feb., after I had all my wisdom teeth pulled.  However, to get my teeth straight after pulling the wisdom teeth I also had to have 2 more teeth pulled on my top.  <br>  <br>  When they put the braces on the putting braces on is pretty painless; however when they put the wire and the bands on it gets painful I rank it a 10.  It hurt so bad after a few hours I had to take the rubber bands off for a day to get used to the pain.  My advice is always take tylenol or some other pain killer a few hours before going to get the braces but on.  <br>  <br>  After you get used to the braces it is painless until you have to go back and get them tightened.  Again you will get a new wire and new rubber bands & again it is painful at least a 10.<br>  <br>  Removing the braces is AWFUL!!! I think it hurt more than getting my teeth pulled.  They will pop the braces off your teeth & then scrap the cement off; and then polish and clean your teeth.  The popping and scrapping is off the charts painful!  Remember to wear your retainer as instructed by your dentist!  <br>  <br>  BTW I was 24 when I got braces so I got clear (white) braces not the normal metal braces worn by children & my bands were clear as well.  The wire was still a wire but it was alot less noticable than the regular metal braces.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and just remember to take some sort of pain medicine a few hours before going to the dentist before having them tightened & the next day after tightening I could only eat milk shakes because my mouth just plain hurt!|`|0E8SPyyXaa	dont worry i got my braces on 7 months ago and have a year left when you get them on they might hurt depends on your teeth if you have buck teeth like me it hurts like a 8 or a 9 if you just have gaps it wont hurt as much just eat lots of ice cream or yogurt whatever  suites you but its deffinatly worth it i had buck teeth now i get more attention from girls i have alot of confindence in myself also and braces helped me alot and i hope they help you goodluck and dont complain about them|`|AA10283901	It is not that bad.  Everyone's pain tolerance is different, but I felt about a three.  It can be uncomfortable but not completely painful.  This only occurs when they first get put on and when you have your appointment when they tighten them about once a month.  That last no more than a couple of days.  I had no problems with braces.  The initial spacers are worse han anything and even they are no higher than a five with pain.<br>  <br>  I am actually getting ready to get braces again because I have had some set backs with my teeth.  Don't worry - this is very rare and you will not have to get them twice!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK Hon!|`|OY4um4PVaa	My braces barely hurt. When they tighten it, it gets a little painful, and I have springs, which always go .. weird when I eat something hard, like an apple slice. I did get a gum infection ( I think. From what people said on here it sounds like it) from them, though that just might be me. So I would rate them at 5.<br>  <br>  It's fun to change the colors, but be careful which ones you pick.

3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	I had one cut out of my big toe a long time ago. From what I remember, they put a topical anesthetic on it first, then injected a local anesthetic. They asked if I wanted N2O gas. I said yes, which I later regretted because it made me woozy and sick.<br>  <br>  The doc quickly cut out the wart and bandaged it up. I think it only took a minute or two. No pain. All I felt was pressure. And it didn't really hurt much afterward. The hardest thing was keeping it dry and clean until it started filling in with scar tissue.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, I think he also burned out the roots or cauterized it with a laser or some other tool because I can remember the flesh burning smell. Sorry if that's a bit graphic. I'd ask your doc about the procedure. Maybe things are easier now. I had it done almost 10 years ago.|`|qybtMl3Jaa	The doctor will numb just your foot and then remove the whole wart and possibly others. It will be a little uncomfortable, but only for a short time.|`|6Fhl3LXZaa	If you believe in natural medicine at all, listen to this. My son had his plantar wart on his foot burned or frozen several times to no avail.  Someone in the natural food store recommended giving him the homeopathic pills, Thuja daily - letting them dissolve under his tongue 15 minutes before eating, about three times a day at 30cc strength.  It was gone before you know it and he has never had another wart of any kind, whereas he had warts on his hands sometimes. He also had  a tendency towards fever blisters, and he has never had another one of those either.  Just a suggestion.  I have had several homeopaths tell me thuja is good for warts since that time.|`|IvoaNyN2aa	One of the best things is castor oil  You can put some on a bandage and tape it to your foot and be sure to use it when you sleep<br>  <br>  Here is a page with some othoer ideas<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myhomeremedies.com/topic.cgi?topicid=282" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhomeremedies.com/topic.cgi?...</a>|`|iT5oULdSaa	somthing with a name somthing like "wartner" its at jean coutu and pharmaprix

Here is a list of risk factors:    Tobacco use.   Heavy alcohol use.   Barrett esophagus: A condition in which the cells lining the lower part of the esophagus have changed or been replaced with abnormal cells that could lead to cancer of the esophagus. Gastric reflux (the backing up of stomach contents into the lower section of the esophagus) may irritate the esophagus and, over time, cause Barrett esophagus.   Older age.   Being male.   Being African-American.|`|5657dabb07790f85827e1c0e8e02e5c0aa	Coincidentally I have had 2 close friends who died of esophageal cancer -- within 1 year of each other.  Both were Caucasian males ... neither one was a smoker ... one was 35 years old and the other was 50 years old.  Ironically neither of them met the general criteria for being a victim of esophageal cancer.  So there are no real "rules" -- just "criteria".  That's the scary thing about cancer -- it doesn't always follow the rules.

BG8vMyZjaa	I have moved around a lot and my doctor tells me some of my notes are missing.  Which ones I do not know, he said 'they must be somewhere'!  +++++  From Dr G Easton's article, it is preceded by his memory of the old system.  Computerised medical records give me a reliable and accurate summary of your medical history at the click of a button.  I can also check whether you have any major chronic diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or diabetes, and whether you're due for any checks such as cervical smears or blood pressure measurement.  In fact, the computer will give me a rude reminder if anything is outstanding: 'This woman has not had a cervical smear in the last five years.'  I'll usually check your last few consultations, too. The notes will be succinct, legible (except for a few typos) and have a clear electronic signature so I know which doctor you saw last time, and what thoughts he or she had about your problem.  If we want to look back at what a specialist recommended in 2001, I can quickly search through all the documents that have been scanned into your notes. It takes a few seconds and no paper-folding skills.  I can also see instantly the medications you're getting from the surgery on a regular basis, and which you've had in the past.  Computers help to make prescribing medicines safer for you.    First, the pharmacist is less likely to have trouble reading my spidery writing and so mistakes over dosages and names of medicines should be less likely.    Second, when I prescribe a medicine for you the computer will remind me of the drug's side-effects and whether it might have any important interactions with any treatments you're already taking. It will also tell me if you have any allergies or have had adverse reactions to drugs previously.  Third, the computer is much better at keeping tabs on repeat prescriptions. It's harder nowadays for patients to be on regular medications for years and years without having the appropriate checks and monitoring.|`|GO7tZtPxaa	I work for the Medical Record department for the NHS and yes, when you move/change doctors your medical records will folow you to your new doctor.. This is then summarised onto their screens.    This is to ensure continuity of care...    Hope this helps!|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	In the USA, medical records are PRIVATE and you must release them fro a doctor to share them with another doctor or practitioner. In the UK, it may be differerent . . . it is with countries utilizing socialized medicine.

tXmu16Niaa	I use Crest White Strips about once a year.  They really do work.  I have actually experienced the same pain as you were describing.  I asked my dentist about it and he said it is not serious, if you have sensitive teeth you can feel a type of pain.  It will not hurt you.  The bottom strip slides for me, too.  It doesn't matter, though, once the gel gets on your teeth, you are good to go...it will make you salivate more, but don't worry you can't overdose on the strips.  Just to let you know, using them once isn't going to help brighten your smile, you need to get the whole box.  The free sample would be pointless for me to try out, when it doesn't change your teeth color.  Although, you will most likely feel the same type of pain that I did, I would suggest using Sensodyne toothpaste to help with the sensitivity of your teeth.  Like I said before, they really do brighten your smile, but only if you use them two a day for the allotted time.  Hope this helps.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	Yes supposed to be gooey under - that is the bleach. And your teeth are reacting to the bleach - that is very common. Bleaching your teeth can irritate your gums and cause extreme pain in some people's teeth. If you can't handle the pain then I would discontinue use.|`|xshrKvIRaa	Crest whitestrips are just a gooey mess. I stopped using them years ago. They don't stick well, then taste terrible, and they made my teeth sensitive. That is probaly what your shooting pain is from. Just throw them out and you'll be back to normal soon.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Tooth sensitivity does happen with some people.  You'll be fine.|`|5Q9TokFKaa	i swear by them! i normally dry my teeth but it doesnt do anything different really. the bottom slides more becaue your lip is on it the top lip doesnt really sit on your teeth. i get drooly too aha its cause you cant really swallow that much. like at the dentist. you seem to drool more. yes it gets veryyyyy gelly! i actually have to keep wiping my lip becuase its so gelly aha. i get the shooting pain too! its sensetivity and sometimes my gum turns white for a little bit because i like burnt it from the strip. its the best white strip for your teeth in my opinion so its alright. dont use it more than at night and in the morning or else tjhey will become horribly sensative. i normally do it for two days then only do it when i really need it again. good luck!|`|m5uzV6uqaa	A lot of people complain about this problem while using Crest white strips. Crest strips do work pretty well, but they are only temporary. The best way to get your teeth whitened is to see a dentist and discuss your options then because they can advise you. You can also ask your dentist on which foods you should avoid, in order for your teeth to get whiter.    I think the answer to your question is yes, this is completely normal, your teeth are likely just sensitive. If you keep on using these strips regularly though, your teeth will get even more sensitive, since whitening products damage the enamel (coating) on the teeth. Some people have their teeth removed if they get too sensitive. You could also try toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth to help with sensitive teeth though. Hope this helps.|`|KmOuWTDkaa	you may have really sensitive teeth, just didn't know it. I wouldnt try them again. the gel is a peroxide gel and I never swallow it, just spit it out.|`|d8KnXFoLaa	it is normal to drool alot. but sharp pains are not normal.  I have the white strips too. They are working normal for me.

Some things i've done that has definately helped are sit ups with some twists (sit up and turn left/right). Lots of those. and also lay on your back and use those muscles like you're making your lower back touch the ground (use muscles to pull in your belly button and hold). Do that without stopping and lift your knees so your legs are at a 90 degree angle, while still pulling in your stomach. Also what may help is to tighten your abb muscles while you walk, drive in car, etc.<br>  There's nothing wrong with trying to lose fat, as long as you don't try to lose weight, make sense?

First off having an abortion will put your body through a lot. Second there are a lot of people that would love to have your baby you can always choose adoption. It is not the baby's fault that this happened in your life. Yet you want to take that baby's life to make your own better. I have been trying to have a baby for over 9 years I got pregnant once and I lost that baby at 10 1/2 weeks. I had actual labor even though I was not far along. Please consider your options. This baby is not at fault. And yes it is a baby at conception.|`|B9yfHeRYaa	I really don't know much about abortion except that others have said it's a hard choice to make.    You have to decide if you want it or not. I am totally for abortion, IF you have a good reason. It sounds to me like you do have a very good reason. If you want the baby, you can keep it. If you don't, you can do the abortion thing, but that's only if you can go through with it. If you get there and chicken out, or even if you chicken out beforehand, then it's okay. You can go through with the pregnancy and give it up for adoption. The only down side that I can think of to that is that the world is becoming overrun with humans. Then again, there's many people who want children and just can't do it...physically can not do it...    As I said before, it's your choice. Don't listen to the people who are being rude to you...I read your post you made after this...that's what made me wanna read this one. So just go with your gut...btw being a parent will change your life...you're a little bit too young to be a parent in my opinion.|`|0KQUwBCQaa	i'm sorry i really dont know know about the legal stuff..do you have a planned parenthood near you. you can go online to theri website and find one near by and either call them up or go it and ask you questions. sorry if i wasnt much help|`|cZbejm9eaa	you can go to the doctors on your own once your 16 (in the UK) so you should be able to take your boyfriend with you.

You are right on target. your muscles ARE repairing on your days off, so you do need to feed them the protein they need.<br>     With what you are listing as your workouts, I'd recommend consuming enough grams of protein to equal your bodyweight x 1.5.<br>     And it doesn't have to be whey....remember real food. Chicken, fish, beef, eggs, etc.<br>     Keep up the great work!|`|5Dnd8BVOaa	It depends what you want.  If you want to build muscle, you need a gram of protein per pound of body weight every day.  So if you way 150 pounds, you need 150 grams of protein.
1aSrTpbhaa	I had two done at the same time and I didn't really know what it would be like but they give you a shot in your mouth which is really the worst part but just try not to look at the needle, it doesn't really hurt.  It justs an awkard sensation in your mouth and then the rest of the time you are just waiting for them to get done.  It is a really digusting noise that the tools make though, like a loud drilling sound in your ears.  I have a low pain tolerance and I would consider this an extremely minor event in my lifetime of pain occurances.|`|uz3WIqV3aa	not that much, they numb it and drill it away.|`|xoqWnqCHaa	sounds like your not to old if u never had a filing before, honestly it doesn't hurt it is mostly phsycological though, if u can take a shot than you'll be fine, its like a pinch|`|CL6aPgljaa	yes it hurts very much :( they inject your gum, which numbs it. then they clean the hole and then they drill it and then they fill it :D but hey, no pain no gain. good luck x|`|QbcnDDxUaa	Many people feel some sensitivity after they receive a filling. The tooth may be sensitive to pressure, air, sweet foods, heat or cold. Composite fillings often cause sensitivity, but other types of filling materials can, too.  In most cases, the sensitivity will subside over one to two weeks. Until then, try to avoid anything that causes it. If your tooth is extremely sensitive or your sensitivity does not decrease after two weeks, contact your dentist's office.    It's important to let your dentist know about any sensitivity you are feeling. The next time you need a filling, he or she may be able to use a different material and make changes to reduce sensitivity. People vary in their response to different materials. Your dentist has no way of predicting if your tooth will react to a particular material.    When you talk to your dentist about the sensitivity, try to describe it as precisely as possible. This information will help decide what should be done next. Your dentist may take out the filling and put in a new one. He or she may add a base, liner or desensitizing agent on the tooth as well. If the filling was very deep, you could need a root canal treatment to solve the problem.    Besides sensitivity, some people feel discomfort when they bite down. There are two types of pain, each with a different cause.    The first type occurs when you bite, and worsens over time. This is caused by a filling that interferes with your bite. Once your anesthetic wears off, you would notice this right away. Contact your dentist. You will need to return to the office to have the filling reshaped.      The second type of discomfort is a very sharp shock that appears only when your teeth touch. This is called galvanic shock. It is caused by two metals (one in the newly filled tooth and one in the tooth it's touching) producing an electric current in your mouth. This would happen, for example, if you had a new amalgam filling in a bottom tooth and had a gold crown in the tooth above it.  Your dentist polishes the filling after it is placed, but occasionally sharp edges may remain. If you find one, contact your dentist and arrange to have it smoothed as soon as possible to avoid injury to your tongue or mouth.|`|5VVzRA3paa	yes, fillings hurt they have to give you shots in your mouth and when that happens it makes life suck. trust me i've had them happen to me before. just stay calm and rock on!

3urpilpBaa	Every women is different and this may be your fluctuating hormones.  I did the same thing when I was that age but I still went to the Gyno.  Yes it is unpleasant but it eases your mind and starts a chart on your reproductive health.  I would make an appointment today!|`|latqVetPaa	There is places you can go, such as a planned parenthood facility. If the reason why you don't want to go to doctor is your parents, than that's the best choice..... I'm not a doctor, and can't diagnose you, but I have had prior experience in the medical field, and would advise you to see a doctor very soon.  If not take a few personal steps to outweigh what it may be. Avoid sex... If you have been sexually active, get a pregnancy test done. Planned parenthood offers than for maybe 10 dollars. Read and research all medications you may be taking. Certain birth control methods cause abnormal periods. The reason 2 why I say see a doctor, is if you are and think your pregnant that it posiibly can be an etopic pregnancy. If you feel this s the case and want to keep it, than get rest. People who speacilize in these things are OBGYN's. Certain stds and female reproductive problems, such as cysts, tumors, etc, who knows, alot of things, can cause the problem you are dealing with. Do you feel constipated or the urge to go? Any pain? It might just be you as well, everyones body acts differently, and you are young, it could be fine or it could be bad..... Good Luck.

Those only get covered for those chronically ill, old, or at risk (like you work in a hospital or day care center)  So you should just pay your $20 and thats it.  Usually co-pays are paid when you go to the doctors office, not later, however.

I know, used to work with them.|`|UXBetwb7aa	She is quite young to have problems, but the proceedure is a safe one.  The body is full of mysteries and the doctors are trying to figure out why she is not able to have normal function of her digestive system and this is a high tech way of looking into her without surgery.  Hopefully she only has a blockage or something that can be altered to help her out.  It is hard to know what they will find, if anything, but she will need your support and understanding and friendship what ever the outcome.    She may be helped by having her dietary needs looked into.  There are many unknown factors and hopefully one will be found to help her out.  She should keep asking questions so answers will be looked into.    Maybe, with her blessing, you can both do some research online as to what other doctors or patients have found for similar symptoms.  A rare medical need may be overlooked by a busy physician who is not familar with such an unusual case.     Best of health to you and your friend.|`|6HhO1Evfaa	Oh! That happened to my brother when he was about 12 in 6th grade!  Yes, it is normal for them to stick something down her throat, which I believe is a tube.  I am not too sure about the going to sleep part, maybe it is just because that is what that colonoscopy place does.  I think they are checking for diseased like IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).  My brother got diagnosed with IBS.    If it has not happened yet, do tell her not to eat ANYTHING for a few hours before the colonoscopy.  My brother did not do this and threw up during the procedure.  So please tell her if it hasn't happened!    I hope I helped.  I listed a website if you want more information about it.|`|pb7qPJcxaa	is she 13 years old?

WXExyAlWaa	Yes. Any dieting system that is extreme and combined with a distorted body image, obsession with control, determination to get down to unhealthy body weight, etc, is part of anorexia.|`|k3ZVZmBJaa	To be diagnosed as being anorexia nervosa, one must be at only 85% of the expected weight for their age and height.  In other words, they would weigh a total of 15% or more below what they should. AND, they would have to have a deep fear of gaining weight and/or distorted body image.  It is not enough to just restrict your eating; it has to be extreme and it has to be because you are afraid of being fat.  People put themselves on restricted diets all the time, but it does not necessarily mean they are anorexic.|`|EuCNBiq6aa	yeah, that sounds like pretty much the definition of anorexic.    Even if you weren't diagnosed as anorexic, you can still definitely have an eating disorder
Ti0q1Btiaa	Hadn't heard that, but there is a scorpion in Iraq that can.    One of our soldiers went to sleep in his cot.    He awoke covered in blood.

Those critters inject an anesthetic then eat their fill.|`|hOwkTiHAaa	it will change colors to like red and black cuz the poison is killing the cells|`|16vMIGPiaa	The venom of Vipers does indeed cause tissue necrosis, though because it's injected below the skin the venom starts 'digesting' muscle rather than causing skin to die.  By the time a victim exhibits skin necrosis, they've got much bigger problems.|`|F4FCBEgzaa	Usually, the type of venom that rots flesh is reserved for the arachnid family of insects. Spider bites or scorpion stings usually have that characteristic where the center of the bite will rot and turn black. It is because they do not chew their food so it must be liquefied prior to ingestion. The spider bites it's prey enough to stun it until it has trapped it in a case made of web silk where it is stored alive. When the spider is ready to eat, it will bite it again with much more venom that will begin to dissolve the trapped insect from the inside out. Once the innards are liquid the spider can then suck the nourishment from the carcass.|`|P3e2kJtwaa	yep yep yep. its a bummer but it can happen.

The needles can be re-used for a time or two...<br>  Check with the vet to see if there are any other options.<br>  <br>  He will be very thirsty, urinating a lot, may be hungry all the time or very lethargic...<br>  <br>  High fiber cat food over the counter is much more reasonable. It may not be the best in comparison, but maybe you can get the insulin and buy the over the counter food, which will work financially.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|8OqdoIHtaa	A cat would use such tiny amounts of insulin that it would be very cheap compared to the amounts needed by people. If you aren't going to treat it, then be humane and have the cat put to sleep. Leaving it untreated is not what your pet deserves. He will suffer if its not kept under control.

If they take your appendix out, it is usually done laparascopically (as long as it has not ruptured).  It is a quick and relatively routine procedure.

w07AUmeBaa	Unfortunately for girls to get muscle definition it is a harder than for us guys... <br>  <br>  Your BMI is pretty good so you are nearly there... you don't have to do anything too painful... you just need to be consistent and gradual.

Om9CFRpsaa	I have had fillings and oral surgery performed on me. 1) Call your dentist's office. Ask how many hours prior you are allowed to eat. 2) During the nitrous oxide treatment, you will feel relaxed and should be in a drowsy state after wearing a mask (briefly), which contains nitrous oxide. You may feel a little pressure (not painful) or nothing at all. You will know what is going on,if the dentist narrates, which they usually do.  You will feel relaxed throughout the procedure and may be in a half-asleep state, but you will not be asleep or loopy. It's standard procedure and not a big deal.  3) The procedure is not painful. The next day you may feel pain-ask the dr. for some Rx-strength tylenol.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	You will LOVE it! So fun!!!!|`|1aSrTpbhaa	Oh my gosh be so glad you are getting that.

Focus on big boy exercises like squats, dead-lifts, chins, rows, dips and military presses. work with a heavy weight using low reps. Try to consume between 1.5 to 2 calories daily per pound of body-weight. it takes a body-weight increase of 15 pounds to add and in to your arms. The reason is that your body tries to keep everything in proportion.

e0d78770d4a9419c98a1e175ba21a9bfaa	I have this same problem my dr was an osteopath, chriopractor, orthodontist, and pain dr. and had this problem himself. He was a very good dr. he told me the joint does not heal up. you can only wear a night guard at night and a splint during the day to try to correct your bite. You want to lessen abnormal wear on the joint. try to get the jaw back into the closest position to normal as possible. If you don't you can expect muscle spasams and nerve pain. My Dr. said aurthritis will always develop in a damaged joint. He always prescribed a certain pain med and muscle relaxant to all his patients. Use the splints regularly and use meds only when absolutly nessesary. A night guard helps you keep from grinding your teeth from the pain at night. and the day guard (splint) will level out your bite and keep it from falling back out of position. The more you wear them the less abnormal wear and tear on the joint and less nerve impingement. Posture plays a part in TMJ as well. 
688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	First of all, understand that there is a HUGE difference between Lactose Intolerance and a Milk Allergy.    Lactose Intolerance is very simple to control.  Simply take a lactase supplement, use lactose free versions of milk, etc.  Typically, lactose intolerance will bring about gas, bloating and other belly discomforts.    A milk allergy will bring with it MUCH severe consequenses.  Projectile vomiting, sweling of the lips and/or throat, hives, rashes and can be life threatening.    With lactose intolerance, it's simply the lack of enzymes to break down the milk sugar.  That's why a lactase supplement will help.  It breaks the sugar down for you.  http://www.lactaid.com/page2.jhtml?id=/l...    With an allergy, the antibodies in your body see it as a harmful substance and begin to attack it in effort to kill it.     If there is a chance he is allergic, you really want to have him tested to know for sure.  A milk allergy can be life threatening.   http://www.lactaid.com/page2.jhtml?id=/l...|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	there's actually a big difference between lactose intolerance and milk allergy.    Lactose intolerance is caused by the gut not producing enough lactase enzyme, which is an enzyme that breaks down the lactose SUGAR in milk. When the lactose sugar gets to the colon without being broken down by lactase enzyme, the harmless bacteria in the colon go nuts eating all the intact lactose sugar and they release lots of gas in the process causing you to have bloating, discomfort and, well, gas.    Lactose intolerance is uncomfortable, but not serious or potentially life threatening. The treatment is to drink milk that has already been treated to break down the lactose sugar (Lactose free milk or formula) or to take Lactaid pills which provide the enzyme needed to break down a serving of milk or dairy.    Milk allergy is completely different, and can lead to mild or life threatening symptoms. Milk allergy is caused by the body using IgE antibody to release histamine when milk PROTEIN is ingested, leading to allergic symptoms including things like a rash, itching, vomiting, diarrhea, wheezing, throat closing, swelling, etc. The symptoms vary in each person, and they can get worse or better with age. Most milk allergic people are preschool age or younger, and most, but not all people outgrow milk allergy by school age. Also, most food allergy symptoms occur immediately, or at least within 2 hours of ingesting the food. The primary exception is that people who have eczema triggered by a food allergy can see their skin rash flare a day or two after eating the food.    Keeping that in mind, it doesn't make sense for someone to tolerate lactose (sugar) free milk if they are milk allergic, because milk allergy involves being allergic to the milk protein, which is included in all cow's milk, even lactose free cow's milk.    the easiest thing to do is to ask your doctor to check for milk allergy. Either you can see a board-certified Allergist who is the best person to diagnose milk allergy, or if that's not possible, your primary care doctor can draw some blood for an Immunocap RAST test for milk, which should be sent to Quest Lab. There are lots and lots of other blood tests available, but their reliability is marginal to poor, and the results are not nearly as reliable.    you can find more reliable information about food allergy at www.foodallergy.org    there are plenty other food allergy websites out there, but far too many are not backed by real medical and scientific research, so be careful about believing things you read about food allergy on the web.    good luck!|`|GA1ESEcLaa	I am lactose and tolerant and when i drink milk i just get AWFUL nausea in my stomach, so bad that i think i could throw up.

Here is my typical diet which is low-fat high protein...great for minimizing fat and building muscle. <br>  <br>  its better to eat more than less...if you dont eat your body uses its muscles for energy and you lose your muscle, therefore, burning less calories during the day. eat when your hungry and stop when your full. cut back your calories maybe a few hundred...it helps me when i write out what i eat. don't EVER be discouraged though...tell yourself well at least i feel better from working out and if you keep encouraging yourself and being positive, you will probably end up pigging out less and being healthy and losing weight. plateus happen all the time during workouts btw. you need to change the workout and confuse the body if that happens. the BEST site ever is fitnessmagazine.com. you need to make a account and they have the GREATEST workouts ever. Go to search and type in 4 wk makeover and it gives you weight trianing and cardio workouts. I did the weight training the other day and I'm sooo sore!

An unfortunate necessity in our litigious society.<br>  <br>  The common misconception with an inversion table is that you actually want to hang completely inverted. That is usually not the case. First off, it is very uncomfortable to do so. Secondly it can cause or exacerbate cardiovascular, ocular and musculoskeletal problems.<br>  <br>  What you want to do is use it to create intermittent traction forces. <br>  <br>  To do this get it set up to where it is well balanced and you can control the tilt with fairly small arm movements. Once you can do that, start with your body horizontal (parallel to the floor). Next go head down about 45-50 degrees. This is around or a little past 1/2 way between full inversion and your horizontal starting position. Stay there for a few minutes then return to your starting position (horizontal) for a minute or two. Then repeat that cycle as much as you feel like.<br>  <br>  This creates an intermittent traction that is much easier on your body and more effective than the full inversion.  <br>  <br>  One word of warning- have someone around the first time or two while you get used to it. If you go fully inverted it can be difficult to get back up. |`|1cc6d771c3d973cd285bfce8ea2e0982aa	You are under a doctor's supervision & the doctor recommended you use one.

cDNWZGvhaa	Water is a vital component of any healthy diet, including weight loss regimens. Drinking more water is often recommended to help weight loss because, for example, drinking water before a meal can help to fill the stomach and decrease appetite.Early signs of dehydration may include a burning sensation in the stomach,stomach pain or the feeling of an ‘empty stomach’which can be mistaken for hunger pangs. Water is the ideal alternative to soft drinks because it contains no calories.<br>  In addition, it has been found that drinking 500ml of water can increase the metabolic rate by 30 per cent. This means that drinking an extra 1.5 litres a day could increase daily energy expenditure by approximately 200kJ. Although only a small increase, over the course of a year, this additional<br>  metabolic activity would burn 17,400kcal.Some of these calories are used by the body to warm thewater from 22 to 37degree celcius, so drinking colder water could use up even more calories! There is also some evidence to suggest that increased hydration encourages the body to breakdown fat.

Start with a 1/2 mile, then add a 1/2 mile a week until you are up to 5miles. 3-4 times a week, or more if you're serious. Start slow and work your way up. Also drink a LOT of water. It keeps you hydrated to get you the best results from your work, and it flushes your system, plus it makes you less hungry.|`|ZNuMrSPYaa	Do 50 sit ups and than do 200 jumping jacks.. you can spread this out like 25 sit ups in the afternoon and 20 before u go to sleep... and 100 jumping jacks in the morning and 100 at night....just make sure u ALWAYS do the sit ups first|`|iH5EvSOMaa	I found this on this website. <br>  No matter how you slice it, diet is a dirty word.

lpgaDJEyaa	No, It burns calories so you will lose weight (fat). You may gain mucles mass though which may make you go up on the scale some.|`|QKRCZuMYaa	any activity that burns calories can help lose weight.<br>  I read a recent study tht said doing cardio for 30 min then taking a  15 min break then doing anoather 30 cardo workout was proven to burn more fat than a straight 60 miin workout|`|tRzHYn5Kaa	No, it does not help in gaining weight. People always say that muscle weighs more than fat, and its true, but the fact is, is that when youre losing a lot of weight you are gaining muscle but at a slower rate than you are losing. However, after you have lost lots of weight and then start toning, you will get heavier, and that is your muscles. But jogging will not help you gain weight. If you want to gain weight, you can still jog but youll just have to eat healthy foods that are high in calories (most meats, milk, cheese, pasta, etc).<br>  <br>  Hope i helped <3 :D|`|rftNmwZbaa	no helps u loose weight <br>  if u eat poorly than that may seem so but no go out and run

46fe5b00ef602cd45a6243bc419f4716aa	I was on Met for 3 months from September to December last year before I stopped taking it. I did start to lose weight in the beginning and was thrilled, and then I started gaining, even though I was eating correctly. The medicine also gave me horrendous acne in addition to the gastrointestinal problems. I decided it wasn't the medicine for me and stopped taking it. When I stopped, I had withdraw symptoms (chills/sweats, headaches, nausea). <br>  <br>  Every person is different though. Some women love Met and swear by it. You should check out this site if you haven't done so already. The women are very supportive there and you can find answers to any of your questions: <a href="http://www.soulcysters.net." rel="nofollow">http://www.soulcysters.net.</a> There's even a whole section just about Metformin!
NXwigImAaa	Work out before you eat.  Lifting weights builds muscle by tearing them (breaking down the muscle) and then repairing it stronger (building it back up).  After working out, your muscles are bleeding from being torn or broken down.  You can feed your torn muscles after working out by taking supplements and/or eating protein. I always work out before I eat.  The best time to work out is in the morning when you get up, before you eat (if that is practical for your schedule).|`|60041585a09b26e28706e9097d4156a9aa	u eat really late<br>  it is said that you shouldn't eat after 8:00<br>  but an hour and half after eating is fine<br>  i work out at 9:30 too :)

1ce092ac069c4b5f8aee2f628b9465d8aa	I have been in a few units. The one I have been in most used to have a smoking room, which the staff never had to go into as pretty much everyone was allowed to keep their lighters. However they've closed it down now because of policy so you have to go out in the garden to smoke which isnt good because it gets pretty crowded down there now. There are two wards and pretty much everyone smokes (or they did when I was there) so it gets busy. It's not good because the garden (albeit with a ten foot fence) was the only place you could really go for anything close to peace in that place. Now there isn't anywhere. I think psychiatric units should be an exception to the smoking ban, unless it affects the health of the non smoking staff.|`|73d0008d849d12c100a2399a29d02913aa	That's interesting.  Where I am, you can still smoke in most psych units, though smoking indoors elsewhere is totally banned.  I will say that I suffer from depression and it gets WAY worse when I try to quit smoking.  At some point, I will overcome the addiction, but being denied nicotine (which is a mood-elevating drug, essentially) at a point where people are at their very worst (usually suicidal) is just ridiculous, and is likely to make their medical problems even worse!<br>  <br>  There is a time for me to quit smoking.  That time is when I am doing WELL;  not when I'm already volatile and unable to focus.  <br>  <br>  I will say that I felt bad for the nurses and doctors and patients who DON'T smoke.  That would suck, because they also don't let you have lighters in the psych unit, so you wind up lighting a cig at the desk and then walking to the smoke room.   I think one really easy way to make this better would be to create a secure/enclosed outdoor space where people can smoke.|`|712fc8b6701e0985853d5d8eb923ce48aa	I had a brief stay in a psych unit in the states.  If you were a smoker, you could get a nicotine patch.  I am a non-smoker so it wasn't an issue with me.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, they also had no caffeine either.  I had a terrible migraine the entire 72 hours because I didn't have my morning coffee.  So, not only was I depressed...I had a screaming headache.|`|8b2f3ac40cfec53e907e4f5e625b7f03aa	In units where people are detained against their will there should be areas provided where they can smoke, otherwise their choice whether to smoke or not has been taken away from them.  Support to give up smoking should be available if they want it and non-smokers shouldn't be subjected to their smoking as they have rights too.|`|Q6EUug2laa	Yes I worked in a Unit and thus was subjected to breathing smoke for nearly 20 years ! It should be stopped for both patients and staff health.
AA12255511	as I type this my head is tilted to the side, to avoid a head ach as I cant stand to live life lying down any more. I had a spinal tap one wk ago tomorrow.<br>  These things are the devil, if I knew about these head achs I would never have done the tap. I went back into the hospital the other day and was readmited for the same reasons as you, only I was throwing up and couldn't even sit without getting an instant headach that was the worse ever!! The minute I would lay down it would go away though. Weird. <br>  There is a blood patch they can do that is suppose to take away this night mare but there is a catch. A new doctor told me he didnt want to do it unless I absolutly had to because they cause extreme, like very very extreme back and neck paion. Its taking blood from like my arm and injecting it into my spin, where it doenst really belong but it patches up where they went in, chances are we have air in that hole now and is why we have these headachs. Like you, they had to go in more then once because they couldnt get fluid. Nice, huh? <br>  When I was readmitted they gave me another IV and hooked me up to these bags that had water and caffine in them. Then gave me mountain dew, it has the most caffine. Now I am home and given the mountain dew prescription, the caffine is supoose to help the headachs and do something with helping the whole process along. <br>  I'm slowly but surly getting better. Try doing this. Avoid the blood patch the best you can. The doctor told me its like trading one pain for another, blood patch being the worse pain. E-mail me if you just need to "complain" to someone, I know the need to :) it just helps sometimes and most dont really understand. <br>  Feel better friend, I'm sorry we are traveling in the same boat. Its a nightmare.|`|NcI5rTP3aa	you have to bear it till it goes away.

This was something a study at a medical school found out. They learned that it is not the flu as much as it is a weak immune system that causes us to catch the flu. The people that were under the most stress and getting the least amount of sleep were the ones with the weak immune systems and were the ones catching the flu.

Studies have shown that the best way to lose weight is not to starve yourself. Eat 25% less calories than normal and you will lose weight. After several months your weight loss may plateau and you may need to decrease total calories in your diet meal plan by another 10% to keep losing weight.<br>   <br>  Design your meal plan around foods that you enjoy but keep the total calories to a minimum. The average women meal plan should consist of 1200 to 1400 calories per day. This allows for good nutrition without feeling hungry all the time. <br>   <br>  Most men can lose 2 or more pounds per week on a meal plan between 1500 and 1800 calories per day.

I recently read you should consume as many grams in protein as you weight. The stuff I see that will hinder your weight loss are: Oatmeal, oil & rice. A couple of tips: Being hungry will backfire. Food is the key to keeping your metabolism turned on and working. Whatever you eat spread out your meals instead of just 3 a day, crank it up to 6 1/2 meals. And finally - you should try to burn extra calories too. Low carb is a great way to go for short term weight loss - but more importantly - you get thinner more than you lose weight. GOOD LUCK!

Vk7kkrcLaa	inflammation of the optic nerve (also known as optic neuritis) can easily be detected by an optician or an eye doctor. you do not always require a MRI.     if the part of the nerve close to the eye is affected then it shows up when we look into the back of your eyes. other signs of it are pain with eye movements. it also affects the way you perceive the colour red in the affected eye red looks more washed out compared to your normal eye. it also affects your contrast sensitivity and can cause blind spots in your field of vision.    you need to consult your optician asap as if it is optic neuritis they need to start steriod treatment asap

Once I tried eating 4-5 prunes with hot tea or coffee and it did the trick.  Eat whole grain breads, fruit, fresh veggies, popcorn, beans, cabbage, etc. on a regular basis.  Perhaps it's a side effect of a new medicine you're taking?  Hot liquids stimulate the colon.  Good Luck|`|kURMsRgvaa	Ultimately try not rely on enemas as this can cause alot of other problems. After 12 days the poo will be really impacted, better not to try an enema as it is likely to hurt. Use soft fruits like prunes, apricots, if you can't get them fresh then tinned is OK: also drink lots of water: stay away from white bread and processed foods. While there is the constipation, avoid any food like salad/raw vegetables or anything dry like toast or biscuits, as they will just make the problem worse. Coffee and tea can cause the stools to release from the bowel, as can spicy food, however take care not to inflame the condition.     Also sometimes when there is too much emotional or mental related stress, then constipation can set in. If something emotionally stressful happened about two weeks ago, then this is likely to be your body's way of reacting to the stress. Try to relax and tune into what the issue may be that caused this, acknowledge it and let it go. Then it is likely that the poo will release of it's own accord, because you got the message that your body is possibly trying to tell you. Are you holding onto a situation/person/point of view that could be looked at in a different way?      Also try lying down, massaging your large intestine lightly starting from the inside point on the right side of your hip bone, up the right side lightly massaging the ascending colon, across the area under the belly button in a straight line to the left and then down to the inside area of the left hip.This light circular movement will stimulate peristaltic action of the colon, meaning it will cause you to poo, hopefully within 5 - 10 minutes. Drinking water before doing this also helps.
2OQuDVYvaa	Over the counter disposable enemas (Fleet) work to clear the rectum.  The chemical solution is what cause the irritation and burning you are complaining about.  The chemical is drawing water into the rectum to assist the stool in softening and stimulate a bowel movement.    I prefer a slowly administered large volume (1 to 2 quart) tap water enema with a teaspoon to tablespoon of salt added per quart.  It will reach further into the colon and doesn't burn. You can go to a pharmacy and purchase a combination hot water bottle, douche/enema syringe (Walmart sells for $4.99).     A large volume enema needs to be administered slowly. Since, you are new to this I would suggest starting with only a quart. There may be some cramping; but, stop the flow and start again after the cramp passes,  The bag should be hanging about 18" to 24" above the anus and you lying down on your left side. If you start to cramp, stop until the cramping subsides. After the bag is about 1/3 empty, roll either to your back or stomach and then administer the next 1/3 bag and finally you roll to your right side for the rest. After wards lie there and try to retain it for as long as possible (5 to minutes) as it will be saturating the stool. That should clear it out.     Those over the counter packaged enemas don't have the same effect.|`|J4W68owgaa	Sweetie, don't use an enema.    Try drinking fruit juice or eating any of these:       1. Raspberries     2.

Wiki lists that it "is a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It was developed and is being marketed by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. It acts by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, an enzyme that regulates blood flow in the penis. Since becoming available in 1998, sildenafil has been the prime treatment for erectile dysfunction; its primary competitors on the market are tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra)."    I've heard that some men like to use it recreationally, but any sort of drug can cause problems (side effects) as well, so it's normally not a good idea to use a drug you don't need.   Wiki also lists "In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects of sildenafil use included headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision. Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In May 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found that sildenafil could lead to vision impairment and a number of studies have linked sildenafil use with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.    Rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include priapism, severe hypotension, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, increased intraocular pressure and sudden hearing loss. In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss as the result of these postmarketing reports."

You need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food.

I chose it over the mirena because its hormone free (my hormones are great, i don't need anything messing with them -- which is one reason why I didn't want to go on the pill).  The insertion pinches for just a second and then it's over with.  Really not a big deal and it lasts for 10 years, unless you choose to have it removed. The string cannot be felt by your partner.  Your doctor will make sure its the right length such that it cant be felt by him, but you can check it each month to make sure it's in place.  The only side effect:  you periods will be a little heavier, especially the first 6 months.  Then it settles down again. My husband and I have one child (2 years old now) and this has been a fantastic option for us.  Good luck.|`|vhFnxBNeaa	no none of thats true. I know a few people with mirena you cant even feel it|`|AA10093245	Yes it hurts a little bit, but nothing you can't stand, and it's over in a minute. There is cramping afterwards, but nothing more than period cramps (unless something is wrong) You will bleed a little heavier at first, but it usually goes back to normal after a few months.  Yes, oftentimes the man can feel a little prick or sting if he bumps the end of the string, which can have sharp edges like a piece of cut nylon fishing line. If you have any of these problems, go back to the doctor.  I had a copper 7 implanted. I ended up with a perforated uterus and having a D&C, but I guess I am one of the rare exceptions.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	Yes, but I heard if you've had children it isn't as bad.

RleNFBuIaa	Ok so you have lost quite a lot since Jan but you want to continue that trend?  Well done but i thinking you still have more work to do!   I am also guessing since you have done the work and seen the results then you know probably have more motivation to continue on till you lose to about the 160 mark.   I advise for you is keep doing what you are doing... it must be working!   Don't fall of track and when you do suffer from a lack of motivation try and write down some goals that you want to achieve! Just keep reminding yourself about what you want to do with your body!   I also advise on a bit of gym work but that puts a lot more muscle weight on your body! But the good thing is that it raises the metabolism meaning you will burn more energy!   I guess it's up to you!     Good luck and keep at it!

Inversion therapy sounds like it could be perfect for you.  Inversion therapy is when you hang upside down with gravity boots or on an inversion table and the weight of your body pulls your spine or elongates it so that your spine can straighten out and go back into alignment and straighten up.  This will also fix your posture problem.  Once you begin to invert your spine will get used to being straight and will stay that way after a while.  If you invert you can also do mini crunches to strengthen your spine and to build the muscles in your back.  Inversion therapy is the best thing for you sweetie.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry.  Here is where you can get some good info.

fd821b24200f8a88262c7fffef0051f1aa	Hi  I am speaking as a dental nurse and a patient who has had a root treatment carried out.<br>  If your dentist is a good one there should be no pain what so ever. If you are experiencing pain during the procedure tell your dentist and they will top up your anaesthetic.The most uncomfortable part is holding your mouth open for so long.You will have a rubber dam placed over your mouth so no water or debris goes into your mouth this makes it a bit more of a pleasant experience, <br>  Taking a Valium is a very good idea and having a good breakfast is also a key part.What ever you do try not to have the tooth extracted its better in the long run.You may need to have a crown placed over the tooth. This is expensive but you are already investing in the root treatment so it makes sense, you dont need to have the crown done for 6 months after the root treatment.<br>  Hope this has helped but the main thing to do is not to worry.|`|0e69e633c962630db3bd74f6bafde350aa	No it is not painful, I have had 2 root canal's done.

X|`|2LX58MFSaa	hi<br>  root canal doesnt hurt, its the toothache before hand that hurts, and when you hav an abcess, it stops the anaesthetic from working, therefore it will hurt. but if your tooth is already dead it wont hurt. its just uncomfortable keeping your mouth open for an hour at a time, so ultimately, getting the tooth extracted is a hell of a lot worse.<br>  you have nothing to worry about. trust me.|`|BSUo08KKaa	eat lots of cereal and pasta! great confidence booster! and gets rid of nasty things in the mouth.ok|`|y4et0hlPaa	Hi its not that bad really. the worst bit is being scared.

Typically angina pain is a constrictive type of pain that will start in the center of the chest, and then spread to the left side.

Individuals with anorexia are known to commonly control body weight through the means of voluntary starvation, purging, vomiting, excessive exercise, or other weight control measures, such as diet pills or diuretic drugs. It primarily affects adolescent females, however approximately 10% of people with the diagnosis are male. Anorexia nervosa is a complex condition, involving psychological, neurobiological, and sociological components.[1]<br>  <br>  The term anorexia is of Greek origin: a (α, prefix of negation), n (ν, link between two vowels) and orexis (ορεξι?, appetite) thus meaning a lack of desire to eat.[2] A person who is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is most commonly referred to with the adjectival form anorexic. The noun form, "anorectic" is generally not used in this context and usually refers to drugs that suppress appetite.<br>  <br>  "Anorexia nervosa" is frequently shortened to "anorexia" in both the popular media and television reports. This is technically incorrect, as the term "anorexia" used separately refers to the medical symptom of reduced appetite (which therefore is distinguishable from anorexia nervosa in being non-psychiatric).<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Diagnosis and clinical features <br>  1.1 Presentation <br>  1.1.1 Physical <br>  1.1.2 Psychological <br>  1.1.3 Emotional <br>  1.1.4 Interpersonal and social <br>  1.1.5 Behavioral <br>  1.2 Diagnostic issues and controversies <br>  2 Causes and contributory factors <br>  2.1 Physiological factors <br>  2.1.1 Genetic factors <br>  2.1.2 Neurobiological factors <br>  2.1.3 Nutritional factors <br>  2.2 Psychological factors <br>  2.2.1 Social and environmental factors <br>  3 Prognosis <br>  4 Incidence, prevalence and demographics <br>  5 Treatment <br>  6 See also <br>  7 References <br>  8 External links <br>  8.1 Support organizations and information <br>  8.2 Media stories and reports <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Diagnosis and clinical features<br>  The most commonly used criteria for diagnosing anorexia are from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) and the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD).<br>  <br>  Although biological tests can aid the diagnosis of anorexia, the diagnosis is based on a combination of behavior, reported beliefs and experiences, and physical characteristics of the patient. Anorexia is typically diagnosed by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist or other suitably qualified clinician. Notably, diagnostic criteria are intended to assist clinicians, and are not intended to be representative of what an individual sufferer feels or experiences in living with the illness.<br>  <br>  The full ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa can be found here, and the DSM-IV-TR criteria can be found here.<br>  <br>  To be diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa, according to the DSM-IV-TR, a person must display:<br>  <br>  Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height (e.g., weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of that expected). <br>  Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming obese. <br>  Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight. <br>  The absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles (amenorrhea), in women who have had their first menstrual period but have not yet gone through menopause (postmenarcheal, premenopausal females). <br>  Or other eating related disorders. <br>  Furthermore, the DSM-IV-TR specifies two subtypes:<br>  <br>  Restricting Type: during the current episode of anorexia nervosa, the person has not regularly engaged in binge-eating or purging behavior (that is, self-induced vomiting, over-exercise or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas) <br>  Binge-Eating Type or Purging Type: during the current episode of anorexia nervosa, the person has regularly engaged in binge-eating OR purging behavior (that is, self-induced vomiting, over-exercise or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). <br>  The ICD-10 criteria are similar, but in addition, specifically mention<br>  <br>  The ways that individuals might induce weight-loss or maintain low body weight (avoiding fattening foods, self-induced vomiting, self-induced purging, excessive exercise, excessive use of appetite suppressants or diuretics). <br>  Certain physiological features, including "widespread endocrine disorder involving hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is manifest in women as amenorrhoea and in men as loss of sexual interest and potency. There may also be elevated levels of growth hormones, raised cortisol levels, changes in the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormone and abnormalities of insulin secretion". <br>  If onset is before puberty, that development is delayed or arrested. <br>  <br>  [edit] Presentation<br>  There are a number of features, that although not necessarily diagnostic of anorexia, have been found to be commonly (but not exclusively) present in those with this eating disorder.[3][1]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Physical<br>  Anorexia nervosa can put a serious strain on many of the body's organs and physiological resources,[4][5][6] particularly on the structure and function of the heart and cardiovascular system, with slow heart rate (bradycardia) and elongation of the QT interval seen early on. People with anorexia typically have a disturbed electrolyte balance, particularly low levels of phosphate, which has been linked to heart failure, muscle weakness, immune dysfunction, and ultimately death. Those who develop anorexia before adulthood may suffer stunted growth and subsequent low levels of essential hormones (including sex hormones) and chronically increased cortisol levels. Osteoporosis can also develop as a result of anorexia in 38-50% of cases,[7] as poor nutrition leads to the retarded growth of essential bone structure and low bone mineral density. Anorexia does not harm everyone in the same way. For example, evidence suggests that the results of the disease in adolescents may differ from those in adults.[4]<br>  <br>  Changes in brain structure and function are early signs of the condition. Enlargement of the ventricles of the brain is thought to be associated with starvation, and is partially reversed when normal weight is regained.[8] Anorexia is also linked to reduced blood flow in the temporal lobes, although since this finding does not correlate with current weight, it is possible that it is a risk trait rather than an effect of starvation.[9]<br>  <br>  Other effects may include the following:<br>  <br>  Extreme weight loss <br>  Body mass index less than 17.5 in adults, or 85% of expected weight in children <br>  Stunted growth <br>  Endocrine disorder, leading to cessation of periods in girls (amenorrhoea) <br>  Decreased libido; impotence in males <br>  Starvation symptoms, such as reduced metabolism, slow heart rate (bradycardia), hypotension, hypothermia and anemia <br>  Abnormalities of mineral and electrolyte levels in the body <br>  Thinning of the hair <br>  Growth of lanugo hair over the body <br>  Constantly feeling cold <br>  Zinc deficiency <br>  Reduction in white blood cell count <br>  Reduced immune system function <br>  Pallid complexion and sunken eyes <br>  Creaking joints and bones <br>  Collection of fluid in ankles during the day and around eyes during the night <br>  Tooth decay <br>  Constipation <br>  Dry skin <br>  Dry or chapped lips <br>  Poor circulation, resulting in common attacks of 'pins and needles' and purple extremities <br>  In cases of extreme weight loss, there can be nerve deterioration, leading to difficulty in moving the feet <br>  Headaches <br>  Brittle fingernails <br>  Bruising easily <br>  <br>  [edit] Psychological<br>  Distorted body image <br>  Poor insight <br>  Self-evaluation largely, or even exclusively, in terms of their shape and weight <br>  Pre-occupation or obsessive thoughts about food and weight <br>  Perfectionism <br>  Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) <br>  Belief that control over food/body is synonymous with being in control of one's life <br>  Refusal to accept that one's weight is dangerously low even when it could be deadly <br>  Refusal to accept that one's weight is normal, or healthy <br>  <br>  [edit] Emotional<br>  Low self-esteem and self-efficacy <br>  Intense fear about becoming overweight <br>  Clinical depression or chronically low mood <br>  Mood swings <br>  <br>  [edit] Interpersonal and social<br>  Withdrawal from previous friendships and other peer-relationships <br>  Deterioration in relationships with the family <br>  Denial of basic needs, such as food and sleep <br>  <br>  [edit] Behavioral<br>  Excessive exercise, food restriction <br>  Secretive about eating or exercise behavior <br>  Fainting <br>  Self-harm, substance abuse or suicide attempts <br>  Very sensitive to references about body weight <br>  Aggressive when forced to eat "forbidden" foods <br>  <br>  [edit] Diagnostic issues and controversies<br>  The distinction between the diagnoses of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) is often difficult to make in practice and there is considerable overlap between patients diagnosed with these conditions.

I wouldn't do so much and go so hardcore into this you're still young.  I would do like 100 jumps for jump rope and 50 crunches a day sounds good.  You will definitly not lose that much weight or inches off your waist.  You have a VERY tiny waist as it is!  This plan will only keep you looking as good as you do now, not make you skinnier.|`|d3c9e4814f1a4e439dee8535a8117ae8aa	I'm worried that at the moment all you're concerned about is aesthetics...  Whatever that date in August is about... a holiday or a date...  you need to lose weight to become healthy...  <br>  <br>  An adult female of 5ft should weigh about 100lb.  You are a teen, shorter than that and 20 heavier.<br>  <br>  Contrary to the belief of a previous poster a 32" waist is not skinny.<br>  <br>  15 minutes of cardiovascular workout isn't enough, you should be looking at 30 minutes 5x a week.  I wonder if you might be struggling with joint pain soon at your height and weight if the only exercise you do is high impact like skipping.<br>  <br>  Why not do one skipping session, one long bike ride of an hou or so and one half hour run (you can slowly build the distance).  If you're hoping that crunches will give you lean abdominals it doesn't work that way.  You would need to lose a considerable amount of body fat before your abs would become visible.<br>  <br>  Get real or by the time you're in your 20s you are looking at diabetes and heart disease...|`|vo4hFIkLaa	Be sure to get in enough lean protein as well. It feels you up and helps you lose. Typical weight loss is 1-3 lbs a week if you're working hard at it. You may want to do some weight training too (not too much weight at the start). Muscle burns more fat, but it also weighs more so the number on the scale may increase, but inches will decrease. Good luck! And remember to keep going, don't give up, if you work hard results will come so don't get discouraged!|`|RRS9WKiCaa	Personally, i would say do what u feel is bet.

RRS9WKiCaa	Health experts say we need to exercise the minumum of 30 mins a day. You just playing and babysitting and going outside for at least 2 is a lot. I would say ABSOLUTELY!!!<br>  but it might take a little time, i would say anywhere from 5-15 pounds, which is good if you think about it. Keep up the effort and try looking up or even making a fitness routine which u can do with the kids, whether that be playing tag or anything. Something fun and energetic will do the trick. <br>  Good luck and best wishes!!!
neJbYkJoaa	Yes.  There is an over the counter medication that used to be a prescription medicine for Urinrary tract infections.  It is called CYSTEX and it really works on most UTI's, but she will need to take it as directed on the box and take it for at least three or four days without missing any doses even if her symptoms go away.  <br>  <br>  CYSTEX is the only OTC medicine that can actually cure a UTI.  There are other meds sold for UTIs that will help the pain, but CYSTEX actually KILLS the germs.  It is a medicine that forms formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder and that is what kills the germs.  When a relative of mine called her doctor for a UTI, the doctors office told her to try CYSTEX first--that is how good it is.  It also has asprin in it, which acts as the pain reliever.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CYSTEX is usually sold at drug stores in the women's hygiene area, but some places don't carry it, and some are often sold out, so you might want to call the pharmacy and ask them if it is in stock.  It sells out quickly.  You can ask a pharmacist to special order some for your gf..  It is nice to have a box on hand for the next time a uti might pop up.  Cystex comes in a box and costs about $9.00 /box.  <br>  <br>  Again, it can be hard to find, so carry the name in your wallet when you go so you can show the pharmacist.  It really does work.  Drinking cranberry juice has been said to help prevent utis by changing the acidity of the urine, but it will most likely not cure a uti.  Have your gf also drink more fluids and wash before and after sex.<br>  <br>  ADD-ON:  <br>  AZO will only help the pain of uti, but Cystex actually has an ingredient that kills the germs in the bladder.  It does not kill germs in any other part of the body.|`|OaNxcJCeaa	Tell her to drink a lot of cranberry juice.  Not cranberry juice cocktail!!  That has too much sugar and could make it worse.  But there is no over the counter thing for uti's.  But cranberry juice  will definitely help!  There are antioxidents in it that clean out your bladder in a good way.  Also, she needs to make sure that she showers well after sex.  That is probably what caused it.  The built up germs and bacteria infected her urethra because she didn't shower or urinate right after sex.  <br>  So, just tell her cranberry juice and water.  No sodas or sugary drinks!  And be sure she pees after sex cause that will get rid of anything that may have gotten caught up in there.<br>  <br>  Hope she feels better soon!<br>  The cranberry juice should clear it up in less than a week.|`|1ghGuysoaa	Well, if you're in the US, you can't buy antibiotics over the counter, but you can buy a product called AZO-Standard that will help relieve the pain.<br>  <br>  But with that kind of infection it's really best to go to the doctor...she should try to get the money together for an appointment...good luck.|`|nQhDrfblaa	cranberry pills for the infection itself,  AZO for the urinary pain.  no intercourse until it's cleared up.  lots of water.|`|YNYYiVHYaa	The herbs hydrangea and marshmallow are good for UTI's.

rUQg4cKXaa	if your period is still heavy, then you definatley need to see a doctor.  My cousin's parents thought it would go away but they waited like two to three weeks, by the time she went to the doctors, she got transferred to a hospital, then she needed 2 pints of blood transferred into her body.  Before all this happended, she was so weak, she could barley stand up.<br>  Please see a doctor before it is too late.<br>  <br>  Oh, after this all happened, my cousin had her period for like two weeks again, so she went back to the doctor, and was put on the birth control pill.  So that is what happened to her, hope this information helps.|`|X3DciXOmaa	Once I've had it for over 2 weeks! If you get irregular periods, this is normal, but if you get it every month and this is the first time something like this has happened, then you should see your doctor. I get my period every 3 or 4 months (which the doctor said is normal for girls my age and that it will get regular when I'm about 18) so that's the usual for me. If you're really scared, then you see your doctor, but they usually aren't helpful about this stuff!|`|eCNGfrr7aa	are you on BC?  if you have started a new berth control that is what it is.  another thing is that it is summer and some girls/women get longer periods in the summer and then they switch days and weeks and so forth.

Or have you been spotting for a portion of that time?  It's normal to spot for a few days before and a few days after heavy bleeding.  Nothing to fret.  If you have been experiencing heavy bleeding for ten full days I wouldn't sweat it, your blood may be thin.  Give it another two days to slow down, if not, call your doctor.
1IOu09xeaa	Could be anything. Here's a list:<br>  <br>  1. Check your medications. This is often a side effect.<br>  <br>  2. Check your stress. Weight on the chest can be indicative of high stress levels.<br>  <br>  3. Check any vaccines that you may have had. I had a huge problem with weight on the chest after I was vaccinated against pertussis (whooping cough). Again, this can be a side effect.<br>  <br>  4. Check your weight. If you are overweight, this could definitely cause problems with pressure on the chest. Likewise, being UNDERweight could cause problems as well.<br>  <br>  5. Check your medical history. Were you born with a heart murmer, a hole, or a heart valve that doesn't work properly?<br>  <br>  If none of these seem to be the answer, make an appointment with your doctor. You should probably get an EKG and get to the bottom of this. And, if any of these are the problem, you should probably check with your doctor anyway so that you can change prescriptions, figure out a better diet, get a stress test, etc.<br>  <br>  Also, when you go in, talk to your doctor about tachycardia. This is a condition where the heart speeds up for no reason at all and starts causing shortness of breath and pressure on the chest. This is a fairly normal nonlife-altering condition with prescriptions available for it. There isn't too much you can do to prevent it, many people (my father being one of them) are born with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dFGXCh7vaa	i don't totally know but::<br>  my cousin had this going on for about 3 years now. she still gets it. started at about 14. it turns out that her heart sometimes skips beats, so the heart tries to keep itself from doing that by putting more pressure and taking more energy. also, your diaphgram might be sore, tore, or pulled, especially if you're an athlete. if it keeps feeling like that, see a doctor. hope it gets better!! =][=|`|ggPfLdDQaa	It could be a respiratory problem,  asthma, or anxiety.<br>  <br>  I get those feelings when I am really stressed and have a lot of anxiety.<br>  <br>  The best bet for you would be to go to your family doctor and get checked out just to be safe.|`|nQhDrfblaa	Had you eaten recently?

Call a pharmacy just in case.|`|nQhDrfblaa	In the future, don't discontinue your metformin without first discussing it with your doctor.

nQhDrfblaa	The example measurements you provided are in grams/ deciliter.  Do you know what the measurements your doctor provided to you are being measured in?  There's no way to convert the information without knowing this.
JJlQvnefaa	You may have actually 'hurt' yourself in some way. The normal body will crave many more calories than that and so you may have some type of hormonal/chemical imbalance. Hunger is controlled by the brain and chemicals are responsible for alerting the brain when you should be hungry. If you starved yourself for a month, you may have tripped a switch that turns off that chemical alert. A doctor will check you out, make sure your levels are all normal and then suggest ways to jumpstart your appetite.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like youre in the midst of an eating disorder, though it may be mild, it will progressively get worse without treatment and support. It's easier to nip this in the bud now then wait even another month when you can really do serious damage.<br>  <br>  It's good you're asking for help because that means you're still treatable.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|nQhDrfblaa	Eat 5 small meals a day instead of 3 large meals.

bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	I got a scary call like this too once, it is really disconcerting, but I can;t say I've heard strange noises from outside! It could be someone trying to scare you deliberately or it could be a stalker. Stay close to your parents. If it makes you feel safer keep something under your pillow like a knife or hammer for defence so that you can go to sleep knowing you have something to defend yourself with. Turn the radio onto a talkback radio station and turn it up high so it can be heard outside so it sounds like people are talking and leave a few lights on. I am sure you are safe, especcially as the police came around. But taking these precautions will ensure your safety and peace of mind for tonight. TOmorrow morning you can search the house outside more thoroughly and maybe get some clues, if there is a cellphone just lying outside someone may have linked the call so that when you called back it went to that phone deliberately scaring you. <br>  <br>  If after say 2 hours of tossing and turning, give up sleeping, it's not the end of the world if you don;t stay up and watch tv or something, do something that will calm your nerves, and nap the next day, take it off if you work or have school.|`|IvoaNyN2aa	the phone number should be able to trace it even if blocked|`|LSC6Crwjaa	Sounds like you may have a stalker.

Este método no es invasivo, por lo que no existe el riesgo de infección propio de otros procedimientos de poca esterilización. <br>  <br>  Electrólisis convencional: mixta o galvánica, suele considerarse el método más fiable y eficaz para eliminar el vello indeseado permanentemente. <br>  <br>  Electrofóresis: el procedimiento para eliminar el vello más innovador disponible en el mercado y que goza de una gran popularidad en Europa. Su funcionamiento es similar al de un sistema transdérmico, pero utiliza líquidos inhibidores del crecimiento mucho más potentes. <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...|`|zGQIV38daa	yo  creo  que  esa  respuesta  no  la <br>  <br>  tengo  pero  si  quieres  mas  informacion<br>  <br>  consulta   a  un  profesional    ok ?  suerteeeeeee

If there's a lot of members in your family that have gotten them, then there's really not much you could do to get rid of them. Although, there are things you could do to diminish the appearance of stretch marks. Cocoa butter is definitely helpful. You should also always apply lotion on your skin every day to improve the elasticity and  to prevent any future marks. Another thing you could do is cover them with a tanning lotion (natural tanning in the sun works too)|`|ZyngQcgxaa	coco butter, bio oil and some sort of laser treatment, cant remember the name. Also a heathy tan can make the lines look less obvious<br>  <br>  ps. PLEASE dont be self conscious about it. this is who you are. i went my entire teen years covering my legs and arms cause i have very dry, red, spotty skin which i thought EVERYONE was looking at. <br>  <br>  No-One cares. please believe me. <br>  and if they do, thats their problem, they are obviuosly just being shallow and those sorts of people arent the ones you should be listening to<br>  <br>  dont waste your youth worrying about what others think about your skin.|`|0BOpMhRiaa	when i was about 15, i had the same problem. if they are white or ur skin tone it's usually from weight fluxuating. meaning gaining and loosing weight. it doesnt have to be gaining alot then loosing alot. in teen years things like this can happen, it;s pretty normal. but if anything you can always talk to your doctor too. there are skin creams out there like coco butter or moisterizers with trentioin and retin a, also vitamin e oil is really good(it's realy oily so make sure u rub in very good). there is stivecktin or something like that,just keep in mind it is expensive. and keep in mind, you may not be able to completely get rid of them, but you can decrease the appearance of them. good luck and hope u find your answer.<br>  <br>  :)|`|wmCvH7lvaa	it really doesn't matter. it doesn't make you less of a person or anything.. today i went for a swim at the beach in my bra and short shorts and i got stretch on my legs, thighs and hips. but i'm not fat or anything you can get stretch marks from wearing tight clothing too.<br>  <br>  use bio oil or go to the chemist and ask them to give you a good cream.. bottom line: don't get too conscious about it, everyone has it. if people are gonna judge you for that then well they're just stupid. :D :D|`|KeAyB5Ynaa	hey...i'm 14 and i have them in the SAME areas...just not as much on my knees...around my butt and upper thighs<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  <br>  but dont sweat them because it usually just means you dont have stretchy skin...mine are hereditary<br>  <br>  <br>  but try cocoa butter!|`|303c5314078efbceceef392a7f0c10daaa	coco butter use it twice a day and if that don't work they have this cream for stretch marks to make them lighter..|`|y6sc6pxQaa	they make speical creams for it i use it on my shoulder......or u could try coco butter i herd it works hope i helped
BhzCW1rYaa	I stumbled across this question by accident, but I was married for many years so I know a bit about these things...It sounds to me like you have what is called a yeast infection, as stated above, you had best see your Doctor as this can be cleared up very quickly and give you back your old self esteem..<br>  )O( |`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	First you should never need to wash "in there".  It is a self cleaning organ and needs no cleaning agents or water to keep it clean.  <br>  <br>  If your hygiene is good, and it smells that bad, yes you need to be checked for some type of infection.|`|avXfyMvYaa	If it is real serious use steel wool and rinse with lemon juice.  the lemon juice neutralizes most smells, and the steel wool massages the pores in the vaginal area, opening them, making them more susceptible to the freshening of the lemon juice.|`|Zfon9O3Baa	Try using a douche, and if it is still smelly after the douche, then you may have an infection and need to see a doctor... The vagina usually needs very little maintenence, it cleans itself.

UrSushkJaa	It sounds to me like she may very well be allergic to latex. This is something she should see her doctor about. You can try KY Jelly but I don't think anyone can guarantee that it will help you.<br>  <br>  Something she might want to try is taking a condom and resting it on her exposed skin for an hour or so and seeing if she has any sort of reaction to it. However really she should talk to her doctor, as soon as possible. It may be embarrassing but it's a lot better than sex being a painful thing for her, it's not fair that she should be suffering through what should be a very pleasant experience.|`|YSahnI9Maa	I have found a box of chocolates, a nice dinner and some flowers works wonders.|`|luCReaXcaa	Yes, KY has several products on the store shelves: jelly, lotions, oils.

is0ON3lgaa	Is the lump or bump close to your vaginal opening or right at the vaginal entrance?  Many women can develop a harmless cyst in this area.  There is no real treatment for it unless a doctor feels it is necessary.  You can try a warm compress and see if that helps any.  If it is a cyst on the vaginal opening it may take a while to go away.<br>  <br>  You should see your gynecologist for their opinion just to be sure it's nothing serious.  |`|df54f1044a5b499adb758231bb8e4a90aa	I get those every once in awhile. It could be a cyst (if it is on the cervix) or a pimple (if it is on the vulva, which would be the flappy thing you are refering to). They come and go.  If you have had multiple sex parteners recently, you may want to get it checked out. If you are a virgin or have been in a monogomous relationship for awhile, you are probably clear of STDs. |`|BttalmMqaa	If not painful no problem take care .You can take doctor's help if more days take to solve|`|PgMZQ9Vyaa	I have the same exact thing.

Most stones can be treated without surgery. Drinking lots of water (two and a half to three litres per day) and staying physically active are often enough to move stones smaller than about five millimetres out of your body. You may be prescribed paracetamol or codeine to reduce the pain.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may ask you to catch the kidney stone by passing your urine through filter paper or a tea strainer. The stone can then be analysed to find out what type it is to help guide your treatment.<br>  <br>  |`|Jwfbel1Caa	ok im sorry to hear that well one method is to operate and take it out he would be in there for 1-2 weeks the other is more painful but you dont have to stay in hospital long its ti be taken out from the bum.<br>  Dr D<br>  good luck.|`|YMqratN3aa	a very painful operation.|`|76AdnYl2aa	try this site for treatment|`|XXdlvm4daa	its usually drink lots of water and try to pee them out if possible, but depending on the size this may not be possible. He should also have been prescribed painkillers as well to help. If he is not able to pee them out, a procedure called lithotripsy can be performed, where high frequency ultrasound waves are fired into the stone to break it up after which they can be passed out in the urine. if the stone is too big or the stone is not suitable for this treatment, he will need an operation to remove the stone, which is usually no more than two weeks in hospital.<br>  <br>  <br>  last bit of advice, cranberry juice can be very helpful because it is a natural diuretic and I think I am not mistaken when I say it can help break up stones, but Im not sure about that. still it will help because it will make him pee|`|VtZQPWoBaa	Laser technology is fairly safe, though expensive!

Drinking lots of water will also help (2-3L a day as a min!).<br>  <br>  the treatment with sound waves can also be used and is called lithotripsy. The sound waves shatter the stones into little bits so they can be passed out in the urine. It is not an invasive procedure and is pretty successful<br>  <br>  However bigger stones arenot suitable for this and require surgical excision. these decisions are made on the basis of the ultrasound report so I would consult your physician about whether any of the above treatments may be of benefit instead of just waiting for it to be broken down (unless that is of course what you have been told!)<br>  <br>  |`|Kkwi7urhaa	Thankfully, I've never had a kidney stone, but I've heard that radishes work:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radish#In_medicine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radish#In_m...</a>|`|13Ok3cuUaa	Who knows!

I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

I commend you for wanting to get into a field that will be helping someone. You sound like you also have brains and I suggest you look for a job in the field that you excel in. Good luck.
AA11130603	Maybe a few good walking DVDs  or tapes from Leslie Sansone might be the answer.You only need a few feet of space and if your little ones can walk, they could join you as well.

teQcd5tiaa	Well, for teenagers like me, it's a release of sexual tension that can't really be released in any other way. It's also a new sensation to us because our body's are developing. In older guys, it's probably just that they need a to release sexual tension too. Also some doctors say it helps keep good health.|`|tMt5qBURaa	Sometimes doctors perscribe it due to the association of lack of sleep which can cause mental illnesses ,it's also healthier than sex as you can't get aids and even monkeys do it so the idea it's againts natural instincts is very wrong and was falsely spread around by the catholic church. |`|s7siJltwaa	Why don't you?

Since orgasm creates a feeling of well being, it keeps a person a little more stress free all the way around.<br>  Masturbation also helps women keep the muscles of their vagina's in top condition since orgasm makes the muscles contract. This ensures you will always have a "tight" fit.  There should be no guilt when you masturbate, it is as old as humans are and everyone does it.  This is something that you will eventually even be able to share with your significant other so that you each learn exactly what and where their "special" places and erogenous zones are by watching what they do to themselves.  |`|iizKx4Bvaa	It is a natural thing to do.

AA10299265	Pain in the stomach? No<br>  Peeing a lot? Yes<br>  The others? Perhaps.<br>  <br>  Being overweight is not a prerequisite for becoming diabetic. Eating a lousy diet will get you there quicker than anything.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about becoming diabetic and/or want to live a long and healthy life, this is a good time to learn how to take care of yourself by checking out my web blog: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/Type_II_Diabetes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/seabulls69/Type...</a>|`|AA11434633	Was it not explained to you when you were suffering gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) that you are at more risk of developing full blown diabetes mellitus at some stage of your life?<br>  <br>  You should remind your doctor of this, mention the symptoms that are presenting themselves, and ask him/her if they will test you for diabetes.<br>  <br>  I wish you the very best of luck.|`|AA12266052	Often diabetes mellitus presents with the classic symptoms of polyuria (excretion of an excessive amount of urine), polyphagia (increased appetite) and polydipsia (incresed thirst), coupled with weight loss.<br>  Consult your family doctor.|`|hXO7xKkVaa	symptoms of diabetes<br>  <br>  The classical triad of diabetes symptoms is polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia, which are, respectively, frequent urination, increased thirst and consequent increased fluid intake, and increased appetite. Symptoms may develop quite rapidly (weeks or months) in type 1 diabetes, particularly in children. However, in type 2 diabetes symptoms usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or completely absent. Type 1 diabetes may also cause a rapid yet significant weight loss (despite normal or even increased eating) and irreducible fatigue. All of these symptoms except weight loss can also manifest in type 2 diabetes in patients whose diabetes is poorly controlled.<br>  <br>  When the glucose concentration in the blood is raised beyond its renal threshold, reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubuli is incomplete, and part of the glucose remains in the urine (glycosuria). This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst.<br>  <br>  Prolonged high blood glucose causes glucose absorption, which leads to changes in the shape of the lenses of the eyes, resulting in vision changes; sustained sensible glucose control usually returns the lens to its original shape. Blurred vision is a common complaint leading to a diabetes diagnosis; type 1 should always be suspected in cases of rapid vision change, whereas with type 2 change is generally more gradual, but should still be suspected.<br>  <br>  Patients (usually with type 1 diabetes) may also initially present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), an extreme state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by the smell of acetone on the patient's breath; a rapid, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing; polyuria; nausea; vomiting and abdominal pain; and any of many altered states of consciousness or arousal (such as hostility and mania or, equally, confusion and lethargy). In severe DKA, coma may follow, progressing to death. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency and requires immediate hospitalization.<br>  <br>  A rarer but equally severe possibility is hyperosmolar nonketotic state, which is more common in type 2 diabetes and is mainly the result of dehydration due to loss of body water. Often, the patient has been drinking extreme amounts of sugar-containing drinks, leading to a vicious circle in regard to the water loss.<br>  <br>  so u decide|`|8e88c6da71fe8f14e7562b31ce069d5aaa	Could be. Sounds about right. Ask your doctor, its a very quick test, and you will be on your feet again in no time if thats the problem. It sounds like your pancreas could be a bit dodgy anyway. |`|CbYw3jFZaa	Just ask for a diabetes test another symptom is extreme thirst and running to the loo. Maybe you should eat little and often to keep your blood sugar level up|`|fys4qM9Faa	Frequent urination, excessive thirst, feeling tired and changes in weight are the classic symptoms of diabetes.
nDHehYfLaa	LASIK eye surgery isn't right for everyone. You need to meet certain requirements before submitting to LASIK eye surgery.<br>  <br>  Here are a few of the guidelines used in determining if LASIK is a good choice for you -<br>  <br>  * You should be over 18 years of age.<br>  * Your corneas must be healthy.<br>  * You should not have had a significant change in your lens prescription in the last 12 months.<br>  * Women should not be pregnant or breastfeeding.<br>  * You should be in good general health.<br>  <br>  If you are nearsighted, LASIK eye surgery can work for you. <br>  <br>  Farsightedness was previously not treated with LASIK, since reshaping the cornea to focus on nearby objects came at the expense of losing the capability to focus on distant objects. However, a new procedure has been developed that enables people that are farsighted to benefit from LASIK eye surgery.<br>  <br>  The end result is that you can now see both near and far in proper focus. In almost all cases, you'll be able to say 'Good Bye' to those bothersome reading glasses! |`|0cMZUMIcaa	I have not but two of my close friends have and they are both happy with the results.<br>  <br>  One friend, female - 27 - Colorado, doesn't need glasses at all any more...<br>  <br>  The other, female - 25 - Phoenix, does need glasses once and a while but it is rare that she can't see something. <br>  <br>  I've heard both good and bad on the news about lasik but in general, everyone I know has had a very good experience. |`|XGRbvVlFaa	I had it about 10 years ago, best investment in myself I've ever made.  The entire procedure took about 10 minutes, they gave me a mild sedative - I went home & took a nap and when i got up, I could see!  Go for it!!|`|pqxiEo9Taa	Lasik eye surgey is great...it left me very sensative for a few days, but in the end it did wonders for my sight...i have 20/20 vision now...you should definitly get it!!! The procedure is very easy...its great|`|AA10845576	You should definitely go, my friend has had lasik done and she see better than ever. This is all I know about it: They put eye drops in to numb your eyes then they start the surgery - some people feel pressure on their eye during the procedure, other can experience sensitivity to light and their eyes will water for the next few days, and some get a sandy feeling in their eyes for a couple of days. <br>  I think its definitely worth doing that is if you are a good candidate for it. People say that the pain is mild but not because of the procedure but because of the things that open your eye ... im not quite sure what they are called. But what I know for certain is all of those people who have has successful lasik never regretted it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|PIcomI6Oaa	yah...lasik is good...ask ur eye doc for better advice|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	no but someone gave a speech about it in my speech class!<br>  they said their teacher had it done, and the teacher said it didnt hurt... they said you like watch a movie while the laser goes in ur eye, and it just feel like pressure.... i heard that they have to like cut something though and they can accidently cut it all the way off!|`|AA11373993	I've never had it done, but both my parents are opticians and they do NOT recommend it.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	85% of sore throats are the result of a viral infection. Virus's will not respond to antibiotics. Just take paracetamol and/or Ibuprofen for pain relief and push fluids. A honey drink will have no real therapeutic value, but it is soothing.<br>  <br>  Take paracetamol for pain relief. Do NOT gargle with Aspirin, which will irritate the already sore lining of your throat, the same goes for salt water. It will not have any therapeutic value. Chloraseptic or Diflam sprays might help any local discomfort|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Gargle with salt water.  Take some Bayer aspirin.|`|b44bfe862fdfa24dc2637363590f46bfaa	Shine a flashlight down your throat and look in a mirror. If you see an inflamed red throat with small light-coloured sores, chances are you have strep throat. If you have health insurance or can afford it, go see a doctor and get some antibiotics. (Unless you're allergic, try to fight for azithromycin. It's a 6-pill antibiotic; two pills the first day and one a day for the next four days. Very effective too.)<br>  <br>  It could also be allergies causing post-nasal drip which is irritating your throat. Look for a swollen red throat without sores. It can also be the cold season starting which is making your throat sore. In which case you can take Benadryl and it can block the allergens and help the throat. Careful, because Benadryl makes you drowsy. (Same ingredient as in Tylenol PM, just in a thicker shell.)<br>  <br>  Have you drank after anyone lately? They may have had a bug that they didn't even know about themselves.<br>  <br>  In any case, for instant relief, go buy some of that Vicks Chloraseptic spray and spray it as close to your throat as possible so the spray doesn't hit your tongue and dull your sense of taste for half an hour. Cough drops can also help, but not like Cepacol or Sucrets.<br>  <br>  You can also go to Wal-Mart and buy a vapouriser. They have one called Vicks WarmSteam (I had to buy one the other day) for $13.62. It's the cheapest Wal-Mart has, but it's good. Buy a bottle of Kaz Steam Activation Inhalant to pour in the medicine cup. (All in the same group next to each other.) The menthol vapours can sooth almost any bronchial ailment from the cough to the pain of strep throat.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with that. =]|`|AA10027852	I found the most AMAZING solution to this.  I have tried it three times and been blown away at its efficacy - 100% cure, including prevention of the cold that usually follows.  It's not comfortable, but it's OH SO WORTH IT!  This is what you need:<br>  <br>  - Cayenne Pepper (a type of red chilli powder from the herbs and spices section of the supermarket)<br>  - A small bottle<br>  - Water<br>  - A dash of courage!<br>  <br>  Add a level teaspoon (approx) of the Cayenne to about a cup of water in the bottle.  Swirl it around well.  Then:<br>  - Stand in front of the sink.<br>  - Tilt your head right back.<br>  - Pour some of the Cayenne water into the back of your throat. Gargle gently. Leave it there for a minute or so.<br>  - Spit it out.<br>  <br>  Repeat every 15 minutes a few times, then with more and more time between, until it's gone.  It's fine if you swallow a bit too.  <br>  <br>  The tilting of the head and the bottle is just to make it much easier to avoid contact with your tongue and the rest of your mouth.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

ltYhku4qaa	It is a condition called Osgood-Schlatter disease.  It is usually harmless, although I have sent one patient for surgery.  It is due to rapid growth and stress on the top of the tibia (the bone below the knee).  Ice, ibuprofen (800 mg every 8 hours) and a couple days rest is all that it usually takes, but occasionally I will use stronger meds.  |`|ymdPniDYaa	Sounds like something that I have.  My doctor explained that it was the result of an injury that I had when I was younger - apparently my knee healed in the wrong position.  Now I can entertain my friends and family with my bumpy knee - although it's hard like bone, I can move it back and forth and in and out.  Sexy, I know.  <br>  <br>  Ps.

A3u36Hqlaa	With irritable bowel syndrome, antidepressents are usually fairly common to perscribe because IBS is also a seratonin issue. as well as depression. Usually with IBS most people will get either constant constipation or constant diahrrhea. In your case before you went on prozac, you had the diahrrea...now you have constipation. So the meds could be too much for you.<br>  <br>  I would consult with your doctor about switching your medications or decreasing the dosage. And yes, there is going to be side effects with any drug you take...but if i were you i'd try the decreasing the dosage first. But that is between you and your doctor. If it is affecting you physically and emotionally then its time to do something about it. <br>  <br>  if your looking for a new drug i've heard good things about cymbalta and ativan.|`|qbbkaucbaa	Try Ativan. Worked wonders for me.|`|4eL7C596aa	Yes, there are a lot of other drugs............I would like you to ask you doctor about this.........this is not a drug......it's for your stomach and bowels.......it's very good and causes no pain........and works differently than everybody first thinks. It's the best thing that I ever had. It's called "Metamucil" and they have it in flavors now........the orange flavor is a nice taste......1 tablespoon in a glass of water, and stir and drink, and follow by a half glass of water for a chaser. Do it quickly. Just see what happens(ask your doc) All the older people I've been around believe that your bowels are the best things to get healthy first. You may find after a couple of weeks that you feel a lot better. Good luck.|`|59GGw0WAaa	The suns natural rays, a walk in a field of green grass, sing your favorite song, having sex and laughing every day. All prove to work for fighting depression. Man made solutions feed on the human insecurities and cause them nothing but pain and disappointment eventually leading the patient to blame themselves. Laughter is a key to life that people overlook. Laugh girl, laugh. |`|17iZXnyNaa	b4using any antidepressant, its better you now the ad effects and listen to other users as in <a href="http://internaldoctor.blogspot.com/2008/12/living-managing-anxietydepressionfearpa.html" rel="nofollow">http://internaldoctor.blogspot.com/2008/...</a>|`|nNCtHNepaa	If you are a minor, one of the main reasons you are on prozac and not another SSRI with fewer side effects is your age.  SSRIs such as (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), venlafaxine (Effexor), citalopram (Celexa), and fluvoxamine (Luvox) are proven to cause an increased likely hood of suicide and suicidal thoughts in teens. That must be taken into account. However, if you are not a minor, any of those drugs would probably have equally good effects on your depression and may or may not cause the drowsiness of which you complain. Talk to your doctor, see what she/he thinks. Also, in light of the many side effects you are having, it would be a really good idea to talk to a doctor anyway. Those all sound like a-typical side effects.|`|pIvN6TY7aa	I went of the SSRIs a couple of years ago, and started Welbutrin. <br>  <br>  Major improvement.

7tpAq9eWaa	Irregular periods are normal at the beginning of your cycles. But considering you've had it for 3 years, that's not the case. What does cause irregular periods later on is a hormonal imbalance. This can be caused by stress (maybe a heavy work load? Parents stressing you out? Guy stress?), a change in diet, antibiotics, physical exercise... Basically, anything which has an influence on the hormones, and how fast they can be produced etc.<br>  To get it normal, have a balanced diet (you can google it and find A LOT), don't work out excessively, try to stay calm, and if you are on antibiotics, then wait until you don't have to use them anymore. If you aren't aware of any changes like this, and you've been keeping everything the same, then go to your doctor, because it could be serious - not STD wise obviously, but there are also genetic (meaning heritary) issues which could be affecting your menstrual cycles.<br>  Good luck :)|`|2JxemmRKaa	You don't say how old u are or whether periods are new to you. If your period is a recent thing it is possible in the beginning for it to be eratic.If you are older it could be stress or diet/weight related. possibly a hormonal issue?|`|6sypT80Zaa	your body is probably still trying to figure out its pattern okay?<br>  |`|EGP6rUoIaa	Its Because Your Lucky<br>  I Wish Mine Where Like That<br>  Because Mine Really Hurt :S|`|NxtM0I4eaa	it sounds like a hormonal inbalance but also if you are under alot of stress that can sometimes throw your cycle out of wack. i would recomend seeing your doctor about getting on birth control, that can sometimes help to regulate your cycle.
7tpAq9eWaa	Apparently, the first period after pregnancy is really bad (cramp wise). And normally, you get the cramps about 1 or 2 weeks before the period. Also, as you haven't had your period in a while (obviously), you aren't used to the cramps, so they may seem worse than you remember. <br>  It could also be irrelevant to the period/pregnancy thing, and you could have some stomach bug. Go get checked by the doctor, then you'll know for sure. Good luck and congrats for the baby :)|`|DrlDqVZeaa	if it is too bad maybe you should go to the er to make sure it isn't an etopic pregnancy. Those won't show up on test for several weeks if ever. |`|wqbZbwpBaa	You could be pregnant because you had unprotected sex.

My family doctor told me it was my period returning and to wait it out which i did and a week later there it was. I was also started on alesse birth control pills to regulate my periods and make them less painful and irratable to me.

7tpAq9eWaa	I know how you feel. My mom, when I started my period (about 6 months ago) went completely awkward. She decided it was the time for her to give me the 6th billion sex talk. Plus we have sex ed in school. Ugh.<br>  Now, first, buy them yourself until you actually ask your mom. I actually told mine over the phone. I was like "hey, uh, mum, i started my period, can you go buy crap?" and then she was like oh okay but before she could go into detail i said okay gotta go bye. I was in school. Anyway, creative ways... write it on a note, put it on her shopping list without her noticing, ask your dad to buy them (they will NEVER ask questions - just make sure you specify which kind, because they have no idea). Just pretend like it's not a big deal, or she will go all "OMG HONEY!!!" on you. Just say yeah, uh, period. Can I borrow some pads/tampons? Thanks.<br>  Anyway, pads or tampons - the question.<br>  I haven't figured out tampons. Some people can use them straight away, but I can't. I would try them (the smallest kind first, obviously, and with applicator). Pads tend to be preferred during the first year or so, because most girls aren't comfortable with their body and can't figure out tampons. But pads get really annoying when you want to go swimming, or do exercise, and all that.

At first it's a little awkward but then you end up realizing that you get the same attention from buying tampons or a bag of rice! No one cares, so you shouldn't either.|`|z58pJSHfaa	lol tell her your hole is bleeding and you need something to plug it up.<br>  or if you don't get some pads, you're going to use her pillow cover.<br>  <br>  haha jk.<br>  <br>  when i was younger, it use to be really awkward with asking my mom as well. i finally broke the ice when we had this conversation...<br>  Me: "mom, can i have some money?"<br>  Mom: "for what??"<br>  Me: "to buy some cocaine, get a hooker, and rent a motel room for the night"<br>  Mom: *blank stare*<br>  Me: "haha, actually i need some freakin' tampons."<br>  <br>  lol so i'd suggest trying to make a joke about it and hopefully she'll kinda get the hint about making it awkward.<br>  <br>  otherwise, just tell her that she is making it hard for you to talk to her about it, i'm sure she'll understand and try to stop.|`|lRuM6GURaa	I feel for you.

7tpAq9eWaa	It is normal to have discharge everyday. Some people don't, lucky them. I have a heavy flow of both discharge and period when I do get it. Don't worry it's normal. Not much you can do... just wear a pantyliner and yeah. Try to drink more water because then it's not as sticky and gooey. :)|`|RkCkiyWNaa	I have the same issue and I've gone to the gyno a couple times, but she's never mentioned anything negative about it. The vagina is always cleansing itself, so it would make sense that it would excrete a little fluid. Whitish discharge is typicallyokay, but if it's more on the yellow-ish side and it has an unpleasant odor, then seek a professional opinion.|`|VPy7zXPHaa	it's perfectly normal. Pretty much everyone has it, including myself.|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	Its NOT normal ... You need to talk to a Doctor and get a check-up.
cd72a13e326e7a1e2a28b0943b687dc4aa	Plastic is more durable. If you do want to buy metal frames keep in mind that you should tighten the screws on the metal frame once a month. Metal screws on metal frames  have a tendency to loosen themselves more frequently than they do on plastic frames. Don't buy  wire frames with a thin front(thin around the lens area) if your lens are thick (it will be harder to keep the lenses in place).|`|qXH5WiWjaa	Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  Look at the frame when you are making your purchase and check for durability.  There are several types of 'flex metal' frames out there that are pretty durable.  Easy Twist is the best known out of them all.  <br>  <br>  Look for the same thing with a plastic frame.  A draw back to plasic is that the heat from your face will tend to widen your frame so it may mean more adjustments.  But again, look for quality.  <br>  <br>  I wear both types of frames so I don't have a preference for one or the other.  <br>  <br>  Just make sure that you look for quality and a shop that will back up their frames with a warranty.  All the frame manufacturers that my office deals with backs their frames up with a 1 year 1 time replacement as long as you don't negligently damage it yourself.  |`|2zGKZB6gaa	I love my plastic frames! I've worn glasses since childhood and have had all sorts of styles. I bought my first set of plastic frames about 3 years ago. They look great, they've never fallen apart and when it's cold outside they don't hurt my face! 
7tpAq9eWaa	When you get your period in the pool, it doesn't really make a difference, because normally you spot before you really start. Just go to the bathroom once in a while to check if you started. But really, you won't like bleed and make the whole pool red, so nobody will notice if you start spotting. Just check every hour or so, go to the bathroom and chck if you started, and if you did, say you have a stomach ache and prefer to sit out. Good luck!|`|J9KNeppbaa	to be safe you have a few options, either sit it out or use a tampon...or possibly a dark suit to help hide any accidents....they make smaller tampons for younger girls...hope this helps!|`|eZWU3yC6aa	it shouldn't come out when you are swimming but even if it does its only a bit of blood in a massive swimming pool, so nobody will notice anything, you probably wont either, the water stops the bleeding, but it is best to wear a tampon, because when you get out the water you might bleed.<br>   |`|25830f4950fb9af7ec5987557b332a9daa	If you think you might start just wear a light tampon. My mother used to tell me I couldn't take a bath if I had my period; this was back in the 1960's.  My girlfriend told me that as soon as you're in the water the bleeding stops. She was right. My mother was a little old fashioned.
GPif67oHaa	You did not give enough details , like how much alcohol a day, or is this one time ?  <br>  The liver has a very rich blood supply, and is, in most instances, a<br>  secondary metastasis (a spreading of a cancer) location from a primary<br>  cancer elsewhere. Simply  put, cancers from another part of the body<br>  prefer to migrate/spread  first to the lymphatic system, and secondly<br>  to the liver. Almost all (but not ALL) liver cancers originate<br>  elsewhere in the body. Multiple tumors are common.<br>  There is a difference between "liver cancer" and cancer in the liver.<br>  Cancers are referred to by the organ of origin: so breast cancer is<br>  breast cancer, whether it's in the breast or has spread to the liver.<br>  Liver cancer, strictly speaking, is cancer which begins in the liver.<br>  It can be cured (rarely) by removing that part of the liver in which<br>  it arises. What you are talking about, metastatic cancer, means it has<br>  spread to the liver from elsewhere, and therefore is nearly always<br>  incurable. The prognosis depends to some degree on the organ from<br>  which it spread: colon cancer in the liver sometimes grows slowly, and<br>  sometimes can have a dramatic response to chemotherapy. Pancreatic<br>  cancer, on the other hand, tends to grow fast and not respond to any<br>  treatment. So it will be important to know, if possible, the original<br>  organ; such knowledge might suggest a treatment plan. On some<br>  occasions, the origin is never found. Generally, people found to have<br>  metastatic cancer in their liver live between 3 and 6 months: there<br>  are occasional startling exceptions, and I've known patients who<br>  responded completely to chemo for metastatic colon cancer and were<br>  disease-free years late. That, in truth, is an extremely rare outcome.<br>  There are ways of treating tumors in the liver which show some promise<br>  for prolonging response with minimal "invasion," including heating or<br>  freezing the tumors with various probes inserted either with xray<br>  guidance or ultrasound during surgery -- "open" or laparascopic.<br>  
SEzUuA2vaa	No,your period does not stop when you go into water as you found out when you showered.|`|FvwmRtNjaa	lol, no, this is not true.|`|D1nWAN6Baa	That's not exactly true, because when you go in the water and the water takes the menstrual blood away, so basically it doesn't stop. It's that you kind of don't know your letting your menstrual blood in the pool. If your nurse said your period stops when you go in the water, that's false i'm positive it doesn't for past experience with myself. Her information she's giving you, like its taking a shower it washes away the blood but you just don't notice it.|`|koymw0cZaa	Madam,<br>  <br>  When you fully covered in a chilled water than it may cause period stop <br>  <br>  <br>  Menstruation is a woman's monthly bleeding, also called a period. When you menstruate, your body is shedding the lining of the uterus (womb). Menstrual blood flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix, and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days.|`|PMhR70Mgaa	It slows it down a LITTLE.

C64qGCQraa	You should work your legs out twice a week, but not for 2 hrs. It takes time to build leg strength, but even a total body workout should not take 2 hrs. Your age depends on how quickly you'll reach 315 almost as much as your workout does. Considering that is a 130 lb jump, it'll take a bit of time to reach that goal. Make sure you include a download week once every four weeks to make sure you don't plateau and to ensure that your body has a chance to recover completely from your workouts. Hope this helps.

RjmZkGAMaa	Im the same size as you and I have grown to love them!Boobs are great so make the most of them. As you get older you will appreciate them.  If youre blessed with big boobs then thats in your genetics.  At a 34'' you cant be overweight, so unfortunately your boobs wont shrink by doing exercise.  I exercise 5 times a wek and run half marathons and still no change!  Enjoy them, and make sure you wear a good supportive bra when you exercising to keep them in 'tip-top' shape xx|`|MIu7puZdaa	Surgery and losing weight are the only ways to reduce breast size unfortunately.|`|bFnx6n6kaa	hooray! for boobies!|`|TRGAOMsoaa	learn to love it.<br>  at least you're not cursed with 32a like myself.<br>  better to have more boob than no boob.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	You can get a minimizer bra, ask wherever you buy bras, and try a few on, see if any make you feel better...they basically are made to hold them in better and kinda disperse them some so they don't look as large.  It won't be a huge difference though.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, all you can do is get a reduction, unfortunately surgery's the only way to make them smaller UNLESS you're carrying some extra weight, then losing weight can make a dramatic difference -- don't go crazy and turn anorexic just for small boobs, yanno? But if you can safely drop some weight, try that, it will make them smaller by default.<br>  <br>  Again, if you can't lose much weight and still be healthy, then you're kinda screwed, because the difference with only 5lbs or so wouldn't be very big, I doubt you'd even change bra size.  Sorry! =o(<br>  <br>  Hopefully you can learn to love them.  It's hard, I've been there, but once you get older it DOES get easier!  Trust me!

Not to scare you from it, but just I know I thought it wouldn't be a big deal until I talked with a woman who'd had it done, she said she'd do it all again because she really was in pain from the size of hers, but that she wouldn't say it's a decision you should make over a short time span because it's a huge ordeal and she did get an infection and that made it much more painful etc., lots can go wrong -- big decision.  Don't make it too young! =o)|`|RJY6aRQ9aa	That's about the same size as me, first off do shed some weight IF you have any to spare, if you don't then you can probably get surgery done to reduce the size for free(in england anyway) only if they are causing pain. They tend to look to see if the straps are digging in alot and the weight of your breasts too.<br>  <br>  If it was me I would wait until I was at least 21 for the surgery. You probably hear this alot but only because its true your still young your developing and so on 15 is still early in the stage, you may only need to get comfortable in your body. Alright, another point to consider is that (from my experience) they keep on growing until your in your 20's, at least that is what is what it was like for me. I was a D/DD when about your age now I'm 36F, and I'm fine with being this size, but it doe's get hard to find bras that fit.<br>  <br>  Best advice is to look around, on the internet if you have to, go to the doctor and ask what you can do and then when you have the leg work done talk to your parents(has to be done) and decide what to do.|`|ALxvsSWiaa	Bad news - in all probability, they'll get bigger as you are only 15.<br>  |`|afdVg5PQaa	what you are saying goes against every single one of my principles.<br>  I am offended, shocked, and appalled.good day madam.|`|IVF4lyJdaa	go on a diet or work out fat tissue in the breasts get burned off with exercise even ifyou are not overweight|`|QcDN1Bizaa	do loads of excersize around your boob area.<br>  lose weight

This lady spoke about why girls these days have such big boobs, and it's because they're wearing tight bras and bikini tops. When you're at home, take of your bra! Losing weight could also help them get smaller as the fat cells in breasts keep a lot of tissue if you have any on your body. Other than that, just try to lead a healthy lifestyle, because maybe your body is just catching up to your breasts and they won't seem as big in a couple of years.

nckpVDcRaa	I've worked in the veterinary field for about 6 years now.  I can tell you that what you are probably dealing with is staff infection.  Staff are opportunistic bacteria that live on the skin all the time, but if will an cause the red bumps your talking about or little pustules that kind of look like pimples when the skin is irritated.<br>  <br>  There are a variety of reasons for the cause, but solution is usually a good antihistamine like benadryl, chlorpheniramine, or hydroxyzine and a good skin antibiotic like cephalexin or Clavamox.  <br>  <br>  You'll need to check with your vet about the dosage for the antihistamine which they may give you over the phone and the antibiotic can only be prescribed through a licensed vet.<br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't wait to contact the vet, because the infections tend to get worse if not treated.  The good news is that once you get the infection under control, you can keep the itchiness at bay with the antihistamines, which are relatively cheap and available over the counter.<br>  <br>  Avoid the Neem Oil that someone else suggested or anything like that.

7tpAq9eWaa	Well my mom was never really awkward.<br>  She tried to be, but I was like no, mom, it's okay, I just need some pads.<br>  See, I started 6 months ago (I'm 15), so I was more mature (no offence) and I was like okay mom I've had Sex Ed, I KNOW that I need to use condoms if I have sex.<br>  Yes, she thinks that just because you get your period, you're gonna start having sex.<br>  Mothers.<br>  I love her really.<br>  Anyway, just ask her. If you're really shy about it, write her a note, or make a little note on her shopping list, or when you're in the supermarket just put in some pads/tampons and when she gives you a weird tell her. Voila. She can't have the sex talk in a supermarket, can she?<br>  Anyway, wear pads the first few times until you can use tampons and until you're comfortable. Also, periods are really irregular at the beginning, so you won't know when it'll stop. With pads, you can always see if it stopped or not.<br>  Anyway, good luck!<br>  And you'll know when you get cramps.

You need to make sure that if you start when you go to your doctor check ups that you let them know. I know about the pain the comes with it because I have mistrial cramps.

XhJL7tnwaa	It sounds like a yeast or bladder infection. <br>  <br>  As for the discharge, if you've been getting it regularly since menstruation began it could be your body just figuring out how much lubrication it needs and it will back off after the hormones have stabilized a bit.

XhJL7tnwaa	1. Fixing the Moisture Problem: Mold cannot grow without moisture. <br>  Besides fixing such maintenance problems as leaky pipes, your best defense against mold growth is to control the humidity level within your home. Keeping your humidity level at 30-50% in the winter and less than 60% in the summer will help combat moisture problems. Adequately-sized heating and cooling ventilation systems, better air circulation, and the use of a dehumidifier can all help lower your home’s humidity.<br>  <br>  2. Drying of Wet Materials: Especially when overflow or flooding has occurred, drying of wet materials should begin immediately to stop mold growth. Fans and dehumidifiers can help in this process. You may need to discard the items if you cannot dry them well within 48 hours.<br>  <br>  3. Treatment or Disposal of Contaminated Materials: Before beginning mold treatment and clean up, you should consider using protective equipment. This equipment includes rubber gloves, eye goggles (preferably without vents), outer clothing that can be easily removed and/or discarded, and a filter dust mask. Some items that have been affected by mold can be saved, some cannot. Here is a list of items and possible treatments:<br>  Clothes: Mild mildew spots can often be treated by brushing off surface growth outside and then allowing the items to sun and air dry. For washable items, soap and water followed by sun and air-drying can be effective. Persistent mold may call for a stronger solution; severely damaged items should be thrown away. Porous Materials (Carpet, Wood Products, Ceiling Tiles, etc.): These items should typically be discarded, especially if mold is severe. Carpets can sometimes be saved with simple methods, such as sponging with dry soap or detergent suds and then wiping clean, or using a shampoo machine. Professional services may be necessary. For solid wood see section 4 below. Paper and Books: Although there is often no hope for these items, minor damage can often be rectified by brushing off surface mold and sprinkling with cornstarch or talcum powder to eliminate dampness.<br>  <br>  Discarded items should be enclosed in plastic bags or wrapped in plastic sheets to prevent more contamination.<br>  <br>  4. Cleaning of Surfaces: Non-porous materials such as hard plastic, concrete, glass, metal, and solid wood can usually be cleaned of mold. Scrub mold off with detergent and water and then dry completely.<br>  <br>  5. Disinfecting Surfaces: After cleaning hard surfaces, you may choose to disinfect them. Mixing 1/4 to 1/2 cup of bleach per gallon of water provides an effective disinfectant solution. Allow the solution to dry on the surface of the treated areas rather than wiping up. Open windows while doing this to prevent inhaling fumes. Also, remember to never mix bleach and ammonia—they can produce toxic gas.<br>  <br>  6. Closing the Door on Mold: Mold will take any opportunity to grow in your home. Stay alert for moisture problems, musty odors, and other signs that mold may be forming. Following mold prevention guidelines is the best safeguard against this uninvited and potentially harmful guest.|`|gzaXHcweaa	Because you are pregnant everything you take in the baby takes in. that really doesnt sound healty to me, if i were you sell your apt and find a new one.|`|5rsN7VsUaa	you need to get out now!!!! the new place should be water leak free. |`|W7LGoC3yaa	You need to talk to the apartment manager about this and demand that it be taken care of.

FgPZ8Sl8aa	Marijuana is a relatively safe substance.<br>  It causes ZERO deaths per year. <br>  It has never been linked to be a cause for cancer. <br>  It does NOT kill brain cells (in fact more recent studies show it can help spur new brain cell growth).<br>  Inhaling of smoke can be damaging to lungs, which is obvious, because inhaling burning plant material is simply not good for you. However, there is no reason to believe that second hand marijuana smoke puts you at any elevated risk. Being subjected to only the smell may be annoying to you, but it isn't at all dangerous.<br>  <br>  To me it sounds like you are overly concerned on this issue, I suggest you opt to take a smoke break with him and realize that most (if not all) that you thought you knew about marijuana is a lie.<br>  <br>  If you drink caffeine, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or take aspirin you are already subjecting yourself to more dangerous substances than marijuana.<br>  |`|2zGKZB6gaa	I wouldn't be concerned about my health as much as the fact that he has this illegal substance in your room which could you both in trouble if he's caught.

kgfFGl0paa	If your pills come in a 21-pill package, just get yourself one of those one-week pillkeeper boxes, keep it in the same place where your pills are, and open one compartment each day at the same time you would normally take your pill.

Cutting your wrists really hurts. And it barely gives you the attention you need right now. Think about it: What are you trying to do when you cut your wrists? "I wanna kill myself"?. If you wanted to kill yourself, youdve done it without asking Yahoo!Answers' approval. Act out in other ways. Like being helpful to your parents. Dressing like someone who will grow up and have a job and not depend on someone else because you can handle yourself and your problems.

S0CEAX0Naa	I dont think Its likely that they will do a hair strand test,this is an expensive option, and used more in specific situations, for specific reasons, and i dont believe that volunterng @ a hospital is cause for them to examine what illecit drugs you have used ever-in your life..They willl most likely go with urine or saliva, just to be sure that you dont currently abuse drugs,ect..Drink lots of water, im sure you will be fine...|`|9Ba5bC6Yaa	If your doing a urine test it can stay in your system 30 days or so depending on the amount of fat on your body. With a hair test they can check up to 120 days~but since you haven't smoked it much you should be ok~if you're freaked out I've heard that taking niacin can help but it makes you really red & itchy.|`|BcePsZ8Naa	If they do hair you will fail. It stays in the hair as long as you have the hair.<br>  Honestly I can not say what they would do. I guess it depends on how important the job is. It is unlikely they will test for all 4 and even more unlikely that they would test hair. If it is a volunteer position they may not want to spend the money and the Hair test can be expensive.|`|WZimr7kVaa	It STAYS in your hair until you cut it off. As for in your system, pot stays for up to 6 months. You're basically screwed, find a way out of it. There is nothing you can take to get it out of your system.<br>  <br>  Mouthwash isn't going to do anything, and the shampoo probably won't help either.|`|OPU2KqNxaa	Typically that's just a standard consent form so that should they choose to test you, they will already have your consent to do so. <br>  <br>  If you want to go with the detox shampoo to be safe, go for it. <br>  <br>  But for future reference stay away from pot!<br>  <br>  Its bad news bears :)|`|685nz3gUaa	They won't do all the tests.<br>  Probably just the urine test.<br>  <br>  Get the detox drink and chug it right before (it's a lot of liquid, but it's doable). <br>  <br>  The hair test works for the whole time you've had that hair...so if you shave your head then you'll pass that one lol |`|hwJeQnQPaa	Well if it's for a hospital job, I would'nt be surprised if they do teat all 4. They don't want anyone that could potentialy harm a patient.

With hospitals they are very strict regardless if  you are volunteering or not..and yes most hospitals will test all four..and you will fail big time.  Urine testing is  weak testing to pass for low security jobs, but hospitals are high security jobs due to the fact that drugs and medications are traffic threw there alot. You can waste your money if you want to on detox stuff but like I said it is a waste of money..your best bet is if you ever want to get a decent Job or volunteer work clean yourself up and make new friends..|`|HXPa0yYxaa	If they do a hair test, it will show up within the past 90 days....<br>  <br>  ...but keep in mind, this is usually for avid smokers, not once every few years sort of thing.  There's a 50-50 chance that they will find it.<br>  <br>  I have slid under a hair follicle test.  No amount of detox shampoo will help, nor will mouthwashes.  If they're going to do a hair test, there's a good chance it will show up.<br>  <br>  However, if they're simply going to do a urine, blood or saliva test, you have nothing to worry about, it only stays in your system for a week if you smoke occasionally, if you smoke daily, then upwards of a month.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Pot stays in your system 30 days. If it's a hair test, you could be in trouble. If it's urine, you'll need to wait to take the test till at least the 15th of Dec.|`|nNCtHNepaa	If they give you hair, then you'll test positive. It's much less likely with  urine, blood and saliva testing. Detox shampoo doesn't do anything, neither does mouthwash. Your best bet is to drink a lot a lot of water for the urine  and saliva test.

Contact your county/local mental health agency, and find out what help they can offer.  (U.S.A.) Try phoning 411, and Google: "clinics; mhmr; (your city); (your state)"<br>  <br>   In EMDR, a therapist will ask you to revisit a traumatic event and remember the feelings, negative thoughts, or memories associated with it. While you are doing this, the therapist will hold up two fingers about eighteen inches from your face and move them from side to side. You will be told to track the movement of the therapist’s fingers with your eyes. <br>  <br>  As you concentrate on the traumatic event during therapy, you are trying to bring its memory to life. The mental imagery you are able to conjure up during the therapy session is then processed, aided by your eye movements,(something like how Rapid Eye Movements happen during the dreams of sleeping people, when the subconscious mind expresses itself) facilitating the exchange of painful memories and helping to achieve resolution and a state involving less painful emotions.<br>  <br>  Professional EMDR is always much preferable, and Opester, (who gives it a glowing recommendation) a therapist with more than 20 years experience, and a former contributor, here, stated that it was one of only 2 disorders which can be completely cured.<br>  |`|IvoaNyN2aa	Google NLP Neuro Linguistic Programming..it helps<br>  <br>  Rescue remedy from health food store<br>  Accepting what happened and letting go<br>  <br>  When you are fearful let the fear wash over you and  passthru you..dont resist it..when you resist it persists<br>  <br>  Stay away from news reports, scary movies and things that can upset you....it gets better and time does heal|`|AA12278392	 I take many ,Many medications, I have been to counseling, Which did Me no good at all, I took it upon Myself to do a project in wood, Get Yourself a hobby, It helps to keep Your mind occupied on what is at hand.

00fSfCdFaa	You'll only be taken off the antidepressants when the psych feels you're ready. I suggest you dont take yourself off them  before this time as there's a chance you'll just slip straight back into depression. <br>  <br>  If you receive proper therapy, which helps you learn to address and deal with your emotions, and how to cope with any future crises that may occur, you should be well safe-guarded against becoming depressed again. By learning how to deal with this past situation involving your ex, you will be more equipped to deal with future situations. <br>  <br>  People become depressed when they are too swamped over with life events. This can last a really short time, a day or a week. Or, if the person doesnt change the way they deal with these situations, depression can last many years. <br>  <br>  Hopefully, when you've finished your treatment, you will be prepared to face anything that may come up against you in the future. These events will ALWAYS occur, to everyone, it's how you respond to them that determines whether you get depressed again. Depressed people tend to draw these crisis events into themselves, they blame things on themselves and become swamped with guilt, self-loathing, anger etc. They dont see things in a balanced way they see things in a "oh im usefless! why did I make that happen!!?" sort of way. It's about turning these events away from yourself and thinking about all the possible factors which may have played a part, which prove that you arent useless etc. <br>  <br>  All the best|`|E59mK1FUaa	Getting through the depression is about way more than pills. It's an illness that requires constant care. Anti-depressants can only do so much. A lot of it is figuring out what you need in your life, changing what you can change, and accepting what you can't.

A lot of people would have turned to drugs or alcohol, but you have a good job and take care of your boys to the very best of your ability. I admire you very much. Your mom has a big problem. I thought while I was reading that she'd apologized, come to terms with her treatment of you, felt bad at least. None of the above. She has hurt you time and time again. I know how much you must secretly dream of having a mom to love and care for you, but  I'm afraid she's never going to be it. Stick to your guns. Remind her of how she threw you and your kids out. Let her know that she has abused you long enough, but that you will not stand by and watch her abuse your children too. Tell your sisters to mind their own business. If they want her to stay with them, they should call her. Write all of this to her. I know it's hard to say the words....so write them. Just be tough, as you have been. You sound like such a good person, please don't let her hurt you again. She doesn't deserve you.

Fs0WUQtyaa	I would say that you need to attack the problem with several different methods.  It's like when you hurt your back, you see a chiropractor, you take advil, you ice it, you take warm baths, etc.  The same applys to depression.  You need to do several different things for optimal results.<br>  <br>  First, see a therapist.  Secondly, take meds like Zoloft or whatever your therapist or doctor deem appropriate.  Third, build a social network of people you can talk to when something is bugging you.  This could include your mom, best friend, or even sibling.  Forth, reduce your stress by lightening your workload, if possible.  Do what's absolutely critical, and let the other things go.  Fifth, exercise on a regualr basis.  Exercise brings up your serotonin levels and makes you feel happier and more positive.  And finally, don't sweat the small stuff.  Learn to differentiate between what's really important and what doesn't really matter.  Unless it's life or death, it probably doesn't matter as much as you think it does.|`|gSwobfujaa	i dont know what cbt is...could u post what that means? well anyways...everyone will experience sadness in their lives. people will go thru really big things and have really hard choices to make. a lot of times...people call that depression- when its really just sadness. but either way...it still sucks. so when i start feeling sad and trust me, i get really bad...i try my hardest to think rationally. the smallest things make me upset too. if someone says something to u that u were offended by...take time to think if their comment was actually meant to hurt u. be rational...they probably didnt mean to offend u. understand that the world isnt out to get u...and that ur being sensitive. if u feel the need to cry...its okay. but do not allow urself to sit and sulk in it. dont listen to sad music and think about every sad thing that ever happened to u. that will put urself in a gloomier spot that u do not need to be in. trust me, a lot of ppl do this. dont!!! i did some online research for myself...on anger and sadness. they are extremely closely related. please...do that. each of these awesome sites explain what causes anger, why it gets out of hand, why it turns into sadness or depression and they they give u tips on how to calm urself down and get back on track. i wish i had the links...but i think ull find some comfort in doing it urself. being proactive to help urself is an amazing feeling...so please do that. take care and good luck hun :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: thank u!|`|IvoaNyN2aa	have you heard of the rescue remedy..plus breathe ...watch how shallow you breathe..it produces anxiety...slow the breath|`|0VIEqPDfaa	When my depression kicks in, I paint, or write poetry.
