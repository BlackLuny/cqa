I live in a suburb of pittsburgh and I hang out at an awesome bar on the weekends. It's called Mulligan's Clubhouse Grille and it's located in Harmarville. You should check it out if you don't want to spend alot of money but still wanna have fun! If your lucky you might even get to see a steeler player.

2q1XI0j9aa	theres hardly ANY underground shelters in texas.    Texas has solid rock about 3 feet under the surface and makes for building underground shelters and basments very difficult.  Tornadoes are not a HUGE problem in DFW; it is at the bottom of tornado alley and we get only about 4 o 5 funnels that touch ground a year and only a few that cause extensive damage (nothing like you would see in the further north midwest). Its not really something you plan your life or living area around. I have always lived in a bottom apartment or known my first floor neighbors very well. Try to get a first floor apartment and if you can't get a first floor apt, make friends with your neighbors and should a storm come, ask if you can chill with them until it passes. should there be a tornado warning that threatens your area the best place (regardless of house or apartment) to go is a closet or bathroom along an inside wall. The bath tub I have been told is the safest. Grab a mattress and place it on top of you. Definitely stay away from outside walls, windows and mirrors. The main thing I would be worried about is hail, almost every storm that comes through brings hail (thunder storm season is from amrch to october) So I would probably look for an apartment with either a carport or garage.    Like I said though, it is probably something you will never encounter. I have lived in central DFW all my life, and have never been affected or had any damage done to a home due to a tornado. They have come with in 6 miles of my parents house and in the 26 years that they lived here have never seen a tornado. If you do encounter one, you will have plenty of time to prepare (unlike an earthquake, lol), as they typically come with thunder storms and hail, you will have a few hours advance and the news will say tornado watch/warning; a watch means a funnel cloud is apossible, a warning means funnel clouds have been spotted and the potential for touch down is greater. If you can afford a house I would buy one anyways instead of an apartment, it will still probably be less than what you are paying now for a mortage/ rent and you can sell it for a profit later in life.|`|6d920711f9f980a9e93a140db57c7709aa	No shelters, you just hope you don't get blown away. There are tornado survival tips you can find online.     Seriously, how worried were you about earthquakes in California? From my experience of living in both states people are more worried about what they don't know. Californians think tornadoes are scary and Texans think earthquakes are scary.|`|zWVIUadKaa	Yes at least the apartments I've stayed in|`|WrDGhduxaa	Once you are used to it  you don't pay much attention to tornadoes.  There are a few safety measures, but it is not a big deal.  A tornado is only dangerous if it hits you. Most are misses.  Very few people have storm cellars any more.
SC6YCYOvaa	Hey!    Planes are cheaper these days, but still a lot more than taking a bus or even a train, when you factor in the cost of getting to and from the airport, time spent in security, delayed flights, etc.    Trains are pretty cheap, but much more than a bus, BUT on a train you can get up, walk around, go to the cafe car and have a drink, use semi-clean bathrooms, etc. I really love the train. If you book well in advance and as a group, you can save a substantial amount of money.    With buses, yes there is Mega Bus, Bolt-Bus and the chinatown bus. The Chinatown buses are usually the cheapest ($15 each way from NYC to DC), but are usually a bit cramped and you can't walk around and stretch, plus the bus take a good deal longer than the train.    When I take the train between DC and NYC, it takes less than 3 hours, is a great, fun ride, and I feel relaxed when I get there. If you guys have some extra cash, I'd take this option, if not, try one fo the bus lines.    There is an article on this site which talks about buses, trains, etc. to and from NYC. You may want to check it out. It is under the "transportation to NYC" section.    http://www.CheapInTheCity.com    I hope this helps!  Good luck!|`|TmYYOrcdaa	Nothing is cheaper than $30.

Seal hunting was the mainstay of the Inuit people long before the country became known as Canada.|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Inuit and Beothuk (among others) were doing it for millenium    English, French, Spanish, ect did it during colonial times.

The Inuit have been there for a while.  I am sure the Vikings killed a few when they showed up.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	First nations have hunted seals for thousands of years.     Early settlers in the 15th and 16th century would hunt seals for food and oil mostly for personal use and some trade.     by the 19th century the seal hunt as it's known now really took off. Large schooners and later steam ships would go to the ice to hunt seals. Young men would sign on to sealing crews because you could make good money and because of the danger. It was dangerous particularly in the early days just before WWI there was a sealing tragedy that led to the deaths of many boys and men who were working the ice.     After thousands of years Harp seals still remain strong with 5 million off the coast of Newfoundland. Far from endangered pretty amazing considering how long they've been hunted, something must be going right.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Since before it was known as Canada.|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	Since we found killing cute little seals was fun,you should try it.
tV7ZYIeEaa	quick service dining at both parks. Usually serves burgers/fries, sandwich, pizza, chicken tenders/fries, pasta, salads. Price range $6-$9. Not including drink.    You can also bring your own sandwich and drinks inside the park.|`|iWwjNuj9aa	Really inexpensive meals in the theme parks are hard to find, but  here are some cheap options for real food that will fill you up. Prices below are approximate...     Magic Kingdom - Main Street Bake Shop is your best bet for a cheap breakfast: in addition to baked goods, mostly priced in the $2-$3 range, you can get breakfast quiche or cottage cheese and fruit for around $4. For lunch or dinner, Casey's Corner (Main Street) has a large hot dog with slaw or fries for under $6 and a side of chili for under $2. Get a bowl of clam chowder or vegetarian chili at Columbian Harbor House for under $5. Cosmic Ray's (Tomorrowland) has a half rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables (split it between two people) for around $9.     Epcot - For breakfast, there really aren't any great cheap options. Later in the day, Boulangerie Patisserie (France) sells ham and cheese croissants for $3.25, ham and cheese quiche for $5 or a fruit and cheese plate for $6. Lotus Blossom Cafe (China) has two egg rolls for $4 or pot stickers for $5. Yakitori House offers teriyaki chicken for $6. Or walk out the International Gateway to the Spoodles Pizza window, where a slice is about $4.    Disney's Hollywood Studios - Starring Rolls Bakery has lots of inexpensive ($1-$2) mini baked goods for breakfast, or for something more substantial, a bagel with smoked salmon for $6. Rosie's All American Cafe offers a soup of the day for under $3. Toy Story Pizza Planet offers a substantial salad with feta cheese and olives for $5 and a couple of pizza options under $6.    Animal Kingdom - For a light breakfast, your best bet is Kusafiri Coffee Shop and Bakery next to Tusker House, where you can get a muffin or sweet roll for $2-$4. Anandupur Local Food Cafes has egg rolls or fried rice for under $4. Get a fruit and cheese plate at Harambe Fruit Market for under $6. Pizzafari offers a basket of cheesy bread sticks with marinara sauce for $4.    Some of the best food can be found outside the theme parks, at the resort hotels.    Here's a cheap (and healthy!) alternative - Fresh Fruit!    Each park has at least one fruit stand. Apples, pears, bananas, and oranges are usually around $1, which is very inexpensive compared with other snacks at the parks. Some stands also sell baby carrots for around $1. At the larger stands you may find watermelon or cantaloupe slices, grapes, strawberries, cut-up pineapple, yogurt, fruit salad, corn on the cob or baked potatoes at varying prices, with nothing over $4.    There are three fruit stands in the Magic Kingdom: on Main Street, at Liberty Square Market and in Mickey's Toontown Fair. Disney's Hollywood Studios has Anaheim Produce on Sunset Blvd. At Epcot, fruit is available at the Refreshment Outpost between China and Germany in World Showcase. Animal Kingdom offers fruit at Harambe Market in Africa, just outside Kilimanjaro Safaris.     Here's another cheap alternative for meals; Disney used to have a policy "requesting" that guests did not bring outside food and drink.     Now it has changed its policy! Guests are allowed to bring food items, such as snacks or foods that do not require heating, into any Walt Disney World theme park. It is also completely fine to bring in bottled water or soft drinks.     One note of caution: avoid bringing in anything highly perishable, such as cold cuts. It would be easy to end up with food poisoning!    Also, you absolutely will NOT be allowed to bring in the following: hard-sided coolers, large coolers, glass containers, or alcoholic beverages. Also, you cannot bring any type of straws (even the little ones attached to juice boxes) into Animal Kingdom.    There are many other great ways to save lots at Disney.     Go to   http://tinyurl.com/disneysavings    ...this site's info comes direct from an ex Disney employee. She shows you how to save $200 on your park tickets alone and $1,000's on your Disney holiday costs. And she's just put out a really useful Disney Savings Guide for 2009.    Enjoy!|`|VVSqTdaOaa	Cheap food at the parks are less than $10.00.

z4Yrn96Paa	23% live in Siberia, yet Siberia constitutes 75% of Russia's land mass.  That tells us that life if hard out in those cold areas and most Russians have found life, and jobs, better in the larger cities located on the European side of Russia.  Russia's third largest city however is the capital of Siberia, Novosibirsk. In fact 5 or the 10 largest cities in Russia are located in Siberia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:La... That shows how even more concentrated are the two capitals, Moscow and St Petersburg.

There are several larger cities in Siberia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekaterinbur...|`|P0fcmrkSaa	Coz there're very few cities in Siberia.    Russia began to develop from the west. Many years ego the Russian lived only in Europe. And there a lot of Russian cities, towns and villages were built. Then we go to the East...to Siberia. And some Russians settled there too. But the climate there is colder, there were built some lonely cities... Nobody wanted to live there... It's so far away from another cities....from Europe... what to do there?    When we founded minerals in the Urals we built many factories there... And then many citis webe built on that places.    And in Siberia? It's economicly unprofitable to live there, build roads. The most cities of that region are near the trans siberian railrway and near seas or frontier...  Would you like to live in a region where there isn't roads? And where there isn't another cities in many many miles? And it's also they need to eat something, to have some goods... It is sooooo far away to bring it there... It's better to live in west where many people already live.   And in Russia almost there isn't so many people to occupy all the country. When we won't have enough space to live (like in China) we'll go to Siberia :D|`|EMYImof1aa	it's ******* cold and rural|`|cdb58ec09082c219d5a820928a9f856aaa	It is mainly a giant cold forest...hard to grow crops and build cities there.

YQfmBvHPaa	That's, right, Barcelona shouldn't be considered north-Spain but eastern-Spain. Saint Johns festival isn't held in Barcelona, but in Valencia and Alicante.    In Barcelona they celebrate the day of Saint George (Sant Jordi in Catalan).    And Carnival is more a festival from Southern Spain, specially Cadiz and Canary Islands. The same with Semana Santa, which is not very popular in northern-Spain or Catalonia, it's much popular in Castilla and Leon (specially Zamora), and Andalucia (specially Sevilla).    The most famous festival in north Spain are the "encierros" (men running down the streets being followed by bulls) in the city of Pamplona (Navarra), or the Santiago's day in Santiago de Compostela (Galicia).|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Barcelona is NOT Northern Spain...it is Eastern Spain...Northern Spain would be, like the Basque Country (almost any place to eat is good!) and Oviedo, Santander, Santiago de Compostela.      Good restaurants in Barcelona?  hmmm.  I ate at a wonderful place in Port Vell...too bad I never got the name of it!  REALLY good seafood!!!    It's great to eat just at the Boqueria market...You can either buy fresh stuff like fruits and veggies, sausages and hams, bread, etc., and go out to the Ramblas to eat, or there are many little caf type places where you belly right up to the bar, and order.     Good hotels?  In Barcelona?  I stayed in an apartment I wouldn't recommend.  Not terribly happy.     Festivals?  The only one I can remember (in Barcelona) is St. John's day, (June 24), but they must have a Fair, surely the Carnaval week is as big a deal there as in many other places, Semana Santa?  and The patron saints' days...Sta. Eulalia, and St. George.  Not sure how they spell it in Cataln.

AA11496012	See if Air Tran or Spirit flies into Detroit as well as Northwest Airlines and Southwest Airlines.

The big travel websites are some of the best to be honest.  Like someone else said, I would say that orbitz and possibly travelocity (gotta love the gnome) are probably the best.  They really do negotiate with the airlines to get cheaper fares and it really works in your favor because the fares are usually cheaper than you could find on your own.

AA10921359	First of all, i-695 is pretty self-explanatory.  The i stands for interstate, so it is a fairly major highway.  Most major highways have signed exits, so in that example, as you proceed north, you will also see 3 and/or 3a.  Just keep going until you get to 3b, and then exit the highway.  In the event that the numbers get smaller as you go north, then they would go like maybe 5 and then 4 (with or without letters), so just be ready for 3b (in other words, get into, or stay in, the right lane).  Re GPS, yes it will make it easy for you, and it will also display the appropriate exit number(s).

c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	Nobody really knows where that cheese really was invented; some say in France, in a city called "Romadour" or "Romand-dure", in Normandy. The Normands, however, say, that cheese was thrown into their cities by Roman catapults to test their endurance (therefore, the "Roman dure"), and the Hessians simply call it "Handk?s mit Musik" ("common cheese with a sound"), whereas the Bavarians (such as I am) are more direkt and call it "Stinkk?s" ("stinking cheese") -- On supermarket shelves, however, "Limburger" is the common name..|`|70169fb4925a4cff614639692b3cd20baa	I smiled a little about the way you spelled it.

pcHp7Dgkaa	The requirements vary from state to state. In all cases, as you are moving here permanently, you will need to get an Australian licence within 3 months and in most states, you will need to pass a written test of the road rules. I don't think that any state will require you to also do a driving test.    This government site has links to licensing information for all states and territories.  http://www.immi.gov.au/living-in-austral...|`|Lt8UFEIoaa	Im pretty sure you will have to sit a test. My partner did when he moved here from Pakistan.|`|dbs4O0ySaa	Yes, your license will be transferable to an Australian license. It depends on which state you are moving to, since there are different laws for each state.     If you are moving to NSW, you will be exempt from taking the knowledge and practical exam, and you can get a NSW license outright when you visit the local Road Transport Authority.     For more information, you can head to:  http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/|`|fOCRHaxGaa	If you are a driver or motorcyclist who has moved to NSW - either from another Australian State or Territory, or from another country - you will need to make arrangements to get a NSW driver or rider licence.    You can use your existing licence for up to three months, after which you must have a NSW licence in order to drive a vehicle or ride a motorcycle.    This section tells you how to get a NSW licence. Please note that the process is different for interstate and international drivers.|`|zYkf4J49aa	Canadian Driving Licence holders are treated the same as UK Driving Licence holders, in Australia.    We are both on the list of approved countries, where the following applies:    A UK full licence holder is able to "swap" their UK licence for an Australian one, without the need for ANY tests, Theory or Practical.    This has been an area of confusion for some years, as different States had different rules for this over the years, but this is something that has now been standardised for all States. The licence costs are different for each State though.    You do still retain your old UK licence, as it is not actually cancelled or retained by most States.    This only applies to Private vehicles, NOT commercial vehicles.
ODedx7t4aa	Generally, there are some patterns to conjugation and the endings are pretty much the same, with the exception of a few.  The verb groups I have been able to identify are those that end the following ways:    owa?/iwa? = uj?, ujesz    awa? = aj?, ajesz    a? = am, asz    i?/e? = ?, esz    take pracowa? for example, which means "to work"    pracowa? = to work    I (Ja) Pracuj?    You (Ty) Pracujesz    He/She (On/Ona) Pracuje    We (My) Pracujemy    You (plural) Pracujecie    They Pracuj?

2yOxIYLkaa	The origin of kebab may lie in the short supply of cooking fuel in the Near East, which made the cooking of large foods difficult, while urban economies made it easy to obtain small cuts of meat at a butcher's shop.The phrase is essentially Turkish in origin and Turkish tradition has it that the dish was invented by medieval Turkic soldiers who used their swords to grill meat over open-field fires|`|dIjLmMYFaa	The word "kebab" is of Arabic origin, but the word "shish" (?i? - in Turkish) is of Turkish.   The phrase explains it well, Shish Kebab is a form of Kebab found by Turkish people.    "Kebab (also transliterated as kebap, kabab, kebob, kabob, kibob, kebhav, kephav) refers to a variety of meat dishes in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, African, Central Asian, and South Asian cuisines, consisting of grilled or broiled meats on a skewer or stick."|`|oaaGhPnVaa	yup|`|MATiTs5Oaa	Shish Kebab:  A dish consisting of pieces of seasoned meat and sometimes vegetables roasted on skewers and served with condiments.    The following is its etymology.    [Armenian shish kabab, from Turkish ?i? kebab? : ?i?, skewer + kebab?, qualifying (possessive) form of kebap, roasted meat (probably from Arabic kabb, cooked meat in small pieces, possibly from Aramaic kabbb, burning, charring, from kabbeb, to char, roast, probably from Akkadian kabbu, to burn).        In Turkish, the Phonetics is somewhat like word is siskebabiu, where sis is a skewer or spit and kebap is roast meat. In Armenian, it's shish kabab, a little closer to English  pronunciation. Apparently the word and the food originated long ago in Turkey and long ago became an Armenian favorite as well. The English-language version could well have come from Armenia along with the many Armenian immigrants to the English-speaking world in the twentieth century.

NNEn2sh3aa	El Salvador has a somewhat bad reputation, mostly because of civil wars there in the 1980s. Now, the country is beloved by surfers and backpackers, and so long as you remain aware and vigilant, and stick close to your group, you should be fine - in that sense, it's like traveling to any other country. There are no ongoing wars, but there is a high crime rate, but it sounds as if you'll be in a rather safe situation inside schools. You should check out this Wiki guide (it has a section on safety)  http://wikitravel.org/en/El_Salvador  and also consult the US Dept. of State Travel page for safety alerts and more detailed safety information:   http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw...|`|05Bdlyreaa	Hi Erin!

You should have no problems with safety.  I have been going to El Salvador since 2001.  Five of those years with a faith based relief group.  Have driven many, many miles all over the country and never had a problem. Churches are not going to put you in areas with a potential for danger.   For the most part the people of El Salvador are some of the kindest, most generous people you will ever meet.  You may be surprised to learn that there are several sate of the art malls in El Salvador.  It is true that there are areas that are not safe but really don't think you will be going there.  As long as you dress appropriately and don't wear a ton of jewelry and leave your expensive toys at home you will be fine. How  can you get in touch with the local culture if you got your Ipod blasting away?  Do bring a decent pocket camera and memory cards to take lots of photos of your adventures. You can get cds burned and prints made at photo kiosks in the malls cheap.  I remember one person brought a polaroid camera and a bunch  of film and took instant photos people and gave it to that person, was a big hit.  Bring lots of candy for the kids or buy it there to hand out Tootsie rolls always seem to be popular and don't melt.    For your personal safety and comfort  Don't walk around alone.  Don't travel at night if possible.  Hydrate! drink lots of water! I can't telll you how many people get sick from lack of water. It's cheap.  If you get diahrea  lets someone in charge know so you can get help it, isn't funny and I know of a few cases where kids got really sick.  Remember their gut bugs are different than yours.  Don't eat the fruit from a street vendor without washing first.  Anything cooked should be ok.  Take sun blocker and sun glasses.  Benadryl and an epi pen if you are alleric to bug bites/stings.  Remember that the availability of medical care isn't what it is in the U.S.  Take toilet paper with you when you travel lots of restrooms don't have any.  I have been in charge of more groups of people than I can remember and other than a bus or two breaking down or somebody running off on their own, never had a serious problem.  Prepaid phones are super cheap there like $12.00 and you can get them at the malls and larger grocery store and minutes to call the U.S. are cheap.    Do try pupusas, pollo compero,ice cream from Pops,paletas,  tres leches, flan, pan con gallina, elote.    So relax and enjoy have a great time.  Hope you fall in love with the country like I did.|`|qOzEuQofaa	I suggest you don't wear any jewelry that looks flashy/expensive. Stick with your group and you will be ok. As long as you don't look like a gang member you are good, specially being a girl you won't have a problem there. I've gone there many times and i'm still alive so that says it all. Just make sure you buy water don't drink any of the tap 'cuz you will get the runs. Have fun and enjoy it for me.

m1JxtSVSaa	i will let them talk.. i don't care what people say about me or think about me because i know it's not true.. and if the people who are close to you will believe him then they are not true friends.. because if they are they won't listen to him  and it happened to me many times and sadly most of the time people will trust him not me.. but if you know it's not true then you shouldn't care..  bass of course you can still defend yourself.. but if the person will continue telling lies about you, you can ignore him.. i think it's the best way|`|oThKwCw4aa	lol....my brother does that to me all the time...  he is always like "do you remember when you were in 8th grade you used to take my stuff away..."  or " you remember when we were kids you told me to say this and that and I thought you were always right and did all the things"  but I have never done such things to him... I think he really likes to make me look like a mean heartless older sister who bossed him around...:D  and he always repeats these stories infront of anyone we know!!!|`|ie5AKYToaa	I'd defend myself but in a civilized manner, without yelling or insulting the person, that way, I end up better than them in the end.    However, if they are the ignorant type and don't even bother to listen to what I have to say, then I would just tell them my final word or opinion about that subject, then tell them that they are stubborn and full of ignorance. If a person is not willing to change their mind, then don't waste any time trying to change it for them, it's their loss anyways.     People who will spread lies about you only love it more when they see you become upset or angry about it, so if you make a big scene out of it, then you are probably allowing them to enjoy spreading lies. So try to ignore it, soon the other person will realize that it's not doing much. Meanwhile, if anyone else seems to believe those lies, just clear it up for them and tell them the truth.     People are always going to find a reason to hate you, and if they can't find one, they'll make one up. It's stupid, but you just have to find a way to deal with it b/c that's part of life.    EDIT: Well in that case, then I would go find the person and confront him and tell him what I think. If i can't find him, then I would just tell the people who are close to me my side of the story just so that they don't get the wrong idea.|`|zWKqEa9vaa	yeah that is bad but you know what?people who do this to you are the people who feel less than you,they won't say it or show it but that is how they feel.Be better then them and let it go.you know who you are and the people close to you should know who you are and what you do and don't do.So if you really care about these people explain to them once only and than let it go.The more you defend yourself,the less believable you will be.Don't bother talking to the person making those awfull claims.after all,there an old proverb that say:Fatishni bt kabirni.which means if you ask that horrible person why,you are actually giving him/her more attention than they actually deserve.|`|0j89XAmhaa	I agree with Kate.   learn to be patient, life has taught me that the truth always comes out at the end and you need to emerge spotlessly clean in it.    talking to him is petty and will bring you down to his level.  any friends you will lose over this, are those who jumped too quick to believe him without giving you the benefit of a doubt: you don't want such friends in your life anyway.|`|h6NUE6VTaa	definitely defend my self,ignoring them will make things even worse.i for one will not allowed anyone to trash me for what ever reason,believe me i'll get bitchy and violante if i have too,you should do the same and if you don't interact with that person you should call him,insult him...do whatever it take so he get the message and stop,you should also make your friend back you up and every time he talk bad about you they should stop him and defend you.|`|TPCFxRqQaa	sounds familiar, i have had this happen several times    hit them in the face, violence is the only way to solve anything|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	Your best friends know you for who you are.

496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	You are right people who don't even know you can come up with the most amazing detailed bullsh*t ~ to use a good Aussie term~ regarding your personal life and to be honest I could almost write a book about the things Ive had said about me and my life by people here in the Egypt category let alone in the real world.  Do I give a horses do-dang about people I don't know and don't know me, think or say about me.......no not anymore.   But I will admit that at first it used to hurt and sometimes I didn't know who was trying to hurt me. Was it those who were spraying the bullsh*t or those who claimed to be telling me so and so "only because they were my friend" or "because they respected me".  Angelo,sometimes you have to realise there is only one letter between the word friend and fiend, its sad but its true.  You are right in thinking that in most instances spite and jealousy is their motivation......so can you imagine how empty their dirty, pathetic little lives must be if they have to indulge in what is one of the basest forms of human behaviour to feel important.  Maybe if you remember two things it may help.....time reveals all and empty vessels make the most noise.  From my life experience and I admit I have had a pretty diverse life.. I have yet to meet someone who was totally above reproach.   Its the people who claim to be,"oh so nice" and "oh so clean" who are  the ones who turn their knickers inside out to make them last an extra day without washing them.  If this guy really is your friend then he knows the real you and knows what you would do,say etc. So its just a case where you have to have faith in yourself...... the courage of your convictions and trust in your friend that he can see through the bullsh*t and knows the difference between a friend and a fiend.  Its all to do with where you put your R's.    Ask Damian....... bet he will tell you the same thing!|`|0pM85b5Baa	I know it's very bad feeling, but don't worry it doesn't ruin your reputation or at least among people who can realize these things. If some people believed easily, that means they are that kind of people you may not need in your life. The normal this last kind are the majority.     It's good to ignore whatever is said and give no reaction just till it comes to you and someone discuss it with you or ask you directly. Sometimes people just want to put you in situation of reaction always, so don't give them that chance please. It's enough that you know {you should know details as possible} and you should what you will say and keep it till someone asks you.     Also sometimes when you leave it and watch it, that makes burn with their hate or internal flame. At that time you'll know if there is a real aim or it just came by chance. Watch it like a movies and you are the star.|`|ravzJTVOaa	such people are full of spite .  they are many , and full of imagination.  if i hear what they say , i defend myself without being angry or loud .  i speak to those whom i care for , not go about shouting my self defence .  yes, al fetna ashad men al qatl, but i wont correct the world .  im very broad minded abt it , and i dont lose my nerve .  i tell myself that my reputation is my best defence .|`|5Zi1uaEYaa	look yes there is ppl i know i just face like this situation every day but let me tell u if u still want this ppl in your life so blame them if u don't then let them say whatever they want i think ppl who truly know you will not believe all that **** so dont pay attention soon they will get bored of you and take another one to play the silly game again|`|hhhk499qaa	those people just wanna ruin you life. you have to ways to deal with this:  1-show them the opposite of what they think of you OR show them the opposite of what you think is the reason for them doing this    2-try to avoid these people    i know how you feel. my parents never trusted me. and they always create stories and lie and say that i did things which i actually didn't  and also i had a classmate in grade 6&7, there was a guy who was jealous of me, so he started being mean to me. so then to let him stop this, i did number 1 of the two shown above. it took time but then it worked    good luck!|`|e4ba687fef0f0cf91aee345fda8cb98caa	i have subjected to this situation from months ago and it is still continuing , what i have done and still doing is ignoring these people and don't strike back, all of people know me and if they have a doubt that i m bad person so they have end the relationship with me|`|oKE6EyJXaa	5ena2a !!|`|hiKtjrWNaa	u seem pissed off.. ok, if u r in a situation of defending ur self,do it without making big scene..  or simply ignore them  ?????? ???? ???????? ????    and the kafela must keep moving...

496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	Personally I prefer to be an independant traveller and made my first trip to Egypt alone. You will not only meet people in your hotel~ ,breakfast is always a good time,especially at hotels frequented by young or young spirited travellers.  I would advise you to get yourself a copy of The Lonely Planet Guide to Egypt and you will be fine. the " L.P.Guide is actullay much more than just a listing of places to go and things to do,the cost and service ratings it will serve you better than an actual guide in many instances.  I can recommend Pharaohs hotel in Dokki,its a really friendly and clean hotel and the rooms have A/C,TV,ensuite bathrooms at a very reasonalbe rate. Its also just a short walk over the Nile to the Downtown distict where you will find some great eating places as well as the usual MacDonalds,Kentucky and the Cairo Museum and also close to Metro stations,if you choose to use Cairo's public transport rather than paying for taxis to get you to places of interest.   It is a shame more travellers dont take advantage of the Metro which is clean,fast and goes to all areas of Cairo.   I would not suggest you use it to go to Giza as you'll end up having to also take a couple of buses and then quite a walk to the entrance of the complex,   To get to Giza and Saqarra you can hire a car for the morning through your hotel at around 100LE~ no more!  Its up to you whether you choose to fly to Luxor or take "the sleeping train"~cute name hey,but that is what it is referred to and is also a good place to meet up with other travellers. You do need to book and pay for your ticket 24 hours before departure and they will only accept payment in $US unless you get an Egyptian national to get the ticket for you.  To come to Egypt and not see Luxor where 75% of Egypts ancient monuments are is denying yourself a great experience.    Luxor is a very different city to Cairo and the west bank in particular transports you to another world.  There is so much to see and experience that most people find they have to end up having make a choice unless you are able to stay for a few weeks. Ive been living here for just on 3 years and coming in and out of Egypt for nearly 8years and there are still many places on my "must get to see list".   As far as nightlife, Cairo and Luxor both have some great licensed clubs with DJs or live music that are open all night during the summer season and until around 3-4am the rest of the year.  During the summer months Egypt seems to never sleep.  I promise you wont feel odd or out of place turning up at any of these places alone,as Egyptian are among the most friendly people I have ever met.   Whereever you go you will be made welcome and you will likely make friendships that will continue long after you go home.   You always have the option of joining 1,2 or 3 or 4 day tours and enjoying the laid back luxury of a Nile cruise.   As I said get yourself a copy of the Lonely Planet Guide and check out all the recomendations and alternatives...making the choice of what to fit in will be the hardest part of the trip.  Ahlan wa Salam Misr ~Welcome to Egypt.|`|ravzJTVOaa	you wont feel lonely in Egypt , bec it is full of fun.  decide where you would like to go and i will tell you what to see .  welcome to Egypt .|`|BAmNCDXUaa	Depends on how Old you are??  from where you coming??  wut r u intrested to do??  depends even if u r female or male!!  if u female then i know alot of egyptiane will race to know you and date you and g out with you everywhere!!!  but male u will be  Alone  but thats not matter  i have been travel many times very alone and i Discover soe cities while i was alone, and i get new friends in that trip!!|`|0pM85b5Baa	Sometimes to be alone is better.

Well if your staying in a hotel you could always make a few buddies there! Or book a coach/bus to take you sightseeing somewhere, you will always meet new people! Everyones friendly.  Where abouts in Egypt are you going? If you will go to Cairo, of course go see the Pyramids Sphinx etc, Also the big markets and just generally walk around taking in all the sights.   If its somewhere like Sharm el Sheikh then its very touristy there so you would easily meet many other tourists and become friends with them. Have fun!

UofhMpy9aa	I dont think so.  The concept of unjust enrichment portrays itself as the 'conscience' of the labor laws. I'd say both are amongst crucial elements of social justice, and that they complement each other.. in a way that 'unjust enrichment' bridges the gaps that might have been overlooked by established labor laws.     Laws arent supposed to be mere 'cold' legislations, that is why society conceives axioms that aims on humanization of laws, making macro principles adaptable to the greatly varying micro needs of individuals/elements of society.
YRGlM0J1aa	without professing to understand how social justice principles relate closely to labour law... i can only think no. they seem to support each other & should logically run in tandem. or it seems.    elaborate more, it sounds interesting :)|`|PQb9MU4gaa	I don't really understand your question but so far as i am concern Social Justice is Civil Justice.

It is great for tourists because it is a shallow city. It is the equivalent of Disney land for adults. Once you live here you see the problems of ridiculously expensive housing, bad neighborhoods and rood people.  I recently went to NYC and was shocked at how nice everyone was! This is NY, compared to Miami they were white Knights.     I moved to Miami with the very same attitude, and I am planing my escape as soon as I can.

QUPSol2uaa	All cities here in Australia have their pros & cons. Brisbane (Queensland) seems to be you best match to your specifics. Sydney (New South Wales) is also up there but rental accommodation is very competitive & expensive. Melbourne (Victoria) & Adelaide (South Australia) have very cold & wet winters. Perth (Western Australia) is not bad either but be mindful it is very isolated from the other states.     My suggestion is get over here and start at a point, get the feel and then decide where you wish to settle permanently......best suggestion stick to the east coast Queensland/New South Wales/Victoria as it is the cheapest & easiest to investigate|`|Lt8UFEIoaa	Investigate the Gold Coast. Its a city of 500,000+, major tourism area, lots of beaches, mountains. Tourism is the major industry so there is work, and a fair bit of construction going on, several new high rises being built in Surfers Paradise.   Weather is warm and sometimes humid in the summer, and the winters aren't too bad, it rarely drops below 10.c at night.  Public transport is ok, surfside buslines run pretty regularly, and there is trains that take u up to brisbane if u need to go up there.   Check out realestate.com.au for available rentals, u should be able to get a 2 bed unit for around $300/wk.
VDbbTUnAaa	Airlines have different bases at hubs and other strategic cities throughout their route system.  Many airlines don't have restrictions as to where you live, but it's your responsibility to get to the city where you start a trip.  Say you live in Vienna and work for Air France, and you're working a flight Paris-Atlanta.  You will need to commute on your own to Paris to pick up your trip.  Air France will not fly you to Paris.  You will be able to non-rev or jumpseat from VIE-CDG, but you won't be what's called "positive space."|`|37U0P66naa	in the same place you have been living. if your a pilot sometimes you have to stay where you end up. the next day you would probably be flying a plane that goes to your hometown. sometimes you fly to a city and back to your hometown. you might do that roundtrip twice in a day to the same city or two roundtrips two two different cities depending on the length of the flights. sometimes you go to one or two cities then back to your hometown on the same day. the airline will schedule you to fly places and back home as fast as possible. the airline knows you need to go back home.|`|xZ02tIicaa	um... in a house your house because affter the flight doesnt the plane fly back?|`|wR0U1Lqraa	I have always wondered that my self. What i do know is this:  -commercial pilots get paid big bucks, so where ever you do live, it should be nice.  -Pilots are only allowed to spend 100 hours on a plane every month. This includes time spent on the tarmac.

When you are in any place, you always need to be cautious and avoid taking unnecessary risks.  But so long as you are reasonably aware of your surroudings, you should have no issue travelling in Puerto Rico.

They are served by the Heathrow Express (expensive) train from Paddington station, and the slightly slower but a bit cheaper Heathrow Connect, also from Paddington.    The nearest station you can use which you don't have to pay premium fares for (to cover the cost of building the tunnels into Heathrow) is Hayes & Harlington on the Paddington to Reading line - if you get off there, you can catch the frequent 140 bus route from the stop right outside the stations, to the airport's central bus station.

3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	The music for Hotel California probably comes from the song "We Used To Know" - by Jethro Tull.  The Eagles toured with Jethro Tull just before they came out with their song.  See:    http://youtube.com/watch?v=EgO7MamJnqM    The song is credited as being written by Don Felder, Don Henley and Glenn Frey.  It was released in 1976 by the Eagles.    There are many fantastic ideas about the meaning of the lyrics of the song.  These theories usually pick one or two isolated items from the entire song.  Almost all songs tell a story, and as such all of the lyrics should contribute to the whole.  Hotel California is no different.    The meaning of the lyrics are that the song is a description of the journey from Need to Love and Marriage to Divorce and ultimately to the impossibility of regaining the life and happiness of the pre-divorce state.     Initially the traveler is feeling the need of a relationship My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night.  The traveler meets his love and gets married There she stood in the doorway.  I heard the mission bell.  A marriage commitment opens up the possibility of happiness but, also, the traveler is aware that he is vulnerable to the possibility of intense unhappiness.  And I was thinking to myself, this could be heaven or this could be hell.    Unfortunately the marriage dissolves and his former love becomes obsessed with money Her mind is Tiffany-twisted where Tiffany refers to the very expensive New York Store, Tiffany & Co..  With the divorce there is the division of property- she got the Mercedes Benz.  After the breakup when he sees her with any guys she reassures him that the pretty, pretty boys are just friends.  In this new world of being single the other singles he meets do their dance in the courtyard. of life.  They generally fall into one or the other of two groups.  There are those who cant stop talking about their Ex. Some dance to remember and there are those who dont want to say anything at all about their past marriage some dance to forget.      Now in this world of being divorced he longs to return the pre-divorced state of happiness So I called up the captain, please bring me my wine but he finds that his happiness (wine) is now irrevocably in the past we havent had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine.     Deep into the post-divorce singles scene with mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice he is reminded that it is his actions that got him into the prison of being divorced, we are all just prisoners here, of our own device.  And, yet, he and others want this divorce nightmare to be over, so- they stab it with their steely knives, but they cant become pre-divorced, they just cant kill the beast.  Now frustrated he panics and is, running for the door.  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before.  But he is brought up short when the night man informs him that You can checkout any time you like, (commit suicide) but you can never leave (become pre-divorced).    There are two choruses in the song and each mention the Hotel California.  This reference is to the environment in California around the time the song was written.  California was experiencing the highest divorce rate in the nation.   Each chorus has lines that remember his past marriage such a lovely place and his past lover such a lovely face.  The first chorus indicates that there can always be more divorces Plenty of room at the Hotel California, any time of year, you can find it here.  The second chorus points out that, as a part of divorce, you will always bring your alibis    For a really good rendition see:    http://youtube.com/watch?v=HAM1g0oX4OE|`|TdE0J2xVaa	Hotel California is a euphemism for the whole state of California.

KS2OHXCRaa	To keep on wearing the contacts without giving your eyes a rest is even more straining and tiring. I can't see how it'll be better to keep on wearing the contacts in order not to strain your eyes.    If you want to retain clear vision while you're at the airport etc while you walk around, buy a travel contact lens solution and case, and as soon as you get on your flights, take the contacts off. The close your eyes and let them rest a little.
s34GP3Ioaa	Assessors are employee's of the county.  What you are in need of is a state certified real estate appraiser.  You're looking at a fee of anywhere from $300.00 and up.  First of all you have to prove that the price that you paid for the condo has decreased in value since you bought it.  If they are close to what you paid for it forget trying to reduce your tax bill.  Either ask your new neighbors what they paid for them or ask the management what your model is selling for either new or resale.  Otherwise go to the county records and find out what current sales are for comparable properties in your neighborhood.  You could also contact a realtor in your neighborhood and tell them that you are thinking of selling and get an estimate of value on your property which the county will not recognize but will inspire you to go through all the necessary channels to reduce your taxes.

From Cagayan when you are in the city. You could shoulder all the expenses going to benoni wharf. This includes a jeepney fare of P13.00 /rt going to agora where you ride a bus to balingoan terminal for  about P300/RT then a ferry to benoni port for P260/RT. So thats about P600.00(rounded off  to hundredth) RT per person.(This does not include the camiguin tour-it only takes you there in benoni camiguin  and back)    Then from benoni, camiguin you can hire a van or a multicab(all good for 12 pax). They can take you around the island in 1 day for about P1500-P1800 for multicab & 2.5k-P3000 for van). It will be good if you have company , and the more you are the less you pay coz your splitting up the cost of transport. Entrances fees are minimal lets say P150.00/each.     The transport will take you back to the benoni port or  to the hotel where you wish to stay overnight. Then negotiate with  the driver to the time & cost of picking you up the next day to bring you to the port to go back to Cagayan.    Here's my no. 09072869860 maybe i can arrange the transport from Camiguin.|`|3e8a39c6c9f9b1330670c4d466725f66aa	its really an inexpensive tour to go there but you need to have your own transportation like motorcycle or anything after you get off the barge.|`|a2urP1FEaa	As somebody thats been an eight time visitor to Camiguin, this is something you could follow. In the past, i've usually approached a van driver upon arriving at the port in Benoni. If you ask the driver, he will be willing to take you around for a tour of Camiguin and also hook you up with a hotel within your price range. I've had the same driver (JoJo) for the past few trips in Camiguin, i paid P3400 for a full two days hire, even when we had two late nights up at Ardent Hot Springs, and also included picking up from the hotel going back to the port on the day of my departure. It might be a little more since my last trip was in November 2007.

vOpeZDnMaa	it totally depends on where you are departing from.  if you post the airport you will be leaving from, then you will probably yield better results here.  but if you do not with to do this, here is a simple step process to find cheapest fare:    -go to www.orbitz.com  -put in the dates you wish to travel and choose plus or minus three days to get a matrix  -once you find which air carrier is cheapest, go directly to their website for even cheaper fares...like orbitz is usually 6 or 7 dollars more than the american airlines website because they need to make a profit too  -depends on which airport in new york you wish to fly.  usually newark is the cheapest, although that it is newark, new jersey and would require travel into the city.  usually la guardia is then cheaper than JFK because JFK has many international flights coming in and going out  -you may also go to farecompare.com and click on april to see which days are generally cheaper    just a tip to follow, buy from the air carrier's website.  I am also going to new york city in april, so I hope your travels are good!|`|mX27tszPaa	I would say that your best bet is to stay online and away from travel agents because they will add on fees quick in my opinion.

0pM85b5Baa	I can't imagine what people miss when they don't visit Egypt, it's beyond words.     To enjoy Egypt, don't expect you will visit a modern city with a lot of technology.

Yes there are some dirty places specially in Cairo, but still doesn't affect that charm.     To avoid the dirty places and to eat the good food, just stay in 5 stars and eat in 5 stars.

03d0cbfac12fca636244e5710c5b9bceaa	I kinda agree with mr singh..!   it does seem like nonsense if someone said they had a good sleep and 'slept like a baby' when babies wake-up crying every couple of hours!    I also agree with the other guys who say it's something to do with having no worries...|`|0729e4ffaecaffcaaa283d6f4a188db1aa	while sleeping, the babies have no worry or nightmares or phone calls or workloads or anything stressfull in their mind..even if it was for a mere two hrs.|`|ibnB6HrGaa	I think they mean during the day time.

And everyone around them has to keep the noise level down or it'll end up with baby crying. I don't think people would go that far for anyone else.

xif22nwoaa	There are signs that will direct you to the proper places.    When you get to the airport in Indianapolis, you will check in for your flight at the desk of the airline with whom you are traveling.  They should give you a boarding pass for all of your flights; if you are switching airlines, they can't always do this, but they can help you take care of it at least.  Just ask the person checking you in.    They will write your departure gate on your boarding pass - it's typically a letter and a number - such as A13.  A is the concourse, 13 is the gate.      Follow the airport signs to your concourse.  At some point, you will go through security.  Make sure you follow the rules regarding carry-on baggage (www.tsa.gov).  You'll be asked to take off your shoes as well.    When you arrive in Minneapolis/St. Paul, find the nearest electronic board showing departures.  Look for the departure gate for your flight to LAX, and head that way.  You won't have to go through security again.  The signs are pretty clear, so you shouldn't get lost.    Same procedure once you land in LAX.    You'll have to go through customs when you land in Brisbane.  Again, the signs will be clear and it will be obvious where to go - just follow the crowd at that point.

KjF0p72naa	Go to a travel site if you plan to fly like Expedia.com  Go online to find the hotel you want and the rate avail per night on sites such as Marriott.com  Go to a car rental site like Enterprise.com for rental rates  If you plan to drive find your starting and ending cities and zip codes, figure the miles then the cost of gas and add some for CA.  Add in food costs and misc costs for each person.   Also the duration of your trip will make a HUGE impact on each man/womans' wallet!  Be safe and plan ahead always! (*sunblock*)

You can take either the Northeast Regional or the Acela service to New York's Penn Station.    You can also take SEPTA Regional Rail R7 Line from Philly to Trenton, NJ. Once there you can transfer to NJ Transit's Northeast Corridor Line to New York's Penn Station.    I hope this information is very helpful.    Good luck  Native New Yorker|`|cg5Ka4g2aa	Amtrak... check out there website. Amtrak.com|`|jLTDqVHsaa	Amtrak works, but...    You can use New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor Line, out of Trenton.  To get there, use the River LINE.  It connects Trenton and Camden.  SEPTA trains connect to the River LINE.  This costs less than Amtrak.    The Northeast Corridor Line goes right into New York Penn Station, at 34th Street/8th Avenue, with easy connections to the A/C/E/1/2/3 subways.  Connections are available from those lines to all other lines in the system.  You can also get the Long Island Rail Road at Penn Station.|`|y9N9YYXuaa	Like everyone says, there are two options,     1.  Amtrack which will cost you about $65 one way, but it is very easy. takes ~ 1.5-2 hours    2.  Septa R7 (Philadelphia regional rail) take that to trenton and then there is a NJ transit train that connects with it to go to NYC.  This is about $21.  The connection is not bad because they schedule them to connect with each other.   Takes about 2.5-3 hours|`|99f3375ecb12e908f1956b8e03fc4f44aa	its waaaaaay cheaper to take a greyhound or chinatown bus (like 12 bucks each way compared to a 70 dollar amtrak ticket)    http://www.staticleap.com/chinatownbus/

Huntington beach is sometimes very crowded, but it is really the best beach there is in Orange County. Just make sure there aren't any sponsered events going on while your there, or else it will be super crowded.

f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	nothing in the keys are cheap - I would suggest that you stop not in the Keys but some of the islands before the keys.     I've never seen a campground on Key West.    Here is a notice that they have on the main sites:    "To potential RV camping visitors - please check our RV/campground parks for reservations in advance before visiting the Florida Keys.     RVs and campers are not permitted to park overnight on residential streets in Key West, or alongside U.S. Highway 1 after 11 p.m. anywhere in the island chain. In addition, overnight parking in shopping centers or public parking lots is discouraged throughout the Keys and prohibited in Key West. This makes it important to make campground reservations, or at least call to check availability, to avoid being caught without an appropriate site.     Florida Keys campgrounds and RV facilities range from small properties with basic amenities to waterfront campground resorts with amenities including heated swimming pools and hot tubs, marina and dock facilities, onsite restaurants, gift and convenience stores, and coin laundries. Although they differ in location and amenities, virtually all are extremely busy each winter until the Keys' "high season" ends at Easter."    Here is the link for Big Pine Key and the lower Keys that has some campgrounds - this is one place though you don't want to 'wing' it.    http://www.fla-keys.com/listing.cfm?id=1...|`|uOQlAfVUaa	i dont think there is any cheap campgrounds in the keys.plan on spending about 1000 a month here.groceries are about 30 percent higher and gas is about 50 cents higher.welcome to the keys and bring a big wallet.

Shop St. Armands Circle.|`|3slZPTdvaa	Sarasota is very nice in March.  But honestly you should visit at a different time, if you can.  It gets really crowded, and the locals (if you should be driving) lose their patience with out of town drivers.  Also, the hotel/motels gouge their prices.  For example, the chain motels charge $45 a night, until Feb 15, then it's $60, until March 1, then it's $75 until April 15, then it goes back to normal.  It doesn't get too hot until mid-to-late June.

496f5606031f1da1dd8b5f7b0600439aaa	Permanent settlement in Nubia is dated to be contemporary with the Naqadda civilization of Upper Egypt c4500BCE and from extensive archaeological evidence is known to have existed before the establishment of dynastic Egypt and the first unification of Upper and Lower Egypt.  The land of Kush, was the term used by the ancient Egyptians for the region we know as Nubia.  From the rule of Pepi ll of of the Old Kingdom Egypt had established trade links and were military allies of their Nubian or Kushite neighbours.   Most of Egypt's gold came from the region of Kush and the Nubian archers were an integral part of the ancient Egyptian military and feared by their Libyan and Asiatic enemies.  The powerful Egyptian military assisted the Kushites to defend their borders against regular attacks by Libyan forces and excavations have revealed a line of forts that were built by the Egyptians to defend their Western borders and the Kushites.  These treaties and the Egyptian /Kushite alliance remained unchanged until the political and civil upheaval in Egypt during and after the Hyksos invasion c1600BCE.  The country was effectively split in two and this resulted in a much weakened Egypt which saw the withdrawal of the military from protecting the Western borders, its Kushite alliences and alleigences.  Egypt regained and expanded its power and control during the New Kingdom,an era which saw the emergance of some of its most powerful warrior pharaohs and the country was once again unified.  During the latter part of the 23rd dynasty c867 BCE the internal politics and machinations of the powerful priests of Amun assisted a Nubian born high priest to assume rule as the pharaoh Takelot lll, just as they had supported Hatshepsut to assume power many centuries beforehand.  During the rule of the 24th dynasty pharaoh Tefnakhte the ancient city of Memphis fell to the Kushites and the pharaoh was forced to swear his allegience to the Kushite ruler Piye whose temporary control of Egypt reached as far as the delta city of Sais.  So it was not really a simple case of Egypt's expansion into the land of Kush/ Nubia as was the case with the invasion of the Hyksos expansionists.   There is no doubt that if one of the New Kingdom pharaohs such as Rameses ll had decided to invade Kush and make it a vassel state of Egypt he could have very easily acheived this.

g05wGcPhaa	Lol this is Miami and the clubs will always be crowded no matter what day it is. Most clubs want the guys to be 21 or over and the ladies get to slip in at 18 in most places. Maybe you can just bribe the bouncer with Mr. Ulysses S. Grant ($50). Most likely they'll let you in since your almost 21. Your just not going to be allowed to drink.|`|3BjWyHzKaa	Miami always has an open club or bar!  That's one thing you don't have to worry about.  The clubs generally won't be as crowded on Sundays as they are during the rest of the weekend (unless there's something big going on in the city at the time like spring break season or a festival), but there will still be plenty of people there.      If you don't want to go to a crowded club on Sunday, go to Coconut Grove.  The hot days for The Grove are generally Thursday and Friday, so it's much quieter on Sunday.  Over your time in college there, you'll figure out the rhythm of the club scene, and you'll know which areas are crowded on what days.    Most places now require you to be 21+ to get in, but there are some bouncers that will let you slide (especially if you're with a group of girls).  Go with a group of people who are all 21+ to enhance your chances.  If you can, make friends with promoters and bouncers who will help you get in before the big 2-1.

4i59X44Laa	10 tips for Washington, D.C., tourists      By Kelly DiNardo, Special for USA TODAY   The ins and outs, quirks and curiosities of a city can take years to learn. If that doesn't quite fit into your time frame, you're in luck. With these tips, you'll manage your trip to Washington, D.C., like a pro.   RECOMMENDED EVENTS: Washington, D.C., is a year-round playground CITY GUIDE: Washington, D.C., attractions, hotels and more   1. Avoid driving. Legend has it that French engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant designed Washington's streets to confuse and frustrate enemy troops who might attack the city. Anyone attempting to navigate this city will understand why the legend persists. The city is divided into the four quadrants of a compass  NW, NE, SE, SW. The U.S. Capitol sits at the center of the quadrants, even though it is not at the center of the city, so Northwest is the largest area. The boundaries of each quadrant are North Capitol Street, South Capitol Street, East Capitol and the National Mall. That's where the street addresses start and become numbers and the letters of the alphabet. The lettered streets run east and west and numbered streets run north and south. To add to this directional befuddlement, the city also has many diagonal avenues (most of which are named after states) that run through a series of white-knuckle-inducing traffic circles. And beware the freeway ramps that appear out of nowhere and may take you across a bridge to Virginia before you know it.   2. Mind your Metro manners. The D.C. transit system prides itself on being one of the cleanest and most orderly in the country. A few simple dos and don'ts will help you navigate the Metro with ease. When on the escalator, do stand to the right and walk to the left, letting those in a hurry pass by. Don't eat or drink on the Metro. Do stand aside and take a moment to figure out where you are going. The direction a Metro train is going is determined by its final destination. For example, an Orange train heading west will say, "Orange Line to Vienna." There are large, clear maps in each station, so you should be able to figure it all out. Don't stop in the entry of the Metro car, but move completely into the car. Also, note our underground rail system is called the Metro, don't refer to it as the subway.   3. Consider fall. Visitors flock to Washington between April and August. The city can be unbearably hot and humid in the summer, which makes trekking around to all those outside monuments a sweltering affair. Remember, D.C. is lovely all year round  especially in the fall.      4. Visit your Congressperson. Call ahead for a visit with your local representative. Congressional offices can often offer special services and tips for visitors.   5. Eat your way around the world. Washington is a true melting pot with residents from around the world, which is reflected on the menus at area restaurants. Forget the chain restaurants you probably have at home. Instead, make like Columbus and discover the city's global palette. Local favorites include Mexican tapas at Oyamel, Indian at Rasika, Ethiopian at Etete, Italian at Dino and Belgian at Brasserie Beck.   6. Plan ahead. You can simply walk into many of Washington's attractions without tickets or reservations, but some of the biggies require a little advance preparation. Visitors interested in taking the self-guided tour of the White House must be part of a group of ten or more and request the tour through their member of Congress. You can submit a request up to six months in advance, but you won't learn the date and time of your tour until about a month in advance. Guided tours of the U.S. Capitol are available from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Free tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis at the Capitol Guide Service Kiosk beginning at 9 a.m. You must use your tickets when you pick them up. The same-day, free tickets to the Washington Monument can be difficult to get. For $1.50, you can make advance reservations through recreation.gov.   7. Pack your running shoes or bicycle. With over 200 miles of trails in Washington, jogging and biking are popular activities. Runners interested in taking in the monuments and looping around the Mall should aim for an early morning jog, as the area gets crowded later in the day. Or head to Rock Creek Park, an 1,800-acre maze of beautiful, well-marked trails, stretching 11 miles from the Lincoln Memorial to beyond the Maryland border. A paved path runs from the Kennedy Center through the park. You can also pick up trails near Dupont Circle and the National Zoo.   8. Go celebrity spotting. L.A. and New York have movie stars and models. In D.C. the power players are the politicos. Keep your eyes peeled and you might spot a few Washington celebrities. Classic power spots include The Palm and Off the Record, the bar in The Hay-Adams Hotel. For a power breakfast, visit Bistro Bis on the Hill or the Four Seasons in Georgetown. Speaker|`|cdf99d56c45f3f4e746f613838231bc5aa	-Check out the famous monuments and museums (White House, Monument, Capitol, Jefferson/Lincoln Memorial, Smithsonian Museums, Holocaust Museum, National Cathedral, National Zoo, Arlington Cemetery to name a few)    -depending on the season, you can check out the cherry blossoms festival and the parks around the area    -The nightlife in different areas of DC. There's something for everyone here (ex: Georgetown, U-Street, Dupont, Adams-Morgan, Downtown area)    -depending on the season, see a live sporting event. The Caps (hockey) are doing really good right now and hockey games are fun to watch. They also just opened the new baseball stadium and it's really nice in there, though the team sucks...sorry. Basketball and Soccer also available.    -The National Harbor in Maryland is filled with bars and restaurants as well as Old Town Alexandria in Virginia. Both by the water.    -Shopping in Georgetown. There's a ferry that goes from Oldtown to Georgetown (best in spring/summer)    -The food, there's plenty of choices here    -The metro is easy to use and will take you just about everywhere.    Best to go in the spring or if you can handle it, the summer and good in fall also. Winter here is kinda blehh.|`|OBA3Iciraa	Go the Washington Monument. Get there early in the morning, tickets sell out quick.  go to the museums down on 'the mall', they are free!  Call your senators office and see if you can get tickets to the White House.

Although the United Kingdom is not a member of the Schengen travel agreement for border-less travel in Europe the country participates in the Schengen Information System (SIS). This electronic system enables to detect persons which are looked for by a warrant of arrest in any European Union country as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. Also unwarranted people to those countries are added on the SIS. By scanning your passport data the system compares it with the list of unwarranted people or people subject to be arrested. That's the reason why you have to go first through immigration before you get your luggage and go through customs.  If the SIS should give an alert it will be forwarded to customs and you will be asked to go to a separate room for customs check. There you will be arrested without producing any public interest - smart system.

But plan your route, and measure the distance, and then decide if you can do it - and if you can afford the fuel.  Personally, I'd rather do something else for my vacation, but if this floats your boat, go for it.
oLhAi73caa	Transport tomorrow will most probably be deadlocked! (especially London)    The sleet, and snow will freeze tonight, leaving everywhere ten times as worse as it was today. Most of the schools have shut down due to a shortage of grit.     I'd see what its like in the morning, and if its icy, I'd recommend to work from home, otherwise you'll be stuck in traffic all morning (perhaps day!).|`|swbS13Xmaa	Who knows? its a few hours away.check the weather forcast.|`|hj952SLyaa	well tomorrow its supposed to be sunny so hopeully the only reason they werent working today was because the lines were frozen I had a nightmare!!!    so yes hopefully they should check the live status on national rail before u leave tomorrow    xx|`|NWwKrrC3aa	Its difficult to say, although its gonna be better weather. The ground is going to be an 'ice rink' said the weather guy. So it may be difficult for buses to drive.  I guess we'll have to wait and see|`|23f7ac49529b5e0cc83ad31f7308c088aa	The buses are running now (reduced frequency, and only on important routes), as is 80% of the tube network.    With luck things from today are sorted, so unless we see more snow on a scale seen today, I expect things will be running tomorrow, even if with delays.    Before you set out check this link for the latest information.    http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/livetravelnews...|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Yes they will run but not on time.|`|V8uvefQDaa	Try tfl website

AA11732565	I have moved on impulse in the past and it has always turned out to be a huge mistake so I caution you to go slowly on this. I think you should visit there a few times and go during different times of the year (I wish I had!). My sister moved from Boston to Fl but had only been there during the winter-it turns out that she can't stand the heat and humidity in July and August so she returns to New England for the summer. Two other things come to mind: work and college. The pay scale there is much less than in Boston so if you plan to work be prepared to receive a smaller paycheck and possibly fewer benefits. The cost of living might be less there but you get less in terms of community services,education and health care. If your children are at a MA state school and they could lose their residency benefit. So proceed with caution. This has been a very long winter so thinking about  FL takes on a dreamy  quality.  I hope this helps.|`|URO3gDXcaa	i hope you like the klan.  there is a large klan population in tallahassee.  actually, the largest in the state.|`|Nb413oN5aa	Sounds like a good idea to me.

eulMjLtPaa	About $30, unless there's traffic.|`|IvMPh09baa	haha... $30?  NO way!    If you book a shuttle service, then yes about $30 but you need to book that beforehand... if you just find a shuttle service at the airport they will charge you more.    By taxi its about $50
IbEP2HV4aa	the first one built|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	I'm guessing the Alamo.    Seemed really small to me when I saw it.|`|q22ngVmkaa	It's actually the Gunther House, which was built shortly before the Alamo by German settlers. The Alamo by all accounts is the second-oldest (as far as we know given that the war demolished many buildings). The Menger Hotel is also built in the same period.|`|bwygouP8aa	Mission San Jose  The granary building is the oldest building to remain intact in Texas.  Completed prior to 1749.|`|g54r6hqFaa	The original church of San Fernando was constructed between 1738 and 1749. The walls of that church still stand today making it the oldest continuously operating cathedral in the United States and the oldest building in Texas.    http://www.sfcathedral.org/MAPS.pdf      http://www.sanantonioinsider.com/Attract...|`|NzuV7dQLaa	I would have to say San Fernando Cathedral. It was built by the first settlers from the Canary Islands back in the 1720's.
