rniBQ9NPaa	how annoying a mother in law can be lol..just kidding..I was also paranoid when i was on my first trimester..just like u i worried a lot..i try not to breath when we were on gas stations lol..dont worry baby will be fine..u have to talk to people around u though, let them know how u feel when they want to spray things while u r around..good luck with the pregnancy..take plenty of folic acid..i just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl 18 weeks ago...|`|PBQA8tJ0aa	nah|`|SndrZbn8aa	It sounds like you weren't exposed to it for very long. You shouldn't worry. I would ask her that in the future she give you a heads up before spraying chemicals like that.|`|re2ZtPV3aa	First of all, I am not a doctor. This is what I think - Nothing to be worried about. You are exposed to toxins every single day. Just because you noticed this one particular toxin does not mean your child will have ADD, be autistic, or have downs syndrome. No one knows the reasons kids are born with disabilities. Except the mothers who are abused or abused themselves. Obviously long exposure to toxins of high levels or the digestion / obsorbtion of high levels of toxins will have ill effects on an unborn, still developing fetus.|`|zcKSyrqIaa	i understand you're feeling protective, but have you thought about the fact that probably everyone is exposed to toxins everyday? maybe if you just try to make the best decisions like you're already doing, like "not hanging out with the mother in law," you'll do fine.<br>  <br>  save yourself from all that stress nonsense.
MmGTFuoTaa	I really hate to upset people on this subject, because most think it is 12 weeks but abortions in Australia are actually legalised up to twenty weeks gestation. Obviously people normally have them done before this point but they are allowable in some states until 20 weeks. I find this highly disgraceful, being twenty weeks pregnant with my 2nd child at the moment, but if you type in abortion legalities in Australia the information will come up.It does vary from state to state and if its for school you should be checking properly not asking on here. I knew this because a girl i worked with had a late term abortion and not because of any problems but of her own free will.|`|1giBkGvraa	The actual legal issue:   16 weeks.<br>  Morally:    Few clinics are keen to do anything over 12 weeks<br>  <br>  <br>  But I've worked in clinics, and I can tell you that a 16 week feotus is totally recogniseable as a tiny baby.  Which for me anyway, makes the whole choice more questionable.<br>  <br>  If you need an abortion, the sooner the better.<br>  <br>  but there are so many fantastic people out there who want to be parents, you could be an amazing selfless giver of life by adopting.<br>  <br>  Just think about it.|`|MW3Br5V8aa	its usually up too 12 weeks, and thats at a risk, most clinics will only do 8 weeks.|`|3n0hXTt7aa	16 weeks is standard|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Up to 12 weeks and then after that you can still get one but I think it's done differently or you need special permission or something. It varies by state too. I think it can go quite far like 20-24 weeks though but it's quite rare and only in the case of deformity.<br>  <br>  Check <a href="http://www.mariestopes.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.mariestopes.com.au</a> they have loads of info on the site as well as a live chat function during the day time so you could ask them and they would know.<br>  <br>  Harriet
75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	in todays economy, you pretty much need 2 working parents. but by you working as well, it gives your husband bonding time with your child also, which i think is great. we sorta do the same thing here, but i olny work 3 days on the weekends, but still we need a baby sitter at l east one day a week so that i can sleep before work. i would think that if your child spent 12 hours ina daycare...that to me would seem more negliectful, but honestly, sometimes we gotta do what we gotta do to make it. you just have to make the time you spend with your kids mean that much more:)|`|AA11254601	It takes a village to raise a child. No, that is not neglectful, that is actually providing for your kid.  You need to find another babysitter who will respect you, and to call the hotline for financail aid fruad on her and tell them the true siutation. that would make her think twice about being so judgemental about you while she is illegally defrauding teh governemtn.|`|AA11330115	I don't believe you are a neglectful mother...you are doing what you need to do in order to support your child and give her what she needs. As long as you make time for her and let her know that you are there for her, that is the important thing.|`|BtxQogSzaa	There are a couple of issues to your question...<br>  <br>  In answer to your actual Question...no i dont think Working mums are neglectful at all. Some people have to work to carry on with the life style they carry off...others prefer to work. <br>  I personally think the way you said you do it sounds very good, and well done for carrying that one off, i think you and your husband have the best intrests of child. <br>  <br>  However you can't say that all SAHM are bad either...I myself am a SAHM, simple because i want to look after my children myself, even if i did go to work i wouldn't be able to afford child care...it is very expensive and with the job my husbvand does we wouldn't be able to share the child care.<br>  <br>  Also the sitter you metioned who has claimed for food stamps...(we dont get this in the UK) well you can go and report her as this is fraud...we call it benefit fraud here. <br>  People like this sicken me!  <br>  <br>  But no you are not a bad mother because you work...you are provading for your family, that isn't a bad mother...a bad mother is someone who can not be bothered to do anything!!!|`|EPKyXx8paa	There's no way anyone could ever accuse you of being neglectful.  Personally, when I start having children I am going to be a SAHM but ONLY because my husband and I can afford it.  I have no problems with having to work with children.  My mother was a single mom and raised me working 40 hours a week (and overtime, I was a latchkey kid by the age of 13) and I never felt that I was being neglected.  She took excellent care of me and spent every minute with me that she could, and I love her all the more for being able to support us on her own.|`|mNzgWFkGaa	No i don't see a working mother as neglectful nor do i see anything wrong with stay at home mothers because you know it doesn't really matter if a mother works or not; you get good mothers and 'bad' mothers in all walks of life. I think this person has just used this as a poor excuse because she doesn't want to work for you any more and she knew that by saying that in the way she did it would hit a raw nerve. And yes you are right that she is being hugely irresponsible by continuing to collect benefits, maybe that's all right for a little while just  to tide someone over but there are limits and i wouldn't like to think what trouble they could be in when the authorities catch up, they take a very dim view if someone knowingly continues to falsely claim money they are not entitled to, then where would her children be?|`|x0bJmyDPaa	Not neglectful, no.  The way I see it, continuity of care is the most important thing for a child this young, and you seem to have that sorted out.  Your daughter knows it's either going to be you or your husband for the most part, with a babysitter for only an hour a day.  Seems a pretty good thing to me - I mean, the bills still have to be paid somehow, and not everyone is cut out to be a stay at home mother.  I think you're doing the best you can.  The only thing I'm curious about is when do you sleep?  Do you manage to get ANY sleep at all with working at night and having to mind your daughter during the day??|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I can imagine neglectful working parents, just as I can imagine neglectful stay-at-home parents.  But being a working parent does not make someone neglectful.<br>  <br>  It's hard to hear a comment like that, even when you know it's wrong.  But I guess I'd just say consider the source.  It doesn't sound like this person's value judgments generally are terribly good.  Write it off as a good thing that you can find a babysitter with a stronger value system.|`|2eoAqicdaa	Not at all! how are you neglecting your child if you have a babysitter?<br>  If you went to work and left your child unattended then yeah that would be neglecting... maybe you should consider changing your babysitter <br>  How dare she say that! I know a couple that both have to work due to the mortgage etc and their child is perfectly fine... he's 2 and can read books and still has a strong bond with his parents...<br>  Sometimes a child needs to be away from their parents its good for both of them... parents need a break/to work and the children need to get a bond with someone else other then their parent(s) and to get used to being around different people <br>  <br>  I need to start putting my little one into nursery once a week. <br>  He's 14 months and getting very attached to us, we never really go out so we don't need babysitters and the family doesn't help out at all with anything so were stuck on our own,<br>  (my partners not well and I have a bad back) <br>  (slipped disc) so it can get pretty hard sometimes looking after him but still the family wont help|`|kprKXEOSaa	Look, you have to make your own decisions about what goes on in your family.  I personally don't understand having children if you're not going to raise them yourself, which you're not doing.  Your kids are with you mostly when they are asleep, the baby sitter is really raising your baby.  I understand that circumstances happen and women have to go to work when they don't want to, but I personally don't understand having babies when you plan all along that you won't be with them for most of the day.  This isn't an answer you're going to appreciate, I'm sure, since I'm not telling you you're right and she's wrong.  It's my opinion.  Babies don't care about "quality" time, they want quantity.<br>  <br>  Woa, I just re-read your post.  If your child is with a sitter for just an hour a day, no, you're not neglecting your child.  I have no idea how you get enough sleep, but you're with her during the day.  It's great she gets so much time with her daddy, too.  Get a new sitter.|`|sxecXFgraa	Being a working mom is not neglectful.  Quality over quantity.  I know plenty of SAHM that do nothing with their kids but sit at home in front of a computer or put them in a stroller and walk around the mall all day.  That's not quality time with the kids.  And what she is doing is wrong.  She's teaching her kids it's OK to lie and steal which IMO, is neglectful of their needs.<br>  <br>  Don't let idiots like her or revenge get to you.  There's always going to be people who try to put you down because they think they're way of doing something is the only right way.|`|wENdWT5kaa	No, its NOT neglectful. Don't let that ignorant woman get to you. <br>  <br>  She isn't even being a good role model for her children. IF it was bad for a mother to work, she is 10X worse then that. <br>  <br>  BUT there isn't anything bad with working. It is NOT neglectful, it is providing a roof over your childrens head, with clothes on their back and food on their table, etc. Parents job is to take care of their children, and part of that is to provide what they need.<br>  <br>  You are doing a great job, don't let that ignorant BYOTCH get to you.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	She sounds neglectful. I would not want her watching my kids (if I had kids). What could she possibly teach them? I know a mother that works full time and is neglectful of her children because she may be a narcissist or just a bubble head. She's very selfish. She is the most important person in her universe. Her kids have problems - daughter is in counseling and I'm seeing problems with her son. She has custody. She can't be bothered with them. It's unbelievable. So if this woman wants to see what neglected kids look like - come out this way and let me show you. <br>  <br>  A neglectful parent is one that does not care about their kids and it shows. I'm sure she cares on some level but not enough to change anything she does. Everyone else must change for her. She is perfect, didn't you know. She will not budge. Right away - I know that's not normal. <br>  <br>  Ignore this woman and carry on. My only concern would be the health of your marriage with such a schedule so I would keep an eye out.
f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	it is normal to get strange periods sometimes but i would def take a test if u dont get ur period
iCmf2PUWaa	Well it could be possible that you can be pregnant if your 2 weeks late on your period and or had relations with anyone. The best advice i could give you is to take a pregnancy test or go to your doctor because it's the only way you'll really know and it'll stop all your worries.|`|1giBkGvraa	Yes.<br>  <br>  But the bad discharge isn't normal.  You could have pelvic inflammatory disease.  You could have caught a variety of STDs.<br>  <br>  Go see your doctor.|`|M5MJ0HbKaa	Yes you deff can be preg. but there are some things to consider. Have you been really stressed out with things recently??? If so your period could be just really late. This happened to me and i kept getting kinda sick and eating more and that kind of stuff... I was 50 days late for my period so i went to my dr. when i was your age and he said that i was not preg but i was so stressed and i was on to many sports teams and so i was over working my body. but my period finally came. and i was ok... but if i were you i would take a preg test... or call your dr. if you cant go see your dr or get a preg test for fear your parents would find out or something then i would go to a place like planed parenthood i dont know if your town has one but it should have something like it...  they will give you a preg test for free.|`|I1Fnj0rHaa	those are the synptoms, but u must see a doc coud be std
yZDyUfSNaa	Yes. Octomom doesn't have a husband or partner to help her care for you children nor does she have a job or income from anyone other than taxpayers and donations. Michelle Duggar has a husband, and while I don't watch the show and I'm sure it provides them with most of their money, I'm pretty sure he has a job as well.|`|3rda58OCaa	Wow, I never thought about that, but yes i would say there is a big difference.  As the others have said the Duggars can support their children and have plenty of facilities for each child and their home is complete with a mom and dad.<br>  <br>  In another way though they are the same.  There is no possible way either parent (Octumom/Michelle) can give each and every child the attention and love they deserve.  It is impossible to give 18 children daily the emotional care they need need from their parent(s).  It is a little easier for Michelle since she didn't have half of them at the exact same time, and has the older children to help with the little ones.  I don't think it is fair to any of the children involved, and neither parent cares about that.|`|q8tUfflyaa	Yeah, big difference.. although I do not agree with having 18 children (I dont see how you can give enough love and affection to all 18) I still believe that they are good parents, with a roof over their kids heads, food on the table, a bed to sleep in at night, an education, and they don't rely on donations for an income.<br>  <br>  Octomom on the other hand, has no husband, not even a support system, no job, no money, not enough beds, and she certainly doesn't have a clue.|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	The Octo mom needs help.  She is obviously a loving mother with two loving parents but she needs some psychological screening to see what "need" she is trying to fill by having all these babies.  don't say greed because she could have sensationalized her six with invetro<br>  and no daddy.  If she had eight total, which is what she thought she would have, would everyone be is such an uproar?  She would have been able to finish school and pay taxes the rest of her life.  Now since she had eight instead of two more, we might have to support her and her babies.  At least my tax dollars are going for someone who lives in the United States and not some foreign country that our tax dollars get sent to every day.|`|cteyFJxhaa	Very big difference.  The Duggers are a family who disagrees with birth control and so work with whatever God sees fit to give them.  Octomom is scientifically planting kids like trees with no justifiable reason that I can see.|`|AA10529334	Yes Michelle is married, they have plenty of money to support their children!!!!! <br>  <br>  If this octuplet Mother had the money to support her children then I would not care how many children she had.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	uh yeahh!! the duggars live in a debt free home and provide for all their kids, and there are TWO parents in the equation!<br>  <br>  octo mom... i dont even need to say it.|`|3urQfMffaa	The duggars have 4 more kids than octomom haha.|`|aHlpWFVhaa	Yes. The duggars pay for their own kids.<br>  <br>  They built their own house.<br>  <br>  Why do people these days hate people who choose<br>  to have large families?<br>  <br>  That's very strange.|`|kprKXEOSaa	The Duggars are a married couple who conceive, bear and rear their children the old-fashioned way.<br>  Sex.<br>  One or two at a time.<br>  With their own money.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Uhh,yea, BIG difference<br>  Michelle can support her kids,she has a husband,all her kids have their own bed,and she lives in her own house with her husband and kids.<br>  <br>  While the stupid octo mom cant support her kids w/o other peoples money,she lives in her parents house..need i say more?|`|AA11355939	There certainly is.  The Duggars are a married couple that are self-supporting.  Michelle home schools her children and has made no attempt to have multiple births (although she has had one set of twins).  At the present time her husband's parents live with them, each child has their own bed, everyone is given a bath regularly and there is plenty of laundry done, kids kissed, no one resents the new baby, and every one is productive.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	YES,,,,,the duggars support their children,,,and i think the reasons for having them are COMPLETELY different,,,i have never heard the duggars say they longed for children because they were a lonely only child.  i do not see how you can compare the TWO|`|vI0WnAiOaa	aahh yes, one has a husband and a home to bring up all those kids and also she doesnt have 8 infants at once that all need attantion.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Uh. Yes.<br>  The Duggars can support their children.
1jwbQaZTaa	we use the gerber graduate sippys for night time in place of a bottle because they dont leak everywhere if she falls asleep!  you can give her a sippy in place of a bottle at any time of day.. <br>  <br>  good job on starting early with the weaning, if you wait too long its like nails on a chalkboard!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I used a sippy cup for bedtime milk, for about 2 weeks, then my daughter decided she didn't want a drink of milk at bedtime.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	we use sippy cups for just about everything. sometimes we use a straw :)

xGI9z01Maa	It's normal.  Each women is different.  Stress and other items can make them come sooner or later then normal.  My daughter started her first in Dec and she has not had one since.  After having children, most women have period abnormal for several months.  I have one every 28 day but once in a while is was 2 to 4 days off before I was on birth control.   <br>  <br>  This just means that you will have a harder time know when the next one is coming.|`|BU3A3rR4aa	ask a doctor|`|NuiHXYuOaa	once a month lasting between 4-5 days is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  being young your period can be in a bit of a pickle but it settles out fine!|`|XVVkrlnTaa	You will count the days from when your period start to when it start again. So you have a 23 day cycle. It looks quite normal to me. You are regular and that is a good thing.|`|G19tKe43aa	Wow now i really think women are complicated they keep dates of this stuff!|`|iWdDUvSlaa	omg ur so lucky u only get it for like, 4 days! <br>  i get it for like 7 at a time, luckky yoou|`|Yt7XFaO8aa	Well, first and foremost, everybody is different. Periods can last roughly between 3 - 8 days, but everybody's different. You seem to be only having them for four days, which is completely normal. The most average time is about 5 so your not that far off. You can get your period roughly every 3 - 4 weeks so your number is pretty accurate so its all good :)
xGI9z01Maa	It sounds like you are but the test can be wrong if they are old or it read too early or too late or they would in a hot place during shipping or something.  Also, it sounds like you did it in the evening and not your first pee in the morning.  They have you do it first thing in the morning because the thing that the test is looking for is higher in early morning then later in the day.  <br>  <br>  And an extremely light period can be a sign of  spotting when pregnant.  Usually you have to see the doctor when this happens to make sure everything is alright.<br>  <br>  You might want the doctor to check.  Their test can show before the counter test can.  But also you might have something going on if you still have the other things going on.  It could be that you have something stuck and the doctor might need to clean it out which is faking your body is pregnant.  But I would first try the PG test in the morning.  Try a different type as well at a different store.|`|3n0hXTt7aa	I know what you mean.<br>  And yes, its possible in early pregnancy to have a negative test result.<br>  Also, the "period" was probably implantation bleeding.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Did you do the test properly? If there is too much or not enough pee, they dont work properly, and can give a false negative.<br>  <br>  When is your next period due? If you concieved JUST before your last period, this might explain the light period (this is what happened to me last time) and why you got a negative this time.  Wait until you are due next time and try and test again.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Claire|`|0MUvGlHkaa	I had the same symptons with my 3rd child flu like symptons sore boobs very grumpy and just plain tired. 3 pregnancy test were all negative so i wld suggest getting a blood test done as you may not have enough of the pregnancy hormone for a pregnancy test to confirm a yes you are pregnant u may even have a phantom pregnancy where yr body thinks your pregnant but yr not so certainly contact yr gp
BU3A3rR4aa	huh?|`|cJRFbZUaaa	The morning-after pill can make you feel ill.  Remember that you just took a big dose of hormones in a short period of time.  Go to your doctor if the ill feelings persist.|`|1caa6e9202544c5458c9c4eed7baa473aa	It is not 100% reliable. I took the morning after pill the morning after a slip up, and now have a healthy and wonderful nearly 9 year old boy because it didn't work! My visits to the doctor resulted in them putting me on anti-depressants as they didn't believe I could be pregnant!  Thankfully there were no side effects and after extra scans to be sure, I relaxed and enjoyed my unexpected pregnancy...I was lucky. <br>  I did feel ill after taking the pill, and followed the directions exactly, so was sure it had worked. It's true the hormones affected me, but not the way they should have done!  You can get some early tests now, to be sure.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	yes theres is a chance because the morning after pill doesnt terminate the baby so if you already were then u still will be but heresw the thing it take tops 72 hours before sperm reachesegg and implants its self in the egg so if that didnt already happen and u took the pill the pill will pretty much not alow the sperm to go any farther lol. . and like this other person said you may be feeling funny because of the hormons you just taken. youll know if you are if you miss your period. if you r then you r and ull kno if u aint then u aint.|`|6Fhez4t0aa	The pill can make you feel ill, but is completely normal the first 3 days. If the pain continuous you may go to the doctor and he probably change your pills for others.<br>  Bisous!|`|e05gbvlDaa	what do you mean by funny?|`|6GA1RFN0aa	the pill after the f***k and the f***k after the pill doesn't make any difference,,,, ok njoy
lEJCZP0Qaa	this happened with my daughter, i was 2cm dilated for 3 months. My doc explained to me at the hospital that alot of women can be around1-2 cms dilated for months befor the baby is due and its nothing to worry about. Sadly the hip pain is a horrible side effect with this stage of pregnancy there is a name for this condition but can't think what its called, i know i read in what to expect that when pregnant your body relaxes or something and your hips become dislodged and soft(if you google severe hip pain in pregnancy it should explain better than i can). Another one is the lower back, mine has gone already and im only 4 months but have a bad back anyway. And braxton hicks can be painful, mine were horrible. I think you need to sit tight and wait for naure to take its course because i know when i was examined at 36 weeks i was in pain, lost my plug and Phoebe was born at 41 weeks. <br>  <br>  good luck hun xx|`|BU3A3rR4aa	boost of energy is a sign.|`|ghUExPxgaa	don't know, i'm 38 weeks and been in horrible pain since 34 weeks due to baby decending and being fully engaged, also get the shooting pains, lots of tightenings and pelvic pressure, sore/tender brests for a couple of weeks, just went to womens assessment due to uti and i'm 1cm too, they have no idea when proper labour will start. I had massive energy surge yesterday, i re-organised every wardrobe in the house, and today less enrgy, still waiting, hope she hurry's up soon!!!|`|AA10780655	never know, it could be tomorrow or it could be in weeks<br>  Im 39 1/2 weeks and Ive been walking around at 4cms for 2 weeks and still no baby! :-(<br>  But if you ever feel like something isnt right, dont hesitate to go up to Labor&Delivery. The worst thing they can do is send you home, but it'd be better to know everything is ok<br>  I've been up to L&D about 5 times in the past month, for false and stalled labor.|`|33b14b7e99d6f8aaa409f58b9bf4fc61aa	u would think it is very near but unfortunately babies are so unpredictable. it could be weeks yet or it could be tomorrow lol ur signs show u r close but who knows.  with my 2nd daughter i had signs from 38 weeks and she was still 11 days overdue .good luck|`|M5MJ0HbKaa	CONGRATS!!!!!

Frustrating I know, but it's in the hands of God/Nature/Luck.  I started all the above symptoms from about 36 weeks, but all three of mine were born at 42+ weeks.  I spent 8 of the nine months with the last one at 2cm dilated.  Good luck though and enjoy the last few days/weeks of your pregnancy x|`|PeEIuzP5aa	Will it sounds like you will be having your baby vary soon, If he is wanting sex in the next 2 weeks No, you will not be healed right, take your time and have some fun with your new bron. you'll have lots of time for that.<br>  Good Luck and congrats

cJRFbZUaaa	For you, it's probably a combination of pregnancy hormones and stopping smoking.  If you're like most women, your body will eventually get used to not having cigarettes and to being pregnant, so you'll mellow out a bit, but it doesn't go away completely.  That's not such a bad thing, either.  After all, you've got a baby coming and shouldn't be taking BS!|`|AA12192295	You just have to stop and take a breath when you start to flip out. It happened to me a lot. And it was ever worse if I was hungry. I turned into a monster if i needed food and would go off about nothing. I'm 11 weeks now and its not as bad but it still happens. I am learning to catch myself when it happens and leave the room to calm down.|`|NpFmdjlvaa	im 35 weeks and i know exactly how you feel!! im like that now!! i find myself shouting at my son when hes done somethin so silly and feel so bad after shouting at him, and everythin that everyone does winds me up.. its horrible isnt it these bloody hormones!!<br>  the 2nd trimester isnt so bad hun!<br>  <br>  <br>  so you have a little break in between!<br>  congrats and good luck<br>  <br>  :)|`|1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|vOaa2d1Daa	Eat some dark chocolate...have your hubby rub your feet. Hve your hubby wash your hair& give you a good massage on yer belly where the baby lives and he and you don't even know it yet. Understand that you're both waiting for this human being you've co-created to evolve into the self-sufficient sentient being he/she shall be. Tell him how you feel and have him hold you whilst you thrash about. It'll build the faith that you have in each other through this wonderful time in your lives that you want to share with each other and not against each other....huh?|`|rniBQ9NPaa	I was like that on my first tri, i got better on the 2nd tri and worst on the third trimester...u just have to deal with it...u have to explain to people around u that its the hormone thing..quitting smoking made it worst..but u did it for the best|`|KqloS80maa	no it only gets worse im 8 almost 9 months and i snap at everything ....|`|heoBp6Taaa	It's hormones hunny..  you'll be angry 1 minute crying the next.. Your body is producing bulk amounts of hormones to feed and nourish your baby.. It's perfectly normal. Most people will understand because your tired and hormonal, especially your mum, they'll forgive you for your outbursts.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck with the pregnancy.
stRWElvPaa	I think that as she took the morning after pill within 72 hours then everything should be ok. Plus the birth control pill makes the womb unsuitable to implant into, and the mucus at the cervix (opening to womb) is thick so that it's hard for the sperm to penetrate. So I think you can relax but just make sure to take a pregnancy test in a week to make sure.|`|6GA1RFN0aa	if the problem comes she has face y u r worried i don't know, u think about urself dont think abot her she knows very well about these kind of things and all....|`|pzLDXL6gaa	If she took it on Saturday and missed the placebo break, she's probably fine. I think the morning after pill was unnecessary and it's not good to take while on the pill but that will lower your chances even more so you're probably fine.<br>  <br>  Harriet
1VaH8D3Raa	As much as he can get here and there<br>  .<br>  Not all at once<br>  .|`|kprKXEOSaa	It does depend on how much he's sleeping at night, but most babies aren't ready to skip their daytime naps.  Every child is different, but if you can tell your baby is tired, he's not getting enough sleep.  You may need to look at your routine.  Sometimes if a child gets overtired, then they can't sleep, they get their second wind.  You may need to put him down for his nap sooner, rather than waiting until he's so tired.  Sleep schedules are hard, but you've got to do your best to help him get the sleep he needs and form good habits.  Good luck!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	My son started doing that at five months of age. He got enough sleep at night so would only take 2 - 15 minutes naps a day. Sounds very normal to me if he is getting enough sleep during the night.|`|wCRC0poAaa	i often think about the same thing myself and envy those whose kids take decent naps during the day and sleep 12 hrs at night.<br>  my twins (11 months now) never ever took long naps during the day (and never at the same time as each other either lol). at the mo im going a bit mad because they take one 45 min nap at lunch time and sleep about 7 hrs at night, waking up once during the night for an hour or two (again at different times to each other). this leaves me with about 4 hrs out of the 24 for sleep and housework. those teeth better break through soon !!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	My son at that age was the same. He would only sleep for 30 minutes in the day and 10 hours at night.<br>  <br>  My older daughter still slept for 3 hours in the day and 11 hours at night at that age. Even when she was 3, she slept for 2 hours in the day.<br>  <br>  But my son is now 3 and a half and hasn't slept in the day since he was about 18 months old.|`|i3EhpLwfaa	18 hrs|`|9EAW8PXkaa	Nobody on here can tell you what is wrong.But when my son was 6 months old,he took a nap 2x a day for 2 hours each and slept 10-12 hours at night.So even though every baby is different..at 6 months he should be sleeping much much more.He probaby is having trouble falling asleep because he is overtired bc he doesnt sleep enough to begin with.I would visit the pediatrician or at least call and ask in which they will probbaly tell you to bring him in anyway so they can examine him.|`|ZRR134TQaa	Hi Princess<br>  <br>  I had the same problem with my little one she is 4 months old.  They are going through a growing spurt they are a wake for a long period and sleep for 10 - 15 min.  That is called power napps and cat napps.  What you can use for it is chamomilla it is a powder that you add to their milk and it is 100% save for them.  You can buy it at any chemist.|`|jsjkTEokaa	It sounds like he doesn't know how to get back to sleep by himself. My 8 month old was exactly the same and is only just getting to grips with it now! He would only have two 30 minute naps during the day and then by bedtime was so overtired he would cry for up to an hour while I rocked and cuddled him.<br>  <br>  What worked for me was waiting around in his room when the 30 minutes were nearly up and then as soon as he stirred I'd settle him back to sleep first by picking him up and rocking him and later on just by putting his dummy in and patting his back. Because he was much better rested, after a few weeks I could put him in his cot at bedtime and let him fall asleep by himself. Sometimes he would play for a while but I would just check on him every now and again and lay him down gently and give him his dummy and a kiss. If he cried I'd go to him straight away and settle him down because I could never leave him to cry. He now sleeps through the night and takes 3 longer naps during the day. It took about 6 weeks but it was worth it!
T7BKri0Faa	I cant say that when this happened to me everything was fine because i suffered a miscarriage. but youve had one scan that is normal so that is defintly a good sign.. none of my scans came back normal. I just want to wish you good luck and try to be very careful and rest as much as possible.<br>  <br>  It is known that some women bleed all the way through thier pregnancy so try not to stress.<br>  <br>  my prayers are with you|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Postal dude, what on earth are you on about?  13 weeks pregnant, not 13 years you freak!! Open eyes, read question THEN open mouth.<br>  <br>  I have read from previous answers that you have lost a baby before, so I can understand your concern.  My sister in law was 13 weeks with her now toddler, and she had a bleed after she fell and hurt her hand.  I was worried sick for her, but she was just fine. If the bleeding has stopped and you feel ok, I think you will be just fine - but if you don't want to wait until tomorrow, ask your midwife or GP to check you over?  They will not mind and it will put your mind at rest.<br>  <br>  I am sure all will be well, good luck.<br>  x|`|BU3A3rR4aa	if u had sex couple days pior to that...tthat'swhat that bleeding is from. i had that too when i was 16 weeks pregnant|`|ghUExPxgaa	i had bleeding at 13 weeks with my first, i was hit in the stomach by a down syndrome client of mine, they couldnt tell where the bleeding was coming from, but after a scan they said baby was fine. Did you recently have sex? That can cause bleeding in some people, and it doesnt harm the baby, wish you luck, but as long as theres no cramping, i think everything will be ok : )|`|PeEIuzP5aa	Yes I did, and all they told me was, it was like I was back on the time of the moth, so it can happen, they told me that it was normal to have and it will go away.  so hang in there.<br>  good luck.|`|758cDKEFaa	ive had slight bleeding at 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 (heaviest out them all) and 14 weeks!<br>  im now 17 weeks and 3 days and my baby is fine :)|`|kQMt51iraa	you should see your doctor at the earliest. It doesnot sound bad but still to be on the safer side.<br>  Best of Luck.|`|1caa6e9202544c5458c9c4eed7baa473aa	I've had 3 babies, and never spotted or bled once - I had a few 'mis-haps', falls etc, but no serious worries. <br>  I understood from reading magazines on childbirth etc that it is quite normal for some women to bleed, as we are all different.  This may be the case for you, it may not, but always, if any doubt get checked!
75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	it depends on the fever, how high is it? does it come down with tylonal? doesn't your peditrition have an on call nurse you can speak with?|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Take her temperature and give her some child's painkiller (they all reduce fever as well). If it's a really high temperature (104-ish) call the ER right away and ask for advice. In any case sponge her down with cool (not cold) water.<br>  <br>  If it's a bit lower, wait half an hour after giving the medicine and take it again. If it hasn't dropped, call the ER (or doctor, whatever out-of-hours service you have available) and discuss it with them. If it's dropped, just keep her as cool and comfortable as you can.<br>  <br>  Don't take her to the ER unless it's an emergency - i.e. a very high temperature which won't come down, or other worrying symptoms. There will be people in that waiting room with really serious illnesses, and she could catch something horrible when she only went in there with a cold.|`|axWE0Ag3aa	Here is some helpful information on infant/child fevers!|`|xGI9z01Maa	If it goes up, hospital.  Try baby tylenol and a warm bath but don't have the babies eyes under the water.  These will usually take the temp down.  If the temp is 104, go to the hospital.  But a temp is not a big deal in a young child like it is to an adult.  This is just normal with a child.  She should be fine in by tomorrow or the next day and you will be the one that will need a nap.  Don't worry if possible.  I'm the oldest of 7 and have 3 of my own.  But if it will make you feel better, take her to the hospital.  Your piece of mind is as important as her getting better.|`|1EKMsuXpaa	Take her to the doctor if it's a high fever.
jBdvUQEXaa	Take a test.  You could be - sooner you find out the better It is quite common to have some bleeding around the time of when you were supposed to have a period and is known as implantation bleeding.  If you arent then please use reliable contraception in future!<br>  <br>  Claire
iCqfmRC3aa	Good for you. In today's society we see so many children with body issues and a lack of self esteem. It is not an issue, except for some that are embarrassed by nudity. Probably a result of being taught that the body is shameful and to be hidden... so sad.  Our body is a great creation and has nothing to do with sexuality, all sexuality comes from the mind.<br>  <br>  Studies show that children who grow up in a nudist setting tend to be more self-confident, more self-accepting, and more sexually well-adjusted. They feel better about their bodies, and more comfortable with their sexuality.<br>  <br>  Research conducted at the University of Northern Iowa found that nudist children had body self-concepts that were significantly more positive than those of non-nudist children--and that the "nudity classification" of a family was one of the most significant factors associated with positive body self-concept. Furthermore, nudist children showed a significantly higher acceptance of their bodies as a whole, rather than feeling ashamed of certain parts. A study by psychologists Robin Lewis and Louis Janda at Old Damien University reported that "increased exposure to nudity in the family fosters an atmosphere of acceptance of sexuality and ones body." They concluded that children who had seen their parents nude were more comfortable with physical contact and affection, had higher self-esteem, and showed increased acceptance of and comfort with their bodies and their sexuality. Research by Marie-Louise Booth at the California School of Professional Psychology found that "individuals with less childhood exposure to parental nudity experienced significantly higher levels of adult sexual anxiety than did the group with more childhood exposure to parental nudity." Separate research by Diane Lee Wilson at The Wright Institute reached the same conclusion. Research by Lou Lieberman of the State University of New York at Albany, in the late 1960s, found that "those young people who had casually seen both of their parents nude in the home were far more likely to feel comfortable with their bodies and to also feel more satisfied with the size and shape of their genitalia and breasts." <br>  <br>  See the sources below for more information.<br>  <br>  I recommend you continue with your open attitude, <br>  <br>  This year, since the economy is going to be a bit down anyway, you could save some money and take a "stay-cation" that is a stay close to home vacation. Have you ever gone skinny-dipping? Take your family on vacation to a clothing optional beach or resort. You can find a family oriented resort by making sure it is a sanctioned American Association for Nude Recreation (aanr) resort. Go to aanr.com and find one near you.<br>  <br>  The naysayers are in the minority, 74% of Americans approve of nude recreation in appropriate settings. Fully 55 Million have freely acknowledged skinny dipping with members of the opposite sex. Nudity is no longer taboo, it has come out as a mainstream recreation. Last year Americans spent over $450 Million on nude recreation. <br>  <br>  At the resorts you will find mainly professionals or white collar workers with most being college graduates that are open, honest and friendly. They will do their best to make you feel welcome and your family will be safe and secure.<br>  <br>  Think about it, you are teaching your children body acceptance, in addition to a better way to relax and grow stronger as a family. <br>  <br>  Your children are being slammed by TV, radio, peers and newsprint to be sexual creatures. <br>  <br>  But, instead by being open and honest about your body, you are teaching by example how they can be open, honest and full of self esteem. <br>  <br>  By showing them that you are not ashamed of your body, you are teaching them not to be ashamed of their bodies, for you to suddenly change and tell them everyone should be covered at all times, you would be indicating that there must be something wrong with the human form, both yours and theirs.<br>  <br>  Is that the image you want them to have of you, that you are ashamed to be seen without being covered? Of course not and I applaud you for it.|`|kprKXEOSaa	My son is 5.  He sees me naked all the time.  As he gets older, I'm sure he will think it is weird, so there will have to be more privacy, but that's normal.  My daughter who is 2 sees daddy naked, too.  It's no big deal and helps children understand the difference between boys and girls, and how girls grow up to be mommies and boys grow up to be daddies.  <br>  A friend of mine is so weirded out by her sons seeing her naked, it's strange to me.  It's like if her 5-year-old son wants to watch her breastfeeding her infant, he's a pervert or it's sexual or something.  She's very weird about it and I don't understand that mentality.  She has only sons, so if they don't see her naked, I guess the Playboys when they're teenagers will be the first naked women they will see--or internet porn.  Yikes.|`|8ELfnTODaa	i also don't see why this is an issue. as long as you're not teaching them that it's ok to see like all women nude or anything like that who is everyone else to judge?|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I agree - unless you are intentionally showing your body to them, then there is nothing wrong with it. Hello, they came out of your body, it's not like it's un-natural! Granted, when they get to puberty age,  and probably for a while before then too, it would be better to be more careful, but if children never see nudity, how do they know what is normal? Like when they start growing hair in places etc, at least they won't be confused about it and too embarrased to ask.<br>  Like you, I don't walk around naked - but I'm not putting a lock on my bedroom door to stop my child from walking in on me getting changed!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	There is nothing sexual about a naked body. It's what other people perceive that naked body to represent, that makes it sexual. Your children aren't looking at your body in a sexual way and it's YOUR children that are going to grow up with a normal and healthy attitude towards nudity, women's bodies and sex. The problem is the narrow-mindedness and "minds in the gutter" mentality of people in the US. The kind of people that make "conservatism" a dirty word. There are people like that in Australia and England but the biggest offender when it comes to turning something innocent into something perverse is the United States of America.<br>  In Europe, the attitude towards nudity and sex is much more relaxed and yet, compared to the US, England and Australia, the average age of intercourse is higher and teen birthrates, abortions and std rates are significantly lower. I think that speaks volumes as to how the attitude towards nudity and sex in the US, Australia, UK etc is more damaging than beneficial.<br>  I live in a hot climate. So when I'm at home I am just in my underwear. I also still shower with my son who is just 23 months old. I see nothing wrong with this. I'll continue to walk around in my underwear until I sense, or my son says, that he is uncomfortable with me doing so.<br>  Rest assured, you're doing nothing wrong.|`|AA10529334	Well im sorry but I personally think those boys are too big for you to be around them naked.  I think once a boy reaches 5 or 6 Mom should make every effort to not be nude around them.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Ok i agree with the other ages but a nine year old is reaching the age of liking girls so i would find that a no no.|`|bpsO6v0laa	I also have two sons aged 6 and 9 they also see me naked, if they need to speak to me wile i'm in the shower or getting dressed then i don't see a problem like you say i don't openly walk around naked. Now my son has turned 9 i do try to get him to wait outside the door if i'm getting dressed just because i feel he needs to be aware he is getting older and sometime we forget just how big they are getting. I'm sure there will come a point very soon when he doesn't want to see you naked till then i think what you are doing isn't really an issue.|`|AA11254601	Things happen.

zK1V9Mu7aa	I thought I was the only one who experienced that lol, but when I went into labour the contractions hurt way more when I was laying down and I also found moving would bring on a contraction. I found that walking would ease them up, they'd still come and go, but not half as bad.<br>  I would phone your midwife and not wait for the DRs appointment because you are 34 weeks. They will need to try and stop labour coming or give you some drugs to make sure babies lungs are strong enough to cope on the outside world.<br>  Good Luck and get phoning your hospital!<br>  x|`|MW3Br5V8aa	yeah i'd wait and cal the docors office or even the ante natal dept at hospital there is usually a midwife on hand too answer ur call.. <br>  <br>  best of luck :)|`|tbuNZqJsaa	Im not good with maths.. and plus i cbf working out how many months 34 weeks is<br>  <br>  But I think that calling a doctor is a good idea<br>  <br>  Congrats on the baby!|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	at 34 weeks you dont want to go into full active labor so i'd of called dr right away and got seen, or went to maternity ward, the babys lungs at 34 weeks arn't that fully developed, they'd probally hold of labor until your 36 weeks just for full development<br>  <br>  good luck|`|BU3A3rR4aa	ouch ! i think u just read my mind ! im having this problem right now as im typing !

(I'm 40 weeks tomorrow).  Sometimes they do wrap right around your back.  I find if I haven't emptied my bladder in a while they are worse, or if I haven't emptied the other way (sorry tmi).  It sounds like they aren't coming at regular intervals.  They should be exactly 5 mins apart or exactly 8 mins apart to be real contractions.  So I would have a bath or a shower and drink a couple of glasses of water (dehydration makes them worse) and see if they calm down.  You'll probably find they will stop or get less frequent.  If they intensify and get more regular and closer  (eg 3 mins apart), then go to hospital.
0MUvGlHkaa	in a way your body is getting use to being sleep deprived lol i try a bath and light candles or read a book and its so hard to get comfortable when your that far ahead but try to relax otherwise you will get grumpy and certainly wont sleep. or get up do something and try go back to bed again|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	this is normal during pregnancy. i would suggest trying to maybe read a book or something that you enjoy that is relaxing. remember being pregnant it is better to atleast rest even if your not sleeping much. i wouldnt take anything till you consult a doctor first.

lkNJNnlSaa	I am totally against it.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	As a mother, I hate the thought of it, but, I understand the need for it.<br>  <br>  I do not think it is right to bring a severely disabled (to such a point as they are just a vegetable or in pain) child into the world, I do not think it is right to force a woman to carry on with a pregnancy that could kill her if this is the case.  A woman who has been raped should not have to deliver her rapists baby if she does not feel strong enough.  <br>  <br>  I do believe that it should have a limit of say 18 weeks, by which time most women know they are pregnant, I think 24 weeks is far too close to viability for a child and abortions should not be performed around this time.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I also agree with those who say it should not be used as a birth control, they are quite right, women should not need more than one abortion, unless for medical reasons.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	I think that abortion should be a womans choice.  However, if sexually active people were more responsible in their actions by using contraceptives properly then there would be less need for women to resort to abortion in the first place.<br>  <br>  I also agree with abortion in cases such as rape or situations where the mother/babies lives are threatened in some way.<br>  <br>  It should not be a decision made lightly and it should not be used as an emergency contraceptive.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Pregnancy is a biological event which occurs inside the individual pregnant woman's body. As a result of that indisputable fact - any decisions she makes regarding that event are personally finally up to her - solely.<br>  <br>  The only other person who has any argument regarding those decisions is the biological father.<br>  <br>  Most certainly not the American justice system which is designed to incarcerate people for crimes.<br>  <br>  Private organizations or social services certainly have the right and responsibility to work to deter abortion through education and programs.. But not through bullets and bars.<br>  <br>  Furthermore no governing body should be provided the jurisdiction to govern decisions of this personal and biological nature.<br>  <br>  Abortion is a horrible and tragic thing - but so is draconian legislation. Two wrongs do not make a right.|`|8ELfnTODaa	That it is used as a method of birth control nowadays and THAT is wrong.<br>  <br>  i only find it should be used if the baby will kill the mother if carried to term or the pregnancy is the result of rape(and even then i've seen some very brave women carry to term and put the baby up for adoption but i still understand a woman not wanting to carry a reminder of a horrible thing that happened to them). <br>  <br>  I'm pro choice and realize that people make mistakes but when you hear about women on their 3rd and 4th abortion just cuz their lazy a s s e s can't take a little pill everyday or stop spreading their legs, it makes me pretty mad.|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	It up to the individual if they want an abortion or not and nothing to do with us, it could be for ill heath, rape, a deformity detected in the fetus.

They are woefully underqualified to have an opinion or a say about it. An abortion is a solution not taken lightly by most women but it is their decision and nobody elses business. I am glad personally that the choice is there in case it is needed for whatever reason. It should be done sooner rather than later and should be followed up by a counseling session in my opinion. Abortion will always be with us unfortunately and thank goodness it can be accessed these days in clean and professional places by caring people and not in back yards by hacks as it used to be done. Other people are entitled to their opinions...if you don't like abortion then don't have one...but they are NOT entitled to force their opinions on others.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	i personally dont agree with it, but i believe its each individuals choice|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I think abortion is necessary for some women after rape etc.  But personally I don't agree with it and would never have one myself, unless under extreme circumstances.  I consider the baby has a soul the instant it is conceived.  Adoption is another option to consider but would be hard on the mother.  I think women who have abortions never really get over it to be honest.  They always will feel like something is missing, or feel guilty about it.  I think it's only for extreme cases where women have been raped etc.  Hope this helps.|`|v3IobQCgaa	I'm a tremendous fan of birth control.  If more people were a tremendous fan of birth control, abortion would be somewhat of a non-issue.  <br>  I'm for abortion in cases of rape and during the 2% instances when the birth control doesn't work... and even then it can be debateable.  <br>  But in basic cases of "oops we forgot the condom".... they need to take responsibility.|`|DhmUgq0maa	I am pro choice, I believe every woman has different circumstances...I don't believe that abortion should be used as a form of contraception because stupid idiots don't use condoms and the pill.<br>  <br>  But i believe if you were taking precautions and still fell pregnant and you know mentally, physically & financially that you couldn't afford another child then It is their choice to have an abortion.<br>  <br>  I have 3 kids and know that if i ever fell pregnant again i wouldn't be able to have another baby, I'd have an abortion BUT it will never come to that as i take precautions.|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	Just ask this question in the 'search for questions' tool bar of this site and you will find people have asked this question thousands of times and the same answers are always given.

However, I think these people that keep needing to have them should be sterilised after a few times because that's just careless and is needlessly throwing life away.  Fair enough if it's a one off accident, these things happen, but how difficult is it to just use a condom or go on the pill?|`|e44b7050fb792247b231f218559774e8aa	Nothing is wrong with abortion. I think it should be used as many times as needed for any reason. No one should feel guilty about it. The only reason people do feel guilty about it is the sick crazy nut job so called "lifers".

08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	Ignore "loves christmas lights", they have no idea what they are talking about! OF COURSE it's your job to be concerned about this kind of thing, as someone working in early years childcare it would be irresponsible for you NOT to take an interest in the development of children in your care. Of course, you can't tell people how to parent, but it doesn't sound like this is the issue here, since his sister seems fine and you haven't mentioned anything that suggests his parents are abusive or incompetent.<br>  <br>  It may well be that he is just slow and will catch up eventually, but you are right to think you should speak to your supervisor, since any child who is not developing normally should be checked out to ensure there isn't a more serious problem. If it is a disorder like autism or ADHD then getting him help early on will make a huge difference & will reduce the problems he'll experience later. It's much better to know what the problem is so that you can devise ways to help him. It could be nothing major, or something to do with being bilingual (although most bilingual kids have no problems adjusting), but it's better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  Please, trust your instincts and talk to your supervisor! As a professional with experience of normal child development, you are best placed to tell when a child isn't developing in the expected way.|`|IdHS0P2vaa	Hi from what you have said it sounds like this child could be on the autistic spectrum.I have an autistic daughter who is five.people who don't know much about  this condition think there all the same.Does he play with other children?good eye contact?does he flap his hands or rock back and forth.|`|FAkkLDxjaa	It's hard to be working with a child that you know may have a few delays. Especially in a day care situation. You just can't go out and say to the parents that you have a concern. Dealing with them and their behavior is the main thing. Play-doh is great for those anxiety moments. I am not sure if you are having behavioral problems out of him or not. Try asking the parents if they have any concerns about the child. If they do, then maybe they will own up to the fact that there may be a problem. He does need speech therapy, but that is for the parents to decide. Just keep working with him on functioning day to day and hopefully everything else will fall in line. Go ahead and ask your supervisor, just to see IF there can be anything done on the Centers point of view. Good Luck and keep in touch.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Since you are not a trained person to do diagnosises, first off boys are slower to develop than girls, since you mentioned ethnicity might come into play, who are you to tell their parents how to parent??? You really dont have the right or should you even want to discuss this with the parents. I think paying more attention to do what you are paid to do is more worth your time and worry. Its while they are at day care thier exposure to others, new languages and situations they also develope and since maybe at home no english might not be spoken, oh well, its how their lives are ok. Dont worry there is nothing wrong with what is going on here.  I say this as my own grandson behaves way younger than the kids in his day care, its how kids are brought up, my daughter wont disaplin as much as she should and allows him to misbehanve, it makes it very hard for his day care to deal with, and any suggestions to anyone, well each mom has thier own way and shes not afraid to let anyone who comments know this. So at this young age, he seems to be doing what he should possibly the language if you spoke arabic you may see an entirely different child, why not learn some of his language, simple words, toy, eat, apple, toy, sit, laugh, those kinds of words and see how he reacts, he may turn around and how how he can be, right now, hes in a place he cant even understand whats being said to him. Your kind to be concerned, educate yourself more to assist, and I think you will be more at ease on the situtaion. We cant tell people how to parent, and if there are medical problems, the parents may already know, and not appriciate you discussing thier child.|`|BtxQogSzaa	Have you researched Autism? <br>  It is a large spectrum...and these little key factors just ring alarm bells towards Autism.<br>  Im no doctor, so don't take my work for it, but we did have a boy like that in our day care, he was 3 tho, and all he would do is grunt...he was very clever but just couldn't talk...his parents were in denyl and it didn't help the child. but thats always what i though he had.<br>  Anyhow good luck with it.|`|axWE0Ag3aa	My cousin is the same way (same age) and he was diagnosed with ADHD and OCD. Either might be a possible issue in this case.|`|H9RTbhKYaa	I was developmentally delayed (due to an abusive situation) when I was his age. Now, I'm more intelligent, motivated, and friendly than most of the other people I know. Just love and support him and he will turn out better than all the other kids. Also, don't drug him up. Let him learn from his mistakes. Drugs don't solve problems (I stopped taking meds because I wanted to die and within weeks, my popularity went up and I snapped out of my major depression). I also recommend that you feed him a healthy diet and provide him with PLENTY of exercise.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	The areas of concern that are jumping out to me are the lack of speech and the delayed physical development. Is he actually walking? What is his co-ordination like? Can he throw/attempt to catch a ball? etc. You also mentioned that he is bi-lingual. Bi-lingual children are usually more advanced than their peers. If there is minimal speech at home as well (Be it in Arabic or English) than I would think that is of significance. He's 4 months of three so should have an extensive vocabulary and be speaking in 3 and 4 word sentences. Most of what he says should be understood. I agree that you should talk to the supervisor about this. Hopefully it is nothing more than developmental delays which can be addressed by a speech pathologist and physiotherapist.

heoBp6Taaa	Depends on whether your single, partnered and how much your partner earns, we're very lucky in Australia the government will give us enough to manage. My husband and I with 1 child get by on about $500 per week it's not easy and we are on a tight budget. We don't go out much haven't had a holiday for ages and live on mince and chicken no lobster or eye fillet steak for us.

Good luck.|`|Q32qXErCaa	May be you should plan to have a baby properly----if you cant afford it -try contraception!!!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	This has been asked a lot before:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071101054044AAVdgBG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090102182213AAklRL2">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  I'm sure if you search you'll find more. It mostly seems to depend on how much stuff you want to buy (some stuff isn't strictly necessary) and whether you go for second hand/generic brands or more expensive stuff. There's initial stuff like car seat and then ongoing stuff like clothes and nappies. Baby bonus doesn't cover everything but it would help. I think it's $380 a fortnight now but you can check on the Centrelink web site you can find out about that and also stuff like Family Tax Benefit and child care. Breast feeding is much cheaper than formula too!<br>  <br>  Babies are a lot cheaper than older kids!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|MmGTFuoTaa	No one can tell you how much it costs to have a baby AND you are not having a baby, you are having a child. In all honest i dont know where people get off saying babies are expensive because they are not!! Especially for people in Australia who get the baby bonus, i did. It covers all the costs of getting started and if you spend wisely, shop around and ask mothers with numerous children what the 'real' necessities are then you will have some spare. If you breastfeed your only ongoing costs to start with is clothes, which if bought sensibly are fairly resonable and nappies and wipes. Not alot else. The other things such as lotions etc are pocket change. The government is there to assist you if you are both dual income earners but fall within the low income bracket or if you are a single income family. I think its when the kiddies get a bit older it gets ALOT more expensive!!!! Go to the centrelink website if you want to check out how much you will recieve it is all on there in black and white easy to understand text. That being said if you have a large morgage then you are in a different situation. You may have to return to work to keep your higher income and may find this a strain paying for childcare. But you do get half of what you pay in childcare benefits returned at the end of the financial year!! <br>  <br>  Goodluck!!! Whenever you decide to expand your family!
AA11630994	Flossy! I could have been asking this myself, im exactly in your boat, and my GP was no help.<br>  <br>  I found this great book from the Library - Planning a baby? by Sarah Brewer. It will tell you everything you need to know, im loving the book. It has also helped me choose the right foods for myself. It tells you what cheeses are bad, what vitamins, what veg... it also gives you an explanantion of why you need to have what.<br>  <br>  Firstly, i have started taking folic acid tablets, i have started walking for 10min everyday, but you have to try  (walking, swimming, cycling) atleast for 20 min a day. Have alot of Green veg (kale, brocoli, cabbage). Start having fruit and herbal teas, Limit coffee to one cup a day. <br>  <br>  Infact you will realize that this is the time you make changes to your lifestyle health wise to get your body ready, as the first 4 weeks of pregnancy - when you wont even know you're pregnant - is the most crucial time of your babies growth. <br>  <br>  I hope you do find that book, because since i found it, im more calmer and it has put my mind off constantly thinking - i want to concieve now. Im just as excited as you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Walking is the best form of exercise.  Pilates is also good.  Start this before you conceive and then once you get the positive test, lay off it until week 16 of your pregnancy.  You can then get back into it again at week 16 until you are due.  Then six weeks after the birth you can get back into it again.  It tones your core abs and helps you to carry the baby easier and helps with backache.  I can highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  As for diet.  Eat lots of foods high in folic acid as well as taking suppliments.  Green leafy veges are good for folic acid and there are other foods as well.  Cut back on lots of sugar and junk food and just eat really well - a good mix of whole grain breads and cereals, fruits and veges and low fat meats and fish.  You can't go wrong eating like this.<br>  <br>  Also I would cut out caffeine (coffee, tea and chocolate) and also alcohol completely.  Drink lots of water instead.<br>  <br>  It really does make a difference to your pregnancy if you do these things and you will enjoy it more, be less bloated and big and the birth and recover could even be easier.|`|H93JbQS0aa	Well you sure need to reduce a lot more weight its not healthy for your body, make sure you stick to drinking plenty fluids, fresh veggies and fruites.

It sounds like you are on the right track, eat well and exercise.  Do you're best to avoid overly processed foods.  Once you are pregnant, you should avoid alcohol of course and fish that contain high levels of mercury.  The Dr may put you on a multivitamin with folic acid.  Any exercise is fine, assuming you are not a competitive boxer :-)<br>  <br>  There are a lot of great 'what to expect' books, check them out.<br>  <br>  I will also give you two pieces of other unsolicited advice.  Remember what its like to be a couple now, because you'll forget that.  Having a baby is an amazing experience, the best of my life, but enjoy yourself now too.  The birth will be fine, but its impossible to prepare or plan for it, so take it as it comes and relish the experience.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well for you!|`|yQ7Nk4yWaa	exercise regularly|`|DYKYImD0aa	It's great that you are preparing in advance - remeber that it takes 3 months for sperm to form, so get your other half to be as healthy as possible at least 3 months is advance too (reduce alcohol and caffeine, loose underwear etc). Most important vitamins for men are Zinc, Vitamen E and Folic Acid (blokes need it too).<br>  <br>  For you:<br>  - Take a prenatal supplement containing folic acid. <br>  - Start monitoring your cycles now so that you can no if anything isn't in working order- use websited liek go28days.com or fertlityfriends.co.uk.<br>  - Reduce your caffeinde and alcohol intake<br>  - Green tea/Rooibos tea are great anti-oxidants<br>  - Red Raspberry leaf tea can help prepare and strengthen your uterus<br>  - Evening Primrose Oil is good to help with your ovulation<br>  - Avoid refined sugars and starches<br>  - Make sure you get enough iron in your diet<br>  <br>  Basically have a healthy balance in your life and learn to deal with stress now! Once you have kids you'll have little chance to learn how to do it. <br>  I can really recommend the Zita West 'Plan to get Pregnant' book.<br>  Good luck!<br>  xxx|`|ldyKSejgaa	Getting fit before you get pregnant can boost your overall health and wellness but also promote your fertility. It is important that you begin a regular exercise plan even if you haven't been active in the past. Any time is a good time to start a fitness program. If you do plan on conceiving, be sure to consult with your doctor prior to starting an exercise program. Your health care provider can offer sound advice about exercise options and nutritional recommendations during conception.<br>  <br>  How Is Exercise Important for Pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Exercise is important for you and your baby. Exercise will allow you to maintain a healthy weight or promote weight loss if you are overweight. This can increase the chances you will conceive. It is important however that you eat healthily and avoid over dieting when trying to conceive, as this can have negative effects on your fertility.<br>  <br>  Many women also find that exercise helps them relax and sleep more soundly, also vital for promoting fertility and well being. Exercise also helps prepare your body for pregnancy, labor and birth. It takes a lot of work to grow a baby. If you haven't exercised before you should consider starting an exercise program to help your body prepare for pregnancy and delivery. Many studies suggest that routine exercise promotes a safer and easier labor for women at the end of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  What Types of Exercise Should I Consider?<br>  <br>  If you plan to become pregnant or are pregnant, walking is an ideal exercise to start with. You can try walking 20 minutes each day, working your way up to ? hour or more. Walk briskly to get your heart bumping and the blood circulating through your body.<br>  <br>  Once you have mastered daily walking you can try other activities including swimming or yoga. Each of these exercises are optimal for improving lung and heart function. Swimming also works each of the muscles in your body and is an ideal form of exercise during pregnancy, helping ease the pain and stiffness or machines that may result in your back and legs from carrying around a baby.<br>  <br>  Some women find stationary cycling is an ideal form of exercise both before and during pregnancy. You should never ride a mobile bicycle after pregnancy as you risk falling and injuring your abdomen.<br>  <br>  Some women enjoy taking a prenatal aerobics or other fitness class. You can take this even if you are planning to be pregnant. Taking a class early will help you get accustomed to the routine and help you feel more comfortable exercising when you do become pregnant. You may also find you learn valuable pointers from other women when taking a prenatal fitness class. There are also many prenatal exercise videos available on the web. If you aren't comfortable trying a class, consider a video first in your home. This will get you accustomed to a routine of daily exercise.<br>  Nutrition and Exercise<br>  <br>  Nutrition is also an important component of getting fit before pregnancy. You have to eat well in addition to exercising to boost your fertility and improve the odds you will have a healthy baby.<br>  <br>  You might consider chatting with your health care provider about your weight, diet and fertility. Your doctor may advise you to lose weight, maintain your weight or even gain weight depending on your current health status. Your health care provider will also likely recommend you start taking a prenatal vitamin to ensure your body has the vitamins and minerals it needs to grow a healthy baby and prevent birth defects.<br>  <br>  If you have problems maintaining or following a healthy diet, your health care provider may recommend you seek the advice of a dietician, who can help you develop a healthy nutritional program for your pregnancy and beyond. Remember a healthy lifestyle before pregnancy will help ensure you are able to carry your pregnancy safely to term and enjoy the period after.

My mom won't leave me alone and it is the most stressful thing in the world. <br>  Stop badgering him and let him find his way on his own. He will find out who he is, especially in high school. There are a lot of different people and things to choose from. He'll figure it out and he can do it on his own. <br>  Being in high school is tough.

I went through a really bad phase where I just didn't want to leave the house at all and I avoided school for about 6 weeks. In hind sight many people do believe that I actually had mild depression. <br>  What actually got me out of that mindset was my friend. She, almost out of the blue, started ringing me, demanding that I show up to school and would come call for me in the morning. Once I was back, it took a while to get into the flow of things, but having support from friends and teachers was a lot more helpful than my family who at the time thought I was getting bullied and demanded that I explain what was wrong with me. <br>  I'm not saying don't talk to your kid, I think it's great that you are concerned, but maybe try to find something that interests him without putting any pressure on him?... Ask him for help around the house or with stuff to do outside the home?<br>  and definitely explain your concerns to him. and if things don't improve, then start getting firm... overall, it took me about 3 months to get out of my phase, and quite frankly, it's still the running joke in the family, (that i was single-handedly bringing the school's attendance down)<br>  <br>  take care
AA11630994	Hi Kaz...i have been reading alot about this as im going through a pre pregnancy time, and if you only starteds a few months ago, it says theres nothing to worry, you just have to keep trying, if a year goes by then perhaps you might want to meet a midwife/gp, but for now like my irritating GP says - just go home and enjoy yourself till it happens.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hiya hunni,<br>  <br>  sorry af came, my fiance and i have been ttc for 15 months now (almost) and i cant tell u how quick its gone.<br>  <br>  first thing i would do is get some opks, they are so quick and easy to use and so much easier than bbt xxx<br>  <br>  also get ur hubby tested, its so much easier to test a man and so much easier to treat.<br>  <br>  my fuiance was tested and the results were very poor, but at least we now know where we stand, i have been having tests in the meantime (so far so good) and billy is due for another analysis next month then we have to see what happens.<br>  <br>  other tips:<br>  <br>  pree-seed- its a lube that mimics ewcm and gives the optimum conditions for sperm<br>  <br>  prob ur hips up after sex to allow gravity to help (not always flattering though lol)<br>  <br>  final tip.....use yahoo lol, i have found out soooo much here xxxx<br>  <br>  best wishes hunni xxxx<br>  <br>  oh and monitor ur periods exactly so u know when ur late or if (like me) u r slighty irregualr as this can make a big difference to ttc xxxxx<br>  <br>  if u need any thing just give me a shout and good luck xxxx|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	You have a fairly long cycle so probably ovulate way after day 14 of your cycle.  (I'm a day 18 girl!!).  My best advice to you is to try every second day after your period, but make it fun, not mechanical.  Spice things up a bit, rather than say to your husband, "It's time again!"  Going on holiday can help - as you relax and sex is more fun etc.<br>  <br>  If you have been trying for a year without success then you need to go to a doctor, but not before.  Apparently you only have a 20-25% chance of getting pregnant each month and normal couples can take from 6-12 months to get pregnant.  In saying that, some get pregnant in one month!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DYKYImD0aa	Hi hun,<br>  There's alot of us out there who know what you are going through (I've been ttc 12 months now) - it is very sad when AF comes along every month. Get yourself on a website that can help you chartyour cycles. I use go28days.com or fertilityfriends.co.uk. On there you can chart symptoms, temps (but I don't bother with that) and various other things. Ovulation is usually 14 days before your AF arrives, but if you are irregular it's hard to tell. You can also try using Ovulation predictor Kits which you buy from a chemist - but you need to know more or less when you think you are ovulating in your cycle. That is why charting is important.<br>  Google 'chart cycle' and 'cm ovulation' for some more info. Once you get charting you'll know when the important time is to do the deed.<br>  Best of luck!<br>  xxx|`|jICLEl86aa	hi im told by my fertility spec, sex every 3days and for u i wud start around your 10th day and just keep it going, gd luck
zK1V9Mu7aa	You are most likely in the VERY early stages of labour. When your contractions get to 4-5 minutes apart and are lasting 1minute that is the time to get to hospital and phone your midwife. Also, if and when your waters break you will need to go to hospital. Could be a while yet so put your feet up and relax.<br>  Even though labour could be near form the symptoms you are describing labour could be a week away. It really depends on how fast your body labours. I was having what you are describing, but my contractions were every 15 mins for 3days before I went in to actual labour.<br>  Hope it isn't too long! x|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	It really sounds that way.<br>  I felt like I needed the toilet a lot, then was concerned that I had piles, my waters did not break then got lots of pains, I don't think you are being a drama queen, I actually believe you are in the latter stages of labour if pains are 3 minutes apart.<br>  <br>  My water didn't come out at all, nor did a show, they had to burst the sac of membranes to get my son out.  If you go to the hospital, the worst they will do is send you home, but you can ask them for decent pain relief too.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it sounds like baby is on his/her way.<br>  xx<br>  <br>  EDIT: I do apologise, I misread your question as every 3 minutes as apposed to lasting 3 minutes, wondered why everyone was being so mean as to tell you to hang on!  Sorry.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	sounds like it's the start of labor coming...but you aren't quite there yet. but yes, you are almost there sweetie.good luck. do not to go the hospital now... you'll only be sent home. Once there are every 3-5 minutes  or you break your water then you can go.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	It sounds like you have a long way to go yet if the contractions are every hour and a half. My advice would be to go about your daily business.  Go for a short walk down your street etc.  Or if it is nighttime, try and sleep.  If it's your first child then you could have a long way to go yet and it is best to rest.  This is a very exciting time, but you have to calm down and rest.  Wait until the contractions are exactly 5 minutes apart before going to hospital, otherwise they may send you home.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you'll see your baby soon.|`|heoBp6Taaa	Yes sounds very much like labor, like every one is saying though you really do need to wait until the contractions are at least 5 mins apart before going to hospital. It's much more comfortable at home than in a dingy room or ward at the hospital.. Remember if this is your first baby you could have another 7-8 hours of this as you wait for the contractions to get closer and regular.<br>  <br>  Best of luck for a safe and easy delivery.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	call the ambulance soon you are in labour. God be with you.|`|BU3A3rR4aa	yeah u culd be in early labor....|`|h9y1IZA2aa	yes it sounds like labour but the contractions are too far apart at the moment, if you went to the hospital they would just send you home again untill your contractions are closer together, so have a bath and eat a bowl of cornflakes to fill you up and give you some energy and just relax, when the contractions are about 3-5 mins apart then start making your way to hospital.<br>  Good luck.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	When are you due? <br>  <br>  Try to relax, if you are due now or now abouts it could indeed be early labour.  Take a couple of paracetamol, drink lots of water and try a warm bath, take a nap if you can (once you are out of the bath!!) get as much rest as possible!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|MW3Br5V8aa	i had no show or waters breaking... i'd get to hospital.. and be a drama queen lap it up its the only chance we women get!! lol|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	Call your doctor! It could be false labor but he should tell you whether to wait or go to the hospital!<br>  GOOD LUCK & CONGRATS!|`|ir0qEV3waa	my friend was in the same situation and the woman at the hospital said if you get these pains 2mins apart go to hospital how far gone are u! xxx good luck|`|hlWdFTcjaa	Contact your midwife or hospital, see what they advise you to do.

Good luck sweet!   :-)|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	go to the hospital girl! you dont want to have the baby at home do you|`|98vMUckbaa	you are certainly in the very early stages of labor and either your water isn't ready to break or it will need to be broken like mine was. i would wait til the contractions are 3-4 mins apart then go to the hospital. good luck.
YzUPmWTBaa	Yes it can. I didnt know I was pregnant until almost 3months, because I had very light bleeding every month, the same time my period was due. So I just assumed it was it. Why dont you go to the doc and get a blood test? Then you can be 100% sure.|`|MW3Br5V8aa	go see ur doctor asap.. :)<br>  <br>  hope alls ok..

If he loved you, why is he with another for 2-3 days at a time? Honey, you're letting this man have his cake and eat it too.

He's going to run away from his responsibility then he may be with you as you want him because he's not going to have any baggage with you, that is, til he also makes you pregnant. You are wasting your time with this guy. A good man is what you need most. Not a fly by night. This is not love. This is a time bomb. The only thing you may get out of all this is stds or aids.

Personally, I'd avoid this situation like the plague, but who knows?  Life comes into the world in the most amazing of ways.<br>  <br>  And I will say this: You have honesty going for you.  Many couples do exactly what you describe but they try to keep it a big secret from each other and their community.  Sounds to me like you might actually be more advanced than most, but still. . .  It also sounds like a very difficult road, and if it doesn't work out, then you'll be a single mom and if Mister Right comes along, then you'll not be able to start a family from scratch with him.<br>  <br>  But like I said. . .  There are no rules and everybody is different.

Aside from the fact that that is completely messed up, what kind of example are you setting? Not to mention, having a baby is a huge commitment and you need your partner there 100%..not 50%.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, it might be hindering your chances since he is giving half his sperm to someone else..|`|0MUvGlHkaa	my GOD i nearly wet myself on that he is no man and yr no woman letting the cat stray and let alone have a child i feel sorry for the thought|`|ymE0B4ymaa	You actually are asking this??

I was fortunate enough to not have so much debt that our survival depended on me working all the time (it made it easier, but not absolutely necessary), so after they started school I would sometimes work during the school year and take a leave during the summer months and go back when school started again. I did that until the youngest was in jr. high, then I started working year round.|`|DhmUgq0maa	I'm still at home with mine...

TFIXPiPdaa	uhmm, the difference is the way the child portrays hims self.  when a child is around his mother until he is 10  then he Will not care what anyone else but his mother thinks, so he will dress odd and peculiar.  if he is introduced to others grandparent's sibling's the child will be introduced to responsibility and will feel the need to better themselves and portray their image in a more positive way.  hope i helped a little. 10 pts please?|`|iMULlxdgaa	I think closer realtionship with those who took care of him/her more.  My son is with me/my husband most of the time, I don't mins sending him to play at a firends house every once in a while, I have friends that will watch my son if needed, my parents live about an hour away from me so every once in awhile they'll see him but its not all the time.  However, on the flip side my son has a friend at his daycare that her grandmother always picks her up takes her to b-day parties and I think she is closer to her grandmom than her real mother.  My sister is  ayoung mom and she is busy finishing up school and she lives closer to my parents so her kids stay with my aprents a lot and my parents and my sister say that the kids like it better at grandmom's house too... I guess this would be the only difference.  Kids will feel more attached to their primary caregivers. Not really a problem, unless your the mom or dad, it would personally make me feel bad if my son was more attached to someone else.  But that's just me...|`|90geB0aKaa	Feel with mom and smb.because no one no give a love and look after good than mom.<br>  one case.<br>  I no live and mom  in about time i am child i cannot love mom because my grand mother lookafter me instead mom. i love grandmother instead my mom.<br>  I think if give a time 1or 3 hour per day for talk or to give toy or other or poem or play and child or book for child good for child. because if child like some in that child can make the something in thjey when child grow up such as like read book will be writer in future. <br>  i think.hehe up on you .
25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	You and your baby are the most important things in your life right now, so it might be wise to let your brother handle the family issues and leave you out of it for a while. Even after your child is born, the stress you feel as a result of this issue is likely to be transferred to your child. So, depending on how important it is, you might just want to let it slide for a while longer.|`|0MUvGlHkaa	i wld leave it alone till yr baby is born if yr stressed and very angry blood pressure will be high and it can lead you into early labour and many other complications so rest

My son only weighed 7lbs 9oz, 2nd time it was about 3 1/2 stone and my daughter weighed 7lbs. This time I've put ononly 5 1/2lbs and I'm 28 weeks so its looking better! If you are eating too much then you need to reduce it but I honestly ate my normal diet the previous 2 pregnancies however this time I've lost my appetite, had alot of stress and a family bereavement.|`|NpFmdjlvaa	i put on 4 stone with my first pregnancy!! <br>  and only lost 2 stone when i had him!! <br>  <br>  but this is my 2nd one and i started off being 11stone 11lbs and i now weigh 13 stone exactly so havent hardly put a lot on hopefully it will stay that way lol|`|gdnL63ngaa	I'm currently 21.5 weeks and have gained about 14lbs.

59GymH27aa	My daughter doesn't like plain milk either.  So we use the Nestle powder to make it taste chocolate, strawberry or banana.  So she is still getting the nurtients out of the milk.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Just as nutritious as white milk <br>  Similar to how it’s made at home, store-bought chocolate milk is made by adding cocoa powder and a small amount of sugar to white milk. Pure and simple! The sugar amount, for the home made version, varies according to your preference. Some dairies may add small amounts of other natural ingredients or flavourings to enhance the taste or texture.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Great for kids…and adults too!<br>  A boost for kids’ nutrition<br>  Research shows kids who drink chocolate or other flavoured milk drink fewer soft drinks and fruit-flavoured drinks than kids who don't. As a result, they have higher intakes of calcium and phosphorus – two key bone-building nutrients.<br>  <br>  Milk is Milk however he will drink it is good.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	It depends on the type of chocolate milk.<br>  If your son is having a small carton (300ml) of Chocolate milk from the supermarket, that contains 6.5 teaspoons of sugar plus artificial colours and flavours. If you're making it yourself, it depends on what chocolate powdered drink or flavouring you are using. If you are making it yourself, purchase a chocolate powder that has the least amount of sugar and that is the most "natural" and add half the amount of chocolate it recommends. That way he's still getting the calcium & minerals from the milk without all of the sugar.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Chocolate milk is a Godsend for me. My daughter stopped drinking regular milk about a month ago. She will drink Chocolate milk though. Chocolate milk has all the same nutrients as regular milk, so it's just the added sugar you need to worry about. <br>  <br>  So if you want, you can cut the sugar from one of his daily treats, or make sure the juice he's drinking is either watered down, or is pure fruit juice, something that doesn't have as much sugar in it.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	It depends on his age...<br>  <br>  If Johnny is under age two, he needs to during at least 16 ounces of WHOLE milk each day. If the ONLY way you can get him to drink it is by putting chocolate in it, then that is preferable to no milk at all. But I would avoid it if at all possible. And, stop buying juice. No juice in the house, then he can't drink it...problem solved. If he gets thirsty, he will drink water or milk.<br>  <br>  If he is over age two, don't worry about the milk so much, as long as he is getting calcium and Vit. D other places. So, no choc milk...too much sugar, which he is already getting from the juice.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Why would chocolate milk be bad? Is it the sugar you're concerned about?<br>  <br>  Chocolate is the only way my kids and I drink milk. We drink it twice a day, and it hasn't fattened us up or made us hyper. It's good for the bones; most kids don't get enough calcium. If you're worried about too much sugar or high fructose corn syrup, use Quik powder mix; no syrup, and you can control how much you put in. Use skim milk if you're worried about it being too fattening.<br>  <br>  I would say chocolate milk prepared this way is better for him than sugary juices, esp. apple juice.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	my kids didnt really drink plain milk either,,,they both loved strawberry milk (prolly my fault as i craved it while pregnant).  they drank strawberry milk all the time,,,along with cheese, yogurt, ice cream, etc  they got plenty of calcium and vit D.  our dr never had a problem, they also drank juice, water, gatorade, etc.  it is all about moderation.  a balanced diet.  my "babies" are now 11 (yes twins) and they are happy, healthy, intelligent, normal kids. <br>  once a day,,,i dont see a problem with it,,,have you looked at ovaltine,,,it has added vitamins and minerals in it|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i do it sometimes, my daughter hates plain milk, but i suggest getting the chocolate syrup or powder yourself and mixing it in so you can control how much sugar you are adding, those already made store jugs are really really thick and sweet. Whole foods and Trader Joes both sell an organic lower sugar chocolate syrup that she loves.  good luck|`|AA11109728	It's not bad, but I'd limit it.  Like you said, if that's the only way he will drink milk, let him have chocolate milk, but only one cup.  My daughter has always been great with drinking milk, juice, and water, so I usually will let her have chocolate milk once in awhile if she wants because she already drinks plenty of regular milk.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	Not a dumb Q at all.<br>  <br>  Honestly, If my toddler just would NOT drink milk, I'd probably try a pinch (and I mean a smaall pinch) of ovaltine. Not enough to make chocolatey chocolate milk, just to mix it up and give him (or so he thinks) 'what he wants'. Then over time, wean him off it. At least ovaltine has nutrients of some sort in it as opposed to hershey's syrup etc.<br>  <br>  I'd also try *fortified* soy milk before that, though. That's what my oldest drank for years.<br>  <br>  But then, I'm a bit of a renegade parent...|`|WirFwirLaa	My mom decided 2 weeks ago when my 13 mo. old spent the weekend at her house that he should try not only chocolate but strawberry milk. He liked the strawberry but not so much chocolate..which i'm not complaining....I talked to my friend who is a peds. nurse and asked her if it was okay to let him drink flavored milk and she said it was fine in moderation!|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Chocolate milk if he wont drink regular milk is ok just dont make it as rich as you would say for a treat. If all else fails you could ask if Pediasure is an option too as it has good amounts of Calcium in it and its what my youngest drank for a couple of yrs til she started drinking milk again now we go thru 2 gallons a week...lol|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Hi It really depends on what kind(.Cheek the back) for nutrtion facts.It is actully recomded for those kids  who do not drink white milk do add flavering.It can be just as good for him as white milk.If you have any questions on which is healther feel free to email me from my profile.A lot of parents come in to the hospital I work at with the same concern.|`|MI53mUKzaa	my doctor said that if he will drink chocolate milk give it to him.  but then slowly wean him off of it by adding less and less chocolate and over time he will like plain milk.  i have a son that only drinks plain milk.|`|RyYWzEZcaa	I read somewhere that the sugar in the chocolate milk is worth it just to get them to drink milk.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I drink like oh 2 litres of chocolate milk a day.<br>  <br>  I am doing just fine. It's so yummy|`|CrZxYK5raa	i would give him sugar free chocolate milk it only has like 15 calories per serving and you just add it to the milk. it tastes the same and its better for them. I would give it to him he needs to drink  milk because he is so young. kids go threw weird things.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Wow, our boys have a lot in common, lol.<br>  <br>  I've been fighting the cha-cha milk battle with my husband.  He gives it to Connor so much that he doesn't want to drink white milk.  I've finally gotten him to understand my side on this battle and we're down to once a day.  I'm happy with that.  I know it's not ideal but that's how often he gets it for now.<br>  <br>  I've been trying to be more careful this time around, only b/c Aidan will (still) only drink 'pink milk'.<br>  <br>  ETA:  I might have already told you this?.... "Cha-cha" was Connor's 5th word.  The first time he said it was after Louie gave him a cup of (white) milk.  He didn't want it so he threw it and said "cha-cha".  I knew at that moment we had a problem, lol.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Dylan is totally my child because he LOVES chocolate milk. I stopped buying the regular chocolate syrup and went to Carnation Instant Breakfast because I figured it was at least a bit healthier. And now I've switched to Ovaltine so he's at least getting some nutrients. And if sugar free is available, I grab it!<br>  <br>  I'm lucky enough that Dylan does drink regular milk as well as water and juice. But I still give it to him once in a while, some days more frequent than others. <br>  <br>  I personally think that chocolate milk isn't as bad as some other things he could be into. And if you do things in moderation, it's not as bad. But I would also try to avoid sugar by buying sugar free and also looking at the nutrients to see what has the most. <br>  <br>  And nope, not a dumb question at all. :)|`|j2mRop0laa	When my daughter was 3 all she drank was like 8 glasses of strawberry milk a day. She wouldn't even eat really. Her doctor told me to give her as much as she wanted because it was as good as a meal and as long as I wasn't emptying the strawberry syrup in it, she wasn't getting too much sugar.<br>  She lived off the stuff. So a glass a day would definitely be fine. :)|`|TQW5E6olaa	You know, if that's the only way to get him to drink milk, I don't see any harm in it once a day, I would just lessen the chocolate over time so he isn't getting too much sugar and watch the other sugary things he eats during the day.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'd say it's fine as a treat - but having it every day is a lot more than just a treat. Once or twice a week, maybe.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I always have. Neither of my kids have cavity's or weight issues. Everything in moderation.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	no.  my daughter would not drink white milk at all.  the only way she would take it was as chocolate milk.  it wasn't until she was maybe 1 and a 1/2 that i was able to get her to drink white milk.  i had to wean her off it.  lol<br>  regardless, if you are happy and he is - go for it.  a little chocolate milk never hurt anyone.  thats the only way my mom will drink it!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	My little SIL would ONLY drink Strawberry milk. Couldn't get her to drink plain milk to save her life!<br>  <br>  I think it's fine becasuse he'll still receive the benefits of the milk. Maybe use Ovaltine instead of Hershey's or Nestle's. Ovaltine is supposed to be rich in vitamins & nutrients and it DOES taste good!|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	it is ok to give them some but take away sweets for 2 days <br>  and if he gets hyper take it away for 6 month<br>  also whatch out for tummy aches dirrea and vomit<br>  <br>  it could be that he is allerchic to it|`|A7SJT50Kaa	i hope not...i give my dd chocolate flavored almond milk!

a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	My 9 month old sleeps from 9pm-7am so 10 hours a night. It sounds normal that your little one is sleeping 9 hours. When my son was around 6 months his schedule was just like your sons. It was exhausting getting up that early! I let him go to bed when he wants though. If he isnt tired at 9 then I dont force him to bed, and if he wants to go to bed at 8 I let him. I just follow his lead. He eats 2 solid meals a day, 2 snacks and has bottles of formula in between. The day light saving messed me up since we lost an hour when he was getting up early, looks like you will have the opposite problem. Lucky!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	My son is also 9 months and usually goes to bed by 10 pm. He wakes anywhere between 6:30-8:00 am. Sometimes he wakes at around 5 am for a small feeding and goes back to sleep though. I consider it sleeping through the night, since it's usually an 8 hour stretch at least.|`|Yyqhbyoiaa	My daughter is just over 1 now but when she was 9 months she would go to bed at 9pm and wake at 8:30-9am.<br>  Same with my first daughter.<br>  They were doing that from 6 weeks but they are all the same as my 12 week old son has his last feed at 9:30pm and wakes for a feed at 5:30-6:30am and then sometimes back to bed till 9am.<br>  What your son is doing is great, keep it up :)|`|y6g0RnuAaa	That sounds right to me. My son was on that schedule from 6 months until recently. Now at 10 1/2 months he started sleeping until just before 7 am. YAY!<br>  It makes sense that daylight savings will help him sleep later- maybe he will even keep his same bedtime too.|`|mCbe2a67aa	My little boy is 9 months old and he usually sleeps between 10-11 hours a night. He's goes to sleep around 8:15-8:30 (I feel you on the not going to bed earlier thing) and usually wakes anywhere between 6:30-7:30 for the day. If he wakes at 6:30 I usually give him a paci to see if he'll fall back to sleep for a little bit. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. He gave up his night feedings around 6 months old. I think for a 9 month old sleeping through the night is considered the entire night, like not waking up at all for a feeding, so between 10-12 hours. <br>  <br>  Mine also eats quite a bit during the day and his dinner isn't until 6, with a nursing at 7, and then some bananas right before his bath, which is right before bed, so he eats later than yours and more than yours it seems like, so that could be a factor. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :-)|`|Iu0AJDviaa	He should be sleeping all night by now,but as the old saying goes-every baby is different.<br>  <br>  My 5th baby slept through from birth and my 3rd baby never slept 3 hours and she still doesnt sleep properly.<br>  <br>  My last baby who is almost 4mths has been sleeping through(10-12 hours) since she was 2mths old.|`|kTZevQNHaa	Well, generally, I'd be up  every single 3 hours in the evening to change and feed my son when he was a baby for the 1st year.Sometimes, he'd eat and get changed while still totally drowsy...but sleeping straight through the night...that comes at some point in the 2nd year.<br>  Now, as far as baby waking up on his own...crying etc...that generally phases out by the 9th month...but there's always certain incidents that will inspire baby to wake up sporadically--teething, with a bad cold etc...but--just hang in there Mom...a good night's sleep is upon you both soon.<br>  I put my boy to bed when he was a baby at 8  or 9pm and he'd be officially "up" by around 8 the following morning.<br>  I don't think a baby'd take "note" of Daylight Saving's Time...LOL|`|nwWBddEnaa	my daughter has slept all night since birth she really isn't a morning baby, if i wake her up at 8 for her morning bottle, she will be grumpy until she has her nap at 11 then she has her lunch and water, then play time until 3 then a 45 minute nap then play until tea at 4:45 and a bottle then we play until 6 then bath, bedtime story and bottle then to bed about 7:30-8ish and that's her until she wakes up by herself or i wake her up at 8, she has snacks during the day and will only take 3 bottles of 9Oz's a day but will drink water if thirsty. shes a very happy baby unless woken up but then again who doesn't hate getting woken up when your not ready lol, i wish you all the best x|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That sounds like sleeping through the night to me.  In general, babies are early risers.  It would be nice if you could get him to wake at 6AM reliably, but I doubt you'll have much luck getting it later than that.
xhOulzZ7aa	Did you follow all the directions correctly and leave it in the urine for the right amount of time. Sounds like the test was either done incorrectly or is faulty, try another one. Good luck|`|iNBLWIFKaa	It sounds to me like the test may have been stored improperly and part of the test line has been destroyed. Make sure the test is not expired. And, take another test. If any color comes up at all you definitely need to see a doctor. I think you might be pregnant. <br>  <br>  The antibodies that they put on that line have to be stored at room temp and used within a certain period of time (by the expiration date) So if the test is too old and the antibodies that cause the reaction (makes it turn blue or pink) are degrading, it could possibly explain why you got part of the line. If that is the case, I would assume it is positive until you are able to have the pregnancy confirmed.<br>  <br>  I hope all that makes sense<br>  :)|`|5jjGo6XTaa	you could be. 7 days late and having signs is deff a good wqy of telling ur pregger. but id pick up another just so you have a peace of mind. <br>  and it depends on when u had unpretected sex.|`|d6kekKgeaa	guessing, but probably a faulty test, get another and try again.
xOQwPGokaa	get another test a good one ept or something of the like. If you are pregnant it will show up being 7 days late.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I would definitely get a different test dear!  =)
1u4CS5J3aa	I think its a boy thing. My husband is slender also and has the marks from when he was a teen. Just quick growth spurt. the color fades.|`|p3d3E75oaa	i think he is fine but take him to the doctor so it can be checked and ease your mind|`|l00Lo2zDaa	I stay concerned so I'd give the nurse at the dr's office a call and ask her if this is something that should be looked at. Honestly to me it sounds like when I had the shingles. It hurt and itched before it broked out and when it broked out it was purple a week before it was red. But I can't see it so I can't tell you that it is or it isn't strecth marks. I obsess over everything so I'd go to the doc or give thema call anyway. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and I hope he isn't hurting from this!
JsqMSU9Haa	tell him to put on his big boy pants.  then figure out what's really going on with him - talk talk talk.  if he feels he's missing out on 'freedom', plan a weekend getaway without the kids, or have fun date nights in the house.  whatever it is - and i know its hard with young kids - but figure out what's really bothering him.  remind him it gets easier as the kids get older.  have him do some one on one fun things with the 2 year old.  have the whole family go hiking or on a picnic - show him it's possible to have fun with kids.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	If he is willing to go to counseling, even if you end up not being pregnant, I think that is the way to go.  I think there is more going on then just him not wanting another child.  He obviously is unhappy and needs to share with you why if you all want to remain married.  <br>  It might be a good idea for his to have a vasectomy if this is the way he feels.  Then you won't have to stress out about it and he won't look like a jerk for threatening to divorce you.<br>  Good luck!|`|HvALvdc7aa	Well if he wants a divorce if you are pregnant again what does that say about his love for YOU?  He sounds mean. My husband really didn't want kids either. But he continued to have sex with me knowing I wasn't using any protection. We have an 11 week old girl who has him wrapped tightly around her finger. Do you know why he doesn't want anymore kids? If he divorces you b/c your pregnant I'd take his *** threw the ringer and have him paying child support out the ying yang.|`|NS5fnxpNaa	Its not just you tell him if he doesn't want any more children go get fixed. I get so mad when they think its just upi to us for birth control, If they get fixed you don't have to worry about broken condoms and you are more relaxed with love making, talk to him about this.|`|DKfScL8taa	I think you should do your absolute best to convince him to go to counseling. That sounds really weird that he'd divorce you because you got accidently pregnant. Tell him you wont' have sex with him anymore if it is that big of a deal. Maybe if you go to counseling you can find out the underlying problem and maybe find a fix to it.|`|c73QkZ2haa	If he doesnt want more kids maybe he should go get himself fixed then theres no worries about condoms breaking. Sounds like he didnt really want kids in the first place which is unfortunate. He should probably seek some sort of counseling to help him realize how special and important his family is and isnt something to walk away from just cause you get pregnant again.<br>  I hope it all works out for you.|`|UTzEfKaMaa	if u miss the period do preg colour test,if + consult ur gynoe for m.t.p.|`|BJERgbM5aa	His condom broke!  He's an idiot!  My advise:  You do what right for you.  I'm not saying do or don't do abortion.  That's not my call - it's yours.  But either way, dump the bum.  And first tell him; "dear, I'm keeping/not keeping this pregnancy.  And I am filing for a divorce immediately.  And our divorce hearing will be in the middle of this pregnancy.  Dear, you don't have a chance in hell"  Get Out Now.  He doesn't need counseling.  He needs a good kick of reality, right in his wallet.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	That is awful. I'm so sorry. It sounds like some marriage counseling would be in order because those were knife stabbing, hurtful words. Even if he doesn't want to see one maybe start out seeing one just you and he may grow interested.<br>  <br>  Also you may want to remind him that a divorce doesn't get rid of a child support order.<br>  <br>  <br>  ((((hugs))))
AA11796667	Yes it could be. The baby's head is descending and the muscles will let you know by stretching.. Best to go to the doctor have a check up.. Good luck.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	i get that at 17 weeks but im not dilating, could be more growing or moving of baby or could be dilating w/ how far you are|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes it very well could be. i had the same thing about 3 days before going into labor. depending on how far along you are i would say you might be getting near. good luck!
pwu9xzF8aa	take him to your baby practitioner- they will check him out and chances are it is nothing, but its better to know that!

fTLzKg5Eaa	My MOm died of Cancer 3 Years ago on June 19... my Sister gave birth to her second child January 2008, My Mom was with her when she gave birth to her First Son and she was amazing and it was difficult for my Sister of course without Mom but she did it... I am Currently Pregnant with my Second CHild and it burns my Heart knowing that My Mom will never see him...but I know she would love me to have this baby as she often asked me when I was going to get pregnant.... I can not really Tell you something that will ease your Mind as it is extremely hard for me to cope with her death even now...but sometimes when I think I am so happy that my baby will be loved so much as I was loved by my Mother and it keeps me going wanting to be at least little bit like my Mom because she was Great... I just wanted to let you know you are not alone...|`|GjuRYsITaa	i had my mum there for #1 &2 but not three and 4 due to deteriorating health i have had my partner and my sister or a close friend with me though but mum always saw baby with in 24 hours|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	My parents never had a third child because there were three close family members passed away within a year and then they just never got around to it.  A slightly different reason I know, but there is a similarity here.  My Mum always wonders what it would have been like to have three - but it is too late now.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't give up having more children.  You are going through a tough time at the moment but you can do it again without your Mum.  You can do this by yourself.  Your partner will be there too.  Are there any other family members like an aunt or sister that you trust?  They could step in in your Mum's place. Talk to your Mum about it now, about how you feel.  It might help you. <br>  <br>  I'm sending good wishes out to you and your family.  Enjoy every day with your dear mum.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	i want to say im sorry and i completely understand. my mom passes away about 5 years ago from breast cancer. she was at my sisters kids births and was amazing as well. i remember how excited she was on everyone. my son is now 3 and i remember i didnt even know what to do when i found out i was pregnant, almost a part of me was jealous that my sister had my mother there and i wasnt able to.it is a hard thing to go through, i wanted more than anything for her to be there. but i had to finally realize that if at all possible her spirit was there, and that she wouldnt want me not to have the baby because she wasnt there. im sorry to ramble, i just know what your feeling. just know in your heart no matter what you mom will be there. good luck|`|MW3Br5V8aa	This hasnt happened too me but please dnt let it put u off having babies... ur mam wouldnt want that and also she WILL be by ur side.. in spirit of course she'll be there... and if u concentrate hard enuff u will know she is there....<br>  <br>  im so sorry about ur Mom though.. my thoughts are with u ..|`|0MUvGlHkaa	sorry to hear that i had my mum at my first birth and she was dying also i felt a sense of loss not to have her there she didnt make it for my 2nd child and it was hard but life goes on and we named her after my mum which gave me a certain peace inside.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	it broke my heart to read your question. i was lucky enough to have my mother at both of my deliveries. she is an RN and used to work at the hospital where i delivered so she even knew many of the nurses there. it was wonderful. i totally cannot imagine birth without here. but just because your mother may not be able to attend doesn't mean you should stop your dreams and shut down your life. i do not think she would want that. do you have a best friend that could be there with you? a grandparent maybe? good luck to you and i will say a prayer for your mother.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	Firstly, I am so sorry to hear about your mum. However, palliative care can sustain patients for a long time.<br>  <br>  I dont think that you should rush into having a child because of your mums illness, perhaps spending time with her would be better? Especially if your fiance isnt keen on the idea.<br>  <br>  However, I do understand what you mean about not wanting another without her there.  She will be there in spirit though.<br>  <br>  My ex husband was a waste of space, My mum was with me post section for the first two and there for the labour and delivery of the third, I have found out that I am pregnant again (my ex and I are now divorced and I am with a wonderful man) and my new partner wants to be at there for the delivery - but I would rather have my mum!<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you decide - my thoughts are with you<br>  x|`|lEJCZP0Qaa	I' so sorry sorry to hear that about your mum. I had my mum at my birth and she was great to so calm and helpful and i will be going through this one without her as i have moved to a diff area and she would never get here in time, i'm sure you will do great without her there at your side as she will be with you in spirit and help you through this, it will be fine as you won't be alone you will half your fiance with you aswell. wish you all the best and your mum xx|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	its nature. don't worry you can make 2nd baby|`|DhmUgq0maa	My mum was with me when i had my first baby but not with the second or third... I was a bit upset that she couldn't be there but once things started going i was in too much pain to dwell on it...my sister was with me for my third child though.
ZYlr9TSBaa	Yes.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	yes|`|AA11661793	yes. This time my husband and I tried for a while and I didn't think I was pregnant, but I had him pick up a test anyways, and it was faintly positive, I took 4 more before I believed it.|`|tzjo4aR7aa	<a href="http://onlyin.has.it" rel="nofollow">http://onlyin.has.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|1GFHtohCaa	Yes i was on the pill and got caught thought i could not be but was.|`|EX1lOaAfaa	Yes..with my first.   I thought I had food poisioning or a virus.
mlFaQ1LPaa	ok, since u had all the symptoms that normally u have be4 period..u highly unlikely to become pregnant but there's still possibility. ya precum can contain sperm but precum also will not contain sperm.10 seconds is just nth...i think there is a very slim chance u could be pregnant. remember be protected next time..and, dun be stress since upcoming period is arriving. to ease ur mind, u can take HPT test after u missed a period and u can take it right NOW.goodluck!
80ad17a4f35e6e89a61178a36b0189ceaa	Phone your midwife and ask her advice.  Every labour is different.  With my first I went into hospital when contractions about 5 mins apart and baby was born within 4 hours but with second I had weak contractions (even as close as 5 mins apart) for over 24 hours but wasn't dilating at all.  I fully dilated extremely quickly when it happened - woken at midnight by extreme pain, only just got to hospital in time.  I don't think anyone else's labour can inform you about how your body will react.  Is this your first pregnancy?  If so, you really have no way of knowing whether you are going to dilate slowly or quickly or what will happen.  Get some reassurance from your midwife and be prepared to go to hospital when your instinct tells you that it's time.  When the contractions become strong and last several seconds it's probably time to get going (I'm assuming you're not a long way from the hospital!)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|C6oTOvOMaa	Some say 5 mins apart. but if they are even 10-15 minutes apart lasting longer than 1 minute and are consistent coming in a pattern then i would go in...|`|jBdvUQEXaa	This would seem to show that your body IS in labour even if it dosnt hurt! Relax, keep aware of what your body is doing, and call a midwife or the hospital if there are any changes.<br>  <br>  I was 2 cm dliated the whole way through my last period.|`|lEJCZP0Qaa	I went to the hospital as i was having contractions but more than 5 min apart when i was 41 weeks with my last one and was only 3-4 cms dilated, they wanted to keep me in as i am counted as high rick after i had a em-c-section with my twins, but because i didnt have my stuff with me they let me go home with the understanding that i came back within the hour. But my friend who was due at the same time when she went into labour with her first she was told contraction had to 5 min apart, when she went in she was only 3cm dilated but because the pain was so bad they let her stay for some pain relief. In UK, i know in my hospital anyway if the pain is really bad and they know you are def in labour they will admit you at 4cm so at least you can have gas and air and pethadine. Hope i helped a bit and ggod luck x|`|0MUvGlHkaa	if your already dilated i wld go in as soon as your contractions begin my labour went 1hr 15 mins from first sign till him coming out so unless you want it in the car on the way i wld go as quick as you can yours may come quickly too so stuff the doctors do what u think is best
c73QkZ2haa	I think gatorade is a sports drink so no it shouldnt dehydrate you. You should be drinking at like 8 8oz glasses of water each day while your pregnant. You need alot of water. Its hard cause you pee all the time too. I just kept a large bottle of water with me at all times and drank about three of those a day. The gatorade probably has sugar in it though.|`|6G47mC9Taa	I think in pregnancy its best to drink lots of water|`|VClxXNs3aa	gatorade has salt in it which can cause dehydration.  try the grape flavored pedialyte!
s1BaLV1Laa	Sadly some woman are like that. And its totally wrong especially if the father is doing every thing he can to be their for his kids. But as wrong as this is. There is a lot of Men who could not worry one dam about there kids. And its the couple of them, that give guys such a bad name.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I agree with you 110%. <br>  <br>  What I also find interesting is that when they’re IN the relationship, they say they’d never be one of “those women”. And once things go south, some ladies DO become “that woman”. <br>  <br>  I personally will NEVER resort to that level because I see what it does to the children. My husband’s ex gf plays games with him all the time about their child and who suffers the most? My 5 yr old stepdaughter. <br>  <br>  I mean, last I checked, it does take a sperm and an egg to create a baby. And last time I checked, that takes one man, one woman to do so. So why it would take only one woman to raise THEIR child is beyond me? (Case by case of course)<br>  <br>  Only selfish parents act this way. If they truly loved their kids, they’d never stand in the way of the other parent.|`|9kbpTnroaa	Women! all the same mate .... never happy !|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	calm down you are thinking the worst that will make it happen so just think of the positives you get to raise a baby as a family! sure you will have fights that normal as a cuple to do that just ride it out don`t yell for a dvorcwe work it out|`|AA10520442	It's a power trip, using the kid as a pawn.  And it's wrong. Some women are psycho like that but not all.<br>  <br>  It's the same thing when a guy gives a girl <br>  "gifts" and when they break up it's suddenly a "loan" and he wants to be paid back for everything.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	'if the relationship ain't worked' you mean he gets a slap in the face when his cheating lying a*s gets caught out? The ultimate in disrespect to your wife and YOUR kids?   <br>  <br>  You're putting this like men are always innocent victims....|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Um...I don't know any woman who has done that.  My mom is a single mom with six kids and a few different dads and she's always tried to keep the fathers involved.  Not every woman is like that; in fact, I think most aren't unless they are super-bitter or there's some question of the father's parenting.  My sister begs my niece's dad to be more involved.  She even stopped asking for the child support she desperately needs because he was using it as an excuse not to call my niece.  He's a bit of a deadbeat.  Hopefully, I will never have to deal with this with my husband, but God forbid he left me, I would still want him involved with our daughter.  She's every bit as much a part of him as of me, although perhaps I am more emotionally invested for now, because she's only five months and I bonded with her while she was still inside of me.|`|5ewSifMraa	That my friend is how women get back at you, they say since they had the baby and that they took care of the baby, the baby is theirs.<br>  <br>  However that's just how women are, they get so emotional that they do irrational things.  And if they won't let you see their baby, then fine, just ask God to forgive her.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Why so bitter and angry? <br>  <br>  "Us women" are not all the same, no more than "you men" are.<br>  <br>  What if I said all men are deadbeats who dump their kids when they divorce? That would be a slap in the face to all the good dads out there who care about their kids.<br>  <br>  Don't judge an entire group of people by a few.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Hehehe<br>  <br>  Because Woman are CRAZY.

If the baby is kicking or she is uncomfortable she will look for someone to blame and that is you. When the children are older they will be my children until they are naughty (as thankfully  they always are sooner or later) they will be YOUR son, daughter or children depending on the circumstances. Always remember a woman is never to blame when a man is around. Of course if he is not he should have been so it is his fault anyway. Sometimes i think Muslims have it almost right|`|QveBSjFSaa	Exactly.<br>  The term deadbeat dad is thrown around too loosely. Does anyone ever consider "Insatiable Mom"?<br>  Family Law allows the relationship between a child and their divorced parents to be a business transaction.<br>  Listen to most of the posts: so many are "He's not paying enough", "He doesn't spend enough time with our child", "He never does the right thing" blahblahblah.<br>  And have you ever paid attention to how many people claim they were abused? Not saying it doesn't exist, but every victim of abuse I've ever known usually keeps it quiet, and wants to avoid drawing attention to it.<br>  But, amazingly, seems like 9 out of 10 have been abused in some way by "baby daddy", and have no problems rattling it off to anyone who will listen. Then, of course, he's not fit to be a "proper" father. So then the questions are "How can I get the father of my child to give up his rights?".<br>  Very two-faced. Unfortunately, condoned behavior by probably 48 out of 50 states.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Not all women say that, you are making a poor generlisation there.<br>  <br>  I certainly wouldn't say it and no one I know who has been in that situation would act that way. I don't know what kind of women you are exposed to, but trust me most are not like that.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Women who do this are out for revenge they usually dont realize they are hurting the child more than anyone else.

EVERYTHING! stay calm and a judge will see that. i don't agree with what you said. a girl should not do that.....the reason why she does is cause she is angry and pissed off....which is not right.....i would recommend counseling...|`|TAGsuqu2aa	I do often see this happening, it's like some women just have to much anger and just wouldn't let it go. They would allow their selfish emotions get in the way instead of seeing the real picture of how things should be, which it won't ever be because we Humans are not simple creatures. <br>  <br>  It's something my Husband and I discussed before. Of course we would love to be Married and together for the rest of our lives, but if things doesn't go that route then we have to weigh out our options. With 2 kids, the best to do is that 1 parent takes 1 child, instead of 1 parent taking both. Depending on why we would split, we know we still need to be amicable for the kids because they are most important. A couple could be over, but family life doesn't have to end.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Ive seen both men and women use children from a relationship to their advantage and to hell with what it does to them. So its not just one or the other at fault. If my husband and I ever god forbid ever seperated he would have the right to see the kids sure I might be angry at him for what ever happened but still they are his kids he does have that right. Now if its for abuse thats a whole different story then no he would not have that right. Just my views

Better to be safe than sorry I guess.

dIW2tVxhaa	Medicate her cos she's quiet? That's insane.<br>  <br>  I personally would get her checked by a doc, and in the meanwhile I would up her intake of omega 3 fish oils. Obviously diet is by far the best way to go, more oily fish like mackerel, salmon etc, and Hemp oil is also excellent- you can hide it in mashed potatoes! If you want to give it in a more regulated manner, there are capsules you can buy like eye-Q which are fab.|`|m9LxTsc3aa	I wouldn't jump right to meds. Seems like there could be other stuff going on. I would take her to her doctor to have her checked out. Tell him the problems she's having and ask his opinion.<br>  <br>  I'd also request to have an educational evaluation done. School districts have policies in place to evaluate a child by a team to help determine learning problems. Those involved would be parents, teachers, principal, school psychologist.<br>  <br>  I'd try these two options before meds.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FQJHHjVpaa	Unfortunately, that is the "in" thing these days. Teachers often tell parents to seek a medication option just to make their job of teaching easier.<br>  The child dosen't pay attention or is having trouble, so shove a pill down his or her throat. The child must have ADHD !<br>  Since when do teaching credentials come with a medical degree attached ?<br>  Have your child moved to a room with a competent teacher.|`|sYFfji1Naa	This is why i cant stand teachers, she is your child not theirs and it is NONE of their business whether or not she is medicated and its not their place to tell you to get her medicated. she is your daughter if you feel she needs a medical opinion then seek it but at the end of the day consistent discipline a good routine and a healthy diet are going to be the things she needs the most.|`|RoyvUWl7aa	dont think the teacher could say she wants her medicated...has she been evaluated? I say take her to a doctor|`|kprKXEOSaa	Well, they always want to medicate the kids, that is their answer to everything.<br>  I don't think it would do it.  I'm not in the situation, so it's hard to say, but I think I would opt out of this one.  Especially if your husband is against it, no.  You and her daddy need to work with her more, and the tutoring is probably great too.  <br>  You might look into other issues that might be affecting her, like does she eat enough?  Is she growing normally?  Does she have a vision problem?  Is she dyslexic?  If her blood sugar is out of whack, that could cause her concentration problems.  There are other things to consider before just drugging her.  Good luck!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Just a question if she isn't having behavior issues why the medication?<br>  <br>  Is your daughter LD? My son is in the reading area as well. My cousin who is 16 almost 17 tutors him 3 times a week. And he seems to be catching on better with her than with anyone else we have tried.  Try someone with in the family that your daughter feels comfortable with or enjoys spending time with.<br>  <br>  Also have you gotten her eyes checked out? My son was way behind got his eyes check and that was 1 part of the problem. He has really bad eye sight and requires glasses all the time. Which affected his reading skills. Also without his glasses the lights at the school gives him a sligh headache. So your daughter may be trying to concentrate, but looking at the small print could be hurting her eyes.|`|c73QkZ2haa	I dont know if id give my child medication to concentrate. Work with her instead to make her realize how important her school is and that she needs to pay attention. Sometimes changing a childs diet helps too with concentration and even hyperactivity but she doesnt sound HA.

HvALvdc7aa	How much is she spewing? If its alot she could have reflux. But all babies spit up that's normal. And they sleep for about 14-16 hours a day.|`|avx7bLnKaa	my son is 6-7 weeks and leeps all the time<br>  and spews occassionally when he eats too much<br>  <br>  try maybe smaller feedings more often|`|7PXFXcKfaa	by spewing do you mean spitting up? or vomiting ... (if your unsure its spit up - at this age vomit is projectile. Think "the exorcist" with a baby!)<br>  <br>  If she has been vomiting you should absolutely take her to the doctor - its far too early to risk anything. <br>  <br>  If its just spit up, its normal!<br>  <br>  At around the 3 week marker, babies go through a huuuuge growth spurt. When babies sleep is when babies grow. My doctor says its possible for babies to grow up to 1 cm in a 24 hour period during a growth spurt, and that needs ALOT of sleep!!! <br>  <br>  However if your concerned with her behaviour, sleeping too much, spitting up too much, or even if your instinct is saying something is just "not right," dont hesitate to go to your doc! <br>  <br>  Remember worrying mummies are all part of a Peds training!|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Newborns sleep ALOT! <br>  <br>  Anywhere from 18-20 hours if not a little more per day! <br>  <br>  They have alot of Growing to do! As long as she is still eating, urinating, and having bowel movements she should be fine. <br>  <br>  However, as always, if you are worried contact her Ped, but like I said. Its very common for newborns to sleep and spit up. As long as it isnt projectile vomiting and just a little spit up here and there, its fine!|`|NS5fnxpNaa	New baby's do sleep a lot, sleep ,eat, poop, and yes even throw up that is all part of there little lives at that age. I would not worry unless the baby gets a fever or just throws up and he/she starts to loss weight. Just enjoy this time with your baby.|`|DKfScL8taa	Sounds normal to me. If it makes you comfortable go to the doctor.
jNgh3e3Faa	The mixing of bottle (EASY) and breast (hard)......which one would you choose?<br>  There is also nipple confusion, too. But it sounds like he is choosing the easy route. Don't give him the bottle and keep trying to nurse him. OR express into a bottle and give it to him that way. <br>  My kids were greedy also. I stuck with breast only with most of them. (read up on nipple confusion many years ago.)<br>  Baby is worth it...keep on trying.
c73QkZ2haa	it will not hurt to practice with him. Thats how they learn. We also have our son pull himself up from a lying dow position while grasping our fingers. Our PHN told us this helps strengthen the back muslces. If he enjoys it go for it. Like you said though catch him when he teeters. Ive also found the nursing pillow to help with giving back support when sitting on the floor.<br>  ETA: My twins are almost 4 months and one likes sitting up the other doesnt. I would never do this with our wee girl cause she doesnt have good muscle control yet but our son holds his head up and doesnt do the weeble wobble ne more. But if he enjoys it and has good control of his head and neck theres no reason why not.|`|DKfScL8taa	I don't think so just sit him up between two couch cushsions. We had my son sitting up at 2 weeks assisted because he did not like being held like a baby.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Yes you can harm the baby.  Neck and back muscles are poorly, if at all developed and consider the weight of the baby's head in proportion to his tiny body.  You can do a lot of damage.  Do not follow these "guidelines" which say a baby should be doing such and such at such and such an age.  Let the poor things develop at their own pace.  They will sit up when they are ready, and 11 weeks is too young!<br>  <br>  I watched my brother-in-law trying to sit up his young son and he was so distressed because he was obviously not ready.  All because some stupid, no it all busy body at some government office (where there are no creche facilities!) decides what should be the "norm".|`|h8bzwBhKaa	Your baby may look strong, lots of baby's can hold there head really well, but i wouldn't sit him up on his own as baby's bones are still soft and forming, and they start sitting on there own from 6-8 months.<br>  You could sit him in a baby chair which is laid back, and if he pulls him self forward he can sit back when hes tried.|`|nwWBddEnaa	my daughter has always hated been laid on her back it was like she thought she was missing out on things (a nosey baby lol) so at first we had a rock seat that we put her in until she had her neck control then we would sit her on our knee resting on our chest the it was sitting up away from our body, it really helped, i wish you the best of luck x<br>  <br>  at 11 weeks my daughter was only 9lbs born at 4lbs 11ozs|`|rijkJXvGaa	hiya, my daughter is 10 weeks old and from day1 she has been able to hold her head off my shoulder for about 5 seconds, and that has increased to up to 10/15 mins now at 10 weeks, she has always hated laying flat and for the last 2/3 weeks when shes in her chair shes been trying to lift her head as if she is trying to sit up, during my health visitors last visit i had my baby on my lap and she was sitting upright (with my support but holding her head up) for over 10 mins and the health visitor actually said she was amazed, i mentioned that i was thinking of getting a Bumbo seat unit to start using in about 2 weeks (as its reccomended from 12 weeks) and she said that as she has such good head control that i could put her in it for a few mins at a time now so i went and bought the Bumbo yesterday and she has been in it about 3/4 times today for 5 mins each time and she loves it, my daughter weighs 11lb and is 57cms long, i think each baby grows at their own rate some are alot more advanced in certian areas, my daughter hasnt started rolling yet where as my eldest daughter rolled at 9 weeks but was late to crawl and walk, maybe get a Bumbo and give that a try, if you babys an nosy as mine he will love it !!! xx
BtxQogSzaa	Ive got a 19 month old too....and i was thinking the same thing..<br>  But take another look at your question....and look at what she can say, that is  actually ALOT! i know it doesnt sound like much but when you write it down it is quite a bit. plus most children dont start talking really well until they're about 2. my older son wasnt a big talker and i was worried, by the time he had his second birthday he was talking loads, now hes 3  he wont shut up LOL,<br>  <br>  Just to let you also know...my youngest (the 19 month old) can only say: 'go go go', 'meow' 'oof' 'hot' and 'mum' 'da' about it really so really your little one is doing great!<br>  dont worry|`|oxITtcIsaa	Hi<br>  I have a 20 month old boy, and i surely think that all kids are different. Most of his peer group seem to be in the same stage as your daughter however this one strangely has started speaking short sentences- such as i want milk, papa is sleeping etc. he repeats most words and sings a few hindi songs (we are from India) with me... he has a 3 year old elder brother and i think that interaction makes all the difference.|`|sYFfji1Naa	my daughter was fluent in english by the time she was one, i had her in early learning lessons and was extremely interactive with her speach training, she is now 4 and is fluent in japanese and spanish as well, then i know some 4 year olds who can barely string two words together, every child is different and you will probably find if she doesnt exceed at speach at a young age there will be something else she does better than most dont worry too much about it just stay active and make her say as much as u can eg dont let her have a drink, toy, food or whatever she may want until she can say one word describing it, eg apple|`|8ELfnTODaa	my 18 month old is going through a sponge stage. we teach him something once and if it's simple he's got it down. but my mother in law is a retired teacher and teaches him every day so that's probably the reason for that. my husband's cousin's son however is already two and barely saying mom, dad and ice. everyone learns differently and your daughter really is talking a lot more than a lot of kids that age.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	My son is 19 months (well, until next week =)) he's delayed with his speech but he can say:  ma, da da, more, I want (and then he jibber jabbers), what's that, yeah and no.  He does sign language for more, thank you, please and I love you.  <br>  <br>  He does jabber all the time, and sounds a lot like your daughter with the things he understands and knows.  But he's been far too busy learning his physical skills to pay much attention to the verbal.
2nsNvIanaa	u should av kept active like walkin every day that wud av helped.it depends|`|vue9NOhYaa	Ultrasounds are VERY inaccurate in estimating fetal size.  They can easily be off by a pound or two (500 grams or more) in either direction. So your baby may be a very reasonable 3 1/2-4 kg. <br>  <br>  Women rarely grow babies 'too big' to deliver vaginally. To help matters, be sure that you are allowed to move around and push in positions most comfortable for you. Dont' let anyone force you to be lying on your back, or 'propped up' -- those positions dont' let your pelvis open as it needs to.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	they will let you try vaginally at first but if any problems come up like the baby is to big to come out then they will do a csection. the ultrasound can be off by 1-2lbs either way so you never know it might be alittle smaller then what it is saying.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	My ex had a normal vaginal delivery with our son, and he was 9 lb 14 oz at birth. You should be ok, unless baby is breech at time of delivery.

The doctor might have to do c-section on you. I have a 6lbs and 5 lbs babies and it is hard for me already.
bAp35x7uaa	I get nauseated from coughing anyway so wouldn't class this as a pregnancy symptom.<br>  <br>  However, feeling queasy or being sick at the drop of a hat ARE pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  Add to that the fact that false positives are rare  while false negatives are not!.  So missus, if you got a positive, regardless of how faint, it looks as though you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  Make sure your doctor does a blood test though and not a wee test.  Home pregnancy tests are more sensitive than those used at the docs so if you're getting negatives at home, you'll get a negative at the surgery.<br>  <br>  Also, do a test first thing in the morning and use 10miu ultra early test strips.  Doctors (and most other tests) are 25miu which don't test positive until after a period is due.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations xx|`|dXAgTUSraa	Just go get pregnacy test and you know you can go to womens clinics  they r pregnancy clinics and alot r free. get online and check for ones in your area, good luck and best wishes.|`|GjuRYsITaa	when i cough at the moment i have to leg it to the loo cause i start being sick or a certain smell can set me off an all|`|cTvP6j7Haa	I hope you are not pregnant, your English needs a lot of work, with a baby you won't have time anymore.<br>  Peace.|`|ZnwKjH6waa	Take a Test....|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Why not take a pregnancy test?

I took 5 home pregnancy tests with my first child, all come up neg but one, i waited 2 weeks and got a blood test and i was pregnant, i was 8 weeks along and i had low hcg levels.

59GymH27aa	I know its probably not what you want to hear but you need to let go.  His gf is not going to be happy about it and there are kids involved now so it's not going to be a nice situation for anyone.  Jealousy is a strong horrible feeling and I too would be jealous if someone from my partners past came back into his life.  It can be hard because after being with someone for years (his baby's mum) things can seem stale and the arrival of someone knew can be very tempting.  I think if you contacted him you would be making a mistake.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	I wouldn't go there. You can't go backwards. You have a partner now, he has a partner, you each have a child. I understand you want a platonic relationshiop, but it sounds like Derek's wife/gf would be pretty threatened by a call out of the blue from you.<br>  <br>  You are lonesome or missing something in your life, and you think that reconnecting with Derek will fill that hole, but it won't. You need to put energy into connecting better with your present man, or making or inproving friendships with girlfriends, or maybe doing something creative and/or fun just for you. Perhaps you could join a club, a church, or a group where you have more of a social outlet.
YFPMcHCbaa	Implantation bleeding is pretty uncommon. Could be a side effect of missing the pill. I wouldn't stop taking the pill though. Even if you are pregnant, continuing the pill probably won't hurt the baby.

Otherwise there is a high chance that the baby will cause develop "nipple confusion" (aka bottle preference, its easier to get milk from a bottle and some newborns are lazy)<br>  *No formula until 6 weeks, during the first 6 weeks is when your breasts develop prolactin receptors based on demand.  Without enough prolactin receptors its harder to maintain your supply.<br>  <br>  Even with all that you need to understand that pumping is more work than breastfeeding.  And that not all women can pump milk, or maintain a supply while partly pumping, particularly if they add formula.<br>  <br>  You also need to understand that one bottle of formula will change the flora and the pH of the digestive tract of the baby for 2-3 weeks.  Making the baby more like a formula fed baby in terms of susceptibility to intestinal infections, constipation, stomach flu, etc.  Because one of the primary mechanisms of of the immune system is in the digestive system they are more likely to get normal colds as well.

So whether you have breastmilk or formula in it, the baby will want the bottle.  This is a problem because then your body and the baby will never really learn how to nurse, and your odds of producing breastmilk for a long period of time without actual nursing on the breast is low.<br>  <br>  Second, breastmilk is much healthier for your baby and easier on their stomachs.  Formula will cause gas, bloating, and all sorts of other digestive problems.  Then you're caught in a situation where you are searching for what brand of formula causes less problems in your baby.  All the while, every time you change, the baby is forced to readjust to the new kind of formula.<br>  <br>  Third, you can breastfeed your baby and pump, so that you don't always have to be the main source of food.  The best scenario is that you work hard and nurse directly for 2-3 weeks and then slowly start to add pumping time in and let somebody else feed with a bottle.  This will give you a break and allow daddy or others to enjoy feeding time.  You don't have to put formula in a bottle, you can put your own milk in there.<br>  <br>  Fourth, formula is very expensive.  Have you really considered the price... the daily price of formula.  Your breastmilk is FREE, and by the way, the absolute best thing for your baby.<br>  <br>  Fifth, supplementing 1/2 breastmilk and 1/2 formula is possible, but you need to spend weeks if not months exclusively breastfeeding first to establish a good supply and make sure that you and baby both get the hang of it first.  1/2 and 1/2 is not the best scenario, but some breastmilk in a baby's diet is better than no breastmilk.  So after a couple weeks or months, including formula in your baby's diet will give you a break from pumping and/or allow somebody else to take over for you... if that encourages you to continue some breastmilk production than it is better than giving up entirely.  It all depends on the effort that you're willing to give to your baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DKfScL8taa	Yes you can. I don't know why that "RN" said your baby will prefer formula. Mine gagged and vomited on formula, and I know that happens with alot of breastfed babies. He also wouldn't take the bottle, but I introduced that kind of late. At about 3 weeks you should introduce the bottle and formula, or after he is well established on the boob.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	Of course it is! however i would be veeery clear on your expectations before you start!!<br>  <br>  First you do have to get your breastmilk supply established ... i know everyone bangs on about it, but its true. Your body only makes what it needs, and if you start with formula half and half then its likely the formula is going to end up taking over ... when you get to a growth spurt your body just wont make enough!<br>  <br>  In the beginning (esp if your a first time mummy!) breastfeeding is hard, painful and frustrating, and to be honest i think if your doing it just because you feel you should, you probably wont stick it out. You really have to want it. <br>  Im breastfeeding now, my little one is 5 weeks, and i just am beginning to feel that were getting there... the first 2 or 3 weeks i nearly gave up so so SO many times, but im glad i stuck it out now!! <br>  <br>  Also ... i dont want to dampen your spirits at all but pumping is not as easy as it sounds, unless your using a hospital grade pump. A pump is never ever ever going to get as much milk as a baby, and when you see what youve produced after x hours of pumping, it can be quite disheartening. I also found it quite clinical and painful too .. feeding straight from the source was also painful, but much more rewarding! <br>  <br>  Also i personally found the formula trap to be a bit dangerous... Formula takes longer to digest, therefore baby sleeps longer, and its reaaally hard to motivate yourself to do things like pump when you know that baby is out for 3 hours and you could just go to bed! <br>  <br>  If i were you i would start aiming for breastfeeding only, just for the first month or so. If you do this, your body will make enough milk, and you can really start to get established. Sure introduce formula if you want after, but if you do it right from the beginning, i think it would be too hard to keep the balance. Formula is just so damn easy. <br>  <br>  I still use formula occasionally. . . maybe one bottle a week. My husband lets me trundle off to bed early on his day off, he feeds her at night, and she sleeps until morning and i get a full nights sleep! Im not a breast nazi ... but to be honest when you have a child all your preconceptions about what you think you will do totally go out the window! <br>  <br>  On the other side though .. .dont let the boob nazis make you feel guilty about mixed feeding - more people are doing it than youll ever know! <br>  <br>  Try to just wait until your little one is here before you impose any massive ideas on yourself... Go with what works best for both of you, and youll both be happy!|`|Nux5S6oVaa	It is, but more than likely your baby is going to prefer formula.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would breastfeeding and pump...and using the pumped milk in a bottle when needed.  It's the best for the infant and the baby won't be confused...Breastmilk has more fat and calories than formula it's also has the immunity the child needs.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
TwVd0etQaa	Tell them straight away. Its important that they do a risk assessment with you early on so you know things you can and cannot do within your job, I.e lifting and cleaning with chemicals and so on.

But really? Think about it… she will be the butt end of pickup lines.<br>  <br>  Allegra is just horrible… but a lot better not matched up with honey. <br>  <br>  "Honey Allegra" it sounds like a porn star, stripper or exotic dancer, and her initials would be H.A.M, honey ham, what if she is overweight? In general honey ham isn't the greatest.<br>  <br>  Lola means sorrows, perfect. Besides the Kinks wrote a song called "Lola" and it’s about a transvestite. <br>   <br>  "Well Im not the worlds most physical guy<br>  But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine<br>  Oh my lola lo-lo-lo-lo lola<br>  Well I’m not dumb but I cant understand<br>  Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man<br>  Oh my lola lo-lo-lo-lo lola lo-lo-lo-lo lola"<br>  <br>  <br>  Joanna isn’t bad at all.<br>  <br>  Heidi, it’s my cousins name, I  think of a chubby girl with white blond hair that is braided into piggy tails, sweet little thing with a southern ancient… and she is related to<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Laura Ingles!<br>  <br>  <br>  Bronx is a boys name, Pete Wentz and Ashlee Simpson named there little boy "Bronx Mowgli Wentz" besides do you really want to name your kid after one of the least less fancy, lush, rich places in the world?

The Gypsy character who played the love interest of "The Hunch back" in the Disney movie, and notable story (which dates back to 1830)  "The hunch back of Notre Dame" The only plus of Esmeralda is the nickname Esmee pronounced (Es May)<br>  <br>  I like Ireland, it’s better than Bronx, Ireland is an actual place people want to visit…|`|eJMIazhLaa	I like the name Lola Joanna.

Honey Elizabeth, Honey Francesca, or even Honey Mary Martin sounds really pretty.<br>  <br>  I love the other modern first names too (Esmeralda Ireland is really green, by the way lol), and I think my favorite would be Lola.  It could be a nickname for something like Lilian.  Esmeralda would be pretty shortened to Esme too, which might make your sister like it better lol.<br>  <br>  Other suggestions - <br>  <br>  Lily-Rose Francesca Martin<br>  Lilian "Lola" Esme Martin<br>  Adelaide "Heidi" Diana Martin (to make it a bit more classic)<br>  Esme Elizabeth Martin<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!

Not sure, because of differences in areas.

Low income housing is just that. It's designed for people with little or no income. As a matter of fact, in the county I live in, a 3 person family can not make more than $21,650. If I were you, I would not quit your job just so you can go into public housing. Even though the rent will be cheap, it's not worth lowering your income for.

(e.g. classical music) if he learns to associate music with sleeping it will help him nod off again during the night. it will also drown out the noises of the house (so you don't have to tip toe).<br>  - leave a very dim lamp on all night. that way you can silently feed and change him as needed without turning on a bright light and waking him up again.<br>  - use a day time and a night time voice. at night, whisper only when absolutely necessary, otherwise: say nothing at all. Keep eye contact to a minimum too. this will help him drift off to sleep instead of wanting to play and interact during the night.<br>  - keep everything you need by your bed. so if he wakes up drenched in a nappy, you  can swiftly change him and start the patting of the bottom again.<br>  <br>  <br>  - all families have been through what you are going through don't worry :)|`|37cK2IFPaa	dont **** any one where did ur husband **** u            on that night n where where he touch u

That first night I'll never forget, I couldn't sleep because I was too busy looking at him!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Without a doubt it was the day I discovered that my huge jar of Bepanthen was useful for propping the door to the nursery open...otherwise this lard-like "cream" is totally useless:) Have a nice day Mrs Bepanthen.|`|0viZhxi6aa	I have three kids, and it was a bit different for each. With Faith, it was when I woke up out of my drug induced stupor after delivery and got to hold her for the first time. I was 18, and scared to death but when I looked at her I knew we could do anything. With Hope it was the first time she latched on properly when we were learning to breastfeed. She just looked up at me, and I felt like I was on top of the world. Here was this little baby, helpless all by herself, needing nourishment. And I was the one giving it to her! (I wasn't able to breastfeed my first, so this was a new feeling to me) With my son it was when he was 3 days old and I held him for the first time. He was so tiny (under 4 lbs) but I was sitting there holding him and he woke up and looked up at me. He was still hooked up to the ventilator and doped up, but he woke up enough to look at me and I could just tell he loved me as much as I love him.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	For right now it was the moment after he was born and was settled in my arms. He was just so beautiful and so precious...I could not believe my husband and I had created something so wonderful and precious. It was a beautiful moment and time stood still as we looked at each other, finally meeting face to face for the first time.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	a couple of hours after his birth.<br>  my husband went home for a sleep, so baby and i were alone at the hospital.<br>  he snuggled in to me underneath my pajamas and we had a whole night long cuddle skin to skin.<br>  he'd beam up at me and have long eye contact, then snuggle in and have a sleep for awhile.. smiling in his sleep... then he'd wake and look straight at my eyes again..<br>  i was so pumped with adrenaline i wasn't at all tired, so i just watched him and cuddled him until my husband wanted a turn in the morning :)<br>  <br>  i often think back to that night when i'm holding my 4.5mth old and am amazed at how he acts exactly the same way when he's tired, but he's so so SO much bigger!|`|32866571f9996aa9d609f6f782586569aa	Being wheeled out of the labour ward after a c section with my beautiful twin daughters cradled in my arms.

She was only a few days old and I just woke up in the middle of the night and lay watching her and I will always remember how beautiful and peaceful she was in that moment.  I couldn't stop myself from crying and promising her that I would always look after her no matter what happened and she was so special to me.|`|2GhwuXksaa	My most special moment with my daughter...........<br>  <br>  I had my daughter 2 months early due to pre-eclampsia, she was in SCBU for 6 weeks. The most special moment I had was when at 3 and a half weeks old I got to hold her in my arms for the first time, I was so happy I cried! She was a very poorly baby with a multitude of problems but had pulled through. She was there, in my arms, all cuddled up. <br>  <br>  She is now a year old and a real Mummy's girl, she knows who I am!|`|UR9BX77haa	I could say lots but theres one that I put right at the top. <br>  <br>  When she was born - by c-section, because of an illness I had there was a big risk of stillbirth, she struggled to breath and needed massaging and oxygen but after what seemed like forever she let out a big scream.She was passed to my hubby who was sat next to me & I'll never forget she was wrapped up in a white blanket with her little head and hands sticking out the top. Her big blue eyes were open, staring at me and her tiny fingers were wriggling.I could just about touch her fingers to count them all and was so relieved that she was safe now and I called her by her name for the first time. <br>  That was incredible and I will never forget it!|`|rhypzNW8aa	The most special moment with my babies (got 4,im greedy) wasn't when i first saw them it was when i was first alone with them.I remember with my first child unwrapping him from all those blankets and having a really good look at him,looking at his tiny fingers and toes and his little sleeping face,knew right then and there id love him forever|`|758cDKEFaa	my most special moment with my baby boy was when he was first born.<br>  it was the first time i ever got to see him - what could be more special?<br>  i couldnt stop staring at him, he was just so small and perfect in every way, i couldnt of asked for anything better!<br>  even though i hadnt slept all the night before because i was having strong contractions, i stayed up all night watching him sleep like a little angel, i couldnt believe after 9 months he was finally here, with me and all mine!i <br>  couldnt believe that id bought this beautiful boy into the world and that i created him witht the person i love the most!<br>  that monent was very special to me and will stay with me forever ?|`|iMaTMWMxaa	My most special moment with my youngest daughter, was the second she cried. I had complications in pregnancy and was told I could lose her at any time from 32 weeks.<br>  <br>  When she was born, I just kept asking, is she ok, is she ok. To have that first hold and feed, was so overwhelming.|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Has to be seeing my hubby and new dad's face when they lifted them over the curtain to show us then being wheeled out of the operating theatre with a baby in each arm, Kylie in one Thomas in the other looking one side then the other and thinking 'Oh My they are mine i am a mum to two!' and hearing people say 'AWW look twins' still amazing and they are 11 this year !|`|KDf30Iqjaa	with both of my children my daughter after bleeding through my pregnancy and having scares that i miscarried or had an ectopic to find that when she was born she had no major health issues! just poor circulation and extra creases in her thigh (which she still has- now 3yrs old), as for my son his first proper beaming smile at 2 hours old and staring right at me!!

I haven't been feeling well for a few days, so last night I was laying on the couch and I told my daughter (she'll be 2 in April, so I guess it's my most special moment with my toddler) that Mommy has a sore head.

The risk of infection is far less if you were to do it than a doctor.|`|AA12279950	Why would you need to feel your cervix?  Personally I think it's best to leave your cervix alone, whether pregnant or not.|`|FA1rRzUxaa	i have asked this question as i found out on Saturday that i am pregnant. I have felt my cervix and is seems open, so im a bit worried.<br>  <br>  Some people have said it is dangerous, but others have said its fine. Its totally safe to have sex throughout pregnancy, obviously the penis will hit the cervix, so im sure feeling it gently with your finger is fine. Just make sure your finger is clean.|`|IT5rd93xaa	no not at all.|`|Iu0AJDviaa	no.
mx3gFmIKaa	Ok, you having brown eyes have 1 brown allele.  The other is unknown.  Your Mom brown, dad hazel.  You can not be certain that you have a green allele.  Your grandma on your mom's side, if this is the one with green eyes your mom has 1 green 1 brown with brown eyes and you got the brown allele from her.  If the grandma with green eyes is dad's mom and dad has hazel then you could have gotten 1 green allele from dad but its just as likely you got 1 blue allele from dad.<br>  <br>  BF having hazel eyes has no brown alleles.  Probably 1 blue, 1 green<br>  <br>  Brown eyes are dominant, other eyecolor is more light sensitive but have never heard it has an increased cancer risk.<br>  <br>  Green eyes are the most rare, only 1-2 percent of the population has them.<br>  <br>  your other allele is either green or blue.  If you throw the brown allele its brown eyes and that is 50 percent of the time<br>  <br>  If you throw the recessive allele you will have an eyecolor other than brown 50 percent of the time.  If that other allele is green then 25 percent chance green, 25 percent chance blue<br>  <br>  If the recessive allele is blue then whenever you throw it 50 percent of the time, the eyes will be blue<br>  <br>  I have brown eyes, all my siblings (3) have brown eyes, both parents have brown eyes, of all 4 grandparents 2 have brown eyes, 2 have blue<br>  <br>  Husband has blue, all his siblings (3) have blue, all his parents, and grandparents have/had blue eyes.<br>  <br>  Our kids have oldest-green, middle son blue, youngest hazel<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color" rel="nofollow">http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_col...</a>|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Eye color is not linked to cancer and green eyes are the rarest color. It would be a genetic fluke for your child to have green eyes, but it is possible.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend could only have given the baby a blue eye gene, and each of your parents would have given you one, so a brown from your dad and possibly a lighter color from your mom...and you only pass one on to your baby.<br>  <br>  There is no way to tell what the chances will be with green as it is not a real gene but a unique combination of the brown and the blue.|`|d2d2be143e2e06d5195e38164e0bb617aa	Brown eyes
bAp35x7uaa	depending on the test you used, it probably was too early.  Most tests only work after your period was due.<br>  <br>  I had the grumbling too when I first got pregnant but not until  around 5-6 weeks.  <br>  <br>  But as you've still a week to go before your period, and even if this was the month you conceived, you haven't conceived yet - you're still only in the fertilisation/implantation stages so you wouldn't have any symptoms at this point.   <br>  <br>  Test again in a week and good luck to you xxx|`|9kbpTnroaa	Probably meaqns your about to fart .... I really wouldn't read into it too much.. <br>  <br>  If your that worried go see ya doctor|`|UT2tv5N3aa	yes it could be anything|`|VhrUtQc2aa	Well when i was pregnant the doctor told me it does not matter when you do the test cause something changes in your urine that detects if your pregnant or not straight away so there is no special time or day/s to check. Keep in mind everyone is different with their pregnancy|`|dXAgTUSraa	could just be your body makin noises, sometimes i get like gurgly noises but usually it passes. I know that sounds silly sorry. Maybe just make appt with your ob/gyn and find out for sure.|`|GHlYbDfJaa	Sounds like hunger...but I think you did test too early to tell for sure.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I have never heard of grumbling before, you must bear in mind that that could also be trapped wind.<br>  <br>  As it is a week before your period it may be too soon to test. Wait until you miss your period and test, then wait for another week and re-test (that is if your period hasn't arrived by that point).<br>  <br>  If you were pregnant it could also be too early to detect any signs. However some women do detect signs such as <br>  <br>  *mild cramping<br>  *nausea<br>  *implantation bleeding<br>  *fatigue|`|oitdhF7kaa	You are pregnant! It was just the baby releasing gas(Fart) inside your belly. Completely normal.<br>  Good luck!|`|c1pM8o1Iaa	I never had any belly grumbling when I was pregnant. The fertilized egg attaches to your uterus. you cannot feel this for several months. You probably were hungry or had gas.|`|xhOulzZ7aa	A little early to test, leave it another week or so. Best of luck if you are ttc|`|J1Frx83haa	yes|`|Fb0wSA1Gaa	maybe your hungry?

hGY08GjRaa	Well, depot gives pretty good protection against pregnancy, but not 100%.<br>  <br>  If they REALLY want to avoid pregnancy, she'll stay on birth control, AND they'll use spermicidal condoms, EVERY time.|`|8CuQa2OJaa	It's possible. Nothing is 100%. There is flaws in everything. It is highly unlikely, but not impossible.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	For god sake, how old is he?  two years old. if he wasn't wearing protection (condom) then YES he could of got her pregnant. he sounds very immature to be having sex.|`|FERfSYtzaa	take the test|`|moKcMo3Iaa	well the depot is a form of contraception so its highly unlikely but as everyone knows no contraception is 100%|`|6akCILTQaa	have a virginity test done with a doctor, probably that might help|`|p3d3E75oaa	well nothing is 100% but I have to say no|`|UT2tv5N3aa	maybe nothing has 100 percent guarantee now does it
AA12069128	Anytime you have sex, unless one or the other is infertile there is a chance of pregnancy. No birth control is 100 percent effective. Should you worry?

e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	You can do it any time as long as you dont keep them on their tummy for sleep (due to SIDS) and if they can move their head.  I've been told to put a sleep positioner or something on their side so they can lay on their back but tilted to the one side very slightly.  Or they will get a flat head in the back.  You definitely can do it once the baby gets more head control|`|MeYILJeSaa	We started tummy time the day he came home from the hospital. If baby gets fussy on the floor or on a mat, then you can always put him on your tummy. There's no reason you can't start this early-it can only be beneficial.|`|c73QkZ2haa	I started putting them on their tummies when they had more awake periods so around 3-4 weeks.

PyMd95T7aa	i had it with all my kids its where your ribs are 'pushed' out the way by the baby when your pregnant and theyre still sore after as they have to go back 'in place' its normal|`|689yOzlpaa	I've never heard about that. You should go to your doctor and have him check it out. Good luck,.|`|AA10063059	its where you were stretched during pregnancy,it is harmless and usually happens in the pelvis and hip region and is called symphis pubis dysfunction DVT|`|0SHOXqb4aa	Yes, but it went away a couple of weeks after the birth.
UXoTCL98aa	lol I'm 9 weeks and 2 days and I stopped drinking anything with caffeine the moment I found out as well. Then about 2 weeks ago I just HAD to have a sweet tea from McDonald which is probably loaded w/ caffeine. I've had 3 all together since then. I felt bad that I gave in, but since it's honestly not that bad for you I figure I can indulge in one every now in then. lol<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have more than 200 grams of caffeine a day while being pregnant. I'm not sure how much caffeine is in a can of dr.pepper but I'm almost positive that you could even drink 2 cans a day and be okay(under 200 grams).<br>  <br>  I used to be a mtdewaholic---like drink anywhere from 3-6 cans a day everyday so I'm still proud of myself. I could get away with still drinking 1 or 2 a day and be okay, but for me It's just better not to get the taste of it I think. <br>  <br>  Do they have a Caffeine Free Dr. Pepper? you'd be surprised b/c I bet there is no tasted difference. I have tried a few caffeine free mt. dews and I was expecting to hate them or them to be kinda diety tasting  but surprising they tasted EXACTLY alike.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	You can have caffeine. Just limit yourself. The doctor told me I could enjoy up to two cups of regular coffee a day. I am sure one can of soda will not hurt! I personally do not drink two cups of coffee in one day but it's nice to know i can if i really want to.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	when i was pregnant with my first baby, the only thing I could keep down was coca-cola icees from burger king.  my nutritionalist said that at least it was calories.

I had some coffee and while I can't say for sure it made a difference since I've never gone to a 20wk ultrasound caffeine free, my daughter did move around some and we were able to see that she was a little girl.  I just thought I'd throw that out there.|`|GqDmkAl3aa	I know alot of people are going to tell you no caffine. When I was pregnant I would drink 2-3 cups of coffee and soda half the day, (till i got gestational diabetes at 32 weeks) BUT my daughter is going to be 2 years old and VERY VERY smart! I dont see anything wrong with it, but honestly its ur judgement because its ur child.|`|UAU3wPC0aa	Don't drink caffeine items it's injurious to ur baby.If u had a drink then after 10 minutes drink two glass of pure water.Good luck for u.|`|DV6wYtwvaa	wow no caffeine go you!! since i have gotten towards the end of my pregnancy it has been so hard!! one can is perfectly fine, enjoy!!|`|vue9NOhYaa	You can have up to 200 mg. of caffeine per day, in any form you enjoy.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	my doctor told me that i can have one glass of caffeine a day. something equivalent to a cup of coffee. JUST ONE!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	I tried that in the beginning of my pregnancy too and I commend all of you who are still on the no caffeine diet!  I, however, couldn't do it.  For someone who used to drink 3 cups of coffee a day, sweet tea, diet coke, etc., it was so hard for me.  I only have one cup of coffee a day now.  Headaches are bad enough in pregnancy as they are and caffeine withdrawals are not fun!  So your can of Dr. Pepper won't do any harm.  Any caffeine in moderation is perfectly fine.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Yes its perfectly okay I drank dr pepper here and there through my pregnancy and I had a healthy baby girl. Don't worry a lil soda is okay jus as long as your not drinking it all day|`|x6G2wPjLaa	you know neither have i, but yesterday i had a can of coke and it felt good!! 1 can is ok as long as you dont drink like 3 or more everyday! you dont have to cut it out completely just cut down!|`|90zcKChJaa	Have at it. You can have up to 12 oz. of caffeine a day. I have a cup of coffee every morning, just don't drink more than that. ;)
TQW5E6olaa	No, hippy :)|`|j2mRop0laa	You should be ashamed of yourself for even THINKING about asking those questions. <br>  <br>  But I will answer them, of course! :)<br>  I should be ashamed of myself, too.<br>  <br>  Charli that was Diet Rum, I just lied.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Belts....lets see, are your pants falling down? <br>  A nekked butt would start as much debate as beating the kids I think.<br>  You guys really have fun when I'm not usually on here don't you?|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Sure it is as long as You have Like Minded People answering your Question|`|JsqMSU9Haa	no, hitting with belts is abuse.  it's overkill.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It depends on other people's perceptions honestly! I see you have asked this question all ready..well done! LOL|`|hVVALFAPaa	If your question is whether to use a belt or not-- don't.<br>  <br>  It is a little too much to spank with a belt, but I have no problem with a swat on the rear for a misbehaving toddler. <br>  <br>  Once they are past the toddler age, though, there are other methods that are more effective than spanking-- get them where it really hurts-- what matters most to them -- grounding, no tv, no friends, no bike, no video games-- whatever is meaningful to your child. Then be consistent and stick to it! If you say no tv for two weeks, then make SURE there is no tv for two weeks.|`|AA12145826	If your pants are falling down then you must definitely wear a belt....so what does that have to do with discipline?<br>  <br>  Discipline is to the parenting section as breastfeeding is to the newborn section....there is no right or wrong answer accept when the child's well-being and overall health is called into question (which everyone on either side of the argument is going to use as their battle cry.....). I'm not one to attack, but I can't speak those who don't know you as well as I (kinda) do. LoL :o)|`|FvYqKZSMaa	It is possible.There are argument s  on a lot of questions even those that do have a right answer eX.How old was marco polo when he first left.He was 17.But people still argue just to start rises.I would ask it anyways.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I'd answer your question!  And who cares how other people perceive it.  Mine are almost always perceived incorrectly.<br>  <br>  And if it gets ugly, you could always delete your own question to prove your intention wasn't' to start an attack.|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Just ask anyways...you know you have decent contacts that will answer maturely...maybe a star or two will lead you someone else on their contacts that can also answer maturely. lol<br>  Thats sucks eh...wondering if your Q will start WW4. I'll answer--|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	DITTO SMILE<br>  <br>  How dare you. Child abusers verse lazy parents.<br>  <br>  I'll bring the popcorn, you just sit back and we'll giggle over the whole think.|`|546002402354e9578d6e24307bab333baa	Yes I think it is possible. I try to answer questions with an unbiased opinion, and others on her should try too! What type of question are you interested in asking about discipline?|`|RLoilwCNaa	Ask away! and then be prepared to defend yourself!|`|64f9613dd1a4452e24f6f8f603fab217aa	i think it is possible yet being some one who feels physical harm is NOT a form of discipline but a form of abuse, I feel a lot of moms feel the same. that is why I get upset when people speak of hitting their child, I think of the child and it is upsetting to me and so very sad, I do not know if this is what you are referring to but it is a touchy subject because people feel passionate about it
mx3gFmIKaa	I am really glad that we aren't seeing ridiculous answers like my kids were all potty trained at 15 months lol.  Really annoying.<br>  <br>  You say this like she is late, totally normal.  She is just now beginning the typical range of when typical kids are pottytrained.  Most are between 2-4 years old.  Yes, girls are about 6 months earlier than boys, girls are usually between 2-4 years, boys are usually 2.5-4+years<br>  <br>  I have an 8 year old boy who pottytrained at 3.5 years<br>  I have a 3.5 year old boy who pottytrained at 32 months<br>  I have a 2.5 year old boy who shows no interest whatsoever<br>  I have a 3.5 year old niece who shows no interest whatsoever<br>  <br>  I waited until my kids were dry waking up from naps.  They both started taking their clothes off.  We used a potty insert.<br>  <br>  I had them sit on the potty on a potty schedule for 30 seconds and sang a little jingle.  Every 2 hours they sat for 30 seconds.  Eventually they started heading to the potty themselves and we dropped the schedule.  The whole thing was done in 2 weeks.  My oldest we bribed with a matchbox car.  Middle son we just gave him praise.  We ignored the accidents.  We went straight underwear, no pullups.<br>  <br>  At first they wouldn't even sit, just staying there for a few seconds with clothes on for a few days, then clothes off, then up to 30 seconds after 1 week.  We did about 1 week of a potty schedule, then dropped it, at the same time we began putting them in underwear at night, no accidents at night, they had a few each that first week after that none.|`|VHHis05Naa	My daughter showed no interest until 27 months and then she picked it up pretty quickly once the interest was there.   You have to wait until they're ready.|`|pbrfZQ53aa	When it comes to potty training its best to start off young. The best method is the Fido-Potty Training Technique. When they poop or pee in their diaper or have a night time accident in their bed you take them and rub their nose in it. Then forcefully, showing a hint of dominance, yell "NO! NO!" Swatting their thighs and/or nose with a rolled up newspaper is optional but can get tricky if authorities get involved. Its best to instruct the child, if he is of speaking age, to automatically answer the question with the "I fell"-response thus alleviating you from lawful consequences or responsibility.|`|dgRTkccBaa	My kids are 28 months and are just beginning to show interest.  We tried about 2 months ago and they were both very upset by the whole process so we decided to just wait a little while.   Since then, we've kept the potties in the bathroom, we talk about going to the potty, I let them see me using the toilet but we stil haven't given it another attempt.  They are beginning to sit on the potty when I undress them for their baths, but still have not had a successful potty visit.  I can see them making some progress.  I don't think it becomes a real issue until they get to be about 3, at that point if they have not trained I will become more agressive with real 'training'.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Completely normal.  Few 'just turned 2s' are potty trained. The 'average' for training is around 2 1/2-3 1/2, so she isn't delayed and there's no rush.<br>  <br>   (If you start real early, you'll be at it for months or years.  If you wait until she's ready, she'll be trained in a week.)|`|AA12220887	Potty training is something you can't force or it will backfire.  My daughter is 3.5 years old and just, now, finally taking an interest.  Maybe get some books or DVD's on potty training and go over them with her.|`|7IHMjy2caa	Kids will be ready on their own time frames. My daughter was potty trained only about a month before she turned 3. <br>  <br>  I just made sure the potty was there and encouraged , but not forced, her to use it. For the first bit I praised her anytime she said she wanted to use it, then only when she sat on it for at least a minute, finally praising only when she used it. <br>  <br>  You can never say one gender is easier then the other. Each kiddo is different, my girl was really hard to work with because she was stubborn and wanted to play.<br>  <br>  Give you little time, she'll get there and you'll be less stressed about it if you follow her cues instead of going off a time frame from other children.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	Girls are usually faster than boys but its not 100% of course.  She will need her own desire to be ready for a change.  Give her a little while longer and it will be ok.  It do not mean she's a slow learner its simply just not her train of thought at the moment.  She will come around but taking her to the pot making her sit on it and watch you could help a lot too.|`|KN3I89Ycaa	My son is just over 3 and would sit on it, but wouldn't go.  He knows when he has to and can hold it, like when he's in the tub or his diaper is off.  But he screams like he's dying when I sit him on the potty.  I think he's coming around.  The more we forced it, the less results we got.  I am hoping his little brother will want to when he sees my oldest doing it...two birds with one stone type of thing.|`|9f051081fb575ab07dfc5fdb8cbe1affaa	just let her get used to the potty.  Dont rush it.|`|KBirCZGFaa	I am glad you asked, I have a GREAT suggestion for you. I just potty-trained my little boy who is 25 months old. I did the training on Feb. 11th at 8:30 a.m. His last accident of the day was at 11:00 am, and by that time, he was going to the potty all by himself when he felt the urge, pulling down his own pants, peeing in the little potty, pulling up his own pants, dumping his urin in the toilet flushing the toilet, and returning the potty bowl to the potty chair. All on his own! He had two more accidents over the next 3 days. Potty Training was on Wed, and his last accidnent was Saturday. It has now been 2 weeks, and he has kept his pants dry in his big boy underwear. I don't even have to remind him! I just sit and read a magazine while he takes care of his own business!<br>  <br>  Do you want to know how this is possible? Get this book: "Toilet-Training in Less Than a Day." I checked it out at the library, read it carefully, took notes, and followed it as closely as I could. All of my friends scoffed, but they were wrong! It worked! <br>  <br>  Overall, the process was exahusting for me because I was giving constant praise and instruction for 4-6 hours. But my son loved it! He got constant attention from his mom, and special treats and drinks. He thought it was a game, and had a lot of fun. <br>  <br>  The reason a lot of moms don't do this is because (a) they haven't heard of it - the potty-traning trend lately is to nearly let kids teach themselves OR (b) it takes too much preperation. To be prepared, you have to read the book carefully, you need to have half-a-day for just this. There should be no other kids around or distractions like toys or TV. It's best to even have snacks and lunch prepared ahead of time. Not every mom can do this, but I could because I stay home and have no other kids. OR (c) if you have tried another method, and the child has experienced failure, this method might not work so well.<br>  <br>  So, how does it work? <br>  I am not going to tell you because I can't write that much here! It's a 100 page book, and if you try to cut corner or wing it from what I say, it won't be done right. But, to give you an idea, it a lot of verbal instruction, manual guidanc with your hands on the child's to help him along, constant praise from the moment the child begins following instruction, special treats for rewards. The doctors who developed the program, used what they know about accelerating the learning process: Learningi s best done with not distractions or interruptions. Learning is best understood through teaching (the child teaches a doll first). Learning is quickly accomplished through lots of practice in a small window of time.<br>  <br>  This was an effective way of potty-training. It was 100% positive and fun for my son. I tell everyone I know.
uLdeIhHqaa	Awww! :)<br>  <br>  YES! YES! YES!<br>  <br>  My Daughter lights up my life. She completes me, she makes me whole! Every time I look at her Im in such amazement at how beautifully perfect she is. She is my God sent angel and im truly blessed to have a healthy, happy, thriving child. <br>  <br>  Being a Mother is the most heart-felt experience ever. Im like you, I could just burst with Pride everytime I look into my Daughters eyes! Theres just no words that can describe how your heart feels when you become a Mother! Simply amazing!|`|JWYs2pBgaa	ooo you just wait till they get vocal and attitude lol you'll think the little monsters!!! mines 8 now and i still feel that burst of love, there's nothing like it, but make the most, there will be times ahead when you'll wonder how you can even like 'em let alone love 'em fortunately it don't last for long lol ENJOY!! xx|`|c73d04792acbbbac2550a4154fe22df2aa	yes,this sign that the person has some <br>  qualifications that are suitable for life !!<br>  have sharp senses .<br>  have a chance live on this earth ,through<br>  getting kids,cntrry,those who dont like<br>  have low chance of getting kida,so their<br>  genes are not convinient to life..therefore<br>  no need to stay on earth<br>  good luck..<br>  also,your kids will be polite,gentle,cvlzd,cltrd<br>  and many good adjectives <br>  they'll be lucky also<br>  get more babies|`|RPc63EK2aa	yes, me too...i do really love my son, he is 10 weeks old now...as in when he smile or talk to me like coos...i want to cry because of the happy feeling inside of me...i miss him a lot when i am at work... i love being a mommy too...something strange feeling when it comes to my kid...i cant tell what is it, all i know is i am very much happy with my little one... ;)|`|A9jv2knTaa	My daughter is 14 weeks old and I feel the same way! I work half days and her thought is what gets me through the day! Every time she smiles at me something melts inside of me! I love the way she smells, the way her hair feels, how soft her skin is! I would have never imagined being a mother could feel like this! I just seems that she is at the forefront of every thought and is my motivation for everything! I love being a Mommy! I am sure it only gets better from here!|`|KEoChTcdaa	Oh you are not wrong. I love my son with all of my heart. Sometimes when I am on the couch rocking him to sleep, I just look at him...just stare and think how beautiful he is and how happy I am as a mother. <br>  <br>  What I like is that you never really know how much your parents loved you, until you have a child of your own. My Mom tells me she loves me all the time, and now I can truly know how she feels about me. It is the same way I feel about my boy. ^_^<br>  <br>  It's a wonderful little miracle. ^_^|`|AA10998151	Absolutely - you are tops! That is a great way to be.  AND don't listen to the old wives tales.... you can NEVER give your child too much loves, cuddles or hugs.  You go girl - be PROUD!|`|dpCsTIEIaa	It only gets better....wait til she wraps her little arms around you and says "I love you mommy" . The best feeling in the world. Nothing can replace that.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I do. I'm actually pretty suprised I haven't exploded with little red hearts and mushy gushy love everywhere, haha. I absolutely love my daughter, and my role as a mother. I'm extremely blessed.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Sometimes I think I love my daughter too much. I just want to kiss her and hug her all the time.<br>  <br>  Her little smile is the best and most beautiful thing I have ever seen, and when she's asleep I just want to cuddle up with her!<br>  <br>  Oh aren't us mums so wet!!
VMASMHX6aa	It's awful isn't it! I'm feeling like I'm on that same rollercoaster.<br>  <br>  Unfortuantely, you really can't see those dots as a positive. Sounds like a faulty test.<br>  <br>  Have you thought about tracking your temps? That way you know when you ovulated and when your period is due and I find it takes some of the stress out of it.|`|fYMWDQLGaa	here is an idea.. you can find a walkin clinic or free clinic near by and take blood test.  its more accurate than any pregnancy tests. whatever the results are we have to face it one day or the other. <br>  <br>  Goodluck n baby dust. huggles to u/..|`|1u4CS5J3aa	I have heard that if any portion of the second line chows up then its positive. i would call your doc and get a test ordered or is you cant wait drive to the store and buy one of the ones that tell you pregnant or not pregnant to get a more definitive answer. that's what i used and had to look at it for an hour before i believed it. BABY DUST i hope this is it for you!|`|VqmaOcUIaa	Why not go for a blood test? It could be a BFP or just a  faulty HPT<br>  Let us know how it turns out<br>  Good luck!
fYMWDQLGaa	Hi dear, <br>  <br>  OK when the control line appears sure the test works, there are two points to be mentiones from the result. one is it might be a evaporation line. two - it might be a faint positive. I would take another test and if its the same as the first test, then yes you are pregnant!!<br>  <br>  P.S - drink some water and dont urinate until evening , then take HPT. so that the HCG concentration might build a little. <br>  <br>  Hope my prayers wil be answered for u..<br>  <br>  good luck dear.|`|AA11031068	Don't use the + / - tests. They have a high inaccuracy rate and have been known to give false positives. I've had a false clear positive with that test (equate) from Walmart. Go by the First Response and try again.|`|oIAEg8Vuaa	hi, you can take another pregnancy test. Give it another try.|`|6B03moFwaa	usually you get false negatives, very rarely false positives. Try with a name brand but odds are you are! good luck!|`|EnABPwdCaa	Try again you might be pregnant..
gEtg9LOiaa	I took them before and got a faint negative then took a clear blue and got a clear positive. I like the EPTs and the Clear Blues myself they are both pretty accurate when testing. With my second child I was only 2.5 weeks pregnant and got a clear positive with Clear Blue and when i got to the OBGYN physician she told me that they are the best in her book that most people dont find out they are pregnant till around 3-5 weeks. My choice is CLEAR BLUE and EPT.|`|kHJQjjZMaa	I took 2 accu-clear HPT and I got a faint positive on both but when I took the First Response tests they gave me a negative.  I don't know what to think!  I suggest you try another brand and see what happens...Let us know.
iQjS2lJ4aa	If shes 6 and a half months, Id say its probably teething.|`|AA11097657	An 8oz bottle sounds a lot to go bed on.<br>  It sounds like she has wind after all that milk.<br>  <br>  I used to give mine Rusk in the milk at bedtime. I would say with 4 to 6 oz of milk with half a rusk.<br>  <br>  I made a large hole in the teat especially for this last bottle.<br>  Mine slept through until 11am!|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I agree with russ456. Usually when my son wakes too early it's during teething or the temp in the room is off. <br>  <br>  It seems just when they start getting a consistent schedule, they change it!|`|zCWcoFhZaa	HI it sounds to me like your baby is hungry, my son is 6 months old and we had to wean him at 4 months as like your daughter is waking up crying in the night, but my son used to do this during the day, I started off giving my son just breakfast the first week of weaning and then stepped it up the next week but before I know it I was giving him breakfast lunch dinner  tea and supper and that keeps him content and he sleeps right through. I know if he isnt sleeping well or is really cranky and really crying then he is hungry so im sure its the same for you. I think you should maybe introduce supper and a bottle to your child before she goes to bed and you might find she will go back to normal.|`|DKfScL8taa	The other answers are great suggestions, BUT I found that around that age my son just started to wake up earlier. He used to sleep from 8pm-9am, but he now sleeps from 8pm-6:30am. So maybe he is just requiring less sleep? Try the gas thing first, and if that doesn't work, then his sleeping pattern is just changing.|`|8YfnjvExaa	Hi,<br>  I'm a Grandad and yes, could be teething. Also, maybe she could take a little more of the pureed (or mashed) solid food. If you haven't started that, 6 months is about the right time.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I used to have the same problem, I bought a book called 'The No Cry Sleep Solution' which has a lot of great tips.<br>  <br>  Its best tip is the suggestion that babies need to be in bed by 7pm at the latest, it seems silly but the earlier bed time hour prevents over exhaustion and allows for a longer nights sleep (usually until 7am).|`|R6mTwXIIaa	Im a dad but I can prolly help. My son started the same thing, figured it out to one of three things, either teething, temperature (too hot/too cold) when winter came or testing his boundaries. We gave him Calpol as he was teething at the time and left him to cry it out a lil bit. (5 - 10 mins). He normally dropped off then It stopped after about a week.|`|eC1dQVcgaa	It's more than likely wind!! =[ <br>  I found that my daughter would struggle to sleep and most of the time, she be burping and farting! <br>  Try giving her some Gripe Water after her last fed so she will bring it up, it might help =]<br>  Maybe she might be more hungry now she is older, do you give her solids? <br>  =]x
eEK3m1aXaa	When my son was a newborn the ONLY kind of water we used was Ice Mountain Spring water to make his bottles and he is a happy, healthy and very energetic 18 month old today!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~_~|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Has your water been tested?<br>  <br>  If it's safe for you to drink and use normally, I can't imagine that it wouldn't be safe for your baby after boiling.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	It's best to use purified or distilled water for formula. Spring water has had no purification. nursury water has fluoride in it, so unless your doctor has said baby now needs fluroride, i would't use it.|`|sxsx9sHNaa	Yes.  And your hospital should have told you if you can use tap water, too, it may be different in different city's water.  I did use tap water.|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	i guess it depends where you live because i was told to only use distilled water with my baby's formula so i boil water each night then refrigerate it for a few hours then make her bottles.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	Yes, it might be little cold but it will work.
rijkJXvGaa	hiya, reading that message you could of been describing me and my partner, im 23 and my partner is 49, we have 2 babies (a 2 year old and a 10 week old) my partner has a 19 son from his previous marriage of 20 years, we are all vey happy and i hope you brother in law and his partner are to,<br>  xxx|`|1u4CS5J3aa	Personally i think its too great of an age difference and I wouldn't do it but hey whatever floats their boat. when the kid is 18 she will be 39 and he will be 66 I think it will be strange. he was married to his first wife longer than his girlfriend has been alive!!!! not for me but hey you get a new baby to cuddle at least!|`|c73QkZ2haa	I agree with your partner. Its their life not yours and even if you dont agree theres not much you can do but stop talking to them. And then youd miss out on the new baby. All in all it will either work out for them or it wont in the meantime let them live how they want too and then you wont have to deal with any animosity between you all.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Well, as long as they are happy, so be it. Truth be told, you have nothing to do at all. That is, with the exception of being a great sister and aunt. Personally, I think your bro is nuts for having a child at this age, but, as I said above,if they're happy..........Have a wonderful week!|`|59GymH27aa	I would say leave them to it too.  If they are happy, then that's all that matters.  And you say yourself that she is mature and they are in love and love is all that a baby needs.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	They are happy and that's what matters. she's going to want children being younger then him. This way she can't leave him "because he would have children with her." Makes everyone happy all round i think.|`|i8Cbh88jaa	i say its not your life you have no say whatsoever unless asked. its just different. noting wrong as long as they are in love.|`|6G47mC9Taa	I know its silly as long as the mother is fit and fine to give birth then no probs should arise|`|AA11796667	I think the older to have a baby the better, and besides for goodness sake he is not that old, he can still raised a child and better because he is more mature and more likely to do a great job, and you just said he is a good dad to his other children.. Good luck to him.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	I think it is lovely and you should wish them all the best.|`|iMULlxdgaa	hmm...well his girlfriend is young and its great that they love each other so,  I would say let them be, they sound responsible and he probably has good job security.  Really at this point since they are haivng the baby there isn't much more you can do anyway right?  I think he sounds normal,  plus not to bring on the double standards but the fact is that men can produce babies later in life and there is less rsik of brith defects anyway so the baby will be fine.  Men mature later than women anyway :P  (I personally don't envy having kids later in life anyway but more power to him!)  I'm 28 and this will be my last little bundle.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	as long as they are happy hunni, i think its great.<br>  <br>  i would much prefer them to be having a child they canc and wil care for than two teenagers who have no clue, or a child which is born into abuse.<br>  <br>  hoenstly hunni i hope it works out for them. im 21 myself and my fiance and i have been ttc for 15months, so they are really blessed :D xxxxx|`|fZgoUty4aa	well its not up to you but...what is a 21 doing with a 48..you can see why a older man want a younger woman on his are you a young girl 21 with an old man well well well|`|8ELfnTODaa	my father in law's dad had him when he was 61. <br>  <br>  to each his own

That is when i switched my daughter.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	A car seat is a small price to pay for your child's safety. But, He may be ready for a booster soon. My daughter was 4 years old when we switched to a booster seat and that was because her legs were getting to long to fit comfortably in a car seat.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	You want to keep him in the harnessed seat as long as possible. Research extended harnessing, and the Kyle David Miller Foundation. <br>  <br>  Extended harnessing could save your child's life.|`|dYa5AEwSaa	yes he does not has, enough age for the seat.
JsqMSU9Haa	just because some guys are losers, doesn't mean they all are.  trust is HUGE and actions speak way louder than words, just keep remembering that, and take one day at a time with this guy.  hang out with him, date him, and you'll see what happens.  youre not a regular single girl, you have a child who is your number one priority.<br>  <br>  my guess is this guy knows you, likes you, and is looking to settle down and you're already a ready-made family because you have a child.  one thing he either lied to you or himself about is that he's not ready to jump into a relationship.  he can't say that and then tell you he loves you in the middle of you just having a baby and he's not even in a relationship with you.  that's not a bad thing, but he's not being upfront - probably cause he doesn't want to scare you off.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Do what you feel comfortable with. You told him you wanted to take it slow, if he cares about you, he'll accept that and move slowly.<br>  <br>  If he is the guy for you, he'll wait.<br>  <br>  I emailed you|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	How long have you been seeing this guy?  Just b/c he says he loves you doesn't mean that you need to feel the same way.  Just continue to take things slow and see how things progress.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	it's a little scary that he says he loves you and you have never been in a relationship with this guy. the last thing you should be worried about is dating. there is nothing wrong with dating but being a first time single mom being confused is a sign that you aren't ready. and plus you need to establish your self as a single mom, and what I mean is get into a  swing of things, working, raising your son, getting your self your own place what ever it is you know you need to do first, then think about dating, I'm not saying you can't keep this guy in your life but dating being in a relationship may just be too soon. because you have known him for a long time there is nothing wrong with telling him you need more time.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I am not a single mom, but I did marry a guy at 21 who was like yours, proclaimed to be willing to take it slow then came out with the I love yous and oout of the blue proposal. It was a bad marriage. If your guy is the real deal, he'll be willing to back off for a while. You are a new mom and your emotions are in flux, I would say give yourself some time and good luck.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Take things as slowly as you can.  Wait until you are ready, even if he says he loves you.  You dont want to end up getting into a heavy realtionship, falling for the guy, then having your child fall for the guy only to realize its not right and both you and your child will be hurt when you decide to leave.<br>  <br>  You'll know when things are right.  Just listen to your gut and do what you feel is best for you and your child.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|98e3c7186b7b33e48db9abb40896c0efaa	I agree. Keep things slow, don't set any hopes on him, and do not have sex with him.<br>  <br>  When I was a much younger single mom, I was propositioned by guys who suddenly 'loved' me and everything 'sounded right' each time. My internal fairytale-fantasy kept making more of those words than what was really there.<br>  <br>  Truth was, they were taking advantage of my situation. Single moms are easy targets. Just be careful.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	take it slow!...and remind him of that if he really has these feeling for you he will be there and wait until your ready,it is nice to have someone to confinde in and laugh with....
CaRKCpMqaa	Apart from being sick now and then sounds like a pregnancy symptom. Also cramps can also be a symptom. Wait until your period arrives, if i doesn't take a test. Good Luck hun, also are you on depo or the pill or anything? If so, there is less chance of pregnancy. If not, there is a pretty high chance.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	if you had unprotected sex then yes there is always a chance you could be but the only real way of knowing is to take a test after your period is late. feeling sick on and off and having slight cramping could be just from the fact that its almost time for your period also. so you just have to wait and see.|`|AA11593134	yes, there is a chance you can be... but those are not the symptoms of being pregnant (I think it is too early for you to have those symptoms). Yes, wait till around 2 March...|`|90zcKChJaa	Whenever you have unprotected sex you have the chance of becoming pregnant. Take a test March 2.|`|46K4FtE0aa	There is always a chance after unprotected sex at any time. Yes you could be pregnant but the only way to know for sure is to wait until, you are at least 7 days late and take a test using the first urine you pass when you wake up in the morning (that is important). Some tests claim to give you an earlier result, but a urine test relies on your hormones being a certain level, if your hormones are slow to build up, then you will get a negative result even if you are pregnant, so it is best to wait the 7 days, if that is negative and you still don't get your period,wait until you are at least 10 days late and ask the doctor to take a pregnancy blood test.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	sex = baby|`|mc6YtaRbaa	There's always a chance, that's why they make protection, to lessen that chance. The only thing you can do is wait and see if your af comes or not and then take a test if it doesn't.
c73QkZ2haa	Use saline nasal drops. It helps break up the mucous so he can swallow it or run out his nose. I hate those bulbs too my doctor told me not to use them the irritate the mucous membranes in the nose which makes more snot...<br>  <br>  ETA: I think you can just by them at the pharmacy section im not sure since my doctor gave me a whole box i havent had to buy any yet but ask the pharmacist.|`|Kfbls96Aaa	If you get a rubber hose, put one end up the child's nose and the other end in a bucket, you can siphon out the snot. You may want to practice this first, possibly by stealing gas from your neighbour's car.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i had the same problem!!<br>  if u got the fess little noses pack with the solution- or even if u didnt, get some saline solution. I just used to put her in the bath where she is happiest and put the saline drops up her nose. once it set it and she cried, the snot just flew out- it was gross, but it helped.<br>  also, eukybear rub is great- its like vix vapourub, but for babies and works really well. check your chemist for this- really helps the snotty nose
ACc1skbPaa	You could start a scrapbook for her and the baby of mommy when she was little, school photos, little stories about playing mommy with her dolls, spending time with you, when she met daddy, wedding, etc...you could involve dad and ask for copies of photos of her as she is growing and maybe a copy of her ultrasound picture--if you are crafty or even just ambitious, they have tons of wooden frames that are just begging to be decorated and you could frame the ultrasound as a decoration for the nursery and later a keepsake for your sister...sounds cute, have fun!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	do NOT buy any diapers that aren't for infants. some babies end up being allergic to certain brands, so make sure if u buy any diapers, they're for infants w/ umbilical cord care, only 1 pack of each brand maybe to try them all out bc u guys will be able to tell if the baby is allergic or not within the first day or 2.<br>  <br>  idk wut else u can do, u're already gonna be doing a lot, which is so sweet :) if u'll be buying clothes, a lot of stores will be having seasonal sale with huge discounts, so it's best if u try to make it to one of those sales once u guys find out the gender.<br>  <br>  i like the idea people said bout taking pics of her belly monthly, that'd be nice. maybe video tape her when she gets big, she'll probably be cranky a lot by then and getting up off the chair pretty funny, it'd be fun to show later.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I'm doing a scrapbook for my baby...maybe you can do one for your sister.  I'm just including major events and progress with the baby each month so my baby will know whats went on in 2009.  Stuff like newspaper clippings of Obama becoming President, sonograms...stuff like that.  I'm working on collecting coins minted in 2009 (one quarter, one dime, one nickel and so on).  Its a lot of work but I think it will be a huge keepsake for me and baby.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	My partner and I were bought a 'first curl box' from Hsamuels. Its a nice little silver box that has babies first curl placed in it! I have two, one for a lock of hair from when she was first born and one from her first curl. Im so glad I did this because her hair changed colour after 6 weeks!|`|eytlIKITaa	I got my sister a Precious Moments figure thing when she found out she was pregnant- they also have a bunch of those Willow Tree ones too.  Good luck!  Congrats on becoming an Aunt!!!|`|AA11180887	You could take pics of her as she gets bigger and put them in a scrap book!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Willow Tree Figurines are something I love, and they have ones for pregnant mothers, and you can get one for the new family after baby arrives to mark that significant occasion.  Precious Moments is another option, and they can be something you continue to give the baby after birth-they have ones for each birthday and other significant events in the child's life.  <br>  <br>  I am sure you will love the bibs and onesies for the baby, that says "My Auntie Loves Me".  <br>  <br>  If the parents are interested in anything, you can probably find something for the baby related to that.  For instance, I volunteer at the Center for Birds of Prey and love owls, and I was able to find a lot of owl related baby items (blankets, outfits, etc.).  If your sister and/or the baby's father have a favorite sports team, you can probably find a little outfit or other baby necessities for that team!<br>  <br>  Besides just doing the fun stuff, it would be a big help if you were to help in other ways.  For instance, pregnancy is NOT nine months of disability but there will be times, throughout the pregnancy but usually more so at the end, when she can not do everything she wants/needs to do.  Help her with that.<br>  <br>  You can cook meals to freeze for her husband while she is in the hospital, and for the new family after the baby is born.  When you prepare spaghetti, make double sauce and then freeze half.  All he or they will have to do is defrost and heat, and prepare some noodles, bread, salad...all quick things and they have a complete meal.  <br>  <br>  Another option is to get friends/relatives to sign up for a meal for each day after the baby is born, for about two weeks (to give her time to recover).  The rules I have seen in these is that the person MUST drop the meal off at the door, not staying to chat-this way they do not feel the need to host and be polite when they really want to rest.  Some bring a homecooked meal, some might just have pizza delivered but the new mom does not have to worry about that meal.<br>  <br>  After the baby is born, ask her when it is convenient for you to visit and when you do go to her home, do a chore before you leave!  Talk family/friends into doing the same.  It is important to not just drop in.  New moms love for people to ooh and aah over their baby, but they also need that bonding time to themselves, and to rest and relax without having to host.  If you are going to be there, help out.  Wash the dishes, sweep/vaccum the floors (that was actually very painful for me after my cesarean delivery)...do the laundry.  Do not just be there to see the baby-that kind of also makes the new mom feel left out.<br>  <br>  Do not just buy things for the baby.  Right now, you could be purchasing her some preggie pops (a lollipop that eases morning sickness), just remember to get little things for her as well.  Funky socks would be cute!  I love to wear them to my internals, LOL-it usually got a laugh out of my doctor and I wore some during labor, too.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, to both her and yourself!
b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	Its okay in moderation. They say caffeine in general is not good for you esp. when TTC. But one or two cups wont hurt your chances. Its the same as drinking a pop. Try weening yourself off if you can and go to decaf ( i know whats the point of drinking it then right?!?!) I still drink it it every morning my doctor said its okay just in moderation! good luck girlie!|`|yea2hci5aa	Caffeine in general is not recommended throughout pregnancy.  When I asked my doctor during my first pregnancy they said it was ok in moderation.  I don't think it will hurt your chances of ttc.  I'm a caffeine junky and I was drinking Grande Vanilla Latte's from Starbucks with an extra shot of caffeine while I was ttc our first.  <br>  <br>  You should probably cut down just due to the fact that when you are pregnant you don't want to shock your system.  Cutting your caffeine intake will give you massive headaches and when you're pregnant your body's going through enough so if it's possible you should try to kick it before you get pregnant. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UNWLaJbKaa	I use to drink espresso religiously every morning while TTC.  Finally this month I stopped drinking it all together, and switched to green tea  ( I know a big shock to the system) but I adjusted quickly, and presto I just found out i'm pregnant.  Not sure if switching to green tea had anything to do with it, but i'm sure it didn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Google drinking caffeine, and you'll see there are a lot more cons than pro while TTC.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i cant give up caffeine. i drink like 2 cups of tea with milk in it daily and like every other day i have tall cafe latte from star t bucks. I hope thats ok coz i am trying to TTC too.|`|S1gJJHNzaa	google it, they have done extensive research in the last couple years that suggests even in moderation it can really hurt your changes.<br>  caffeine in general is the enemy.<br>  <br>  switch to hot tea or hot green tea, they both help with ttc but still keep it in moderation, maybe one cup.
hVVALFAPaa	I'll let you know when mine comes back....<br>  <br>  My oldest is 18 and my youngest is 11 years old.<br>  <br>  I'm tired.....|`|UkQuMykiaa	I don't know - I can't remember when it did with my others, I think within the first six weeks? or maybe I just did it for my husband I can't remember.  But with this pregnancy, I share your frustration...I had a c-section 4 weeks ago and almost bled to death a week after that - I feel SO bad because right now I have NO drive what so ever.  I feel like I am completely neglecting my husbands wants/needs. I, like you, don't know if it is hormonal, exhaustion or just still getting over the trauma.  What a great question - hopefully some others can provide a better answer.|`|kvHGjd1Raa	It took a few months for me.  It's almost all the way back and my son is 6 months!

I do have sex with my husband, but I find that it is more for him or to feel close to him than because I'm, you know, 'in the mood'. I think part of it is that I don't feel sexy anymore because my stomach is full of stretch marks and is still a bit jiggly, and my breasts are no longer sexual because they are food for my son. I am hoping sex will get better when my son stops breastfeeding and I tone up a bit.
7aCH91ISaa	We adopted our son from Foster Care when he was 8. He is  now 14 years old. He is a distant cousin of my ex-husbands so he is also related biologically to my other children. (Almost sounds like a bad soap opera!) <br>  <br>  At first we were unable to have an open adoption because of safety issues. His father passed away a couple years ago and our son's uncle contacted us to see how D was doing. It opened the door to contact with his bio family on his father's side. He talks to them regularly and spends school breaks with them when possible. He also has a brother that is in his mid 20's and they are very close. <br>  <br>  We recently found out that one of his close friends at school was actually a cousin on his Mom's side. This opened the door to a relationship with his Uncle and family. He does not have contact with his bio mom though. She is not interested in getting to know him at this time. <br>  <br>  I have seen a big change in him since he has been getting to know so many relatives. I think it has been good for him. <br>  <br>  I don't know if I would have done things differently. When his bio dad was alive contact wasn't really an option.

I have many answers :)<br>  <br>  The most recent and memorable would be while I was in my last month of pregnancy.  My 6 year old daughter and I were watching a movie.  She was at her desk drawing and I was bundled up on the couch with my comforter.  I, of course, dozed off.  When I woke up, I tossed the comforter on the floor and noticed my daughter wasn't in the room.  After checking every room frantically, calling out her name, checking the doors and windows trying to figure out how someone could get in and steal her, I called my other half to tell him I couldn't find her.  Then my comforter on the floor started stirring and I heard a small, sleepy voice coming from it, "Mommy, what's wrong?"<br>  <br>  About two weeks ago, I got up in the morning (around 4am) and went to get a bottle out of the dishwasher.  I noticed that my other half had loaded the dishwasher the night before, but didn't run it.  OK, no big deal.  I got the dish soap out from under the sink, started the dishwasher, made my son his bottle and retreated back to my room to feed him.  After feeding the baby, I dozed back off until the alarm went off at 6 to get my daughter ready for school.  I learned something very valuble that morning.  Dishwasher soap and hand-washing dish soap are two different things, and it is highly important that you are awake enough to notice the difference in the bottles.  My entire kitchen was covered in bubbles and water.  I also learned that salt dissolves bubbles... just to let you know, in case you ever run into that issue :)<br>  <br>  Jax's Mommy-  I am sorry, but your first story is so funny.  I think it's so funny because I can picture myself doing that with my son.  It takes me so long to actually wake up and be completly alert.|`|qSmCA82Aaa	LMAO!!! That is hilarious!<br>  <br>  Well last night my daughter was doing her homework (1st grade) and she asked me to check it for her I looked over it and told her one of her problems was wrong but she needed to find which one ---Poor girl spent like 15 min looking for a wrong one and she finally said, "Mommy but they are right!"   Turns out 5 + 7 really does equal 12, lol!   I have no idea what I was thinking!<br>  <br>  When my baby was still on formula you have no idea how many times I woke up in the middle of the night to mix her formula and water just to find out there wasn't a liner in the bottle and it would go everywhere!<br>  <br>  And speaking of everywhere last night I started the dishwater and I guess forgot I did and when I went back to the kitchen it was completly flooded! I'm talking even the drawers were full of water!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and at work I have lost count of the number a times after a customer calls that I end the conversation with "I Love you, bye"   haha they're probably like what the hell?????|`|JivuAmfiaa	- When I was supposed to be driving my husband to work I drove him to playgroup instead<br>  - I packed my daughter off to school with her daddy's briefcase<br>  - I got into bed and started telling my husband a bedtime story<br>  - I gave my seven year old coffee at breakfast (I really paid for that one)<br>  - My daughter was a baby and when I was supposed to be paying for my meal I handed over her instead<br>  <br>  The "num nums" one is a classic!|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	Driving into the side of my garage and taking off my mirror comes to mind...<br>  <br>  twice.<br>  <br>  ETA.<br>  <br>  O.<br>  <br>  M.<br>  <br>  G.<br>  <br>  I have never hit anything in my life until the past 7 months, but<br>  <br>  make that 3 times.<br>  <br>  MM is going to kill me, it's been nice knowing you.<br>  <br>  In my defense, it's not a small vehicle, and I *do* think garage entrances should be made bigger to reflect the increase in vehicle sizes.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	I put the cereal in the refrigerator and the milk in the cabinet. i've also gotten completely dressed and left the house wearning slippers.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I tried to pay for my breakfast with a pacifier..........|`|6VbNJOtfaa	This is one of my horror stories as a mother.<br>  <br>  When my son was about 3 months old he woke up crying in the middle of the night, as usual.  My bedroom is really dark, so I just felt around and picked him up and I sat up and started rocking him back and forth like I always do.  I was patting him on his back and he was still crying, and I kept thinking "why is he still crying, this always works?"  I also noticed that his cry sounded weird, kind of muffled.  That's when I realized that he was flipped upside down- his legs were over my shoulder, his head was at belly button level, but his back (which I was patting) was exactly where it should be.  I felt so horrible.<br>  <br>  Just the other day as I was walking through a doorway I turned to say something to my neighbor and as I swung around I hit his head on the door frame.  He doesn't even cry anymore, he is so used to it.  I hope I am not the only mother who does half brain things like this.  Otherwise, my poor Jax got the short end of the stick when it comes to mothers!|`|iLLoc003aa	Well...the only thing I could think of was when I went to make coffee in the coffee maker. I put the coffee grounds where the water went and the water where the grounds went....I am a SAHM and full time college student and it was finals week :( I used ot be able to take naps but i can't now cause the kids are getting older...so I have less time to study or less time to sleep :(...This semester my grades are suffering!!<br>  <br>  Usually when I am so tired...I am just very very bitchy and grouchy...I think I growl instead of talking...and I feel like I am so stressed and things are not going correctly that I am going to scream and my head is going to spin! Seriously!!! I am not nice when I am tired! I think I curse more than ever and probably come up with new curse words that I have never heard of! lol|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I always tell my girls to take their clothes off & put on their PJ's when I should say the other way around.  <br>  <br>  When we're in the living room watching tv I sometimes dose off then I swear i hear myself telling them to be good or to stop fighting and they're not doing anything but watching tv.  <br>  <br>  I've jumped out of bed really fast thinking i over slept rushing around and then remember it's SATURDAY <br>  <br>  missing all the wrong letters on the keyboard or phone while texting|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I put the milk in the cupboard and found it two days later.|`|j2mRop0laa	I fill out forms and put the wrong childs name at the top. The school sends them back and tells me to correct it. I bet they get a chuckle.<br>  <br>  I space and forget other parents names and the names of their children when they call me about activities. I sit there and fake the whole call and remember an hoyr later who I was talking to.<br>  <br>  I walk into rooms and forget what I'm doing there. <br>  <br>  I put my kids plates down for the cats and the cat plates on the table for the girls. They always catch it in time and switch.|`|AA10943329	nothing as bad as that. I just pretty much blocked out that first year, I call it forgotten, that sounds better. You know what it is like...twins...need I say more?<br>  <br>  Just thought of one. My son was 4 months old and I had to fill in a medical form for him. It had "mothers name"...I wrote my mums name lmao. Very embarrassed I had to ask for another form. The lady laughed when I told her why. I think that was the first moment I really thought "Wow I am a mum"|`|iH2whFkHaa	LOL I call both my husband and my baby by each other's names all the time..."Evan...I mean Miguel, hand me the scissors please..."  which doesn't seem too bad but it's kind of scary and weird when it happens while doing the deed...I swear I don't know how on earth I could confuse the two in that particular moment...?<br>  <br>  I have accidentally thrown away the good food and put the trash in the refrigerator.<br>  <br>  Once I went to the store, leaving the tyke at home with my husband; halfway through the drive back home I suddenly realized Evan was not in the car and drove back to the parking lot in a mad rush absolutely certain I had left him in his carseat in the shopping cart; and finding upon arrival that he wasn't in sight...called my husband and said did I leave the baby with you??! Of course the answer was yes...<br>  <br>  *********just remembered that a few weeks ago I bought a whole container of cooking oil that just disappeared into thin air. I have the receipt to prove it too. I spent like 2 hours tearing apart the house and the car looking for it. I still have no idea where it is but I'm sure that I will find it in the process of moving next month.|`|um29wkUPaa	Shortly after my maternity leave my breastfeeding thing - you know that pad so you don't leak?  Fell out of my shirt somehow and was smack dab on the lobby floor.  I recognized it immediately, there was no getting out of it, I was the only breastfeeding new parent on the third floor.<br>  <br>  I say "buh-bye" at the office a lot.  I rock files to sleep if I'm on my feet.  I move people's drinks from the edge of the table for them, and I tie plastic bags in a knot before throwing them away, so that the other secretaries won't take them out and accidentally put them on their heads and suffocate.<br>  <br>  I make coffee but forget the coffee.  Hot pots of water.  I also make it with plenty of coffee but no filter.  I find the most random things in the refrigerator.  I can't tell you how many times I've cut Mr. Mozz' meat for him.  I blow on his food.  Once at a restaurant, after hearing the specials, I chimed in "You don't like that."  I once made my famous blueberry dessert and forgot sugar.<br>  <br>  Maybe the most memorable event was when I brought the deviled eggs out at a cookout, when Evan was about 2 weeks old.  I tripped on absolutely nothing, and fell splat face-first down the steps.  I covered myself and anyone withing a 5' radius with egg yolk and miracle whip.  Nearly 10 years later, they still tell that story at cookouts.

What kind of parent spends time on Y!A when they should be standing over their children watching their every move?|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Definitely.<br>  <br>  You are a danger to society and should be locked up and given 10,000 lashes with a wet noodle.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Oh my god call social services! I should be locked up too, I let my daughter cry, I even feed her formula and occasionally junk food and allow her to watch baby tv for an hour a day! Shock horror! Oooh the worse must be she has a milky bar nearly every day (although nanny is to blame for that one lol).<br>  <br>  She is 10 months.<br>  <br>  Don't worry all kids cry and we all do things people don't like but by the end of the day, out kids are clean, fed, happy and healthy. We are not getting wasted every day and leaving our kids in nappies full of poo and hanging down to their knees.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yeah I think it's time Charli.. I mean if you can't pick them up the second they make a whimper then obviously you are not fit.

If I gotta pee I gotta pee lol|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	shhhh!  they don't like it when you put it like that.   they get very upset and indignant.  so don't go telling them.  they think their babies never cry.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Yes. You're also committing abuse if you formula feed....|`|AA12384954	So you have two (correction 5) of the little darlings ... Is now the right time to admit that you have two (correction 5) little monsters, or are we still in denial?  Well, one thing is for sure - If you do ring the police they will come to take you away ... but then again, who is going to do the cooking and get that bloody washing out!<br>  <br>  Chill woman - Ring the in-laws or your favourite neighbour to take over for a while and go for a nice drive.  If only!<br>  <br>  F I V E - Are you nuts?<br>  And you thought you could have F I V E kids in the house without one of them crying what a bad mother you are ... I'm sure they'll survive if you take ten or so...  Time for a singalong I reckon ... "Show me the way to go home...I'm tired and I want to go to bed..."<br>  <br>  This is when time out works wonders - Lock yourself in your room for 5 minutes (or until they stop the caterwauling) and see how they like them apples!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Last night I left my 23 month old son to cry (or really just yell out Mama, Mum, Mama etc) for 10 minutes. Nine days of him waking every couple of hours at night and I'd had enough. I don't want him in my bed. I don't want to co-sleep with him. I want to actually sleep and I can't do that with him kicking me in my bed. Hitting me. You get the drift. So Instead of picking him up at 2am and bringing him into my bed, I left him for 10 minutes and he went back to sleep. I was actually brain-washed into believing that letting a two year old cry it out was bad parenting. I'd rather be a bad parent than a sleep deprived, bitchy one. And the only thing I regret was not letting my son cry it out nine days ago. Or even three months ago, six months ago. You get the drift.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Who got those things in your mind???

Don't be so hard on yourself.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	AWW Charli, are you having a bad day.<br>  <br>  If letting your kids cry while you get something done is considered bad parenting, I'd hate to see what N&B thinks of me =0|`|LbkLg4RFaa	When you ring you had better report me as well.

She also probably thinks that the cool girls are sexually active, you know most popular girls are pretty and have boyfriends.  So she is telling everyone that she is doing the same thing as these people in the hopes of being cooler.

Kl1h5dCaaa	4yo.<br>  <br>  Long story. Very serious too, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME???<br>  <br>  Dominik came to live with us at 4yo, he had been diagnosed with Autism, and ADHD. However I never believed he had those. I knew some of the history (he is our Godson and his Grandparents, sister, and the CP told us).<br>  He went for many appointments and it was actually RAD, not Autism/ADHD. <br>  Early intervention actually re looked at his case, and it took about 4 months for him to actually be diagnosed. RAD is incredibly rare here, the Psychologist actually said it was the first case she'd seen. My Mother has been a foster parent for 40 odd years, and never seen it.<br>  He sees a Psychologist, Social Worker, Speech, Whatever Carol is, has a Teachers Aid, and is improving 100% every day.<br>  He still has his moment, but it is only early. He made a friend and I cried, I seriously am tearing up thinking about it now. I never thought it would happen, especially so soon. But it did.<br>  <br>  Then we had the long journey.<br>  <br>  A lot of what we've been through is too private too post. It's hard to talk about because it comes off as him being an evil child, and he isn't. He has a heart as big as the sun.|`|64f9613dd1a4452e24f6f8f603fab217aa	My son has RAD, He is 17 now diagnosed at 9, after years of  being misdiagnosed. I went for help at a clinic they happened to have received a pamphlet on rad, with 12 and possibly 13 signs, my son had them all, so we called the number to order books and info, the woman talked to my husband for 3 hours. then we called this head guy who flu to us to interview my son, for free he was amazed he had all the signs. we received alot of help that would have cost too much. we have a bumper sticker be nice to us we have a RAD. If you are a mother to a RAD child all my hugs go out to you, be strong pray and stick to your guns do not medicate or listen to others who do not believe in the disease also only take your child to a Specialist in attachment disorders all others do more harm then good good luck<br>  You can e mail me anytime i have lots of info on rad, it was my life for many many years<br>  the only person known to be cured of rad....Helen keller<br>  hitler and dommer both had rad|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My niece moved in with us, after a summer in an adolescent psych ward, when she was 12yo.  If we didn't take her, they were going to put her into the system, in a group home.  She had been neglected as an infant until in-laws took guardianship at about 3 months old.  They had her diagnosed with ADHD & FAS before she was 5 years old.  Over the following years, they added other psychological problems to her list of diagnoses.  When she moved in with us she was taking a cocktail of medications three times a day, some of them to counteract the effects of other medications she was taking.  <br>  <br>  We wanted to get back to the 'real kid' to see what was underneath all of that.  With her doctor's support, we weaned her off of all of her meds.  Then, we started trying to figure her out.  <br>  <br>  I don't remember the specific series of events that lead up to it, but, eventually, I was googling (or, back then, it was probably 'excite' or 'askjeeves') her behaviors and stumbled on RAD.  She displayed so many of the 'symptoms' and had experienced so many of the underlying causes throughout her life.  It all made so much sense, after that!  <br>  <br>  From there, I researched until I found a counselor who was familiar with RAD & we started her with a counselor who we thought understood it all.  The counselor, though, didn't really seem to 'get it' after all.  But, by then our niece was 13 or 14 and there were so many years of RAD coping behaviors and habits built up that I'm not sure she could have done much for her, anyway.  <br>  <br>  After her 8th grade graduation, her father decided that he was ready to parent and, by then, we were pretty defeated and felt that there was nothing more we could do for her, besides police her until she was grown.  So, we didn't put up a fight & let her go live with her dad & his new wife.  New wife had grown children - we hoped that, maybe, she would be a key for our niece.  <br>  <br>  The important thing to remember with RAD is that it is just a name for the attachment disorder, for the set of symptoms and behaviors that can result when the attachment cycle is broken in a child's life.  Knowing the name doesn't fix the problem though - it just helps you to understand it.  From there, you still need to figure out how to get past all of the survival barriers that the child has created and to get into that child's heart and figure out how to put things back in order.
f6526244f4eebe959379baecf04684a1aa	You sound pretty reasonable in this note.  Begin by discussing the fact that you agree his behavior was wrong.  Indicate that you have imposed additional punishments at home.  <br>  Then you may want to say something like, I am concerned that the atmosphere in the class as a whole is not healthy.  Other parents have approached me to indicate they are also concerned.  Describe precicely what you are hearing about the classroom.  Ask how are we going to get additional support into the classroom.  <br>  I would also be concerned and ask suggest you agree to be in contact with the principal (and teacher) in a week to check in.|`|3aqtw1dfaa	Don't go thinking that teachers are perfect, because they are not. Each teacher is different and that being the case you can get a lemon (which it sounds like that's what happened). If your son has never acted out like that except this once then you must cut some slack on your son. If it is possible request that your son have a different teacher and if he continues to act out then it was obviously not the teacher, if he doesn't act out then the teacher is to blame. <br>  <br>  If you are really strongly against the teacher teaching kids anymore you can always start a petition or talk with the parents you have been talking with and ask them to talk to the principal too. If you need to take extreme measures send your son to school with a tape recorder or hidden camera and see what you get from that (I mean, look at Christian Bale, ruined him didn't it)<br>  <br>  Hope I gave you enough ideas|`|hUbNKOTsaa	tell the principal that while your son did deserve the punishment, you really don't like the teacher's methods, and tell the principal about some of the comments the teacher makes. it is possible the principal is unaware of this. personally, I think the teacher should be fires. teachers are not supposed to act like that. If there is more than one teacher for the grade level, ask for your son to be transferred to another teacher if possible.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I would say something like "while I understand swearing is unacceptable, (insert teacher's name) should not be allowed to call anyone "retarded"- that word isn't even socially correct anymore, "Bad Person" "stupid" are all unacceptable. I would have the other parents meet you there or fax in statements if unable to attend. This teacher should not be allowed near anyone underage. Maybe they could set up a sting and have her recorded. I would recommend that to the principal.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I suggest you attend the meeting with an attitude of contrition.<br>  <br>  Following that, contact those parents who contacted you and ask if they would attend a meeting with you that involves only the principal, not the teacher.  If more than two are willing, schedule the meeting.<br>  Pre-arrange which parent will speak first, second, etc. and what will be presented in an unemotional way.<br>  <br>  I, like you, don't approve of a student showing disrespect to a teacher.<br>  However, it is not acceptable for a teacher to disrespect a student.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Tell the principal what you told us here & try to get other parents to talk to the principal as well.  Outside of that I would take a day to sit outside of the classroom & record the verbal exchanges between teacher and student.  Or send a recorder with your son if you can get him to use it without having it taken away.<br>  <br>  It is very hard to get a teacher out of the classroom without concrete proof of a problem.  Find a way to get this teacher out.
xhOulzZ7aa	Sounds like your cervix is getting ready for delivery, I'd go to the docs and see if you are dilating.

I've had mixed reactions to it. A nurse told me it is called "round ligament" pains. My OB said it could be from the baby pressing on the nerves down there which is the same as "round ligament" pains. I've also been told it's from the cervix dialating/thinning out. I am not sure it could be all of them! I am 3cm and 80 percent effaced so maybe it is!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I have been getting the same thing.  My doctor told me its just my ligaments streching.

I like Layla, too.|`|L04hnvD3aa	i think its very cute. nice name for a little girl.|`|Mey0nS7Raa	Layna? Ick. Layla is okay, especially if you're a big Clapton fan. Arden? Well, it's got that Shakespeare thing going, but then again, he named the forest Arden, not a person. It makes me think of Elizabeth Arden. I'm not especially fond of it as a first name.|`|Z5g7hCXraa	It  matters far more what you and your husband think than what I think.
f0173000dda40d230a0442e8832073d1aa	Yes and one of my babies already has grown up.<br>  <br>  The best you can do is expose them to as much education, tolerance, beauty, art and love as possible and grow them into adults that can think for themselves.<br>  <br>  My kids are 19 and 10 and you never stop teaching, praising and loving them.  As my son is in college now and a volunteer fireman I can see that what we instilled in him is paying off.  We are always telling him we're proud of him and to choose his actions and his friends with care.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your baby--my nearly 10 year old is still curled up asleep (she climbed in with us last night to snuggle sometime around 4)--I think I'll go kiss her neck and wake her up.  <br>  <br>  Your question is a good one.|`|lO2Nvj81aa	I worry about that.  I'm a Christian, though I don't go to church on a regular basis, but my beliefs are those of a Christian...  Anyway, my mom, who does go to church regularly, and reads her Bible daily (and has read it several times cover to cover) is always telling me about how different things that have happend in the recent past and that are currently happening are straight out of the book of Revelations and it scares me a lot.  <br>  <br>  I have three kids, a seven-year-old-son, a five-year-old son, and a seven-week-old baby girl.  There are times when I sit back and look at them and I wonder if they will ever make it to their teen years or if they will ever grow up to have families of their own...  It makes me SO sad and I really am scared about it so I try not to think about it very often but like I said, every now and then, those thoughts creep into my mind and I'm like, "Why are we even doing this?"<br>  <br>  The way I *try* to look at it is that there is no sense in worrying about it because you can't change/stop it if it's happening, you know?  All you can do, if your fears are at all religious in nature, is hope that your heart/family's hearts are in the right place, spirtually, so that you all end up in the same place when that time comes.<br>  <br>  ETA: On the note of Zombies...  Too funny!  And that's a whole 'nother story.  After I watched 28 Days Later I came up with a 'Zombie Attack Escape Plan' for my family.  I really wish scientists weren't messing with things ALL THE FREAKING TIME!  The idea of scientists *thinking* they're helping by trying to solve a *problem* and then *something* going wrong which leads to the human race being eradicated is VERY real to me.  Leave stuff alone already!|`|AA11109728	Yeah, I think of that everytime my younger brother and sister have a bomb threat at school.  I remember never having anything like that happen when I was in school, the only thing we had were practice fire drills.  My daughter is 4 and will be going to Kindergarten in the fall.  It scares me that I hear about 6 yr. olds in the local news who are caught carrying guns to school or on the bus.  It's stuff we never had to deal with, and it's terrifying that stupid things like that can harm so many innocent people.  Times certainly have changed...|`|3fe05dbb27a9cf0081ff4ef9a1434e1faa	Yes constantly.<br>  <br>  I never thought I'd say it but I just don't understand kids these days.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	No, I try not to worry about things I cant really control. Of course, I do try my best to do my part to help our Country, however, it still isnt enough to make the world better....I just have faith and leave it in Gods hands, as he is the only one who can make things better. I have true faith in God and I know he will always take care of my Daughter, myself, and our families. <br>  <br>  However, I do sometimes worry that I am resposible for someone other than myself, but thats the commitment i made when i got pregnant. I  just always try and do my best in raising my daughter...because i feel what i instill in her now will be with her forever,|`|VKgD1K3baa	Yes I do worry. Politically speaking, I am in fear of the debt that my son and his children will be paying off. BUT, more so, I am afraid of the teenage years!

Her house didn't have indoor plumbing; even harder to comprehend the only room with heat was the kitchen and they couldn't afford to keep the fire burning at night -and this is in Newfoundland which is one of the colder parts of Canada.   The school had NO water source, not for washing your hands and not for drinking.  There were no telephones, electricity, or tvs and computers of course.<br>  <br>  Even then there were news stories about the earth becoming over populated.  Or that people without higher education (highschool) were never going to get a job.<br>  <br>  The world of today is so completely different than the one my grandmother grew up in I can't even comprehend.  And she's happy, she thinks life is good.  I highly doubt that the world will be as much different for me when I am 70, but if it is we will adjust.<br>  <br>  They are constantly predicting (canadian figures) that gas will be $3 a liter by X or that bread will be $10 a loaf (not kidding I've read that a dozen times.  I'm sure one day they will be but not this summer or next, not until buying power catches up.  When prices go up, demand goes down and eventually things reach an equilibrium again.  Rice gets too expensive so people eat other grains.  Eventually the price of rice comes back down.|`|xnhwmontaa	Yes, I am worried the world will end. Something REALLY REALLY bad would happen. I was watching I am Legend and I was like what if that really happened? The government always messes with viruses and things like that. I don't really want to think about it. Although I am terrified of zombies lol and have thought of ways to barricade my house lol
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Have you changed your laundry detergent lately? That happened to me when I changed mine. You may have an allergic reaction or a yeast infection. Your doctor will be able to let you know. Good Luck!|`|JQcIwPXJaa	It sounds like a small infection. You are so much more susceptible when you are pregnant. I would give your midwife or OB a call and see what they recommend.|`|rjVALevtaa	Not all STDs run in your blood stream, so that isn't really accurate in determining whether or not you have an STD. STDs like Chlamydia and HPV can only be detected by a culture specifically looking for these things. <br>  <br>  It's possible that you may have a yeast infection. Do you have any white, lumpy discharge? <br>  <br>  Either way, you should definitely mention this to your doctor as itching down there is not normal.|`|OWReYgV5aa	It could definitley be due to the dry skin.  Anytime you have dry skin, it can get itchy, mine does.  And pregnancy just worsens dry skin.  Of course, it won't hurt to get checked out just in case.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Go to your doctor.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	It sounds like you may have a yeast or bacterial infection. They are treated differently so your Dr will need to do a swab of your vagina to make sure. You don't necessarily have to have a smell or anything. Sometimes women have no symptoms at all. I worked at a Dr's office for 6 years and heard many drug reps speak at conferences about STDs and their medications. 1 in 5 sexually active americans have an STD and don't even know it bc there are no symptoms and the tests do not always pick them up. HPV (the virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer) for instance can live in your body for up to 15 years without any symptoms at all and then show it's ugly face. It is the most common STD. Most of the time the only symtpom is itching. Not saying you have an STD just giving you a heads up. But I think it is just an infection. Best Wishes!|`|IoG4eZETaa	First off I hope your not sleeping around. You do have a unborn baby in you. This does sound like a early yeast infection. <br>  Get it taken care, sperm can cause this during pregnancy.
DKqsFGymaa	I like to start children in 5-ply underwear.  It's thicker to prevent so much leakage when they have an accident.<br>  <br>  Since he likes to pretend he's standing and peeing, have him sit backwards on the toilet facing the water tank.  It gives little boys the same feeling of standing and going, but they have a lot better aim!<br>  <br>  Good luck and be patient.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Training pants are worthless.  Go straight for the underwear.  Let him pick out fun characters that he likes.  Make a big deal over him becoming a "big boy".  Skip the kiddie potty.  If you just use the big one right off, there won't be any adjustment or fear when he has to go in public or at somebody's house who does not have a small potty.  If they only ever use the small one, the big one is going to seem scary.  Just stay home for a few days, and keep him in underwear, and he will eventually get sick of the wet feeling.  We potty trained two kids with this method (our son at 21 months, and our daughter at 18 months) and they both were fully trained in under 48 hours.|`|3oSQQt6maa	The training pants never worked for my son cause he saw them as diapers, so i used undies even if he had an accident i explained to him how to use it in the potty and not the undies. It gets messy but he will catch on.<br>  At first he peed alot too so i would leave him naked while at home and everytime he had to go we raced to the potty it became like a game he liked.<br>  I would leave it in the rr so he wont get confused.|`|Maepb9yraa	Have a set of toys for him that he can only play with when he is going to the bathroom and never any time else. It give him something to look forward to and he will want to go. Keep him on there for no more than five minutes. If he doesn't go, take him off and put the toys in the basket or plastic tub that you put them in. They can be books that he likes, blowing bubbles, etc. <br>  <br>  I used underwear for mine and didn't look back. They see that as a weakness on our part and will take advantage of it when pee-peeing in the potty looses its luster, so to speak. Hope that it helps|`|SWayW1ZRaa	So the best thing for me was just letting him get used to it.  Try to ween him off diapers around the house.  I got him a peter potty, its a child urinal.  He loves it, makes him feel like a big boy.  It took about 4 months for him to completely potty train.  He didnt start till he was 2 and ahalf so he was potty trained by 3.  He does where a pull up to bed since he does drink throughout the night.
Fa130w6Gaa	I don't see any good reason to pierce a baby's ears. I think they need to be old enough to help take care of them to prevent them from being infected. Also, infants and toddlers don't understand the pain they are being put through to pierce them and they frequently touch their ears which can cause them to get infected or they may even pull them out. There are so many things they could get caught on as they play or even sleep which could also pull them out or worst case, rip their ear lobe. I have also heard that there is an increased chance of the child developing a metal allergy or sensitivity later from the exposure to the metals in the earrings at such a young age. My daughter will not be getting her ears pierced until she is at least 8-10.|`|4SDqRs6Laa	Apparently it's less painful because the soft bone has not yet developed. I'm thinking of piercing my daughters ears once she has control over her hand movements for that reason and not because she has no hair and people constantly ask me if it's a boy or a girl (even though she's always wearing pink or purple!?!?!?)|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Because it's cute!  I love getting my daughter new earrings, she has little dangly ice cream cone ones in right now and get complements all the time on them, she loves the attention:)<br>  <br>  At 4 months their nerves are still not fully developed and it doesn't hurt as much as it would if you were to wait a year of more.  My daughter only cried for maybe 5-10 seconds and she was fine after that.  Plus when you get it done while they are still babies they won't play with them, they got them young enough were they think they are supposed to be there:)  They heal up in a few weeks no need to worry about them getting infected after that.|`|zBozG7Jvaa	why not it looks nice and girls who dont have hair makes them look more girly,even baby boys have it done|`|PeEIuzP5aa	because their is too many people out there that call them a boy!|`|A3AKLHz6aa	because the parents would want to and it looks cute on baby girls|`|AORcLwTNaa	cuz its cute on  a baby girl|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My mom said she got mine done because I didn't have any hair until I was two, and even in a dress people always said "Aww, isn't HE just the cutes thing you've ever seen?!" <br>  <br>  She figured people would see earring AND the dress and get the hint, lol.<br>  <br>  But that was 26 years ago and people have a different look at getting a babies ears pierced now.|`|EFYkci30aa	I know I'm going to get a lot of thumbs down for this but I'm going to state my opinion anyway:-)<br>  <br>  I think it is soooo trashy to pierce a baby's ears and why the heck would you want to put your baby through unnecessary pain??????  That's just ridiculous.<br>  <br>  My dad always said "If God wanted you to have holes in your ears he would have put them there in the first place."   LOLOL!<br>  <br>  AND ditto to what Amber said above!  You go girl.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Why not?  We pierced my daughters ears at 5 months.  We were able to keep them clean for her, and she was too young to pull at them.  She's 2 now, and loves her earrings.|`|otFCWMuUaa	idk.. it makes the process easier doing  it before  there old enough to  touch and play with them an causing an infection..<br>  <br>  <br>  although i guess it should be considered that we shouldnt put holes in our childs body until their old enough for some consent..|`|kFOX0JEeaa	so they dont feel it when they get older!!! i was mad my mom didnt do mine!!!
4xIE70C1aa	Worked in the medical field for many years and this is not unusual.  The fetus probably has it's legs crossed.  But as it develops you should be able to tell.  On the other hand wouldn't you like to be surprised?  It's really the last big surprise in life.  Good luck.|`|SY8b17Ldaa	ask your dr to order another scan|`|M5HyStReaa	you will find out in 20 weeks for sure. No ultrasound is 100% accurate for gender and at 11 weeks, most male genitalia is only just forming so I am surprised you were told a gender at this stage.<br>  <br>  A lot of hospitals in the UK have a policy of not telling genders especially where this is a local community that may abort if the child is not male|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	11 weeks sounds way too early to even tell if a baby is a boy or girl!!  I think they are pulling your leg there.<br>  <br>  It sounds like maybe your baby was moving around or the image was unclear.  They say they can't be 100% sure with these things even when they say it is a girl or boy.  I have friends whose babies kept their legs closed so they had to wait until the birth day to find out.  There are lovely unisex baby clothes out there - so just be patient.  You'll have a lovely surprise on the day.  (I'm 40 weeks tomorrow and am having a surprise by choice - can't wait!)|`|8WbfmK5daa	At 11 weeks you cannot find out the gender of the baby as it is  not developed enough.<br>  <br>  It is usually between 16-20 weeks that they can begin to gender the baby.<br>  <br>  Maybe the baby was just lying in an awkward position and they could not get a clear shot.They will usually confirm it for you at your next scan.|`|MIgxkmIqaa	If you can afford it go to a 3d ultra sound place. Most places say that if they cant find the sex they will let you go back for free until you can defenatly identify the gender. There are also blood tests that you can get that are 100% accurate and they can tell the gender! Congrats! Good Luck! I hope you get the gender you want!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	the same thing happened to my sister in law.  They old her 80% that it is a girl, luckly it was a girl.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	How could they tell you at 11 weeks.  Fast or slow heartbeat isnt always true.  Some dont talk or tell you anything which they I guess technically dont have to.  Usually they do just because the mom knows.  They were that way with my first.  They said they were there to get the details on the baby to make sure everything is ok and if she was done w/ all that and couldnt see it she wasnt going to wait and check.  She did eventually get finished and try to look but my daughter was way low and bunched up w/ her legs bunched.  The tech said girl but it flashed by so quick.  Turned out she was right.  My son, I had him at a different hospital and different OB dr and they were very nice and purposely looked for the sex for us.  It was clearly a boy.  They even printed more pictures.  I had to also go back 3 weeks after my 20 wk b/c the results showed the heart wasnt fully developed.  When I went back again it was ok and they also did 3D and 4D and printed them and gave me 6-10 of them!  I was so excited.  That facility charges for 3D and my insurance did not cover it but they switched to that option on the machine.  Maybe this tech was just being a jerk to you or having a bad day.  If they said boy and saw it but they couldnt guarantee you will either have to wait until the baby arrives to know for sure or schedule to get a 3D or regular one done.

qI1oBeEeaa	<a href="http://getinn.craves.it" rel="nofollow">http://getinn.craves.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|cWuumdy7aa	The Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth-control pill, or simply "the Pill", is a combination of an estrogen (oestrogen) and a progestin (progestogen), taken by mouth to inhibit normal female fertility. They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. They are currently used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million women in the United States. Usage varies widely by country, age, education, and marital status: one quarter of women aged 16–49 in Great Britain currently use the Pill (combined pill or progestogen only pill ("minipill")), compared to only 1% of women in Japan.<br>  COCPs may affect a woman's sexuality positively or negatively. When using contraceptives such as the pill with very low method failure rates (less than 1% per year), many women enjoy sex more because of reduced anxiety over pregnancy. COCPs may also increase natural vaginal lubrication. Other women experience reductions in libido while on the pill, or decreased lubrication.Some researchers question a causal link between COCP use and decreased libido;[70] a 2007 study of 1700 women found COCP users experienced no change in sexual satisfaction.A 2005 laboratory study of genital arousal tested fourteen women before and after they began taking COCPs. The study found that women experienced a significantly wider range of arousal responses after beginning pill use: decreases and increases in measures of arousal were equally common.<br>  <br>  you will not have any problems in coceiving after you stop taking the pill|`|AA12192295	I was on the pill for about 7 years, I had to take it when I was a teenager to deal with the cramps and I got off if a few months ago and I am now 11 weeks pregnant.

I would like children in a couple of years.<br>  I'm been on the pill for about 6 years. It's great when u have one when u can skip your period. so your only getting it every third month.

jaP0TANdaa	During some cycles my temps will stay a bit elevated during my period, sometimes all the way through it and won't drop until after it's done! It's very confusing to me sometimes. How heavy is your flow? Heavy enough for a pad or tampon? If so, I'd imagine it is your period, it's just unusual this cycle. If not, I definitely wouldn't count it as a period and wait a few days... if AF doesn't show properly then test again. Sometimes things influence our cycles and we don't even know it. Any changes in medication, diet, exercise, or anything of the like could cause your body to change during your cycle and produce different levels of hormones, which could lead to a "weird" period or a lighter flow than you're used to. I know it's so difficult to do, but try not to stress too much. Just test again in a few days if AF doesn't show. I really don't think that it would call for an immediate doctor's appointment, but if it concerns you a lot, then go. I've always been told by my doctor that one strange period (paired with negative HPT's) doesn't call for a visit, to wait until the next cycle and if it stays "weird" then to schedule an appointment. Best of luck and tons of baby dust your way. Be sure to keep us updated!|`|fYMWDQLGaa	Dear.. I am not sure about the bleeding ,but having the temp raised still, its not ur periods for sure. the day  get the period, the temp will fall off. so im pretty sure its not AF. <br>  <br>  reagrdless any symptoms, you can always rely on BBT. (only if the temp is taken at same time, as soon as you wake up & before u get up )<br>  <br>  Goodluck and loads of Baby dust...<br>  <br>  hugs and kisses to u.... ;)<br>  <br>  will pray for you...|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I had some periods like that after my 2 miscarriages last year. Some with brown spotting and some with only a day or two of red spotting. It is more likely that you are not pregnant and just experiencing a weird period so don't get your hopes up. If your temp doesn't drop or your bleeding continues to be strange then go see your midwife/OB before Friday. <br>  I know how hard it is to not get your hopes up every month and have them shattered. I'm so sorry that this is something you are struggling with. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. <br>  Best Wishes!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	oh honey you too?! its so freaky isnt it the spotting thing!<br>  we can have an 'off' cycle i guess.<br>  <br>  there's also something called 'Decidual bleeding'. its common in early pregnancy and is caused by an imbalance of hormones. it could also be implantation spotting?<br>  <br>  if not then its just your body having a dodgy month, they play tricks on us you know! i am still getting light lines - but bfn on a clearblue digi. it said 'not pregnant' but the frer had a line instantly again this morning but its so faint i am starting to think its a part of the test - like an antibody strip that just becomes barely visible ?!<br>  <br>  anyway  take heart its all good - it could be nothing but you never know it could be something great! hold out for a couple of days and see if af kicks in properly. if not, test again! xxxxxx|`|E6obQSpraa	Hi Suze<br>  <br>  I wouldnt say that this your AF simply because your temp hasnt dropped like it normally does.  I have no idea what it is but would advise that your cycle isnt always "normal". I found this out back in oct 08 when i had bleeding a week before my AF was due. I was really scared and just about to go to the docs when it suddenly stopped. It wasnt enough for a pad or tampon, then a few days later, AF finally arrived. I still have no idea what it was. If your temp doesnt drop in the next few days or AF doesnt arrive (normal flow) maybe then go to the docs.<br>  <br>  Take Care xxxx|`|4kX61Y97aa	are you having any symtoms?  i concieved 2 days before my period which i still had but missed the next one, dont worry if still your period asnt gone normal after a week go to the doctors and explain he can tell you there and then if you are. all the best my fingers are crossed for you<br>  x|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Have you been having sex recently?  You may be experiencing cervical erosion.  Means your cervix is irritated and the slight prod can cause it to bleed.  (This usually happens when you are pregnant.)  I wouldn't count it QUITE yet.  Write it down in a notebook. . . so you remember the day the bleeding took place, but don't count it yet.
N6WnSDioaa	If you can afford a baby hammock, they are THE BEST! It really gives them the feeling of being back in the womb. They look so snuggly and happy in there, I love them.

Best wishes.|`|DCKOlH13aa	It really has it's pros and cons. A bassinet is only meant to be used for the first three to four months until the baby is ready to sleep in their own crib. I just don't trust the hammocks. They are almost just like a swing, and I really only want to put my baby in a swing for a little while and not all night. A bassinet also has room for storage usually so you can store some essentials since the baby isn't in their own room for the first few months. But it's all up to each individual person. What's good for one may not be for another. Good luck.
b8f0CfSsaa	A lot of women monitor their cervix before testing as an early method of detecting pregnancy. Usually in early pregnancy the cervix is S.H.O.W: Soft High Open and Wet! The excess discharge is usually the mucus plug forming, so congratulations you are having some normal and promising symptoms!<br>  <br>  You  CAN check your cervix as long as you keep your hands clean.|`|dIW2tVxhaa	Okay, leave your cervix alone for a start! Stimulating it by examining it is really not good once you are pregnant if you think there might be a problem. Leave it to the docs to do now:)|`|fZGBjtpVaa	I'm experiencing that at the moment, I'm getting a lot of cramps, feels like period pains.  <br>  It's more than likely your womb stretching, is this your first pregnancy?

Talk to your family and friends too and ask them to support you after the birth with meals, offers of help with housework etc.  Most people would jump at the chance to help out.<br>  <br>  You need to reduce your stress down.  Listen to a relaxation tape a couple of times a day if you can.  One that is tailored to pregnant women.  I have been listening to one throughout my pregnancy and it now sends me to sleep I'm so relaxed.  I'm the same as you - bad at handling stress, but have found the tape to be my lifesaver and am going to listen to similar things the rest of my life now as it works for me.

g9l8ed4qaa	YES!!!! Your baby will be adopted by a couple who will love them. Ann if you think race will be an issue you can pick a mixed racial couple. Look at how many people go overseas these days to adopt a baby that is of another race. A health new born has many people waiting to adopt. Now some people chose not to adopt interracial so you wont have maybe as many people to choose from, HOWEVER you will still have your pick from many waiting couples. <br>  <br>  adoption.com can help<br>  so can adoptUSkids.org    Good luck to you and all the joy you are about to bring.|`|BJugETlOaa	Any baby would have a high chance of being adopted, when you can't have children you take what you can get and most people would be glad to have that child.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Unfortunately, upper middle class white couples do the most adopting.  That being said, however, I think a bi-racial baby would have a very good chance at being adopted.  Do everything possible to find an adoptive family prior to giving birth.  Keep in mind, however, that almost all babies being adopted tend to spend a week or two with specially licensed pre-adoption foster families during the legal process.  Check with various adoption agencies and placement services to ensure that both you and your baby are legally protected.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	You will be matched right away if you are looking for a pre-birth match.

I don't think race matters so much these days.|`|7JEojMgQaa	Not the top of the heap for adoption but not unadoptable. I do not believe in pre birth matching so I will also suggest having your baby first. You do not need the guilt that will be shoveled upon you if you change your mind. <br>  <br>  I also think it is better to try to parent and then admit defeat instead of saying I don't think I can and down the road, looking back, realize that you could have parented. Either way it is going to be hard on you. <br>  <br>  I know you didn't ask for my opinion on this but for your baby's sake and yours please think about it. Parenting for a few months isn't going to hurt your child's chances of being adopted. Their going to miss you regardless.<br>  <br>  I could be wrong, but don't most babies end up in foster care anyway, for at least a few weeks, if you use an agency? That might not be the case now a days, my daughters adoption was a long time ago.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	These days, your baby would have about 150% of getting adopted by a loving married couple even if it is mixed race and handicapped too!<br>  There are long waiting lines of couples wanting to adopt babies.

Race is just not important to most of these people.<br>  It is simply not true that there is any lack of adoptive parents for any baby.|`|AA11616741	Most people would like to adopt a white baby, but a lot of people would also like to adopt a mixed race baby.

Things might change for you, once you see and hold your child.  You do not need the added pressure from an adoption agency and a couple.  Keep this a peaceful event.<br>  <br>  After you have held and loved your baby, if you still feel adoption is right for you, then make your plan.<br>  <br>  best wishes.|`|OJ79Daygaa	There is a great chance of your baby being adopted!!  My husband and I are adopting a biracial baby next month!  There is a great agency called the Edna Gladney home that has a special  program for the adoption of biracial children.  God Bless you for making the rifght choice not to abort your baby!|`|0nR2Rsj7aa	When i looked into adoption they ask you all about what children you would care for. Ie race religon etc they always try and make sure that any child will fit in with their adoptive parents. I am sure that if you decide that you want to do that your child will be very much loved and wanted|`|yKS2UI87aa	You do not need to worry, people that want to adopt do not care if the baby is of mixed race. Most just want a healthy baby. There are even mixed couples that prefer that the baby is mixed. Good luck and I am so happy you are choosing life for your unborn baby!!|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Think carefully, research and please don't choose for a pre-birth match - sorry don't agree with pre birth matching.  I don't think it will be an issue that your baby is biracialas attitudes are different these days.|`|tLcOikV8aa	Well then that means its tan.<br>  The baby will look normal its o.k.<br>  You will get a lot of people wanting to adopt the baby.<br>  I think a good name for a ( tan ) baby like that would be Jesslin.<br>  <br>  Any Qs? Just e-mail me. Im always here.|`|d304540c53bb1ee7a9ad670a4d0574e8aa	no I wouldn't think so, a newborn is always the first to go.  There are many eager couples waiting to adopt.  it is a hard decision and congrats on trying to make the right one|`|vqaleXR6aa	There is an high chance because there are alot of black and white couples together that cant consieve and they would most likely want a bab  that look like them.|`|8e83e02e2cedc4f291e528447d29ff5caa	My husband and I are in the process of trying to adopt. We've been looking into foster care and have our first orientation this month. Going into it...we are 100% completely open to all races/genders. All we want is a child...race is NOT an issue to us.<br>  <br>  We have a 3 year old biological daughter and came to the conclusion we would like to add to our family but give a child who is already here a loving home. <br>  <br>  I don't know whether it's just my thought process because I am open to it...but I don't think you will have any trouble adopting your child because he/she is biracial. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and I can honestly say at this point in time I would gladly adopt your child...so I cannot imagine you would have much difficulty.|`|BEV7e3tWaa	Not necessarily. It will depend on the agency you choose to work with. I spend a lot of time discussing adoption with families working with agencies who are open to any race. These families are good Christian families working with agencies. There are some couples who are biracial, african american or one spouse that is white and one that is black who are looking to adopt as well. Yes, the majority of adopting families only want a white baby - but they are not the only families out there. You could contact Project Cuddle - they work with women all over the United States who are looking for options for their baby and themselves. I have discussed adoption with a couple different families who have black and biracial children and that is why they are hoping to adopt another child who can share the heritage with their other children. If you would like more information on families that I know specifically who are hoping to adopt a biracial or african american child then send me an email. <br>  <br>  Just so you (and everyone else out there) are aware: any family who wants to adopt a child by working with you personally and not an agency HAS TO have a home study done by an agency (with back ground checks, a home inspection, interviews, references etc). The reason that people hope to adopt with a private adoption is because it costs around 5,000 as opposed to the 15,000 - 20,000 an agency charges. Private adoptions are not free - but they are significantly cheaper. An agency or lawyer is still involved like they would working with an agency. But the reason that an agency charges so much is for their advertisements and finding the baby. <br>  <br>  Anyway, let me know if you have questions or want to be put in touch with an agency or family who can help you find a home for your child. <br>  <br>   Our daughter was considered "difficult" to find a family for from what we have been told- she was conceived in rape, gender was "unknown", she was hispanic, her mom had no prenatal care etc - but we wanted her anyway and she is the love of our lives :) There are many families out there who are open...you just have to find the right ones :)|`|CWXNo3z5aa	I'm an adoptive mom living in Texas. We adopted a baby 2 years ago who is Mexican/African American. We are now in the process of trying to adopt again through an agency. I think it definitely depends on the state you live in. The reality of the situation in Texas is that 30% of babies put up for adoption are biracial or black. Only 10% of couples looking to adopt in Texas are willing to adopt a baby that is biracial or black. This is sad but true. If you go to an agency, they will most definitely have at least 3-4 waiting couples who are open to any race. You won't have any trouble finding someone who would like to adopt your baby. You just won't have as many people waiting in line like they do for a white baby. I happen to think that the people who adopt biracial or African American children are the creme' de la creme' of adoptive parents. We don't care about race, we just care about loving a child and giving them a loving home. Race doesn't matter!<br>  <br>  My husband and I are ONLY looking for a biracial or African American baby. We want our children to be able to relate to each other on an ethnic level. We hope it will help them get through some of the issues they are going to face being in a transracial family. Don't worry. There will be someone out there for your baby. God Bless!
hYRYO5GYaa	wait a few days and buy an EPT...clearblue lied to me too|`|3Ks21ASDaa	yes, don't go cheap on a pregnancy test. you will get the best results from a test if you take it after you've missed your period. some can read up to 5 days before a missed period, but the answers won't be as reliable.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would wait like two more weeks and test again.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The earliest a test will work is 10 days after sex.  It is best to wait 19 days for the most accurate results though.  You can use any test.  The dollar store ones are actually some of the most accurate.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	First response gave me a false + i hate that brand i was so excited for nothing =( . I actually love clear blue, when i had my first it showed + right away. you did take the test too early though you should wait untill u actually miss your period or atleast a day before you're suppose to get it for a better answer. good luck! and i have heard the same thing that the cheap tests are better, i never personally tired it but hey anything is worth a shot<br>  <br>  baby dust to you and everyone else trying to conceive!!
buoqtZeFaa	I don't have any tricks but i sympathize with you.  I am only 30 weeks and I find it very hard to sleep at night.  I am usually a stomach sleeper and the adjustment has been really hard.<br>  <br>  Just wanted to say good luck to you and hang in there it's almost over.|`|H0fXySX9aa	a warm milky drink used to work for me <br>  no food after 6 at night and a nice warm bath before bed|`|7Uke8dbiaa	I was the same way, and I ended up sleeping on my back anyways.  No ill effects!  The truth is, though, at the end, there's just no way to be comfortable, so you just get snatches where you can.  If you really don't want to sleep on your back, then don't, but I don't think it will hurt anything.
DHW8x1d8aa	German/ Dutch boy's name. It's a version of Johannes which is John in Hebrew. It means God is gracious.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Boys|`|IOQshyGMaa	It's def. boys.|`|AA11612508	boys...i think germany|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It's a German boy's name.|`|ac4kIyYDaa	its german for john|`|5u92Bw3Baa	Its a males name. A good friend of mine carries that name. I think pretty highly of him. Good morals and character, all that good stuff. It's of German/Dutch descent. It may also be recognized in the Netherlands and Denmark. Shortened form of John. Go with it.|`|RnopSbHqaa	iti is a boys name. check out the website. <a href="http://www.babynames.com/name/HANS" rel="nofollow">http://www.babynames.com/name/HANS</a>|`|Fa130w6Gaa	Hans is a very common German boy's name. It is the same as John.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Definitely a boy's name
YsQQ30YJaa	I would say no. Kids that young have trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. Wait until after 10 or so.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	If your reading for the child to get the concept of reading i think Harry Potter is to advanced for them to understand.  The nanny should be reading more books with sight words that will prepare the child for reading the types of books like Harry Potter. <br>  <br>  At 6 they should be read WITH not read TO.  If you're doing all the reading they are only getting the benefit of you reading. Being read with they get the benefit of reading with you and learning to read themselves.|`|AA11247439	not only will they be a little scary they are inapropriate<br>  <br>  in the 7th book Molly weasley calls bellatrix lestrange  a B****   after bellatrix sends a killing curse at ginny weasley|`|rQXW9eeqaa	i thnk that the books are for all ages, but personally am not all that sure that 6 yr old would quite understand it, its worth a try though :D|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Truthfully i think it's a little to mature for a 6 year old. Probably read it to an 8 year old and up. It is a very full-on story. Awesome but the words and names are tricky even for adults.|`|Q5oBepLeaa	depends, you would have to see if the parents are okay with it first, but you also need to know that at the age kids need to be a little more mature to understand them as well.|`|sYFfji1Naa	id run it by the parents first, but my daughter is 4 and personally id read the books to her, personal choice i guess|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	well not scary i just don't know how much he would be able to understand|`|21Lnhdfeaa	I'd agree with the person who said run it by the parents first (it really is their choice whether or not they want it read to their children).  But as far as too scary, I don't think so.  My father read the Lord of the Rings to my siblings and me since we were very small children, much younger than 6.  And I read Harry Potter to my children (ages 3 and 18 mos) and they've not had issue with it.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Probably a little bit scary....it all depends on the kids too, my younger child likes the morbid/gory stuff and doesn't spook as easily as the older one.
LfqpBjSfaa	As the adoptive parent of two children, I will admit we did it for selfish reasons.  We wanted kids.  The fact that they came with a nominal stipend, plus college tuition, was not even made known to us until AFTER we were accepted as parents.<br>  <br>  Adopting a child does not make any money.  So rest assured that they are not doing it for any financial gain.  It is not just an 18-year commitment, but a lifelong commitment, to "raise these children as your own."<br>  <br>  We are blessed to have found the rest of our family.  I can't imagine the time before they came into our hearts and home that Christmas day 5 years ago.<br>  <br>  William|`|vO9fPCm2aa	How lucky those kids are for having a family. To many are left to wallow in foster care until they max out at 18. No one to guide them just see ya your on your own. Most will wind up homeless on drugs and alcohol, selling their only asset, their bodies, just to survive. As long as they have lots of love to give and the patience to have 6 kids in the house all at once, I shout WAHOO!!! :~)|`|c73QkZ2haa	Or the beterment of 6 childrens lives. If they raised their children and they are gone they may feel the need tostill contribute. I think its great theyve given 6 children a family to grow up with and be loved.
Iu0AJDviaa	No not me but i have heard of this happening,it is quite normal.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	I started leaking earlier than you! It is normal. :)<br>  i am now 37 weeks but have been leaking since 33-34 weeks.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	It's nothing to worry about.  Same thing happened to me when I was pregnant.  It can be a bit embarrassing if you soak through.  So be prepared with pads to put in your bra to soak it up, or a extra bra handy, etc.|`|xhOulzZ7aa	Yes I was with my first one, especially at night in bed. Don't stress its just colostrum. Best of luck with the birth, not long to go now|`|4XfjUcvDaa	My doctor warned me about that.  They told me to make sure I get the nursing pads for before the baby is born.|`|bmJf3AVPaa	no, but it sounds messy.|`|4GwTDea1aa	im also 35 weeks and leak occasionally, but nothing serious! Try breast pads... they work pretty well! Good Luck Congrats on the baby Boy|`|f2cbdf6e29f9f4bf30122b5b11a4cdabaa	i was 26 weeks when my milk came in and started leakin all over the joint, just becareful, i reccomend reusable pads as they dont tend to rip half ur nipple off when u take them off where as disposable ones do|`|SY8b17Ldaa	man i would hear a baby cry and it would be like a tap was turned on lol im still like that but i had my little girl 3 weeks ago but yes its totally normal|`|78wKz71Saa	its normal.
pp9RzHvDaa	Call your doctor and tell him/her the issue because if you're on what I think you're on then you're going to have trouble weaning yourself off of those medications.  Is it Darvocet, Hydocodone, and Dilaudid?  All of these, especially Dilaudid, are extremely addictive.  The nausea medication might not be too bad but I would worry about the pain killers.  Your doctor will choose the best way of detox for you.  Maybe try taking a test and if it's positive, call the doctor.|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	If you can stand the pain; you need to quit taking the medication until you find out for sure that you are pregnant. Maybe a call to your doctor about the "question that you think you might be" would be the best thing to do right now, but I am pretty sure they will tell you to stop taking the medication til you find out for sure. Then they can give you something else for the pain that will not harm the baby. Hope all turns out good on your end.|`|90zcKChJaa	You need to consult your doctor about this. There could be A LOT of serious issues with taking pain killers while pregnant.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	my mom has 7 kids and she says it might not be that bad just stop taking them.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	You for sure need to be calling your gyno ASAP. Most pain killers aren't good for a pregnancy and this is something a doctor needs to answer for you.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Well, first go take a pregnancy test to see if you are or are not pregnant.  I'm sure you've never been wrong before...but have you ever had to make that call while doped up on pain meds?  If the test is positive, stop taking all of those pain meds immediately and call your doctor to let them know that you are pregnant.  Chances are if you are pregnant your baby is fine.  Lots of women do a lot of things that are counterindicated in pregnancy in the very early stages before they know that they are pregnant.  Most of them have normal healthy babies.  There's no point in stressing over things that are already done as you can't do anything about it now.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	When was the possible conception in comparison to when you took the drugs?<br>  <br>  I would imagine that you're fine. Women, can sometimes do a lot of things they shouldn't before they find out that they are pregnant. Are you still taking the drugs? Assuming that you're not, I don't think you'll have a problem, but talk to you doctor! That's what they're there for after all. <br>  <br>  On top of that, is it possible that the drugs you were taking have similar side effects to the symptoms of pregnancy. Nausea meds make me think so.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck, and I'm sure you'll be fine.
ZvPJjme9aa	it is quite highly possible although <br>  my great gran had two sets of twins<br>  my gran had two sets of twins<br>  my uncle has had 1 set of twins<br>  <br>  ive got two children but no twins so although we have a higher chance its not definite<br>  good luck

be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	The depo shot can really mess your body up. My best friend was on it for a year and it took twice that for her to get her cycles back. She has been trying for a baby for three years since then and still no baby. <br>  <br>  It will probably take a long time to get your cycle back on your own.<br>  <br>  I wish people knew the real deal when it comes to the depo shot, it messes people up so bad, it shouldn't even be on the market in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I would talk to your doctor about this.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It can take quite awhile to conceive after being on depo.  6 months or longer is not uncommon.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	You could be there's no way of knowing unless you speak to your doctor and the whitew discharge is normal. Its clear-white color I found it increased when I was pregnant and now with this pregnancy.
4ZzLtY9Saa	I would ask for another scan at 8 weeks you will not have a bump the baby is far too small and most people don't develop a bump until 4 months depending on how slim they are.<br>  <br>  If November was the last time you had sex then you will be 3-4 months depending on the dates,  but if you have protected sex after November then you still could have became pregnant at a later date (no protected sex is 100%)<br>  <br>  Go back to your GP and tell them you want another ultrasound.  The person that gave you an ultrasound does not sound properly qualified, they will be able to tell how far you are along with your first scan because of the size of the baby.  I would ask that you see another person to give you your ultrasound next time.<br>  <br>  Edit:   Any pain in the stomach while pregnant without bleeding especially if they think it is ectopic require an ultrasound (as it is life threating), this is disgraceful I would put in a complaint and go to another hospital|`|lEJCZP0Qaa	if that was the only time you can think of that you cold of gotten pregnant then something is not right as there should of been more than i little shadow on scan. When i was 6 weeks there was a tiny little sac with a black blob in it which is my baby. I would go straight back and ask for another scan asap as those 'shadows' could be something else that really n eeds to be checked|`|AA11661793	if the last time you had sex was in november you are definately further than 8 weeks. have you been to the doctor again? I got pregnant around november 19 (last time I had sex... and I'm married... yeah my sex drive is gone!) but anyways I am 16 weeks 3 days. I havent had a scan yet but my doctor says everything seems on track. Ask for another scan again. Good luck!|`|VEEbzc4jaa	The scans are very accurate. Ur have another scan at 12 weeks and that will be ur set date, so it may change.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately they dont throw scans to everyone hear there and everywhere, so if they refused to give you scan everything must be ok with ur little one.<br>  <br>  Also people grow at different times throughout there pregnancy. You probably are going through the bloaty stages, this will dye down and soon ur belly will harden by about 17-20 weeks.<br>  <br>  If ur belly looks like a proper bump already sounds like ur gonna have a HUGE bump!!|`|4kX61Y97aa	they go by measurements thats how they work the weeks out. i still had my period which usually i have lot of pain but didnt then didnt have another one the scans are fairly accurate but baby might be older than what they have said which you find baby might arrive early <br>  <br>  al lthe best

SCErLQ3yaa	I LOVE the names!! Alexander is very nice and I like the nickname Alex if you choose to shorten!<br>  Keegan is just absolutely stunning. And I really like the middle name Elaine, too. You got lucky with a cute family name!<br>  <br>  GREAT JOB!!! :)|`|AA10536915	I don't just look at names but initials too.  If say your last name is Dupont.  Alex would be ADD.  So I would look at that too, but I like the name Alexander.<br>  <br>  Keegan is not a name that I would like to name a girl.  It sounds to close to Kegel for my money. The name Elaine I have always thought was a pretty name.  Again look not just at the names but the initials. Also, people think that names sound so cool, but if you would not want that name for the rest of your life then don't do that to your kid.|`|3325f1366bcf14efb105795a6e2732d1aa	I think they are lovely names, but instead of Keegan, what about Kagen or Kaden?  I have heard those names before and it is very neat.  No matter what name you choose it will be one that you and your family are happy with, and one that your child will be blessed with.  Good luck!|`|IhMktVTIaa	I LOVE the name Keegan and Alexander is good too.  Although I think I would end up nicknaming Alexander to Alex.  I'm all for family names for middle names!  They belong as middle names, that way the kid still has their own identity for their first name!   Great choices!|`|ln0wLqZhaa	I love the name Alexander  lol  donald is cute to <br>  <br>  don't like the girls name ... Well not keegan i like Elaine tho :)|`|hBCfrl5Aaa	I love the name Alexander!

uI7oOgwsaa	I stopped believing in luck when I was about 8 or 9. Don't worry, no bad omen will come of you buying a pram. You've just prepared yourself as a mother and that's good if anything. There's really no such thing as luck or karma. What is good luck is that you found a bargain!|`|46K4FtE0aa	After 12 weeks the risks of anything happening drop dramatically. It is an old wives tale that it is unlucky to have the baby's stuff in the house before it is born and some people still believe in it. But think about it, what about women who have another baby straight after the first one and still have the pram for the next one, its the same thing isn't it, the pram is in the house and being kept for the next child. If you feel uncomfortable, get a relative to take it for you until baby is born.|`|185431bf2d462938a17318fe8510b2c0aa	I don't think so, people say not to buy the cot before its born as well as that's bad luck.<br>  Im 35wks 5days and we had brought the cot at around 25 weeks.<br>  we also brought the pram early. People say not to keep that in the house until its born but we have<br>  its superstition, if you can get as much as you can before its born good for you. we did and it has saved us having to pay out loads at the end!!!|`|So7lXdBKaa	its up to the individual it makes more sense to spread the expense over the nine months rather than trying to get all you need at the time of the birth . its and old wives tale  that it is un lucky  in olden days all you needed for your baby was handed down from your family and not bought like now so it was all available on the day of the birth|`|fNgv2FeRaa	No its fine hunny don't you worry.<br>  I bought all my stuff when we were just trying for a baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the pregnancy xx|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Definitely not!<br>  <br>  I was buying blankets, toys...everything left right and centre when I was 6 weeks. Theres nothing wrong with being excited and you won't be jinxed.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	Im not sure if it is bad luck or not but I am not buying anything until after I find out what I am having.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Are you a superstitious person? Do not be silly, it is not bad luck.|`|ZqCzcQlvaa	Absolute tosh that its bad luck! Glad you got a bargain, the only problem will be that in 6 months time when the baby arrives you will want a 'new' pram!! Good luck xx|`|SpcYCBndaa	there's no such thing<br>  it's just destiny|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	No,Not at all.|`|tljc8Axkaa	I MYSELF DO BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE BUT IM NOT SURE IF I WOULD BE BUYING THINGS AT SUCH AN EARLY STAGE IF YOU GO GET EVERYTHING NOW WHAT AN EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE NEXT 6 MONTHS I ENJOYED MY FIRST 7 MONTHS SAVING THEN WENT AND BOUGHT EVERYTHING IT WAS SOOO EXCITING HAVEING ALL THIS STUFF DELIVERED TO MY HOUSE AND IT MADE THE LAST 2 MONTHS GO QUICKER THEN I THOUGHT GOOD LUCK|`|su9CEx0eaa	I don't know of any bad luck related to your preparation. When we first had kids we got everything before the birth so I wouldn't worry. Good luck and I hope the pregnancy goes ok.|`|GjuRYsITaa	no i think its Just a myth that about these people who have the same pram with there first and second if your that worried could you take it to your parents or a friends house|`|lj47k4A1aa	lol why does everyone get so superstitious when pregnant.  Keep your chin up, it'll be fine and you'll have a healthy kid
Q2IbbjGxaa	i used dr. brown bottles for my sons and i loved them they helped out with their cloiciness. when it comes to sippy cups if there is only one kind she will use then go buy them as she gets older she will want to use a big girl cup and a straw, they are great to use, for bed time only. but try to get her off going to bed with a bottle let her have a cup before she goes to bed and that way she will get used to a cup faster for you. good luck with everything|`|fZGBjtpVaa	Is your one year old just on milk all day?  Or have you already started to wean her?<br>  <br>  I used Dr Brown bottles and found them really really good, I switched to normal bottles while I weaned my daughter at 6 months as she stopped getting colic when I weaned her.  <br>  Is she breasfeeding or forumla milk?|`|hcwp2mAyaa	i dunno but all u can do is give it a go. im starting my baby on a sippy cup at 6mnths and ill be using dr.browns. she uses the dr.browns bottles|`|Iu0AJDviaa	I take my kids on a special trip to the shops to buy a sippy cup at about 1and a half ,and then they take that to bed until they are 2 then they have a regular cup to take to bed.|`|AA10188961	I loved my Dr. Brown bottles.  They solved so many tummy problems with my oldest, I didn't try anything else with my youngest.  <br>  <br>  Weaning...they have the Y cut nipples that allow almost as much milk out as sippy cups, so a little while with those, they were ready.  We never had a problem with the bottles at night.  Unless we used the Y cut, because they leaked.
b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	No miscarriages in themselves are not hereditary however you have to look at what caused the miscarriages. If it was natural then once again no harm to you but if it was due to a problem ( pcos, or something else) then that maybe hereditary. I think you will be fine.|`|dlOFWcU4aa	It should not affect your chances of having children.  I had an Aunt that had 6 miscarriages.  It was back in the time before the Rhogam shots.  Technology is amazing now and you have really good chances.  Good luck!!!|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Considering most of the time no one knows why it happened we really can't know if it is hereditary....don't worry about it though I'm sure your fine.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Miscarriages are very common.  If your grandmother had many pregnancies, she may well have had 5 miscarriages. (My mother had 4 term pregnancies and 3 miscarriages.) <br>  <br>  YOU are here, so obviously your family is capable of producing children.  It's very unlikely that there is any sort of family/genetic disorder causing you to have miscarriages, but if, when you do start trying, you have multiple miscarriages, your doctor will ask about your family history.<br>  <br>  But ... don't borrow trouble.  You will probably be fine.
C7Ujon3Xaa	I'm surprised!!!<br>  <br>  Most teenagers (me included) would love it if our moms went to work.<br>  <br>  More freedom!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Respect mom for doing all she can to provide for her family. Shed be home if she was rich ok. Yes it must be nice for those others, but they are not you. Its sad but it happens. Food and rent and new clothes for you are not free or cheap hun. Maybe you can study with a friend each night so your not alone so much????|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I am staying home with my son and taking babysitting/nanny jobs until he is in school full time (and will do the same with out next one too which is why we hope to have another in 3-4 years) and when they are both almost in school FT I am going to get licensed for preschool so I can be with my kids on all school holidays/vacations and snow days. Or I may just nanny forever.. who knows? As long as I can give my kids the life I enjoyed and still contribute money to the family somehow I will be happy. (my mom stayed home with us until we were in school FT then worked in the school cafeteria and had the same schedule as we did).|`|DDFSITiYaa	Some moms don't have a choice - they have to work to earn money to support the family.  Other moms find that they are more fulfilled people if they work - it's not that their kids are not important but they as individuals have the drive and ambition to also work. <br>  <br>  Or even if finances are ok, the mom might work to provide more opportunities or luxuries to their families... I know if I didn't work, my kids would not be enjoying  dance lessons, swim clubs, skiing, ice skating, art classes, etc.  I am lucky enough to work from home but still, every moment of my day, of my life is done with the intention of improving quality of life for my family.|`|xS1fLOueaa	My mom is a single parent so she can't stay home. My grandmother takes care of me when she's away (from 7 am to 8 pm.) Sometimes I wish she would have chosen a different, less time consuming job so we could spend some time together. I think if we were closer talking about 'certain' subjects would be more comfortable in my opinion. But then again she doesn't really have a choice. Either way I love my mom no matter how long she has to work.|`|SfwLF8j2aa	I have 4 children.My boys are 15,9,& 6.My daughter is almost 12.I have always been a stay at home mom.I may go to work when my kindergartner is a little older,but I do love being a stay at home mom.I know there are a lot of moms that have to or want to work and that is fine for them.My husband and I just never wanted our children to have to go to a babysitter or daycare,but some moms don't have that luxury.|`|hGY08GjRaa	My mom didn't work until my brother was almost 16 and I was 13. Then she started part time. We were maybe home for a couple  hours before she was. She trusted us. The only pain was sometimes she'd forget to leave the key LOL.. and my brother would have to remove a screen or something to break in. Eventually we got keys to carry with us.. <br>  <br>  A year later, we chose to go to a boarding school in the next state, because we wanted to go to a christian school.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think my mom raised us well. THe fact that she was always home when we got home was comforting.  I can't remember having a babysitter (I guess I probably did on occasion, but don't remember it.) She ALWAYS knew where we were, who we were with, and what we were doing, and it kept us out of trouble (I'm so happy for this now.. I don't  have any regrets for doign stupid things when I was too immature to know better) She was able to really RAISE us with the morals and values she wished to instill. <br>  <br>  Of course, she had the luxury of a husband who brought home over 1000 a week (not bad for the 80's and 90's) Not everyone has that luxury.. many women are single, or both have to work to support the family.  So, I certainly don't judge any working mothers.|`|4HvuxHPoaa	I'm 15 (The oldest in my familia) and my mom has been a stay at home mom all my life. And she plans on staying a stay at home mom. yay. It's great.
YXTMk7H5aa	What does she like? does she know what a barbie is? or a doll? or anything super girly?<br>  <br>  Well if i were you i would play it safe and make it a girly pink theme. ask the members to either bring a toy that represents a doll or stuffed animal. maybe even a little tiara. send out invites that has cute stuffed animals in it and let her draw one little thing on it. members can get her little cheap furniture that can have princess' or pink on them. a small cake. make it more pink and casual than i am putting it and i think that would be cute!|`|8oAlBL91aa	My cousin had the cutest theme for her one year old. All the party things said one on them and they were pink and purple, she got them at target I believe. But she goes way over board for a childs birthday party so who know what she paid for them.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Princess, whatever movies are popular right now, fairy tale,
zHRWklEWaa	I would do a butterfly and flowers party.  Maybe make her a book of her first year for when she is older. This party is really going to be more for you then her at this age so do what you think is cute.
GliFw6eWaa	I had this when I was pregnant,but before you get excited, I would wait a few days and take another test.  Sometimes these things happen before a period.  My pregnancy tests always showed positive before I had even missed my period, but that doesn't mean yours would.  Just take another, you may find that the first test was wrong or taken too early.|`|ikPKFCscaa	I would take a test sounds POSTIVE! Baby DUST***
fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	First, you need to express, express, express!  Especially if you have any bumps or bulges under your arm which by the way is trapped milk in your glands.  So get a breast pump, preferrably electric (Medela is great) and get that milk out!  Of course you want to breast feed straight from your breast but trust me, with engorged breasts you will have so much milk that your newborn will not drink both your breasts empty, so even if you express enough from both breasts to stop feeling pain, there will be plenty of milk still in your breasts to feed your baby straight rather than giving the expressed milk in the bottle (which I dont think is a problem really).<br>    It really helps if you have a hot compress on both your breasts and those lumps under your arm if you have any of those.  Just get a cloth or hand towel wet them with water as hot as you can stand it and hold over each breast for a minute or two before you express.  The heat will help 'bring down' so to speak , the milk.  <br>    And when your breasts are that rock hard it can be difficult for your baby to latch on because the nipple wont be as soft and easy to take.  They wont get better on their own unless you breast feed or express.  Also a very hot shower is good, because the heat usually gets the milk flowing by itself and they'll just start spraying. lol, but atleast you wont have any mess to clean up.  lol :)<br>  <br>  <br>  xxx  good luck!|`|lISrOzyraa	Yes mam it is normal. There's milk producing in your breast right now, one of the things I did was buy a breast pump and pumped even though I was not breast feeding anymore, that helped keep my breast at a normal feeling. It will eventually go down. There's nothing wrong with squeezing some milk out of it. Try putting a warm clothe on it, or when your in the shower-let warm water run, trust me it will relieve the pain. Hope this helped and congrats on your baby. Babies are a blessing from god :)|`|JgZwvXXJaa	Wrap them in a ace bandage or wear a sports bra do not touch then or run them under hot water in the shower take motrin for pain and just wait!!|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Yes, this is normal your milk just came in(the first few days you only have colostrum not milk).  Breastfeeding will be a little easier for you to try again, once you let down the milk will pretty much pour into his mouth.  You should contact a lactation consultant, they probably have one on staff at the hospital you were just at, give them a call:)  He could be having problems suckling or latching on, he is new at this too, give him time, it has only been a few days.  I know it can be hard but this is the best start for your little one:)  As for the engorgement.... I can honestly say there wasn't anything I could do to make it feel better for the first day or two.  I tried hot showers, cabbage leaves, hot compresses and ibuprofen, nothing seemed to help:(  I grew from an A cup to a D in a few hours...ouch!  They did look beautiful, but I just couldn't touch them!  Good luck!  <br>  <br>  You should definitely be trying to express the milk, if it is left there it can cause an infection in one(or more) of your milk ducts!  <br>  <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding benefits<br>  * you burn up to 1,200 calories a day(the more milk you make the more calories you burn)<br>  *Your uterus contracts and tightens after every feeding, helping you get bikini ready a little quicker<br>  *reduces the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)<br>  *higher IQ<br>  *less likely to deal with depression as a adolescent and adult<br>  *lowers risk of high cholesterol and heart disease<br>  and many other benefits:) Good luck!!<br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least the first 12 months and the World Health Organization recommends the first 2 years:)|`|nqHSQpqZaa	The same thing happened to me, it's okay that you are not breastfeeding. Happy mom equals happy baby. I kept trying for 2 weeks, my son was trying to nurse every 20-30 minutes, and I couldn't physically or emotionally handle it anymore and was pretty much going insane there was no problems latching on or anything I'll just be honest. I pumped out another weeks worth and then quit.When I quit they swole up really big and they hurt sooo bad, I know exactly what you are going through. But each day it just gets better and better. After a few days of the pain easing up (like 2-3 days) i woke up one morning and they were not swollen anymore, they didn't hurt at all and I'd have a leak here and there but those stop eventually. I think if you stopped on Monday then definitely when you wake up Friday or Saturday you should have relief, maybe even tomorrow. Take some ibuprofen maybe? Ice packs help but my chest was so sensitive that having anything TOUCH them was too much pain. Good luck momma (:|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Stopping breast feeding can sometimes take a good week or 2 for your breasts to ease off. With my youngest it took 3 weeks for the pain to ease. Don't express any though as the milk will just reproduce.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	It is very typical for engorgement to happen in the beginning.  Your baby eventually regulates how much milk they need you to produce.  Usually takes about a couple of weeks.  But sometimes our bodies get to work and work well!  When you have engorgement you can pump *just a little* to relieve the pressure and fullness and then baby can successfully latch on.  If you are feeding on demand (every 1 1/2 hour to 3 hours) you should have that much engorgement.  But in the beginning if you aren't feeding often enough it can be more excessive and some boobies just produce alot in the beginning.  If you want to breastfed you still can, you've just had a rough start of it.  Your baby will regulate the amount of milk, try using a pump for a few minutes to relive the engorgement or you can get in a hot shower and the water will stimulate a let down and relive the engorgement.  You can also contact your lactation consultant at the hospital or La Leche and they will give you some one on one advice and help with baby's latch.  Good luck new mommy and congratulations!
WPI0Z47saa	I started the same way with my son and yes that means that he isn't ready. You should always make the potty available, put it where they can see it, and talk about it. Maybe get some books to read stories about the potty. My son actually liked the movie "Potty power" and it made him want to "try" at least. His doctor says that boys take a little longer sometimes and it isn't unusual for them to be 3 1/2 or 4 when they are actually potty trained all the way. He said that the worst thing to do is to force the child and to let them tell you when they are ready. He said look for signs like waking up dry, going long periods in between diapers, feeling uncomfortable when they do go in their diapers and if they want their diaper changed right away. You should also not make them sit for long periods of time on the potty at once since this will slow the process down. My son would gladly sit on the potty for 40 minutes if you let him until he goes but this is so uneffective. I was told that he just isn't completely ready alothough he is getting close and that they need to learn of the "feeling' or sensation they get before they have to go before it will work. I would just sugguest the books and video for now to get him used to the idea. It will all fall into place. Hope this helped.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	having the same issues with my daughter. My SIL suggested putting poopy in the potty from a dirty diaper and pretending that they went. make a HUGE deal about it. Praising, singing, clapping. Then show them when you throw it in the toilet and flush it. Make more of a big deal. I have been giving her stickers... though I have YET to get her to go in the potty chair, I have succeeded in getting her to ask me for the potty more often and she is telling me now everytime she goes even if its in her diaper. I think thats a good start so far.... now just waiting for the real thing to happen so I can quit pretending!!!|`|FirFhrdnaa	My son was 2 yrs and 10 months when he FINALLY trained. By experience i can tell you boys take longer than girls. But i know this sounds weird but the only way i could get my son to learn was to take away diapers completely!!! NO PULL UPS AT HOME!! Pull ups confuse them . When possible you have to let them FEEL their peeing themselves and they eventually learn they 1. don't like being soaked and 2. to go to the potty chair when they feel it coming. At night pull ups...or when you go to town but other than only underwear...messy..yes....but i Promise it works the quickest.|`|sAbah6dTaa	I've always heard to throw cheerios in the potty and tell them to shoot em...|`|jpwtnVjqaa	a belt...lol also train they to do right<br>  '|`|RcbGiORSaa	I have 2 boys ages 4 and 2.  They were both potty trained before they turned 2.  The way we did it was we would let them watch daddy go potty and see how "big boys do it" then we put a stool in front of the toilet and show teach them to hold on to the lifted toilet seat cover and that worked perfect.  They wont have to worry about aiming because if they hold onto the back it is already aimed for them.  Then when they get a little bit bigger they will figure out how to aim by themselves.  I liked training them this way because it was immediate!!  as soon as they saw they could go like daddy they would go in there by themselves stand on the stool and go.  I just always make sure I have clorox wipes to clean under the toilet seats where there hands go every time they use the potty.  Good luck, and dont let people tell you boys are slow, i have heard that so many times and I still have yet to see it.  they will tell you the same thing when it comes to school and dont expect too much from them!!  I believe it is all on how much time and patients you have!!
PTdy6TWRaa	Some 9 and 10 year olds can throw at about 40-50mph. Occasionally you'll find a 12 year old in Little League who can reach almost 70mph on a pitch. 14-15 year old pitchers in Little League more often reach 70mph on a pitch.|`|CxCigxZIaa	Ummmmm...as fast as he can. <br>  ?
Ka52nbhNaa	Our first appointment was a consultation - met the doctor, saw the clinic, discussed medical history, family history, my husband's medical and family history, my cycle . . . what brought us to his office . . . any testing for fertility that we had completed etc . . . <br>  <br>  The doctor told us about his philosophy - his highest multiple pregnancy was one set of quads in 20 years of practice, a handful of triplets and about 30% of his successful births were twins, all other were singletons . . . if we wanted to be the next parents of octuplets . . . we needed to find another doctor.<br>  <br>  We also went over testing that he would want to have done and when it should be scheduled - ie: certain cycle days - you will want to bring a calendar to your appointment.<br>  <br>  We asked a lot of questions - about his experience, staff, hours of the center (working full time meant early morning hours to get testing, ultrasounds and bloodwork done before work was a huge bonus).<br>  <br>  After all of the testing was done, we met with the doctor for a second appointment, reviewed the results and came up with the treatment plan.<br>  <br>  Seriously, bring a notebook and a calendar - write down some of your questions such as hours, payment plans, insurance coverage, testing that they will want to get done, wait time for treatments, philosophy, any alternative support therapies such as acupuncture, nutrionist, counseling etc . . . <br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust!|`|DCKOlH13aa	I just went a few weeks ago and I was so relieved when I left. They made me feel absolutely like I was not crazy. But they asked me a bunch of questions figured out my history and then sent me for a bunch of tests. They were able to narrow it down to a couple of things they thought it was just by talking to me. But it all depends on what your issues are. Mine is extremely irregular cycles and not ovulating. Best of luck...and baby dust!!! Hopefully you too will feel better afterwards and a lot more optimistic. :)|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	They'll probably just go over family history, maybe do a pap smear, ask you some questions. After that they may schedule an appt to check to see whether or not you're ovulating. That's what they did with me. Good luck!
AA11612508	at 5 my daughter was taught to shower and wash hair by herself. It was first trial run, so it was all new. well since i wasnt washing her hair anymore within a month and half she got lice. I know it wasnt from her crappy wash jobs, it was that i wasnt on top of her cleaning schedule and then ididnt realize it.<br>  <br>  So now she still showers her self, we have glass shower doors, so i just come in to bathroom after about ten mins play time, and idirect her how to wash her hair. this was it gets done to my standards and I dont have to do it. sometimes i have to open door and really rinse better but she does a good job now. shes almost 7 thou.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	My daughter is 6 and she bathes and washes her own hair....just not very well.  I often have to rerinse her hair as she doesn't do a very good job of getting all the suds out.  She still takes a bath as well.  When she was 4 she took showers, but then decided to go back to baths.  I wish i could get her to take a shower instead!|`|eeGN977eaa	I had my kids start washing their bodies themselves in the bath when they were 2. When they were 3 I taught them to wash their hair. At 4 they shower and wash independently. <br>  <br>  Your daughter may still need help with her hair depending on how long it is. If you are comfortable with her taking a shower with you that would be a good way to transition. Otherwise have her wash her hair and body by herself in the bath and transition to a shower once she has gotten the hang of it. Maybe stay in the bathroom with her the first couple of times she takes a shower by herself in case she gets scared or needs help.|`|koVk3P9Gaa	My youngest is 6 1/2 and I still wash her too.  My older daughter is 9 and she does an ok job.  I still don't think she washes her hair thoroughly though.  My 6 year old is good about washing her body but I think I will still have to wash her for at least another few months.  I would have your daughter watch you when you shower, show her how you wash her hair and have her try to copy you right after.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Start by letting her wash herself in the tub, with your supervision. Then transition to the shower.<br>  <br>  My daughter and I did a 'dry run' with our bathing suits on in the shower (go naked if you are ok with that)<br>  <br>  I showed her how the controls worked, where to start washing, how much shampoo to use, etc.<br>  <br>  I would wash her hair in the tub once a week to make sure it was getting clean (she had hair to her tush) but the rest of the time, she did it alone.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	My daughter has been taking her own baths since she turned 4, she wouldn't have it any other way. However, she's not your typical 5 year old, she is very meticulous.  She actually does a better job than my 11 year old in the bath.  I would start letting your daughter do her own thing but just make sure she is getting it down right.  <br>  <br>  My daughters love to listen to music when they shower, maybe you could use that somehow to get her started.|`|d8ATUY76aa	yea. my 3 year old brother does eveything by himself it helps them to become independent
wObFm9B4aa	Well distract is your only option  <br>  and cognitive ability to recall what is wrong start at 4 years old  punishments for what is unacceptable is not something you hear when talking about babes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OR you COULD GO OLD SCHOOL AND BEAT THAT BABY <br>  <br>  SH!t SH!T what do people really think this is abuse central <br>  <br>  <br>  IT"S A BABY NOT A MONSTER|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Pick your battles wisely<br>  Don't overuse the word No (try to reserve it for safety issues)<br>  Redirect<br>  Distract|`|H2IqzG12aa	The responsibility is on YOU, not on your baby.  It's up to you to child-proof your home, to put locks on kitchen cabinets and keep cables and wires tucked away, electrical outlets covered, etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, you don't punish infants, ever, for any reason.  You watch them and keep them out of harm's way.<br>  <br>  I suggest that a parenting class is overdue before you do something you and your precious baby will regret.|`|zHRWklEWaa	At 8 months he will get into things, so your best bet is to child-proof as much as possible. Then when he inevitably does find something underisrable to play with pick him up, tell him no firmly, move him to a more desirable activity, and remove the offending toy.|`|JwnHKTabaa	Saying "No" sternly is pretty much the best you can do with some patience.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Use the word No - be firm and direct - a little smack on the hand would be appropriate if he is going to do something that will hurt hem.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Ok, first of all, punishment is not the way you want to go, EVER.  You want to DISCIPLINE.  And there is a big difference.  punishment is simply saying, "BAD CHILD."  Discipline is telling them what they did wrong, why is was wrong therefore teaching them and having them gain experience in life.  So keep that in mind as your child grows older.  As for now, there is no punishment or discipline that would be effective.  When the child is this young, DISTRACTION is all you can do.  The child picks up a chokeable item off the floor, you take it, say no gently, then offer something else.  Parenting is a difficult task, especially when the child becomes mobile.  then everything is kind of like a race to see if you can get to your child before they knock over the fish bowl.  But they are like little sponges and they are learning all they can right now and they  learn by example.  you want to teach your child patience and be gentle with the discipline you instill.  be patient yourself.  As your child grows they will be able to understand more of what you what them to do and while things will be tough, it will be worth it if you remember not to punish but to teach.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!  I hope I helped!|`|yKS2UI87aa	Firmly say no and remove him from the situation and redirect his energy on a toy or another activity.|`|sxsx9sHNaa	I didn't start time out and stuff like that until 1/2 year.  Below that they are to little to relmember or understand.. Try redirection, hide the cords, and get child locks.|`|AA12387863	If he reaches for something that could hurt him, grab his hand firmly but gently and say in a firm voice, "NO". No is one of the first words babies learn. Hearing the word no does not make them negative people. It makes them safe.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Redirection. And patience.<br>  And that's all.
AA11294818	cramping was the telling sign for me. It lasted for over 10 days! I know for sure that if I started experiencing those pains again I'd know that I was getting pregnant again. Also within a week of having the baby making sex, I craved FOOD, the types I never eat, and I think I subconsciously knew I was knocked up because instead 1 ounce drinks of jagermeister, I started having 1/4 ounces in my presses for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  There's a good chance. First Response preg. tests work sometimes up to 5 days before your period. Wouldn't hurt to check once you are nearing your period. God bless!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It is normal.  At first it could be the implantation afterwards its your uterus stretching.  If its cramping with no bleeding it definately can mean a baby in your near future.  When you've been on pills as long as we've been (I was on for 10 years) it takes an average of 2-3 months (spoke with my OBGYN)  to regulate and go back to a normal chance of pregnancy (you can always get pregnant sooner but on average).  It took me 3 months exactly so you're about due:-)  Good luck to you.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	it could be, but you were also on the pill for 8 years and just stopped 2 months ago... your body is most likely still adapting to the change and this could take months.<br>  Im not saying you are not pregnant, im just saying not to get your hopes up at this point. It can usually take 6-12 months to get back on track and pregnant after stopping the pill.<br>  Just wait another week, then take a test.|`|HrDcaocMaa	I'd hate to get your hopes up - but I seriously believe that you could be... Whe I came off my birth control ( not for pregnancy reasons - the pill was messing bigtime with my hormones - I was 20 ) the very next period time I became pregnant - You do get this surge of fertility which I wish I would have known back then!!!!  But it's all good!  My son will be 6 this summer!  G??D Luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's probably your body changing after stopping birth control. I would give it a little more time.|`|NNwEuC8paa	for sure!!! they say when you come off the pill you become very fertile, I'd wait a few days before ur period and test! Good luck!!!!

If the tampon is helping, your leaking amniotic fluid and need to go to the hospital.<br>  <br>  Tampons aren't a good idea because they can cause an infection.  You need to put on a regular pad and see how long it takes to soak it.  There is a test they can do at the hospital, they just press a piece of paper to the pad and if it turns colors, it's amniotic fluid.<br>  <br>  You may be having your baby today!|`|Bg6txvxqaa	Why on earth would you use a tampon if you are wetting yourself?<br>  <br>  Urine does not come out of the same place that you place a tampon!<br>  <br>  You could make yourself and your baby ill and even give yourself TSS!! Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) can be fatal so take it out straight away! You should never use a tampon when your not on your period for this exact reason!<br>  <br>  Use a pad or panty liner if you must. <br>  <br>  NEVER USE A TAMPON FOR ANYTHING BUT A PERIOD IN FUTURE!!<br>  <br>  It is bad enough if you weren't pregnant but to endanger your child as well is horrendous!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Pee doesn't come from your vagina.  Use a regular pad.  If it's continual, call the doctor, particularly if it doesn't smell like pee.  It could be your water breaking.

dIW2tVxhaa	Sorry, but I think being fired would be more harmful to your CV than being a mother. Just being honest as an employer :) As to including them in your employment history, well. Thats up to you. Depends what you were fired for!<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your pregnancy x|`|iMULlxdgaa	No just don't include them.  It's ok you don't have to. What wewre the reason's they gave you for being fired?  if they are reasons (ture or not) that make your character look bad I just wouldn't include them and move on with my life, just amke sure you take into consideration what it was that got you fired from the last two jobs.  Don't worry we all live and learn!  Just make sure you learn from your mistakes.  Plus, if your resuming your career in 1.5 years I would just take classes from home or however you like/can do with the baby, and increase my knowledge of the profession I want to be in, that way it looks like you are being productive even tho your staying at home with the kids too.  This will make you look better int eh eyes of an employer!|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I personally don't include jobs i've had for less then 6 months. You need something that looks good on your resume. and if you were fired don't include it. But if they let u go due to not needing u anymore. You can write that as u did nothing wrong. Just word it better when an interviewer asks u about it.|`|sxsx9sHNaa	know what? i was a stay at home mom for awhile, too, and When i interveiw I let employers know i was.

When they can turn over on their own, you don't have to keep going back in to roll them back onto their back.<br>  It's ok to have their heads elevated, the only issue is that anything in the bed can become a suffocation hazard.  Many cribs have an adjustable mattress platform, with my babies I just put one end of the mattress one notch lower than the other end.  This is especially helpful if they are congested, which is very common with infants, especially if they catch a cold.<br>  <br>  All this said, however, I wouldn't push it too much with your sister-in-law.  She probably knows this stuff already, they drum it into your head at the hospital.  She is most likely choosing to ignore what she's been told, which is her prerogative as a parent.  I would just mention it once, what she does after that is up to her.

08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	You can carry on breastfeeding for as long as you like, but it does sound like now is a good time to think about weaning her off it. She's at that difficult age when they start to get demanding, and she's not going to get less demanding any time soon! The longer you leave it, the more difficult it will be to start weaning, and trying to deal with an angry older toddler who is being deprived of their long-established "comforter" is much harder than dealing with a younger child. The longer the habit goes on, the more established it becomes, and the more "deprived" she'll feel. If she wasn't demanding it constantly, I'd be more inclined to say that it's fine to wait as long as you like before weaning her, but it sounds like she's started to develop a more unhealthy relationship with breastfeeding, and if you give in to her demands you might be setting up more intractable problems for later. Breastfeeding is a wonderful, natural thing, and anyone who says you shouldn't be feeding your daughter breastmilk at this age is just plain wrong; however, that is a totally separate issue to dealing with a child who has developed a more unreasonable attitude to breastfeeding. At some time or another, you are going to have to wean her, and if you let things continue the way they are it's going to be very hard work!<br>  <br>  You don't say how often you actually breastfeed her at the moment, are you still doing it on demand? If so I think you need to start reducing the number of feeds per day, aiming to have just one feed a day eventually. I weaned mine by reducing it to bedtime feeds only, then gradually switching to milk from a sippy cup as a bedtime drink (this can be combined with a pleasant change to her bedtime routine, such as reading a bedtime story if you don't do that already). Does she drink milk from a cup? You could always try giving expressed milk from a cup when she demands a feed, as it would be easier for her to deal with having the familiar taste even if she can't have the "comforter" of the breast. You can cuddle her, sing to her, rock her, whatever, while she's drinking from the cup to give her the sense of closeness & security she'll be missing from breastfeeding. I always think the trick with making change easy for kids is to do things gradually, and find ways of replacing whatever it is they're getting from the old "habit" (actually, this is very similar to the process of habit change in adults too!). Distraction works wonders as well! Have fun things lined up for her to do whenever she'd normally have breastmilk, or just have a change of scene. If there's a pattern to the times when she's most likely to want to feed, try changing her routine slightly so the normal triggers for wanting breastmilk aren't there.<br>  <br>  She'll get used to the idea eventually, but it might not be easy initially. Don't forget, though, that children will often react badly to a change at first, but within a few weeks they'll generally have adjusted. You just need iron nerves to get through it!! Honestly, though, you can feel like a horrible parent, and can be brought to tears, but then a week later they're absolutely fine and you wonder what all the fuss was about!|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	First, it's perfectly normal that you're still nursing your 18-month-old, and it's normal that she's asking to nurse more frequently.  Kids go through phases of being more independent and more clingy, wanting to nurse more/less, etc.  It's all normal.<br>  <br>  I nursed my oldest until she was 14 1/2 months old (and I was 6 months pregnant with baby #2).  I nursed my middle child until she was 2 1/2 years old (and I was 6 months pregnant with baby #3).  <br>  <br>  My 18-month-old is still nursing anywhere from 5-10 times per day (1-3 of those at night).  He also eats three meals of solids and a couple snacks per day.  If we're home and not too busy, he asks to nurse more often.  If we're out and he's playing a lot, he doesn't ask to nurse as much.  He's also more inclined to nurse if he's overwhelmed or tired or hurt.  It's all normal, and I'm in no rush to fully wean him.  I do distract him from time to time with a drink or snack or cuddle if it's not convenient to nurse him at that moment or if I'm just feeling "touched out."<br>  <br>  I said all that because I don't want you to think you have to wean if you and your daughter aren't ready.  If you decide to go ahead and start weaning, take it very slow.  Drop one nursing session at a time, starting with the least important (to her) and saving the most important for last (probably right before bed or first thing in the morning).  Only drop one session per week or so, and take things gradually, offering lots of cuddles and extra snacks/drinks as needed.  It's also possible to get her down to just 1-2 nursing sessions per day without fully weaning if that's something you're interested in.<br>  <br>  Here are some more weaning tips...<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weaning_techniques.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weani...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/index...</a><br>  <br>  And benefits of extended breastfeeding if you decide to continue...<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/bfextended/ebf-benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/bfextended/eb...</a>|`|0ky4TktEaa	Yes it's about time. Once your child switches over to solids, it's been time to give up the breastfeeding. You start weaning by limiting the feeding to ONLY at night. Do that for maybe a week at most. After a week, use a breast pump, put the milk in a sippy cup for her to drink. After a few days of that, stop completely; switch her over to regular milk. <br>  <br>  Be prepared for some screaming and throwing fits. Some children do well; others need MUCH more time to get over it. As long as you don't cave and give it to her, she'll get over it. She won't just "not" eat. Some kids will refuse to eat hoping you'll eventually give in. DO NOT do this. She will eat when she realizes she won't get breastfed. Good luck.|`|FD14nOKoaa	Yes, it's OK.  Do you WANT to wean her?  If not, keep nursing.  I nursed all mine passed this age.  When I did wean, I was mostly nursing at nap time and nights, so I let my husband be the one to put the child to sleep and I dried up pretty quickly because my supply always got low after a year.  There are great book from La Leche League about nursing and weaning toddlers.  Godd luck!
ZvPJjme9aa	my son is 19 mnths old and had this prob at 16 months.<br>  i put him to bed earlier as he used to go to bed at 8 so i changed it to 6.30.<br>  he now sleeps well and will sometimes sleep till 10|`|T0r5hofiaa	Im also having this problem! I have a 10 month old who goes down between 6:30-7pm and wakes up at 5:30 most days. I have started just leaving him in his bed until 6:00 and most of the time he will go back to sleep. My advice is to go in and check on her when she wakes up at 5am, change diaper, nurse, whatever you need to do. Then lay her back down and turn on the noise machine and tell her you will be back in 30 minutes. She will soon realize after several mornings that she needs to stay in bed until 6. Start your morning routine at the same time everyday so she knows what to expect. Starting out it will be 5 diaper change, back to bed until (atleast) 6, breakfast at 6:30, playtime, nap, etc. This takes time and patience! Good Luck Mommy!|`|FD14nOKoaa	I'm with you.  My 18 month old gets up at 5 also, but she goes to bed at 7pm.  Until her second birthday, your child should get about 14 hours of sleep a day, 11 of those hours at night. The rest will come in nap form. He'll still need two naps at 12 months, but by the time he's 18 months old, he may be ready for a single hour-and-a-half to three-hour nap in the afternoon — a pattern he may follow until he's four or five.  Your child's circadian rhythm is waking her up at 5am, and it will change on its own, or not.  I am ok with my child getting up at 5, because I go to work early and she has to be at daycare by 630am.  Good luck!

1thzSbS8aa	You can't be sure until 2-4 weeks later, when you take a pregnancy test.
ZYlr9TSBaa	Yes it does get better! Soon you'll be showing, you'll be feeling your bub move around - the second trimester is known as the "honeymoon" period as icky first trimester symptoms tend to go away.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i woke up at 13weeks and 2 days and felt amazing, trust me, it gets better :D|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Tired will come go and come back at the last trimester.  Emotional part will last the entire pregnancy and most likely long after the baby.  Depends on the person.  Your hormomes are out of wack from being preg.  Yes it gets better.  You will meet your baby for the first time at 37-40 weeks and your life will change.  It is truly a miracle once you have him/her.|`|AA12192295	I'm 11 weeks and all the books say i should be feeling more energy and less sickness.

I am fully over motion sickness though, I got that about 2 weeks after my missed period and had it for about 6 weeks, was constantly nauseous but only threw up maybe four times. I haven't been emotional really at all, I have a lot of stress (money worries) that made me cry a lot anyways, I dont think hormones have made it much worse. Maybe I am just lucky, but you should honestly start to feel better soon.|`|xhOulzZ7aa	All very normal, don't stress it will get better soon, over the next few weeks women usually get more energy and are less tired, until the last month or so when it all happens again.

Go with the traditional spelling.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i never likes that name and i really don't like the spelling|`|KOcCenrEaa	I can't pronounce it so that's a big no.<br>  It doesn't help it looks misspelled and made up.|`|8WbfmK5daa	Is that an alternatie spelling to Sophia? If it is I like the name but not that spelling.<br>  <br>  I know a Zofia which is an alternative spelling and people don't misprounce her name.<br>  <br>  You could also use<br>  <br>  Sofia<br>  Zophia|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Is that sophia?If so I like it.|`|0Xl9BLOdaa	I think it's pretty!|`|YvNOfM2xaa	Lovely name! But the spelling could be changed to make it look nicer.<br>  For example Most Sopheya's spell their name Sophia. Although  I like unique spellings I like Sophia.

207ab97f602d37e3bc8232e9d45d43fdaa	This is not a miscarriage.  A miscarriage is where your body rejects your baby and miscarries it.  An abortion is when a outside source is used to voluntarily terminate the pregnancy.  I've aborted but for other reasons.  If you feel despair now, you will always.  You'll need to seek counseling afterwards.  If this is something that you are truly worried about you may try getting a second opinion before going through with it.  Or if the chances are as low as they say for the ectopic pregnancy then just wait it out.   Allow your body to miscarry on it's own.  Doctors aren't always right.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	this happened to my sister, they told her that they were giving her the shot and she told them no-that if the baby was going to die, then it would be naturally. and she waited it out and ended up carrying a gorgeous little girl to term! she's now two, and the whole family is glad my sister was so hard headed!!|`|BO28Mn8haa	I'm really sorry for your loss|`|KNxs4PrZaa	my situation was a little different, but they also told me i was misscarrying even though i hadnt started bleeding, they said hormones where low and there was no heartbeat, i was schedule to have the procedure done to misscarry the pregnancy, i insisted that we wait one more week and see what happens and sure enough everything was fine, we did another scan and there was a heartbeat and i am now 30 weeks and baby is healthy.  it turns out i had ovulated very late in my cycle and was just not as far along as they were calculating.  i cant say that this will be the case for you, but i would reccomend not rushing into anything, let your body have some time to let nature take its course, if you are going to misscarry you will, but i wouldnt rush to get the injection just incase, its still very early in pregnancy.  i hope it tuns out well for you good luck.
JT4OSUPeaa	Oh gosh, I think it's just Wednesday, I was thinking about asking this question. I walked out without my engagement ring and Colten's whole diaper bag, seriously. Good thing our house is just right down the street from where we live and my fiance works close. His daycare was calling me saying we didn't bring him anything.<br>  <br>  I don't think it ever goes away.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	Yes. It's permanent, you know.<br>  I'm still adjusting to motherhood in general. (My oldest is eleven.)<br>  <br>  I have recently noticed that everytime I have all children in the car and think I'm ready to go, I have to go back in for something I forgot (often the keys). Usually twice.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	I brought this concern up with my doctor, a few years a go, before I even had kids, and he said it is completely normal and comes with age...I was only 29!!!  So, it is probably just a coincidence that you are experiencing it now...apparently it is normal.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	I'm still suffering from Mommy Brain, and my kids are 14 and 10.<br>  <br>  I plan on using it for an excuse when they leave home, too. It's better than saying it's because I'm getting old :).|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	lol Des.<br>  <br>  My Doctor is currently trying to have me put in a white padded room, so I am avoiding her like the plague.<br>  It's debatable whether I ever had a brain.|`|vLJKNkNLaa	It sounds like you are just overwhelmed.<br>  Im 14 and my mom still has mommy brain.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I had something to add but I forgot what I was going to say....|`|M9wAOlk3aa	i think as long as you are a mummy you have mummy brain|`|ad99276137754d78c3e466f9cfade285aa	I had my first 17 yrs ago (teen mom) and never got my pre-baby brain back! lol.

Dylan is 2 yrs old and my head is always spinning. I think it’s because I need to SLOW DOWN. But I’m always in a rush. It’s what I do. <br>  <br>  Don’t worry, we’re all the same. How we still manage to keep track of our kids is beyond me?? LOL.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I sometimes leave without essentials too...I think so long as we have kids we will suffer from mommy brain lol... sometimes there is too much going and we forget. Can you put some extra silverware in the car for extras?<br>  <br>  now its the silverware... then they are older it will be the balls for soccer, basketball, & baseball practice or god forbid their cup...|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	LOL!  <br>  <br>  On a serious note, when I started doing things like that, I also noticed I was feeling funny, too.  That's when my doctor did bloodwork and found out that I have a thyroid problem that was the culprit.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I'm so glad you said something! I still have it and Olivia is 14 months. I think it goes away after they move out. and then old age sets in.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Here's my theory. When I was pregnant, a good 2/3 of my brain cells went directly to Bella in utero. They left me permanently. I say this because I forget the most basic things almost daily...
VwMkiLFPaa	I’m soooo thankful that I started Dylan on water at 3 months. (Per pedi’s okay) He never got juice, mostly water. And when he did start to get juice, it was half water, half juice…yet he still seemed to prefer water. He’ll chug an entire sippy cup of water in a second (chocolate milk in .25 seconds LOL). <br>  <br>  Juice is fine during the day as long as you water it down. And MAYBE even try gradually watering it more than juicing it. That way he can get more of a water fix than a juice fix And MAYBE your day will come when he’ll take a whole cup of water. LOL.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Milk twice a day is good.  Supplement that with cheese, yogurt and other dairy products.  Chase loves cottage cheese.<br>  <br>  Chase drinks and drinks and drinks all day long.  It doesn't matter what you give him, he'll drink it.  Juice (any kind), milk (any kind), ginger ale when he's sick.  He drinks so much that I don't want him to have anything else and I'll just give him water and he loves it.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	I have given my son the flavored water juice boxes since he was about 18 months old. they taste like juice, but are not as sugary as regualr juice. I do not give them to him ALL the time, but they are one of his options.<br>  <br>  To encourage milk drinking I allow him to have a small amount of chocolate or strawberry syrup or carnation instant breakfast in his milk. I am talking like a tsp of syrup or a tablespoon of instant breakfast powder in an 8 ounce glass. <br>  <br>  He still has his days when he does not drink as much as I would like him to, but he has other days when he drinks like 3 cups of milk.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	My son doesn't drink any juice.  it is really not good for them.  (I always get thumbs down, but I don't care.)<br>  <br>  Juice is full of sugar and not much else.  It is bad for their teeth, bad because it is filled with calories and they fill up on juice and then don't always want to eat, it often leads to overweight and diabetic children, and it affects their behavior.  It can cause them to be hyperactive which prevents them from learning in certain situations and induces bad attention spans and acting out.<br>  <br>  My son gets white milk or water... he loves both.  We never introduced juice so he doesn't prefer it.  You can say I'm depriving him, but we aren't... he has plenty of years in the rest of his life to eat/drink junk... but not on my watch.|`|AA10529334	I use the 1- 2- 3 method. The first drink of the day is milk, the second water, the third juice. Continue this all day. Tell him no juice till he drinks his water or milk.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	My daughter is three and she's the same way!  I give her watered down juice during the day.|`|qiUo1CTYaa	Personally I limit Juice (diluted) to once a day, with lunch.  The rest of the time it is water and the odd drink of milk.  Nutritionally most Toddlers do not need more than 600ml of milk a day, so if he is having two serves of Milk a day then that is probably enough.  I would definitely continue diluting the juice down as weak as you can if you are offering it frequently.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	Mine drinks a small glass of orange juice or mango nectar in the morning when she wakes (depends on what she's having for breakfast, mostly). A bit of water later on. Usually some milk after lunch/ before nap. When she gets up from her nap she generally has some guava nectar. A little water with dinner.  Small glass of milk before bed.<br>  <br>  I try to give her drinks in-between or after meals, because she will drink until she no longer eats given the option.<br>  <br>  Have you tried a different kind of milk? I wish mine drank less milk, we go thorugh the dairy section at the market and she starts going 'yuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmm  yummmmmmmmmy yuuuuuuuuum'.  :)|`|5jjGo6XTaa	what i do for my 13month old is mike the juice with water just cause the fact i dont need her getting all this suger. i got the idea from her dr when it was time to get her of furmula she also will drink the milk in morning and nights and before a nap i think shed drink it anytime but i like to give a lil somthing different. theres also different kinds of juices u get get your child if u didnt want to mix it with water try the v8 juices my kids love em and there good for u not full of crap like other drinks. good luck|`|PCK5bJt3aa	Juice, juice and more juice..but it is always diluted  50% or more with water and I buy Organic. My rule of thumb is to read the labels and if it has ingredients I can't pronounce then they are not going into her body. My daughter hates milk so I also give her Silk chocolate soy milk (Loaded with vitamins and good source of calcium) and Stony field Organic Yo baby yogurts ( they are made with whole milk so limit the quantity) but they taste so good and again good for Vitamin D and Calcium.|`|0QYIbn1saa	I've read (and my ped told me too) that they shouldn't have more than 4 oz of juice/day.  So maybe you can be sneaky like I am, and mix 1 part juice to 3 parts water, and give that to him a few times throughout the day?<br>  <br>  Hmmm.  I wonder why Johnny doesn't like milk during the day?!  That little stinker!
41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	They will do a reflex check, measure weight, height and head circumference.  They will check all of pieces and parts to make sure they are working correctly.  They will ask you about his progress in all areas of his life to make sure he's on target for his age.  He will give you a big spiel about reading books to him, go over his diet and send you on your way.  I don't think Chase got shots at 15 months.  Who knows?  I can barely remember the date!|`|GZdvHbT5aa	Just about the same as every other check-up. I do think they don't have to have as many shots at this one, though, which is a plus. I do remember at Sam's 15 month check-up, they started really looking into mental development instead of just physical growth, like the previous check-ups. So be prepared to answer a lot of questions!|`|0QYIbn1saa	Eli has his on Friday....I know there are shots involved this time again, although I'm not sure which ones.  Ugh    Hope everything goes well :)  Good luck-
KNxs4PrZaa	i dont know for sure but when i pregnant the first time i was sure it was a girl, i thought about girls names only, looked at girls stuff, dreamt about having a girl all of the time so i was not surpirsed to find out it was infact a  girl. i think its just your intuition .|`|Nux5S6oVaa	I haven't had any dreams as of late.

vOomJtbsaa	No I just couldn't.  There's something so strange about putting a strangers breastmilk into MY childs body.  Can't really say why I couldn't do it, it just wouldn't feel natural to me.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Not from a random stranger, no.. Though there are programs you can sign up for where the women is tested and everything and she can donate her milk.. I would in that case.|`|cv0foxlTaa	No, I wouldn't...  Especially from someone I didn't know.  Even from someone I did know - only in an extreme emergency.|`|GU3RauKOaa	If I needed it and  I knew the person than yes.    Unfortunately, I wouldn't accept it from a stranger... you just never know. They could be taking a medication which they think is safe but is not. You also don't know how clean/sanitary their breast pump and milk freezing containers were.     Its nice of her to offer, but I would offer it to someone who knows me. There are also organizations through which you can donate breastmilk.|`|K36jovxfaa	sorry i don't know|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	No way, even if it were someone I knew. Even if it's your sister, people tell you only what they feel comfortable with telling you.     I guess if I had to I would use a milk bank because all the milk is screened first but that is only in an emergency. If it got that bad I would just use formula.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	I would use it from someone I knew well. I wouldn't from a complete stranger.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	depends - if i knew the person- like my sister or something and my son needded milk. wouldn't be froma  random strager|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Thats just gross. I wouldn't want to give my baby anyones breast milk other than my own.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Not by choice. Only in an emergency.
145RUNQHaa	Totally normal behaviour.there are a number of reasons this occurs and he probably only does it to you because you're the one he trusts the most and is most comfortable with.he's either teething,frustrated,doing it for a reaction,learning about cause and effect or attention seeking.smacking would make things a lot worse and biting back is just plain horrible you are right not to do those things.he's little more than a baby and you are there to set a an example to him so being calm and gentle is a must.what i've found to work is to distract initially pull him away from you and just divert his attention with anything you feel may grab his attention such as pointing to a bird out of the window and have a chat to him so he doesn't carry on with the biting then while you are chatting show him where he's bitten and ask him to kiss it better praise him if he does.this will teach him about empathy.he probably doesn't realise he's hurting you and in his little mind he may see it as a way of expressing affection like someone said that is the exact same way a puppy plays and shows love they mouth you.a lot of parents make the mistake of retaliating and then there's a loss of trust and a bad example has been set i find the behaviour goes away when you stay calm and don't stress about it.remember it's all normal most go through that stage.hope this helps.x|`|ibeYAlwpaa	have you tried time out?  I have a 14 month old and i cant imagine her sitting in timeout but if she were a biter i'd try it ( because i also dont agree with biting back and im defly not trying to go the route of smacking my kid) .|`|0ky4TktEaa	Until you give him a better reason to stop than your complaining about it, he's not going to stop. I don't agree with biting back as that's just inappropriate all around. Smacking...now there's something that works. Not a POW! Just enough to get their attention and let them know that they DO NOT bite you. If you don't agree with it, you aren't going to do it. And you'll keep getting bitten until you do more than just keep repeating no. Apparently, "no" isn't working very well as he continues to do it. <br>  <br>  Even if he's teething or needs something to chew on, he needs to know that his mother's not it.|`|AA10152346	I have the exact same problem. I'm kind of thankful he doesn't bite anybody else. My older daughter had the same thing but she used to bite everybody. not a good thing at daycare or the playground. They will outgrow it eventually.<br>  <br>  My 24 month old son bites when he's either too tired or too happy (like a puppy).<br>  <br>  Sorry not much advise here, except wait it out. I tried everything with my daughter and it never helped any so I'm just letting my son be until he's out of it as well. The last time my daughter bit someone it was her cousin a year ago when she was 3 years and 3 months old.
Ybo6HS8Caa	I have done that exact thing many times.  I also hate to punish the ones who didn't mess up, but this way also helps them, I think.  I say that because when one child has caused the others to be "in trouble", the other kids will be sure to let the offender know how they felt about being punished for someone else's crime....and the more often I have handled situations this way, the less often they end up trying to hide it.  Trust me, it is not fun when your siblings are mad at you and don't want to play with you because you got them in trouble.  As a result, they don't let the others get in trouble for what they did as often (at least in my house).|`|SNllynBiaa	I would take each child alone and sit them down and ask them. You should be able to tell which one is telling the truth.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	The only down side I see to this is that someone may not be truthful and say that they did it in order to spare everyone else and end the punishment. Other than that it seems fine to me.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	thats what I would do. though i wouldnt let them get together and discuss it before someone confesses|`|H74F8jxuaa	I would say they should all be grounded for longer because they don't mind being in their room for a little bit and when the one confesses they are all free.  Maybe if they all got punished the same, they would tell on the guilty party.    On a side note, if you all had dinner together, then you could make sure they didn't eat in their room?  Just a thought.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Thats how my mom handled it with 3 kids.  although sometimes as the oldest i would just confess so everyone could just move on.  btw - if you want ant advice, let me know.  i had a crazy ant problem and I think I finally figured out how to get rid of the nasty little buggers.  *knock on wood!!*  haven't had an issue in like a year.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	You gotta do what you gotta do.  Sounds reasonable to me.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I'm not sure how to answer this question, but thank you so much for making me laugh this morning.  I love that "not me" did it.  Anyway, if it works for you.  I have a way of dragging the truth out of my kids.  I can almost always tell who's lying and get it out of them without having to go to such extremes.  My daughter has a tendency to show a slight smile when she's laughing.  That's an easy tell.|`|AA11131747	My mother did this when I was a child. The problem - the child who most desperately wanted out of the punishment was the one to confess. It was rarely the one who committed the offense.|`|AA11755924	I think you are doing the right thing.  We have problems like that at home with my 3 kiddos.  They will be playing upstairs rough and then someone gets hurt.  My 4 yr old likes to blame it on my 8 yr old so I have the , "Mommy Jayden hit me" and then Jayden busts out with, "No I didn't!  He ran into the wall himself!"  So we get the belt out and ask again, "What happened?  Someone is lying and if someone doesn't tell the truth, you are all going to get spanked."    Then my 4 yr old quickly admits, "Jayden didn't hit me, I fell."|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I wouldn't do that... Resentment will build between the children, which will lead to more arguments (What mom needs that? LOL!), not to mention the resentment it will cause them to feel for you.     I have this issue with my kids, as well, and I just keep talking to them about it, until the guilty party admits it... Sometimes, I just leave it alone, telling them it had better not happen, again, cause, really, what's done is done, and if it's not *too* big an issue, I let the small stuff go... If I punished all my kids for everything ONE of them did wrong, they would all be in their rooms, all day, and I'd never see them!    But, of course, the choice is yours. I just would have been bitter as heck, at my mom, and my siblings, if she'd chosen to punish us that way.|`|Lor20kXcaa	talk about who ddid it, together?    of course they're not going to bully or threaten each other.    You're never going to punish the one that did it, just the one that the others can get to admit it.    What they'rew learning is that it doesn't matter, because someone else will pay.    You need to find out who actually ate, without giving the others time to male someone confess.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	They used to do that when I was in school, make everyone miss recess until someone confessed.  More than once my whole class sat on the wall at recess for me, that was never enough to get me to tell.  If I never confessed they'd never know it was me.    How about not letting them into the room until someone confesses?  It's the same basic concept but it was more of an inconvenience for me to be grounded FROM my room because that's where most of my toys were and you'd have to let me out for dinner and to go to the bathroom anyway, so everything I needed was in my room.  Separating them might help too, might make them squirm, too.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	I think it is completely reasonable.  Sometimes peer pressure is necessary in the home.|`|jQnxo57yaa	So. Guess what?  Your not the only mom who does that.  I remember when i was younger someone would break something or you know kid stuff get in to something we shouldn't something of that sort and none of us "did it"  So my mom used to make us all stay in our room until one of us would confess.  being the youngest until i was 10 i would be the one who would confess most of the time.   I would just make sure that the same one isn't confessing all the time.  I know i'm not a mom but i have been in the shoes of your kids.  hopefully this helps.
TXddP0uxaa	I think it is a combination of things.  I think she has to be mentally ill to some extent, and I also think that she wanted the attention, whether it meant cash or not (of course, she is over $900,000 in debt, so a big pay day had to be on her mind).  I think there needs to be more stringent guidelines for this sort of thing in the future.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	my thoughts on this story continue to be that one person's reproductive life, whether admirable or not, is not worthy of national news and is absolutely none of my business.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I don't think this was an elaborate ploy to get on welfare (as it wont be enough to care for all the kids). Her mom said she was obsessed with having children, I  think she has a psychological disorder of some kind that should be attended to.    I know she had the last ones because she didn't want the embryos destroyed but she had to know having 14 kids by herself would be a monumental task. That to me indicates a problem...|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Selfish, disqusting, and sick.|`|1hciyvKdaa	That Dr will most likely be brought up before the medical board. This was so bizarre. I feel so bad for all the children. I bet social services is going to be hot on her trail, she may even lose custody of all those kids, how sad is that for the little ones at home that really need to be together. Sickening, just sickening.|`|mXtsmTdaaa	I am completely appalled by this woman.  This was her intentions all along..  Anyone with common sense would know if that your single and already have 6 children having 8 more is a bad idea. Unless you are having them to make money.... which in that case its exploiting your children..... i am so disgusted!  UGH!!!!|`|723QHuicaa	Well no one else would do it for free why should she? she has 14 mouths plus her own to feed for goodness sake!    Once you are ''perfect'' then offer judgement, until then, dont be bitchy.|`|zhk8o514aa	Not forgetting that she lives with her parents and doesn't have a job.|`|kn2glb6zaa	I think you are all a bunch of judgmental cows with nothing better to do than chew your cud. Leave her alone.|`|iDpaNboCaa	I always thought that people that do stuff like this are looking for media attention and a free meal ticket.  She' s gonna get it one way or the other.|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	i think that the fact that she lives with her mom and doesnt have a job is sick.....like what the hell...here we are telling teenagers to wait to have sex because they wount be able to do it a nd look at her......she not only risked her life but the life of her children as well....i find it selfish and rude....shes lucky all thise babies made it....and she shouldnt be aloud to have more.....ppl who are working are basically paying to raise her kids while she sits at home and does what...mothers them...but is more then capable to work....i dont find it fair that this women who has alreay haslike 6 kids should be aloud to have more and then use media and god knows what else tomake the money to raise them....she knew this was going to go all over the place and knew she could get money out of it....RUDE and SELFISH!!!!!!!thats all i can say!!|`|PwrF9OtWaa	this is ridiculous.   by law you're only allowed four animals, but it's ok to have 14 kids?|`|xRJQSNJeaa	I dont know. I just think there is something really fishy with the whole getting pregnant with eight babies at once and not having a husband then having six other kids under the age of nine at home. The mother said that she's been obsessed with having kids or being around kids since she was a teenager. The mother also said that once her daughter comes home from the hospital she's leaving. And that she needs to stop having babies. I think that if she wanted so many kids she should've became a kindegarten teacher or something of that sort. The mother also said she should have gotten married but it was her choice and she didn't and went and had 14 kids. I personally think that she has a form of OCD. Obsessive Compulsive disorder which she is being obessive about having all these kids and she need to get help or she end up being a single mom with like 30 kids. I think every baby a person has is a blessing but if somebody is having baby after baby because they want to they arent going to grow up in a good stable enviroment thats my opinion.|`|hkQSqPEwaa	How can you take care of 14 kids and still live with your parents???
TQW5E6olaa	You know....I think we should eat out of the pan we cooked the food in with our hands....No silverware, no plates, very green!!! Great idea :)|`|oP504BtFaa	Regular plates and silverware are better for the environment than disposable. Disposable plates make more garbage, obviously, and usually don't decompose easily. It's paper or plastic - both are hard to break down.<br>  <br>  Dishwashers are better for the environment than hand-washing dishes (depending on the size of your family and amount of dishes you use, but generally speaking, they are) especially if you have an energy efficient one.<br>  <br>  While eating with one's hands would be more green since there would be no clean up of silverware, I don't think it's very sanitary! I'm sure they'd LOVE that, ha ha. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a dishwasher (and if you hate dishes, I would think you don't - dishes with a dishwasher are possibly the easiest thing ever) then I suggest you start putting away money to buy one. It will make your life SO much easier and be easier on the environment.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I hate the "green" advertising and propoganda.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is teach your children to be responsible.  They don't need to buy fancy gadgets, they don't need to participate in "green" activities... they just need to be responsible.<br>  <br>  Don't litter - don't waste - recycle - use reusable items, rather than one time items - buy what you need and no more - never throw something away that can be used again - etc.<br>  <br>  To answer your question... reusing your dishes is better for the environment than throwing out paper plates after each use.  Where do they go?  Landfill?  Don't use serving dishes... go buffet style from the kitchen (why dirty an extra dish?)|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Being in the Remodeling Biz I live the Green way with Customers everyday But its My Kids that Come home and say We should do this and Do that to Be Green, Its Nice to see that they are actually teaching Good things In School Besides the basics<br>  <br>  And Using Plates is Green, Using paper plates is not.<br>  If you Don't Like Doing Dishes Just eat out everynite lol|`|prqrQcd1aa	LOL, i despise dishes as well as laundry..but it's something that we have to deal with. If you can buy foods that don't require any kind of plates that need to be put in the trash can great, if you can do it too that don't need to be washed, even greater!<br>  I've been known to give my kids pizza to eat on the table or chicken strips and similar things...with no plate at all..eat with your hands... I just make shure the table is clean, and their hands are too!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	It's easier for us, because guess what?<br>  <br>  When our water runs out, it runs out. There is not more. If we don't have rain, I can't feel my tanks up.<br>  <br>  Serious for a moment. It really annoys me, when people say they spend 20 minutes in a shower. It really does. I can shower in less than 3 minutes, why can't they?<br>  Too serious.<br>  <br>  Do what I do, pitch a tent and eat off the land. Those grubs are yummy.|`|lzB6Amiuaa	Teaching your children to conserve also teaches them other things...such as taking only what you need and caring for something greater than yourself. Using disposable plates, in my opinion, is not "green" because if they are paper you are using up more trees and if they are plastic you are filling the landfills. Unless maybe they are made of recycled products. All paper products in our home are from a brand that uses recycled products.|`|p419TVeVaa	I think its very important to try and teach the next generation to be green after all they are the ones inheriting the planet from us and we have abused and messed up this earth pretty badly. I have my five year old son help me to sort out the recycling and he thinks its a great game, I have also taught him about composting and using the organics bin which is used in our community. We use cloth bags for our groceries and we walk just about everywhere... not only good for the environment but good for burning off his energy as well LOL! Anyways I think you are doing an awesome teaching your children to respect the environment and trying to live green!
j2mRop0laa	Well, the very few friends that I have are polar opposites of me and my parenting. You know where I'm from and you can imagine. It's sort of a bible belt with spanking and lots of religion etc.<br>  They just sort of think I'm a hippy for being a vegetarian, using time out and talking everything out. But.. we respect each other.We try not to roll our eyes at each other, too much. haha<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I'm able to see that they are good parents and I hope they think the same of me and that's it.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I have some fringe friends with different views than mine, but I do find myself gravitating more towards like-minded people. I also find that different friends are fun for different activities. I have a friend who is horrified that I eat pork, so I'll never invite him for dinner. But he loves to have religious discussions so I really enjoy talking about that with him. <br>  <br>  I know one person who is a real jerk, he can't have a discussion about anything without turning it into an argument. He's very cynical. But I have to admit, I like arguing with him. It's all in good fun.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I interact with a great number of people who's opinions and beliefs are different then mine. Religion, culture,parenting styles, Even hobbies. I encourage my kids to do the same. The more your exposed to different thins the more you learn.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Not so much, beside my sarcastic sister of course :)<br>  <br>  I like having contacts/friends all over the board, different situations, different ideas, etc. I like being exposed to thoughts different than mine|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I believe in God but I'm not religious. I don't have strong political views but I love being around people who do differ in their political and religious beliefs just because I find their reasons for what they believe in to be interesting and thought-provoking. My friends and I differ in our parenting styles. I'm the odd ball. But I've always been a bit "off centre" so that's not surprising. I'm the only one who is breastfeeding a toddler, used cloth nappies, isn't big on routine or structure and who is feeding her child mainly organic and all vegetarian foods. I'm sure we probably have different ideas on discipline too but frankly I don't dwell or particularly care how they are raising their children because their children are gorgeous, healthy, happy, out-going and well-behaved as is my son, some of the time. We tend not to talk much about parenting styles, more just the cute stuff our children are doing/saying and we talk about every other subject other than our children. I interact with a huge variety of people.|`|prqrQcd1aa	In the "real" world.. I interact more with people who have the same parenting philosophies, similar politics, not so much religious views (some yes, some no), morals...YES, values...YES.<br>  <br>  On the internet.. pretty much yes with the parenting philosphies, politics (i've recently found out lol), religious views ( i believe so), morals ( yeah, for the most part), values (Yes, for the most part). <br>  <br>  I am able to communicate with others that have vastly different views and opinions on things on occasion..like when they need help, or they are confused about something..|`|FLpMShKNaa	I am able to interact with others. The key really isn't your philosophy, but how accepting you are. My paralegal is very conservative and in the NRA, and I am more liberal and afraid of guns. We really get along and just tread lightly about politics. My good work friend has similar political views but we have different parenting styles. Its fine because unlike a few  of the moms on here, we don't see fit to tell the other one how wrong they are and how right we are. So, again, I think it depends on whether the person is a live and let live type or really overbearing.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	i have friends and acquaintances from all walks of life. but i tend to be closer with people who have have something in common with me. whether it's religion or breastfeeding or AP parenting or organic living...those things don't necessarily go hand in hand =D<br>  <br>  a perfect example would be my sweet and sexxxy hubby! we share the same family values of course, but are polar opposites on most political views! LOL another major difference is i was raised Roman Catholic and he is Southern Baptist!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	definitely similar parenting philosophies.  as far as politics and religion, i don't care - it doesn't come up often enough in any form other then 'i just got back from church, i just read this.. " nothing to debate over. <br>  yes, morals and values.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I think I interact with like minded people because I met them through activities which interest us. We disagree on a few things but generally have similar values. I don't know if I would be compatible with friends who were dramatically different from me.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	I am able to be friends or interact with people who have vastly different views/opinions|`|5p7gpj36aa	short answer -- both.  though I am with mostly those that are similar... sometimes when you have someone that's different, you have no idea what you might explore!|`|AA10200874	I find it easier and less stressful when interacting with people who are like minded as you have described. As regarding interacting with unlike minded ppl, it is an unfamiliar territory and I have to be very accepting of others to do it. If itr is unavoidable, I have to do it, but will not be the same degree of openness. <br>  <br>  But again, if you interact with everybody, you need to have strength not to be influenced subtly, into ways of life disagreeable to you, e.g; a very loyal person and a free sex type of person, a teetotaller and a habitual drinker.<br>  <br>  I feel only a person who has found and experienced the basic unity of all beings may be able to interact alike with all.<br>  <br>  Good question !|`|ddP3klT3aa	I like people with their own opinions. But I would never be friends with some one who hurt their children.<br>  All my friends have their own ideas. My husband does even. We have similar views in some things, but not every thing. I like people who are true to themselves and don't just agree with every one to be liked.<br>  I have one friend who is a church goer and she is not afraid to admit it. I don't have "fake" friends.<br>  My friends may do things differently than I do as far as parenting, but they are accepting. My baby is happy and healthy. I would not tell my friends how to raise their children and they wouldn't tell me how to raise mine.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Not at all, but for sure.<br>  <br>  My real life friends, get me. We are not the same, we are all unique, but we get each other.<br>  None of my friends share my Religious view, maybe a few of my morals, but yeah.<br>  <br>  It doesn't worry me, at all. We all get along just fine.<br>  <br>  On here, well I am at the moment the most hated pair of heels in the world. ;)<br>  I like people, and am attracted to people who are different, who do have their own ways, and are proud of those ways. Basically who are their own person, and know how to have a laugh.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I asked a question about this a while ago. I met another mummy recently and thought she was great. We have a lot in common and lots to chat about... then I discovered a couple of her (very radical) views that really shook me up. When I asked on here, most people said that it shouldn't affect how I feel, and we can still be friends. The more honest people around me (my direct friends and family) have said that they probably couldn't get past it themselves... I'm still undecided to be honest.<br>  Generally speaking, I'll talk to anyone. But I think it's human nature to move towards those you have more in common with - most of my friends now have children, this happened since becoming a mum myself. They're usually stay at home mums too, but that's likely because we then have the time to meet up! Only that one time have I ever felt like someone's views were too far out for me too cope with. I'm a talk before I think kinda person (which is why typing suits me better - lol) so I'm not sure I can trust myself not to say something that could offend her...<br>  Good question.|`|H93JbQS0aa	We grow up with like minded families and make friends usually from child to adult, only time this changes is when you move around or someone from other back grounds come to your environment. Sometimes its harder to accept other views prefer to hang around with like minded pple and build ur society on that.<br>  Thanks,|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I was the girl in high school who was friends with everyone and was always taking up for the ones who were picked on.<br>  <br>  I still find myself interacting with people with all different types of views.  However, I do find that I have more in common with those closest to me.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	in the real world? very much so.  not to say that i don't have friends with whom i disagree on religion or politics or parenting philosophy or something, because of course i do, but i am certainly drawn to people i admire, and generally speaking the people i admire share my morals and values.  and since the activities i tend to get involved with in my free time tend to attract people with the same views i have, the people i tend to meet by definition tend to be rather like me in some ways.<br>  <br>  i do understand that it's certainly limiting that people tend to self-select friends who are like them and so don't get a tremendous amount of exposure to other viewpoints.  that's actually one of the things i like about this board.  on here, i've had interactions with people with pretty vastly different ideas and value systems than mine.
zhJOZhKEaa	Every step 'up' in carseats is a step down in safety... even adult race car drivers still use a 5 point harness because it is safer in a crash.  So leave him in a harnessed seat *as long as possible*... experts recommend waiting till a child is *at least* 4 yrs old and 40 pounds.<br>  <br>  With him being that large already I would certainly recommend getting him a seat that will keep him harnessed past 40 pounds.  He won't be mature enough when he hits 40 pounds to stay seated properly in a booster seat.  Many experts recommend harnessing much longer than 40 pounds at any age... but it is particularly important if a child reaches that weight earlier than 4 yrs.<br>  <br>  This page will show you some great seats that will do this: <a href="http://www.cpsafety.com/articles/Over40.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsafety.com/articles/Over40....</a>  Something like the Graco Nautilus on that page will even convert to a booster when he is unable to fit the harness anymore.<br>  <br>  And then... when you *do* go to booster mode... leave him in that booster till he *fits* an adult belt.  Fit is determined by the '5 step test' found here: <a href="http://www.carseat.org/Boosters/630.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carseat.org/Boosters/630.htm</a>  Age, weight, height... they are all factors that affect fit... and they are the factors that laws are often written by... but the fit itself is what is important.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|AA10700407	by weight, not by age.  if he doesn't fit in a car seat, you can buy a booster seat.  my son had one so he could use the seat belt more comfortably and see out the window.|`|8RfmosODaa	I think it is by weight.

After this they must use an adult seat belt. There are very few exceptions, and the main ones are set out below. <br>  <br>  It is the driver's responsibility to ensure that children under the age of 14 years are restrained correctly in accordance with the law.<br>  <br>  Children up to 3 years old<br>  <br>  <br>  In the Front Seat<br>  <br>  The child MUST use the correct child restraint.<br>  <br>  It is illegal to carry a child in a rear-facing child seat in the front, which is protected by an active frontal airbag. <br>  <br>  In the Rear Seat <br>  <br>  The child MUST use the correct child restraint.<br>  <br>  In a licensed taxi or licensed hire car, if a child restraint is not available then the child may travel unrestrained in the rear. This is the only exception for children under 3, and has been introduced for practical rather than safety reasons. You should always think about ways to make sure that a child seat is available.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is the driver's legal responsibility to ensure that the child is correctly restrained.|`|8tGAE1Nmaa	when they get to be 5 yrs old or 88 inches tall... leave him in a car seat for a couple more years but u may have to move him to a booster seat to accompany his growing height so he isnt uncomfortable...|`|8f85dcd92e8f3f82943075a31b9dd135aa	It goes most importantly by age first, regardless of size. Then factor in maturity. The LAST thing to look at is size. I'm with you - my son was only 2 when he outgrew all the 40lbs seats at Walmart. But that meant I had to go looking for a seat that would hold him in a 5 point harness until he was at least 5 years old. We ended up with a Britax Regent from the Kyle David Miller Foundation. <br>  <br>  To your question: kids should stay in a 5 point harness AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, at least until 4 years and 40lbs, but experts recommend until 5-6 years old. And then its time for a high back booster seat. They then need to use a booster until they meet ALL these:<br>  -at least 8 years old, at least 80lbs, at least 4'9" tall and pass this 5 step test:<br>  1. Does the child sit all the way back against the auto seat? <br>  2. Do the child's knees bend comfortably at the edge of the auto seat? <br>  3. Does the belt cross the shoulder between the neck and arm? <br>  4. Is the lap belt as low as possible, touching the thighs? <br>  5. Can the child stay seated like this for the whole trip? <br>  <br>  As ketchupqueen said - each step 'up' in car seats is a major step down in safety. Keep them rear facing as long as possible (until at least 2 years old) and then put them forward facing and keep them harnessed as long as possible (at least to 5 years) and then to a booster.<br>  <a href="http://www.car-seat.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.car-seat.org</a><br>  WHY KEEP THEM HARNESSED:<br>  Compare the following crash tests for your self and see the major difference a harness makes.<br>  Forward facing harness vs. booster: <a href="http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seiten/kisitest_2002/videos/test2002/frontcrash/recarostart.mpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seite...</a><br>  A lateral test (the third view in) of a harnessed seat: <a href="http://www.oeamtc.at/videobox/index.php?domain=oeamtc&videobox=Kindersitze_bis_18_kg_oder_4_Jahre&movie_kind=swf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oeamtc.at/videobox/index.php?...</a><br>  A deep winged high back booster like a Parkway: <a href="http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seiten/kisitest_2002/videos/test2002/seitencrash/concordliftpro.mpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seite...</a><br>  A shallow winged high back booster like the Turbobooster: <a href="http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seiten/kisitest_2002/videos/test2002/seitencrash/htsbesafe.mpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seite...</a><br>  And a no back booster: <a href="http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seiten/kisitest/videos/tests_2001/seitencrash/Baby_Sunny_touring_P3_vorne.mpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.oeamtc.at/netautor/html_seite...</a>|`|sxsx9sHNaa	It's by weight.  by two year old is formward facing.

muBb414baa	Well... before jumping to talk to your supervisor I would ask myself, what kind of a relationship do i have with this person?  Is this someone you could kind of explain your situation to and feel that they may be able to give you insight or do you think they'd feel it was inappropriate to address such personal matters at work. People can be funny that way.  Id say try to hold out a little longer and then (before you need to take off) ask if you can have a little chat.  Explain your dedication  and interest in the position and explain that you really need the position. I wouldnt get into all the details about the father but Im sure they know your pregnant. <br>  <br>  Remember.. go with your gut. Try to watch your supervisor for the next few days and try to monitor his or her body language and see how you feel.  Either way.. if you want a definitive answer, a conversation has to happen.  A closed mouth doesnt get fed so make sure you let them know you really want the position and that you are the BEST one for it.  Plus, theyd have to retrain a whole new person.. why go thru the trouble when your great at it? =]<br>  <br>  Good luck !!!!|`|4x8hiC1xaa	go talk 2 ur superviser<br>  it isnt fair<br>  c if u can do some work for home or come in a few hours during the day long enough 2 keep ur job|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	If you like your job that much and are in question about it, go to your supervisor and just ask. Explain your concerns to them, and remind them that they told you that they were going to hire you full time and the first of the year is here, so you need to know if your job is secure, and remind them how much you love your job and that you do not want to lose the position that you have. Don't sound desperate but be firm in letting them know how you feel, the part that sucks is that you were hired on by a temp agency, most times there is nothing you can do, but asking never hurts! GOOD LUCK!|`|OuXnOkZuaa	Yea be polite but go and ask. This happened to my cousin and I gave her the same advice. Its not fair for the employer to be stringing you along and for you not to have the job security of a full time permanent employee...Good Luck with your pregnancy.|`|MW3Br5V8aa	Bite the bullet and ask him whats going on.. ur not gna do urself or baby any favours by being worried by this.. :) <br>  good luck with the baby and fair play doing it on ur own :)
79eRDIbXaa	At the Moment its Wait Patiently - Not long to you will start feeling them flutters loads though and then they get harder! Hehe So Exciting!!!<br>  xXx|`|67QVKHQ3aa	i think you have to just wait, ive tried a few things to make my son move but he moves whenever he feels like it.|`|UT2tv5N3aa	just have to wait patiently sorry|`|758cDKEFaa	try drinking two glasses of water and lying down and after a while you may feel something.<br>  also lying down with a warm hot water bottle on your tummy usually makes the baby move<br>  or drinking a sweet hot drink like tea with sugar and the warm hot water bottle may to the trick.|`|e583cebee349ef9a997c192a1abad42aaa	This is very early to really feel baby move yet.<br>  Saturday could have been wind or a rumbly tummy.<br>  However if you can feel your baby move at this stage, a bath, drinking cold water, or lying down still on your side could help.|`|8mchLCQhaa	Your baby is moving you just can't feel it yet.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Flutters are only felt sporadically so you can't really make it happen again at the moment I am afraid!<br>  <br>  Just wait patiently, you will feel little hands, feet and elbows everywhere in a couple of months!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy.|`|xhOulzZ7aa	You may have to wait patiently, will only feel flutters for the next few weeks. I found that a really cold drink would make my little one move. Good luck and enjoy|`|c73QkZ2haa	Its still a little early too be feeling them move all the time. Give it a few weeks and they will be keeping you up at night. :D|`|jZvrYLpfaa	Wait patiantly I'm afraid!|`|WKqXE6X4aa	I didn't feel my son kick until I was 20 weeks pregnant, a few days before my scan if I remember rightly|`|VEEbzc4jaa	Wow ur lucky i only felt my first flutter at 20 weeks! So its happened earlier for you.<br>  <br>  Things happen more regulary for me at about 25 weeks
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	You can take tylenol, but if your chest hurts when you take a deep breath I would call your doctor. It may be more than a cold. Good Luck!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You can take Tylenol.|`|bTlhBX3daa	It sounds like you might have gotten an infection in your lungs from the cold. I had a cold early in my 2nd Trimester and I had strained so much already from being very sick that everytime I coughed, my ribs hurt so bad. <br>  <br>  You can take Sudafed, Robitussin, and cough drops per my Dr's list. The only thing I know of that you can take for the pain is Tylenol. You might also try warm baths and/or a humidifier. If you can get some of the congestion to loosen up, that should help.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and a speedy recovery.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	This sounds like some sort of respiratory infection, call your physician and make an appointment.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	go to the doctor's and get checked out, better safe than sorry.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	go to the doctor|`|46K4FtE0aa	Your safest bet would be to see your doctor, As it is painful to take a deep breath it could be a touch of pleurisy, which is painful, but you do need to get the doctor to check it out, don't take anything without consulting a professional, it is not worth the risk.

wiAVa1H5aa	If it doesn't mention spermicide on the box you can assume there is no spermicide.
C6oTOvOMaa	Yeah I would think that they would check u before 38 weeks but i guess every doctor is different...<br>  <br>  1. Im 38 weeks pregnant now and wont know how many cms until tomorrow at my appt. but i can tell u at my 36 week i was a fingertip and at my 37 weeks i was 2 cm's<br>  <br>  2. Each doctor has there own rule of thumb but the typical is if u are at least 4 cm's they will admit you..They go by cervical dilation and effacement as well as contractions at times to determine when the best time is but usually 4 cm's.<br>  <br>  3. With my 1st I was sore for 6 weeks because I had a big cut from my baby being 9.5 and had to have the stitches, with my second I was sore for 4 1/2 weeks, same thing cut and stitches from baby being 9.1 and my 3rd I was sore for about 1 1/2 weeks and healed completely, bleeding and all in 2 weeks, was able to resume sex at that point with no pain, had a slight tear, no stitches baby was 8.7lbs...<br>  <br>  Even though your doctor may say he/she will not induce u sometimes there mind changes..if u dont progress,or if it is convenient for them at the time then they will induce. I hate the pitocin but find it to be very helpful in aiding to get things going a little faster =o)<br>  hope i helped some...|`|xnhwmontaa	None tight as a drum. <br>  <br>  Not sure I was induced with my first the second was scheduled csection<br>  <br>  I wasn't sore down there I had a c section<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry I know I wasn't any help!|`|prqrQcd1aa	With my first child I was 2cm dialated, I had c sections at 38 weeks with the other two, and wasn't dialated at all!|`|e4aF8tdPaa	i wasn't dilated at all. when i went to see my doctor on my due date i was only 2 cm and didn't go past that.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I just went for my 37 week check.  Im officially 37 weeks tomorrow but why split hairs.  :)  I hear you, Im so freaking sore and uncomfortable the pressure is horrendous.  My doc mentioned that Im good to go now bc the baby is full term and when I get checked next week she may decide to do a sweep.  All depending on if I have any dilation.  I have been walking my butt off.  I don't want sex cause my bits are so damn sore but I may suck it up and go for it anyhow.  I want this baby to come soon!  I even am tempted to eat pineapple even though the heartburn is gonna kill me.  When I was 37 weeks with my son I felt great still.  This one is killing me.  I have to go to the bathroom all the time too.  Both ends are giving me issues if you catch my meaning.    <br>  <br>  I was sore for about a week after I had my son.  I was out a lot regardless of how sore I was and I think that helped me snap back faster.  I brought him home mon and was out at the mall wed.  It was the stitches that gave me the biggest trouble.  There was the one that pulled when I walked or moved.  Other than that I felt pretty good.  Just like I had done a really vigourous workout.|`|oHV95EFLaa	for both of my pregnancies i wasn't dilated at my 38 week appointment.<br>  i'm not sure how many cm you have to be dilated to be admitted. and my 1st pregnancy i was sore for about 7 or 8 weeks because i got stitches and the 2nd time i felt normal after about a week with not stitches|`|iwtetdBoaa	3 cm & 75 thined out-|`|90zcKChJaa	I believe that I was 3 cm dialated and 50% effaced. Hang in there! You only have a tiny bit left to go!!!|`|MW3Br5V8aa	I was 2 cms at 38 weeks.. and induced at 42 wks! not a nice thing to go tru is it!!my goodness as if its not bad enuff u have baby inside a woman wants to shove her hand in aswell!! anyway..<br>  <br>  as far as im aware its 3-6 cms depending on how low baby is and stuff like that.. <br>  <br>  i had only 4 stitches after birth and they were the only things that hurt, nothing else, u dont realise how much ur pelvis is affected by things until u have the stitches, even sneezing was an effort! lol... <br>  i feel ur uncomfortableness though its very bad isnt it!! but all worth it.. :)<br>  <br>  best of luck with the baby :) xxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|WokwBBGIaa	well every one is different and each doctor is different as well, i was 41 weeks when i was induced and i was 2 cm dialted when i was 39 weeks im not sure how many cm u have to be for them to admit you but im pretty sure its between 2-4 like i said before every dr. is differentand i was sore for about a week after but it took about 4 weeks for me to feel back to "normal" also this depends if you tear vaginally i did a bit i think i got about 7 stiches it wasnt to bad though mind you i was only in labour for 3 hours|`|nCKdkYSyaa	at my 38 weeks check-up I was 1 cm dialated (Barely) lol <br>  <br>  My doctor said they never induce earlier that 40 weeks unless you or your baby is having health issues, no matter how many cm or dialated, they wouldnt admit you in the hospital. They just said watch for signs of labor and call the doctors or ER.<br>  <br>  I agree about the inducing it was not bad at all, actually a breeze if you ask me! I was also induced at 39 weeks and 5 days but because of high blood pressure issues and signs of pre-eclampsia and thank goodness they did my daughter was 9 lbs and i would have died if she stayed in any longer LOL<br>  <br>  I was sore for the first 4 -6 weeks, I stopped bleeding and the pain when urinating part went away when my daughter was about 2 weeks but I still was very sore down their and hurt to the touch (I also had 3rd degree tearing though) <br>  <br>  Just my thoughts!|`|3E2EQH12aa	i had my 3rd baby at 38 weeks, actually. when i went to my visit the week before, i wasnt dialated at all. so i went to the zoo and walked my @$$ off (lol) and actually thought that my water was leaking, so i went in, and was dialated 3cm. had him 3 days later.. and it doesnt matter how many cm u are to be admitted, its whether ur in active labor or not. good luck!! the end is so hard.
2eoAqicdaa	Routine! i swear by it! <br>  Give your little one his dinner at about 6:00 then a bath at 6:30 the bed at 7:00 every night without fail and he'll soon be sleeping right through<br>  <br>  I've done that since my son was 5 weeks old (now 14 months) and he has slept right through ever since... okai it took a week to get used to but it really did work! :)<br>  <br>  Also try lavender baby bath in his bath <br>  Make sure he's nice and full at dinnertime, he's probally waking up hungry <br>  <br>  If he does wake in the night... wait 5 min's to go in his room then the next night wait 7 minutes etc <br>  I know at first you feel real bad about leaving him for 5 minutes before you go in... but as long as he is in no danger then it will be fine|`|1s3nddaYaa	my son doesn't sleep through the night either, and he will be 17 months soon. wish i knew what to do as well :)|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My son didn't sleep through until 26 months.  That was the night the last of his 2 year molars came in!  Teething in my mind, whether they are fussy about it or not, plays the biggest role in sleeping.  My daughter is almost 22 months old, and she does not sleep through yet, but she is still awaiting all 4 of her two year molars.  We recently got her down from getting up 3-6 times a night, to now she only gets up 1-2 times a night!  We are just waiting out her teeth.|`|zwO8h7ZFaa	My son (who is nine now) was the same way. When he was two and three he would come walking down the steps at Midnight, sometimes i struggled with him up til 2:00am. Finally i realized he wanted to be around us so i let him just sleep on the couch until i went to bed and he slept better in the noise of us talking, tv, etc. around age 4 he finally starting going to bed and staying in bed. It's tough, but you get through it. My daughter is opposite thank god : )|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	his day time naps will play a big part in whether he sleeps all night or not. you need to train him to sleep all night. you need to establish a schedule for his naps, at what time he naps, when to get him up and what time he goes to sleep in the evening. also try to keep anything with sugar away from him in the evenings. you will need to pay close attention to those days that he does sleep all night and try to keep him on that schedule.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	Two words: Sleep training. Google it.
E6T9DPT9aa	No it's not a "male thing". That's kind of sexist to say.    Your father still thinks of you as his little girl. You are growing up. Try to explain gently that he is becoming a bit controlling.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|AjFA8qIxaa	When i first started reading i thought he was just being overprotective but then i read on...He took you rmothers car away? WOW! Yeah, he is controlling. It sounds like he needs to feel powerful in an abusive way. I mean he punishes your mom where it affects her ( not being able to go to work) and he thinks he's entitled to do so cuz HE bought the car. In his eyes it's not her car, it's still his car and he's giving her a privilege. Wow. I would go so far as to say you guys need to leave!  I mean what, you have to be careful to NOT upset him because it will be punished?   That's bad. If i were you i would take your mom and go to a counselor, get some help on how to get out of this,,  If this is not an option, go to a counselor and ask for help on how to get him to see that he has a problem and on how to make him accept help.  I believe that will be very hard and only work if he really loves you guys and wants to work on it. If he only has a family so he has something to control ( sadly there are enough families like that out there) then you need to realise that you are in an abusive relationship and need to get out ( easier said then done hence the counselor)  I wish you the best , i hope you take this to heart.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Yes, he is controlling. You need to let your bank know you will pick up the letters yourself so that he doesnt get a hold of them, as well as close your door and establish that is normal behaviour and you think its abnormal not to do so.   If you are worried, speak to your school councillor.|`|iHjt2nWyaa	Sounds like a problem.|`|nt65AYPXaa	Find out what his father was like with him.  Ask your mom.  Your dad just sounds like he wants to protect you.  He may have trust issues.|`|W76VDFKCaa	Since you live with your parents, he has a right to know what you are doing online and he should do your FAFSA for you since his tax information is included.  Is his name on your banking stuff?  If so, then he has a right to control that.  If not, ask him for the opportunity to learn to deal with it on your own.  If he doesn't, then open another checking account.  He does sound a little controlling over your mother but since you are 18, you only have a few more years to deal with it.  Finish school and get a good paying job where you can take care of yourself and not live with your parents.|`|ZtuLKde8aa	You still live in his house? Then grow up and listen to him. He runs the show, not you.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	It's not a male thing, it's something that controlling, insecure guys say is a male thing. I would get my stuff and move out of town. Living on minimum wage away from that crap would give me a higher quality of life than having daddy support me and treat me like his dog.|`|2KvXpB6oaa	Yes its a man thing but tel him your 18 now and are an adult. So i advise you to never get married cuz its worse. No going to the swimming pool no hanging out with your single friends no going to the mall by your self all ways have someone watching you so they can go make a big lie Dam its just hard being married i advise you not to get married till you are35 or never do it. You only got one teen ge life live it and have fun. Im 18 and i got married at 16 nad my husband don't even let me go to college cuz theres guys around. he even got mad cuz i want my own car. he thinks im trying to get every thing so i can leave him. Not true but i have a little one and sometimes i need to take her out to the doctor and im all stuck at home with no car.
CdJtH0xdaa	I'm a nineteen-year-old father to an almost two-week old boy. There are so many things in my life that would be different if I were thirty as I write this. If I were thirty, I'd be SO much more financially stable. My wife and I would have our own house (right now I'm living in my mother's house), we'd be making twice as much money as we do now (since I'm working, while my wife takes online college classes). I'd be more responsible, and have a better understanding about raising a child, which, while not easy AT ALL, is the best thing that has ever happened to me.|`|AA11895162	First of all, by the time you are thirty, you should be done or almost done with your education.<br>  Secondly, you may be a few years into your career, thus making you better off financially.<br>  Thirdly, you should have all or most of your 'partying' days behind you.<br>  Fourthly, you have learned a few life lessons and will pick a partner who will be a better mother (or father) for your children.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|83t9G4gcaa	Your entire world view is different at 18 v. 30. The values and ideals you impart on your child at 30 have matured, and you're less involved with your own 'self' at 30.  Idealism is maturing into reality, and you become engaged with society at a different level.  Plus the obvious, less ethereal differences: earning capacity is higher; maturity opens more doors; you're more patient, stable, centered.|`|0NwZPBgQaa	a teen aged parent has had a little while to grow up, and  a middle aged parent has had years to grow up and obtain a stable job and life. teen aged mothers just dont have the responsibility, income, or stability to deal with a baby!!|`|c2YcBbXyaa	hopefully by the age of thirty you're financially able to take care of yourself and a child.........|`|F32uPjAraa	Well, the take home pay, the maturity, the drivers licence, owning your home, do you want me to go on?|`|qK31iYRRaa	-You still have to go to school<br>  -You're not married<br>  -You don't have your own house<br>  <br>  -It's just not right|`|IYacMZCGaa	at 30 you might be more stable and not have to live w/ your mommy and daddy while trying to play mommy or daddy|`|7WUvPI8maa	the difference with a teenage parent and an adult parent varies. teenagers are still growing and experiencing new things in their life. they do not have the wisdom an adult would have and they may not be responsible parents. teenagers are also most likely still attending school and this makes it very hard to take care of a child. they are also probably not financallly stable to support the raising of a child. the couple will most likely not be married at this age either. these are just some differences in the age of the parent.|`|SE2xiEupaa	In my opinion, experience and emotional maturity are the biggest differences.<br>  At such a young age, a teenager is still learning who they are. It is hard for a young person who is still unsure of themselves to handle the flood of emotions and trials that come with pregnancy, childbirth, and raising a child. Many teenagers excel, but the main differences are experience and emotional maturity.|`|ad99276137754d78c3e466f9cfade285aa	Huge difference. I was a teen parent and had another child in my late 20's am now 30. The biggest difference is that I had to go to school and work as well as take care of my baby. Now I have a steady job, am married and am more knowledgeable. I have a better relationship with my oldest (who I had as a teen) than most of my older friends have with their teens though.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	A teenager is still in the process of becoming an adult, whereas a 30 year old is an adult and has been for awhile.

6VbNJOtfaa	I would not tell them that I do not plan on coming back and I will tell you why- things may change.  While you probably won't be going back to that job, what if something happens?  You always need to keep your options open, for yourself and your family.  Also, they will be having a temp take your place while you are on leave and so many of those temps get hired on (I have seen this time and time again) so it is not like you are leaving them high and dry.  A woman at my work just decided to stay at home after going on leave (she originally planned on coming back after 2 weeks!) and I think that the company half expects it, no hard feelings.  Just keep your options open because you never know what may occur.  <br>  <br>  You did the right thing!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I wouldn't tell them because as a manager I know that legally they are not allowed to ask you that and they can also get out of paying you for the entire leave if you tell them. Technically they have to pay you for the entire time even if you don't return, but trust me, they can find ways to get out of it.|`|5Vh876cPaa	I'm in the same vote as you. Personally I wouldn't tell them anything. I will let them assume that you are coming back even if you are not. They are going to fill your position with a temp. That temp by the time you are suppose to come back would know the job inside and out so if you decide not to come back they will have someone to fill the position permanently.  As far as your employer topping your EI, well that is part of their benefits package. Regardless its you or someone other employee. That is what they had opted to provide as an incentive to retain their employees. <br>  <br>  So don't feel guilty, enjoy your MAT leave and hey when it's closer to the return date. Make a final decision then. Who knows you might want to go back in the long run.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	As a business Owner, I'd appreciate the honesty of the employee telling me that they weren't returning.<br>  I would say to any of my employees to just call me back up, and I will try and get them back working with us, if it doesn't work out.<br>  <br>  I couldn't lie. I had a few staff members try that over me, and it really annoyed me.|`|4gZYucHMaa	o my goodness!! That was me oh about 8 yrs ago. I was just starting a job when I found out I was actually 8 weeks pregnant ( i didn't know until well into a month into the job that I just started). I told them I was pregnant one month later at the 3 month mark (before I could get terminated when probation was up). They made my life hell the entire time I worked there, felt that I used them just for their benefits etc * as I said the baby was a surprise*. When I left, and had my child i knew I'd never go back to them. They kept pestering me to get in asap, not take the leave etc and I finally told them one month before I was to return I'm not coming back. IT was extraordinary ugly, my boss was livid. But I did what I felt right for my family and myself. I hated that job, hated how I was treated and I'd found out that if I did go back to that job, it wouldn't of been there after 8 months anyway*(because they closed up office due to lack of govt funds)--And they didn't tell me that! So I look at it as a karma thing, My heart told me not to go back even tho I was scared to give up the money, the benefits and be a full time mommy but now 7 years later I don't regret a thing.<br>  <br>  In regards to your situation, you don't owe them anything--if they were going to lay you off or something, do you think they'd give you courtesy? Probably not, do what's right and in your heart.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Read the small print. Some company's can ask for the return of benefits unless you come back for x amount of time.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	me personally.  i was in those shoes - i told them the truth.  i was very lucky and i was allowed to keep my vacation and health insurance through the 12 weeks that i had earned.  they didn't have to legally let me do that, but they did.  i felt it was best because i wanted them to have a replacement for me and this way i was able to train my replacement as well.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes, I would have told the truth. I would want to ensure I get a good reference from each job I leave.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	i was sort of in this situation, but i was with my company for 2 yrs and my boss and co-workers were awesome. it was the work itself i hated. my boss asked if i wanted to return and i honestly thought i wanted to. but as i got closer to my due date, i got more anxious about leaving dd somewhere. so i talked with my boss and she was understanding enough to extend my maternity leave by adding on my 2wks vacation and then allowing me to quit ~ and then advised me to file for unemployment! i went into labor the first day i was supposed to train  my replacement.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Hmmm, tough call.  If you tell them now, then you won't be getting paid while you're with your little one.<br>  <br>  I think that since you just started the job sort of, you should tell them... you almost don't "deserve" the pay while you're out... if you had been there forever and sort of earned yourself the benefits then I have to honestly say I wouldn't tell them until the last minute.  But I would feel guilty in this situation... I think you should tell them... after you save up a bit of money first!
yCwPxulYaa	I have a play mat that I put my daughter on because she would do the same thing.  Also I would put toys in front of her that she likes to keep her interested.      As soon as she rolls over, I usually put her back on her tummy a few times.      Thats great that he is already pushing up on all fours.  He will be crawling before long.  Time to start baby proofing!!!!|`|UYU1kapPaa	Get on the floor and play with him.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	He'll get it!  My daughter hated belly time and I didn't like to hear her cry so I hardly ever left her on her belly for more than 10 minutes.  She's 6 months old and even though she didn't have much belly time, she still shows the signs of almost crawling.  She lifts herself off the floor and definitely grabs things and pulls herself to them.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Plus, you son just learned a new skill!  He's probably going to do that until he learns something else and does that one endlessly.  My daughter would blow raspberries for weeks and then, out of the blue, when she started giggling, she stopped blowing them.  She just started up again, this time with her tongue!      I wouldn't worry though, sounds like your son is doing just fine!  Good luck with him!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u just play with him and roll him back over or put a blanket roll behind him so he can't roll; or in front of him; start trying to teach him to roll back....
6igjX2cnaa	Hey hun.  The dr. can do a transvaginal ultrasound and tell you how thick your endometrium (uterine) lining is.  Around ovulation, it should be between 8-12mm thick on screen.  For example, I have been going through fertility treatments and by midcycle my uterine lining was 10mm thick.  The uterine lining needs to be a certain thickness for implantation to take place.  The only way you would know is if your dr. does the ultrasound.  Best wishes*
w4zjmhxoaa	I think all veggies are equally as important, and it's good for babies to get a variety (of fruits and veggies).    I gave my son Nature's Best, or the organic line of Gerbers.      Once he was eating 3 meals per day, his meals looked like this:    rice cereal/fruit for breakfast  fruit and veggie for lunch  rice cereal/veggie for dinner    if you give too many veggies, and not enough fruit it can constipate them.  Too much fruit, not enough veggies can have an opposite effect.  So both are pretty important.    Good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279...  olids best    After six months, Mrs Rapley said babies were capable of taking food into their mouths and chewing it.    Therefore, feeding them pureed food at this time could delay the development of chewing skills.    Instead, she said, they should be given milk and solid pieces of food which they could chew.    Mrs Rapley argued that babies fed pureed food had little control over how much food they ate, thus rendering them vulnerable to constipation, and running a risk that they would react by becoming fussy eaters later in life.    She blamed the food industry for convincing parents that they should give children pureed food.    She said: "Sound scientific research and government advice now agree that there is no longer any window of a baby's development in which they need something more than milk and less than solids."
pCwIokI0aa	Having to pee alot is one of the usual early signs of pregnancy, part of all the hormonal changes your body goes through. <br>  <br>  Later on in your third trimester, your growing uterus shrinks your bladder's capacity just as you are producing more urine.<br>  <br>  So during the first trimester you have to go alot because of hormone changes and that doesnt affect you while you are sleeping but when you get further along and your uterus gets bigger, it will put pressure on your bladder during the day, during the night, pratically all of the time.  Then you will be making a dozen bathroom trips a night.|`|xoM9a7Uyaa	I didn't start using the bathroom frequently until I was about 32 weeks along, so at ten weeks I wouldn't be to concerned.<br>  <br>  Actually, I slept through the night pretty regularly for most of the pregnancy up until the past month or so (and I'm 36 weeks now).<br>  <br>  Just enjoy it while it lasts, it's most likely going to get worse!|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	it will happen. Don't worry about it too much unless of course you can't hold it...a few years ago I worked at a big box retailer and this lady who was pregnant couldn't hold it I felt so bad for her. just be sure if you have to go you find the nearest washroom ;)|`|46K4FtE0aa	I have had 3 babies but never had to get up in the night to go to the toilet, don't worry, every pregnancy affects every woman in different ways.|`|GHlYbDfJaa	It will happen when you get farther along. The bigger the baby gets, the more pressure he/she will put on your bladder and cause you to go more often.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	I wish I didnt have to. I drink a lot all day and am VERY thirsty at night so I wake up 3-4 times during the night. I also get up at night to get drinks though.|`|AA11661793	I am 16 weeks and just stopped having to get up to go during the night, but it was bad at first. It will get better for a little while then alot worse in the third trimester.|`|em8A42Bqaa	It depends, some nights you may have to go 100 times, some nights not at all.  Be thankful for the dull nights|`|A0NfgNEiaa	and ur worried because??????????????<br>  <br>  count urself lucky lol|`|GxYtTjUbaa	I'm ten weeks 6 days the same thing is happening to me.

Now I have to pee every 10 minutes it seems during the day and I'm up 4-5 times during the night...Just wait til the baby KICKS your bladder and you're like "oh my god, I have to pee, NOW"...It's fun.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	oh it will soon, trust me! ha ha. especially in your last trimester, good luck! i wake up like 4 to 5 times in one night, i am 9 months tho!|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	WOW!!!!

E6T9DPT9aa	It's not pregnancy.    You only ge severe back pain in pregnancy from the weight of a almost fully grown baby.    That's just PMS.    USE A FCUKING CONDOM!

If your period is late, do a pregnancy test.  If it's positive, you are pregnant. If it's negative you probably are not pregnant, but if you continue having symptoms or miss another period, go to Planned Parenthood for an exam.      And if you are NOT pregnant, take advantage of this scare to have a long, serious talk with your boyfriend about you decision to have sex at such an early age, and  -- if you opt to continue, you MUST find a more reliable method of birth control. (Planned Parenthood can help there too.)|`|hZWup7xXaa	you should try a home pregnancy test they cost around $15-$20. if it comes back negative and you still are having symptoms you should go to your doctor or even a walk in clinic. hope this helps and good luck hun and im glad to hear that you don't want an abortion :) if you wanna talk to someone about it you can im or email me on here.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	...

Id'e personally take a pregnancy test.

I am against abortions too. I am christian and I recommend you to pray, God is by your side, supporting you, but you know it was a bad decision to have sex. You're too young, but anyways, congratulations!!! hope your parents understand you. God bless you. =)|`|PBY9MNDFaa	......|`|hGY08GjRaa	Step 1: have your boyfriend or someone drive you to the pharmacy and get a home pregnancy test    Step 2. If that comes back positive, have someone take you to a free clinic and confirm the pregnancy.    Step 3. If you are in fact pregnant, tell your  parents. It's not like you'll be able to hide it. You'll probably be surprised how supportive they will be.     Step 4. Don't let ANYBODY talk you into doing something you don't want to do. DO NOT let them convince you to abort. You will seriously regret it. Probably also giving it up you will regret. Repeat: Do NOT let anyone (parents, b/f) convince you to do anything you do not want to do.     Step 5. Do NOT depend on Bf's support. He's still a kid.. MOST say they'll be there for you, but VERY few actually will. Seriously, take a poll of teen mothers or people who have been pregnant teens, and find out.     It will be a tough road ahead, but you'll make it, with or without boyfriend.|`|wG4hActyaa	i've read that periods can come like 3 or 4 weeks late if you are worrying alot or stressed alot. i don't wanna sound mean but 95% of the time, being that young, he will leave you eventually. younger people just get tired of the same person too easily. don't forget you haven't even been a teenager for a whole two years yet... you have your whole life ahead of you and i hope for the best.
1z3C0R2Vaa	congrats even if the line is light you are still pregnant but it is young.good luck................................|`|RPszYGXkaa	If you see a line, even a light one, it is positive!  Congrats and call the Dr!|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	If the line has color to it...then it's positive, and it does not matter how faint it is.    If the line is gray with no color to it...it is negative, and it's just an evap line.    My doctor says to wait for a week after my missed period to let my body build up hcg (which doubles every 2 or 3 days when pregnant).  This cuts down on false negatives and the line should be darker at that point due to more hcg in your urine.|`|Def3uk2aaa	a light line is still a line.  even the faintest means positive|`|4AO2myzKaa	If there are two lines, and the second (not control line) is light, then you are pregnant.  You can go to the doc to confirm, but may want to wait a day or two so your hormone levels will be higher.

GxYtTjUbaa	Yes I'm so emotional this pregnancy because I'm hoping they allow me to do a vbac many have told me I'm the perfect canidate for a vbac I have a six month old baby girl and am curently almsot three months pregnant with my baby #2 I want to have a vaginal delivery so bad. I don't want to expirience a c section again it was horrible for me I also have a horizontal cut there for I think that I am able to. I found a doctor and I'm going to see them on the 11th of march ill be thirteen weeks so I'm hoping I get good news what do you think? Will I be able to my last c section was due to my high blood pressure the doctor called it preaclampsia so I'm a lil worried I mean if all goes well this pregnancy and I carry full term can I deliver regulary? I hope so I'm on an emotinal roller coaster|`|d1csiCLKaa	I had a VBAC with my last pregnancy. My c section was due to the baby being breech for most of mt pregnancy.<br>  I am ttc#3 and am hoping that i will have another VBAC as everything went great with my last natural birth.<br>  My midwife told me that unless there is any complications then im sure you will get your VBAC.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|myEwHgI1aa	Yes, I am. I have been waiting for labor to start naturally to do a VBAC, but I am already 42 weeks now. I visit midwife tomorrow, and see what the plan is.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I'm kind of surprised they waited this long to tell you they would 'let you' try. Although with my last birth, I decided at around 37 weeks to do one and crammed as much information into my brain about them as I could. I had a successful VBAC after a prior c-section due to breech presentation. <br>  <br>  If you haven't already, I would do a TON of research and read as much as you can. Including talk to women who have positive stories about it and who can support you. The positive support meant the world to me and knowing that if other women could do it, so could I. <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	I would have her wait a few weeks and take a HPT. If she is stressed over this too, then that could be delaying her menstrual cycle. Good Luck!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Most of the time, pre ejaculate does not have sperm in it. The only way it would is if you had ejaculated in the past 24 hours. Pre ejaculate's main purpose is for lubricating the vagina for sex and to clean out any bacteria in the penis so that the sperm has a better chance of getting through to the vagina. But if you had ejculated in the past 24 hours, there can still be live sperm in the urethra (penis). Urinating after each ejaculation will help kill off any remaining sperm. So the not ejaculating inside of her plus the fact that you had sex the day before her period, makes the chances of her being pregnant low, but not impossible. (a woman can only get pregnant when she ovulates which is "normally" 2 weeks before her period. But we can ovulate at any time in our cycle) The only thing she can do it take a test. I would do that in a week or so. You should always use protection if you don't want to take the chance of becoming pregnant.<br>  <br>  That being said..... You asked if any of us have experienced the same thing. I have. My husband and I had 2-3 times (using the pull out method) on our anniversary. (hey the kids were gone, and we had a bit of jagermeister..lol) This was 2 days before my expected period date. We thought we were safe bc it was so close to my period. Well, surprise..I didn't get my period and 2 weeks later we had a positive blood test. I am now almost 36 weeks pregnant. So It very well can happen, even though it is rare.<br>  <br>  <br>  What Lucia said is true. If she is pregnant, I would say she was already pregnant when you had sex 2 days before her period.|`|46K4FtE0aa	You don't need to come to get a girl pregnant, all guys leak pre ejaculate4 when sexually excited,they can't feel or control it and  it contains sperm. All you can do is wait until she is 7 days late then take a test using the first urine she passes when she wakes up in the morning. If that is negative and she still doesn't get her period, then she will have to wait until she is 10 days late and ask the doctor to take a pregnancy blood test. Maybe you have learned a valuable lesson, no unprotected sex is safe. Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex and is not a form of birth control.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	If your question is 'could she be pregnant', the answer is yes (although surely she's just as responsible for acquiring the morning after pill as you are...?).<br>  <br>  If it's 'what do we do', get hold of a pregnancy test and for the love of crud use protection in future.|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	Lucia said it all. There is nothing out there that is 100% guarunteed! My daughter was on birthcontrol when she became pregnant, and so was my mother when she got pregnant with my younger sister.|`|kH56qw2Taa	she cant get pregnant the day before her period is due its about 2 wks b4.|`|muBb414baa	Baby... NO GLOVE NO LOVE lol<br>  <br>  Im joking, listen seriously... theres always a chance but if she was supposed to get her period the next day then its almost impossible she could have gotten pregnant. IN order to get pregnant there has to be an egg there and the egg is only there for 12-24 hours, about 2 weeks after her period. Did you have sex 2 to 2 1/2 weeks ago?  Thats what id be worried about if she still hasnt gotten her period.  Get a test if she is late n next time wrap it up honey. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Email: Endlesslove2469@yahoo.com|`|zBFZXSHoaa	all you can do is wait...a few more days and find out or she can just take a prgenacy test to solve the problem fast|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	precum hello and if she was supposed to get her period the next day she was preggo before you had sex.
b8f0CfSsaa	I am in the same position, 6 days late and no period but no BFP! I asked this a few days ago and I was told that some women simply don't pick up on a HPT as the HCG doesn't filter through their Kidneys to a high enough degree for it to work. Your best bet is to wait until after the weekend and then go request a blood test, thats my plan anyway!<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you get your BFP!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	It took three months with my first baby for the hormone to show in a urine test. have they done blood work? That was the only way I found out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS: It is also possible you ovulated a little later than normal and you are too early to tell in a urine test.|`|qdhM6O5jaa	I'm old so may be out of date but I remember some of the same symptoms also I understood that with pregnancy tests "Positive is always right but negative can be wrong" Good luck. I hope you are|`|xhOulzZ7aa	You seem to have all the right symptoms, go see the doctor and get the blood test done, only this will tell you for sure.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Have a blood test done at the docs. - some women do not secrete the pregnancy hormone into their urine, which could explain why you're getting negative tests.|`|AA11066099	Hi, wait another couple of weeks and try again.Good Luck.x
YzUPmWTBaa	Yes, my sis in law was very late and very sick, but hpts kept on saying negative. So I took her to the doc for a bloodtest, and she was 8wks pregnant! For some reason the hpts just didnt work for her. Go do a blood test asap, and let me know please?|`|AA12347868	I would say have a blood test; I hear a lot many women only get possitive with blood test!! :) wish you the best|`|1271d587c9b33791fba5249b9fc36ca0aa	with my daughter, I was 3 weeks late and still NOTHING!  so, I just made an appointment with an ob/gyn, had a test done there and it came out positive!  it can still happen for you!!!  best of luck!|`|weA0Xdszaa	Hi . It is possible that the HCG levels in your blood are too low to be detected by a urine test, so what I would suggest is to ask your doctor for a blood test which would be 100% sure. Personaly, I have no other symptoms in early pregnancy then fatigue (lots of it) ... <br>  For my first pregnancy I had to wait 7 days for a positive, but some women have to wait even longer...<br>  I wish you the best of luck ;) Baby dust!
kVIOtS5gaa	birth defects!|`|i8Ch743Laa	You can't really be addicted to paxil. It's not like a controlled substance. When the person was pregnant,she should have been weaned off of it,if she was in fact addicted. I know that I'm on prozac,and my OB and my psychiatrist are totally fine with it. The risks are sooooo rare anything happen. Yes,I've read and been told to especially avoid paxil.|`|UT2tv5N3aa	Recent research is casting doubts on the safety of the drugs most commonly prescribed for depression — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and some closely related drugs. SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and sertraline (Zoloft), among others. Three closely related drugs are duloxetine (Cymbalta), nefazodone (Serzone), and venlafaxine (Effexor).<br>  <br>  In response to this new research, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) now recommends that the decision to use SSRIs and related drugs in pregnancy should be made on an individual basis. In addition, ACOG recommends that women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should specifically avoid taking Paxil.<br>  <br>  That means you should avoid taking SSRIs during pregnancy unless you absolutely need to. If you're taking Paxil, you'll need to stop or switch to another medication before you conceive.<br>  <br>  Past studies found no significant difference in the rates of miscarriages and stillbirth between women who took SSRIs and women who didn't. An older class of drugs known as tricyclics, which includes amitriptyline (Elavil) and imipramine (Tofranil), has also been considered safe, as have newer drugs such as bupropion (Wellbutrin).<br>  <br>  However, the most recent research analysis, published in 2006, showed that SSRIs are associated with a small increase in the risk of miscarriage.<br>  <br>  Another analysis showed that babies whose mothers take SSRIs during pregnancy may be more likely to be born prematurely, have low birth weight, spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit, and have trouble adapting to life outside the womb. This was particularly the case for babies of women who were also taking other drugs for mental conditions or who smoked or drank alcohol.<br>  <br>  Recent studies have noted withdrawal symptoms in nearly a third of newborns whose mothers were treated with SSRIs near the end of their pregnancy. The most commonly reported symptoms included tremors, convulsions, irritability, and increased crying.<br>  <br>  These symptoms were relatively benign and short-lived, lasting only one to four days after birth. Some doctors recommend that their pregnant patients taper off to a lower dosage or stop taking antidepressants ten to 14 days before their due date to prevent withdrawal symptoms in their newborn.<br>  <br>  Finally, a small, well-designed study found that babies whose moms took SSRIs in the second half of pregnancy were six times more likely to be born with a rare but serious breathing problem. The disorder, called persistent pulmonary hypertension, was still uncommon among these babies — only about one percent developed it. More research will be needed to confirm these conclusions.<br>  <br>  As for Paxil, four studies published in the past two years found that the babies of women who took this drug in the first trimester had a greater risk of birth defects.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Antidepressants known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate), may cause birth defects and are not considered safe to use during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you're clinically depressed, it's important to get the treatment you need, whether it's psychotherapy or medication or both. Some new preliminary research suggests that when depression or anxiety goes untreated during pregnancy, it may be harmful to you and your baby, possibly raising your risk of preterm labor, premature delivery, and a lower-birthweight baby.<br>  <br>  Untreated depression during pregnancy can also continue after you deliver. Many studies have shown that if a mother is depressed after delivery, her child is more likely to have trouble with cognitive, social, and psychological development.<br>  <br>  If you're pregnant and having symptoms of depression, consult your healthcare provider and get a referral to a counselor or psychiatrist. These professionals can help you figure out what kind of care is best for you and whether you should be taking antidepressant medication.<br>  <br>  If you're already taking an antidepressant and you want to stop taking it while you're pregnant, be sure to consult your doctor on how best to do this. Quitting suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms, and you'll need to make sure that you continue to get the support you need.|`|e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	Pregnant women and those who might become pregnant should avoid taking the antidepressant Paxil because of a high risk of birth defects, mostly with the heart. It doubles the risk.|`|J1Frx83haa	sure
KNxs4PrZaa	we moved to a two story house when our daughter was just one and learning to walk.  i was worried at first but we all adjusted really well.  at first i had gates up, but she quickly learned how to do the steps with confidance.  i watched closely or held her hand in the beginning but now at 22 months she flies up and down them with no problems and has never fallen.  before you know it is wont be a second thought, you just need to be careful in at first getting her aquanted and put up a gate at the top until she is comfortable enough to do them alone.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I don't really have a two story house, but we have a finished basement and our family is down there all the time.  I too, was fearful of the stairs.  My son was barely a year old when we moved in.  But we've been cautious.  We kept a gate up in the doorway, even when the gate was closed.  We carpeted the stairs and installed a smaller railing under the normal one the adults used.  This way my son can hold the railing and my hand as we're going down the stairs.|`|6Kq1ExFxaa	Umm, in the UK every house is two story and gates do stop them falling. Nothing to worry about, just keep them in rooms when upstairs and let them out more to run around.|`|9tf9VF9naa	a single storey house is always better. <br>  why worry unnecessarily|`|nv8sVAhAaa	I don't have a double story house, but a friend of mine does. She actually wishes she lives in a single story house as it is so much easier for her personally (as she has a disability - limp when walking and one of her hands doesn't have full function ). <br>  <br>  Though I have stayed there on a few occasions with my 2 boys and I found it to be a pain in the bum going up and down the stairs just to do the littlest of things - Like bath the kids, take the baby upstairs to bed (her daughter is almost 3 now). Though after about 8 months or so she decided to get another set of chested draws as she got sick and tired of going up and down the stairs just to get change of clothes. So she keeps her daughters everyday clothes down stairs.<br>  <br>  My friend also has 2 gates - one at the top of the stairs and one at the bottom of the stairs.<br>  <br>  I hope this little bit of info has helped in what you are wanting to know. So good luck in purchasing a new home, though I do recommend if someone can look after your child while you are looking at houses as it gets pretty tiring looking at houses (that's if you are gonna look at one after the other - I mean 4 or 5 houses in a row)|`|Ux6tayynaa	<a href="http://infoanswers.digs.it" rel="nofollow">http://infoanswers.digs.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|jUxwbLTtaa	very safe|`|AA10152346	I have a two story house and 2 kids ages 4 and 2.

She has learned to climb up the stairs, but we never leave her on or near the stairs unattended.<br>  <br>  "Have you ever dealt with this problem?"  I't's NOT A PROBLEM!!!

It's not a scam, I've made real money off it.  However, before you bid on any jobs, check the history of the buyer.  If they post jobs but never select a bid, avoid them.  If they don't like to pay real rates, avoid them.  For example, my profile on e-lance is for freelance writing.  I charge $15 per article.  Some people only want to pay $1 per article.  However, there is lots of legitimate work on this site from honest people who are willing to pay.  Start off with a basic membership to see if it is for you. I only have a basic membership (limits me to 3 bids per month) but it works for me.  I also signed up on www.guru.com.  It's similar to e-lance but I get 10 bids per month with a basic membership.

You can contract with a local hospital and work from home, though you do need to take a class or two to get certified.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Babysitting at home is about it. No those online ones are scams, if they were real we would all stop going to work right? They charge you money after taking in all your personal info, the person you pay just made money and put you at risk. There are at home jobs, you get them by working at a company that starts up a position. My daughter went to college for medical ins billing, her company moved, and created a few at home posisitions. My other friend, took court reporting and from doing that work for quite some time, was refered to an office that has people transcribe at home. Thats about it, unless you own a company. Baby sitting pays pretty good.|`|P544Sbmqaa	The best thing for you to do, honestly, is watch some other kids during the day.  Either as a baby sitter, private nanny or even as a home day care.  I say this because...  you are a stay at home mom for a reason.  You could go find work outside the home, but you choose to stay home for a reason, which I presume is so that you can spend time with your son.  Do you honestly think any kind of job like that, even if you can work from home, is going to allow you to be with your kids??|`|Btsctjydaa	Get paid to be on Answers as a celebrity.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Go to cloud10corp.com and apply for a position. They will check to make sure you have the right specs on your computer, and then have you do a phone interview. Once you pass that interview, they will begin to send job opportunities your way through email. You can decide to apply for whichever jobs look like they'll work for your schedule.    The pay is around $8-9 an hour, you will absolutely have to have a computer with XP Operating System and a dedicated internet line to your computer. You will be required to purchase a USB headset if you get a job offer. You will need a completely QUIET place to work from. If the interviewers hear even a refrigerator hum in the background you will be automatically disqualified.     Most jobs consist of taking customer service calls for various companies. When I signed up, it took about 3 weeks before various positions started rolling in.

Let him watch soccer, let him play soccer outside when the weather is permitting.    As far as driving the neighbors nuts, have a new policy -- "Soccer balls are OUTSIDE TOYS ONLY."    Get him a soft, squishy soccer ball like the one pictured in the link I'm providing.  That can be his "indoor" soccer ball.  All other soccer balls are to be used outside only, because you can break things if you play with soccer balls inside.

Sounds like fun to me!<br>  Seriously, there is a reason kids have bedtimes! So they can get the rest they need in order to function better the next day at school or home or whatever. Not to mention it makes life much easier for the parent. A tired child is cranky, whiny and more defiant. And if they don't get enough sleep at night then they are monsters to deal with the next morning and usually cranky the next day. <br>  So, that mom was being a responsible parent and have most likely already learned the consequences of keeping their child up past their bed time.

I have a 6 year old and a 11 month old.  I run errands, go visit with friends, out to lunch and/or dinner, etc. <br>  <br>  About the example you use...the 8 year old could easily have laid down in someone's bed or on the couch.  When I'm at a friend's house with my kids and it's bed time or i see they are tired, I just ask the friend to let them lay down to sleep somewhere until I'm ready to go.

I did notice a couple of moms who had not and it just doesnt look right and have gotten a few strange looks from other parents in the group.|`|1Crt9jQXaa	being pale is one thing<br>  but pale HAIRY legs is another. shave!!<br>  plus i wouldnt worry about being white, it is winter and not many people have a good tan right now. but neutrogena has a really good natural looking spray on tan. i use it and love it.<br>  but yes, shaving is a must.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	its not necessary, however if you dont do it youll probably just feel more self conscious... your daughter doesnt care but you do. <br>  <br>  if your worried about body weight, and body hair, and a slippy baby in a swimsuit it may all just be too much!!! <br>  <br>  have a nice swim-date! it sound sso fun!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I am currently getting the courage to wax. You can come around if you want, I'll crack a bottle of Wine open.|`|3fe05dbb27a9cf0081ff4ef9a1434e1faa	Thanks for the morning laugh I had the same debate when swimming lesson time came up, I did choose to shave for the first week...Now my husband takes the little one...Ha ha|`|FvYqKZSMaa	To shave.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	No.  A little bit of hair will keep your legs warm.|`|miRzeIGeaa	Oh, for God's sake, just shave, will you.  It can't be too much to do it for your self esteem, you've just had a baby, still a tad overweight and self-conscious, don't make it any worse and shave your legs.  You won't look any better with hairy legs like a gorilla......|`|VKgD1K3baa	Oh goodness dear, LOL, shave your legs! My legs are sooo pasty as well, but they aren't going to get any darker hiding behind pants, or hair for that matter. Plus, wouldn't you feel more uncomfortable with hairy legs out in the open instead of just white ones?|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Haha, I get your dilemma. Since having my second child, I save shaving for "special occasions." But if I were you I'd shave and use some instant tanning lotion (waterproof so it doesn't turn the pool orange), just for fun.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	LOL...<br>  <br>  How long has it been since you have shaved? Not to be rude in anyway, but its really proper Hygeine to keep your legs shaved. Or, in America it is. I would shave if I were you. People are harsh these days.|`|IKWAUkNkaa	I am a man and can only provide a male perspective.<br>  <br>  End of day, it is up to you, as long as you are comfortable with yourself, hair or no hair, it simply does not matter!|`|6IH8BhUSaa	lol heck i had baby 3 weeks ago and  i quit shaving my legs 2 weeks b4 i had the baby cuz i could barely bend down .. my hubby doesnt mind and  its inter insolation for me lol|`|weA0Xdszaa	LOL ... If you're not shy about it, do as you feel. I know I wouldn't dare!<br>  :P|`|aJjV5b95aa	I would shave.|`|62cQv3z3aa	you might want to do that|`|BFNGx3DOaa	shave dont be a dirtbag|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Don't shave.  That water is COLD.  The fur will help you keep your legs warm.
3HSNFDaJaa	I'm losing more as time goes on! So far I have gone home from work on the train forgetting that I'd driven to work, twice withdrawn money from cash machines and left the money in them (luckily the 1st time the machine sucked it back in and the 2nd time was in the village shop where I live and the assistant found it after I'd gone and kept it until I went in the next day), left my purse in the toilets at my cousins 21st birthday party (on this occasion my money was stolen). Thankfully only 12 more weeks to go before any more disasters!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Definitely! I'm right there with you! I left home without my purse last week. I never go anywhere without it and just walked out the door, me and my husband got to where we were going and I went to get out of the car and realized I didn't have it. We went out to dinner and I paid with my credit card, the waitress brought back the card with all the slips to sign and I signed the top one and we left. Never lifted up any of the other slips to get my card and I didn't realize it for a couple days and I had to go back and ask if they had it. Luckily they did! I don't do drugs, but I'm pretty sure that pregnancy amnesia is what it's like to be high! Your head is in the clouds all the time!|`|IwaTzQqxaa	in the beginning i thought this whole baby brain thing was a myth.. but then i started doing things like putting my cell phone in the refrigerator.. wondering where my sunglasses were when i was wearing them.. running around the house yelling at my husband asking where my keys were as i was waving them around at him while yelling about it.. <br>  <br>  it just gets worse.. at work if i go up front and someone asks me to email them something.. the 15 step walk back to my office makes me forget.. i fight people on things i think i have done.. but then when i finally check.. i completely forgot to do it.. ive become a post it not queen lol.. they're everywhere.. also.. i still havent found my cell phone clip.. i "lost" that 4 months ago.. ugh lol|`|dbafItLvaa	I had lots of moments like that! I called it "baby brain".  I felt like I could not remember anything.  My husband even noticed and looked it up online.  It's typical during pregnancy.  I think I'm getting better, but still I make sure I write down everything in case I don't know where I'm supposed to be in five minutes.|`|IWinNj2saa	I'm 29 wks 4 days, and still haven't found my marbles. Stopped the washer the other day, so the hubby could take a shower, it was full of water, white clothes, and BLEACH....forgot to start the washer back up...and drove away. I couldn't believe I had done it. Good thing we only got a few miles down the road, to be able to turn around and start the washer again. Placenta brain kills me! LoL|`|z0XRuVwSaa	i just hope our marbles return after baby is born because i can sit and stare at my pc screen and don't know wot to say to ppl on ere . <br>  i look in freezer to make dinner/ supper and ain't got a clue wot to make i just stare in this big white box with food in it lol|`|kUCVLuTPaa	i didnt but then again..all woman are different|`|kVIOtS5gaa	no.|`|nwWBddEnaa	lol keys in the fridge, keys left on the outside of the door, mobile.........somewhere haven't seen it in days, glasses on top of head and spending hours looking for them, when does this wear off?? lol|`|zdWDkadraa	I'm regularily one of those people who walks around a room 5 times zoned out then suddenly remember I was going to do the laundry and DASH for the basket. It's so annoying. <br>  <br>  Imagine me now.... =O You are not alone lol|`|D33VRTz8aa	no i didn't feel that <br>  but I kept thinking stupid things.<br>  <br>  e.g when i go for my scan what if they sy you don't have baby inside you. You are not pregnant. and so on. stupid things<br>  <br>  I am 27 weeks and one day ! :)|`|ssDPdqZaaa	yah, why is that?<br>  is it because im always thinking of the baby,, or is it hormonal?|`|46K4FtE0aa	Yes i was like that with all 3 pregnancies.|`|FA1rRzUxaa	yeah i found out i was pregnant on Saturday and think my brain has turned against me, lol|`|d304540c53bb1ee7a9ad670a4d0574e8aa	hard to tell, I can be like that on any given day :)|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I am 26 weeks and My marbles are still missing :(  I feel scatter brained and have lots of mood swings... :)  Last night I was talking to my mom on my cell and I got home and started freaking cause I couldn't find it!  and I was like damn!  I am talking on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ad0F70IMaa	yeah, my mind has been a bit off. it happens to most of us.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yes, i put butter in my tea one morning instead of milk, i was still half asleep though, but i for got so much, i would start to talk, then my mind would suddenly go blank, it was scary at times, im almost 16 weeks now and i think im doing much better lol|`|ZNTLSCLhaa	Yep!!  I'm there right now!  I don't know where my mind is half the time!  lol  I can't tell you how many u-turns I've made because I've forgotten something that I remembered just 2 seconds ago!  Does this last throughout the whole pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Plus, talk about an emotional roller coaster!  Wow!  What a ride.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	Early pregnancy I was working at a fast food place, and I kept forgetting the orders . It would make me sooo mad. I know what your talking about though.|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Yes I was like that. It was hard to focus on things. Good Luck!
QjgxH7Ouaa	LOL.  Toddlers are so funny!  Mine does the same thing.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I actually remember saying that myself as a child (although I think I must have been a bit older than your son is!)  Of course he's tired, but sleep is boring, he doesn't want to miss out on the interesting things, like play.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I think it's all toddlers.  My son will be 3 next month and lately when I tell him it's time to go to bed he sticks out his arms (in a very dramatic fashion) and protests "No, mommy, I wake up!".  I think the biggest key though, is to try to get them to bed before they get over tired.  When my son is whining and crying about every little things, he's over tired.  And by then, putting him down is almost impossible.  We found a great bedtime for him (and every child is different, so they need different time and different amounts of sleep) and we stick to it.  Once we figured out his best time to go to sleep, going to bed became much easier.|`|08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	Lots of kids do that, I think they're just too interested in what's going on around them to go to sleep! Come to think of it, I STILL do this, and I'm an adult!<br>  <br>  I think the best way to get them to go to sleep is to make it part of a fun but relaxing routine, so things like cuddling up with them to read a story and sing them a lullaby work wonders to get them in the right mood for going to sleep. You can even try not telling them that they are going to bed, just say something like, "hey, why don't we get your pajamas on and go and read a story in your room?", that way they don't feel the resistance of not wanting to go to sleep. I still do something similar with my older kids when I want them to go to bed earlier than usual.|`|a9btWYKRaa	HA HA My 3 year old is exactly the same. We were out driving once and I turned to her and asked her if she was tired and wanted to go to sleep, She said no of course. I turned round less than a minute later and she was fast asleep in her car seat!!  They just don't want to miss out on anything and they just wanna take everything in and learn new things.<br>  <br>  I explain to my daughter now when she protests that if she goes for a little sleep she will have loads of energy to play when she wakes up! Works eevery time<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|huWSAcT4aa	They pretend they aren'ttired because they don't want yo go to ebd and miss out on something.|`|IHZOoe9qaa	as a father who has a 3 yr.son i think they're just afraid that they will miss something while they are asleep, then again maybe they think SPONGEBOB is gonna get them LOL|`|8Wkt6mDBaa	Find something that he enjoys doing e.g bedtime stories singing along to a music c.d (just make sure its nothing that will get him worked up). Start doing this with him just before he goes to sleep and only do it at that time. Explain to him if he wont go to sleep than you cant do this thing first. He will soon give in.
PxawVQ7Xaa	It's thing like that, that cause mental  problems in later life, I wonder if your parents would be ok with the government putting cctv in every room of their house after all "There's nothing to hide, so why not?".<br>  <br>  If possible buy a laptop or ask people to put money together at christmas and they all buy you a laptop, then it's yours so you can take it to your room. It's impossible to talk sense into people like that<br>  <br>  When they do something that requires personal space keep barging in on them, so they can see how annoying it is.|`|zhJOZhKEaa	Computers are tempting.  No matter how good a kid you are there are too many *bad* things that beg to be peeked at just this once... things that can pull you in.  There are things that *I* at nearly 40yrs old don't do because my computer is in a public area of the house that I might try if it were not.<br>  <br>  Your parents are smart people.  They are protecting you from yourself and from the folks out there that might harm you by keeping that box in a nice public area.  As with so many parenting areas... be prepared to thank them someday.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	it's their rule. i have the computer in an open area as well. my nephew on the other hand has his own laptop he can use anywhere. i personally don't agree - there is too much stuff out there to be worried about for a parent. the computer isn't a necessity, believe it or not. go do something else. you can have privacy when you have your own place.|`|AA10998151	Get them to have Net Nanny put on the computer - thn they won't worry and  then you can pretend you have an au pair :)|`|1s3nddaYaa	maybe they figure thats where its supposed to be? i think its weird, maybe they are just making sure your not doing anything wrong. talk to them about it|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	my parents did the same thing, just in the kitchen/dining room. it's a parent thing.
Sqve8S42aa	Haha oh ive been through that, at first ignore her and pretend that you dont care and that it doesnt annoy you in any way. if she continues then you should face her with the problem and confront her about it. if she still continues maybe you should talk to a teacher about it and they could talk to her about it as well. Hmm Maybe she just wants to be your friend... but you have to make it clear to her that if she wants to be your friend, she cant just walk around talking **** about you, and seriously she needs to get a life. <br>  <br>  Good luck mate ;) xo|`|FERfSYtzaa	well do on to others what you wouold want them to do to you, just go up to her face and tell her thank you for takin your time to admire me and observe me and every way. i love how you tell everyone my life story and i hope you continue cause you makin me look good and yourself bad cuz you look like you have no life:)  <br>  <br>  (trust me you'll make her feel hurt)|`|vlKnBlYIaa	She's just trying to sound important and attract attention. Just ignore her and tell your friends too as well. If she's not getting the attention she'll soon stop being a pain and might turn out to be a nice person.|`|rVPrhd26aa	tell everyone she's a snitching narc stoolie rat because she is|`|JMBT0LSUaa	I think she just wants to get in your pants...|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	if she cares it means she is caring for you|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Just ignore it.|`|7SCjPftKaa	Because she doesn't have anything else interesting to say, or perhaps she thinks that she's your best friend when she isn't in the weird way that some people do.<br>  Maybe you're being paranoid and she's just a gossip who talks about everyone but you only notice when she talks about you. <br>  <br>  If you don't like it, try telling her in a non-confrontational way. I don't see why it should have to turn into an argument- just ask her nicely to stop talking about you because it makes you uncomfortable. How else do you expect it to stop?|`|dzyJw0cvaa	ignore her.  she obviously has insecurities and self esteem issues.  She is being immature and ignorant.  you will be the better person if you can go about your life without giving her the pleasure of making you feel uncomfortable.  Thats all she is trying to do, make you feel lower so she can feel better aboutherself.  its sad really..she is empty inside and someday hopefully she will figure it out and grow up.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VALxlwYSaa	Just don't worry about her. <br>  I have a girl in one of my classes that is just like that. She fears that you're better than her so  she finds small things to pick on you for. Even when she has no idea what's going on. <br>  <br>  Next time she says something accuse her of being a stalker. Kids wont like her much for that :P|`|p3d3E75oaa	maybe she is jealous and wants to be you, next time I would tell her how flattered you are that you make such an impact in her life that she cant find nothing else to comment on and walk away and call her a loser|`|hswTS1jVaa	Maybe she likes you and wants to be your friend.
5rqVTOzmaa	I love Luca Alexander for a boy, and I think Sophia Rebecca  or  Liliana Rebecca sound nice.|`|m5ViQJPeaa	I prefer not to go with the name Allegra~ it means something you don't want to know.

It's always been my advice to take a few names to the hospital with you and go from there.<br>  <br>  I would however, avoid naming a kid Allegra if you live in the States as that's the name of an allergy drug.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Boy: Matthew. such a great classic name that you just can't go wrong with. Matthew Luca and Matthew Alexander both sound great!<br>  <br>  Girl:<br>  I love Allegra!!! (but it might sound weird with Rebecca since they both end in the same sound) How about Allegra Kate?

KQU5y20waa	first off....they say it is worse to stop cold turkey when you are already pregnant.....for it causes to much stress on the baby....<br>  below is a question that was asked....i answered....and got best answer....so i thought that i would copy and paste and send it your way....hope it helps.....<br>  <br>  <br>  How many of you smoked during your pregnancy? Be Honest..?<br>  Did you at least try to quit or cut back on the amount you smoked? How are your children today? How did your pregnancy go and did it cause any complications?<br>  I know a lot of pregnant women who smoke and ones that smoked during there pregnancy..but you always hear the horror stories of smoking...just want to know how it effected you and your baby...<br>  1 day ago <br>  Additional Details<br>  I am 8 and a half weeks pregnant and finding it very hard to quit but i have cut back...i would like to quit by the time i am 3 months but if i can't want to know how everyones pregnancy went..i know thumbs down to me for smoking<br>  <br>  <br>  Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  blah blah blah blah blah....... i smoke......and i have during ALL of my pregnancies. is it the best choice......no. BUT.....look at all the other things that are not good either.....we could smoke dope,,,,,smoke crack....what ever.....but we don't. we could be alcoholics. but we are not. everyone of my children are healthy. never had any complications. they say it promotes low birth weight.....my babies got bigger....6 8...<br>  6 13.......7 14...... don't get me wrong....i am not saying its a great idea to smoke.....but at least u try and have slowed down....i give you thumbs up for trying......my mother smoked with 4.....my oldest sister smoked with 3. and my best friend smoked with 6 of hers. ALL HEALTHY! lol...=) the kids father is in the marines....and has never smoked or done ant drugs......and he is so against it.....and gives me **** in every way that you could think.... but i told him.....you met me when i smoked....you fell in love with me when i smoked....lol.....i tried several years ago to tell him that i don't inhale....but he told me that i was talking to bill clinton to much. lol.... god knows that we try....and he understands? that is why he takes care of things. idk...maybe this sounds stupid....idk...but don't listen to the **** that people give you.....you are not the first,,,and you sure hell wont be the last.<br>  <br>  <br>   Asker's Comment: Thanks...it was nice to hear some good stories instead of all the horror ones! You make some good points and i know your not encouraging smoking but just trying to give some facts about your experiences and that is greatly appreciated.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	Get the patch. It is very unsafe to smoke when you are pregnant.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	You should contact your local NHS stop smoking service or maybe take a close look at the pictures on your cigarette packets that illustrate what happens when you smoke and imagine that happening to your baby. I don't know how you expect people not to be mad, I know your intentions are good but a lot of women out there wait for years to get pregnant and then spend 9 months worrying and wrap themselves up in cotton wool. It can be very hurtful to read about someone carelessly smoking, for most women the natural maternal instinct would lead to them not smoking anyway.<br>  <br>  Well done for seeking advice though.<br>  <br>  Edit: There is no such thing as withdrawal symptoms for the baby, you are addicted not the unborn child.|`|ocD7VFtWaa	just think about the effect it will have on your baby. <br>  i'm not even talking about possible deformities.<br>  I mean you could well be giving your kid a nervous, addictive personality for life with anxiety and stress disorders, simply from the nicotine. <br>  you have absolutely no right to ever tell your kid to not smoke or do drugs or anything damaging to their health as you, an adult and the one person in the world who has the responsibility to give them the best chance in life, is choosing a bad habit for yourself and forcing it on your foetus which isn't able to cope with the same poisons your adult body can.<br>  You're forcing your kid to do something it has no choice in and it's not right. Smoking is an addiction, I agree. I smoke. And know it's ridiculously hard to quit. But the nicotine addiction is a cop out excuse because the main thing is, I can't quit because I don't really want to quit. I like smoking. If you don't like smoking, you won't smoke. <br>  So picture what you're doing every time you smoke. Let yourself imagine what it does to your baby and how you should be protecting it, not poisoning it. I'm not trying to lecture, but the only way to quit is to realise it's not for you, it's for your baby. As a mother your reason to live is your children. You should be willing to give your life for them, and you probably would be if it came down to it. So why not give up a bad habit? It's much easier to jump in front of them to protect them from a car or something than to give up smoking, because giving up smoking is something you have to repeat every time you want a ***. But it's really, really worth it.|`|T1Si1yvlaa	Pregnant and smoking.<br>  <br>  You know this is bad. By you doing this your child that is not born yet will be addicted to cigarettes as much as you are.<br>  <br>  By you being pregnant and smoking. It tells other people that you aren't a good mother and you don't love your child to do anything for them, which means not smoking. I am not saying you are, but this is the general impression people get out in public.<br>  <br>  You need to stop. Don't buy cigarettes, everytime you go to buy it think of that money you will need to buy diapers. Every time you go out to buy cigarettes, buy a bottle or a package of diapers instead. Keep your mind busy by drawing, knitting footies, or out taking a walk. Do what you need to do to STOP this nasty habit which will affect your childs whole life.<br>  <br>  I hope i helped and good luck, it must be difficult.|`|B1jZars7aa	my sympathy goes to you. I have had three children, all perfectly healthy, perfectly formed, and born at very large weights.by the way the youngest is 31 yrs now, but I smoked all the way through each pregnancy and had a lager or two now and again. Yes I felt sort of bad about it, but I just could not stop smoking, whatever you decide to do good luck sweatheart. We know deep down that smoking is bad for anyone, but its very hard to even think about stopping, never mind actually doing it.Once again, good luck and healthyness to all you children.|`|AA11103493	So annoying that most of those above me have only berated you for smoking when you're obviously already trying to do the right thing.<br>  <br>  I know how hard it is to stop.  Speak to your doctor for advice, or try the NHS stop smoking service, that way you will have constant support, and it's always easier to stop if you know that you're being checked up on regularly or you have someone to stop with.<br>  <br>  The NHS even have a "Pregnancy Smoking Helpline" 0800 169 9 169<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zBz10IiOaa	hello my dear i am 6 months as i smoked with my son,and he did have a heart problem but NOT! due to smoking he inherited it from me because i had a heart problem when i was born.anyway i do this i do smoke not a lot but i put them in my car to keeo em far from me and when i want one bad enough i will go get one most the time i am to lazy to get up and get one so there for i might have 4 a day i'll get shot down for this but hey i,m telling the truth and you can just put them some were far from you it helps|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	Hiya Kay, <br>  <br>  I have emailed you with some advice. Don't want to say what I have to say on here, like you said some women on here sure know how to make a girl feel good!<br>  <br>  At least she is trying guys! Kudos for that!<br>  <br>  The people who are having a dig are the ones who aren't addicted to nicotine like we are. Imagine trying to tell a heroin addict that they can't have a fix. Nicotine is a DRUG - an addictive one at that, it takes time and effort to overcome an addiction and support, so if you cant offer support you shouldn't be answering this question in a negative manner as this will stress her out even more, which you've guessed it! Will result in her having a ***! So, you may think you are 'helping' her and her baby by having a go, but really your not.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  X<br>  <br>  EDIT: Kay - I have tried to email you again, for some reason my emails are really weird, sometime sit will let me other times it wont. I'll just copy and paste what I was trying to say here, who cares what people think eh?<br>  <br>  Hiya Kay, I didn't want to answer your question on smoking publicly becuase you know what some people are like on here. <br>  First off, I will be in the same position as you soon. I have just had my first baby and smoked through out the whole pregnancy, sometimes up to 15 a day which I felt horrendous about, but the more I stressed about wanting to give up the more I smoked! My baby is perfectly healthy and weighed a good weight, but next time I have a baby I would like to try and give up.<br>  My partner gave up smoking 3 years ago, he used to smoke up to 80 a day and quit by reading Alan Carrs 'The only way to stop smoking permanetly' He swears by it and is constantly trying to get me to read it. I know a few people who have managed to quit using this book. <br>  Some people like me and maybe you just find it hard with will power and it's all very well and good saying 'think of your baby', but when you get that craving it is so hard!<br>  I would also look into hypnosis, my step mum tried this and hasn't smoked for 5 years!<br>  Hopefully you will get some good answers from your forum, but I fear you will get more abuse then some good solid advice. You'd think some of the people on here did no wrong the way they harp on! haha :-)<br>  Good Luck with quitting!<br>  XXX|`|Y4EEgkCraa	Hi sweet <br>  from what I read your will power is there!! The same thing happened to me with my first but I managed to stop by starting to cut my ciggies to 5 a day, then I used to cut them in half , and smoke half a ciggy. Then I cut back on those too till I finally manged to stop!!<br>  Unfortunately not all of us are the same and we all need different periods of time to cut down a habit but as long as you think STOP!!! STOP!!! STOP!!!! eventually you will!! This is my second time pregnant and I m trying to stop again by using the same technic so you see you are not alone!! This time its a bit harder but I believe in my will power and the love I have for my baby so I try my best same way I think you will too!!!!<br>   Good luck and keep me posted!! Take care xx|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Talk to your doctor, he or she can help a great deal. I smoked from when i was 15 years old till i was 19 years old and i mean chain smoked and stopped when i found out i was pregnant. You can do it just believe in yourself okay. Just think of the little life inside of you and you will know it is all worth it.|`|fNgv2FeRaa	I do sympathise with you! I used to smoke but I quit 3 years ago after smelling smoke on my daughters hair while she was sleeping.<br>  <br>  I never smoked again and quit on willpower alone..it's strange but I'd tried to quit before but never did.<br>  <br>  This time it was different and it was easy..I'm not going to lie and say it was hell because it just wasn't.<br>  <br>  Smelling the smoke on my daughters hair did it for me..if I could smell it on the outside what was I doing to her insides!|`|1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	I am 13 weeks and I smoke 2-3 a day. Going from a pack a day to as little as none a day was hard but it is still a clutch. Being pregnant is hard enough we are supposed to simply quit without the help of gums or patches because they are not safe for our unborn children. Cut down gradually is my only advice|`|AA11977483	It is hard to stop i have also smoked many years ago,there is lots of help now to help you stop also think about the baby you are carrying and how this baby will benefit from you not smoking thats what i did,it not going to be easy but you will do it,all the best hun.x|`|gdnL63ngaa	Cut back by 1 or 2 a day. Replace the ciggy craving with a small bowl of fruit and berries.<br>  Graduall will help|`|ukSHj5Yxaa	try the inhalator thingy Absolutely great feels like your having a ***, but not, really worked for me they are free too!|`|4gjPQFBDaa	My friend has just found out she's pregnant and asked the doctor about smoking during her pregnancy. He said she had to cut down and smoke 3 smooth or light cigarette's a day at the most. This was a big drop for her as she was smoking 20 a day before but she's managed it. Saying that my sister in law smoked about 15 a day all the way through her pregnancy and her daughter is fine - she's 2 soon! By the sounds of it your a bit like me ... fed up of smoking and want to quit (I'm guessing from the way your question reads)! I suggest talking to your doctor about this - he/she can recommend what is best for you and the baby in regards to giving up.|`|p419TVeVaa	Hi there I am not here to lecture you by any means... trust me I know how hard it is to quit smoking. When I quit smoking when I was pregnant with my daughter a couple of my fall backs were brushing my teeth and eating baby carrots and pretzel sticks, its the hand to mouth action that was hardest for me to break. Also remember that a craving will likely pass in 10 to 15 minutes its just trying to find something to occupy your time within those 15 minutes until the craving subsides. I wish you all the luck in the world with quitting!|`|ZJUyEOX8aa	Hey!<br>  I know how hard it is to quit. I'm pregnant right now and trying sooo hard to quit but it's hard. I try to think of my baby each time I light up and it has helped me to cut back ALOT. I was smoking over a pack a day when I got pregnant and now I'm down to about 7 or 8 a day. There is a number you can call that makes it alot easier to quit. They get it set up with you to have a quit date and coach you through it. Now that I've cut back that is what I'm planning on doing. Just remember....you can't quit smoking if you don't want to. You have to really want it for the health of your baby. It can't make the decisions, you can. So if you decide you are really ready adn serious about quitting smoking you should call 1-800-quit-now. Here is the link for the website.... <a href="http://1800quitnow.cancer.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://1800quitnow.cancer.gov/</a>     I hope this works for you, I know how hard it is and how bad itmakes you feel thinking you have to quit but don't know how. Good luck sweetie :)|`|c2kopbo6aa	i wanted to quit as soon as i found out but it wasn't that easy....i did soon after....I just kept thinking about him inside there....crying because i was hurting him...i made myself feel guilty and it worked....its all about habit...instead of smoking right after i ate i would skip it and gradually cut down...i also used candy- gum and suckers worked best for me|`|vue9NOhYaa	Talk to your doctor.  Many hospitals and OB practices have cessation programs, some specifically for pregnant women.|`|VVk0hHgpaa	I have asthma because my mom smoked when she was pregnant with me...<br>  <br>  i'm not going to shout at you of course not, but you are being 100% selfish here and you know what you should do for the health of your unborn baby...<br>  <br>  see a doctor and they can help you..  i dislike seeing big bellies with wide open mouths with cigerattes in them.<br>  <br>  * I get sick very easily because asthma not only affects the lungs but it affects the immune system.  your children will most likely stay home from school due to illness since you're a smoker!  i say stop being selfish and get some help.|`|IwaTzQqxaa	okay.. im going to get a million thumbs down for this.. but I'm just letting you know what my doctor said to me.. i recently switched to a new doctor.. so I actually have 2 opinons on it to share<br>  <br>  my first doctor.. told me that 3-5 a day was perfectly fine.. my new one told me that up to 10 a day wouldnt have an effect at all.. but that quitting fully after being a smoker for YEARS smoking over a pack a day could stress out the baby and cause more harm than good.. just to make sure its under 10 a day.. and avoid smoking in the house.. and once the baby is here.. do NOT smoke in the house or around him|`|xnhwmontaa	I smoked with my second and my baby was a low birth weight. I am now on my third and have stopped smoking. It's not that hard its a mind over matter thing. I just told myself I didn't want it. And I made my husband not smoke around me. I am now four weeks without a smoke and I am almost nine weeks|`|i8Ch743Laa	I know this feeling. Very well. I've had a really really hard time with this as well. I've been able to cut back some,but not as much as I should even. I won't shout,as I'm here as well. My daughter was 7 lb 7 oz and totally healthy. I'll star this question,and see if you get any good answers. I know that it's a lot harder than people ever think it could be.Wish you the best!!|`|su9CEx0eaa	No shouting but just remember its your un born child smoking as well!|`|ehvUYsgLaa	irresponsible|`|d1csiCLKaa	I am not pg yet, im ttc#3 and also giving up smoking.<br>  Try and avoid places or times of the day when you would normally smoke. I smoke right after having my dinner and sitting at the computer, i have found that having a bottle of water and having some fruit really helped.<br>  I prepare little bags of fruit or veg in the morning, i put sliced peppers and chopped carrots in one bag, red peppers are height in vitamin c. I also buy fruit on a daily basis, just so it doesn't go off.<br>  <br>  If you haven't got a hight will power to give uo then speak to your midwife and she will reccomend what you can do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|0iUxfCMcaa	for one my doctor informed me its not good to use the patch while you are pregnant. hello people the patch puts the nicotine right into your blood stream every time you get an urge to smoke. with smoking it has a filter on the cigs and you dont get as much nicotine in you blood stream as you would with the patch. ok i know its hard trust me been there and done that, the best thing i found to do is cut back each day like if you smoke 10 right now cut back tom to 9 and then in like 2 days cut down to 8. try to chew gum or suck on lollipops to help the urge to have something in your mouth or try hold a pen or pencil in your hand like you would do with a cig. some people have the urge just to hold the cig. good luck and dont let know one tell you your a bad person we all have faults in life and need to look at our own before tellling others they are bad :)|`|0psCy0XXaa	My ex smoked all through her pregnancy including the odd bit of green which i was not happy with but iy calmed her down and my boy is really clever, in fact his mental age is 5 but he in not even 3 yet.  I'm not saying you should do the same but try and stay calm and happy and you should have a nice straight forward pregnancy.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	most importantly just dont buy anymore ciggys and throw your lighters away<br>  then you cant just go and have one<br>  <br>  tell everyone that you want to quit tell them not to offer you a ciggy and dont go out for a ciggy when everyone else does.<br>  <br>  go to the doctors and ask for advice since your pregnant you may need a special kind of patch or something else to help|`|tFfUMQtyaa	PLEASE THINK OF YOUR UNBORN BABY!!!!<br>  Caution TRUTH ahead...Smoking when pregnant is SOOOOO IGNORANT,<br>  STOP being so selfish and THINK about your unborn baby's health!!!! <br>  ALL the "Thumbs down ratings" suggests there are a lot of Council estate plebs on here today|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i was a smoker before i fell pregnant and when i did i just quit and went cold turkey and have never looked back. its hard but worth it. think of your kids.

p419TVeVaa	Hi there I too am RH- and trust me there is nothing to really freak out about unless you don't go for your Rhogam shot... what they are concerned about is possible blood to blood transfer for you to the baby or vice versa because if the baby is RH+ then your body may see the baby as a foreign object and begin to attack the babies. It was pretty simple its just a shot in the butt or upper arm (but that hurts). Its an intermuscular shot, and after the birth of your child they will test the babies blood and if the baby is RH+ then you will be given another shot of Rhogam within 48 hours of birth to protect future children that you may carry to make sure your immune system does not attack any future RH+ children that you may carry. Hope this answered your question and good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	I am not negative but the shot they give you is supposed to work and keep you and baby happy and healthy. don't worry too much about it, I am sure you will be fine.|`|Y4s4Om38aa	That means yo do not have Rh proteins in your blood.  It is not an issue for you, but can be for your baby if not taken care off.  No antibodys is a good thing.  Your body produces antibodies when it recognises forign bodys it needs to (or thinks it needs to) attack.  You will get the rogham shot so that you will not develop antibodies to the Rh factors in your babys blood.  It usually does not effect the first child, but if you would deveop antibodies to the first child, any further child you may have issues with since the antibodies will attack the Rh proteins.  Im not exactly sure of the complications, but my mom is O- and my sister and i are both O+ so she went through it with both of us, with no problems.  Nothing to worry about as long as get the rogham shot.  Any further pregancys will be the same...test for antibodies and another rogham shot.<br>  <br>  You can get the negative blood type from 2 positive parents if both are carriers of the negative.   You have to have 2 negative genes to have the negative blood type.  Because of that I know i have the negative gene from my mom.   Since i have + i know i got the + from my dad.  My kids would have a 50/50 chance of getting the - gene from me, so if could get the negative gene from the father, would have - blood type|`|mPhsJ6Fjaa	I had it. nothing really to big to worry bout.<br>  <br>   A woman is at risk when she has a negative Rh factor and her partner has a positive Rh factor. This combination can produce a child who is Rh positive. While the mother's and baby's blood systems are separate there are times when the blood from the baby can enter into the mother's system. This can cause the mother to create antibodies against the Rh factor, thus treating an Rh positive baby like an intruder in her body. If this happens the mother is said to be sensitized.<br>  <br>  A sensitized mother's body will make antibodies. These antibodies will then attack an Rh positive baby's blood, causing it to breaking down the red blood cells of the baby and anemia will develop. In severe cases this hemolytic disease can cause illness, brain damage and even death.<br>  <br>  Sensitization can also occur during a blood transfusion, miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy and even during some procedures, like amniocentesis. Since the antibodies do not disappear and rarely cause a problem in first pregnancies, it is very important to be screened thoroughly and give an accurate medical history to your doctor or midwife.<br>  <br>  The Good News<br>  <br>  Hemolytic disease can be prevented for many women, if they are not already sensitized. Rh immunoglobulin (RhIg) is a blood product given via injection to help the Rh negative mother by suppressing her ability to react to the Rh positive red cells. Reactions to the medication are generally minor, including soreness at the injection sight and sometimes a slight fever.<br>  <br>  Since a small number of unsensitized women may have problems with the end of pregnancy, many practitioners recommend that she be given an injection of RhIg (also known as Rhogam) at 28 weeks gestation, to prevent the few cases of sensitization that occur at the end of pregnancy. Each dose of RhIg lasts about 12 weeks. The mother will also be given RhIg within 72 hours of birth if the child is Rh positive. The baby's blood type can be determined easily after birth by cord blood samples.<br>  <br>  RhIg may also be given after an amniocentesis, miscarriage, abortion or postpartum sterilization (tubal ligation).|`|a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	all negative women get the shot.<br>  <br>  what it does is protect the baby. without it your body would notice that the baby (which is likely to be positive) and attack it as a forgien body.<br>  <br>  the shot tricks your body into accepting the baby and everything will contiune smoothly|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It's nothing really.  I am negative and received the rhogam shot...other then it being a pain in the butt, literally:), it was no big deal<br>  <br>  Your parents can carry negative RH factor even if they are positive...it's almost like a recessive gene, if both have it then their offspring can get it.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	not not something to worry about because im the same way..im 10 weeks now and the only way that they knew was because of an ultra sound
uLdeIhHqaa	You should call her Ped and ask them what to do. <br>  <br>  It will probably agitate her throat more than anything, but I really dont think its going to hurt her it will eventually go down I assume, but, in order to be safe call her Ped!|`|f7bcycfgaa	try to make her throw up, and then go to the doctor if your still worried|`|7XTzXYeBaa	Me younger sister did the same thing, but it was an earing. <br>  Take your child to the hospital ASAP for an x-ray, that'll be able to see it, and if it can harm her, then the'll safly get it out.<br>  God bless<br>  Helena|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It's no big deal. My daughter has been eating hair off the dog since she was old enough to pull it off. She loves to eat hair, fuzz, or pretty much anything she can get her hands on lol. We don't encourage it, and if we see something in her hands we take it away, but sometimes she's too quick. We have found hair and fuzz in her poop (TMI, sorry). As long as your girl's not choking, swallowing a little fuzz is harmless.|`|WGXdfh22aa	if she just swallowed cotton she should be fine. if she was going to choke she would have already choked when she first ate it. since its just cotton i wouldnt be too concerned it will come out in her poop.|`|V7MYYe7Jaa	Don't worry about it, if she swallowed it, it will come out in her stool.|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	My son is nearly 8mths and he's swallowed chunks of babywipes and paper and it hasn't harmed him...their at the age where everything goes in their mouths and you have to be quick to get it lol :-)
vmWEm4Jzaa	i guess i would say just the shape of their bodies changes-legs get longer or they gain weight and then get taller all of a sudden. children really do grow over night! one day they can be a chubby little baby and a week later they can look totally different. it really is amazing! my first son was very chubby and has short legs-im talking michelin man chubby and he took forever to walk. but my second son was thinner and taller and walked really early but then again he had an older brother he wanted to follow around. i think that makes a difference too. but this is all just my opinion so im not sure its worth much!|`|tmh42R6Caa	As you know, babies are curled up in the womb for 9 months.  I noticed for several months after delivering my son that he would always be curled up.  When holding him, his legs were curled up.  When he slept, his legs were curled up.  It takes a while for them to finally stretch out.  Also, I can't imagine they have much muscle in those legs because they've never really been used.  So it's not so much about the body changing as it is just using parts they've never used before.  Balance is tough, but so is depth perception and just understanding what is going on.  Even now that my son is a good walker (16 months), he never realized that he needs to look down and where he's going.  He'll try to just plow right through a pair of shoes or a toy.  He doesn't realize that there are obsticles in the way.      Does that help??|`|NSBL9bDFaa	wow! tough question! well i dont know if this helps but i know that from the time they are born, they have a reflex that makes them bounce every time you stand them on both feet. They can't hold themselves up obviously, but allowing the baby to practice this reflex over and over, builds the strength in their legs to help them support their weight. It also seems like once all their nerve connections have become stronger, and they have more control over those flailing little bodies, you can see it click...like..."ahh haa!!...those are MY legs...and i can use them to get from this couch...to that table....sweet!"

She's only 4 and 1/2 month old.<br>  I hope she will grow up to still be sociable like her daddy ...

puEjSoDfaa	Go to the courts and petition for a judicial bypass. She will sit down with a judge and explain how she plans to pay for this, what she knows about the procedure, and about herself and her life. If the judge thinks that she is mature enough OR that it is in her best interest, they will grant her it, and that means she doesn't need to notify her parents. That's what I had to do, I'm only 17. Look on plannedparenthood.org for locations. Also they can help you with the court thing.|`|1u4CS5J3aa	<a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/33595.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles...</a><br>  read that site it states that Florida Appeals Court Rules That Minor Can Obtain Abortion Without Notifying Parents. good luck i hope you don't get too much flack for posting this it is truly your choice and no one should try to talk you out of it especially if her parents are like you say they are.|`|AA12020110	I hope this will be a learning experience that does not repeat itself in a year or so.  IF you want kids in the future then Wait until you are ready to have kids to have intercourse because the chances of being infertile increase with abortion.  <br>  There are a lot of health concerns to consider.  <br>  Sometimes an early (key is early) abortion is safer than a 17 year old trying to carry a baby to term.  <br>  YOU may not feel any guilt, but chances are high that even wanting an abortion _SHE_  will feel guilt.  I hope you get over your "It is all about ME"  attitude and be there for her when this is over.  You are not showing the maturity  to even have a girlfriend let alone be a parent.  All I see by your postings is a Panicked Kid who got caught and does not want to face the consequences of actions.  You and your young lady need to find different hobbies, having unprotected sex does not seem to have worked for you.|`|cnssh7v3aa	wow lol you said it , you guys are stupid IMMATURE  teenagers. <br>  who shouldn't be having sex in the first place, dont give me the bs were young, im 17, married and expecting a baby girl in may! <br>  Dont have sex unless you can handle the outcome. Your the reason why adults never give teens any respect, cause you f****** immature!! <br>  I was engaged 6 months before we found out we were pregnant, so no i didn't get married cause o f the baby. <br>  If she is so worried about getting fat, she shouldn't have sex, its not fat just to let you know, its a baby and its a beautiful thing.  <br>  Grow up and stop having sex till your mature enough to deal with theconsequencess.<br>  <br>  If i ever meet your gf i would love to beat her a**.|`|xS1fLOueaa	I'm not exactly pro or anti abortion, but I think that if you're not able to take care of a baby, go ahead. I don't think the fetus stage is exactly living either. Especially since she recently got pregnant, the baby is nothing but a shape in her stomach that resembles a peanut. (A little off topic, sorry.) Here's a complete list of abortion clinics in FL. <br>  <a href="http://www.abortion.com/abortion_clinics_state.php?country=United%20States&state=Florida" rel="nofollow">http://www.abortion.com/abortion_clinics...</a><br>  You may think that they're too far away, but take the trip, okay? If you wait any longer it may be too late to get the abortion and she'll be stuck with a baby. Best of luck.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	You know all these "Florida laws" but didn't know what a condom was?  I'd say you're screwed!<br>  <br>  Hmmmm.  You posted an answer about how you are 17, married and had been so for 3 years because you got your wife pregnant and weren't ashamed to admit it.  Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that you are a troll.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Actually, you need a parent's consent to get an abortion in Florida.<br>  My boyfriend wanted me to get one a year ago.<br>  You can get a waiver from a judge saying you don't need a parent's consent.<br>  The abortion will cost 400 dollars, up front, at a Planned Parenthood.<br>  Or with another abortion provider, I dunno, we were going to go through Planned Parenthood.<br>  <br>  Why don't you look up the abortion laws, and the costs and providers in Florida?<br>  It's pretty easy, just Google it.<br>  <br>  Thank you for not having this child.<br>  Your girlfriend sounds really immature.

And that is what happens if you cant take the consiquenses of your actions. But wringing such a long question might actualy prefent the people reading this that might be able to awnser your question. <br>  <br>  Rather just try. Where and how can I get abortion done in where ever you want it done? Short and sweet.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	No offense, but if you're old enough to have sex, you are old enough to explore options like birth control and abortions too.  You need to go to Planned Parenthood.  Look it up in the phone book.|`|0unqJPehaa	She may want to abort now, but when she gets older she can start feeling guilty and it can cause emotional and psychological damage. It has happened before.<br>  <br>  <br>  I can't stand teens who have sex and then the girl gets prego and wants to abort, and it is very unfair for the child who never gets to grow up and have a life. This is why teens need to stop having sex, they can't handle the consequences, if you both have parents who won't support you and worried about money, don't have sex until you two are more stable. What if she gets prego again? Going to kill another baby?<br>  <br>  <br>  How would you feel if your parents just decided to abort you? Think about that for a while, think about not existing and enjoying life.<br>  <br>  Watch this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WLBl2b9b3k" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WLBl2b9b...</a><br>  <br>  If you still feel like aborting your baby, you have to be pretty heartless..<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, not always true about "Studies/statistics show that babies in which couldn't have been aborted (due to abortion being illegal) grow up to become a higher statistic of crime." Anyone can just turn to crime, doesn't matter if you come from teen parents or your income and all that.  I think that is an excuse for people who don't care about killing babies and it helps themselves feel better.<br>  <br>  You just want to abort because you want to take the easy way out and do not want to take responsibility for your actions. How selfish..<br>  <br>  <br>  "Abortion ends a pregnancy by destroying and removing the developing child. That baby’s heart has already begun to beat by the time the mother misses her period and begins to wonder if she might be pregnant (about 31 days after the mother’s last menstrual period or LMP). [3] Surgical abortions are usually not performed before seven weeks, or 49 days LMP. [4] By that time, the baby has identifiable arms and legs (day 45)[5] and displays measurable brain waves (about 40 days).[6] During the seventh through the tenth weeks, when the majority of abortions are performed,[7] fingers and genitals appear and the child’s face is recognizably human. [8]"<br>  <br>  Your babies heart started beating when your gf missed her period, how can you not feel gulity about this?  So sad you want to murder an innocent baby..|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I live in FL. Sorry, but you can't get an abortion without your parents knowing. I don't care if you don't have parents at all.. If you were mature enough to have sex, you sure as hell should be mature enough to raise a child. I'm 15, baby's father wants nothing to do with me or my baby, yet I didn't abort. Stop saying you have no other option, you have to, or anything else. You WANT to kill a child, that isn't a must. BTW, there's a higher chance she won't be able to concieve a child after getting an abortion. And honestly, I hope people like you never become parents. A stupid piece of sh*t, and she's no different. Grow the **** up and take care of the damn child that you created. Kay?

1u4CS5J3aa	Metformin can help balance your weight even though you are not large sometime even losing 5 lbs can make a big difference. My OB offered clomid to me but I got pregnant with out it (i have mild pcos) I tried the metformin and found it made me too ill to continue to take it but its worth a try.

I must say that first of all you shouldn;t expect emiracle's to happen in a short span of taking this before you should notice the difference. Give it a good 3-6 mths for ur system to get adjusted to the medicine. <br>  <br>  However, i'd say i have heard that this tablet could help balance your weight etc. but i haven;t lost any weight with it. Not a lbs. <br>  <br>  I am alot better now, PCOS symptoms are almost gone...infact none. But i will have to continue with this through child bearing age. My cycle is regulated and i am ovulating its all good. <br>  <br>  I must say one thing, stop reading into things too much...Life is complicated enough as it is for us TTC.

GWveqx61aa	i totally hate that 2ww,  i love the dollar store though, can take a test everyday, lol.i should get af anytime from tomorrow to march 1st, typically i have a 31 day cycle, thanks to clomid, my ovulation felt more like my period was coming, but every now and then when i move wrong i feel those sharp pains, but thats only recently, right now im 13dpo, no signs of internal life except darker nipples. i did get pregnant once before, and at that time i got real bad heartburn but that was after i found out i was preg, and never nauseated, but that preg only lasted 8 weeks. everyone has different things that happen to them, like you feel dry some feel super wet, like they peed. well well be peeing on a stick right about the same times, so ill pray for you, and good luck and baby dust to you|`|AA11025973	Hey! I had the exact same thing when I got pregnant about  2 years ago. The only other thing I had (with the symptoms you listed) was I was extremely hungry (I am 120 lbs and never eat much and I would eat steak, shrimp, mozzarella sticks, pizza, and dessert; in one night lol) At the time I didn't think much of it because I wasn't trying to get pregnant and was on BC. Well to my surprise I ended up being pregnant. But unfortunately I have PCOS and lost the baby at about 6 weeks; and I have been trying since with no luck :[ So even if you end up not being pregnant (which you could very likely be!!) Keep your head up. Five months isn't really too long to be trying and maybe this month was your month!! :] I'll say a prayer and send some baby dust your way! Keep me posted!!|`|NkGTSqBdaa	Oh I know exactly how you feel and I have that exact type of pain in my right ovary but I normal get this just before my period is due. The sign of nausea and your vagina being dry are a very good sign. I have also heard of people saying that they just knew when they were pregnant and its strange but I wonder how they know! Every month I keep my fingers crossed and I hope that I will get my positive. I will keep my fingers crossed for you too and lots of baby dust to you xx|`|jaP0TANdaa	I feel your pain and wish I could answer your question... but, I haven't been lucky enough to get my BFP yet, so I really have no success stories to tell to reassure you. I have heard MANY women say though that their "symptoms" during early pregnancy was really their lack of their usual PMS symptoms... so, they thought for sure their cycle was a bust because they had no symptoms at all, not even their usual PMS stuff! But, turns out they finally got their BFP. I'd assume that any changes that vary drastically from your "normal" cycle could indicate pregnancy. It's so different for each woman that the best advice I've gotten is that when you KNOW that you just don't feel like you usually do... you're pregnant. But of course, we TTC'ers over-analyze everything and notice every little twinge, so we convince ourselves sometimes. Anyway, good luck and tons of baby dust and I hope you get some answers soon.
8RfmosODaa	Baby Dust to you too! This month wasn't my month either!|`|eytlIKITaa	Oh Dear!  I'm sorry to hear that you got your period!

z788YHPLaa	Just to be on the safe side go to your doctor! They will be able to tell you definitely!!!|`|t46cH4qDaa	Try another pregnancy test and if ur getting the same thing. Go to the doc's and get blood work done.|`|6B03moFwaa	ANY line on the pregnancy line is YES! your body doesn't make ANY of that hormone if you are not pregnant. If you tested positive and then negative I would wait a day and try again in the MORNING. When you held it in most of the night and it is more concentrated. It it tests negative then you probably were for a few days and it didn't take. REMEMBER that most pregnancy tests can have a false NEGative, but very very rarely a false Positive. good luck!
awGzfTXGaa	yes it is positive, if they're was no color,it would be negative.you are pregnant.   congratulations!|`|GEfpzUNvaa	what were you testing for pregnancy?? wait till you period is late.. good luck|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Test again.. The faintest line could be positive maybe you have low HCG levels and that's why it wasnt a bright line. test again maybe the last test you took was defetive if the same thing happens wait untill you miss your period to test again. That's when you best could get an accurate result.. good luck!
ZNTLSCLhaa	It sounds like you have the symptoms of pregnancy.  I think just wait until you are bout a week past your period and if you still haven't gotten it then take a home pregnancy test.  If that comes out negative wait a few more days to another week and test again.  If still nothing - check with your doctor.  There could be other things happening, but I hope it's a baby for you!!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!|`|AfdyNi9Raa	Many of the symptoms of pregnancy can be confused with those of the onset of your period.   As you want to be pregnant you are more sensitive to any changes.  You can confirm pregnancy buy using a home test but make sure you use early morning urine.  This is most concentrated in hCG so should give a result.  If it is negative you are not pregnant but wait another few days to confirm pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Rxi8wu5Paa	you could be preg best of luck!!|`|12eBxCzAaa	I think you should go to the docs to get an accurate result.....some of the symptoms could be from being due on too!?|`|14RzmDTmaa	sounds good to me, i would go to the doc and get a blood test, good luck and keep us posted.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	I mean,it sounds like your pregnant.

I liked the rest :)|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Those are all fine names.  If her name is Emily, why call her Emma?  I was confused by that.  If you'll call her Emma, just name her Emma.  That's my 2 cents on that part.<br>  <br>  They are however, very common first names you've listed.  Just keep that in mind.|`|AA11109728	Wow!  I voted, and I love them all!  I couldn't even choose a favorite, they are all nice names.  I'm partial to Kaitlyn, but I like the other ones just as much.  I like your son's name as well!  I think you've got talent in the naming dept.!  LOL|`|AA11273571	I voted and like your names except Kaitlyn b/c too popular.  My own suggestions are Jessa Danielle, Ebbe Danielle, and Evan Danielle.

You may as well just go for Emma :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6m6LjAVNaa	What is the deal with the letter K?<br>  I really like of these<br>  Emma Danielle <br>  I do not like Madison at all it is done to death.<br>  Cara is a girl i know who is a liar,and back stabber so i do not like this especially with the k.<br>  Jacob Malachi is very nice spelled like this in my opinion,i never cared for misspelled names just to be different,but to each their own i guess.<br>  Madeline Danielle is also nice i think.Good luck!|`|5sZgu4BQaa	I love the name Kaitlyn even though my husband hates the name and wont let me use it. But I still love it I prefer Caitlyn for the spelling though it just looks so well rounded. My sisters girls are Areana and Nikita Franca.

Def3uk2aaa	sounds like you strained your ab muscles from dry humping!  it's been known to happen. :)|`|E6T9DPT9aa	You've pulled a muscle?    USE A CONDOM!!!    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|GGH0HVdvaa	your muscles are probably sore from all the activity. it happens. i wouldn't worry too much about it.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	ues a condom|`|QQlbvWj4aa	He's probably just heavier than you, so the pressure made your stomach sore.  It's happened to me.  If you're worried about pregnancy... very little chance.|`|Foz9RTdJaa	didnt have a good nights sleep if he didnt get in you that ur ok|`|kaPnRKcwaa	probably just sore from the physically activate that happened. muscles that haven't been used in awhile    I'm sure its nothing to worry about.|`|iUwyd7o5aa	ok your not pregnet .. that happends when your messing around (gry humping) your muscles get sore and feels like youve been working out   dont worry im pretty sure your not pregnet plus once you get your period after you had sex and i dont mean just spotting but and actual 6 day period your forsure not pregnet|`|3HWV0AkKaa	its probably nothing if he didnt actually go all the way!!! but there could be a chance since you only used a condom you should get a preggo test. good luck!!|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Just because your stomach hurts doesn't mean you're pregnant.  Don't worry.  Use protection.  You'll be fine.  If it still hurts in a few days go to the doctor.
ai4lrclMaa	She will continue to go the right place sometimes and the wrong place others for quite some time. You can shorten the time this takes by not stressing yourself or her about it. Just say "Oh let's clean that up then and bribe her with things like "When you have no more accudents we can wear these pretty big girl pants. Buy her some really frilly undies (aussie for panties) and let her see that they are her reward.<br>  <br>  But don't say things like Only babies wear diapers....or she will start to feel bad if she has an accident.<br>  <br>  She had a long time to develop the habit of pooping in her pants...and she won't forget how easy and convenient that was overnight!! Also she won't yet recognise all the signs that she needs to go...like feeling the twinge in her belly or breaking wind. She'll learn. 22 months is really good for the level you say she's at. Just keep doing it gently. She sounds like a quick learner.|`|0ky4TktEaa	I disagree to a certain extent about associating diapers with babies. Right now is not the time to tell her that. Move her to pull ups and THEN start associating diapers for babies. There's a reason for that.<br>  <br>  It's clear she's ready to be trained. Start making her go and sit on it every hour on the hour. Learn her schedule and work from there. Keep it up with the pull ups, just remind her to keep them dry. You may want to go to the store and buy some "big girl panties" and make a huge deal out of it. Remind her that she has to keep her pull up dry though. Continue to send her every hour. Even if she can hold it for a few hours; still send her no less than every 2 hours.<br>  <br>  When you get home, you can try out the big girl panties. I'd advise using rubber pants to keep accidents from getting all over. Make sure you send her every 1-2 hours no matter how busy she/you may be. She needs to know that it's ok to put something down to go potty and then come back to it. After a week with the rubber pants, give it a try without them. Save the pull ups for nap/bed time ONLY. <br>  <br>  As for pooping, it's often more work than teaching them to pee in the potty. Same thing though. Learn her poop schedule and work from there. If you see her squatting or looking like she's trying to go, send her to the potty. Remind her every so often where poop goes. Tell her she better not poop in her underwear. At this point, some children will be stubborn about it. Many kids scream for a diaper when they need to poop. DO NOT GIVE IT TO HER. Make her sit on the potty. If she doesn't go; allow her to get up with a reminder that she better not poop in her panties. This is where saying diapers are for babies comes in. Once you get a child hyped up about big kid underwear, they don't want to go back to diapers and pull ups are only seen as being used for when they go to bed. Tell them they'll get a "baby" diaper if they poop in their underwear and many of them understand what that means. Obviously, this is not to be used until it's clear they're just being stubborn.|`|qiUo1CTYaa	A strategy that I have used that may work for you is to get yourself a cheap kitchen timer.  After you have taken your daughter to the potty, set the timer for 30 mins.  When the timer goes off take her to the potty again.  (I find the timer helpful in case I forget to look at the clock but also it gives your child an audible reminder to go to the toilet too once you have been doing it a few times)  Let her wear underwear, as Pull ups are too much like nappies for her to really be able to tell the difference.  By wearing undies, she will be much more aware if she wets herself.  Save the pulls up for nap time and for when you are going out and need the extra back up, but for around home if she seems ready and receptive, then give the undies and regular reminders a try!  I have used this method several times with a quick success rate, but it doesn't work for everyone of course.  The idea is to take them often enough that you have 100% success rate and boost their confidence, not try and go as long as possible between potty times, if your lucky she won't need to be taken at 30 min intervals for long before she is managing well all the time.  (its ok if she doesn't go every time you take her, just say good try, maybe you will do a wee next time)|`|Z2ErfHpoaa	Let her run around without any pants on. It may sound weird, but most children cannot stand the feel of urine running down their legs. Tell her what to say when she needs to go, then let her go. It might take a few tries, but she'll get the point. Good luck!
z2TjjnxVaa	No. That's not very old. By the time the kids 20 he'd be in their 70's and a lot of people last well into their 80's and now 90's with better medication. You could have a 20 year old as a godparent and they could die at any time. Just choose who you would want.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Is he in good health?  Well no matter how few years he has left, if he is a good man, he is worth 10 mediocre men.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	My Nanna is the GodMother of our daughters. She is in her 70's, but I feel she is the right one to teach them about their religion.|`|BthSjSEHaa	No, not too old at all. And a big part of being a God parent is giving advice to the child, if they ask for it. So an older person with life experiences would be an excellent God parent, in my opinion.|`|KQU5y20waa	not at all. it all depends an how well you trust the responsibilities of that person...... to ease your mind.....have a 2nd party person. i do...lol|`|AYrS226Iaa	absolutely not. its not the age, really its more the person. i think that that is perfectly fine.|`|CQTV4ntqaa	My aunt and my uncle are my daughters god parents. My aunt is in her middle 50's and my uncle early 60's. They are wonderful to her and I don't think I could of made a better choice. Good luck!|`|ZbaodGQYaa	no he is not too old the important thig is that he is the right one for your daughter.
0iUxfCMcaa	at 24wks you would be induced to give birth to the baby. it would probably feel just as painful as regular labor you would get naturally. im not sure what they would do with the baby. they probably will let you see it if you want to. at 24wks the baby looks like a baby just really small probably 1lb or less. i really dont think they do a d+c that late in pregnancy, but im not sure about that.|`|ZYouNFQbaa	If you lost a baby at 24wks then yes you would have to go to hospital.  It would be classed as still born, they start the labour off but I'm not entirely sure how, when they start a labour off at over due, they have a gel that they put on the cervix to start it off.  The baby would look normal (my friend gave birth at 25weeks and her son is now 2) and it would hurt the same as normal labour with regard to contractions but it would be a smaller baby so unsure to total pain.  They will allow you to hold the baby and name the baby and say your goodbye to it before taking it from you. You can take photo's also. <br>  At this late stage, there is no other way of doing it.|`|bAp35x7uaa	Yes, sadly you would have to give birth to it.  It would be classed as a stillbirth and labour would be induced.<br>  <br>  It is unlikely that they would do a d&c (dilation and curretage) at 24 weeks - this tends to only be used early on in pregnancy (first 12 weeks) OR if something is left behind. A D&C works by dilating the uterus then gently clearing the uterine lining to remove any remaining tissue.|`|Coc593Ikaa	If you lost a baby at 24 weeks, it is not a miscarriage, it is a stillbirth.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	At 24 weeks if you have your baby it is not a miscarriage, it is considered a "still birth". The baby has an 80% chance of being born alive if the mother goes into labour at that stage in her pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The baby could be born already dead, and if they know in advance the baby is already dead then they would induce labour, you would push the baby out like a normal delivery but the birth certificate would say still birth rather than live birth. Treatment afterwards would be a one day maximum hospital stay, maybe some pain meds depending on the experience and counselling for your loss.<br>  <br>  The baby would be fully formed and weigh between 1-1.5 lbs. They really only gain weight and finish developing their lungs from this point on.<br>  <br>  A D&C is an abortion, or a purging of the uterus after a miscarriage, but it does not happen that late in a pregnancy.|`|BFL2GFF4aa	<a href="http://readyin.surfs.it" rel="nofollow">http://readyin.surfs.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|0vpDDM8aaa	of course it would be fully formed...a baby's heart starts to beat by 6 weeks...and his little arms and legs (and fingers and toes) are all sticking out by 10-11 weeks.|`|BWu5tcozaa	i dont understand . lost baby how by stillbirth or abortion?|`|AA11066099	Please ask to speak to your practice nurse. A d&c is a scrape to remove anything left behind.x|`|i8Ch743Laa	I lost my son at 20 weeks. I had him,naturally (i went into labor). I know they offer medicines to people,but I had mine with none. You'd be in the hospital I'd imagine for a day or two. I was only in for a few hours. You'd have to give birth,there's no way they could just go in and take it out. You'd have to be induced. I didn't think it hurt.  I got a prescription for tylenol 3 for the after pain. Time frame,it's different for every woman. It would be fully formed,but again I had mine at 20 weeks,and his skin wasn't fully formed. The option of what they do with the baby,it's your choice. I wanted mine to have him cremated,but if you turn it over to the hospital,they'll have it incinerated. My son at 20 weeks was 8 lb 8 oz. He was almost fully formed,but the skin wasn't. A D&C is where they go in to remove what wasn't removed,I was supposed to have one ,the dr didn't do one,therefore causing me to almost bleed to death 5 months later. They didn't even check if I needed one.|`|XSP24wJ7aa	If you lost a baby at 24 weeks then its a still birth. You would have to give birth to it and it would hurt although not as much as a actual labor. You would be out of hospital within a few hours and they would give you pain relief. The baby then goes to the morgue and normal funeral arrangements can be made. It would of fully formed and weight about 2 or three pounds.<br>  <br>  A D&C is a surgical procedure often performed after a first trimester miscarriage.
qBl9ShJBaa	substitute breast milk for a bottle except at night.it will hurt at first but it will go down.and try the book called "on becoming baby wise". my new born woke up every two hours and when i used this book he started to sleep around 4-6 hours before waking up. now he is 9 months and he sleeps from 8:00 pm to 9:30am every night.just have to stick with it.good luck|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	While you certainly can encourage her not to nurse during the day and do all her nursing at night going all day without nursing is just going to cause more plugged ducts.    There are effective ways of dealing with plugged ducts and oversupply.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...  What are the usual causes of plugged ducts or mastitis?     Milk stasis / restricted milk flow   may be due to:        * Engorgement or inadequate milk removal        (due to latching problems, ineffective suck, tongue-tie or other anatomical variations, nipple pain, sleepy or distracted baby, oversupply, hurried feedings, limiting baby's time at the breast, nipple shield use, twins or higher order multiples, blocked nipple pore, etc.).      * Infrequent/skipped feedings        (due to nipple pain, teething, pacifier overuse, busy mom, return to work, baby suddenly sleeping longer, scheduling, supplementing, abrupt weaning, etc.).      * Pressure on the duct        (from fingers, tight bra or clothing, prone sleeping, diaper bag, etc.).      * Inflammation        (from injury, bacterial/yeast infection, or allergy).      http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...  Recurrent Mastitis or Plugged Ducts      Are you interrupting feedings or cutting them short (due to outdated advice to limit nursing duration, a busy schedule, taking care of other children or family members, etc.)? This can lead to a backup of milk in the breast and thus increases the risk for engorgement, plugged ducts, or mastitis.    Do you press down on the top or side of your breast to make extra breathing space for baby? This should not be necessary (baby's nose is designed so baby can breathe while nursing) and can cause plugged ducts and/or sore nipples.    [...]    Are you having problems with oversupply or engorgement? Do you feel that you have too much milk? Does your baby choke, gag, strangle when nursing because of a fast milk flow? Do you leak a lot? Remedying the oversupply will help to reduce your risk for plugged ducts and mastitis.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/fast-l...  Adjust your supply to better match baby's needs        * If baby is gaining weight well, then having baby nurse from only one breast per feeding can be helpful.            o If baby finishes nursing on the first side and wants to continue nursing, just put baby back onto the first side.            o If the second side becomes uncomfortable, express a little milk until you're more comfortable and then use cool compresses - aim for expressing less milk each time until you are comfortable without expressing milk.      * Avoid extra breast stimulation, for example, unnecessary pumping, running the shower on your breasts for a long time or wearing breast shells.      * Between feedings, try applying cool compresses to the breast (on for 30 minutes, off for at least an hour). This can discourage blood flow and milk production.      * If nursing one side per feeding is not working after a week or so, try keeping baby to one side for a certain period of time before switching sides. This is called block nursing.            o Start with 2-3 hours and increase in half-hour increments if needed.            o Do not restrict nursing at all, but any time that baby needs to nurse simply keep putting baby back to the same side during that time period.            o If the second side becomes uncomfortable, express a little milk until you're more comfortable and then use cool compresses - aim for expressing less milk each time until you are comfortable without expressing milk.            o In more extreme cases, mom may need to experiment a bit with time periods over 4 hours to find the amount of time per breast that works best.      * Additional measures that should only be used for extreme cases of oversupply include cabbage leaf compresses and herbs.    Even if these measures do not completely solve the problem, many moms find that their abundant supply and fast let-down will subside, at least to some extent, by about 12 weeks (give or take a bit). At this point, hormonal changes occur that make milk supply more stable and more in line with the amount of milk that baby needs.      http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/vitami...   Lecithin treatment for recurrent plugged ducts    By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC    Lecithin has been recommended to combat recurrent plugged ducts. The usual recommended dosage for recurrent plugged ducts is 3600-4800 mg lecithin per day, or 1 capsule (1200 milligram) 3-4 times per day. After a week or two with no blockage, mom can reduce the dosage by one capsule. If there is no blockage within another 2 weeks she can reduce it again by one. Mom may need to continue taking 1-2 capsules per day if stopping the lecithin leads to additional plugged ducts.    Lecithin is a very common food additive, and is found naturally in many other foods. There are no known contraindications to its use by breastfeeding mothers.    The reason why lecithin may help resolve and prevent plugged ducts is not clear. Per Dr. Jack Newman, "It may do this by decreasing the viscosity (stickiness) of the milk, by increasing the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the milk." Lecithin is an emulsifier (used to keep fats/oils dispersed and in suspension): phospholipid molecules (such as lecithin) contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements; the hydrophobic portion has an affinity for fats and oils, and|`|yIGxQ9Glaa	Yeap, here you go:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8iY2yxrx...

Some people like to stick with one feeding to begin with and add more foods eventually to that feeding time before adding other times.  It is up to the parent how you do this.  You know your baby better than anyone else.      I used to start with a little cereal in the night feeding.  Then I went to two feedings of the cereal.  After that I added the yellow fruits and vegetables such as applesauce, pears, peaches, bananas, squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, etc. waiting three days between adding the new foods to watch for reactions.  He knows when he has had enough.  For the first year formula or breast milk is supposed to be the main source of nutrition so I would not worry too much about if he is eating enough.  He knows.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if that is all he wants that is fine; as long as he keeps drinking his bottle he will be ok; he will probably eat more as he gets the hang of it and gets a little older; no worries|`|qBl9ShJBaa	i do cereal in the morning and veggies at night that way he doesn't get a sugar rush right before bed.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Why not when you have your dinner too? Make a set time. My sons is around 5 - 5:30 pm.  I gave him cereal when I ate breakfast and then I gave him cereal when I at dinner and when you add in that third feeding make it when you have lunch. He should eat at normal meal times.  In a few months you will be giving him fruits and veggies at lunch and meats and veggies at dinner.       This works perfect for my family. Then we can all eat together.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	My daughter is 6 months and we give her barley cereal twice a day--usually around 8:30 and then again at 2.  I just started her on sweet potatoes around 5:30 and I was going to do 4-5 days per vegetable/fruit for at least another month.  I only do about 2 tbs. at each of these meals and I don't push it if she doesn't feel like finishing.    Since most of their nutrition is from breast milk/formula until they're 1, I think what you're doing sounds perfect.
5ds7tfB2aa	Well i already told you what it think and I hope you told her my advice. Either way she needs to tell her mother as she is not emotinally mature enough to make this sort of decision alone and as you have so many factors involved it will seem the best choice now to abort but that may not be what she truely wanted to do. If she does not want a termination and has one just so that she does not make her mother shout or cry well she will never forgive herself. You can look at it from the point of view that it is a baby and that you are going to kill it but on the other hand it is just a bundle of cells that will mutate into a living thing but at the moment it is just a parasite, a bunch of cells feeding of you like a cancer so all you people out there yelling murder need to keep your opnions to yourselves because you are not the ones in this situation and you would be thinking differently if it was your daughter so if you cant be helpful then i think silence is the way to go, this is a time where we need to give adivice to help the girl make the best decision for herself, her family and what could become her baby and change the lives of everyone she knows forever not just to yell murder. Whatever happens she needs to turn to her mother right now before this goes any further so that she will not be alone in making the hardest decision she will ever have to make and i worry that fear will push her going against her hearts desires. The main reason for being is to reproduce, it is the same for every creature on this earth we are here to carry on the spieces and to keep our place on the food chain. The female body is made to have children and to want to nurture them so i dont think adoption is the best way to go, that will be even harder than termination having to see the baby once all your hormones have changed, look at it once then give it away never knowing whether it went to safe place or even still alive and happy or if you will ever see then again, if they will hate you etc. Please please urge her to speak to her mother, tell her to go out to a friends house and send her mother a text, or and email or send a letter in the post. Or maybe she could ask one of her friends mothers to speak to her , there are so many ways if she cannot sit down with her and tell her. And sharing this information with her mother, for them to go through something like this together will strengthen their bond.Even in the darkest of times there is a light but you must look for it carfully or it could be consumed by the shadows.|`|AA11497994	i agree with both carlos and silly but lets take it from the top here.no she should not terminate t because believe it or not everything happens for reason and she should own up to her responsibility. 2nd of course she have to tell her parents. they would still love her no matter what. now no one is saying that they wont get a upset but come on we have to be realistic here.they would. but soon after they would help her true it and be very proud loving grandparents. however if she does decide to terminate it she should still tell her mom mainly because to ensure that she goes to aa qualified doctor who knows what they are doing so that your friend doesn't get infected or hurt.the bottom line to my advice is KEEP IT THE BABY.a baby is a blessing in disguise|`|JESU9vkraa	Your friend should talk to her boyfriend to see if he wants to settle down.

If she has the baby, she has to remember that she has another person other than herself to take responsibility of, and the rest of her life will no longer remain the same. But if she gets an abortion, her conscience will change too. I think it's unfair to kill a baby with abortion, but it's even more unfair to bring it into the world if it's going to suffer. But in the end, she has to make the decision.|`|dcEXQsiZaa	teenage pregnancy is always a hard thing - the best thing to do would always be to keep the baby. the problem there is that this could interfere with studies as she is still at school. if her parents are willing to take care of it, then that would be perfect.<br>  <br>  The next best thing would be to give it up for adoption. this is always hard, because the mother sees her baby and has to give it away, but there are a lot of families that would be extremely happy to get a baby.<br>  <br>  The third option is abortion. this can be very traumatic, especially afterwards - for the rest of her life the mother will remember her little baby that died.<br>  <br>  Here is a website about what to do if you are a teenager and pregnant and how to handle it<br>  <a href="http://www.womens-health.co.uk/teenspreg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.womens-health.co.uk/teenspreg...</a>|`|BzCYQlcuaa	yes tell her mother either way. if you are getting abortion you really should have a adult with you. if you go to a "cheep" place or something like that you can die or never be able to have kid if this is done incorrectly.    and her mother will be able to help. and the longer you wait the worse this is getting. the mother will be Mad, sad, upset at first but after a day she will just want to protech her daughter. that's her mother Instinct she wants to take all the pain away from her daughter. who care if she is Mad for a Second it will pass and she will get the best help she can.|`|ddP3klT3aa	She should not terminate it. She needs to own up to the consequences of having sex. Maybe adoption would be best, but NOT termination.<br>  Sounds to me like her parents aren't very good parents. I mean, they let her move back just to be with this new boyfriend? Are you sure her parents are not separating? That is very unusual. <br>  Any ways, tell her to give it up for adoption. Tell her not to punish this baby because she had sex irresponsibly.|`|zBz10IiOaa	aww tell her to talkk to her mom the worst that is going to happen is her mom will be upset! nothing to big tell her a baby is a blessing and she will be ok with support|`|PccHbsKbaa	tell her do not have an abortion, that is evil.<br>  adoption is in her best interest|`|oa8m1Rpyaa	keep it cuz u will have that berdun in ur mind|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Ultimately it is up to her to make the decision, no amount of advice will change her mind if it is made up. Personally, I feel she should do what is best for her. Abortion is not the best way to handle things but if it is what she thinks is best then she should do it. She should know it is very hard on her body, mind, and soul and it is something she will have to live with forever. On the other hand there is adoption, which is also hard because you have to let go of your child forever. She can also keep her child and struggle everyday because that child is worth it.
AA12352139	I agree with Sarah M.<br>  <br>  When my wife and I had our first baby, we started expressing milk from the second day and I was able to get involved. It's a brilliant idea  & allowed me to bond quite quickly. It helps the mother to take a break as well.<br>  <br>  For our last child we used the medela  pump and it worked like a charm. Made it really easy and quick to do.<br>  <br>  It's expensive but worth it.: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mothercare.com/gp/product/B000JFJJ4Y/sr=1-1/qid=1235569895/ref=sr_1_1/277-6484045-7527449?ie=UTF8&m=A2LBKNDJ2KZUGQ&n=44553031&mcb=core" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothercare.com/gp/product/B00...</a>|`|vue9NOhYaa	You CAN begin pumping immediately after giving birth. If, for example, you were to have a sick or premature baby in the NICU who couldn't nurse yet, the staff would encourage you to pump your colostrum and early milk so it can be fed to the baby.<br>  <br>  However, if you don't HAVE to pump early, it's best to wait.  Your baby will be nursing VERY  often in those early days and weeks, and you will be tired.  You really don't want to spend valuable time (time you could be spending resting or meeting your own needs) hooked to a pump.  Further, you dont' want to give baby bottles in those early weeks anyway. Early bottles (even of pumped milk) are associated wtih nipple confusion and breastfeeding problems.<br>  <br>  So ... just nurse for the first 2-3 weeks at least.  Then you could begin pumping occassionally and, at 4-6 weeks, introduce the occassional bottle (so you can be away from baby, or daddy can feed.)|`|3NyM1cq5aa	At first you only produce a small amount of colostrum.  It is usually 3-5 days before your milk fully comes in.  After that you should be able to pump enough to give your baby a few ounces in a bottle.  You can pump while you are in the hospital, but you produce such a small amount of colostrum you probably wouldn't be able to feed it to your baby in a bottle.<br>  Congratulations, and good luck!|`|7PXFXcKfaa	breastmilk comes in about 3 ish days after .. however you can start expressing colostrum immediately...<br>  <br>  however know that in the days following the birth, your babies suckling will help bring your milk in a bit faster. Pumping doesnt help this as much as an actual infant does (hormone thing!) <br>  <br>  Also pumping will never produce as much milk as a real live baby will ... i know you want to pump so daddy can help, and thats lovely! But i would suggest that initially you do breastfeed directly, just until you get your supply up and get the whole thing going and comfy. <br>  <br>  You can pump all the time once youve got it down, but at the beginning if i only pumped, i think i probably would have found it impossible to continue. Breastfeeding, although natural, generally is not as easy as people like LLL will fool you into thinking, so just take it one day at a time. <br>  <br>  TBH my little one is now 5 weeks, and im only just starting to feel comfy about BFing. If i was trying to make myself pump in the early weeks, i would have given up and switched to formula!<br>  <br>  Its totally your choice, but i would personally recommend just taking it one day at a time. Go with what feels right for you, and baby. Daddy will be able to participate all the time when you are established and you actually can pump all the time, but until then just focus on you and bubs!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck ... but be aware that you might enjoy breastfeeding more than you imagine!|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	I have several pictures of my son being cup-fed colostrum by his Daddy in the hospital. I had to hand express the colostrum - cue very achey hands for a few precious drops! My milk came in on day 4 I think and by then I could use the hospital's breastpump which made things easier but it was still hard work.<br>  <br>  I would add that we only did this because when my son was born he was poorly and had troubles breastfeeding. I wouldn't recommend it! After he was better & got the hang of feeding, I didn't start expressing again for 4-5 weeks.<br>  <br>  ed:<br>  as Pippin says, bottles very early on are not so good, this is why my son was cup-fed. He wasn't offered a bottle of expressed milk until he was 5-6 weeks old and was well established with breastfeeding.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I had to exclusively express my milk, I used a dual electric breast pump to make it much easier on myself. I started pumping right after my children were born and had the colostrum to feed to them and within 48 hours of giving birth I was able to pump 8-10 oz at each pumping session. This was much more than they were needing so I was storing it. If you are going to breastfeed and express you should get your child used to breastfeeding prior to introducing the bottle.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	It will take your body a while to get used to the milk demand from your baby so first of all you may experience engorgement in your breasts, this is normal and is your body adapting to the baby's feeding needs.<br>  Once your body has got used breast feeding you will start to produce exactly the right amount for your baby.<br>  I was told to wait at least 4 weeks before I started to express milk then told by a health visitor to wait 6 weeks.|`|3fe05dbb27a9cf0081ff4ef9a1434e1faa	It does take some time for your milk to come in at least a couple of days. and even after that you'll want to get the knack of breastfeeding before expressing. If you pump it will tell your body to make more and more milk and it can get painful, so take it slow.|`|7XTzXYeBaa	Good choice! Breastmilk is better for babies, waaay more healthy,,<br>  You can start breastfeeding as soon as you want.

You can supplement a feeding a day with formula, put him in front of a window for some UV rays.  You should also nurse your baby at least 8 - 12 times a day, this will help you make enough milk, and keep the baby’s bilirubin level low.<br>  <br>  My daughter was 6 weeks before her bilirubin levels were normal:)  Hope this helps!

I'd rather bring it up and love him/her  or give him/her up for adoption.<br>  <br>  Neither do I mean to lecture, but your girlfriend is carrying your child, your flesh and blood. Its not an "it" that you can just throw away.<br>  <br>  Plus, abortion can bring other complications, if done incorrectly.<br>  And think about this: What if, that unborn child is going to be your only child or your last chance of having a child? <br>  You never know you might be bring out int the world someone who will finally discover the cure for cancer or maybe the next president of USA...<br>  <br>  Think hard before committing murder, as for abortion is murder.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.

You are sort of at that age where you should be held responsible, birth control and whatnot. There are a few options. You can either have the abortion, or give the baby up for adoption. At least then you can have a little bit more of peace of mind and know that your baby will be raised well.<br>  <br>  You can also take the leap and try to raise it together, but you have to think of everything you are about to encounter.You have to think of financial situations, neither of you live on your own and it would hit very hard to have to figure all of this out while trying to raise a baby.<br>  <br>   Your parents are probably just frustrated, it isn't a situation anybody wants to be in.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh goodness, a second time?

h4UzjZVnaa	I've never heard of that.. But I do suggest intercourse every other day. My husband and I have been trying since Oct. Well my cycles have been off since I stopped taking birth control in Sept. Every time I thought I was ovulating, my period decided to come later than expected. So of course we missed our chance that month. We decided this was our month and we were going to have intercourse every other day until A.) I started my pd or B.) I got my BFP (big fat positive)! So I suggest doing that.. Good luck to us both!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Antibiotics have no influence on pregnancy. (Your husband might be thinking about the fact that they can make birth control pills less effective.)<br>  <br>  The best way to get pregnant is to understand when YOU ovulate, and try to time things so that you have sex a few times in the days leading up to ovulation. (Sperm live for about 5 days in  your body; the egg lives less than a day, so you want to 'try' BEFORE you ovulate, so them sperm will be waiting for the egg.)<br>  <br>  You can expect to ovulate about 14 days before your NEXT period begins, so either time things based on that calculation, or use ovulation predictor kits to get a better sense of how your body works.<br>  <br>  Beyond that ... there isn't much you can do.  Even if everything is perfect, you only have about a 25-30% chance of getting pregnant any single cycle, so it may take a while.  (Most women need 3-6 months -- a few up to a year.)|`|BzCYQlcuaa	well the only "easy" way to get pregnant and to have sex during ovulation. i would make sure you track your ovulation. i used the predict kits for ovulation. they are kind of expensive, but work great. even tho i did all these things and i am healthy it took me a year and 4 months to get pregnant. i think i finally got pregnant because i stopped stressing. my doctor said that stress can prevent pregnancy, not always but sometimes. my advice at FINALLY worked for me if track your ovulation and relax. i relax my getting a hobby! good luck. baby dust.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	100 percent way to get pregnant is have sex every other day till your next period is due.

ddCU9KTWaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IVF. Went through the IVF injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IVF and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is.

I got pregnant 3 times through pre ejaculate in the 60s, before we knew about it. As for him not being all the way in, that makes no difference either as sperm are extremely good swimmers. The best thing to do would be take a pregnancy test if you are at least 7 days late for your next period, if that is negative and you still don't get your period, then wait until you are 10 days late and ask the doctor to take a pregnancy blood test.

His digestive system isn't ready to handle starch. So you put him at increased risk of many health problems, including both short term ones (tummy aches, obesity from too much food, choking [a bigger concern if it's  in a bottle, but also if you force feed it from a spoon], and long term ones (allergies, diabetes, crohns disease, etc.).<br>  <br>  He doesn't need anything but breastmilk or formula at 3 months, so why take even the small risk of harming him? There's absolutely NO rush.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: If he's 'too skinny' (and he probably isn't ... he's probably the weight nature intends for him), then the solution is to offer more MILK.

This can result in damage to the intestines, weight loss, blood in the stool, and malnutrition. You might argue, "Well, my kids started solid foods at three weeks, and they turned out just fine." The truth is, very few adults have perfectly working digestive tracts. Just look at all the commercials for heartburn remedies and stool softeners...

Starting foods too early can result in digestive or allergy problems later in life. We have learned that the old guidelines of 4 months are just too soon, and I am willing to bet that in ten years we will be recommending later than 6 months. But for now, the six month guideline seems reasonable.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/delay-solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  # Delaying solids gives baby's digestive system time to mature.<br>  If solids are started before a baby's system is ready to handle them, they are poorly digested and may cause unpleasant reactions (digestive upset, gas, constipation, etc.). Protein digestion is incomplete in infancy. Gastric acid and pepsin are secreted at birth and increase toward adult values over the following 3 to 4 months. The pancreatic enzyme amylase does not reach adequate levels for digestion of starches until around 6 months, and carbohydrate enzymes such as maltase, isomaltase, and sucrase do not reach adult levels until around 7 months. Young infants also have low levels of lipase and bile salts, so fat digestion does not reach adult levels until 6-9 months.<br>  <br>  # Delaying solids decreases the risk of food allergies.<br>  It is well documented that prolonged exclusive breastfeeding results in a lower incidence of food allergies (see Allergy References and Risks of Artificial Feeding). From birth until somewhere between four and six months of age, babies possess what is often referred to as an "open gut." This means that the spaces between the cells of the small intestines will readily allow intact macromolecules, including whole proteins and pathogens, to pass directly into the bloodstream.This is great for your breastfed baby as it allows beneficial antibodies in breastmilk to pass more directly into baby's bloodstream, but it also means that large proteins from other foods (which may predispose baby to allergies) and disease-causing pathogens can pass right through, too. During baby's first 4-6 months, while the gut is still "open," antibodies (sIgA) from breastmilk coat baby's digestive tract and provide passive immunity, reducing the likelihood of illness and allergic reactions before gut closure occurs. Baby starts producing these antibodies on his own at around 6 months, and gut closure should have occurred by this time also. See How Breast Milk Protects Newborns and The Case for the Virgin Gut for more on this subject.<br>  <br>  # Delaying solids helps to protect baby from iron-deficiency anemia.<br>  The introduction of iron supplements and iron-fortified foods, particularly during the first six months, reduces the efficiency of baby's iron absorption. Healthy, full-term infants who are breastfed exclusively for periods of 6-9 months have been shown to maintain normal hemoglobin values and normal iron stores. In one study (Pisacane, 1995), the researchers concluded that babies who were exclusively breastfed for 7 months (and were not give iron supplements or iron-fortified cereals) had significantly higher hemoglobin levels at one year than breastfed babies who received solid foods earlier than seven months. The researchers found no cases of anemia within the first year in babies breastfed exclusively for seven months and concluded that breastfeeding exclusively for seven months reduces the risk of anemia. See Is Iron-Supplementation Necessary? for more information.<br>  <br>  # Delaying solids helps to protect baby from future obesity.<br>  The early introduction of solids is associated with increased body fat and weight in childhood. (for example, see Wilson 1998, von Kries 1999, Kalies 2005) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  What if my 4-5 month old seems developmentally ready for solids?<br>  <br>  Four- to five-month-old babies are sometimes very eager to participate at mealtime, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they are ready to eat solids - more often it's just the normal developmental urge to do what everyone else is doing. Research studies tell us that there are many health advantages to delaying solids for about 6 months for all babies, not just the babies who are not yet interested in mealtime.<br>  <br>  There are a number of things you can do to let baby participate in mealtimes without starting solids:<br>  <br>      * Let baby sit with the family at mealtime - in a lap, booster seat or high chair.<br>      * Give baby a cup of water or expressed milk. Your baby can entertain himself at mealtime while learning to use a cup. 1-3 ounces of water in the cup should be plenty (often for the entire day). Many moms choose to use only water or a small amount of breastmilk to avoid wasting the "liquid gold" while baby learns to use the cup.<br>      * Offer baby sips of water from your cup or straw. Even if baby hasn't figured out how to use a straw yet, you can put your straw in water, block the top end of the straw with your finger to trap a little water in the straw, then let baby drink the water from the lower end of the straw (unblock the top end once it's in baby's mouth).<br>      * Offer baby spoons, cups, bowls and other baby-safe eating utensils to play with during mealtime.<br>      * Give baby an ice cube (if it's a baby-safe size & shape) or ice chips to play with.<br>      * Offer baby a momsicle (popsicle made from breastmilk) or slushy frozen breastmilk to eat with a spoon.<br>  <br>  Myths about solids readiness<br>  <br>  There are many myths and outdated information regarding how to tell if baby is ready for solids.<br>  MYTH: Baby's weight has reached a "magic" number<br>  <br>  Just because your baby achieves "x" number of pounds, or has doubled birth weight, (or however much your baby weighs) does not mean that she is automatically ready for solids - particularly if she is under 6 months.<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics/World Health Organization recommendations for starting solids at 6 months or later has no exceptions for babies who weigh more. The research that I've seen on the health benefits of starting solids at 6 months and later holds for all babies, no matter what their weight.<br>  <br>  It's the maturity of the digestive tract and baby's developmental readiness that makes the difference, not baby's weight.<br>   <br>  <br>  It's rather interesting to note that moms are told to start solids for both big and small babies. It's not even uncommon to hear opposite arguments for both sides from the same person!<br>  MYTH: "Your baby is big so you need to start solids."<br>  <br>  Moms might be told to start solids for differing reasons when they have a large baby.<br>  <br>  Some are told that since baby is big, they won't be able to produce enough milk to satisfy baby. This is quite untrue - almost all mothers have the ability to produce enough milk to exclusively breastfeed twins and even triplets. If you allow your baby to nurse on cue, your body will make enough milk for your baby.<br>  <br>  Other moms are told that baby is eating too much, so mom should reduce baby's intake by limiting nursing and/or starting solids. There is absolutely NO evidence that a large breastfed baby will become a large child or adult, and limiting nursing can be quite dangerous for a baby. Read more here: Is my exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight?<br>   <br>  MYTH: "Your baby is small so you need to start solids."<br>  <br>  Another reason often given for starting solids is because baby is small (see Normal Growth of Breastfed Babies). I really don't see the sense in this. Ounce for ounce, breastmilk has more calories than most baby-safe solid foods and significantly more nutrients than any type of solid food that you can feed your baby. In addition, starting solids will quite possibly reduce the amount of milk that your baby is getting overall, rather than increase overall intake. One of the first recommendations for a baby who genuinely has slow weight gain is to decrease or eliminate solid foods and nurse more often. <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page..." rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...</a><br>  Take rice cereal, for example. Under conventional American wisdom, it's the best first food. But Butte says iron-rich meat — often one of the last foods American parents introduce — would be a better choice.<br>  <br>  Dr. David Ludwig of Children's Hospital Boston, a specialist in pediatric nutrition, says some studies suggest rice and other highly processed grain cereals actually could be among the worst foods for infants.<br>  <br>  "These foods are in a certain sense no different from adding sugar to formula. They digest very rapidly in the body into sugar, raising blood sugar and insulin levels" and could contribute to later health problems, including obesity, he says.<br>  <br>  The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou..." rel="nofollow">http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou...</a><br>  Finally, respect the tiny, still-developing digestive system of your infant.

PTdy6TWRaa	I suggest you don't try to curb his aggression by demonstrating how much more aggressive you can get with spankings, soap in the mouth, wooden spoons or any of the other tactics suggested to you for inflicting pain or humiliation. Those tactics may in fact be reinforcing and modeling the aggressive behavior that he's now showing.<br>  <br>  He might do well to spend time with a positive adult role model. Don't think of this as rewarding bad behavior but as a method to help bring out good behavior. He also may need more consistency from you and to be watched more closely so that things can be kept in check long before they spiral totally out of control.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	apply the hairbrush to his bare backside.|`|824cf20ac9afab200fa70ace25a4cc7daa	I work in a clinic.  Each community has community mental health clinics.  My advice is to give the nice people there a call.  Kids don't act out without reasons, it is time to find out what that reason is.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	A good spanking and yes, I am waiting for the low rating.<br>   I think its because parents don't spank their kids any more that kids is so out of hand. And i am not talking about beating a child.|`|bR8u9hpbaa	Figures the idiots you called would tell you exactly the wrong thing to do. What you need to do is take control of the situation, you can choose how you do that, but once the child knows who is the boss, and their antics will get them nowhere or get them more punishment, they will eventually come around. When I acted like your child I got my butt whipped, and then I was made to go to my room, no TV, no radio, and write 1000 times, I will not XXXX. Where XXX was what I did like sas my mom or slam a door. If I did multiple things, it was 1000 times for each offense. But above all, you must take control, and let him know who is in charge. What you've done so far is nowhere near enough, and is absolutely NOT too much or going to far. Maybe a nice open hand slap in the face when he's yelling at you that he hates you. Make it sting, he may not like it, but he'll start to respect you.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	They are right and wrong.  1) Kids lash out from stress and frustration if its just coping with every day life and changes of growing up/older or an environment such as other family in the house or who he's around with that is loud, obnoxious, tv shows that are bad, loud music, etc. 2) He's getting to the point where he is no longer a toddler, he should know better.  Slamming doors, etc is not proper behavior if he's mad or not and should not be acceptable 3) Taking away video games, etc. is a way of showing bad behavior as consequences.  Positive and praise is good because if they do a lot of bad things and you are obviously responding they will do that more as they would get more attention vs if he didnt do wrong and you dont pay attention in a way he thinks why did she notice.  You need to get help or find ways to let him release his frustration in a positive way.  Some examples could be to sign him up for softball or a sport.  When he gets mad or upset tell him how things arent always they way he likes and to handle them better and give examples of how he can handle it.  Have him count to 10-20 THEN act.  Be calm when talking to him.  Actions the parent do reflect on the child.  (Didnt you ever hear someone say the grandmother will laugh when their grandchild does something to you and they say see how it was for me with you....)|`|OMOuxROoaa	I seem to have the same problem when I get an answer i will let you know...lol...sorry it looks like you do the same things i do.

0ky4TktEaa	You've missed one of the times he's interested in learning. When he was sitting on the potty and trying to go, you should've been training him them. It's never too young to start; as long as they get on and show interest and can keep themselves dry for a couple hours at a time, train them. At this point, you need to decide what you want to do. Forcing a child who is not ready is just a waste of time and whole load of stress for the child and you. If you've missed the time (and you sound like you have), he is no longer ready. <br>  <br>  If he's keeping himself dry for a couple hours and letting you know when he needs to get changed, give it a try. MAKE him sit on it every hour on the hour. Eventually he will go in it; if he's holding out (and many kids will do that), learn his pottying schedule and stick him on the potty every hour at that time. He'll probably scream just like he's doing now and telling you "no"; do it anyway. He'll get over it when he figures out things go faster when he just sits down and tries. <br>  <br>  You may also want to go out and pick out some "big boy underwear" with his favorite character. Make a HUGE deal out of it and tell him he has to keep a dry pull up/diaper and go on the potty like a big boy. Continue sending him every hour on the hour. Once he begins keeping the pull up/diaper dry (with the exception of nap time/bed time), give it a go in the big boy underwear (i'd recommend with rubber pants so you don't get stuff everywhere if he has an accident). Let him know he has to poop in the potty if he wants to wear his underwear. For nap/bed times allow him to keep his underwear on but put a pull up/diaper underneath; designate this as his nap time/bed time pull up so he knows that it's only temporary. <br>  <br>  Children tend to get the hang of peeing but pooping doesn't usually come as easily. Once he gets the hang of peeing, do the same thing with pooping. Get him on the potty on his regular schedule. If you see him squatting or looking like he's trying to go, run and sit him on the potty. When he does go, make a HUGE deal; jump, sing, clap, dance etc. I caution against giving treats as many children begin to expect it and only cooperate if they get the treat. <br>  <br>  Once he get it a few times, get stricter about pooping in his underwear. Remind him every so often that poop goes in the potty and better not poop in his underwear. If after a month, this is going nowhere, stop for a couple of weeks, then try it again.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	I had that same problem. Tried and tried. Parents and angel all in tears. I stopped for 4 months. Trained in 2 days. Totally dry and clean within 2 day, day and night.|`|ai4lrclMaa	Put his diaper back on. he's telling you he's not ready yet. You can stress about it for months and he will still do it when he is good and bloody ready and not when you are.|`|a9btWYKRaa	My daughter was like that, I just stop pushing her to use the potty for a few weeks until I thought she was ready again.  Because she wasn't being forced to do it she was more interested in trying as she was in control.<br>  <br>  Give massive amounts of praise when successful as this will encourage them to use it more often. Also remember not to get angry when they have an accident, just explain that they are going to start wearing big girl/boy pants and they cannot wee or poo in them cos these ones don't just go in the bin.<br>  <br>  You could also make a sticker chart where they get a sticker for going on the potty/toilet, another one for washing their hands etc, It gives them great incentive to keep it up and continue going.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|KNxs4PrZaa	my reccomendation (and my doctors) is to let them be.  forcing potty training is useless, and will only make you and your child frusterated and upset.  he is 2.5 which is a normal age to start encouraging it, but its not late at all especially for a boy, my nephew is 3.5 and only just now really potty training.  follow his lead, if he wants to pee on the potty let him if he wants it to be a diaper day then fine, pressuring him will just be a set back. dont make weaing a diaper a bad thing, but make a big deal about big boy pants and when he goes pee in the potty.   trust me he wont go to kindergarden in a diaper, and forcing him before he is really ready is just going to drive you crazy. relax and give him some space.|`|qiUo1CTYaa	In my experience it is really best not to push the issue.  Trying to start toilet training before a child is ready usually just draws the experience out longer and makes it more stressful and traumatic for everyone.  Give it a break for a few weeks and slowly test the waters again.  You can't force a kid to use the toilet no matter how much you want to!  In the mean time, you could read some books with him or watch some movies about going to the toilet, just to keep the idea fresh in his mind.  There is a really cute 'Bear in the Big Blue House' DVD called "Potty Time With Bear"  and a whole host of kids books about going to the potty.  Then when your ready to try again, begin by just trying to put him on the potty when you change his nappy, make it part of the nappy change routine.  Once you start having some successes at these times you can try again with the underwear and try to make it a more frequent thing.  Good luck with it, but the best advice is really to let your son guide the process!|`|bHWr0kisaa	Every time he says "NO" tell him to get on the pot and when he gets on the pot give him a coloring book and some crayons.Or you can read a  book to him.Just make sure you keep him entertained.|`|IHZOoe9qaa	BE PATIENT .AS YOU KNOW THIS TO WILL PASS|`|9KrSwJbEaa	my son does the same thing maybe he's not ready.

LZ3BwE0baa	to be completely honest you are about at the time of the month when you would be ovulating so i would say its impossible these symptoms are because you are pregnant.....<br>  unless youtr bleed last month was different (lighter/shorter) then take a test you could have conceived last month but this month....so soon after your bleed...i dont think so sweety <br>  <br>  all the best <br>  xxx|`|b8f0CfSsaa	The symptoms you are experiencing are common in early pregnancy, but they only happen when you have ovulated, your egg has been fertilised and it has then attached to the wall of your uterus. It is far too soon for all of this to have happened.<br>  <br>  What you are experiencing may be new signs of ovulation. You typically ovulate 14 days after the first day of your period. (go to www.babycentre.co.uk to use an ovulation calendar if you haven't already). If you succesfully fall pregnant your egg will take 3-7 days to travel through your fallopian tubes and then a further 3-7 days to attach, so it could take a whole 14 days for you to experience early pregnancy symptoms!<br>  <br>  Good luck with TTC!|`|3mc7hEjraa	congradulations it sounds like you pregnant|`|KgD3VhKYaa	you really need to take a test! no one can actually tell you.<br>  <br>  Fingers crossed x x x|`|1u4CS5J3aa	you could be id run out and take a test you are beyond late so you should have an accurate result.

kiAQi91laa	I do know that there is a good chance babies can live outside of the womb at 24 weeks.  Anything under 20 weeks the baby has even a less chance to survive being born too early.  I know this baby means everything to you and your wife and I would talk to your wife to see if she's will to be at bed rest until the baby's birth.  If you both decide to wait it out as much as possible see if your insurance can cover her to stay in the hospital until the birth.  If not, see if you can hire a personal nurse to be in your house or a dedicated family member to stay with your wife.  She shouldn't walk at all if it's possible and may have to use a bed pan, but you need to realize is it worth it?  I personally think it is and I was told by my doctor that my pregnancy would end in a miscarriage by 50%.
AwSfJhZCaa	I agree with Ryan R you need to talk to him about his behavior.

Try to find fun creative things for him to do around where you now live and hopefully he'll make new friends and not be so miserable missing his old ones.|`|dbCkTKDxaa	talk to him and ask what is brothering him because kid only do that when there is something really wrong at home or school.|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	You need to get to the bottom of his anger. Maybe establishing his position in a foreign land. What do the people in the country feel about where he comes from????|`|CrZxYK5raa	it might be that he thinks he has a lot of "power" at home.<br>  you need to strip all power from him. take away everything <br>  and make sure he is not bullying his younger siblings. <br>  talk to him and find out what is going on he might need a counselor.<br>  be a good parent and discipline, listen,and  love.|`|Nh2FhVZXaa	try teasing him like he does maybe he may feel angry or ashamed(if embarrasing) and stop but please give him the message easily if that does not work give him a little punishment show him that things wont always be his control|`|vNWYbte2aa	be parent and spank the little b*st*rd!!!!!!|`|ESddOs2caa	Show Authority.

4SDqRs6Laa	I was in the same situation although I'm a little older than you. My boyfriend was thrilled and I was happy but terrified. You both have full time jobs though and I don't. We don't have our own home either...<br>  <br>  My pregnancy was like an outer body experience. It was so surreal (both in a good and not so good way). When my baby was born (last December 2008) I didn't feel like I was her mom... I felt responsible for her and I did everything a mom needed to do, but it was as if I was taking care of someone elses baby... It was really weird and really sad... I did everything I had to do and still I felt like a bad mom...FEELING I'm a mom is only kinda starting now and she's almost 3 months...<br>  <br>  I have a feeling though once you start feeling your baby flutter in your tummy or do a 3d4d ultrasound and see your baby move you are going to cry happy tears and you will start getting excited to find out what the gender is, what the baby will look like and hundreds of other questions... You have a supportive man by your side, so everything is going to be alright :)|`|ChsvVm60aa	yes everyday i questioned what i was doing and had the proud boyfriend bragging to everyone when i was so confused ....<br>  but just wait until you get your ultra sound things would have settle in and you will get to see you bub.... you will be so excited , buying baby clothes ect..you are scared ,yes its going to change your life and yes sounds like your going to be a good mother and have a good man.. dont stress enjoy your pregnancy its a wonderful thing.... best wishes to you and your new family..|`|BO28Mn8haa	i'm 20 and I thought I was pregnant, but my boyfriend was less than thrilled. He is pretty much my husband as we live together and have full time jobs as you do, except he is currently working on his masters and me on my bachelors, so as you can imagine it isn't convenient to get pregnant right now. turns out i wasn't, and we both ended up a little disappointed. my situation doesn't relate too much, but i'm a really good listener and give pretty good advice if you'd like to talk :). fxyroxy777@hotmail.com-- windows live messenger|`|xhOulzZ7aa	Don't stress you may not feel like a mother until you are holding your little baby, then I'm sure that it will all come naturally after that.

Best of luck with it all.|`|dXAgTUSraa	Well if your boyfriend is excited and thrilled, then you should be extremely happy.

You can probably also find a pre-natal class for women your age which will also help you and your bf.|`|7QxMGgILaa	Hey - congrats.  You are in a great position - especially having a bf that is also in for it.  I had my first at 17, so was young, but have coped well (I have had another 2 since) I am now 22.  I love my kids they bring so much joy and happiness.  You will be a great mommy.  Remember there is no manual on how to be a mom.  Do what works best for you.  If you wanna chat, just e-mail me.  I'll always reply.
KOwzDLPdaa	If you didn't ejaculate in her and she took Plan B then the chances are slim. <br>  <br>  You already know to always use protection, now you just have to remember!<br>  <br>  And it is very refreshing to answer this question for a 19 year old having sex for the first time then a 13 year old. Kudos to both of you for being a mature age!<br>  <br>  :)|`|dXAgTUSraa	wait until its time for her next period and if she has period have her make appt with ob/gyn and get and iud called mirena it is birth control for 5 years, its awesome. If she is then just take it one day at a time. It will all be ok. Hope this helps.|`|BO28Mn8haa	i HIGHLY doubt she is pregnant. like .001% that she is. don't worry about it|`|AA11066099	We are not clairvoyants.x|`|4SDqRs6Laa	Well it doesn't matter how many times either of you have had sex or when her period was, precum is indeed not safe and neither is playing roulette. If she took Plan B however, I wouldn't worry. Don't stress her out too much either, it could prolong her next period from starting. Chances are very slim that she is pregnant, so let this be a serious warning.|`|XHzSkdTiaa	The odds of her being pregnant are very slim, so try not to worry about it too much. Trust me, I totally understand your concern (seriously I'm not just saying that), but you can't go back in time and change things now. <br>  Just remember, no birth control is 100% so there is always a chance of pregnancy when you have sex.|`|xhOulzZ7aa	Sounds like you have had a good wake up call, and you know the dangers. Fingers crossed for crossed for you, I hope all goes well. Just learn from this and be more careful hey? Best of luck|`|XgaF1Q64aa	How do you know she wasn't 13??? huh?? huh??|`|GqDmkAl3aa	Plan B is most effective if taken in the first 24 hrs but does work up to 3 days after unprotected sex with the chance of it working slimming by the day BUT its still effective, because this was your first time the chances of you mistakenly cumming inside of her (precum) are greatly increased because you are very aroused. As for when her period was its different for all woman when they ovulate. Some woman ovulate while on the rag and other ovulate days before or days after, thats not an answer that someone can give you online. The risks of being pregnant after the Plan B pills are very slim so I would say its about a 1/10 chance. I understand you worry but you will be fine. She may start feeling sick b/c of the pills and may even bleed from them as well this is all normal. Just make sure you wrap it from now on. Take care and God Bless.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Nothing is fool proof. <br>  <br>  Now you wait and see.|`|XSP24wJ7aa	If you did not ejaculate up her and she took the pill then she has just has much chance of becoming pregnant as she would of done if you wore a condom. I wouldn't worry.<br>  <br>  Just use this as a lesson as to always wear a condom in future..
r7q8LW7Aaa	Learn what about music?<br>  I mean, they can start listening from before birth - some instruments can be taught earlier than others - I'm sure they'll be much older to learn how to write music.<br>  Your question is too vague.|`|rH31CwjMaa	any age as long as they keen to learn|`|SRDPnnIMaa	umm i think some children can learn as early as 3 years of age|`|08965f2b98bcd6a91a1ca8d6f7fc5944aa	It depends what you mean by "learn music", and it depends on the child. Even a tiny baby can enjoy listening to music, making noises, and playing with musical toys. The earlier you start them with things like this the better, do everything you can to expose them to music and to the opportunity to make interesting noises! As for more formal learning, it really depends on the ability level & interest of the child. If they seem really keen, are able to pay attention long enough, and have the motor co-ordination to play an instrument, I'd say they're ready to start learning the more formal skills of making music, but this has to be done in an age-appropriate way - clearly a 3 year old is unlikely to be able to read music or sit through formal lessons, no matter what their level of ability and enthusiasm! By the age of about 6, they might be ready to start "proper" lessons, but again, it depends on the child. My 8 year old enjoys messing about with musical instruments, and he loves making funny noises (he's actually getting to be a bit of a little beatboxer!!), but he doesn't have the patience & attention span to sit down and formally learn an instrument - I know it would be a waste of time & money, and he'd probably resent it. On the other hand, my 6 year old daughter recently asked if she could have piano lessons, which I plan on sending her to after our upcoming move to a bigger house when we'll finally have room for my parents' old piano. She has a lot more patience, responds really we'll to the kind of one-on-one attention that is involved in music lessons, and enjoys trying to do well.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are a musical person yourself; if so, you are in a great position to introduce them to music. Kids like to copy the grownups around them, and teaching them new skills can be a valuable opportunity to spend "quality" time with them. Just sitting down and showing them how to play a simple tune is very rewarding for them. They'll probably be happy at first with only knowing one or two tunes (which they might then bore you to death with!), so don't overwhelm them with too much information. Let them progress at their own pace and they'll be much happier.<br>  <br>  One big word of warning - don't pressurise children into learning a musical instrument if they don't want to (or even if they do want to, don't put too much pressure on), it can totally destroy their interest and put them off the idea of learning music altogether. My parents made this mistake with me - I was made to go to piano lessons for 5 or 6 years, and I hated it. I lost all interest in making music until I was a teenager and decided I wanted to play the guitar; I started teaching myself and was doing OK, but the minute I started formal lessons my previous experience with the piano made me resistant to practising and I didn't make much progress. I regret this so much now as an adult, and have tried my best not to do the same with my kids. Music shouldn't feel like a chore, it should be fun and relaxed. As parents it's natural to want the best for your kids and for them to have a better start than you did, but we can't mould them into the person we wish we had turned out to be (or into mini clones of ourselves) against their will!!|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	Most child prodigies start learning at about age 3.<br>  <br>  .|`|huWSAcT4aa	about 4 or 5|`|S526wwgJaa	That depends on what instrument and what child.

NEWbh3Plaa	While he is at school, take everything out of his room except his bed and dresser.  When he comes home tell him some things have changed.  When he can start showing you that he respects you and your home then he can start having some things back.  Stick to it.  Send him to room after school and then only let him out for supper.  If you have to, bring a chair in the hall way and sit in it so he can't keep coming out.  If that doesn't work...beat his a*s.  I don't think beating kids is right, but I got my butt smacked growing up and I turned out just fine.  Sometimes that is all it takes.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Sounds like he needs something to do.

Try putting in a storage unit or locked room that only unlocks wtih the key. Get a deadbolt for his door that unlocks from the outside, since he comes out if it is not locked. He earns his things back when he shows respect. He can earn up to one thing back a week if he shows respect to all people and everything in your house. He is disrespectful one time he has lost the chance for an item back that week. He eats three meals a day( fix meals that you would normally fix, not Peanut butter and Jelly.) and goes to school does his homework and showers. Otherwise he is in his room (with it locked from outside). If he destroys his mattress, he sleeps on the floor. He destroys his blanket, he goes cold. He destroys his clothes, he can go Naked. He earns Furniture and more clothes first, and works his way up to the fun stuff. He does not go to a friends house or anywhere fun until he earns all his stuff and privileges back ( privileges come last) he is disrepectful once, everything goes back and he gets nothing else to do.

When we met the kids didn't mesh well. We both had different discipline styles. Not long later, my fiance was on page with my discipline tactic! I believe in a militaristic upbringing, I am the boss and everybody knows it. It is yes ma'am no ma'am, and for punishment they have to do push ups, where they go down and hold the position and come back up and hold it, for five minutes. If they don't go to bed and try to stay awake at night, then they are told to get dressed for the weather, and go outside and run laps around the house 6 times. If they aren't tired then I will make them tired. They all listen very well, and have respect for all adults. They even point out other kids who are behaving poorly, and ask why there parents don't stop them from being bad! My sister has many problems with her kids, but they listen well to me. Any kid in my house eats whatever is put in front of them with no complaints, and if they don't eat it is goes into the refrigerator until the next meal for them to eat again. If they break a toy, they will not get another one. They have never damaged anything of mine, not even by accident! I have taken their bed from them when the room is not cleaned to standards. They have had to pack up all their toys and put it in a bag to be given to goodwill, and that is for back talking. Maybe you should try to be very strict. You don't have to beat him to get through, but you don't have to be his friend. Make his life a living hell, and tell him if you want to mess with my property and disrepect me I will do the same back. Dress him in goodwill clothes, and show him the value of a dollar. Make him work in the yard. At first it might seem like a lot of work on your part, but it will rewarding in the end.|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	Yea! You can take him to church, just don't leave him alone with the pastor. Sounds like your traditional yuppie politically correct 2009 punishments just don't cut it. He can do anything he wants because he likes peanut butter and jelly, debating and pushing you around and your buttons at will. You are sinking to his level and using all your time and energy arguing with a 10 year old child. Now we have one tall and one short 10 year old kids debating with one another. You are the parent. You have to mean business when it comes to rewards and discipline. Let him know you love him just as much as you need to let him know his *** in a jam if he gets out of line. STOP DEBATING STOP ARGUING STOP PLEADING STOP LETTING HIM RUN THE SHOW. Kids have a very short attention span. They also don't understand as you, the damages they may create as a result to their young minds. However writing on the walls at his age his clearly a response to your lack of discipline. I, can almost bet you cleaned the walls because he refused to. Provided you even asked him to. Follow through. You are letting him off the hook because it is easier for you, then making him be accountable for his actions. Take everything away from him, out of his room and lock it up. As he improves in his attitude return one item at a time. When he reverts back, take it back. Don't argue. Just do it. If he wants to raise perfect hell, let him. When he is all done take something else. Praise him for his accomplishments. Where is dad??? Sounds like dads not around to spend quality and constructive time with him. The kid is 10 years old. He needs to be camping, hiking,riding his bike,playing with friends,fishing,and burning up some of his energy at the community pool. Get him out of the house and off the frustrating computer games. Turn off the TV and start doing something constructive with him. Another words, keep him busy.|`|TQ47vny4aa	Where is the father at.

"Catch" him being good (this sounds hard, i know). In that minute second that he is not mouthing off/ damaging/ yelling/ so on... praise him generously. Give him a token for that. Kids this age love it! I bought a large can of styrofoam shapes at walmart in the craft section to use as tokens. Then I bought small candies and dollar items from the dollar tree and put them in a box. Then he could trade his tokens for rewards. He was so happy with the constant praise from me that he strived to behave. It was slow at first, but keep at it.|`|n7KvCEMaaa	Only letting him have PB&J to eat is the wrong thing to do.  Maybe the child acts out because he feels left out.  I have no idea what your home life is like but making him feel like an outcast is not going to solve any of your problems.  Sit down and have a serious discussion with him if it gets you nowhere than try taking him to see a soccer game or see if he would like to sign up for some sports but explain no him that he has to have respect for things to get things and if he doesn't show any respect then take him off of his sports and strip his room to the bare necessities.  That means taking off the door.

159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	chill your not pregnant.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi i had mine back 6 weeks after my second. maybe your body is just taking its time. if you started any contraceptive pills recently or in the last couple of months then you wont get one for a couple months. if not and you dont get it next month you should see your gp.|`|gdnL63ngaa	Maybe it takes longer. Maybe you're still producing milk?<br>  But at the same time, enjoy it :)
1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	I don't want to sound ugly....but OVER-reacting would've been taking him to the ER Saturday, after he threw up the first time.  It's been 4 days honey.  I'd say that after four days, that'd be called UNDER-reacting!!!  <br>  <br>  Since it's still a weekday, I would call the doctor's office and not go to the ER.  It could be from the shot, but I doubt it.  Not after this length of time.  But going to the doctor's office would be much cheaper than a visit to the ER and it would be a much less traumatizing experience for your son.  He definitely needs to be seen.|`|nE47Giwbaa	You need to take that child to the Doctor. It could be that he is suffering from an allergic reaction to the shot, or any myriad of things. Dehydration can happen very fast and once that happened your child might find himself in a worse situation. It can lead to high fever, loss of consciousness and even death. Take him to the E.R. right away and do not delay.|`|zOUEE48haa	i think the question is has he had any high fever??anyhow call your pediatrician he knows best for your son maybe he got a bad reaction because of the shot.keep him very hydrated give him lots and lots liquids like water.Even tough he doesnt want to eat or drink always keep trying!!!<br>  also check if he pees regularly if he is peeing normally than hes not dehydrated.make sure he always have liquids<br>  <br>  but i think you should first ask your ped for any medications now if he has a very high fever, and nonstop vomiting i think yes take him to th e.r.|`|AA12366897	I don't know if it's about the shot he got, but I think you should bring him to the doctor.  He might be dehydrated.  Does he seem very listless?  Does he seem to be in pain? Does he have a fever?|`|d304540c53bb1ee7a9ad670a4d0574e8aa	you need to take him immediately, he could get dehydrated then you are going to have all kinds of probs
e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	hi hun x i know how you feel, since my son has turned 3 he won't do a thing i say. then i took him to taekwando (think thats how its spelt)- what a life saver!!!!!! he loves it and it teaches him discipline and respect. have you tried martial arts for him? some places take them from their 3. good luck x|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Walk off and leave him there. When he realises you aren't paying attention to him, he will stop doing it (obviously don't go too far, just far enough so he is still safe but realises you aren't falling for his tantrum anymore).|`|ybdNwzMBaa	If you keep trying to talk to him then thats just what he wants (Attention) so walk away and don't look back,you willlosee out.|`|a9btWYKRaa	Don't give up and never let him see that he is getting to you!<br>  <br>  Just try and make it interesting for him by playing games and teaching him things on the way.  My daughter hated walking but then I started to play games along the way and she loves it, It takes her mind off how far she is walking too so sometimes she can walk quite far without complaining once.<br>  <br>  If he complains he is tired say to him "we will stop for a minute so you can rest but then we must carry on walking again", (Obviously do not let this happen every few steps as he will just use it as an excuse all the time) Also always praise him when he is doing well, my little girl loves to hear how good she is at walking and paying attention to road safety.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0ky4TktEaa	How old is he. If he's 2+, a good swat is in line. If he's under 2, put him in a stroller. It sounds like he's old enough to know that it irritates you when he laughs when you tell him to do something. If he's old enough put him in time out, followed by a swat every time it doesn't work. If he's still really little, don't worry about it just yet.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	please provide his age. his age will determine how people will approach this.|`|IYiZgev1aa	With the laughing, take something treasured away until he respects you. Also, when he sits on the floor while you're shopping, just walk off a bit looking back at him, to see if he follows you. If that doesn't work, give him a goal to get to. So if he's good he'll get a treat. I have an 11 year old boy who was the same, and this worked with  him and he also laughs a lot. Hope this helps.|`|idFvwX9zaa	you need to give a bit more detail to your question. How old is he? What is it you have actually tried when you say "you've tried everything"??
xnhwmontaa	He waited after he got soft a lil before he pulled out huh? lol My husband did that once. the *** ended up getting all over the bed. Was is it ALL the way inside you? was it hanging out at all? Taking Plan B I think should work. My friend had a miscarriage then like 2 yrs later she took plan b it worked for it. but it shouldnt matter, miscarriage has nothing to do with it
90zcKChJaa	As you near the end of your pregnancy, your cervix will begin to thin out and dilate. As it changes, you may lose your mucus plug and find a gooey deposit in your underwear or on the toilet tissue after wiping. It is not uncommon for this mucus to be mixed with brown, pink, or red streaks of blood from the changes occurring within your cervix. Some women may lose the plug at 36 weeks' gestation, while many others may not lose it until labor has begun. Sometimes moms-to-be may not even notice that they are losing their mucus plug because it happens gradually, over several weeks, and they've already grown accustomed to varying but increased amounts of the vaginal discharge that often accompanies a normal pregnancy.|`|hBBQZ6yDaa	Before the baby is ready to come out, women 1st loose their "mucus plug" that's the mucus stuff that's on the cervical opening. 1st the plug comes out, then the water may break, and here comes the baby!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	The mucus plug is an accumulation of secretions that form within the opening to the uterus, also called the cervical canal. The fact that mucus accumulates early in pregnancy is quite beneficial, as it serves to create a protective barrier against infection between the outside world and your growing baby.<br>  <br>  As you near the end of your pregnancy, your cervix will begin to thin out and dilate.

6akCILTQaa	wait for few more days, if still persists, go to a doctor|`|hswTS1jVaa	It could be but the only way to know for sure is to take a test.  If you miss your period today, take one tomorrow morning with the first urine of the day.|`|p3d3E75oaa	just take a test it should show up by now|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	A lot of those symptoms are similar to what I had when I got pregnant with my son.

Y4s4Om38aa	Discuss it with your OB.   If you have been heathy and havent been high risk other then the fact that you are carrying twins, then you may be ok.  However even if the OB gives the OK on it i would at least look into what hospitals would be availible to you down there and how far they are and everything, just so you do know if anything comes up.  Twins coming very early isnt uncommon.|`|9qTY9kP2aa	As long as you are healthy and having a safe pregnancy so far it will probably be fine. If you are having twins though they may consider that high risk and change the "ok to fly" time. Like for single birth 35 weeks is the cut-off to fly/travel I believe. If this is your first "babies" you are going to want this vacation with your hubby!!! Hope everything works out for you!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	I would ask your ob as you stated. I would say ok, but twins (never had any) so, I would ask him/her.
7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	You are not a bad person, but this is her child and you should mind your own business. That is what she will tell you herself if you get too deep into it. <br>  <br>  Please don't even mention the word adoption to her. There are too many unwanted children out there that those "loving couples" could adopt but refuse to. )Adoption from foster care has hundreds of thousands of kids that actually need homes, but there are 80 "loving couples" waiting in line for a fresh white and healthy baby and are willing to pay $30,000 for it for make believe fees. Those fees are different for different races of children. Why is that huh? Foster care adoption is free!) Don't push any more rainbows and sunshine propaganda out there so some "loving couple" can Buy her kid. Adoption is no guarantee of a better life. It is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. You say yourself that you "had" it tough, but now things are better with you child right? Would you have given him or her away? Besides, open adoption is not enforceable even if there is a signed contract. <br>  <br>  now if you are talking about trying to talk her into an abortion, then she will make that decision not you. <br>  <br>  A baby can be the best thing that happens to her so that he can get her life back on track. The father saying he will stick around is not wrong. It means he will not run out on his child, even if they break up. You do not have to be together to be a good parent. There are so many great resources out there she can take advantage of to help parent her kid including college tuition, WIC, food stamps, job training, and day care vouchers. (If you were to get licensed by the state to watch her kid, she could  give those vouchers to you and the state will give you the classes for free) And if they are not going to get married, child support. There are still resources out there for you if you are still having a hard time including those vouchers for yourself if staying at home with kids is not your thing. You can still get WIC for another year too.|`|JWYs2pBgaa	maybe her party animal days are over and she's ready to settle, it does happen.. blimey i couldn't have been any more of a party animal if i tried, now i'm a quiet do nothing mother of an 8 year old and yes it's not always been easy, far from in in fact but as you must know yourself there's nothing as rewarding or fulfilling as being a parent... it's her life it's her choices you can't live it for her, all you can do is be there for support as and when she needs, if you talk her out of it, you'll have that on your concience for the rest of your days... be a good sister, be a support, let her know that it's not all good but that you're around for advice for when those times happen, your experience will be invaluable.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	She is your sister so you should be there for her and support her, but this is her decision to make.

And don't regrest it at all. You should support her decision and not try to make her feel any worse or make her feel its wrong becuz if she has an abortion you will really feel like ish becuz when time passes all she will remember is my sister didn't think I could be a good mother.

I know sometimes it seems like peoples situation isnt right but you have to leave it up to her. I mean you could talk to her and kind of hint at her all the things you know are difficult about motherhood but i wouldnt blurt it all out. You dont know how she feels about this and if she wants it you have to be sensitive to that, if not she is liable to push away. <br>  <br>  Plus, you never know if she is truly ready for this change. Sometimes people have kids and keep there bad habits but others have children and change.... My best friend was a crazy party girl for years... and when she got pregnant she completely changed, overnight. It was like a switch.

Even party animals make good mums, and its her choice whether or not shes ready to be a mother, and she will probably need your advice and support :). No man that I have ever met felt 'ready' to be a dad but they won't use condoms will they! Just love her and offer her your support, that's what she needs. xx|`|ESAM0U7xaa	i know how u feel. i was mad at my cousin when she got pregnant even though she was married. she was only 21, hadn't been to college and has a pacemaker...so those were the 3 things i was concerned about. i just wanted her to fulfill all her dreams first before a family. she also got married on a whim and i thought she was rushing to quickly. <br>  but i finally had to step back and let her do her own thing. she's like my sister and i love her...the best you can do it offer support and not the negative stuff because it will only push them away!<br>  <br>  the right thing to do would be for her to keep the baby and grow up. have a nice sit down chat with her...tell her the party days are over and she needs to be responsible for the baby. go to an ultrasound with her. maybe when she hears the heartbeat and sees the baby it will all kick in for her.<br>  I hope she's not too young and unprepared for this!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! it will work out.......|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Your not a bad person and it is natural to be concerned.

I feel for the child. wow.|`|koAaPXKQaa	I think you should talk to her about it and just make sure that she is ready. I certainly don't think you should be trying to talk her out of it though because it's not your decision to make. Just speak to her though and make sure she is fully prepared.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I must ask this because so many people have said it's a bad idea, but why can't termination be discussed?? It is an option and not one that a person has to feel guilty about.

VKgD1K3baa	I am unsure of the side effects, but have always heard to give breast milk or formula until AT LEAST year. You should give your pediatrician a call.|`|Xc02z608aa	As a replacement for formula, no.  For a little drink now and then, yes.<br>  <br>  If she is already on a cows milk based formula it won't do her any harm.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	You are going to get more mixed answers that are only going to confuse you more by asking this question on here, everyone has very different beliefs on this matter. It is best to consult your physician for their advice on this one. My children's physician told me to start mixing whole milk with their formula at 9 months and continue slowly until they were off formula completely by 12 months. This also means the solid food intake needed to be increased so they were getting all the nutrients they were not getting from the formula.|`|nqHSQpqZaa	Well, I can't tell you from experience because my first baby is only 3 months old but I have heard 1 year is the time you can start cow's milk. But then again 4-6 months is the age you start solids and I started my son on cereal yesterday and he is doing really well. Some babies are ready earlier than others. I think the concern with cow's milk is some of the enzymes are hard to break down, but if you're wanting to give your daughter milk that's not formula and has nutritional value why don't you try soy milk? It tastes really good to them, and is nutritious and my 9 month old nephew drinks it everyday. I wouldn't however replace formula with it if your daughter is still formula fed. Just do what you think is best. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to tell if you give her cow's milk and she has a bad reaction to it, it's just a matter of if you really want to take that chance or not.|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	Way back when that's all kids had was cows milk. Look around, there are millions of people still living. Cows milk has sugar and may be harder to digest. Formula has additives which doctors claim are better for the baby and their digestive system. You can start adding small amounts of milk to the formula and eventually wing the baby off expensive formulas if you so choose. Ask your doctor. With the new health care plan the Government will be implementing. You will be required to give your child only one type of formula. If you are caught giving the child something else. Your insurance will be voided and charges brought against you for child abuse. Good luck.|`|1pbWoSZ2aa	i would ask your health visitor about this BUT as far as i am aware and how i gave my daughter milk, i started giving her cows milk in her cereal from 9 months but no other sort of cows milk until she was about 18 months old although you can give them it from 1yr+. They can only have full fat milk until they are 2 or older. Also giving them milk too early can give them allergies so i would stear clear for as long as you can. please take my advice with a pich of salt as i am only going by my own exeriences!|`|PvwA2SSCaa	I was watching the mom show and this question came up. Dr. Dave said to wait until the baby is at least 1 year of age because there is a possibility of the child ending up with diabetes.
uWUln8fpaa	If you don't control your sugar you may have a big baby. Also when your sugar goes up the baby's goes up so it produces more insulin to lower their sugar so when it is born it could have very low blood sugar and end up in the NICU. I had gestational diabetes with my middle child and she weighed 10 lb. I had to have a c-section. Then her blood sugar was extremely low so she had to spend 3 days in the NICU. She was the biggest baby in there. Most baby's in the NICU are preemies, so they are tiny. Just check your sugar often and get the shots if you need them. I tried to control mine with diet alone but I didn't do a very good job. Good luck and take care of yourself and your baby.|`|8RfmosODaa	You just need to watch what you eat, making sure you keep your sugar down.
4SDqRs6Laa	OMG my daughter is exactly the same way! From 15-30 minutes down to 10, sometimes less than 5 mintues!<br>  <br>  She's 10 weeks now and started doing that last week. I was wondering about it, because sometimes she's not hungry for 4-5 hrs after a 5 minute feeding. She seems content after feedings, is gaining weight and fills up her diapers enough though so I'll just have to trust her on that.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	She's definitely not weaning herself at such a young age. It's normal. She's become better at getting what she wants in a shorter amount of time. My daughter is seven months, she nurses for around 5 minutes every 2 hours. All totally normal. Even if she starts nursing for longer period of time, more often, less often, ect ect...it's all pretty normal. As long as she's having wet/dirty diapers, you can be assured she's eating enough.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	My daughter is a quick nurser too but not that quick.  If she pops off after that first 5 minutes try to burp her, change positions and offer her the same breast again. How long has she been doing this?|`|MeYILJeSaa	I highly doubt she's weaning herself. I was concerned too when my son became a quick nurser, but the lactation consultant told me it;s completely normal. All babies are different, consider yourself lucky that she gets right down to business! Before I had my baby, my mom was telling me about how my brother would nurse for  an hour every 2 hours. Needless to say, I was relieved when my son decided he just wanted to eat. Period. :)<br>  <br>  I just want to add that if she's seems happy, she is getting full. She would be screaming if she were hungry.|`|DKfScL8taa	It depends on how much milk is in your boobs. At one point my son would just nurse and gulp for 5 minutes straight. I could tell by how much smaller my boobs were afterwards, plus she's getting better at it. My son nursed every 2 hours. If she starts eating less or less often I would talk to my doctor about it.|`|rjVALevtaa	If she's still wetting diapers and having bowel movements on a regular basis then she's probably getting enough. Some babies are just more efficient at nursing than others.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yeah at 8 weeks your baby says "Screw this, I'll starve to death".<br>  <br>  Either she is getting enough (and that should be pretty obvious), or you aren't nursing often enough and your supply is dropping and she is in trouble (which should also be obvious).  <br>  <br>  But 8 week olds do not wean.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#breastfeedingpatterns" rel="nofollow">http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#br...</a><br>  Some mothers become concerned if baby begins to nurse in very short sessions. Most breastfeeding experts advise that if the baby continues to have plenty of wet diapers, regular bowel movements, is gaining weight well and meeting developmental milestones, then baby is getting enough breastmilk. Even sessions as short as five minutes can be normal, as long as baby continues to grow and do well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/babyselfwean.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/babys...</a><br>  Introduction<br>  <br>  True SELF-weaning before a baby is a year old is very uncommon. In fact, it is unusual for a baby to wean before 18-24 months unless mom is encouraging weaning. However, it is very common to hear a mother say that her baby self-weaned at 9 or 10 months old, or even earlier. How do we reconcile these statements?<br>   <br>  What is self-weaning?<br>  <br>  A baby who is weaning on his own:<br>  <br>      * is typically well over a year old (more commonly over 2 years)<br>      * is at the point where he gets most of his nutrition from solids<br>      * drinks well from a cup<br>      * cuts down on nursing gradually<br>  <br>  Child-led weaning occurs when a child no longer has a need to nurse - nutritionally or emotionally. The solids part should rule out self-weaning in babies under a year since, for optimum health and brain development, babies under a year should be getting most of their nutrition from breastmilk.<br>  <br>   <br>  What factors might lead mom to think that her baby is self-weaning?<br>  <br>  When a mother says that her baby self-weaned before a year, there is a chance that she interpreted a normal developmental stage (perhaps combined with her own wishes) as baby's wish to wean. Low milk supply can also play a part.<br>  Low milk supply<br>  <br>  If mom's milk supply is reduced, baby may become less interested in nursing, and of course decreased nursing will lead to an even lower milk supply. If milk supply is low, baby may grow to prefer a cup or bottle simply because he can get more milk this way. As long as baby is nursing on cue and removing milk thoroughly, mom's breasts will produce the milk that baby needs. There are a number of things that might interfere with the milk production process after lactation has been established. Some factors that commonly come into play in baby's second six months include:<br>  <br>      * Scheduled feedings or other things that reduce baby's nursing frequency too much (for example, pacifier overuse or sleep training). The answer to "how much is too much?" will depend on the particular mother-baby pair. A consistent decrease in nursing frequency will signal your body to decrease milk supply.<br>      * Rapid weight loss. A sudden decrease in mom's calorie intake can result in decreased milk supply.<br>      * Medications or herbs that reduce milk supply (hormonal contraceptives, for example).<br>      * Early introduction of solids (before 6 months). Besides interfering with baby's immunologic health, solids before six months often results in baby taking less milk at the breast and thus results in a decrease in milk supply.<br>      * Overly rapid increase in the amounts of solids. Again, this results in baby taking too little milk at the breast and thus a decreased milk supply. Keep in mind that mom's milk supply will naturally and gradually decrease as baby begins to eat greater quantities of solid foods - this is fine and expected. What you want to avoid is increasing solids/decreasing milk supply too quickly, as breastmilk is what baby needs for proper growth, health and brain development through the first year and beyond.<br>  <br>  For more on milk supply, including how to increase it, see Got Milk?<br>  Normal developmental stages<br>  <br>  It is common and normal for babies to show less interest in breastfeeding sometime during the second six months. This is developmental and not an indication that baby wishes to stop nursing.<br>  <br>  Older babies tend to be distractible and want to be a part of all the action around them. Your baby may be more interested in learning about the world than in eating during the day (these same babies often increase their night nursing to make up for their busy days).<br>  If baby is being given a bottle or sippy cup frequently, he discovers that he can walk/crawl around with it and not miss a thing, whereas nursing generally requires sitting still and not looking around for a few minutes. For this reason, some babies develop a preference for the bottle or cup at this developmental stage.<br>  <br>  Milestone times, such as crawling and walking, and stressful times like teething or illness can also cause baby to be less interested in nursing - these types of things are common in the second six months.

A few seconds will eventually turn into a few minutes.  He will get better.      My son also cried everytime, but I kept doing it and now he can do tummy time for 10 minutes - and enjoys it.|`|8mLJJVGhaa	None of my children had set belly times, and they are all ok.  My youngest is 9 months now, and has only just started to enjoy time on her belly, only for about 10 minutes at a time though, and with lots of toys!  If your son is being upset when he's on his belly, go with your instinct, doctors aren't always right, a few years ago we were advised to let them sleep on their belly's, now we would get told off for that!!|`|Io28z8l2aa	we put our daughter on her daddy's chest so she has something to lift her head to look at. keeps her entertained :)    another thing is just putting your baby on his tummy for just a minute or two after each nappy change. our health visitor reccomended this to us, as some tummy time is better than no tummy time.    when your son gets older he will begin to tolerate it better and will enjoy it. good luck!|`|68c6B8dRaa	"30 minutes he should have."    This is BS; find a new pediatrician not into nonsensical recommendations. "Proper cranium development" indeed... Quite unnecessary to torture your baby.    If he is _held_ and not left laying on his back 24/7 you have nothing to worry about. Buy a sling.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	First of all, who says you shouldn't let your newborn cry??  That's ridiculous!!  It's healthy for newborn babies to cry, it improves the lung function.  As for belly time, it's silly for a newborn unless you put the baby on your belly.  Once the baby is old enough to move around on the floor, they will take care of strengthening their head and neck themselves.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I dont agree with your DR. Tummy time is NOT needed. ever. for anyone. your baby will learn to lift his head and roll over when he is ready.     Tummy time was 'discovered' when parents were relying on swing and cribs and just letting the baby lay around on their back all day.    if you really want, try laying on your back and putting him on your chest, on his tummy. my daughter loved that|`|QV348MiIaa	I'm trying to figure out the same thing, and my son is 3 months old this week.  On the positive side, he will learn to do plenty w/o that 30 minutes of belly time.  Our son hates tummy time, but he is learning to sit up, he already holds his head up very well, he's trying to stand (or at least enjoying the practice), and his head is still shaped nicely (no big flat spot).  So, if your son won't cooperate, keep trying, but don't worry too much - but if I find an answer to your question before I find one to mine, I'll let you know too.    Good luck & congratulations|`|ls8ND4jXaa	Maybe you can try putting him on your chest while you're laying down. Then he'll see your face and you can talk to him. Maybe he'll feel more secure that way. When he gets more comfortable with it you can start putting him on the floor.|`|4AO2myzKaa	If he is a new, newborn, with the cord stump still on I wouldn't put him on his belly.  If he doesn't like it now, I would wait a week and try again.  It's not going to hurt him or stunt his growth if he doesn't get that time.  You want to make sure he is happy and comfortable, and when he is ready he will enjoy the belly time.  It just may be a few more weeks...also try different approaches, like having him on your bare chest, or try having him on a blankie on the floor, etc.  If he cries for all of them just wait.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Being belly to belly with you while you are reclined counts as tummy time. There is no rule that says it must be on the floor. The idea is to improve neck, back, and arm muscles and to provide some time each day that the baby isn't on the back of it's head.  Get creative.|`|hneetSf2aa	Well if the baby is NEWBORN they dont need tummy time..you start tummy time at 3 months or so....put down some toys the baby likes and eventually things will go smoothly|`|xK6wehG7aa	Tummy time is not necessary. I have never done it with my son because he screamed every time I put him down. Just holding your baby and having them look around at things will help develop his muscles, or laying him on your stomach belly to belly is good too. If he doesn't like it, don't force him to do it.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it's reall not that serious- try jsut having baby lay on your chest- that's enough belly time. he doesn't need 30 minutes     crying does not improve lung function in fact you may recieve less oxygen that way- breathing improves lung function. if they are breathing then they don't ned any more improvements if their lungs are already working|`|wENdWT5kaa	He doesn't need tummy time. If he doesn't like it, then don't make him do it.     And regarding the "shouldn't let a newborn cry". ugh...babies cry, that is what they do. I'm not saying letting him continuously cry, but i do find it sad that some parents jump and pick them up the mili-second the baby cries. My son is 2 months old, if he's in his swing, chair or bassinet and starts crying, i don't run to his side the second i hear him. If i'm playing with my daughter, i just move at my regular pace. Unless it is a pain cry, then i do rush to him.  There is nothing wrong with letting a baby cry longer then 5 seconds.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Instead of putting him on the floor put him on your belly and talk to him and make faces at him when he's on his belly.

(In fact, several states -- including the District of Columbia, California and Arkansas -- have made booster seats a requirement and other states are working on similar legislation).<br>  <br>  Children too tall or too large for a convertible seat, but too small (shorter than 4 feet 9 inches and lighter than 80 pounds) for a seat belt, should be placed in a high-backed booster seat. There are two types of booster seats: a high-backed booster seat and a simple booster without the back. High-backed boosters typically accommodate two methods of strapping your child in: the five-point harness that you've used with other seats (for smaller/younger children), and the shoulder and lap harness from your vehicle (used for larger/older children). For more information on booster seats, see the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.|`|zhJOZhKEaa	Every step 'up' in carseats is a step down in safety.

EtCRnDJMaa	That would be very hard to decide.  I would have to say that I would want all of my babies to be healthy.  You can have as many as 6 and have them all be healthy, but you never know.  I would think about reducing the amount down to 2.  I respect all the mothers & fathers who have not, they have real strength & hearts made of steal.  I don't think as a person I could handle any more than 3 babies at one time.  I might lose my mind & my temper and this would not be good.  So I would have to say that I would reduce the amount down to 2    If I had a choice then I wouldn't want all to be implanted to begin with.  This way you don't have to make this choice.|`|jdRKZe18aa	That's a really tough call.  If it was a black & white answer period I'd have to say morally I think it would be wrong to selectively reduce the number of embryos... but realistically and rationally I think to sustain SOME LIFE is better than risking all life isn't it?  SO gosh, I would only hope it was NEVER a question I would have to make a decision on myself.   Hopefully the parents involved would decide themselves after much thought & prayer for themselves and with God's guidance & direction.|`|AA10167940	If I could not concieve naturally, I would adopt a child.      I also would never terminate a pregnancy.  IVF or otherwise-|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think that is a complex decision best left up to the mother, her partner, her doctor & her own conscience.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I think that if I were in that position, I would opt to do the selective reduction.  It is my understanding that when IVF is done, more embryos are implanted than what are expected to attach and thrive, resulting in a high number of babies.  I feel that I would most definitely want to increase my own chances of survival, especially if I already had children that I would be leaving behind.  I just can't see losing my own life as well as the lives of several babies over keeping my life and keeping 3 or 4 babies.  Something is better than nothing.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Wow, that is a very complex question. I can't say that I have an answer on whether it's right or wrong for everyone, just myself. I could not choose. I could not kill some embryos and let others live so I would have to just trust nature and make it an all or nothing situation. If we all died then it would be very sad but if I made the choice to kill some I couldn't live with myself so really there is no question for me.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I dont think more embryos should be placed in a mother, than the parents can afford to support and pay the hospital bills for.      I think this is one reason insurance doesnt cover much for fertility, look at these crazy hospital costs.  It does more harm for people TTC than good.|`|723QHuicaa	Im pro choice, as my first point.    My sencond point is, i dont think i could donate them. i dont think i could live with a child with my dna and a half sibling to my daughter being out there and never knowing it. This attitude disgusts me, i have an infertile cousin, caused ny chemo at 7m old. But I cant help how I feel.    Implanting them just so they dont get destroyed... No, I wouldnt risk having a multiple, dangerous labour and delivery when its cells with no feeling, no emotion, no cognitive activity. Its cells in a test tube, i wouldnt put me or the potential children through that then possibly grow to resent those children because i only implanted them to stop destruction|`|C5pVfdzwaa	A woman who doesn't want more babies than she can handle in one pregnancy should have the right to reduce.  She's not superwoman.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I think that a responsible doctor would cancel the cycle if it looked like she had to many mature follicles.  IVF generally they don't put back more than 2-3, OI-ovulation induction used alot with PCOS women is where you can overstimulate and produce 15-20-25 mature follicles, making it most likely that the outcome would be at least 5-6 babies.  In my state there are really only two RE's, and neither would allow this to happen.  I have had my cycle canceled, and both of these docs have been my doc.      My opinion is that the moral obligation falls towards canceling the cycle before there are too many embryos, which in essence would be a therapeutic abortion|`|j2mRop0laa	Ok, I will get mauled for this. But you asked....    I think it's completely irresponsible NOT to reduce the embryos when there are more than say 3. Four is just too many.     Not to reduce the embryos increases the risks of health problems for mommy and babies. Triplets are fairly common and still pose a risk, but I have seen healthy triplets born with healthy weights, late in pregnancy. The chances just keep dropping with the more you carry.  Why in the world would anyone choose to RISK losing them all instead of decreasing the risks for a few? It's beyond me.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Geesh that would be a VERY hard decision for me to make...I don't really know what I would do...I am just glad I was able to conceive my children with out any help I feel sorry for the mother who would have to choose what to do cause I know it would be hard!|`|TQW5E6olaa	While I am okay with Abortion (Hopefully medically necessary, I would prefer people choose adoption, but I understand the need for abortions in general) I am not okay with selectively reducing the number of embryos already inside someone. People that want children that badly, shouldn't be eliminating potential children, but they also shouldn't implant so many at a time.    I understand IVF is expensive and that they do such a high number to ensure their chances of getting just one healthy baby, but I don't think they should do SO many. Also, they should monitor the mother with regards to fertility drugs because the recent mom, they claim didn't have 8 embryos implanted, that the years of fertility drug usage in her body, multiplied the embryos that were implanted. How scary is that?    Personally, If i was doing IVF, I wouldn't ask for more than 3 embryos at a time. My insurance covers IVF up to 6 attempts so having to go multiple times wouldn't be hard for me financially. However, I would be so depressed if after finally getting pregnant, that I couldn't safely carry all the babies, or was at risk to have 5 + at a time unless I reduced...|`|gx4s68s8aa	This simple solution is just not put that many embryos in a mother in the first place.  The way I think of it 3 or 4 is about the limit of nature for a woman to have at one time.  I mean twins are common, triplets are less common and every once an a while I mother will naturally have quads.  So if doctors would only implant no more than 3 or 4 babies into a woman then the issue would not exist.  Because most woman can carry 3 or 4 with good medical care.  So doctors should never put more than four in a woman regardless of her age.    Fertility drugs are another story- but I don't believe in selectively reducing embryos.  I don't know exactly how you avoid more than four with some fertility drugs.|`|sv4guUQNaa	I don't agree with IVF because it creates many embryo's which will not even get implanted and have a shot at life so in my opinion IVF is wrong even before you get to make a choice of selectively reducing them.  You can probably tell that I don't agree with selective reduction after the fact and yes, I'm a big pro-lifer.|`|xRJQSNJeaa	I think it all depends on the circumstances and what not. I am personally against abortion it's my own moral standards and wether or not someone else does it is there own business. But if I were to get pregnant with 8 babies there was a reason why I got those eight babies I wouldn't abort them. But if two did die in the womb i would be devestated and upset. But in no means would I abort anyone of those tiny little miracles. Also if I got pregnant with eight babies and didnt have the means or funds to take care of them I would give them up for an open adoption so a family that couldn't have children could experience them but I could still watch them grow. That is my personal opinion. And everyone has there own views and whatnot. I think  the only way I could have the doctors abort if there was a legitimate medical reason that would harm me to abort. But it's not consider and abortion if your pregnant with multiples it's called a reduction and I would ONLY do it if necessary.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i don't know what i would do.  i really dont.  how could I choose which child to terminate and which to not.  do i currently have kids that would lose their mother if i didn't do it?  i have no idea.  it would be a terrible situation and I really have absolutely no idea what I would do.  my husband and I have been talking about it - what would we do and we can't figure it out.  i'll just hope to never be in that situation at this point.    see my question about that topic - http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2... NOT a debate about anyone!!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Personally, if I had to go through IVF, I first wouldn't let them do more than 3 eggs. (All 3 would be implanted together). That solves the high number risk unless they all turn into twins. Even then, no, I don't think I could reduce....    It is a deeplu personal decision, and I'm not going to judge anyone for doing it.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	I have thought about this a lot since I heard Kate Gosselin (Jon and Kate + 8) say that she couldn't do it when she found out she was having sextuplets.  I carried triplets and it never once crossed my mind to reduce them (and we were never asked to consider it).  I think that, for me it is similar to abortion - I don't think I could do it.  How do you look at an ultrasound and say "Get rid of A, B and F"?      I think the better option would be to not implant that many in the first place.  I understand that lowers the chances of survival but the others could be used later.|`|DDFSITiYaa	First of all, I find it offensive when people with multiples who went through IVF spout off about how it was "God's will' that they had 4,5,8,10 whatever babies at once.  BULL!!!  Science created those babies, not God.  So, if selective reduction is chosen, it should be done based on a scientific decision.  If you choose science to conceive then you use science again to manage the pregnancy.  If God's will had been relied upon, then that family would not exist.      Secondly, given that the product of that science is a human being, I would have to say it would depend on the situation and the liklihood of impact on the mother/other babies.  I think the greater good has to be considered.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	This is the very reason that we should not play with the creation or destroying of life...    The more and more we try and get involved and take over... play God, the more problems, tragic situations, and difficult decisions come up.    Although I am not 100% against invitro procedures (because being a mommy/daddy is so special), it is a very very grey area that I struggle with because of these very reasons.    How many babies is a good  ?  How do you know that 8 or 7 is a bad  ?  The mother of 8 is perfectly healthy... what if she "aborted" 2 just so she would be "ok" and then turns out she didn't have to do that.  What if you abort the wrong one - you know, the smartest one of the batch?    I'm just saying... the more we meddle the more problems we cause ourselves.|`|GPn55rjTaa	Being in the medical field, I understand the importance of this procedure medically.  But morally, selective reduction is still killing viable embryos injectingtly potassium chloride intheirier hearst and killing them.  This is the saprocedureure we use for open hearts surgeries to stop the heart during the bypass.  But is the heart surgescenariorio, the heart and lungs are put on a machine that does the work for them during the surgery.  Hmm...|`|7MJSPGnhaa	I do not believe in selective reduction regardless of the threat to the mother's life.|`|C55pji5Qaa	I think,as many others have said, that their should not be that many put back.We did IVF and we put back all 3 that fertilized. None were leftover, I did not KILL any embryos as someone suggested. We were willing to accept if all three had implanted. Although it is very possible for embryos to split,it would be very rare for every single one of them to split. This is also not playing God. Their are many women who can not get pregnant even with IVF so if it does work than it is a miracle from God. Luckily we have the God-given intelligence to help people who are having trouble. Being high risk with just twins, I would reduce if more than 4. It is not just about affording the children but it is about giving each child the time and attention they deserve. I agree it is irresponsible to put back that many and it is irresponsible to continue with a pregnancy with that low of odds.I respect others opinions but this is what I think after going through the process.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I did consider INVTRO, because I was always told I could never have my own ( i did actually have 1 baby...he was a shock and surprise  but there he was lol)  BUt is was sooooooooo expensive and it carried the possibility of multiples and I could never abort. I am pro choice...but I would never abort babies that I willingly placed inside myself.  Placing 8 embryos to only abort a few to me is just as irresponsible as the woman who has unprotected sex. Why do some people think it is ok to abort Inverto embryos but not ok for a woman who made an "oops" to abort? Isn't life all the same??    From my understanding it is now considered very irresponsible for a doctor  to implant more than 3 at a time...and I believe in some states even illegal because of the dangers to mom and babies.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	It's extremely rare for a natural pregnancy to have enough embryos that selectively reducing the number is something necessary.  Naturally occurring multiple births are very rare and most of those are twins.  Triplets, quads, etc are almost unheard of.     So, let's base this on multiple embryos from IVF.  I firmly believe that a doctor is at fault if more embryos are introduced than can safely be delivered.  Most doctors will not implant more than 3 embryos at a time, and it's more than likely that 1-2 of those embryos will not attach to the uterine wall.      Now, if a doctor implants 3 embryos and all three split into identical twins and all 6 manage to implant, now there is a problem.  The human body just isn't designed to give birth to litters.  It's not safe for the mother and dramatically increases the chance for birth defects for the babies.      That said, I think that the choice lies entirely with the mother (and father).  The placement of where the embryos attach in the uterus can have an effect on the prognosis, so can the health of the mother, so can a number of other factors.  But the most important thing is that we are dealing with human lives.  It's not for anyone else to make that critical decision.      Personally, if the above scenario happened with me and it was the best advice of my doctors to selectively reduce, I would do it.  It would be a heartwrenching decision, but it would be my decision to make.
dDQLlVF3aa	at 2 your daughter wont really understand much of a difference, she'll see it as great! i'm going to grandmas. as for explaining it to her, tell her that you are going to go to the doctor so that they can fix you, you'll be gone for a few days but you'll come back as soon as possible. she will understand that, and as long as perhaps she can talk to you on the phone after youre able, she'll be okay. her grandmother needs to make sure that her schedule is followed to the most part. things will work out.

They make it so they can't push the buttons.    http://www.amazon.com/Parent-Units-22663...|`|GZdvHbT5aa	Honey, I sign an accident report about twice a week on my son. It is always the same....    "Sam climbed on top of toy chest and jumped off, bumped head, ice applied and TLC given"     He is a boy and is going to climb, all you can do is be there as much as you can to keep him from falling off stuff.    As for the TV thing, Sam did the same, the way we got him to stop was putting duct tape over the power button. Kind of ghetto, but he couldn't see it anymore, and forgot about it.|`|ZKHaLbdEaa	Shock collar and barbed wire.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Tap his hand and say no.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Eh...I have this problem, the scariest is the dining table. I was doing dishes with my back to Bella, she was playing on the floor, when I looked up 3 minutes later, she was in her high chair... She climbed up a chair, across the table, and climbed in her chair. It scared me so bad.     I redirect, say no firmly, that's about it. Take the dangerous climbing things away, etc.     I would love one of those TV guards, but we have an old school big screen, it wouldn't work :(|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	if he is old enough to disobey he is old enough to be disciplined for it! we use spanking but we make sure that he says he is sorry and then we tell him we forgive him and dont bring it up again. actually when our son was smaller he kept doing that so we would tell him that was a no-no and smack his hand. it worked and he quit doing it!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	We do the duct tape thing too!!    I've been through the tv button problem (tv is low to the ground), now I have a climbing issue and he REFUSES to be *redirected* to anything else. I put stuff up onto the coffee table but he just pulls that down and climbs right up there! I think they need to make those plastic tv guards for coffee tables too.    ETA: I could use that TV guard for my 4 year old (who is obsessed with pushing TV buttons...so much that he broke the power button off his TV AND has broken the DVD player more times than I can count...this last time it was for good.)|`|aWckGacbaa	been there  :-)    i solved this by saying "no"  in a firm voice and sticking him in the play pen ( we only used it for time out and called it the penalty box)  for 3-5 min.  when they are in there i totally ignore them and yo may find he pushes the bottom just to get your attention cause even neg attention is better then none..it took awhile but he got tired of getting stuck in there and moved on...  depending on how you feel about it you can add a swat to their hand or bottom.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I can't get Chase to leave anything alone.  He's fallen off of countless items and nothing seems to phase him.  He gets kinda mad when he has a time out, but apparantly not mad enough to stop.  I guess they are just boys, ya know?
faPKwClPaa	You probably only got one answer because this whole thing is not a good idea.  <br>  <br>  You're willing to put your daughter at risk for his kid?  <br>  <br>  I understand he's family, but that doesn't mean you're obligated to take him in, rehabilitate him (if that's even possible), all the while having to keep an eagle eye on everyone.<br>  <br>  And the fact your wife keeps 'forgetting' about him is just odd.   She's either not really on-board with this or is completely oblivious to the seriousness of the situation.<br>  <br>  Either way, I wouldn't do this if I were you.  I know you have good intentions, but it's just not worth it.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Have you tried to talk to him about things he has gone through or what he thinks about living with you and what rules does he think he should have.|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	i don think u have anything to worry about.. if ur nephew has already been in state care he should have repented by now..<br>  <br>  and he is ur relative.. so i don think u need to worry..<br>  <br>  and u say he is drawn to ur daughter.. that's good.. it will help to close the gap .. but if u feel insecure, let the authorities know..|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	I do not see why you are assuming the worst. Have you ever had both children in the same room together or do you keep them apart as if he is a criminal. If he raped someone he would not be in state care, he would be in a juvenile detention center. If he hurt someone with a weapons, he would be in juvenile detention center. Not state care. Something happened with his parents that they will not tell you, although they should. You say his mom comes to, she should be able to tell you. <br>  <br>  Foster children are not axe murderers. Foster children are often labeled as special needs as they get older for someone to take them for a check when there is nothing wrong. Why don't you ask him what happened? He is 17 years old. I'm sure he can tell you. <br>  <br>  It is so sad to see people act this way. It may not be in the best interests of the child for him to stay with you if you are going to treat him like dirt. It also seems like they are just going to let his 18th birthday slide by so they do not have to do any work! How sad! <br>  <br>  If he does end up staying there and the foster agency keeps stalling, please teach him basic skills for life, such as how to cook for yourself and how to balance a checkbook, how to get a scholarship to college or apply for financial aid and so on.|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	Why do you have to wait for a report. Does he and his mother not know what he has done and or accomplished. What is so secretive that they themselves can't clue you in. And what is it that you suspect why a 17 year old adult is drawn to a 7 year old child. Obviously you do not feel comfortable with this idea. And what could a 7 year old child could have done that kept him locked up for 10 years before being deemed as releasable. The man has grown up in an environment which you can only imagine. So you want to be Mr. nice guy and put your entire family in an uncomfortable position to accommodate this person in what is supposed to be your castle. Your home, your peaceful place in life. Good luck to you and your family. It will never be the same. And remember, if in fact your instincts are correct about his attraction to your child. You may both end up in prison for neglect, creating an unsafe environment for you, your child and your entire family or worse. Just curious. What kind of people would put such a burden on you. Obviously their concern is the 17 year old possible violent man. Not you and your family. The state wants this guy out of their house in your house. OK... Let me put it this way. Are you crazy. Good Luck Mr. Nice guy. See you on the 5: O' CLOCK NEWS|`|aJjV5b95aa	I completely understand that you are worried about your daughters safety and that he is family and you want him to stay with you and not in foster care. I thing that when you are allowed to see his past records you will get a better idea of what to do next. I don't think that there is much you can do about keeping an eye on them and doing the things you have to do. You could try to set up activities for them to work on while you are doing something for example yard work you could have them playing a game while outside while you are doing the yard work but that is not something you are going to be able to do at the time. Also is your wife really okay with the whole situation. I think that it is a little odd that she forgets to supervise them. maybe you should talk to her about the situation again. Things are going to be hard if decide to keep you nephew especially since he is 17 but just remember somethings are just not meant to be and as long as you do your best on helping him you should not down yourself.|`|lyeXgk4Uaa	Honestly, if you can't trust him around your daughter how will you ever be able to accept him into your family?  Is there some reason his mother can't take him?|`|iLLoc003aa	I think that they should give you that information prior. What if you decide he is not a good fit for your daughter after you get the information? It will be more devastaing to your nephew..I was a foster parent and kids from abuse and neglect have many psychological issues...one of my foster kids who was 10 at the time just went nuts one morning and started acting crazy! He trashed my whole house and broke my front windows..I kept calling the foster care agency to come in and intervene since its a hands off basis and they never came...it took the 3 hours...by then I had to call the State Police to remove him from my home...poor kid...|`|oWAUb6vpaa	I may as well admit right away that I do not agree with what you may be doing. However, there are ways to protect your daughter, etc. <br>  <br>  I'll begin here: <br>  He's 17. Your daughter is 7 and considering that this teen boy (nearly an adult) has an extensive history of "issues", he's definitely a risk to your child.* <br>  <br>  Are you planning on continuing care for this boy well after his 18th birthday? Seems like you are and I would think it's really not a good idea when considering your young, fragile little girl. <br>  I also don't see how your wife "forgets" he's there. Doesn't speak well of her parenting or love for the little girl. How do you forget?? Impossible. Seems like she's ignoring the fact, then she can't be at fault if or when something serious happens. Right? Planned cop-out. <br>  <br>  Are you trying to get custody of the teen boy before or after 18 years of age? If before, the state would have to inform you of his history right away, before the teen boy is even set to be placed in your home. You really need that information beforing allowing him to take a place in your little girl's life. <br>  Now, if you're not taking him until after 18 yrs old, then the state is not obligated to give you any information on him (his history) what so ever. Why isn't the mother giving you info? Maybe she won't give everything up - there could be hundreds of reasons I could think of right now.. <br>  <br>  This boy needs therapy. Not only is this necessary to help him, but this should be mandatory for him if he's going to be in your home where there's a young child. You need to talk to your daughter about many things. She has the right to know that this boy could be a danger to her. She needs to know that she MUST talk to you if this boy makes her uncomfortable in anyway and she needs to be reminded that if he threatens to her hurt for telling, that it's not going to happen and she must come to you right away reagrdless of what he tells her or does. <br>  You seriously need to limit the amount of time she spends with him and make sure that they are always supervised* (not ever left alone with eachother.) <br>  Your wife is already a problem.* You need to talk to her asap because she doesn't need to be ignoring the fact that this boy has problems and is potentially a serious danger to your daughter - she needs to care and stop pretending he's not there when he is - it's almost like she wants him to hurt your child - maybe she has issues too - speaking of that, I believe she needs counseling as well if this boy is going to be in your home.*  <br>  If you don't do any of this, then this boy does not belong there with you all. You need to protect your daughter, your family beforing trying to take care of a teen boy that you did not create nor destoy. <br>  <br>  I feel really bad for your daughter - she really needs to be spoken to and it needs to be constant. She could benefit from counseling as well if this boy/adult does indeed come to live there, even if he hasn't done anything wrong to her. It'll help her to know what to do if an issue occurs, and also will give her the assurance that she can safely go to someone who can help. <br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful and lots of luck to you - you seem to be kind hearted. Most luck to your little girl and her safety.
kiAQi91laa	I think most women start when their into their second trimester.  Now, I started about 20 weeks into my pregnancy, but I had a friend that said she started when she was only 8 weeks into her pregnancy.  Each individual is different.      Why not just take a over the counter test to find out if you Truly are pregnant and go from there?
nZVmkZSBaa	Higher risk of autism, down syndrome... basically a higher chance that he/she would have any mental disabilities. Also, preterm labour, miscarriage, and death during labour. But... those risks apply for everybody really, don't let that stop you. I'm a teen, there are loads of risks, but so far things are fine. AFP came out fine... so I'm happy. Good luck! (:|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	Higher risk of Downs.... As we get older the quality of our eggs gets worse meaning that birth defects are more common...  I think after 45 our chance of having a Down's baby is something like 1 in 4 (which seems VERY high to me).  Also, low birth weight and complications in pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia are a little higher, but you would simply be monitered a little more closely....  Prenatel care is mostly fab these days. Obviously there is the age you will be when the child is off your hands finally!  Some people look forward to a LONG adulthood and retirment after child bearing and some love to have them around.  I am the oldest of 5 children with large gaps between us and 2 of which born to my mother over 40, both of whom are perfectly healthy and well, and a perfect joy to my mother (most of the time!)  Anyway having kids a little later on is all the rage now!  All the best. xx|`|XZHx3v4Raa	when you get 30.you start to lose tissue.its dangerous for you and the baby.your child could have birth defects and you'll probally get a c-section|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Mostly birth defects. But look at it this way...almost all of the woman in hollywood are now having babies in their 40's. Its "in" now lol|`|77NzfiVkaa	Mostly high risk of miscarriage. There is also a risk of still births, birth defects, and in extreme cases a woman may lose her life during labor but that's not very likely with technology and medicine the way it is these days.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Birth defects..  High risk of misarage..|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Higher risk of having a child with birth defects.    TX Mom|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I believe Downs Syndrome is the biggest.|`|YuA7a08Maa	There is a close to 50% miscarriage rate by age 45, so you might have to deal with that.  There's also an increased chance of Down's syndrome.  However, these things may never happen and things could go great.  Good luck!|`|5looQMxiaa	Defects...you might die............. its risky that's all|`|3XUuxALyaa	downs syndrome increases exponentially with age. the risk of it above 40 is remarkably high. and gets outrageous above 50. and yes there can be other complications such as you not physically being able to deal with the strain it can cause. younger bodies are alot more robust|`|QBpJxWCmaa	There are tons of risks.  You should atleast be taking a prenatal viatimin for a year.  Id talk to a dr about this.  Its pretty serious.  One thing people dont know about Hollywood stars having babies in their late 30s early 40s is they have all the money in the world to spend on getting pregnant.  Best wishes!!  Please seek medical advice!!
YhjFiVGyaa	it feels like a normal period cramp. sometimes its even followed by diarrhea and constiparion which makes it feel worse.|`|E9F6qjRWaa	i have been wondering about this myself  i was ttc last week and now this week i have been having that same feeling and last night when my fiance and i were done having fun (tmi) i was so sore like around my pelvis, and this morning i had really bad constipation...so i am going through the same thing as you , i think hope it is a early sign of pregnancy    good luck  lots and lots of baby dust
n3h9Byhpaa	They don't.. at all.  Probably like 5% of teens are actually in love.  Others are just infatuated with eachother.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	They don't.|`|qL2HCxzMaa	Wow, this question saddens me. Love knows no age it knows no color, simply put. Some teenagers do make bad decisions by sleeping with those they love or have strong feelings for but not all of us do.|`|l4H81i7Naa	I married when I was 18 and we are still together. just because I wasn't out of my teens for 2 more years doesn't make me incompetent for knowing who I love. plus... every teenager thinks they are in love at some point in there lives.|`|RvOilUZjaa	i have a complex opinion on this subject based on my religion, but on a short note, i agree that mostly, under vague circumstances, teens cannot recognize actual love.|`|d0fc65f726f4bd56a6ce4f789ee11991aa	They usually don't. Teens are usually immature and stupid and just infatuated with each other. My (now) ex- best friend would get a new bf about every month and after a freakn' WEEK of being together they'd be all like Oh I love you so much.   I do know what love is. I like long relationships that can actually mean something.. and even if I've never felt the BIG love or whatever. I know what it means to fall in love with someone or just love them.  So yes teens can be stupid when it comes to love. But weren't you too? And not every one of them is like that. I sure as hell know I'm not..|`|kZ2xRHrMaa	The ones that ask guidance from strangers about their love life are obviously NOT in tune with what real love is.|`|ArZqPe8Jaa	I dont know that its a question of weather or not they know what love is its more like are they mature enough to deal with that love...As most young married couples will tell you the reson for there divorce was becasue they simply just grew apart.... people change. My husband and I have been together since I was 15 i am now almost 21 and we have undergone many changes some things were hard to get through and some not so hard... But by the time we are 25 who knows what will be different we spend alot of time talking to eachother about how we feel about things we are both ver very open with one another if  Idont like something that he is doing or a decision he has made I tell him and vise versa We disagree on  things all the time but we always try and talk it out. So teens could love one another but they are not really mature enough to grasp what that means its not this he worships the ground I walk on thing that they think its all communication and work and honesty and trust... and that might just be the concept they can not understand yet.|`|AA11311675	So what? You learn from your mistakes|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Between 13 and like 16, you think you know everything and just assume you're in love. You think it will be a happy ending no matter what. It's most likely not true. I thought I was 'in love' at 15....I wasn't. Didn't realize it until 17. You just need to learn from your mistakes. ??|`|r39EDGhPaa	They don't know.  They think they do, but after they break up they will find someone else and "love" them too. I know too many girls like that.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	This is how people learn to love.  And it's love to them.    So yes, they understand real love in their own perception of it.|`|Y2k81CWWaa	dont underestimate teens just bc theyre younger|`|kDvKc3npaa	how are we supposed to know if we don't experiment.  I'm not saying to have sex with the first person you think you're in love with.  but how are we ever going to learn what love is if we don't have what we think is love in our lives.?|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	i agree they have no idea wat love is|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Most don't.|`|S9F6RUncaa	I'm only in 8th grade but I have been with my boyfriend for a while( a year on sunday!). I don't have sex with him at all. I try to make wise decisions and I know thats not a wise one to make. So for me I feel like I love him but not enough to have sex if thats what you mean.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I totally agree with you ?|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	they don't, they think they do but they don't.    They are naive in the sense that they don't realize that if they really were in love then they wouldn't be asking us whether or not they should have sex.|`|njLalVIwaa	The first person is right.  Some do fall inlove young others make that mistake.  I overheard a girl the same age as me, I'm 15, saying, "I know it's love because we have been together a month" now that is stupidity.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Ditto with the first person..  &Scientifically your brain cannot understand love until the age 22.|`|HonBurxQaa	They dont they just think that they know what it is!! I t doesnt exist when you are that young!!
OGEC7RFwaa	every teacher has a different method of teaching. this new teacher probably gives homework every night to teach responsibility and to make sure that you have actually learned and know what was taught in class the previous day.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	so that the teacher knows how much you have learned. When he/she marks the homework they tend to see a pattern of mistakes and this helps them plan their future lessons.|`|2qsbDj7Aaa	to review what we are learning in class|`|siif0K84aa	Shows if you have learned what they taught you. I really should be working on my essay due tomorrow right now but I really really loathe it and my USB drive for not working.|`|cb5WcNHsaa	the same stupid crap because of responsibility and reviews|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Practice, repsonsibility, priorities, etc.|`|Jl1ZwAmaaa	Like the other girls, practice, responsibity, and priorities are all traits we get through doing homework. Also, it teaches time management. Its just a sneaky way of teaching u life skills lol! Also, it forces u to study... lastly, DID U KNOW it takes the average person 9 times of hearing the same thing before it really sinks in?? Repetition.... its the key to learning and studying!|`|W8cf9Dxjaa	to understand what you are learning|`|U0KCmsKXaa	It teaches responsibility.

1tmX7xbRaa	don't take it personally. it sounds to me like being a grandmother is making her feel old or something like that so to avoid mortality issues she wants to be called something else. i'd say let this one go and ignore her. if she wants to be called le le then who cares anyway? however if she is being negative about you and your sisters pregnancy then tell her to keep her mouth shut unless she has something nice to say.being a grandmother is supposed to be special and if she doesn't see it that way then to heck with her. she'll eventually realize the error of her ways|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Sounds like she has an old complex. My mother is grandma and my husbands aunt (long story, she raised him and my boys are like her grandsons) is called nanna. My moms not old, either. She turned 46 this year and has 6 grandkids. Maybe you should let her know that not getting called grandma won't change the fact she is one.     Don't let it get to you. Your kids will decide what they want to call her. Kids generally call their grandparents nanna, grams, granny, nanny, gramgram, etc.|`|AA10531094	I don't see anything wrong with your mom's request.  This is a new age and my granddaughter calls me "Nan." I didn't want to be called NaNa or Grand Mom.  I'm a young grandmother and I prefer to be called Nan.  So, you should respect your mother's wishes.  Good Luck!|`|x4uGfC4oaa	My friend's mom is named Paula, and she has three grandchildren who call her "Nee-Nee." I don't know where this came from, I always thought that it was just what the oldest started calling her.    Becoming a grandmother is probably making her feel old, so try not to be too hard on her. Letting her be called whatever she wants isn't as big of a deal as most of your life is and will be with this baby!    All I can say is that grandparents sometimes are crazier than the expectant mother! =)|`|Igyp0mB1aa	Mamas, is what my nieces calls my mum.|`|AA11024148	mom can't handle the fact that she's getting older.   midlife crisis on the way soon...    you don't have to put up with being spoken to like that. tell her she needs to get over herself. i bet she's a drama queen, too.    i have a grand daughter (my stepdaughter's stepdaughter) who calls me 'grammy'. she was born on my 30th birthday. i am the only grammy she knows. i don't care what she calls me as long as she calls me; and doesn't call me by my first name.|`|0WstfAmzaa	I would just respect her wishes and refer to her as LeLe for the time being.  You never know, maybe after the grandkids arrive (or in the year or so it takes for them to actually start being able to call her anything at all) she'll change her mind and want to be referred to as GiGi or even Grandma.  Maybe she's just having a crisis about being grandma - thinking she's too young or something like that.. Just don't stress about it, it's not worth it.  Enjoy your pregnancy and congratulations.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Some women panic when they hear the word Grandma.  It makes them feel old.  My children called my grandmother Nana.  My cousins mother did not want to be called grandma so they call her Mimi.  It doesn't matter as long as she is involved.  GOod luck hun!|`|G2auAv1Saa	Maybe she pictures 'grandma' as an old lady in a rocker with a bun and she doesn't see herself that way.   My mother wanted to be called granny and that is what we called her and when my daughter started talking she started calling her MiMi- so really the child will kinda decide what they will call her.|`|gx4s68s8aa	What is wrong with LeLe?  Honestly it sounds like you both are being a bit hormonal.  She didn't need to scream at you, but I don't see why there is a problem.  She is likely having a hard time being a grandmother.  Not because she doesn't already love your soon to be children, but because she sees being a grandmother as being old.  My mother wants to be called JuJu- her name is Judy, because she knows that the other grandmother can't be called that.      Could be worse, my MIL insists on being called MawMaw.  I hate that name because it is so close to MaMa.  And my daughter is bit of a late talker and whenever she tries to say MawMaw it sounds like MaMa.  I hate that.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Maybe once she lays eyes on you and your sisters beautiful babies she will soften up to the idea of being called "Grandma", good luck|`|JsaEk8UAaa	What has she told your sister? How does your sister feel about it? When you visit with your mom, talk with her and the baby. Like if your mom gives you a gift or a hug look at you belly and gently rub and say 'wow that was grandma!' Are you close enough to her friends that you could ask them what is going on?? I would get to the bottom of the problem before feelings are hurt. Good luck!!!
1uxhfh6naa	Idiot. Of course it is, at three months old the fetus already has finger nails and countless other aspects, it may even be able to feel what you're doing to it since it has fingers! It may not be fully developed, but it's still living and can eat and sleep.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Glad to see you've asked this question with an open mind.  Maybe you should ask over in "Women's Studies" or "Women's Health" or even "Ethics."  Most of the women in this category are pregnant, and are celebrating the life growing within them, rather than wanting to scrape it out and put it out with the trash.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	But genetically it is. He/she has their own blood type,DNA. Their hair color,eye color are decided after conception. He/she has a detectable heart-beat at six weeks. Have you come across anything with a heartbeat that wasn't alive and living?    People desensitize themselves and try to look at it as clinically as they can, so if they decide to end the pregnancy,they won't feel guilty.|`|9QC1MD4Naa	I have a feeling you're asking this question just to get a rise out of people. Have fun with that.|`|TUkBRvfSaa	yea you tell them do you take drugs i do there SO good for ya tnx me bak|`|QOvUS6xVaa	because its killing a child, instead of women or little girls taking responsibility for opening their legs they prefer to think its just a glob of cells that can be cut up , sucked out and thrown into the trash when in reality its a baby.    women who do this should never be able to get pregnant again|`|1820cbafa20cad39a36d303c64470587aa	Meh. . . I think if you're having sex then you should have that kind of "chance" of getting pregnant on your mind.   You should be able to take care of it.  If you can't, then give it up for adoption.  Let someone else have a child.  It's that simple.  What I hate about hearing is that partial abortion.  Where the mother is full term and goes into labor, as soon as the baby's head comes out, they take scissors and pretty much decapitate it by putting it into the back of the neck.  What's the point?  Just have the poor thing and leave it at the hospital. . .|`|O5AF5IrQaa	well it all depends on your beliefs. personally, i believe that it is a baby from the moment the ovum cell becomes fertilized. So, getting an abortion is like ending a life. And who are YOU to decide whether a life lives or dies? It's a CHILD! not a choice! if it's not a baby THEN YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.|`|zXVIPLIyaa	http://www.klanparenthood.com/Aborted_Ba...|`|XJLgvjtMaa	Are you serious?  I agree with the few people who have already answered this. I'm against abortion.  The moment the baby gets a heartbeat, it's LIVING. Do you really believe that once a fetus gets a heartbeat it's still not "alive"?  Seriously. Don't kill poor babies for some woman's irresponsibility.  Give it up for adoption, there's plenty of families that would be more happy to have a baby. Whether she was irresponsible, raped, or whatever the case may be, there's ALWAYS, no matter where you're at, somebody willing to take the baby.

goP5E0Kxaa	If they both decide that they want children  then they will work together to raise a child.     It will make one another learn some of each other's weaknesses, as well as strengths . It will put a couple in stressful situations though where one parent might not met the expectations of another.     Also a parent who may have an ability , but lack the confidence, reassurance to comfortably be able to do it, may crack, bend, break under the pressure of parenting.    ^^ Which could lead to parent insecurity, fear to face their qualities that are repressed because of stress, fear to rise above those things , can lead to uncertainty in a relationship , even if deep down inside the person is an expert.    If someone has brilliant ideas about parenting, but lacks the confidence to show , live out those ideas, they will become distant, less self assured, a bruise to confidence. Parenting is being inside both heads to make an agreement that sounds best between two smart, thoughtful , self respecting adults.    Don't compete as parents , team work, and of course team work may bring people closer together but at the same time it could drive one another apart if its not considerate , and a real team effort .    Now, what if one parent is a genius, and the other bags groceries ? Nothing wrong with that, but parenting is a deep concern , it brings out the best of good people, it makes our greatest qualities shine. So if the relationship prior has an insecurity if the parenting is not done right then that insecurity may bloom  in large.    Having a child calls everyone out, its a big responsibility, a big deal,  small negative qualities can become magnified, and positive qualities can become horrendous, you can end up becoming inconsiderate of a partner without even realizing it.    It can also bring out the best of people , of course , and simply be a good thing, I think its important to balance that out between both parents, not just one. You must know that you are ready to improve, change, give it your all for a maximum healthy family. BOTH PARENTS    Yes parenting does take confidence, security, and consideration.      If your man is not confident, secure, then he might have a hard time starting off as a father.    If you're man is over secure, confident , then it might hurt as well because perhaps his reasons for this are that he is sexually active with you, free, and proud , like an American bold eagle, but then comes a child....this ego could lead to cheating, affairs , but that is another complicated set of twists and turns that might not even apply to you. If sex makes him feel secure, like a man, and bold, and if he does not have confidence in fathering a child, it could in the long run lead to an affair.     Parenting can be complicated and its prob different for every couple.    Just make sure that you are both ready. There are a lot of bad parents...    EDIT: Also consider that in working a job you now harbor new problems, how long can I work, how much to pay a sitter, can mother watch my baby today ? Etc Etc ..    Work may change you under that pressure, it may change how you view home, your attitude, it may change you. Then you get home and you have to go to work with the baby, take care of the baby....    Which can lead to more fights, arguing and if you don't argue well as a couple or are not entirely secure with one another's positive , negative traits this could lead to very hurtful times under the given stresses of working and taking care of a child.    Again negative qualities can shine, as well as positive now.    Mostly its attitude, if you are a strong person, and you need to be to be a strong person, then maybe its a good idea to have a child, if not then I don't know about it...|`|1WRB7RPNaa	not always, or maybe not right away|`|xxSGhywoaa	If a baby was born in to my husband's and my life, it would tear our relationship.  First of all we both hate babies and children.  (I don't care if it's different after you have your own).|`|hWc65sEtaa	In my case it did.|`|twVyisGnaa	It all really depends on your age and maturity.  It's kinda better to wait until you're older.  Learn to live life first while you are young.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|x4uGfC4oaa	No.|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	In a loving relationship, yes! If you're in a rocky relationship and think the baby is gonna "patch" things up, you're wrong. It will only drive you guys further apart, as the mother now needs to dedicate all her time to the child and leave the man aside (sorta speak).    Cheers =)|`|780ByZVEaa	definitly not, a kid will test your relationship|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Depends on the couple...for some I suppose once you get over the initial "teething problems" (not literally) it can bring them closer together...for others it can drive a wedge between them...|`|dPyfP0ijaa	NO, it actually causes more stress and less time and bonding together. It's so important that you have a string relationship with a mature man. Younger men can often get jealous of the baby and expect sex from you when you physically or emotionally don't want to.    It's very hard on relationships unless you have a rock-solid relationship to start with.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	Just the opposite. It is hard on people who are in a very healthy and loving relationship, let alone those who are on the rocks.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	It can. It all depends on your relationship, whether the pregnancy was wanted or not, where you guys are in your life, etc etc etc etc.... It can either bring you closer together or push you farther apart.|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	no it depends do you both want a baby|`|ZyTk2A93aa	nope. it causes more problems and then if they brake up the women is always left with the baby!|`|gkeuj7JYaa	no because then the spouse is going to care more about his kids then you..think about it.... this doesnt happen all the time but it does happen|`|B07sKfdvaa	It has worked that way for my wife and I twice now...and we're expecting our third in September...so hopefully it works again!  The secret really is that both of us feel that we need to do as much as we can to help with both kids.  Since we both feel that way, more often than not we end up doing it together.  It's a great way for the whole family to spend time together.  Dinner, playtime, bathtime, diapers, clean up, reading...we seem to do it all together when we're both home!|`|8chsXCH7aa	if your wanting to have a baby to bring you closer together, then dont.  you should get pregnant because you want a child to take care of and you can support it, not because you want to improve your relationship.|`|CKXkWTaKaa	no not really|`|zBhwEbUkaa	So far it has worked with me and my husband. We were close to start with, but now we are even closer. We just do more stuff together and get along really well now.|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	only if you are already close and both want a baby   even if you once were that way but arent now it will tear you further apart|`|GUUgeptjaa	It can go either way, it depends on the couple.  For my hubby and I we are definitely closer.  Albeit it was really hard on us as a couple in the beginning because we had less time together and now we have two and one on the way so it makes it really difficult sometimes, but we look at our babies and then us and it's like a beautiful thing to us to have a family together.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	That depends on if both parties want the same thing.  If so, then yes.  If not, then it'll make things worse.

ztzEloj5aa	Growing up my mother or father hardly ever told my sister and me that they loved us- they thought it should just be a given that we should know. When I have kids I am going to make sure I tell them everyday. I think this made it hard for me in relationships to really express myself towards men. I have really tried to open up and I believe that I have been able to do so with my current and some past relationships.     Also I would try to stay out of my child business unless its life threatening or it involves their well being. Even if I find out something they didnt want me to know. My mother questions everything I do now  Is 28 but its to the point where its not just questioning its nagging and I really hate my mother for doing that. I am to the point where I dont even tell her anything anymore.- Also she takes what I tell her and changes the story to what she wants or thinks it should be and tells the rest of the family  so now the story isnt true- it gets annoying. So i want to have a good relationship with my child and instead of nagging or questioning everything- just be a good listener when asked to listen and give good advise|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	My dad is full of pride (the bad kind). It's near impossible for him to forgive and accept things he does not agree with. As a result, I have been disowned by him for about 2 years. I don't think I'm a prideful person, so I don't think I'll have that problem as a parent. Another thing about my dad is that he is very difficult to approach, so I usually had to hide things from him and lie. I want my son to know that he can come to me for anything, without fear.    My mom is too soft and gives in too much. She may say she has limits for her kids (including me) but she hardly enforces them. I think that's why it was so easy to make mistakes . . . Doing bad things were easy for me to get away with because the authority in my life was either absent or way too loose.    My dad was all too firm with hardly enough love, and my mom was all loving and the complete opposite of firm. I believe in firm yet loving parenting, and that's what I wish to enforce in my children.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I never had bday parties and my son has a big one every year, My parents didn't play with me a lot and I take time out every day to do that. My parents did drugs and my father drank all the time, I DO NOT do drugs and almost never drink in front of my son. I could go on forever but those are some of the biggest things to me.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I don't want to over shelter my kids. I learned a lot of stuff on my own because my parents didn't have certain talks with me and we weren't really allowed to express our opinions. My younger sisters come to me when they have certain questions (especially about boys and sex) because they feel our mom gets upset when they ask her questions about that.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	I'll stress the importance of education a little more. My Mom just sort of trusts me to grow up well. That's a hard burden to bear.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I am going to make sure that I *really* listen to my kids and pick up on when they are feeling down so I can talk to them and cheer them up.    My mom seemed to be involved with my step-dad to the point where I felt pushed aside a little.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	mom was to needy fo rme as a kid and seltered me and told me i was shy .   I will let me kids explore and let them go places without me as well .  She used guilt a lot like i have no one to be with . you go with your friends . Or your brother sure needs friend y dont you have him go along? HE IS 7 YRS OLDER !!   My dad is a mean grouch ! He never parented me or did anything like that . He never earned the $$ either so many times i went without because he would lose his job do to being an a$$hole  my husband does for your kids like bathes feedings etc He earns a good wage and isnt mean   I will work when the kids get bigger|`|UcNdp3TSaa	Hmm I know this sounds really corny, but I cannot think of a single thing....My childhood was pretty awesome, my dad was a cameraman/photographer and took me and my sisters along to "help" sometimes which at the time, we thought was just the best thing in the world. Mum didn't work much, our house was always full of friends and family (my mums house is still like that) and we did a lot of "special" stuff - like going to see musicals and going 4WDing down sand dunes.....stuff I will try to do with my son as they are the clearest memories I have as a kid....we were never "spoilt", we had nice things but we were taught to look after them otherwise they would get broken or taken away....we had holidays, but always to caravan parks or hotels - never overseas - and we always drove.    My dad died a few years ago, before my son was born, and I desperately miss talking to him about all those memories and he had a wicked sense of humour which I miss too....    So in answer to the question, I can't think of anything off the top of my head that I would change....|`|x4uGfC4oaa	I won't be an alcoholic, and I will have more than one child. From personal experience, being an only child isn't fun.|`|AA10478146	I often felt resented.  My child will never be made to feel that way.|`|qbMCd2myaa	I want to be really open with my kid. I always felt nervous about telling my parents thing, i dont know why, i felt like they didnt tell me things i guess. I want my kid to feel like they can tell me everything, i want them to come home from school and tell me about the girl or boy they like and stuff like that.|`|1hsOl8Idaa	I work hard at being compassionate and caring. I listen to my kids. I talk to them. And make sure they have every chance to excel at what they like to do.     My parents lived their lives and I was along for the ride. Every decision was based on what they wanted, not what was best for their kids.     My mom was very hard, and unless you had a severed limb, she didn't want to hear you cry or complain about an injury!     I strive to find a middle ground of compassion and love to teaching a tough skin.|`|l4H81i7Naa	my parents always told me not to have sex. I was with my BF for 3 years when they found out I was pregnant. although my mom knew we were having sex it was hard to tell her I was pregnant. she knew I was going to marry the father. I wish she had talked a little more about coming to her with questions about birth control and stuff. schools do it too. when the talk about sex education the only talk about abstinence. lets be hon nest, lots of teens have sex and we need to know more about pregnancy prevention.
AA11783622	At the very least the guy ought to have his medical license removed, permanently.  He not only put the woman's life in danger, but with 8 babies, it is unlikely any of them will develop naturally, with no mental or physical problem.    As well, he himself ought to pay for their education, care, training for the rest of each of their lives.    This is fertility medicine gone horribly off course.  I'd never seek this doctor out as anyone trustworthy.    I cannot imagine what was on the guy's mind....certainly not the welfare of any child, nor any woman.|`|OU9xnW86aa	I think they didn't know that she already had 6 children.|`|AA10458750	I think that lady should have been at a psychiatrist & not a fertility center....|`|3gXQPso5aa	I don't think so he has poor judgement that is his job, and if that is what she wanted that is what he gave her. that is like doctors who give woman breast implants over and over again no matter how big her boobs already are if that is what she wants it is his job to give it too her as long as she knows the risk and he tells her he does not agree. it is her chioce and that is what she wanted I think she has poor judgement she is the one with 6 kids not him|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	He didnt think they would all take he was trying to ensure her pregnancy. No child born is a mistake|`|F4FJVq37aa	I do think it was poor judgment, but if i recall correctly the article i read said they implanted less but they split.|`|7ce4b4d4bd5516971418d113cb95d3e2aa	I think the woman used poor judgment.  It was the doctor's job to do what he was paid/asked to do.  also, he only implanted 4 and they split.|`|smeaC4SHaa	Pro-choice. It's the woman's choice to abort a child and it is also the woman's choice to bear more children. So yeah.     It is only wrong if the doctor 'forced' the woman to put 8 embryos in her.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I'd say she used poor judgement, not the doctor. Also, they did not implant that many eggs. They split, which happens often, causing her to be impregnated with eight. They offered her the procedure to remove some of the eggs, which they do whenever that many implant, but she refused. I don't know that it is up to the doctor to play moral police. He was just doing what he was getting paid to do.|`|97FYCsDiaa	While I believe that the woman is ultimately responsible for her health and the health and welfare of all 14 of her children, she does have willing participants in supporting this outcome.    A. It is any doctor's responsibility to screen patients for elective procedures, including fertility and cosmetic surgeries.  This can help determine a patient's mental and emotional health and their ability to manae the outcome of that procedure.    B. If the woman was seeking adoption of a child/ren, she would have to undergo an examination of her ability to be a parent- including a financial check, a home environment check, and determine what level of prior commitment she already has (i.e. 6 children who are cared for by her parents). So why wouldn't a fertility specialist be required to perfom the same type of checks?    Lastly, court documents have revealed that she declared bankruptcy prior to the fertility treatments. Since this is an elective procedure-- who paid for this treatment in the first place?!  Her family must have played some type of role in promoting this decision.    Someone needs to stop this insanity-- doctors must take an active role in determining the good of the patients and the patients' family. Based on the doc's lack of due diligence, I would agree that this is poor judgement at the very least.
c2d66e358522de8a7fced132cb693320aa	Babies like to suck on nipples and on their fingers. So, the typical pacifier is somewhere in between those two so it's easy for the baby to grip.    So yes, that's what they're "supposed" to look like. Their form is due to their function. Their designers aren't _trying_ to gross you out, I promise. :)|`|x4uGfC4oaa	They're supposed to resemble nipples. Babies, naturally, are supposed to be breast-fed. Bottles and pacifiers simulate that.    What should they look like, sharp spikes??|`|HM0cxcahaa	Supposedly designed based on nipples...but they have advanced them to be more "ergonomic" to assist with reducing reflux and colic, hence weird shapes|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I dunno but they have come a long way.     Check out these old bottles.    http://www.babybottle-museum.co.uk/galle...  Be sure to flip through the pages cause they get even more funky.|`|aqto0hJTaa	They're supposed to look like nipples because that's what babies are built to suck.
hl5WdXnbaa	It is kinda funny  how many people say no.... then I wonder if they turn around and watch Kate plus 8 or "the duggars" on TV.... or any other family reality TV show.... They are earning money from being on TV so why shouldn't this woman?  After all do you think Kate, Jon and kids would now have that nice million dollar home if they did not pimp their family out on TV?  No one  bashes Kate for taking drugs and having six that they could not afford either....even if she was married they still could not afford them...   I may not agree with it...but the media is going to be in her and her children's face anyways so why not make a few dollars from it? Maybe this money will help her so that she will not need public assistance. It is not the kids fault they have a crazy mom LOL so why not give them a chance to have a good life.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	well if I got octuplets I would be taking all the offers I could get and exploit those offers till the end. All the news and shows and magazines etc would have to pay me to be on them.. I dont have money to take care of that many kids so I compleatly understand why she would. Now I personally wont be giving her any money because it was her dum idea to insert all those eggs in her when she already had 6 at home but if some magazine wants to pay her ( or tv show) I dont care. She should get some help even though she is a dumas*, for the babies sake|`|5mlcMu0Kaa	She should NOT get any money from media sources or book deals.     This whole story so disgusting.  Unfortunately, she will probably receive taxpayer funded public assistance, and lots of it too.    She apparently was only thinking of herself and not the children and her parents.  I feel so sorry for those very precious 14 kids/babies, and her parents.  More sadly, these children are not being raised by a father.    I feel that laws should be in place to avoid in vitro method for a situation like this.    I feel Miss Suleman should give the 8 babies up for adoption.  There are so many loving parents who so badly want to have children, but cannot.|`|w4ZY0MKWaa	selfish,selfish,selfish   now we citizens have to pay to raise the children,  her parents filled for bankruptcy, lost their house not long ago and had to move in the house that they bought for their daughter|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I feel sorry for those babies and the six other kids, they don't have real father and the father's family to love and care for them. She purposely denied them half of their family. And her own mother is so overwhelmed that she sought counseling and decided to move out away from them, so there goes one more family member. The older kids will probably have to be involved in watching them when they become toddlers and probably won't get the right amount of attention for themselves. How about the mother sitting down with her children after school and discussing homework and other problems, will there be enough time in a day for each one? I will be surprised if some of them don't have development or other problems from being so small and premature. I've read that her 3 year old is autistic, and can't even imagine her taking care of these babies and dealing with an autistic toddler too.|`|S8RL9lieaa	There's another way to look at this. All the time she's got money coming in she won't be able to claim welfare benefits.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	That I worry for those kids.    And how she afforded this in the first place, after taking advantage of her parents.    And that I hope the one thing this does is bring to light the ethics of the fertility industry.  That clinics dont share or patent their secrets, in order to bring in as much cash as they can, and that couples feel they may need to implant so many, to increase their chances of success, when it can cause these multiples.  (Im not so sure on all 4 splittling)  Plus look at this huge hospital bill, totally discouraging insurance companies to ever want to cover treatments.|`|bSr3WeXNaa	She won't ever get a cent from me.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I think it was stupid of her to get pregnant with 8 babies after already having 6. She will get handouts from people because her 8 babies are the 2nd set to ever live...so she made history. She wasnt married....her mother is stating that she is obsessed with having children. I think she needs some damn mental help. If she did do this for the money thats pretty low to me...but i dont see how someone not married, living at home with mom...just needed to have more babies after already having 6. Oh well i dont have to take care of  them lol|`|t0mb150gaa	I think it is a very sad situation she is a single mother who already has 6 children and now has 8 more which will mean that not all of those children are going to get the one on one attention that children need to thrive. No i do not believe she should be getting any type of media support or financial support from anyone because she choose this for herself and did not think about how she was going to financially and emotionally support all these children. She is acting very selfishly and the children will be the ones who pay for her irresponsible behaviour.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I hope she doesn't get money for it. She chose to take the fertility drugs, that was her choice and she should be responsible.|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	Would have been nice to have a house, job, and partner first.|`|1OKx4TYpaa	I think it would be impossible for any person or couple to care for 8 newborn babies (many with special needs, I'm sure) at once.  It breaks my heart, but I really think these poor babies will endure some neglect.  I held my baby a lot because I think they need the closeness and feeling of security.  This cannot be done for 8 babies all at once.    I wish she would allow some, if not all, to be adopted by loving people.

Im a virgin til marriage so help me god|`|kouLTJBJaa	Teenagers are more likely to have sex, but preteens are less likely to be responsible about using protection. But statistics show that pregnancy is much more common in late teens.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	i doubt it. preteens have barely hit puberty while teens are almost through with it.    but that does not mean preteens should go out and have sex. not only are they not physically mature, theyre not emotionally mature either.|`|Tf19RETiaa	nope its more the other way around.|`|pJeFpC7qaa	Yes because 11 year olds have WAY more sex then 16 year olds|`|7RUqEJzLaa	I wouldn't think so. I would think 16 year olds are more likely to have sex then 11 year olds..
oUcLSDZ6aa	Absolutely raise the question of why you weren't informed, with the teacher, and the principal.     Unless the teacher is secretly a doctor as well, she shouldn't have been the one to decide whether or not he sees a doctor.     I would be royally peed off, and I would have raised hell immediately.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	FIRST talk to the teacher and just see what her attitude is and if she just make a HUMAN error.  If she is an a$$ then go higher up.  Take it by your instincts.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	you absolutely should've been called and he shouldve been given ice or a visit to the nurse or something.  go there and talk to the teacher and if you aren't satisfied go see the principal.|`|1hsOl8Idaa	Yes you need to march down to the principles office and demand a meeting. Take a picture of him if you can and the shirt too!     This would have me furious! He is so young! Maybe if he were a 5th grader, then its different!     Yes! They should have called you! He should have seen the nurse! He must have cut his lip on his lower teeth.     This is not acceptable! And you need to set ground rules now with the school so that they understand you are not a parent that will just stand by!|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	oh, poor little guy.  I would have expected at least the ice.  Maybe not so much a call.  Id just ask on their first aid, and notification policy - and if they dont have it, then be worried.|`|j2mRop0laa	You absolutely have to go in. If you don't they will assume you are one of those parents that will let them walk all over you and your child and neglect to tell you a thing in the future.  Anytime any little thing out of the ordinary happens, I go to the school and ask that the lines of communication be open as wide as can be. I want to everything that could potentially be a bad thing for my child.   Something like what you describe. Wow. I would go talk to the teacher and then to the principal and then the nurse. Letting each and every one know that I want to be contacted if he so much as skins his knees.   I'm at the school A LOT and let me tell you: The staff know which kids they can blow off and treat differently and which ones they better attend to, because some of us parents make a fuss.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	yes do it. I would be mad to.|`|aqto0hJTaa	I would be upset if I hadn't been contacted.  I understand that things happen, but don't let me be shocked by blood and a fat lip.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'd have some words with his teacher. She just ignored him...and his obvious injury.|`|ULxBUoclaa	well take it up with his school. i would be pissed. even if it was an "accident" i would consider asking the school to notify you whenever you son is injured (as in a blood and deep wounds) GOOD LUCK!!|`|mTTPLly4aa	you have the right to know|`|K7f3B4scaa	Uh yes, there is no reason they shouldn't have called you or given that baby some ice. The nerve of some people, especially teachers.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Yes, I think you should speak to the teacher about this.  Any sort of injury or altercation with an other child should be mentioned to parents.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	I would make a trip to the school. First, speak to the teacher and express your feelings. Then go to the Principal's office and make sure that they are aware of what happened and how you feel about it. Just in case something like this ever happens like this they know your feelings and have no excuse for not at least contacting you.|`|MpqNJ6sWaa	well to be honest id be dancing on the bloody spot, you trust these people to care for your child, if you had a child over to stay and he cut himself, ask yourself the question..would you ring his mum and let her know..yes of course you would, dont take it too lightly as they might take it as you are ok about whatever happens in future
uqG5WVbVaa	yes i never got a positive out of the 6 months i used a OPK so i started to think i wasn't ovulating and that got me really scared because i thought i would never get pregnant. but on january 13 2009 i got my BFP!!! i couldn't believe it. i read that an OPK can come out positive if your pregnant too so i tried it just for the hell of it to see if it would finally be positive and that was the first time i ever seen that little smiley face.|`|bcZSIphUaa	Hello there,    I have PCOS and TTC 1.    I'm not on clomid yet (I've just started on Metformin).    I'm planning to start clomid in a few months - if I don't have success with Metformin.    Are you taking Metformin in conjunction with Clomid?    I hope so because new research has shown how it drastically reduces miscarriage rate and also improves chances of conceiving by itself & with clomid.     I've attached some info about Metformin below in case you aren't on it yet...    I'm also wondering whether it is worth starting to use an OPK - just in case I happen to ovulate?|`|HM0cxcahaa	Might be your ovulating later or earlier, I ovulated on day 17 when i was using them
JvZY0ZS4aa	Of course having a loving, present father is so important for a boy and girl. When this isn't there however, you can have substitutes. My husband's parents divorced when he was 6. He only heard from his dad on special occasions and seldom saw him - he was not an active, present father at all.    When my husband turned 13 he got his first job at a small town candy store. The owner was a good fatherly man that took my husband under his wing and taught him many things. My husband worked there for many years, but eventually the owner encouraged him to pursue something better in life and encouraged him to get a degree and good job (a very important step a father needs to encourage his children in).    My husband continued on with his life and eventually started going to youth group where he very much looked up to the youth leader. That youth leader taught him important lessons on how to be a husband, good man and stand with godly values.    My husband has an exceptional work ethic, is kind and compassionate and an extremely loving and devoted father and husband. I give the credit to these two men in his life. He is no longer in contact with them, but they helped teach and shape him into the wonderful man he is. He's still in contact with his father from time to time (no hard feelings there, his dad is just not part of his life), but he had very little, if any impact on his life.    A good father is hard to find, but there are also many good men out there who have more than enough love and dedication to pour out to kids that are not their own. You'll likely find them in a church, youth group, charity organizations, youth clubs, etc|`|AkFag8tNaa	Both the father of my oldest and the father of my youngest (my husband) lost their fathers early on and are both good men.|`|oXrDKjkkaa	As a teacher for 31 years, I've seen many boys who HAVE fathers grow up to be just like dad - abusive woman haters.  I've also seen little guys with no dad grow up to be wonderful men.  It depends on the mother's attitude, as well as having other men in their lives - uncles, grandpas, friends - who are good men who take an interest in the child and show him the way.|`|wZAeBisbaa	He WILL become a man; that you can count on.  I would worry more about him growing up to be a person of good character and a responsible citizen.  This can be achieved with or without a father.  In an ideal world, every child would have two parents.  But the reality is that many do not, and it's often the dad who isn't there.  Most boys survive that and do just fine.      If you are the parent of that boy and are really concerned about it, give him opportunities to connect with men who will be positive role models and who will remain in his life for a while. Sports coaches, friends' fathers, and relatives such as uncles or grandfathers can serve well in this role.  If you can't find someone, consider signing him up for youth mentoring organizations such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters or maybe your local YMCA. Other community youth organizations may provide support for adolescent and teen boys without actually assigning mentors.|`|zrhrJQvtaa	I agree with what the person above me said. Sign him up for Big Brothers Big Sisters. It's a great organization.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	painfully. even if there is a father figure or an uncle etc that boy is missing out on a special relationship. That being said many men overcome that and become better for it in a way. Some do not and end up trying to find 'fatherly' guidance from wrong places. ( like gangs etc) . I would definately recommend big brothers etc so the boy can get a positive role model into his life.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Just because somebody doesn't have a father doesn't mean they can't grow up to be a "man". He will just have different experiences that will shape who he is in the future.
hWc65sEtaa	A baby heart starts to beat at 17 days after conception.  You just don't "hear" it until about 8 weeks along.  To me a fetus is considered a human when it heart starts beating, so 17 days after conception.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	At about 4-5 weeks gestation.  I heard my son's heartbeat at about 7 weeks.|`|l4H81i7Naa	we heard my sons at 3 weeks|`|abd8dd4fcfbbb00353f312ac986977fbaa	heard my son's at 3 weeks|`|Op32hmEtaa	well i'm not sure if i'm right but:    i think that when the cells start to form the first thing that's has to form is the heart, so after if forms it starts to beat and with that more heart cells form then other cells together and make the fetus|`|WrUTuQdlaa	12 weeks.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	From my experience I just got to hear my peanut's heartbeat when I was 14 weeks.

Thumbs down? Obviously from abortion supporters who dont want to acknowledge a fetus as a life. Do a little research, you may just learn something new.
aL4UoRdTaa	Public speaking is the number one fear in this country.  Death is number two.  LOL.  It is very normal.    As I see it there are two problems here.   One is talking in front of others  And the other is articulating yourself well, things not getting jumbled from the brain to the mouth.    I had both of these problems.  To help with both of them you really need practice.  I know it sounds simple but it really isn't.  I took a speech class which of course I didn't want to do because it is all speaking in front of the class.  It did help me.  Also the more confident you are in what you are saying the easier it is.  Maybe you can start by writing down what you want to say and then reading it aloud when called on.  It's good practice.  Also you can tell yourself that at least once a day you are going to try and talk in class (mix it up with different classes) or if that is too much maybe three times a week.  Speaking aloud alone can help significantly as well.  Read books aloud, give speeches in your room.    To help with articulating myself I took linguistics classes and learned greek root words.  I practiced speaking in front of others.  I wrote down my thoughts.  I expanded my vocabulary. I read more books (helps with vocab. and articulation).  It really is about being confident.  And the more knowledge the better.  If there are particular things that interest you then read up on those topics and you will be so confident you know what you are saying it'll be easier.  The hard part then comes when people try and argue with you.  Ugh.  That is another step to learn how to deal with.    Confidence in yourself is important.  You can develop confidence in other aspects of your life.  Sports, Friends, Family, Hobbies.  The more confidence you have in yourself the better.  And the easier these problems will become.    Also something often overlooked that can make a big difference is your health.  Eat protein during the day and get enough sleep.  Drink water.  If you aren't physically healthy it can really make you more nervous and muck things up in the body.  Also fish oil pills help the brain function better.    Edit to Add: I saw that looking at teacher makes you nervous. note that not all cultures require eye contact as much as the typical american culture.  practice speaking without making eye contact.  and practice eye contact without speaking.  it might take a long time to mix the two together.  some people never learn to mix the two because of the culture they are from.    Hope this helps!  Good Luck!|`|Uthlx2IWaa	first off. Breath! thats very important, and will help you alot.|`|TpJbtJCfaa	you aren't alone, a LOT of people have this problem.|`|IxGa7mnGaa	I used to be like that too, in fact I'm still kind of like that, it's natural to be nervous to speak publicly. When you're up there, look over people's heads as apposed to their face, or look at the teacher/a friend to make you feel more comfortable. Also when you are answering a question, just relax take a deep breath and remember that no one is really listening, half the class is probably dosing off or not paying attention, just give the best answer you can and it will reflect in your mark that's all that matters.|`|pgdNUFt1aa	just look them in the eye and remember: you are better than them, so nothing to worry about!|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Try talking to your teachers about this problem and maybe they'll allow you to present things only to them; not the entire class. Also meet with a speech/language pathologist and see what the actual problem is. It could just be nerves though. Good luck ?|`|rpU209Xfaa	i do the same thing and i am your age{{16}} and in the 11th grade...  what i do is try to take a deep breath in and just relax myself...  when that doesn't work, i drink hot tea...  it both relaxes your body and gives you peace at mind...  and when all comes to all, i just get up there and mumble and studer until i'm done with my presentation...  but i have learned trusting my classmates helps me feel more secure and calm...|`|pqZAhBLvaa	In school, I used to write in point form what I wanted to say before I answered. It helps a lot!|`|Ic6YekeWaa	I was the same way. The only thing you can really do is to try not to be nervous. Focus on something other than your classmates. I used to read aloud to myself and tried to slow down and not stutter. As you get older you'll break out of the shyness, but its all about being comfortable with yourself|`|qJOOq93zaa	Hii :)    It's okay, just don't listen to what people say or you'll never succeed in life. And this isn't that bad, many people have this problem. Just be yourself and foerget about this. You'll get over it soon and it will be all over. But if you're really worried then, get it checked by a doctor. Good Luck my friend ^-^    Hope that helped :)|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	start practicing in front of a mirror and/or your parents.  for your next presentation, practice your words in front of the mirror.  practice maintaining eye contact with the audience. then do the same presentation for your parents and ask them for constructive criticism.  don't be offended or embarrassed by their suggestions.  just take it for what they say and work on what's suggested.    as for being called on in class, when you're studying at home talk out some of the material to yourself.  do it until the topic makes senses in your head and sounds intelligible coming out of your mouth.    you won't be able to avoid public speaking at all.  it'll come up in school, college, work etc.  good thing you noticed and want to fix it.  that's more than i can say for most 16 yrs olds these days.  good luck to you.|`|hHZtlqQmaa	i have this too. try and slow down and think what you are saying and don't be embarrassed  and that's tha main thing. no one is better that you. this should sole it. this is what my mum told me and im not too bad now. hope this helps|`|KUgzImePaa	i understand what you are talking about i do the same thing.well you can boost your self confidence by wearing something you look good in when you go up in front of the class.like a pair of jeans that you think looks good on you so you can feel good when going up there.or you can just look at the teacher when you are talking and ignore everyone else.if you cant look at the teacher then focus on something in front of your face like a poster or the wall.i hope this helped you.|`|K7f3B4scaa	Sounds to me like you have Social Anxiety. I have it my self. I went through my whole life having this problem but I finally went to the doctor and described my symptoms and problems and they prescribed something to help me. Maybe you should talk to your parents and let them know whats going on.|`|d67c7dc2486e90e8c6c91365dfdf1eacaa	You have to have self confidence , which lets you believe in your self without caring what others think as long as your right ...   stay focused and try repeating the answer in your head about 3 times before you ask , or write a quick note [ the note of what your asking can be initials , just something quick to help you remebmer your question ].    & If the teacher says something for ex like  dogs eat food .    ask the teacher   what kind of food.    and he or she would say good question ..    which means your intrested in learning more about the subject ...  but that was just an ex,
S1gJJHNzaa	well it takes 2-3 months for swimmers to mature so my guess would be 2-3 months.    have you considered IUI, it's only $200-$500 and it helps when men have swimmer problems..    I am getting ready to go back on clomid and this time have a trigger shot and an IUI.. the trigger will make me ovulate all the mature eggs and the IUI puts my hubbys swimmers directly in my uterus.    here's a great website with lots of ladies ttc, http://www.twoweekwait.com

The Sleepy Wrap is especially good for small babies and even though it looks confusing once you put it on a couple of times it's easy as cake.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Car seats - I have a Britax Marathon and a Graco Nautilus.  I love both of these seats.    High chairs - well we have the fisher price rainforest chair.  I have mixed emotions about it.  It's easy to clean, but the stupid wheels on the chair always get screwed up and annoy the crap out of me.    Slings - I didn't use slings, sadly.  I wish I would have though.|`|png0sxZnaa	Ebay shops all the way as long as the stuff is new x|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, ToysRUs' BabiesRUs, diapers.com and Target are good becuase they have ratings on the products and what they offer is usually available locally.   Diapers.com also has free shipping on orders over $50 in the continental US.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	britax marathon or boulevard  chicco candy  baby bjorn with lumbar support|`|u3to2Y4Qaa	I just got a Graco Nautilus car seat.  My son is 2 and this is a great seat!  I have a friend who works for a police department and is certified in car seat installation and she recommended it.  The big plus with this seat is the 5 point harness works up to 60 lbs which is the safest way to travel.      I added a link for the seat.  I would look around cuz the price seems to vary from $140-$180.  I know there are other good makes out there like Britax, but I felt the Graco met my needs and I liked the price.
qGQCLFinaa	i say if she's friends with any of his friends..... ask them to pass on a message or to find out if he's interested. OR, if she knows his e-mail address or is on my space or something & he is too she could send him a message & ask him..... she has a 50/50 chance he'll say yes, & i'm sure there are lots of boys that would love to go, i say muster up all your courage & make that first step.  Don't be afraid of rejection!  I wish her the best of luck!!|`|kZ2xRHrMaa	Just hint about it. If not hint, say 'hey save me a dance!' =]|`|W8cf9Dxjaa	ask him :)|`|pPc2kZfwaa	TELL HER TO GO FOR IT. ITS A SIMPLE ANSWER IT YES OR NO. IF HE SAYS NO. THAT JUST MEANS HE S NOT IN TO HER.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	i would have her tell her friends to spreed the word that she really wants to go with him so he will hear it and if he likes her then he will ask|`|yIHlvPFfaa	If she wants to go with him, then she should do the asking because if she just waits around for him to ask her he might not. So she should just ask him and then she can have the chance of going with him or starting to look for another date if he says no. Don't wait around, ask him.|`|QR6IHIZxaa	Hmm.. well does he like her?   does she talk to him alot, or hangout with him?   is she friends with him?   does she show that she likes him in any way?   if she doesnt then tell her to do all that :]|`|2qsbDj7Aaa	just push her in his direction|`|rFMRgHTdaa	she should tell one of her friends to ask hi if he is asking anyone and suggest to ask her.
oGHtaaCkaa	The more that you think about it the more worked up you'll probably be, unless you find it easier to maybe plan out what you're going to talk about, but i doubt that since you probably won't know any of the questions they'll be asking...  Just try to be calm and relaxed throughout the day. Get plenty of rest so you don't feel jittery or drained.|`|katIlecuaa	abuse him/her? right back!!!|`|uy6sBhipaa	Think this. After you tell her everything and deal with it the hellish nightmare you've been going through for so long will be gone.  Your mind will be free and you will laugh and be happy. There is a downside though. When the stress lines leave you face and the sadness leaves your eyes you are going to look ever younger and everyone will think you are 12. Except me, of course. I'll think you're 13. hehe. You'd better be laughing here.  Be strong.  8~)|`|2qsbDj7Aaa	just stay cool, let everything out, sexual abuse is a serious topic though, so if you cry then so be it, cry. there is no law against crying. you are only human. good luck and i hope you get the help you need|`|bkOn30I1aa	Well just think that counselors are there to help you, and if you are going is because you want to talk to him (her) right?? They are usually pretty good at listening and they are not judgmental so you can relax and just talk and express yourself. Dont worry about it, you will be fine.|`|gkeuj7JYaa	you dont need to stay calm, they are there to help! kids go in there everyday with their problems and talk to them and im sure theyll be happy to  help and im postitive theyll understand why your crying or not calmm|`|ztzEloj5aa	Try breathing techniques or meditating to relax - taking walks also helps clear the mind cuz you dont have the distractions of everything familiar around you.|`|VkvhtD4daa	do not worry it will all be over|`|HGPo06Zyaa	try and stay calm even though it might be hard.   Think about only a little bit about whatyou want to say right before you  go in so you know how to start, after that just let it go, they are there to help, so cry if you feel like your going to, dont hold anything. thats just going to make it worse. go in pretend like she doesnt know ( yes that will e hard) and go on through iut your day, and when the time comes, RELAXX  drink lots of waterr to.|`|mweM8qoKaa	Let it all out now.  Don't let it take you down in front of people who you don't wanna seem weak in front of.  That way they won't have to catch you, because they won't see you fall.  But let it out to your therapist, that's part of their job.  Goodluck(:|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	Go to school a half hour early and go to her office. That way the worst is over with and your not freaking out all day.|`|siif0K84aa	Think of something else to keep it off your mind for as long as you can, like a song stuck in your head or homework.|`|Q1PczvzKaa	Ok you can either    Think about it ahead of time and plan what your gonna say    or    not think about it    Just do what it easier for you  Also im sorry you have to go to therapy for abuse  all the best =D
T8ksKCWCaa	Your cervix is larger than normal, as well as full of blood vessels. These can be easily damaged by being poked, by either the baby, or during intercourse, or even brisk walking.<br>  Of course, you should call the doctor because all bleeding during pregnancy must be reported just in case.

SlBsJ3NRaa	Because many other cultures still believe women should be submissive to their husbands, therefore many foreign women are willing to take a lot of crap to ensure her family stays together. American women are taught to be assertive and to think for themselves, therefore are willing to put up with way less from their spouse. It's a combination between culture and the difference in the ways we are raised.|`|1OKx4TYpaa	American-born women simply won't take much crap from jerks, foreign or domestic, that's why!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Probably just the way our culture is|`|cAtWxJG1aa	where do you get those statistics?    http://www.divorcereform.org/nyt05.html
HqOkC2YHaa	All the time! I have this winnie the pooh tree thingy and when I play with her with it I stand her up so she can play with the top of the tree but when I let her on the floor she just screams at the trunk cus she can't reach the entertaining part    or when she's super tired and things that usually fit in her mouth like her rings or linkadoos don't seem to make it in because she's holding onto them wrong she bashes them into her head until she drops them and then gets upset she dropped them lol    Or my fav when she's playing in her exersaucer and shes looking at her toys on the ground she gets all super excited and jumps like crazy with her arms out and then cries because she's stuck|`|n6XYYyoLaa	yeah, she has one of those balls that roll around  on their own; and if it gets away from her she gets really mad at it...|`|zwctZ812aa	Lol my son has started yelling at his toys in the last week.  It's so cute.  My boyfriend was doing dishes the other day and I was playing with him on his mat while he screamed at his toys and my boyfriend was like don't just let him cry, pick him up if he's tired of it. lol...he isn't around enough during the day to realize his new habit.  I thought it was funny.|`|mB8Q3iXqaa	Yes. My babby does this too!    Interesting. I use toys to end my frustration.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Yes this is normal and very funny.
wOyyZjY0aa	Hello.  I just jumped on to an online ovulation calendar and if you last period was 1-16 and you have a 28 day cycle your approx. fertile window will be 1-26 through 1-31.  But it looks like you did the BD on pretty good days.    I would suggest setting up a free account with an online ovulation calendar.  You simply put your period dates in there and it will let you know your approx. fertile days.  It's been pretty helpful.  Best of luck!!!|`|DnyyyGeEaa	Sometimes those days dont work because your body can change all the time. The best plan is to pick a month and seriously do it everyday! Alot of work, but hey your burning calories and enjoying yourself. Good luck! It will work!|`|m3oA5xLYaa	just log onto a ovulation calendar and put your answers in. It will be  a lot easier to understand and a lot more accurate if you use that instead of us!|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	don't do it every day, every other day then the sperm is better quality, also tell your partner to wear boxer, loose underwear and not to sit on anything hot... it will increase your chances!|`|pqZAhBLvaa	You would have ovulated around January 30, so the most fertile days would have been January 26 to February 3...aka TODAY!

Think about it:  why did god let this kid go missing in the first place?  And doesn't he know she's missing and her family wants her back?  I'm sure her parents are working with the police, and if they need volunteers to put up posters or if they organize searches, you could help by doing that.    I hope they find her.  I can't imagine what her parents must be going through.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Course. Hope she is found safe|`|pqZAhBLvaa	I'll be thinking of her. Don't get too freaked out yet though.

mB8Q3iXqaa	I just left my little one alone with it. He's had it since his grandparents came to visit for Thanksgiving.    I think it looks neat.|`|bcf4e052d6ee36211c2e498220198fddaa	It won't hurt your baby, but it looks horrible and will take months to go away by itself.    The way to get rid of it: get some baby oil and gently massage it into the affected area.  Get a very soft bristled baby brush and brush it out.  Brush gently and take your time - the baby oil will help loosen the dead skin.  Do this right before you plan to bathe your baby, so you can wash out the baby oil right afterward.    It'll take a few times, but you'll be able to make most of it go away. This is strictly for your benefit - your baby won't care one way or the other - but you really don't want to have to look at that Cradle Crap.  Another alternative is to just get some cute baby caps.  Hope that helps.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	If it moves to the face or ears, moisturize like you've never moisturized before! As for the head, if it is not weepy or anything, just try to resist the urge to pick at it. If it is weepy, or looks painful, try mineral oil to moisturize (not baby oil, it has perfune). Good luck!|`|jJxUCkkFaa	consult a medical doctor for best answer!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well i didn't like the looks of it , so i followed my docs advice;   put baby oil on head, let sit; i put a hat on to keep it from making a mess; thirty mins later , use a soft toothbrush to loosen the scales; wash baby's hair, use the toothbrush gently again with the shampoo....i have never seen any other flakes....when i was her head now, i still use the soft toothbrush, but only as prevention....worked like a charm and i only had to do it once..|`|0rpN2419aa	You don't really really need to treat it, but if you want the easiest and cheapest way is to brush the babies hair to loosen the cradle cap before you wash it.  After you wash it you can apply a little baby oil, but it is nothing serious and most babie's do have it.  Congratulations on your new little hug a bunch!  Babies are so much fun!|`|fHjSonssaa	You're supposed to just use a soft baby brush and comb to gently lift the flakes off the scalp.  You can also put a little baby oil on then to soften them and left them.  You don't need to use the few over the counter items they have for it-  the only reason you would need to consult a DR is if the flakes start to get really thick and won't lift off the scalp- then they will use something else to treat it.  If they won't left, they can scab and make the scalp bleed when you try to remove them.    Otherwise- it should clear up on it's own.  You can also put a baby cap on the head (as long as baby isn't too warm)- the moisture will help.      My son had a little cradle cap and I got this info from a specialist at Gillette Children's.  It's generally harmless and quite common.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	lightly brish the scalp with a baby brush before shampooing.  this will loosen the excess sebum.|`|YAwvszITaa	it will go away itself soon leave it alone|`|ZWB0OvTXaa	craddle cap will go away on its own...its different for each baby in the time it takes. you can get a soft brush while you are bathing your baby...put some soap on his/her head and brush with one of those really soft baby brushes...this can loosen up the craddle cap. but there is really no reason to do anything for it, it doesnt hurt the baby and it will go away eventually.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	No. No reason to treat it its harmless to them.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	that's fine it doesn't bother them it's dandruff for babies....it just makes your baby look ugly because his head is scaly and yellow|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	it's harmless, and I don't think it bothers them..  it bothers the parents more I think.  My baby had it, and I used a soft toothbrush when I washed his hair.  That did the trick.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	*lol* I haven't seen them, but be thankful you live in Europe (I assume from the brand and your spelling).    I still get formula ads for babies less than 6 months in Canada and from the US media.  The US ones get to imply that their formula is "just like breastmilk".    Have you seen the pampers "one bag = one vaccine" which has somehow crossed the line into "buy our product or you are killing babies"?    And the cheerios make kids smarter, and some bread can't remember those were 6+ months ago.|`|x647LeB2aa	I think I'd rather whip him up a nice spinach smoothie :)    Seriously though, at one years old a baby is eating baked beans, canned fish such as sardines, ordinary breakfast cereals, wholemeal bread, green veggies - all this is enough to give them the 6.9mg of iron they need a day.  Growing up milk is yet another rip-off for the baby market.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	lol, I know someone who still buys it for their 3 year old - because she refuses cow's milk now. Probably because they never pushed it. They're a lovely couple but they'v more money than sense.  Then they worry that she won't eat anything? I wonder why!  It's a waste of money, as long as they get a good varied diet, they don't even technically need cow's milk. I know an 18 month old who has to get all her calcium from other dairy products as she hates milk.  Bloody advertisers...  ADD - I just thought - did you see the one the had for 'child insurance'??? Insure your child, if they die you'll feel bad you didn't. Honest to God, it was life insurance for children, and a total guilt trip.|`|eb91bb1a478986b1687a1a29cf093937aa	as a breastfeeding councillor this advert and also the glossy adverts you see make me made!!!    if you think to all cow and gate adverts have you ever seen a specific advert for stage 1 milk? this is because it is illegel to advertise it so the corporations heavily adverts all there other produces because research show that if we hear a memorable brand we will actively look at that product line its a subconscious reaction.    this is why they have made a follow on range so they can hit an advertising market without tr yin to deal with legal red tape    also when a mother is in maternity after having here baby she is given a selection of choice of which formula she wants to feed her baby if she chooses not to breastfeed     which in itsself is free advertising    its all about profits and showing mothers that you can waste money on something that is not a need if you really dont want to give a child dairy cow milk then why not swicth to goat milk which is a much small crud for a child to digest    if people think then this is rant i do appoligize but i thought that i would share my insight into this matter|`|oScgvcjaaa	its a load  of crap ....    i wouldn't waste my money|`|M6c0hUefaa	Well, I haven't seen that ad, not sure where you're from, but in the US they have those "Go and Grow" formulas aimed at kids from a year on that are really just nonsense..I was talking to my pedicatrician about that the other day and she explained to me that the macro nutrients from formula are really only needed in the first year when solids are the main staple in their diets, so as long as your child is eating, there's absolutely no need in all that. Just a marketing plot to get parents more worried about something, so they can sell, sell, sell.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Don't you find that many "baby" products are like this.  New parents are endlessly bombarded with tat on very cleverly worded commercials.    They are worded in such a way as they might start to wonder if their babies can cope without it - I shouldn't worry, I think most parents would see through this scheme!|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	well,i'm not a mum,but i think if you have the money why not,..........as i say..to people giving me the thumbs down...NOT to buy it,but to those who have money to throw away why not,we spend it on ourselves with cosmetics and vitamins etc!|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Had a conversation with my partner last night after this advert came on, he asked if I thought we should be giving her that milk instead (because she's over 1 and drinks whole milk now), so it definately sucked him in. I think its very misleadin and a lot of parents will start to worry that their children are not getting enough iron!|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	I think it is rubbish and trying to make mums feel bad for not giving their child the "growing up milk". I'm in two minds to give it to my daughter when she is one, but then again I think I might just put her on good old whole cows milk. My mum did it with me, and all my siblings, nothing wrong with us. My mum also breast-fed my baby sister till she was 3 (didn't bf the rest of us though, personally my lil sis it the lucky one!)    I too am sure that our tots will be healthy enough with cows milk/ breast milk or formula.    P.s Love your new pic! He is such a handsome little fella!|`|723QHuicaa	I bought that milk lol    But, I bought it because my LO wouldnt drink cows milk - no way, no how. We tried everything.    I used to have her on aptamil formula, but the aptamil growing up milk does not come in a powder form, only prepared which was getting expensive to buy a big prepared bottle, and throw half of it away.    It wouldnt have bothered me too much, but she didnt drink much water or juice through the day. So I bought the C&G Toddler milk. Purely because formula was the only thing at that point she would really drink, and because it was cheaper than buying aptamil.|`|O8XjkCjxaa	It's rubbish! And too much iron's bad for you.|`|AA12019574	rubbish , do it the old fashioned way , give the child good food and it will grow up well     above is right about iron|`|dnG7fhnbaa	I'm not a mum for another 23 weeks and that's exactly what I thought when I saw that ad for the first time today! x|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	Just another ploy to part you from your money.A good healthy diet will give a baby all the nutrients they need.|`|OCgZACJqaa	There is nothing wrong with giving your children normal straight forward milk from the supermarket.  Things are expensive enough without having to buy special foods and milk for children that can now eat the food their parents have.  If parents are not sure their children are getting enough vitamins, they can get drops from the Health Centre for about 50p per bottle and sometimes they are free if they are on benefits.
cA3DDRGraa	Maybe his bladder is not developing as fast as he is. My step son wet the bed until he was 13, it was quite annoying. His mother took him to the doctor but I can not honestly tell you what was said or what they did for him. You could also try taking him to a chiropractor to see if they can help him.<br>  <br>  gram|`|AA11593134	have you tried to pee and stop in the middle? You can't! That's why it gets soaked (especially for a 11 year old = more pee)... <br>  Also, when you wet the bed, you're dreaming that you are in the toilet/bath room peeing for real. So they would pee all the way and not just pee just a trickle or half way.<br>  And i believe you are asking if it is normal for an 11 year-old to wet? No, not really... Try talking to him what was he dreaming about, etc...|`|CxCigxZIaa	Normal:<br>  Just watch his fluid intake 2 hours before SLEEP time (not bedtime)<br>  Also time to wake him up and make him go. Always (I'm sure you know this) he needs to go before bedtime. After he's been asleep for about 2 hours you need to wake him and make him go.|`|UgZq1pXjaa	Might be time to switch from goodnites to a small/youth adult diaper.  The goodnites are probably not as absorb ant as you need it to be and a youth diaper will be.|`|TK03jZTuaa	Yep. it is inconvenient but that's what happens. Make sure you don't reprimand him for it but at this age he is old enough to be responsible for his actions. Therefore, he should change his sheets and put his wet washing on. <br>  <br>  when he finds it enough of an inconvenience this will aid in him stopping this habbit. I know it isn't voluntary but helping make it inconveinent really does play a part.|`|546002402354e9578d6e24307bab333baa	My son has this problem, also 11. I have eliminated drinking after 6pm. He goes to bed at 8pm and goes to the bathroom before he lies down. It has almost stopped any wetting accidents at night. Have you thought about a urine infection?|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I am not sure if its "normal", but it happens to some children.  To avoid your son wetting the bed, you should try eliminating water before bed, or take him to a homepathic doctor.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	It's likely not a behavioral issue, he could have a more serious problem.  There may be something wrong with his bladder or who knows what else.  This happens to some kids, but it is not normal.  You should get his doctor to check him out since there could be something more seriously wrong with him and the doctor can pinpoint the cause and work out ways with you to make it stop.  Good luck!
GGH0HVdvaa	catch it under a pot and set it free outside|`|G2auAv1Saa	You should quit tying reality to what you see in movies.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	cute until it multiplies with thousands of babies and the poop that carries diseases gets in your cabinets.. or your floor... have fun|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Catch it with a cage trap. Use some really good cheese at bait. You may feel bad,but mice can carry diseases. And when there's one,there's usually more where he came from.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	oh yeah...maybe you can get in a suit to and and solve crimes with him...you guys could be PARTNERS!! Ahh the fun you will have!!|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	ok........|`|Qydtjz2naa	I had that same problem with a chipmunk that lived under my couch! Expect for I wasn't worried it might have nightly adventures, I just don't want to kill anything.  I was home alone when I saw it, so I took an empty tissue box and put some peanut butter in it.  That did nothing, and I wasted a lot of peanut butter, so don't do that.      You could try to chase it and trap it, but that didn't work for me either.  It just ended in many screams and falling off of chairs.     I would recommend leaving the back door open for a while, and hope it runs out.  That's what I did and it worked. Or you can get those mice traps that only trap it, and don't kill it.  Then once you have it you can let it go outside.  I would try to get it out fast, they creep me out.  And once I left my homework on the ground, and I found a lovely little chipmunk present on it...|`|AA10531094	Sure, make a tiny trench coat and hat for it.  lol|`|b5kw4znQaa	idk is it an adolescent mouse?|`|7RUqEJzLaa	You don't know where it's been.. since you think it solves crimes and wears suits then it might as well have wings, right?|`|IHw2qUtcaa	A tad bored or do you watch too much tv?|`|5MfZncDSaa	haha it doesnt make any sense... they bring diseases and they are sooo uglyyyyy.. i would kill it immediately...|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	get a live trap, bait it, then when the mouse gets caught, throw a towel over the cage, pick it up, put it in your car, and take the mouse out to a country area.|`|oP8krEBiaa	lol, you should catch it under a bowl or pot and let it free in the woods.
GDobAMQ8aa	The female orgasm makes the uterus contract, but it's the sperm from the male that is considered what's important when attempting an induction via sex.    A membrane sweep is nothing like sex, unless your partner has somehow wound up inside of your cervix.|`|no9N3zjMaa	It hasn't done me a bit of good Yeah that's what they doctors will tell you but the baby isn't going to come until he/she's ready and Nature does it that way for a reason. I know it sucks I'm right there with you (also carrying a baby that is 4 weeks big measuring 8+ pounds)|`|kprKXEOSaa	DO NOT  try to sweep your own membranes!  That is reaching into your vagina, into the cervix, and trying to touch the amniotic sac.  There are a lot of germs on your hands and under your nails, even after you wash them.  Very bad idea.  I know how miserable those last few weeks are, but really, just let the baby come when he or she is ready.|`|Qz3sii2caa	Sex and masturbation feel good. Membrane sweeps do not. Also, I wouldn't recommend your sex partner do your membrane sweep, go to your doctor for that.
rdpZrBc9aa	Your dates seem to be a little confused.  If your last period started on the 2nd of January, wait a few days and test again.  It's still possible you could be pregnant, but there might not have been enough hcg in your urine to show up yet.      What was your normal cycle length before you went on the pill?  Everybody's cycle is 28 days on the pill, unless they have no periods at all.  Now that you're off, your cycle should return to what is normal for you.      It does sound like you might be pregnant.  Test again in a week or so, if you can stand to wait that long, and be sure to use your first morning urine.    Good luck.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	you could try a different test, but the pull out method, while not totally effective, drastically reduces your risk of pregnancy, but you need ot use condoms! the breast tenderness could just be that you're about to have your period, and well, headaches happen. if you were pregnant, a test should have shown it, but sometimes false negetives happen, buy another test and use it first thing in the morning, the first time you pee, if it still shows negetive and you dont get your period in a week, make a doc appt for a blood pregnancy test|`|hoX7hoINaa	Your last period was the 2-8/9 of January. Today is only the 3rd of Feb. Give it until the 8/9 of this month and then test.|`|fTvVEMVtaa	try to take another pregnancy test in a week or so.  so it's not to soon or to late.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	With the pregnancy test, you may not have enough of the hormone in your system when you tested. Best time is of course, first thing in the morning. I would wait a week, test again, if by then nothing, go to your doctor|`|r9WhvImaaa	Its too early to test for the pregnancy yet as the hormone needed to detect it will not be present.    Wait another week then retake the test    Good luck|`|2ylrOGUdaa	I would wait about week or so and take one of the First Response tests, they are very accurate. Your breasts could be tender because you are about to get your period and that could also be causing the headaches. However those are both signs of pregnancy.|`|6OAl3it1aa	DONT USE THE PULLOUT METHOD.
DdjpQr0Gaa	I love Aryana, but not Angel.  I think its been used enough already.  Try a diffrent middle name|`|9DpbUdKcaa	I really like the first name, the middle name sounds good with it but if it were me, i would choose a different middle name.|`|cVY7xjg2aa	i like it :)|`|ndvSK783aa	I like Aryana, My friend spelled hers Arionna. with the middle name it doesn't flow together. They say not to have the name end in a vowel and the middle name start with one. That it doesn't flow together. But other than that I like both the names!|`|c3CVY87caa	I would like it better if it was Aryanna Angelle (pronounced an-hell, almost spanish-like)|`|MW1yrHbOaa	idk, i don't like the angel part|`|glGVuKAEaa	Arianna is really pretty, how about that spelling?

I have a friend who just named her daughter Aryana the same spelling too.|`|JXXZIsBvaa	I like Aryana(not really the spelling I like it Ariana)  And I like Angel...but for a boy.|`|39pl2Dotaa	i love it  whats the last name   that matters A LOT|`|khXzNl6Iaa	i think its Cute!|`|3paE1E9Xaa	im sorry i hate the name|`|ycjhPITiaa	I like it. I think that it is very pretty, but I would change the spelling to Ariana because it might be easier for her to spell when she is little, and it may be easier for her teachers and her elders to pronounce it.

EEf01zA9aa	Dont ask dont get|`|jZ6Ptkafaa	if you have the box and the receipt you can always try|`|zD2NWrIzaa	take it back with receipt and ask them|`|rIzx4OEWaa	I would normally say no it is to late but now days trade being so poor I think you should give it a try. Just tell them you Son has only just received it as a late christmas present an that you have noticed that when he plays with it you have noticed those problems an feel it is unsafe an not suitable for the purpose it was bought for. As it is a health an safety issue of a child they will most likely help you out so long as you still have the receipt for the item. but they may only give you an exchange, if they don't contact the trading standards about the item an see if they can help you an your local paper, they love to help in these issues.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	I haven't checked...however, Fisher Price might not have a complaints department, but look at any Fisher Price toy and search for a 1800 number.  They will be able to help you out (I do a LOT of emailing, calling, writing companies, whether it be praise or complaint...firm believer in customer feedback).    Also, do try and take it back to the store with the receipt.  Big stores are pretty good at returns without question.  Smaller stores are big on customer service and the consumer is always right!|`|PkEhRA8Uaa	You can take anything back to Argos,if you have the receipt you will get your money back if you don't have a receipt you will get a credit note to spend in the shop.If you want to make a proper complaint about the product write to Fisher Price the address should be on the box.|`|My79YBjhaa	for Xmas gifts, i'm guessing Argos would honor a return for a full refund within 30 days. since it has been longer, you might struggle to get a refund. however, i would approach Argos by telephone and talk to customer services and see what they can do. once you explain the issue to them, they should honor the return and let you trade the gift in for one that is more suitable. you must be confident when you are speaking with customer service, if they get wind of any weakness on your behalf, the rep will know they can bully you into backing off. but if you stand your ground, speak professionally, they should be able to document the problem and record it so that when you go to the store to exchange, the in store returns personnel can look up the details and handle the exchange for you. try getting the issue resolved by phone with Argos with a follow up attendance at the store to deal with an exchange. in the current climate especially, Argos will not want to lose existing customers and should be willing to accommodate an exchange at the very least.|`|50lIaC8zaa	yeah you could try other than that you could try contacting mattel as they are part of fisher price (in some way) here are some details i found    http://service.mattel.com/uk/contact.asp      hope it helps :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	call the store and ask for the manager and explain what u said here...if that doesnt work, u can look up contact info for fisher price and call them directly...i have heard they are easy to deal with..|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	If you have the receipt I would take it back and ask to exchange it or something at least not sure about your money back.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Well...I don't work in Argos but if somebody took that toy back to the shop where I work I'd refund them immediately and take their details then call Fisherprice and tell them the problem, giving them the customers details so they could talk to the customer themselves...But I work in a shop that's only really big across Yorkshire and is renowned for its customer service.    Hopefully Argos will at the very least take it back...really it depends on which member of staff you get...Good luck! x|`|OCgZACJqaa	Argos are great, they are very helpful, just take it back (with the receipt) and they will exchange it for you, no problem.  Tell them what the matter is as they will definitely need to know.

I have never, ever had a problem with Argos.|`|Omixzxe9aa	argos only operate a no quibble guarantee if an item is faulty.if it takes a battery open the compartment and snip the wire then it is faulty and you will have no problem .but otherwise no they wont change it|`|QOvUS6xVaa	i would contact every number fisher price has dont let him play with it anymore and keep trying , to avoid other babys from having the same injury
2LflHv23aa	The babies r us that I go to have them for $1.09 for a 2 pack. The walmart around me sells them for $1.04 a 2 pack. Target sells them for $.99 a 2 pack.   I personally stock up on the baby food when it is on sale and I have a coupon.   Also I have alternated between fruit and veggie. This was the order I used for my boy.   Apple  Carrots  Banana  Peas  Peach  Squash  Pears  Sweet potatoes  Some people say if you start a fruit first they wont like veggies. My son loves his veggies.   If you sign up through the Gerber website they will send you coupons in the mail every couple of months or so.|`|Yba724Wkaa	walmart  veggies first|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I bet wal mat.

44OH7Si6aa	I have a baby bjorn diaper bag that was very pricey, but it was a shower gift. I can highly recommend it, it has been perfect and is about to go through baby  3 and still in pristine condition  However, if you are looking to save money, try not getting a diaper bag. Take a look at the diaper bags in your local stores, but also go look at their backpacks. Many guys prefer the backpacks because they aren't as feminine and many times backpacks are designed a bit sturdier than diaper bags.  You want it to be spacious, but you also need some good compartments to store things in that you may need to access in a hurry such as wipes, bottles,  or spit up rags. If the bag is too big though you tend to accumulate too much in it and have a hard tiem finding things, just make sure you clear it out often and keep clutter in there to a minimum so it's easiest to use.  You want it to close. I have seen so many models now that have just a flap that flops over the top, the problem is when the bag falls over it's going to spill some of it's contents, and that gets annoying plus you risk losing something you need. You also want to be able to get into in a hurry though so a zipper isn't always best, look for snapp closures or velcro.  Look for sturdy fabrics that won't tear or rip easily and can be easily cleaned with a cloth, clear plastic protective outerlayers are wonderful.  Take a look at the straps of the bag, make sure they are wide enough and won't slide off your shoulder when it is loaded down. Styles that have insulated bottle pockets are great to have.  Hope that helps and good luck with your little one.|`|AA12127418	babys r us has good ones and they are not that expensive|`|CoSdW7xQaa	Try burlington coat factory, they have really good diaper bags there  and very sturdy and inexpensive too!|`|PYfgtJBmaa	Target :)|`|1dueLOdvaa	I've always liked the back pack diaper bags.

Also, it has this great feature that you can easily snap in to any stroller so it doesn't drag on the ground and you don't have to stuff it into the bottom basket of the stroller. It's amazing.. This is my diaper bag... I got it at babiesrus...     http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...|`|lKsIKKm2aa	I love my skip hop duo diaper bag I bought online...one of my favorite things about it is how it connects to the stroller nicely:) lots of pockets/zippers for mommies things. You should google the bags and take a look:)|`|dde8ee0158b3da0fb4d185658f2c094faa	I got a sugerbooger by ore bag and love it! It's a neutral color, has a fold out changing pad, and is big enough for flights home. All my girlfriends that are having  2 want one. I received a couple other diaper bags as gifts, but I can't get over this one enough to use another!|`|7gde2DRraa	I got a simple black one from Babies R Us for everyday use.  Its a pretty good quality one and it cost about $40.  I also splurged on a really nice one for going out from Buy Buy Baby.  It cost me $150 but its beautiful and I like to use it for when I'm dressed up.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Well congratulations on your soon to be bundle of joy!    For a diaper sack I am not going to lie, I got a very expensive bag that was not meant for diapers per se, but I saw such potential in it. It is large and black lambskin and leather (very easy to wipe off). There are 2 pockets on the left and right side of the bag, they are HUGE which is great, and they dont look like cargo pockets, they blend in with the bag. On the inside there is a place for the cell and a zip pocket. Everything else is open which leaves me plenty of room for wipes, diapers, and a changer outfit. The bag is called The Poppy bag, and it is a Mulberry (its probably on sale now!!!). This thing is holding up soooo well its unbelievable.     As for what I would want in a bag whether I was spending loads of money or not it would be this:    outside pockets  large interior  neutral color  NOTHING with a silly print (whinnie the poo, etc)  expandable (my bag has zippers on the side that make the bag expand & contract with the pull of a zipper)  comfy on the arm (you will be carrying this thing everywhere for years)  easy to wipe (throw up, poop, milk, etc. will probably get on it from time to time)    A good place to find is macys (they are always having a sale) , target ,and surprisingly babies r us has a pretty cool selection (the 1 in manhattan)    If you have to spend a little more than you anticipated think of it like this, if you divide the number of days you'll be using the bag by how much it cost it's worth it :-). Also, keep in mind that it doesnt have to be a bag that is specifically for diapers    Good luck and congrats again|`|AykczQleaa	I have a very good one from Target.  Its basic Red and black.  It has plenty of pouches and pockets, plus the diaper mat thing.  Its great, and it was only 34.99|`|Def3uk2aaa	I just got one at toys r us on sale.  It's not HUGE, a nice size.  has a couple bottle holders, room for a change pad, receiving blanket, extra clothes and diapers.  Came with a little pouch to put dirty diapers in if i need to, and a flat wipes case that fits in the bottom.  Nice neutral colours so my husband isn't embarrassed to carry it!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	We have a few but one of the best ones was from BRU - it is a Columbia Messenger bag.  Was only $30 or so and has lasted.  Lots of good pockets too.
BTuFtui3aa	It's been awhile since I've read the book, but as I recall, the "Other Family" was really just a twisting of the child's own-- not really different people. I would see less of an adoption analogy, and more of an analogy to growing up and seeing that your parents are human, with flaws and good points... just in this case the flaws are represented in a frightening alternate reality.     Coraline doesn't actually get different parents-- she comes to see her own parents differently through her experiences with their frightening alternate versions. That's just shown in a stylized way rather than a realistic way.    Gaiman's work tends to do that-- split people into their good and bad sides, and represent them as separate entities. For example, see Good Helena and Bad Helena in Mirrormask... they're fairly clearly actually one person split in two.     Mirrormask also does the "child being kidnapped by evil alternate parent" thing, and again, I don't think adoption is intended, so much as the duality of the soul, since the Dark Queen attempts to replace her own lost child, one version of Helena, with the other version. There isn't a non-Helena child involved, just like Coraline doesn't have a separate set of parents.    Actually, if you're looking for an adoption theme in Gaiman, there's a MUCH better example. Check out Stardust. Though Tristan is raised by his biological father, he's relinquished to his father's sole custody by his mother because his life is in danger. Later on in the story he reconnects with his mother, and it's happy and joyous. For a story of how a mother missed and loved her lost child for many years, you'll do well with Stardust.    Both Coraline and Mirrormask are too stylized to be taken as a realistic representation of adoption, and are focused more on the good and bad dual nature of every person.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I was wondering the same thing.     But I don't think it directly deals with adoption. I do know that part of the plot is Coraline going to live with her "other mother" in an alternate reality. The longer she is with this "other mother" she sees how ugly she really is.|`|nOsbhtGYaa	I don't think it's specifically adoption related, but there could be some underlying similarities.  I haven't heard if Tim Burton has any ties to adoption, but I'd be curious about the book's author.|`|c2d66e358522de8a7fced132cb693320aa	It's based closely on the book by Neil Gaiman. It doesn't have an adoption theme, in my opinion, even though Coraline has an alternate set of parents in the flipside-reality.     Basically the Other Parents are trying to tempt Coraline into staying -- the Other Mother is essentially a predator at heart that only looks like Coraline's mother superficially.    Of course anyone could choose to read an adoption theme into it, but judging by Gaiman's other work he wouldn't be secretly preaching about adoption, pro or con. It's not really a book about about parenting, it's about the child's maturity and choices.|`|F4eXU83qaa	no it doesn't. i may be wrong, but her parents are her parents in the real world and then she has her "Other Mother" in the dreamland|`|OYG8vWhSaa	No, there is no adoption theme. It's about a little girl who finds a door into another world but finds that it's not all it cracked up to be. There is an overtone that one should appreciate what one has, but no adoption theme. GOOD book, though.|`|87naw1BOaa	Coraline was a book, but the movie is so different they consider it to not be like the book at all.     And for those who keep saying Coraline by Tim Burton, YOUR WRONG! Its Henry Selick!    Every one says Tim Burton because it says the directer of the nightmare before Christmas, Tim Burton is PRODUCER!     GET IT RIGHT! OBVIOUSLY YOUR NOT TRULY A FAN OF TIM BURTON IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT!|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Sly,    I wondered the same thing at first. It's the "other mother" thing that threw me.    I don't think that adoption is an actual or conscious theme in either the book or the movie, but I can see how there could possible be some parallels or applications of the story to an adoption situation.    From what I know about the author, he does not have any direct ties to adoption but I believe some of his good friends are adoptees/APs but I don't think adoption topics or references are necessarily/purposely addressed or reflected in his body of work.     But, since I don't actually know the guy, I could be totally wrong.    http://www.neilgaiman.com/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Coraline is actually based on a book with the same title.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	The film is about a young girl, Coraline (Dakota Fanning), who unlocks a mysterious door in her new home and enters into a parallel reality, a fantastical and thrilling imitation of her own dull life. In this world, Coraline finds a new versions of her real mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman), her off-kilter neighbors Miss Forcible (Dawn French), Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Mr. Bobinsky (Ian MacShane). However, this other world soon begins to unravel and Coraline, along with her real parents, become prisoners to her Other Mother and must count on her resourcefulness, determination, and bravery to get back home.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	A description of "The Other Mother":    The Other Mother or Beldam  The creature that created the 'Other' world for her own entertainment. She is almost identical to Coraline's real mother but taller and thinner, with long black hair that seems to move by itself, black button eyes, paper-white skin, and too-long, twitchy fingers with long dark red nails. She cannot create, but only copy, twist and change things from the real world when constructing her version of it. She collects children, whom she quickly becomes bored or frustrated with, after which she imprisons them behind a magical mirror and slowly sucks the life from them; she intends to do the same with Coraline. She is referred to several times as "the beldam".     It's touted as a horror/fantasy film and the author is known for his comic books.  It doesn't sound like it has an adoption theme, but I guess we'll have to read the book.
Jswomud7aa	You can ask your doctor to prescribe a oral medication called Reglan to help you with your supply     (I'm not sure if the Dr can prescribe it to you or not because of how long you've already been breast feeding, but it doesn't hurt to ask)    Stay in bed for the next 2-3 days with your son and just breast feed him constantly. It's all about supply and demand. If he demands more, you will produce more. Drink at least 16 8oz cups of water per day, I know that's a lot, but in order to increase your supply you will need it.    Beer always gave my breast milk a boost when I was running low. There's also fenugreek. You can get it in a alcohol (more absorbent) tincture and put one full tincture in a cup of hot mother's milk tea. Take 3 cups of that per day.    If you do this all in the next few days I'm sure you'll be able to catch back up    EDIT: Make sure you are eating enough as well. I lost my breast milk because I wasn't intaking enough calories to continue producing breast milk. EAT EAT EAT!!|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	go to a doctor|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	what makes you think it's drying up? it doesn't just dry up out of nowhere. stop giving pediasure and a ton of solids and his nursing should bring it back up- the more you nurse the more you will make- he doens't need baby food - give him table food. nurse more and make more- you don't have to feel full to have enuogh milk or even pump a lot|`|4AO2myzKaa	Experiment with different types of baby food - homemade, organic, name brand, etc.  It may just be a trial and error thing to find ourt what he likes.  As long as he's not fussing from lack of nutrients, you are likely giving him enough.  If he starts fussing, and refuses to eat in general I'd take him to the doc as he may be coming down with something.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Why do you believe your milk is drying up?  If baby has been nursing all along, the milk does not just 'dry up.'  If you have been pumping often, or are pregnant, it IS possible that your supply is dropping.    In any case, the solution is the same -- nurse more and/or pump more.  Milk is made on a supply/demand basis, and the more milk is removed from the breast, the more milk you will make.     As for solids, if he doesn't like babyfood, then just offer table foods.      (BTW, do not give him Pediasure.  It's not intended for babies under 12 months.)|`|Btsctjydaa	Find additional boobs.

I use domperidone.  I don't know if you can start it late...I started it at birth.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	What makes you think your milk is drying up?  Its highly unlikely that if baby isn't taking bottles, formula, juice or large amounts of baby food that mom's milk supply will suddenly stop being able to keep up with demand at 9 months unless mom has developed a serious underlying illness like low thyroid, diabetes, or anemia.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...  Is your milk supply really low?    First of all, is your milk supply really low? Often, mothers think that their milk supply is low when it really isn't. If your baby is gaining weight well on breastmilk alone, then you do not have a problem with milk supply.  It's important to note that the feel of the breast, the behavior of your baby, the frequency of nursing, the sensation of let-down, or the amount you pump are not valid ways to determine if you have enough milk for your baby.    What if you're not quite sure about baby's current weight gain (perhaps baby hasn't had a weight check lately)? If baby is having an adequate number of wet and dirty diapers then the following things do NOT mean that you have a low milk supply:        * Your baby nurses frequently. Breastmilk is digested quickly (usually in 1.5-2 hours), so breastfed babies need to eat more often than formula-fed babies. Many babies have a strong need to suck. Also, babies often need continuous contact with mom in order to feel secure. All these things are normal, and you cannot spoil your baby by meeting these needs.      * Your baby suddenly increases the frequency and/or length of nursings. This is often a growth spurt. The baby nurses more (this usually lasts a few days to a week), which increases your milk supply. Don't offer baby supplements when this happens: supplementing will inform your body that the baby doesn't need the extra milk, and your supply will drop.      * Your baby nurses more often and is fussy in the evening.      * Your baby doesn't nurse as long as she did previously. As babies get older and better at nursing, they become more efficient at extracting milk.      * Your baby is fussy. Many babies have a fussy time of day - often in the evening. Some babies are fussy much of the time. This can have many reasons, and sometimes the fussiness goes away before you find the reason.      * Your baby guzzles down a bottle of formula or expressed milk after nursing. Many babies will willingly take a bottle even after they have a full feeding at the breast. Read more here from board-certified lactation consultant Kathy Kuhn about why baby may do this and how this can affect milk supply. Of course, if you regularly supplement baby after nursing, your milk supply will drop (see below).      * Your breasts don't leak milk, or only leak a little, or stop leaking. Leaking has nothing to do with your milk supply. It often stops after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.      * Your breasts suddenly seem softer. Again, this normally happens after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.      * You never feel a let-down sensation, or it doesn't seem as strong as before. Some women never feel a let-down. This has nothing to do with milk supply.      * You get very little or no milk when you pump. The amount of milk that you can pump is not an accurate measure of your milk supply. A baby with a healthy suck milks your breast much more efficiently than any pump. Also, pumping is an acquired skill (different than nursing), and can be very dependent on the type of pump. Some women who have abundant milk supplies are unable to get any milk when they pump. In addition, it is very common and normal for pumping output to decrease over time.|`|nLsYH6pmaa	Call your OBGYN and tell them to prescribe to you REGLAN Right NOW..  This has been perscribed for stomach situations but the side effect of this drug is it increases production of breast milk.  I'm on it right now.  I did something stupid and almost dried up my milk at 4 months!  I did all my reasearch and found out about it.  In the mean while pump like a mad woman because it takes about 72 hours for the drug to get into your system.  I know your fear!!  It will get you through the home stretch.  But do it now!!  And a good thing...it is not expensive.  About $14. I'm not kidding.  Call your doctor first and tell them to call it in for you...if they won't for some reason, call your peditrition -  They will for sure!  Then go on the internet and look it up just to get an idea of what it is.....

qsjGSXaRaa	I've heard about that happening when there are other monitors in close proximity to your own, like at a neighbor's home.    I just got a camera monitor to keep a close eye on my baby and I'm hoping some other person's baby doesn't come up in the picture!! Now that would be freaky! (I've heard about this happening!)|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Its caused by interference.     Our neighbor one house over had a similar baby monitor for there son, and we would be able to hear their son cry on our monitor at times.  We ended up switching for a cheaper monitor that didn't pick up as much signal.   Even a CB can interere with the signals.   No need to be scared, pretty common with baby monitors.    A CB, its a radio, like what truckers use,  lol.  Police officers also have radios like CBs that can even interfere.  Interferance can happen from all sorts of things.|`|JP2h62qiaa	You are picking up signals from peoples CB radios and from cordless house phones.

nqR7CQ4gaa	Yes, at the very beginning of pregnancy, they are quite similar, only much more exaggerated when you are pregnant.

SCY0bOr5aa	Come to a comprise that you both can agree on. Explain that you are ready for a family, how do you feel about this? Set a plan of when you both want to start trying to make the family happen. Babies will always be expensive its apart of having a little one in your life. You both however have to be on the same page or there could be serious problems.    It took my Husband 4 years to marry me. We did not foresee kids in our future at that time and we have 3.|`|AA11404742	How would you feel if someone committed you to a cause or project for the next 25 years, without asking you first?    It's normal to be apprehensive.  Having a baby is a huge undertaking, and it's very expensive.  Just the cost of diapers and daycare will be as expensive as the monthly payments for a new car.    So sit down with your husband, and make a plan.  Find the likely costs you'll face - daycare, food, diapers, formula, clothes, furniture, etc.  Look at the bills you have now, and see which ones you can pay off in the next year.  Save enough money so that you can stop working for at least 6 months if you have to.  Be sure your job and his are secure for the reasonable future, and that at least one of you has a job that provides medical benefits and insurance.  And make a budget so that you can see your way to make this happen.      It might take a couple of years before you can be ready for this.  That's OK - you have time to enjoy each other's company, and to make all the preparations you can to make sure your baby has a wonderful, welcoming home.    In the meantime, I have 2 other recommendations:  First - DON"T buy a crib, changing table, etc, until you're about 6 months pregnant.  Having an empty crib sitting around will only depress you.    Second, get a cat.  This will give you something to play with and cuddle, and if people ask when you're planning on starting a family, trot out the cat, and tell them you're practicing with her first.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Of course you should care!  He's your husband.  Create a plan, together.  You may need to compromise, but you have to talk about it, and come up with a decision together.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	You need to ask yourself, would you prefer a baby in year or so when your both ready and willing or now and risk losing your husband and ending up bringing the baby up on your own!    I know how you feel about wanting a baby and your husband not being ready... but it is much better for your child to be brought into the world with two consenting adults. Write out a money list of all your income and expenditures and try and work out how much a baby would cost etc, then go through it with your husband, maybe he just needs a little reassurance.    But I would definately not get pregnant on purpose with his 100% full support!!!|`|MtC3CWZraa	This is something my husband and I talked about all through our dating years so we both knew what the other needed in order to feel ready.     When those needs had been met, we again talked about the subject to make sure we both wanted it.     It wouldn't be a good thing for your relationship for you to make such a huge decision for the both of you without his input. Think about how you would feel if you were in his shoes and your spouse did such a thing to you.|`|gx4s68s8aa	no you shouldn't go on with your plans to have a baby.  Before you got married this is really something that the two of you should have made a plan for.  I mean having children is a huge issue in a marriage and both people need to be on the same page for a marriage to work when it comes to children.    But sit down with him.  Tell him that you want children.  Then give him a timetable- 2 years, 4 year whatever.  And say that you want children by then or you need to consider whether this marriage was the right thing to do.  You didn't say how old you were, so it is rather hard to give advice.  The exact advice that I would give if you were 26 is different then if you where 36.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	Yes you should. Partner support can make it or break it for you.

It helps him everytime about 2 hours later.|`|qStmw7qgaa	How old? I'm having the same issue.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	This depends - how old is your baby, and has he/she had a change in diet lately? Also - have there been plenty of wet diapers?    *Edit  Hi! At 8 months it is normal for the stool to become for shapely and hard - almost like Play-doh (just not the same pretty colours!). This is because of the change in diet. Sometimes you'll see firm long poops, sometimes rabbit pellets, sometimes mushy-wushy ones! This is because of the baby's new foods, development and the related changing flora of his excretory system (the chemical makeup starts to change when the foods ingested start to change).    You'll probably notice the variance, too, when he has days when he eats more versus when he eats less and when he eats lots of formula or breast milk. Babies at 8 months are still fairly inconsistent with their eating (sometimes it's great, sometimes it spit out in a flurry of drooly raspberries!). You'll also see changing colours; you get lovely orange with sweet potatoes and carrots, and beiges and browns more with beef and pasta and cereals.    As long as his diapers are still wet and he can handle the firmness when his bowels move, he's just fine!|`|AA10526033	yea talk to your dr to get their opinion on what to do. its constpation not dehydration. some say karo syrup some say no. at 8 months my dr said juice. hes not drinking cows milk or anything is he?|`|R0EsQapRaa	My daughter is a little over 7 months old and has the same problem....every day.  I find that feeding her prunes fixes that problem every time.  Of course, be prepared for some real "blow outs"!  I usually give her some prunes if several days have gone by with hard stools.  PS - I give her the whole container of prunes.  She loves them!  I would also advise only giving the baby prunes in the morning, so there aren't any messes in the middle of the night.|`|2arZOZWgaa	This happens when your baby starts solid foods. As long as he is eating normally and has the normal number of wet diapers he is most likely not dehydrated.

If you're way too groggy in the mornings and have a really hard time functioning, you might want to get to bed sooner and make sure you eat some kind of breakfast every morning. I always make sure I sleep at least 8 hours a night.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? They need AT LEAST 8 hours of sleep. ??|`|hFVPEkWjaa	well i'm 15 and i'm home 4 a little while now so i go to sleep all 2:00 am to 12:00 that's cool wit me|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	About 8 hours.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	8 hours is standard. I have always been the type of person to need more sleep. At that age, if I didn't get about 10 hours a night, I'd be dead tired the next day. So it's up to the individual person if you need more...8 hours is good if you feel rested enough.|`|2qsbDj7Aaa	i say alteast 5-6 hours|`|d67c7dc2486e90e8c6c91365dfdf1eacaa	lets jus say the more you sleep , the more you grow but if you feel comfortable at the sched you are , then thats okayy . but try sleeping earlier to see if you feel even better .|`|zN8mKq66aa	I think the advice was that most people should get at least 8 hours.  But this doesn't apply to everyone.  I'm 15 and i never get enough as i should do.  I think it changes for everyone just get as much as you feel you need.    Hoped this helped.|`|PeZLCMgBaa	lol thats basically what i do every morning, unless i need to get up for like homework, straightening hair...    i personally do sports 6 times a week so i should be getting more sleep. if you do stuff like that you might want to get more sleep.     they say 8 hours a night is average. if your falling asleep in class you should try and get 1 to 2 more hours|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	about 6-8 hours is enough sleep.  it's normal to want to snooze.  i'm 30 and still do it.  as long as you're getting a restful sleep then you're fine.  if you find that you're tired during the day then maybe you need more rest, exercise or vitamins.
40Ggy4Doaa	I think if  the test showed once positive result then it means she is pregnant..and than she should go to the doctor and do a blood test.i know some woman who took about 6 pregnancy tests and half was positive and half was negative..so i wish you both good luck and in my opinion  she is pregnant..|`|26A1Q3eqaa	i would def see a doctor and be sure if you get more than one positive test i would say she's pregnant but a blood test would confirm 100%|`|AA12127418	i would take her to the doctor they can do a blood test and find out for sure|`|70b5377e6bed0f4df989015f91982f76aa	Buy one of those that say pregnant or not pregnant...that might clear up some confusion. Also, you might have to wait a bit longer to get a nice dark positive line result. The equate brand sucks anyway!!    I had very slight positive when I found out and it turned out that I ovulated a little later than usual so my dates were about 2 weeks off. That could be part of the problem too. If she just ovulated a week before the test it could take a while to get a positive result. Good Luck!|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Take her to the doctor.|`|Jswomud7aa	There are more false negatives than false positives.     More than likely she is actually pregnant, especially because 2 out of 3 tests were positive.    Good luck |`|RPszYGXkaa	I had this happen to me in Oct 08...2 positives, then all negatives.  My period did start a few days later.  My doctor said it was a chemical pregnancy, where they embryo doesn't have time to attach.  I would have her call the dr for a blood test to be 100% sure.  best wishes.|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	Sounds like she may have miscarried, I would take her to a doctor and have her hcg levels checked.
bkOn30I1aa	If two of them came out positive, it is because the test detected the pregnancy hormone, so most likely yes, she is pregnant. If you want she can also go to a planned parenthood and they can tell you for sure if she is or not.  Good luck|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	positive test, then a negative test, believe the positive one. Grats!|`|VZaqk5CYaa	a false positive pretty much doesnt happen. i know this from the 1st time i got pregnant. and thats what my dr said. but false negatives are very common. the test might not be as sensitive, or not taken correctly. Go to the dr and get a blood test - thats your best bet.|`|NLTnazU4aa	The best thing to do is go to the doctor and get a blood test which is the most accurate.|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	Your fiancee could be pregnant. She should definatley go see a doctor and get a blood test to confirm. Please keep in mind that in the first weeks of pregnancy, the hCG hormone doubles every day. So it is possible that she was pregnant (possibly a chemical pregnancy) and that she miscarried. (This has happened to me twice). Best of luck to you!|`|kL5f4Pn9aa	You've asked this question about 10 times now. And you've chosen a best answer on almost all of them now.. Please stop submitting the same question If you have already received the answer you wanted.|`|E9F6qjRWaa	possibly  just wait about 2 more days and test again   the brand doesnt matter they all work about the same  good luck  baby dust to you guys
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Demitri is a well known greek Name,and there is nothing wrong with it..|`|c3CVY87caa	yes, but only if spelled Dimitri|`|i2V17yi4aa	i dont like Demitri i like Dmitro (its my brothers name so i like it:)and as a nick name we call him "d" or in ukie "dima")|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I love the name and I sure wouldn't name a girl Demitri!!|`|Elxuvon8aa	no use the full name Demetrius|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Not that spelling - Dmitri - but I like Dmitro better.  Demetrius is awesome!|`|JXXZIsBvaa	No|`|khXzNl6Iaa	negative!|`|lXE75yQjaa	Big ol no..sorry.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Dmitri is ok but it is supposed to be spelled that way.  Demetrius or Demeter would be your better decision by far though.|`|d3BZlRyhaa	I love the name, but for a girl.....  I had liked Demitri Jordan for a girl  now i like Demetria Violet    but Demitri will work for a boy
Wd7ujHNhaa	You could be.  I am sorry for your loss...I just went through a miscarriage also and am currently in my 2ww.  I am sending alot of Love, Hope, Luck and Baby Dust to you!!!!|`|s519vyP5aa	sorry for you lost am not sure but lots of baby dust to you     listen to my story .. WELL ... 4 days ago i had a dream were the only thing i saw a the test and a positive line came up so i took a test yesterday morning and i got a faint positive were i had to look hard to find it BUT it was there so this morning i took another one yes the positive line was darker then yesterday i didn't have to look hard it was there so to make sure i got a clear blue digital test and took it about 2 hours later and for sure i got a prego in the window.. the thing here is that my period is not due till 02/10/09 but then again 3 positive test there can't be a mistake ...good luck and lots of baby dust ..|`|obN6p3Cgaa	sorry for you lost.I wish you better luck next time.
QBpJxWCmaa	our mind and body can play tricks on us when we are nervous.  Cramping and all sorts of things.  What I would do if I were you would be pick up a decent pregnancy test and test first thing in the morning with your first pee.  That contains the highest levels of the hormons we release when pregnant.  It should be able to tell by now!! Good luck!!|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would almost say your chances are a 5 on a scale 1-10. I would wait your period should be here any day now. I would take a test if your don't get it by the 9th.|`|hrEQXFdYaa	You obviously have a chance of being pregnant but your in a sticky situation because whenever someone stops taking bc pills it takes a while for your body to adjust....in that time you can experience pms and pregnancy symptoms which can mean something or nothing at all.. my sister went off birth control and add a period for three months striaght and wretching cramps. the pull out method is ALOT better than not at all.|`|hoX7hoINaa	The only thing you can do is test. It might be too soon right now considering the dates of unprotected sex, so next week take a test. If still nothing, try again a few days later.|`|m4nDQcWQaa	95%...|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Very high chance. Pulling out is not effective at preventing pregnancy whatsoever, you might as well just have finished up.|`|0TrvUZPGaa	IM in the same situation i had my last period on the 2nd of january and i came of the pill a month ago i took a test today but it came back not pregnant but i still haven't got my period i hope you the get the answer you want best of luck xx|`|b0XiSgIbaa	theres a pretty good chance, because sperm can come out before he ejaculates (before he pulled out sperm could have come). maybe not though, best bet is a pregnancy test.|`|5looQMxiaa	100%....|`|99tkN3qVaa	i wouldn't worry too bad yet after you go off birth control your period can be irregular. also i would wait until the middle of this month before investing in a pregnancy test. Wait until around the 14th or 15th because you could get it next week.
G2auAv1Saa	Yes, and we had to go get the switch ourselves.     *we learned quick a little tiny one you think won't hurt hurts a lot more than the big one*|`|k7FD3rt5aa	No, thank goodness!!       ^_^|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Yes, had to pick our own...  And it better not have been from an old, dead tree either!    = )    My daddy would sometimes cut the limb so it only had three leaves on the end of it!|`|bmoCpcdraa	yes and also shoes but those were the days|`|e8yt5PrGaa	yes ..but my mom and dad got it more with a switch than i did|`|EMKuBql8aa	Yep, my dad used switches and a snake skin belt on me.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I'm 21 and all I can say is that hurts like a mother. Leaves a lovely red mark, too.    My kids get  swat through clothes, and people say that's bad. Let's give them our families and show them REAL hard discipline.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	never, we were definitely spanked as children (my brothers more than myself) but we were never spanked with a switch. My mother did threaten us with a wooden spoon weekly though. She never actually hit us with it though. It seemed that it always broke on the counter as she was trying to prove how scary she was. I look back now and think that maybe i shouldn't have laughed at her after she broke it but it was pretty funny|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Yes I have and I have the scars to prove it. Being a Native child in a catholic school was not fun. They may have closed down the residential schools in the early 80's but the local schools were still all catholic determined to "tame us savages". The nuns would tell us we are animals and should be treated as such. A switch was a popular tool for punishing when they kept you after school... the famous ruler was in class.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Whats a switch? We were spanked with a wooden spoon a few times and once we were really bad and got spanked with one of those paddles that have the ball attached! Mostly we were swatted with a hand though and only until we were around 6 and could understand and talk things out!   Edit- I live in wisconsin so our bush limbs are frozen for most of the year maybe that is why I did not know what it was lol. I have heard of it before but I thought it was just another name for a whip. The wooden spoon thing was passed down in my family from my grandparents when they still lived in germany I dont know if that could have anything to do with it! But yeah the wooden spoon hurt alot!|`|9erSLvYMaa	Yeah, I got the switch quite a lot as a kid. I can't quite remember if I ever had to pick it out myself though (if I did it would have only been a few times since my mom kept a switch up on a bookshelf).     Anyway, yeah, those things stung like hell. And for the person who was asking what a switch is (probably a yankee), a switch is a snapped branch you get off a small bush or tree. Usually they're somewhat flexible so that they function like stiff whips.    Also, I find it funny that so some people have mentioned getting spanked with a big wooden spoon. I always thought that it was just my mom who did that lol. And for the record that thing hurt a lot more than the switch.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	I haven't but see a boy who was about 12 get disciplined with one, when I was growing up.

kiAQi91laa	There is always a chance of getting pregnant when having unprotected sex.  Since you have been on birth control for so long your period may take a long time to be more rhythmic.      The best thing for you to do is take an actual pregnancy test.  There is about a 60% chance that bicornuate uterus can hold babies full term.  If a woman is pregnant with a bicornuate uterus then there is a chance she may deliver the baby early too.  If you are pregnant the best thing to do is to see a doctor because you'll be considered to be high risk.    Relax and try not to stress out too much because extra stress won't help things any better.  I was given a 50% chance that my current baby will be a miscarriage and I have less than 7 weeks until her delivery date (c-section).
7HzfgRmwaa	I was 18 weeks and 6 days! I felt a "pop" Like someone popped their bubble gum against my insides! It was sooo cute! I NEVER felt these bubbles or flutters... lol. Just little pops that got stronger and stronger! Maybe your little bub is moving his or her leg/arm or body across you instead of just giving you a firm jabbing :) Lol! Enjoy it! They only get better!|`|cu3jnrq1aa	It didn't feel like "flutters" or "bubbles" for me, either.  But I knew without a doubt that it was my baby moving around.  I still can't explain the feeling, but it was unlike anything I had ever felt.  Trust your motherly instincts, and enjoy every movement!!|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	yes it felt like little tickles for me too...i remember i would be driving and i was about 18 wks along and i could feel him moving and i would just start laughing because it felt so weird!|`|N6XTcGejaa	you feel like something is moving around in your stomach. its a heavenly feeling.|`|70b5377e6bed0f4df989015f91982f76aa	I don't know if you can explain the feeling...you just kinda know. I just remember feeling him and thinking, wow that was him. I just knew.|`|e3042dec83cf9a787a90ebb833a298e9aa	This is my 1st too, at the end of 18 beginning of 19 weeks, I started feeling movement, but no one else could feel yet. Now, I am 28 weeks everyone can feel and Baby Boy is definitely active and kicking around. Just give the baby a Little more time.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	It felt like gas and it just rumbles around in your stomach.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Movements feel different all the time.  I felt what you're feeling, and also little bubbles. It just depends on what position the baby is in.
BoD0LCaeaa	why dont you just go out to eat at a restaurant...   or like throw a vegas theme ??!|`|SpcYCBndaa	1-Have a Hawaiian Luau. Leis and grass skirts.     2-Have a masquerade party. Have all the kids dress up like a nursery rhyme character or their favorite super hero.        3-Clue anyone? Make it a mystery party. Send out invitations inviting all detectives to the scene of the crime (they should wear their detective clothes and bring magnifying glasses. Announce at the beginning of the party things that have disappeared, then leave clues around, and watch the little detectives solve the mystery. You get the idea. Use your imagination.     4-A toga party.     5-A beach attire party. If its summer, outside is perfect, little wading pools or slip-n-slides, bathing suits, beach balls,umbrellas, sand and shovels, sun glasses make a great party favor (be sure to bring sun block). If it's winter, you can still have a beach party. Place beach towels on the floor, sun lamps, beach party music, hot dogs, and beach attire. Use your imagination!     6-Tea party.     7-Puppet show.     8-Skating party on the patio, perhaps put cones out. (don't forget safety gear!)     9-Slumber party. (all girls or all boys)     10-Dance party. Strobe light or ball, music, food and fun! Contest, prizes, fun songs like the hokey pokey.     11-Make over party. This one's just for girls, they take turns getting a make over from one or two moms. Hair, makeup, play dresses, then they have to model for the rest.     12-Water balloon party. Summer party, water fights.     13-CD party. This is probably for the 8 to 14 year old age group. Announce in the invitations: only CD's for presents.     14-Pastry party. Tons of snacks! Eclairs, jelly donuts, glazed, chocolate, cinnamon rolls, lemon filled, pies, and cakes!     15-Dinner party.(for ages 10 to 16) A more sophisticated party. Dress up for dinner, napkins, silverware, fine china and crystal (red punch in wine glasses is always fun), salad, followed by a three to five course meal, served by a servant or butler, dressed the part, ending in a smashing dessert.     16-Bazarre party. Give out tickets, have games such as bean bag toss, pie toss(whipped or shaving cream on tin pie plates), watermelon or ice cream eating contest.     17-Ice cream party. Chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup, bananas, cherries, nuts, sprinkles, gummy bears, chocolate chips, cookies, many flavors of ice cream, hot fudge.     18-Tent party/camp out party. Ghost stories, flash lights, tons of snacks, sleeping bags, water jugs, maybe even a campfire, weiner or marshmellow roast     19-Special friend party. (ages 3 to 7 or 8) Indicate on the invitation each guest is to bring their special friend, a doll or stuffed animal perhaps. They can introduce their special friend.     20-Pet party. Self explanatory, just be sure to have it outside! And have plenty of dog food, water to go around and a couple of pooper scoopers!|`|cPIYUWxyaa	I had a Hollywood theme and it was a sleepover and all the girls brought fancy dresses. 1st we made a short movie there were two groups by the way then while 1 group does the movie the other does a spa type thing after that every one grabs a partner and you have so much time to do each others hair and everyone votes on who's they think is the best. then every one gets into there fancy dresses and you go get ice cream when you get back everyone watches the movie and you give out awards like best actor best line and so forth and we had a keira knightley cut out and we got  Hollywood wall paper stuff. i had a lot of fun hope it helps|`|a0b92cae95987cb4dc17fc62fe26e83faa	If she is very mature, do something grown up.  Go out for say dinner and drinks (fake cocktails, of course) then find a good movie, or go back home and rent a few movies and do a spa night in, facials, manicure etc. and have a fun slumber party. Theme, girls night out.
BxrU8kUJaa	The majority of the time they should be able to see the heartbeat on ultrasound at about the 6th wk.  At 8 wks you def get to see your little bean with the heart pumping away.      Sometime after 8 wks you might even be able to hear it with doppler, but they don't worry if they can't hear it then or even weeks after.    Your doc might be saying that their equipment won't get it, and that's possible.  Technology differing as much as it does.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I've heard around 8 weeks, but you may see little flutters and not a real heartbeat.  Enjoy your pregnancy.|`|gieEWY1Qaa	You should be able to at 6 weeks. And at 8 weeks it should be very visible.     Ask again. You might have to change doctors. Mine wouldn't do an ultrasound at all till 27 weeks. So I switched.     Good Luck|`|dn2UCOkqaa	I got an internal ultrasound done and I saw and heard my baby's heartbeat at 8 weeks and 5 days|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	I had 3 vaginal ultrasounds early in pregnancy.  At 5w 3d could only see a gestational sac but at 7ws 3d and 9w 3d the heartbeat was very visible.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Your doc doesn't know what she's talking about... If you don't see a heartbeat at 8 weeks something's wrong.. I saw my baby's at 6w3d. You most likely can't HEAR it until 10-13, so maybe that's what your doctor meant....    Congrats and Good luck!!|`|8am8ExsKaa	Yes you can see it beating at 6 weeks. I had my first ultrasound at 6 weeks and 3 days and I saw the little heart beating away. I don't understand why your Dr. would not let you if you are 8 weeks. I might ask again.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	My first ultrasound was done at around 6wks and I got to see the heartbeat|`|zXVIPLIyaa	at I measured 9 weeks and 5 days on my ultrasound.  It looks like a little baby you could see its arms and legs move and you could see and hear the heart beat.  My ultra sound at 6 weeks you couldn't really see anything but could see a small flicker that was the heart beat but could not yet hear it.|`|4cehW3S9aa	I had one at 9w and one at 11w 4d and both times on the ultrasound, you could see a strong heartbeat and what appeared to be a healthy little baby.|`|YuA7a08Maa	I saw a heartbeat at 6 weeks 4 days.  My cousin saw her twins' heartbeats at 6 weeks 2 days.  Before 6 weeks, you're unlikely to see it.  My doctor warned me that I might not be able to see it when I did.  I think they don't want to risk a pregnancy being at the wrong dates and then telling the mother she's having a miscarriage.  Congrats and good luck!
2SSD6BP9aa	If it's bothering you then I would mention something to THEM first.  It's possible they think they are being so discrete that nobody has seen what they are doing.      You don't want a reputation as a narc if people find out it was you who reported them.  And even some teachers don't like when students report on each other.  It's like grade school - no one likes a tattletale.    Just don't make it sound like you are saying "stop it or I'm telling!"    Good luck!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You don't have individual desks at your school?  If there is any truth to this, then call attention to it the next time you see them.  Raise your hand and say something to the teacher.  They won't be doing that again if the whole class finds out.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Yeah, i would talk to a counselor or a teacher if it is disrupting or troubling you, i know that touching in places like that is not allowed in schools. It is taking away from education and the purpose of school.|`|6mhFHSRSaa	I would agree with the previous poster. School isn't the right place for that behavior, and it is a distraction, if nothing else. It also shows that those kids don't have very good boundaries (by which I mean and understanding of what is appropriate where), and it would be better for everyone if they learned some better boundaries now. You may want to talk to your guidance counselor or a teacher you trust and ask for their help handling it. I probably wouldn't talk about it with other students, though. If the kids in this situation get "in trouble" and hear through the grapevine that you were behind telling on them, they may be unkind to you, and you don't deserve that. This is a legitimate concern and something the adults in the situation should be allowed to and able to handle. It may be as simple as just assigning different seats to everyone in the class, which a teacher can do without having to say anything about why. If you feel comfortable confronting them directly, you can do that as well.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	I say, wait until they are doing it again, and make a loud comment so everyone can hear. They can only blame themselves.|`|4CsGde1qaa	Yeah I been through the seat your on before. Snitch on them and tell them how you feel about it, otherwise enjoy the show and watch.|`|G02vO6Jwaa	i know what you mean. people have LITERALLY fingered each other in my school at lunch. kids are out of control and its gross. i'm not sure what can be done about this, but my school is lenient so, even if something was said, they wouldn't take it too seriously.  its gross. >|`|QR6IHIZxaa	lol thats sick man.   tell them that u can see what their doing, and chances are other people can to.   thats embarrassing and juss wrong for them to do that at skewl lol   still.. funny|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	You should pass them a note and tell them to quit or you'll have to tell an advisor because it's gross and distracting.|`|2VMs4hRKaa	Well you dot want to be know as a "tatle tail" i wouldn't talk to anyone yet unless it gets worse|`|AA11537580	talk to them after class  separate them in different seats
IuJjYz6gaa	9 months old?  Sheesh, you've been doing this too long.    It sounds like you'll have to let him learn to put himself to sleep.  There are many ways to do this, nearly all of them involve letting him cry until he goes to sleep on his own.  I know that's tough, but it is what is best for your baby.  He needs to learn good sleeping habits NOW.  If he doesn't, what's going to happen in a year?  Two years?    Tonight, start by beginning a night time routine.  Give him a bath, let him play, then lotion, then give him a bottle and read him a book or sing him a song, whatever you want to do.  Then say goodnight, turn off the lights and leave.  He will cry.      Now you can do this a couple of ways.  You can come back in, in 2 minutes and comfort him,calm him down, and leave and increase the amount of time to 4 minutes before you go in and calm him down, etc.  I elected not to do this because my leaving would always make my kids more angry and they would cry harder and ultimately made the process longer.  Some kids are different.    Or you can just let him cry until he goes to sleep.  The first night, it might take an hour, but each night it will take less and less time.  And he will learn that no matter how hard he cries at night, he has to go to sleep on his own.  As for the night wakings.  When he cries, go check on him, make sure he's okay, and then tell him he has to go back to sleep and leave.  He will probably cry again... but he will learn to put himself to sleep.    The night time routine is important because, to him, it signals sleepy time.  It gives him a chance to wind down and relax.    Good luck with all of this.|`|txbZujeRaa	My baby is almost 7 mos old and she wakes every 4 hours too.  I am ready to lose my mind some days.  Lately I don't go in unless her cry is desperate.  Sometimes if it's just a mid level cry, she will go back to sleep after about 15 min.... sometimes.  So I wait and assess what type of cry it is.  If it's desperate, I feed her.  Also, I just took her to a natural doctor in town, and he said she has a parasite.  And he said it is common in babies.  And that the parasite could be getting some of their food and also causing some discomfort.  I'm giving her this herbal stuff.  I can't really say that is what your baby has though.  I haven't finished the cleanse yet, but I am very hopeful that it will help.  I don't know if there is a doc like that in your area, but maybe try to find one.     And I hate it when people tell me she is spoiled.  That isn't it at all.  I let her cry on her own many times.  I don't automatically rush to her.  I could tell there was something else going on.|`|Njf3mot4aa	Judging by the pic, I am guessing he takes a binky.  Next time he wakes, try just giving him his binky and leaving.  He is probably just used to getting up for the bottle and it will take a little time to get out of the habit.  Try cutting him down to one bottle a night for a while and then when you are ready eliminate that.  The other thing you can try is just letting him cry.  I can't really suggest it because I was never able to do it as a mommy.  I don't think it is really cruel or anything, especially at this age.  I just couldnt bear listening to my son cry and it was easier to just go nurse or comfort for a minute knowing he would go back down quickly.  Good luck!|`|Y5hh8pb7aa	Gosh, what a nightmare.  I think he may be just a bit spoiled He doesnt want the  bottles to satiate him, rather for comfort. You'll just have to say no  EDIT: WHY THE F*CK DID YOU GIVE ME A THUMBS DOWN?|`|c2d66e358522de8a7fced132cb693320aa	Sounds like he might be using the night bottles as a pacifier type thing, your presence and the bottle as a way to get himself soothed back to sleep.     It will be challenging to break that pattern but there must be a way to do it; he needs to learn more self-soothing techniques instead (thumb-sucking is not a bad thing for a baby, for example...)     Unfortunately the only way he'll get desperate enough to try and calm down another way is if his favorite way (you rushing in with a bottle) isn't available. I'd get your pediatrician's advice on this one.|`|A1KwOUFCaa	Dont worry, I totally understand where you're coming from because I have been through the same thing. My son's 18 months now and I took him off of the bottle around 13 months. I had him on solids since he was 7 months old, but he never gave up his bottle at night no matter what I fed him in the day time. He used to be constipated all the time because he was drinking more than what he needed in a day, plus he would refuse food in the day time.     I took him to my doctor one day and he told me to start giving him water at night in the bottle. I was a little surprised at first, but once you try this you will be more surprised. My son gave up his bottle within 2 days, but he started taking his soother instead of the bottle. My doctor told me that he might cry for about a week or 2, but I had to stick to this and he will get sick of the taste and give it up soon....and he did.     So at night just fill a bottle with water and when he wakes up, just give him the water!!!!!    I dont know if your son takes a soother, but I also got him off of that habit :). All you have to do is just cut a little front off of the soother. He will still take it for a day or 2, but then he wont want it because it's of no use. If he still keeps it in his mouth some how, then after a few days, cut a little more from the front. Trust me this totally works!!!    He's now 18 months and he sleeps through the night without waking up :)    Good Luck!!!!
YuA7a08Maa	Plan B works by delaying your ovulation if you haven't ovulated yet.  It is similar to a high dose of birth control.  It can also prevent the sperm and egg from having a successful union.  If you've already ovulated and the egg has been fertilized, it prevents implantation of the baby into the uterus.  The embryo is a little ball of cells at this point and does not in any way resemble a human.  It does not cause an abortion of an implanted pregnancy and any blood may be because of the hormone changes.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Plan B will not have any effect on an existing pregnancy.  It is not the same as the abortion pill.  You bleed after taking it because of the hormones.|`|nPmnAXjUaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TBGt5K0s...    great vid on abortion!|`|dPyfP0ijaa	No, plan B will only PREVENT pregnancy implantation.     If you are already pregnant, Plan B will not work|`|eCKNRcIVaa	Absolutely not.  Plan B is in no way an abortion pill  The bleeding is just from he massive fluctuation in hormones, it is still simply your uterine lining and has nothing absolutely nothing to do with a "fertilized egg"|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If you were already pregnant, from what I've heard, Plan B doesn't do ANYTHING.    Plan B prevents the egg from attaching the uterine lining.  It's not abortion.    Also, that just sounds like a period to me. :/|`|iZDsMCghaa	No, it prevents conception. Thats why it should be taken withing 72 hours because it takes up to 3 days for the egg and sperm to meet, fertilize and attach to the uterine wall. If the pill is taken and the egg is already attached, there will be no harm to the baby whatsoever.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	no plan b doesn't terminate a pregnancy if fertilization has already occurred. It would only prevent a pregnancy that could have happened.|`|QyXJ4Ykzaa	No. Plan B is not an abortion. Sometimes you experience slight bleeding as a side effect of the plan B. All plan B does is protect the sperm from getting to the egg. That's why it has to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The sooner the better. If your egg is already fertilized then plan B won't work.|`|S7Y8L5lMaa	yes...it sheds the lining of the uterus so if anythings attached it will remove it.    a fetus could be their and if it is, some people think its like aborting a baby.    i think its okay since the baby hasnt started to develop yet.    good luck...i hope you arnt.    you can go the the local health department and they can give you information about it.    and no...thats what plan b does is makes you have a period. you wont ever know if you were pregnet or not.|`|7paHRmcSaa	No. Plan B has nothing to do with an egg. Taking plan B is to prevent pregnancy. It has no effect once you're pregnant

Someone decided to carry you for nine months.  Had they decided otherwise, you wouldn't be here today.  No matter the situation, it is not possible for it to be bad enough to exterminate a life.

Abortion is wrong, babies are babies from the time they imbed into the wall of the uterus. Use protection not abortion as a form of birth control. Abortion can cause many problems down the road when and if your gf wants a baby. Don't let PP tell you its safe cause its not, and some clinics will do the procedures on women who aren't even pregnant! Its about money not people.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	!ortions are wrong but look online they have certain websites that tell you search google|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Please stop posting abortion topics in the pregnancy section obviously the women in here want the babies try women's health.

(My turn soon) x|`|qYvDpa6daa	on an average cycle of about 28 days your edd would be 11th october.  its hard to say what symptoms you will get as every woman is different i can however tell you what symptoms i got:    nausea in the morning if i didn't eat anything. that went away by week 12  cravings.....i had a craving for hoover dust, ham sandwiches, and salt and vinegar crisps. that went by week 12-13   i didn't really feel many symptoms at all in the first 12 weeks, it was after 12 weeks that i started to feel different.   at 14 weeks i felt her move for the first time, it felt so strange and it felt like little gas bubbles but i DEFINITELY knew it was her. i didn't start showing a bump until i was about 15-18 weeks. at 20 weeks i found out i was having a baby girl. i then started feeling bloated and i got heart burn quite bad the last 3 months. i couldn't drink anything after 8pm from about 6-8 months as i would be up 5 times in the night going to the toilet. after 8 months i was fine up until about 3 weeks ago when i hit 39 weeks. the baby decided it would be funny to lay on my bladder at night every night. i think the thing i will miss the most is feeling her move inside me and also having a belly that shows im actually pregnant and not just fat lol. good luck to you and congrats

(that's what i tell my little patients when they need oxygen) and she will just drift off to sleep nicely.    They may also need to put a small tube in her vein depending on the anaesthetists choice and they will apply numbing cream first so it won't be painful at all- it's not even painful without it actually. They will usually do this before she is asleep.  When she wakes up she might be tearful as she will be feeling groggy and maybe sick but she will be absolutely fine, it's a very quick procedure and especially with children they like to get it done and wake them up without delay.  When you get home, as they are milk teeth, i doubt she will even have much pain as the roots are so small- i recently had a remaining milk tooth pulled out and it was a doddle, and i'm a massive wimp! If she does have pain, baby neurofen or calpol will sort it and the next day she will be fine.|`|ZgkMNG8qaa	stop feeding her guiness, she'll end up like Shane McGowan.

bc9inzicaa	My son was born at 10 lbs and 7 oz (i know big baby, but just gives me more to cuddle!).  Two weeks after he was born he weighted 11 lbs and 3 oz.  I asked the pediatrician if his size was concerning.  She stated there was nothing to worry about and he was perfectly healthy.      He is now also five weeks and probably weighs close to 13 lbs.  He is also a breastfeed baby.|`|MQ34YW28aa	depends on how much they weighed when they are born, every baby is different. my son was about 12 pounds at 5 weeks.

xam4Bmxpaa	I think donor sperm is a great option for couples who cant use their own.  You are able to fully screen all the donors now - looks, interests, intellegence etc....  Plus, genetics only make up a part of who we are - the way we are raised is more important.  I know serveral people who were adopted (which is even less genetically linked than donor sperm) and they adore their adopted parents.    Good luck - I think you should go for it.|`|aefb271af37a089fc25c8908176cce9caa	I think people should do whatever makes them happy. I think insemination is fine if you so choose. You can even pick people based on genotypes and health problems at some fertility places, so you can give your kids a good start.|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	I think it's fine. You can pick the donor you want and regardless of whose sperm, it's still your son or daughter. It doesn't have to confuse your child, they really don't have to know. If you love that child, then they're yours.
ARUVea4yaa	Girls genes are XX and boys genes are XY so you will always produce an X egg and you husband will produce X and Y sperm. however the whole boy thing is the same on my husbands side of the family too. all boys. All that means is the Y sperm(the ones that make little boys) are stronger swimmers|`|bVaZ72f3aa	no<br>  there is no way to confirm it.<br>  actually this is not proven scientifically,so that can only be a small incident somehow along the way.<br>  SO,basically speaking each man in the world can only have one gendered kids?<br>  im sorry but that is not true,<br>  my dad has: in order<br>  girl,19 years of age.<br>  boy,16 years of age<br>  15,girls(twins)..<br>  p.s the same mom|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	All men carry BOTH xx and xy sperm but sometimes they just keep getting only one. Many people I know are like that just keep getting the same gender babies. I don't know what it is. Perhaps when ejaculating only one side is used or used more than the other. Most men have one testicle bigger than the other so perhaps that is it. <br>  Tyffannie|`|8RfmosODaa	I dunno if there is a way to test that, good question. But I would think there would be a pretty equal amount of boy and girl sperm. My cousins (on my moms side) all had a boy first then a girl and for those who had 3 kids they had another boy. It's pretty weird, lol.

nLbifJkUaa	Hi, I'm going through the same exact thing!  I think I probably conceived on Feb. 11 and am now two weeks along (or 4 wks. preggo).  Had to go the the ER with some pretty severe nausea, vomitting and pelvic pain, and told them I could be pregnant.  Results came back positive for UTI, but not for pregnancy at that time, since I was not that far along.  What really confused me was the symptoms--I've had many many UTI's b4 but none with these symtoms.  I've been testing for pregnancy ever since, and each day the "test" line gets a little darker.  We've been trying for a baby for 3 yrs., and this would be our 1st.  Try to get Dollar General $1 preggo tests or Sav-a-Lot U Check $1 tests (buy like 10, since First Response is actually less sensitive early but about the same cost for a box of two, trust me, I got my first faint positive light pink line on a DG test!)...Test every morning with your first morning's urine or just make sure you don't drink a lot a few hours before the test.  Definately drink plenty of water after you test, though, and cranberry juice for that UTI!!  Best of luck to you sweetie, and remember, if you do turn out to be pregnant, make the best of it!  Children are a gift. Hope I've helped in some way, <br>  Best Regards!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I get moody with a UTI cause they hurt like hell!  I would take a test to be sure about the pregnancy thing...|`|IoG4eZETaa	Sweety your only safe protection is what you let it be. It sounds like you want to be prego. Any ways you can take a prego test (EPT) now its not to early. These symptoms could be but being very hungry this early is rare. Take a test if neg. take one in two days. Make it morning time.
6igjX2cnaa	hey hun.  I do have PCOS and have been undergoing fertility treatment to get pregnant.  I would always ask questions about everything during the ultrasounds and I asked a question about my uterus once while it was on screen.  The tech told me that they usually like to see 3 lines.  I'm assuming that these are endometrial stripes?? As I don't know what other lines she would be talking about.  Best wishes and good luck with everything hun :)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's not how many but how thick, you really only have one - it thickens with pregnancy, too thick without pregnancy is a problem too as is too thin as it needs to be ready to accept an embryo.   A thick stripe after menopause is associated with pathology, as too thick also when accepting an embryo.
Jswomud7aa	Because the genetic heritage of baby is so diverse you will probably end up with a beautiful baby, but it's unlikely that he/she will have blonde hair and blue eyes. Darker hair and darker eyes are much more dominant in genes, but who knows? Maybe.|`|4AO2myzKaa	It is possible, but if you were sleeping around with other men at the time, the only way to tell would be to have him take a paternity test.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	No, the baby should be purple with a red mohawk.

xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi Aubrey! It sounds like you little guy is just that - little. It is absolutely normal to see some fluctuation in the percentiles, and it is important to remember that this numbers are just a guide.    There are so many factors that can influence his development in this area - size of family (genetic factors), actual gestation at time of birth (he may have been earlier than thought), the use of breast milk versus formula, and the list goes on.    As long as he's eating, pooping, peeing and doing well in other areas, I would try to put this out of your mind. It sounds like your son is just right for him, and there isn't a medical worry. There is nothing special you can do to augment his percentiles - and please bear in mind that his skull is still developing, he's got a long way to go still (I believe it starts to slow down in development between 12 and 18 months)! The worst case scenario is that there be an eventual skull development abnormality, and these are rare and almost always solvable with minimum or no impact on the baby (i.e. craniosynostosis).    What an awesome mommy you must be - your son is very lucky to have you to love and care for him!    p.s. it is possible that they made a boo boo on the measurements at some point as well. It is really, um, challenging to measure a baby's head - especially with all that hair moving about, falling out and growing back in!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	By definition someone has to be in the 8th percentile for every one in the 92nd percentile.  Its only at less than 3rd (or in some places 5th) or above 97th (or in some places 95th) they get the least bit concerned, and even then more often than not it isn't a problem|`|yCwPxulYaa	If it makes you feel any better, my babies head is over the 95th percentile and her weight is only is the 50th.  So you are just at the other end of the spectrum.    You just have a little baby. It is normal to have some fluctuation in the growth curve.      If your doctor is not worried, I would not be.|`|iMMQSF7baa	If your doctor is not concerned you should not be concerned.|`|IRDTChvOaa	Wouldnt worry about it.  My mother has the skull the size of a child's.  She is fine...  And it looks normal on her as well.|`|c2d66e358522de8a7fced132cb693320aa	Those percentiles are just a measure of proportion. Your baby has an unusual proportion, but that doesn't mean you should worry about it -- your doctor isn't worried and she or he would know whether to worry!
dPyfP0ijaa	I did it all during my teenage years and never got pregnant . .  .BUT . . . my friend did the same, was even more careful, but she got pregnant at 16.      It only takes one.    Be careful. You should try another method of birth control, like the pill or something.|`|kprKXEOSaa	If you're going to have sex with a condom, AND have your boyfriend use the pull-out method, and then STILL worry about getting pregnant, why are you having sex again?  Doesn't this kind of take all the fun out of it?  To answer your question, as long as he put the condom on as soon as he had an erection, the chances are just about zero.|`|RarSAK4Haa	there is always a chance.|`|pVUhlg4iaa	sounds like ur pretty much on the safe side to me! it didnt break, sounds great!|`|mIn818Dcaa	The chance of you getting pregnant is 3-5%, so you're good. The condom makers can't guarantee that 100% because there's always that possibility...|`|PPqQ7yuDaa	What is so weird my boyfriend does the same thing.  We been together for a little over a year now.  And no pregnancy scare.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Condoms are 95% effective. "Pulling out" is hardly effective. You probably won't get pregnant.    Why did you ask a question you already know the answer to?|`|9QC1MD4Naa	If the condom didn't break and there wasn't any leaking, I'd say you're pretty protected. Condoms are 97% effective when used properly. If you're feeling nervous, ask your doctor about birth control pills, which are 99% effective when taken correctly. You can use both at the same time and double your protection!|`|kzKF4xrEaa	99% your safe. plus there is spermicides in the condom, which kills the sperm instantly.|`|AA10572259	If you are having sex then you should be on birth control.  Its not hard to get and then if you also use a condom you should be good to go.  If he put the condom on, you had sex and then he pulled out with the condom still on then there is little chance you are pregnant.  In the future I would use two methods of protection so you aren't spending all your time worried.  You don't even have to tell your boyfriend that you are on it, if you think he will pressure you into having sex without a condom.|`|9DFmppBeaa	Good job practicing safe sex. You have less than a 2% chance of getting pregnant. You're pretty safe!|`|QR6IHIZxaa	condom didnt break and he pulled out, no chance of pregnancy unless the condom doesnt properly fit on him.|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	about 5%|`|epAFmug9aa	you are screwed. expect a baby in 9 months or less. maybe you should stop having sex until you are at least 16.|`|ulMQkaoWaa	yeah youre definately fine, unless the condom did secretely break,.. :O    lol|`|QBpJxWCmaa	First of all, there is window of time that you can get pregnant in.  If you did all the things above truthfully there is a slim to none chance you would get pregnant .  If youre worried get on the pill.  But still be carefull it doesnt protect against stds!!
GGH0HVdvaa	these questions are fractured and dont make sense.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	you honestly should ask your mother|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	1. You get some self esteem because confidence attracts guys. And plus its only your low self esteem thats making you feel ugly. In the morning, look into the mirror and repeat something along the lines of "I am pretty" ten times. Do that every day and you'll soon start to believe it.    2. you move on and make some new friends. There is no point in worrying about the past. This person wasn't a true friend to you. They may have called you a Bestie but they betrayed you therefore they are not your friend. Go out and make new friends.    3. Speak to someone close to you about how you feel (parents, a brother/sister, a teacher, etc). You shouldn't keep your worries to yourself. Get them out in the open and it makes you feel better.    Also another piece of advice would be to get out your karaoke machine (if you have on) or put on a music channel and sing. Singing is a great de-stresser.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Say whuuuuuuu?|`|bkOn30I1aa	Sounds like your friend might be a little bit depressed. That can happen when one is a teenager, we take small things to heart and it really affects us a lot. What I used to do at that age was to think about all the positive things I had in my life, like my family and all of my friends ( I am guessing your friend doesnt only have 1 friend), also getting involved in after school activities is a great way to bust up your self-esteem  because you can make more friends there and also enjoy whatever activity you are into. I used to dance and also play volleyball, as every teenager when I started in my dance class I was very shy and didnt want to go but I stuck to it and I ended up loving it and making lots of friends there. So you see, there is a lot of things your friend can do to get out of that mind set she is in, and be happy. That is such a beautiful stage of life; you guys should enjoy it, not waste it being depressed. Try to help your friend, dont leave her (him) alone, that will show her how good of a friend you are.|`|2qsbDj7Aaa	you are not ugly, no woman is really ugly, you just need to learn to fix yourself up properly. real friends dont let you down, she wasnt a real friend, you will know what real friends are like as you get older, crying is a good way to vent, just dont overdo it      there ya go|`|pPc2kZfwaa	well wear somemakeup or something i dont really know this answer|`|wfE3mo7Naa	1) Get an ugly boyfriend    2) Call the police    3) Dont go places.|`|Jl1ZwAmaaa	1. your probably not ugly. Everyone has their akward stage and 13 sounds about right, also, people your age are typically sooo self concsious and dramatic, so it's probably not as bad as u think. Wait and be patient. You are never going to get a BF being as negative as you are.The boys will grow up and if your personality is AWESOME , regardless of what you look like, you'll find some. Youre only 13, hang in there....    2. Again, you're 13. As u grow up, u'll realize friends come and go. Im 21 and have 1 friend left fomr High school. Staying friends with the ppl you are BFFs with now, it sooo not likely. Does it suck> yes, But, its reality. You will get through it and thats it. Plus, if i remember correctly, 13 yr old girls change friends and boyfriends like they change their underwear.... tomorrow, those 2 probably wont be friends anymore. My advice is to kick that girl to the curb if she tries to come back to being friends with u..... she isnt a very good friend.    3. Umm, I think thats normal adolescent emotion. CRY and let it all out.... u'll feel better! However, if u ever at any point feel like u dont want to live or this crying persists for MONTHS, u may want to consult in a family member or someone u can trust, u may need help.    Overall, hang in there, hunny. Adolescents sucks! But, make the best of it! Put a smile on and remember, its not what your dealing with that matters, its how you handle it.  Smile!! and Good Luck!
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Have you tried eat, play, eat, sleep, eat, play, eat, sleep?  Just to start?    Its weird that he doesn't nurse to sleep, have you been trying to force the E.A.S.Y method (eat, active, sleep, you time) method?|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I would be careful about doing that.  His eat play sleep routine is better for him to learn good sleeping habits.  As he gets older, it will be harder to get him to sleep without nursing (or a bottle if you switch).  And it will become a very difficult habit to break.  It is easiest if you teach them good sleeping habits from the beginning and never nurse him to sleep.    Maybe start a naptime and nighttime routine, so he will fall asleep easier but still not nursing him to sleep.|`|c2d66e358522de8a7fced132cb693320aa	It may actually be that your baby just wants a longer cycle of wakefulness now than you'd been using before; if he won't go to sleep then he's not sleepy, eh?     I can see why you might want to use the food as a way to make him sleepy, but that may just make him more likely to fall asleep while eating and thus not get a full tummy, thus not sleeping as long as he otherwise could... or eating more and more slowly as he gets more and more snoozy... etc.    I'd recommend the book "Secrets Of The Baby Whisperer" by Tracy Hogg for more advice on these patterns and how to swap routines if you must. Good luck!
vue9NOhYaa	They don't.  The idea that babies have to bundled up in 20 layers of clothing is very dated -- and very dangerous.  (Overheating is associtaed with SIDS.)    Dress your baby roughly as you dress yourself, with maybe one additional layer. (i.e., a onesie under his sleeper or shirt and pants).  The only thing baby might need that you don't is a hat -- he hasn't much hair to keep his head warm and you want to be sure that he doesn't get sunburnt.|`|7gde2DRraa	The general rule is that they wear 1 layer more then you are wearing.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That's not true.  My baby was born in a heat wave.  There's no way he needed warm clothing!  When I took him out it was in a swaddle, with a diaper and a shirt or onesie.  Occasionally people on the street would tell me, as people on the street occasionally find it necessary to for some reason, that he needed a hat.  Ridiculous.  It was 95 degrees out!  They do need to be kept out of the sun, though obviously.|`|AA11100518	don't do it.  you should dress your baby the same way you dress to be comfortable in the environment.  dressing them too warmly is an old wives tale and it doesn't help (as you have noticed).  don't you want your baby to be comfortable?  they are 98.6 just like you, dress them like you dress.  if you wear shorts, they should.  if you are wearing a coat, then they probably need one.  if you're in a tee shirt and jeans,that is ok for them.|`|wvGv8WQ6aa	You just need to keep your baby warm because of the life he is use to living in the whom and that's where he was comfortable so we try to keep their new environment as close to the same as it was in the whom. Excessive clothing isn't necessarily needed though. A warm sleeper with socks on and a blanket wrapped in a swaddle will be plenty. Don't worry, he will be warm, and if he's not he'll let you know!|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I had my daughter on September 2nd... in MIAMI... it was beyond HOT. I did not layer her with a million onesies and blankets. Newborns only need a layer more than you do. Chloe came home is a nice cotton long-sleeved dress with a thin blanket over her car seat. She was fine. You need to keep them cool and comfortable.|`|1dueLOdvaa	Dress the baby how you dress. Just bring a blanket or something like that for added warmth in case you need it.    You don't want to over heat your baby.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	The rule of thumb is in cold weather, babies should have one layer more than you do, while in the summer, they can wear the same as you're wearing.  I think the older generation really believes that babies need to be kept super warm, but really, they need to be comfortable.  I promise you, your baby will let you know if they're uncomfortable.      I gave birth in July of last year and my AC didn't work too great.  We had a fan in the room and my great aunt almost had a heart attack when I had the baby (1 day old!) next to the fan.|`|rOFteEdlaa	you don't need to put winter clothing on him or anything just make sure he is warm enough, my youngest was born in aug and i would put her in a onezie and have a blanket over her as long as it was really warm out other then that she was in shorts and t-shirts and she has only been sick 2 times in her life and they were both in winter time (currently has an ear infection)|`|QvoPb2SBaa	don't overbundle! I had my son in summer and on the 4th day, we had a onesie on him and we bundled him up to sleep. He wouldn't sleep at all and kept crying. Finally we realized he was too hot and brought him downstairs and unbundled him. He was a happy baby after that. Your baby will let you know if he's too hot. Check the back of baby's neck if he's fussing to see if its sweaty. I also let him run around with just a diaper when it was really hot (we have no air conditioning throughout the house).

VClxXNs3aa	wellll... when I was in school expulsion meant you could not attend that school or any other school in the district for 1 full year. after 1 full year you could return.  but, in the meantime, your parents could do homeschooling, so you wouldnt lose a grade level.....  not sure if it the same now or in your area.... but I think homeschool or an alternative (bad kids) school would be your only options.|`|hOEIFpl5aa	ok well you need to explain to your dean what really happened. then if you still are expelled then you need to go your new school and explain to them. i hope everything works out good.|`|hYohgOcAaa	first   teachers a *****  well the only thing u can do now is try to clean up your words, b/c words got u in trouble u need to revise them  be nicer if that helps   it will probably appear on ur transcript so u got to watch out and do a lot of explaining in ur new school   cuz they will probably make ppl watch you at ur new school SO BE VERY CARE-FULL keep an open eye and mind

DPegPYRPaa	My husband was recently out of work for almost 8 months. During that time him and my daughter seemed to get on their own little schedule. There were times I disagreed but overall he was the one with her all the time and so I would trust his judgement. When I got home we would do our thing and then she would go to bed. But I can understand that they feel into a routine of things and maybe he like that routine since he's finally got it down and doesn't want to confuse the child with doing something different each day. Talk to him about it. Sit down and express you feelings and maybe you twon can work out a simple routine that is close to what he already is doing. Maybe he feels like you don't trust him to make the right choices when he has her. If worst comes to worst, try a family counselor.|`|jLYTKr33aa	First of all, you should NEVER limit a baby's food intake.  She should be able to eat on demand, and her nutritional needs will change drastically as she grows.  I would immediately schedule an appointment with your daughter's pediatrician to have him or her speak to your husband about proper nutrition for your baby.  That said, it's common for parents to have little disagreements.  If you have too much trouble compromising, it may be time for the two of you to see a counselor.  Good luck.|`|SSFy8eHNaa	You are lucky that I do not know you.  I would have reported you to protective services, this is NEGLECT!  A 5 month old baby should be drinking 26-40 ounces of milk a day.  So what you are feeding her is WAY under the min. even!  I cannot believe some people think they can be parents...I almost think that now days we need to give license to people to even become parents...this is terrible!     If you need help with formula, you need to go find help. Don't just sit around the house.  Go to your local food shelf or government agency/human services....ugghh.    I cannot believe this..  This has many health hazards, not feeding her enough can stunt her growth and for sure it stunts her brain growth...  So when your child had difficulty in school later on in life, you can blame yourself.  Also, when someone reports you, and takes her away it will be all on you as well.

Ar80Ri8eaa	Abstinence only sex ed is like sending soldiers to war with marshmallows and a good luck.     We need SERIOUS COMPREHENSIVE SEX ED in ALL HIGH SCHOOLS.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	NO **** they need to talk more than just abstinence only!!  I'm sorry, but kids are going to be having sex no matter how much you tell them not to! Kids need to know about contraceptives, STDS ,what to do if you are pregnant, planned parenting centers, and also sex should not be portrayed as a bad thing.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Abstinence isn't going to work for everyone just look at the questions in here.  They need to start at the 12 year old level and discuss protection against pregnancy and disease.|`|2qsbDj7Aaa	i think they should preach safe sex instead of abstinence, bunch of old hypocrites|`|YrzvVWb4aa	Abstinence based sex education is not enough.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Sex ed scared the crap out of me knowing about all the awfull things I could catch I waited till I was 23 to give it up. I also wanted to wait for someone I really cared for.    I don't know what class you are in but they taught us all about safe sex right down to finger condoms . And that was 12 years ago.|`|Rbb3rqPQaa	i'm guessing your American and from what i've heard on here your sex ed is appulling in Britain we do learn how to have safe sex but i still think our sex ed isn't good becuase it is not taught frequently enough and teachers are embarrassed.|`|cqW3NhqVaa	I believe they should be taught everything they need  to know about sex, I actually almost decided to become  a high school sex ed teacher, but sadly, my university, does  not offer sex ed teaching, and I didnt want to transfer.|`|JLrs8bxdaa	I think they should have sex ed, but talk about the real stuff.  Teens are going to have sex one way or another, if sex ed doesn't give condoms and talk about safe sex and stuff there are going to be more and more pregnant teens.|`|9QC1MD4Naa	My high school didn't go into abstinence OR sex education really. We just learned the anatomy and that's about it. Not how it worked or how to use it or how to protect yourself. I'm originally from the North too, but now that I live in the South, it seems like a lot of schools refuse to teach sex education. Teenagers need to know how their bodies work.|`|BODOF33caa	I think education IS important- however all sides of the issue should be shown. Abstinence should be viewed as the best and only 100% sure protection option. Then there should be education on the effects of having sex at a young age, possibilities of std's, emotional trauma, pregnancy, bad reputations, parental mistrust, and the knowledge that very few teenage relationships are committed enough to handle these effects that many girls (more so than guys) face. Then there should also be education on other methods of protection, the anatomy, pregnancy etc... This should be taught in a health class where other aspects of a healthy lifestyle are taught such as nutrition, fitness, wellness, mental health etc...  I don't think we should write off teens that they will all go out and have sex, most aren't.   -Best of Luck|`|fkiKjmObaa	i think so.just telling kids not to have sex doesn't seem to be doing that much.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	my school teaches abstinence in sex-ed too. its pointless because most of the kids have already had sex. schools need to get whats going on and just teach protection, cause kids are having sex anyways.|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think they should talk about abstinence AND how to prevent pregnancy.    At my middle school, I was taught proper sex education.  How to use condoms, when you ovulate, how birth control works, std's, yaddaa yada.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	They should educate kids on everything about sex, not just certain parts.      I'm not talking about positions or stuff like that, but all the options and possibilities of and about sex.

stUzx5VVaa	Just keep nursing.  She's still very young and trying to establish your milk supply, so she's going to want to nurse a lot, and you just have to kind of roll with it.  She'll do that on occasion, and the best thing to do is just nurse her as much as she wants.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	lots of fluids, lots of time with the baby on the breasts, pumping when baby isn't , some ppl recommend herbal supplements...if it gets really bad, call the doc, i think they can prescribe something to help....gl|`|avx7bLnKaa	do you just pump or breastfeed as well? if you are doing both and baby is at breast alot then you have enough,....  i am nursing my second child and i felt my supply wasn't what it was with my first so i am drining mother's milk tea twice a day [amazon.com].... i feel it has worked... hoever best solution is to breastfed baby more and give bottles less... you can puimp the milk after each feeding at the breast....     baby gets out more milk than pump does|`|AlbJmy7aaa	Exercise can help!  I use a treadmill.    Express yourself!|`|baI5G8yLaa	ok the above comment not so sure about! you gave birth 9 days ago and generally exercise decrease milk supply so hold that one off lol!    Things is your baby is only 9 days old! your milk supply isn't fully adjusted as its still all new! The second is baby's at her age tend to constantly feed my boy at that age was stuck to my boob i seriously couldn't have a shower without him crying and wanting more and they also tend to use you as a dummy/pacifier!   you need to give it a good 6 weeks before things tend to calm down the key if she is gaining weight then you have enough milk supply!    If not there are things you can do   don't diet eat an extra 500 calories a day   drink plenty of water  plenty of rest when possible   try not to stress too much  and if all fails you can take fenugreek    hope i have helped    x|`|FiszETBoaa	It is still really early...it took me a good week or so to get going. Pump after you feed. The stimulation will increase your supply. When you feel you are done pumping, go a few more min.   Also, look at a pic of your baby, or have your baby in eye sight when you pump...some people say its psychological :)    Good Luck & don't give up it is the best bonding experience.
PTdy6TWRaa	Some of my kids as well as many that I work with now or have in the past have been labeled with ADHD. I am very resistant to the idea of using medications to manage them so I've always tried other methods to bring about calmer and more focused behavior.  One simple strategy that works for me is to provide lots of extremely active play in each day. When they can burn off surplus energy they find it much easier to settle and focus. For my boys the activity needs to be fairly intense and sometimes they need to get at something like that a few times in one day for it to tame their relentless energy and impulsiveness.<br>  <br>  Having a routine that is very predictable and being obsessed with consistency and follow-through helps greatly too. Good luck!|`|SfwLF8j2aa	vagabond...you are an idiot!!! I have 3 children with a.d.h.d.,one also has o.d.d.

We are so sorry we waited!  Their ability to focus and behave has improved immensely.  We are even able to travel - something we could never do with them before.|`|2vz59utAaa	If when you get home and your child isn't in the fetal position in the corner then you have failed as a parent.

It worked the first month. I also bought a clearblue easy fertility monitor that month. Try buying one of those too and using the clomid. Worked for us.. Good luck and god bless you. I know this time is really hard for you.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	I had ttc for 13 months before going on clomid.  I got pregnant on my third round!  There is only a 10% increased risk of having twins when taking clomid.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend using preseed with clomid.  It is a lube that creates a friendly environment for his boys to swim in.  You can buy it at www.preseed.com.  I used it my third month on clomid when I got pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!|`|fYMWDQLGaa	more than 95% of the couples get conceived with in 3 cycles of using CLOMID. also many of my friends have conceived using the same. so goodluck and baby dust to you. ;)
krQiDGCHaa	Children can get fever and diaper rash from teething.  At 12 months, she absolutely may have some teeth coming in, which may be causing the diaper rash.    You say there are some light red bumps on her tummy as well?  When did these develop?  Sometimes, children can get a rash from their fever -- just called fever rash, and nothing to worry about.    Keep the appointment with your doctor to have her checked out in case, but it very may well be teething.    Also, ear infections can cause fever as well, and the diaper rash may be unrelated.    Good luck.|`|K4tAeTNRaa	Sounds like Hand Foot and Mouth disease.  Check her hands, wrists, feet and ankles for any red marks (they may be blister like or just look like small red marks like bug bites depending on the severity).  When my son had it the worst symptoms were on his butt like you described and in his mouth, he only had a few marks on his hands and feet that I didn't even notice until the doctor pointed them out.  There is no cure as it is a viral infection so the best thing to do is make sure she stays hydrated (my son preferred juice boxes as the small straw meant nothing hard touched the sores in his mouth and on his tongue) and give her lots of hugs and kisses.  It only lasts about a week, but you are probably a couple of days in already so she should start feeling better soon.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Probably cutting teeth.

Next!  -Isabella-Too popular.  ++Laurel-Sounds so pretty. Like a meadow. ? Haha.  --Logan-Is a boy's name. I'm sure it's unisex.

They need to do a laparoscopy to see where they are going- it's the same wounds and recovery as just laparoscopy.  All they do is inject dye through the cervix and use the cameras to watch the dye go down the tube.

I'm not keen on for Christopher for a girl but I do like the nickname of Kit. I think that would suit a girl. Isn't there are an actor/actress named Topher?|`|MdSU0s8Saa	chrissy is cute but i wouldn't use christopher as a girls name  maybe use something similar like christine or christiana or christina|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	I am afraid that she may be made fun of if you name her Christopher.  You know how cruel kids can be!  Try Kristen, Kristie, or just Crissy instead.  Or my personal favorite Christa, which gets most of the sounds from Christopher in it!!!|`|TYl7kmPeaa	yes christine/christina would be a good choice.. or something else that sounds similar to it  because i hate boy names for girls  boys names are for BOYS and girls names are for GIRLS|`|PQjPq6Ddaa	Christyna   Christol  Christophine--- This sounds very old fashion, and i bet no one else has this name...  and you can call her chrissy... but if you use this name use Katherine not Katy.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Personally I dont like using Christopher as a girls name.  What about doing Christina or something that is close?|`|jjWDRuDHaa	You could do.. Christine, or Carissa or Christiana too.|`|5BOhn6Ubaa	DO NOT NAME HER THAT.    Christine,Christina,Krista....    there r a lot.    u pick.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	No I don't. That's harsh, and I think it's harsh for anyone to give a girl a boy's name. Boy's should have boy names, and the same with girls.    Christianna, Christina, or even Chrissy, Crissy. Don't give her a boys name.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	Christa?|`|oYazZKhbaa	umm... christina for a girl...not christopher|`|s1KdupLnaa	i love using boys names for girls i think its so cute! so i would go with it :)|`|k8IvSoidaa	kristine|`|Eznh0ebYaa	please don't name your daughter christopher, she will get a lot of grief for her name. how about christie, christa, christina, christine, or just chrissy|`|Ew2wC9piaa	well i do not really care for a girl to have a boys name because i have a boys name and i am always being called mister or sir my name is Morgan yes it is a unisex name but it is spelled like this for a girl Morgann and my mom thought it was silly to have the extra "n" on the end so its Morgan (boys way of spelling it)  try Christina my hubby's name is Christopher as well but is not into naming any children after either of us. there are many "Jr's" in both of our families we want to be unique that's why our son is named Damian|`|heC9aQ18aa	What other people shouldn't matter. Your baby, your business. Now, to answer your question I hate this trend of naming females with male names. It's getting ridiculous. Baby girls named Joseph and Oliver. It's ridiculous. I mean are there no female names anymore. Daddy is named Christopher so why not call her Christina or some variation of the name. Not the same as Christopher but that's because that is a male name and should stay male. If you have to use it I would put it as a middle name where it's perfectly acceptable. Katy as a middle name is not really a good one either especially if the child is stuck with the first name Christopher. Whatever you do make sure the middle names are ultra feminine so at least people will have a clue a woman is showing up and do not expect a male. I can also assure you she would be teased about her name, no matter how nice it is that she was named after her father. Children don't care and she would be teased for sure. Sorry if I sound harsh, it's just that this thing of naming girls with boys names is getting to be outrageous and there should be a law against it or at least some type of regulations. Soon parents who want to name their sons, a name only used by males will be out of luck and will be stuck naming their rosey cheek sons Herman and Earl. Not a pretty picture.
1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	yeah that's fine, i use 2 eat it all the time, i think its homemade and unpasteurized mayo u have 2 stay away from|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Go ahead and eat. It won't hurt you. Personally I wish I could eat eggs, but the smell and sight of them make me sick.    Enjoy|`|HP1pToMOaa	You are absolutely safe with both mayo and cooked eggs.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	I ate potato salad (complete with lots of mayo and boiled eggs) all the time during pregnancy.  Eggs and mayo are fine.|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's fine, as long as it's pasterusized and thoroughly cooked.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	if ur eating mayonnaise from jars then it should be fine as u say its pasteurized however its homemade mayonnaise that could be a prob as it uses raw eggs and the advice is for pregnant women to avoid raw eggs.|`|ksqIYFQUaa	Raw egg is a no no so no mayo|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes, it's fine.    The problem is when you eat or drink UNpasteurized foods.|`|bTlhBX3daa	As long as you are eating pasteurized Mayo, and cooking your eggs all the way through, you are fine. Mayo is only a concern because of uncooked egg, and egg is only a concern because of possible bacteria if not cooked fully through (i.e. sunny side up, over easy, etc).     Also, your body tends to crave what it needs for both you and the baby. If you are having strong cravings, you most likely are lacking something in the eggs and/or mayo. There is even a condition associated with this called Pica. It can cause mothers lacking in certain nutrients to eat things like dirt, corn starch, etc.     I always eat what I'm craving, even when I wasn't pregnant.|`|eM1kHW1saa	don't eat home made mayo and eggs are ok as long as they are cooked properly and they cant be runny|`|AA12008520	these foods are safe....and on the subject, when I found out I was pregnant with my first child (girl) A older co-worker told me I should eat a lot of eggs...that its "brain food" for the baby. So I did, and I don't know if its by chance or it worked or what, but my daughter is 6yrs old and is in the accelerated learning program in school, and an honor roll student who wins numerous awards, and gets "100" on the bench mark exams administered. Everyone who knows her sais she extremely smart....So I say go 4 the eggs....it cant hurt.    Congrats on the baby! Blessings.
vZ5EbvtJaa	No sweetie you're not. sperm has to go from him to inside you....no sperm from fingers :) Stop stressing! Most likely this is why your period is late.|`|hWc65sEtaa	I seriously doubt it.  Wait another week, then test.  Stress can cause your period to be late.|`|AA11763588	If there were NO SPERM involved, then NO. You are just late.    Stress can delay a period, so calm down.|`|8V39PymEaa	no not unless he had sperm on his fingers your fine and you can't get pregnant from fingering only penetration|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You could be.  Buy a pregnancy test and take it.  If you are pregnant it will show up.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	you got a F on your sex edd right. if theirs no sperm involved your ok but if their was you need to take a test and check if your pregnant.|`|wPtX51cjaa	no|`|BGpm57ROaa	do we need to explain the birds and the bees to you?|`|O5AF5IrQaa	Dont worry. if all he did was finger you than you have nothing to worry about. and besides, the white discharge is your body's natural cleanser for your vagina. your vagina is a self cleaning organ and if you didnt have this discharge, you could get infected with many types of bacteria. This is completely normal. Nothing to worry about (:|`|fBBJlXBCaa	are you like in jr high? or younger? because obviously you are so uninformed about sex and pregnancy. PLEASEEEEE do yourself a favor and become educated. normally i would say, if all he did was finger you then you couldnt get pregnant. BUT considering the fact that you think you can be, must mean you dont understand how sex and pregnancy works. so when you say "i didnt have sex" im not sure how far you two actually went. do yourself a favor and take a test so you dont have to stress. chances are you'll get one line. negative. there are lost of other factors that delay a period, two of which are: stress or the fact that you are still young and your cycle is won't be completely the same month to month.

GGH0HVdvaa	start thumbing through hair style magazines until you find a style that looks good (also helps if the model has the same hair color as you so you really get the idea of how it'd look), then go to the hair salon and ask them to do that style. Bring the magazine. I dont know what would look good on you, you just got to pick something you like and go with it! hope all works out. =)|`|PExOJJLgaa	maybe you should get a straight perm, and a side fringe.  (bang)    it would definitely fit your face more and give you a cute, edgy style.      DON'T CHANGE YOUR COLORR.  it's gorgeous!    P.S. Don't forget the layers--but don't go overboard!|`|n3h9Byhpaa	You "H8 PREPPY"?  You look pretty preppy to me XD    I would get some like reddish tints to your hair and maybe some highlight/lowlights.|`|pYHfZODGaa	you're a very pretty girl.  but i don't think you should add any new color to your hair. maybe try a new style. a new cut.  look through hair magazines and look up hair styles on google.|`|qJOOq93zaa	Hii :)      You should dye your hair light brown and with blonde highlights. That would look sooo good on yuuu . Also, you should get a straight perm or straighten your hair. Your hair is a bit too wavy and it would look awesome if it was straightened. You should also get bangs. Front bangs would look great, but side bangs would also suit you.  && as for your beauty, I especially luvvv your eyes. They are really good, especially with the eyeliner. You should put a bit more makeup on though. So, I think you are pretty, but you'd look better if you did something with your hair and face.

DPegPYRPaa	I don't think speech therapy would be a bad idea. They can really help work with you to fix a problem and they would be the best to know if you will always have a problem or not. I hope it works out.|`|zmM4u4qmaa	Does your school maybe have a speech therapist that you could see without having to pay additional money?  I had trouble with R's when I was young (younger than you) and I saw a speech therapist in public school. I'm fairly certain that there was no cost to my parents.
mGubEYTRaa	Afternoon naps are the best.  If you go too long between the morning nap and putting him down to bed he could get overtired.      All the parenting books I've read confirmed that you should give up the morning nap first.  My daughter has been on one nap since she turned one, and has taken one diligently every day and she is turning two soon.  She usually naps from 12-3pm, but other parents that I know do 11am for the afternoon nap.  Probably slowly push the morning nap back later and later like twenty minutes later one day, then another twenty minutes the next, until you are at the hour you want him to go down.    good luck!|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	My granddaughter is 2 1/2 and she takes a 2 1/2 nap from 12ish to 3. We eat lunch around 11:30 and then read and take a nap. I would try an earlier afternoon nap, so he is happy during dinner and after.|`|780ByZVEaa	we dropped them both and put him in the middle. We put our son down anywhere between 11am and 1 pm and he will sleep for about 2 to 4 hours. If it is in the middle of the day like that he is more pleasant|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hey my first son was the same and i just dropped the morning one and he slept for 2 hours in the afternoon from 1-3 pm then bed at 8pm he was fine with it and it ment he was ready for the afternoon nap and then ready for bedtime. my second son is just bout to turn 1 year old and he only has one nap in the afternoon for 2 hours. good luck.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	My daughter is 1 1/2, and she's down to one nap a day, usually just after lunch, unless she had a rough night, then she takes one before (usually because she climbed into bed and went to sleep herself).     She's also already in a bed, so she can come and go as she pleases, but nap time never seems to be an issue.     Why not improvise, and move nap time to in between his current naps? I would probably skip the morning nap, and see how long he goes before he starts dozing off, and then make nap time that time.     Good luck!
ickyq53aaa	Birth control pills are prescription medication.  They must be prescribed by a doctor.|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	Not at the moment there will soon be a law to let pharmacists dispense them however walk in clinics will always give you a month's worth for free, however I think these would be the most basic ones, like Microgynon, the ones that controls acne are usually prescribed (mainly because it's more expensive and is not to be used on a permanent basis).  Why not ask your doc for a repeat prescription?  That way you can just pick it up at reception without seeing them every single time and then it's really quick|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You can not get birth control without a prescription.  You can go to a planned parenthood and get them for free, but you will need an exam first.  There is a good reason that you can't get them without a prescription!  They aren't safe to take with certain medical conditions, and you need a little bit of education on how to take them.  Also the doctor needs to be able to monitor you for side effects.    If you just want them for acne then try something else!  There are plenty of OTC creams that you can try.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No. You have to have a prescription for birth control. Any other way to get prescription birth control is illegal.|`|AA10622097	No, you can't. You need to be seen by a doctor to have pap tests done, have your blood pressure checked, and monitored for all the other side effects.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	You can't.  You have to have a prescription from a doctor.  Planned Parenthood often will cut down prices for birth control, based on income.  Try there.|`|BHacM0GTaa	I lost my insurance (stopped carrying it at work), and have had to use online pharmacies to reorder my birth control.  It took a lot of research, but I found a couple reputable and LEGAL pharmacies.  I order Yasmin from HowToGetBirthControl.net (ill put a link below).  You have to fill out an online form and they send that to a doctor who issues you an online prescription for their pharmacy.  I think it took a day to get it approved and then it was shipped overnight, so I had it in less than 2 days. It was all pretty easy and it was the same packaging and same pills that I was taking before.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Nowhere. You need to see a doctor. The only things you can buy over the counter are condoms and spermicides.|`|4c0lcJReaa	PLANNED PARENTHOOD GIVES BC WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION. THEY USUALLY GIVE IT THE SAME DAY. AND IN MY AREA ITS $75. IT MAY BE CHEAPER OR LESS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE. YOU CAN ALSO GET IT FOR FREE IF YOU DONT HAVE A JOB OR MAKE MINIMUM WAGE. JUST BRING CURRENT PAYSTUBS.|`|9QC1MD4Naa	I always cringe when people try to use online pharmacies. It's not safe, because there's no way for you to know what they're actually giving you!    You can get generic brand birth controls, which are cheaper than name brand, but you'll still need a prescription.|`|QyXJ4Ykzaa	No. It's illegal. You have to go to the doctor.     Although...not to sound cruel...in previous questions you talk about being a lesbian... you don't really need birth control if it's only to be used as a contraceptive.    EDIT:       For acne if you're not wanting to go through with the whole gyno exam you can try to go to a dermatologist. They can give you samples of stuff that'll work to clear up your acne. I used to have it really bad and even BC pills didn't work. My dermatologist just gave me a whole bunch of samples of defrin (i think that's the name of it) and it worked.      And EDIT again:     I don't see why I got a thumbs down. I'm not trying to be rude. It's just if she didn't want the BC for contraceptives then there are other ways to get the other benefits of BC pills.|`|YuA7a08Maa	When I was on birth control, I went to my local health department to get pills.  You do have to see the nurse there and change your gynecology care to them, however.  But they do it based on a payscale.  I only had to pay $6.00 per month for them and I made $20,000 a year at the time.  You could try that.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	dont believe you can|`|Dfppbeo8aa	yea, right, for acne....but anyway, you can usually go to your local health dept and get them for free, after an exam, of course.|`|fUBOrpyraa	Planned Parenthood or Mexico....|`|all0ZxTlaa	No but you can purchase spermicide inserts at CVS or Walgreens. They work great. They're called Encare.

9bdf921965d7d8443214ab51a1a45541aa	my baby is only eight months and she has just given up eating baby food cold turkey. she refused to eat baby food for three days and I started to freak out as well. I noticed she was more interested in what I was eating so I thought i would introduce her to table food early. I would just make sure the texture was ok for her to swallow and that it didnt have a lot of seasonings. She is eating it perfectly and happier than ever. I know most adults wait until the child is one or over to give them table food, but my child is wearing a 2T and has seven teeth..she was absolutly over baby food. I would experiment a little and ignore what all the books say. Afterall, every baby is different. Just monitor the baby for reactions and regular stools.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	My 10 month old  refuses lumps sometimes i think because he is teething and also he has got a fever and cold lately. I too went back onto stage one food. he loves fruit, so I sometimes disguide food with a dip into fruit puree. That helps. I would say if it continues you need to take her to the doc, but try giving her what she wants for now. My son is on stage one cereals again because he is sick poor thing. But I know he will eat better when he is well.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Take her to the doctor.<br>  <br>  My second child never even tasted baby food.  I skipped that step all together and gave him table foods starting at 6 months.|`|bzgo59anaa	I know at 10 months this may be a little young to do this but.... I always took my children with my grocerie shopping and had them pick some of the things out that they liked.... if she is to young for this my suggustion would be to at this point stick to the things you know that she likes. Many people will say "she'll eat when she's hungry" which is true but i never liked waiting untill she was starving to feed her! some of my favorites that my boys enjoyed was frozed fruit, lunch meat, peas from the can (yes un-cooked) and although there quite expensive they also loved the gerber lunch things like the ravioli, noodles ect...... just keep trying, you'll get there at some point|`|BUXC2Kz0aa	My son did the same when he cut his teeth...hv said as long as he's having milk then not to worry!!! But if she's refusing milk then it could possibly be something else...because milk won't irritate her gums although she may not like the sensation of the teat on them! HTH|`|5I4imquJaa	has she had injections recently?<br>  <br>  my 1 year old went backwards with regards to eating, about a week after having the mmr injection....|`|JWYs2pBgaa	is she cutting teeth? she might have sore gums and the harder consistency of the foods might be irritating for her?|`|eIBPisAAaa	go to your doctor maybe she is developing a reflux condition, which can be fixed btw :)<br>  <br>  Good luck
oVxr5B3Eaa	Yes, you take it the morning after you have unprotected sex, and again 12 hours later. It's not like an abortion because by that time the baby hasn't even began to start forming.. it just puts a stop to you ovulating. If you are already pregnant, it doesn't do anything. <br>  No, you cannot use the morning after pill every time. First of all, your only supposed to use it like 4 times MAX in your life. It's EXTREMELY hard on your body. It makes a lot of people feel sick (others feel nothing) and it throws off your periods for up to 2 years. You might get extra period, no periods, really heavy period, etc. It makes you really tired and it makes you feel so gross a lot of people throw up after they take it. Plus, it's only around 80% effective. Not only that, but it's about 50 dollars a pill. I had to take it in 2007 and I paid 52 dollars at Walmart. Believe me, you don't want to use it regularly. And, you have to give over your personal information so they keep track of it and won't let you get it often.You can get 3 months of birth control for that same cost, which are more like 99.99% effective and actually make your periods much shorter and more manageable. <br>  It's only really good for emergencies like if your using condoms (and not on the pill) and the condom breaks, or you get raped. <br>  I love being on the pill. It's super cheap (around 17 dollars a month without insurance or benefits, around 3 dollars if you are insured/ have benefits, and you can usually get it for about 5 dollars a month from your school or health department). It make my periods drop from like 9 days to 4 days... It's just great. <br>  <br>  Stay away from using Plan B unless you absolutely have to. Believe me, taking it is NOT a good time.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	No its not an abortion pill tht is why I think this should be allowed and they should band abortions but yes you to plan b (The morning after pill)the day after you have unprotected sex it prevents pregnancy but it does not terminate a pregnancy if your pregnant plan b won't terminate the pregnancy u will still b pregnant It prevents the sperm from fertalizing the.egg so you don't end up pregnant|`|JQcIwPXJaa	It IS like an abortion in that it will not let a fertilized egg implant in your uterus.<br>  <br>  edit - it is very dangerous to use the morning after pill often. It throws your cycles off and can make you very sick (throwing up). No doc will give you them that often anyway. If you don't want a baby I suggest getting on the pill or abstaining.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	A pill containing a drug, especially an estrogen or estrogen substitute such as diethylstilbestrol, that prevents implantation of a fertilized ovum and is therefore effective as a contraceptive after sexual intercourse.|`|AA11497994	using the morning after pill every time you have unprotected sex does not make sense.if that is what you plan on doing then stop and just go on birth control pill. the main purpose for the Morning after pill is to take after unprotected sex either shortly after or with in 72hrs of havin unprotected sex.taking this pill is not having an abortion.|`|NDRiSTfUaa	the morning after pill is just in case something happens and like the condom rips or you had unprotected sex. no it is not like an abortion because what it does is it does not let the implantation occur.|`|aJjV5b95aa	No it is not like and abortion and yes you take it within 3 days of having unprotected sex. If helps prevent you from becoming pregnant.|`|ZhhH5cAdaa	NOt an abortion, <br>  You can get it at walmart for like $30 OTC<br>  it works before and after sex 3 days each way|`|wl7tlYOYaa	You should take it as soon as possible after the sex or up until 72 hours later but the longer you wait the less effective it becomes. No its not like an abortion because an egg doesnt get fertilized period so your not getting rid of a baby. You cannot use it everytime time you have unprotected sex because its very strong and has side effects like messing up your cycle  and such. go on birth control.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The morning after pill is just a high dose of birth control that prevents sperm from fertilizing an egg.  If the woman is already pregnant, it will have no effect.  The morning after pill needs to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex but it is not 100% effective.
DKqsFGymaa	Most kids master peeing before pooping in the toilet, especially boys. <br>  <br>  I don't think which potty he chooses to use is an issue.  Just let him master what he has started and then he'll move on to the next challenge. <br>  <br>  You can watch for signs from him for when he's having a BM and try to encourage him to go to the bathroom.  If he has an accident in his pants, just clean it up and tell him he should have done it on the toilet and it wouldn't have made such a big mess.  <br>  <br>  It will come.  And hopefully he will teach his twin!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0ky4TktEaa	Don't worry about it. Many children skip over those things entirely. When i was a baby, i never even used mine. I work at a daycare now and most of them don't have one at home. They use smaller version of regular toilets at school and regular toilets at home. So just let him go on the big one. Make things easier on yourself; especially if he enjoys it.  The goal is just for him to get it in A potty.<br>  <br>  If he won't go on the big one even with his little child's seat, that's another issue altogether that requires more time and sending him on a set schedule.|`|n9xYAwBRaa	just ask him if he needs to go poopy then if he does take him to the bathroom and sit with him and encourage him
nqHSQpqZaa	I've been pregnant 3 times with 2 m/c's and I have a 12 week old son. With my baby I found out when I was about 2 weeks pregnant and nobody believed me because it was so soon. I ovulated exactly 2 weeks after the first day of my previous period. I knew because my chest was sore already and I was very emotional and tired. Some people just show symptoms way sooner than others. I had every pregnancy symptom in the book before I could even get a positive test. I just knew. You could be having pregnancy symptoms, it is not too early to tell. As soon as you get pregnant your body starts producing the pregnancy hormones. Good luck and hope that you are. (:|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was 3 weeks pregnant when I found out and I was having a few symptoms at that time. I would take an early detection pregnancy test. Your symptoms may be from pms but they may also be from pregnancy. Good luck and baby dust to you!|`|ZhhH5cAdaa	anxiety.<br>  could be period symptoms too.<br>  <br>  relax.<br>  wait until you miss your period to take a test.|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	I have read that it can happen that early. In fact I have read that once fertilization occurs HGC can start to accumulate.|`|427880af15b27fb711e86ef110b31dddaa	yes your mind can play tricks on you my period was 10 days late and I'm not pregnant your body changes a lot with age but you can buy the test 5 days be for your period begins but I would wait in-till you are late so you don't have to do it again if it doesn't come in march it is a fact that a women can mentally think  she is pregnant and not be so just take care of you in till you find out 6 days after s e x is alittle to soon to tell|`|8beP9P8Aaa	HAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHHA U'RE PREGNANT!!!!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	sorry but 6 days after the egg might not even implanted yet so it would be too early to be feeling symptoms. It might just be your high anxiety because now come the waiting for your period and is it going to show or not so that tends to be stressful. Baby dust to you.|`|h4UzjZVnaa	No, you wouldn't have symptoms this soon. You most likely won't even get a positive, if you are pregnant that is, a week or 2 weeks after your missed period. Good luck though!
IDS64Eh8aa	Wow, you are one strong mummy, what you are describing would be tough with one baby, let alone twins. If you lived near me I'd love to come and help/cheer you up! Try finding out if there's a mum&baby group near you, make friends on-line, maybe some other mummy lives near you? Good luck, email me if you want to talk :)|`|FplTPoAyaa	<a href="http://nomotc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://nomotc.org/</a><br>  <br>  Try joining the above website.  It is an online support group for Mothers of Twins.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.tinyprints.com/general-information/support-for-new-moms/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.tinyprints.com/general-infor...</a><br>  <br>  This one is also a support website for new moms.  I have never been in your situation, but it sounds like you are overwhelmed.  I know it is hard, but try to take a moment for yourself every day, even if it is just to take a hot bath, meditate, or take up a hobby, such as knitting or doing crossword puzzles.  I feel for you, and just know that you are not alone.  There are many new mothers out there who face challenges everyday, just like you.  And all mothers get frustrated and feel alone at times...you are very normal.  Hope this helps.  God bless and best wishes to you.|`|oojO4WAraa	Oh, you poor thing.  That must be awful.  I am sorry you are having such a hard time right now.   This won't be forever, and soon you will be able to go out with your babies.  Sometime like video games to pass the time might help until you can go out.  Try to keep yourself busy because it will help the time pass until your babies get strong enough to go out.  Be strong, this won't last forever.  It will be spring soon and your babies will be strong and you can go to the park and the mall and show them off and go out and do stuff.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Oh you poor thing!! I'm sorry you have to go through this alone. I know what it's like to be strapped down with a baby, but two! wow! Feel free to drop me an email if you want, i'm always up for talking and keeping you company.  <br>  <br>  Prayers go out to you and your babies. Hope they get better and you don't feel so alone!|`|HvALvdc7aa	Wow. I can understand about the reflux. My 11 week old daughter has it pretty bad. I can't imagine having twins and both of them having it. That's got to be rough on you and them. We live away from our family too and I have no friends what so ever here. I guess that's why I spend so much time on yahoo. You feel like you can connect with other mothers. My hubby works as well and we rarely see each other. He is my best friend and without him I would lose it. I had the c section from hell and still haven't healed. I feel like a freak which is depressing as well. Just try to stay positive. I know its hard. My son had reflux as well and he outgrew it around 9 months. I know that seems like a long time but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Hang in there. Maybe I'll see you around yahoo :-).|`|UghJ0XROaa	I will try to help you a little, as hard as things are now, your babies won't be sick for long. Enjoy the time you are stuck in the house with them, as hard as it is. A year or two from now you will have to drag them everywhere with you, diaper bags, bottles, sippy cups, snacks, wipes, etc every time you leave the house. It's only for a short time.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Look, I've never had twins but I had three children within five years and during those five years I also lost my parents.  I only have two siblings who are sick and can't help.  I'm the one who has to help them and on my husband's side, they live far away and are not the kind of people to help.  I can certainly associate with you feeling overwhelmed and feeling lonely. My husband too works long hours but was a great help when he was home, still is.  My children are now 14, 11 and 9.  I'm a lot older than you for sure(47) but if you want to e-mail me or talk to me via messenger, it would be a pleasure for me.  I allow e-mail so if you want, you can reach me anytime.  I promise I will answer as soon as I see an e-mail from you if you decide you'd like that.  I know it's hard for now but in no time, it will be much better.|`|4SDqRs6Laa	I felt the same way (well in my mind) and I only have one baby. Kudos to you for raising twins! I admire you, no matter what you say!!! :)<br>  <br>  I gave birth in another country and had no friends or family. Only my husband who works 10 hours a day and travels 2 hours back&forth. He would even be too tired to take me out of the house on his off days sometimes. I guess it's all about mind set. Get some comic relief on dvd or youtube. Get a massage when someone is watching the babies. Get a make over and tell your husband to buy you flowers (so what if it needs to be told, if you react he'll love to see it again by buying you more on his own next time). Put on some music and slow dance with your love. At the end of the day, write down 3 things that did make you smile today, even just a little.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, you can always answer questions here. Sometimes helping others makes you feel good about yourself and puts the focus on something/someone else :)|`|7b66d2834db760280c451eeb8819e4eaaa	I know how you are feeling!  My twins were early and for the first three months we couldn't take them anywhere.  My husband was military and he worked long hours every other day and then slept every other day.  :)<br>  It is hard, very hard to be a new mom, let alone to babies that require more than just normal "baby" attention.  My twins were on medicines for reflux and apnea  monitors and all of that too!<br>  Somehow I survived it.  If it wasn't for my husband, I would have gone nuts.  But it was very hard because we had just moved and I didn't know anyone that I could ask for help.  We also couldn't have anyone over because it was the middle of winter in Montana and we couldn't risk getting them sick from someone else.<br>  Even if it is just to run quick errands, take a half an hour while you are out and get a cup of coffee alone with the quiet.  Get your twins on a schedule (if possible) and make sure to put them to bed at a good hour so you can have some quiet time before you go to sleep.  <br>  If you don't take care of yourself, you won't be in a state of mind, or physically able, to take care of your twins.  <br>  Good Luck!|`|KEoChTcdaa	You poor thing...<br>  <br>  I kind of know how you feel. My husband is in the Military, we live in a foreign country, and I have a seven month old.<br>  <br>  Not only are the people around me not the same religion, they are atheist and believe in nothing. My spouse works long hours and I went crazy with stress with my seven month old when he was first born. He was always crying and it got very frustrating. <br>  <br>  Wow...your situation is so close to what mine was. I was also on anti depressants to loosen the stress. <br>  <br>  But due to the fact that I HAVE BEEN THERE, I can offer some light at the end of the tunnel.<br>  <br>  Pray. Pray and know that you have help, you just have to call on it.<br>  <br>  And, hey, if you ever need to just talk to someone, now that my baby is pretty independent, and the house is clean, I have quite a bit of free time. Drop me an email and I would be happy to be your friend. As I said, foreign country, so I don't have many either. I hope this helps, and I will be praying for you. ^_^|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Bless your heart. It is so hard when you have little ones especially when they are sick. Have you considered a nanny/babysitter for maybe a couple of days a week? You could put an ad in your local paper and interview people. Have to give your brother and brother n law kudos though. At least they are trying, mine wouldn't even consider it...lol. Sorry I have no advice for you but I do feel bad for you and wish there was something I could do. Good luck to you and hope your little one gets well.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Oh, my dear, even without the medical problems you have experienced with your little ones, many moms feel isolated, especially when their little ones are very young. This is exactly the time when we (moms) need each other the most!<br>  <br>  I had 3 kids under 4 years old and I watched 2 others (total of 5 kids under 4 years old.) Going out was not really an option with all of them. The only other adults I saw were my husband and the mom of the two other kids. <br>  <br>  I think what you are doing is good-- reaching out via the internet. I suggest looking for an online group for moms of twins or medically needy children. I think some of these other moms have some good websites. <br>  <br>  Hang in there, mommy! You ARE doing what is right for your babies, and though difficult right now, this won't last forever!<br>  <br>  Praying for you, sweetheart!

9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Asthma in children is very difficult to control. Your daughter is on antibiotics and anti-allergy meds, as well as her asthma meds,it sounds as though they want to keep seeing her in case she gets worse. Pneumonia and RSV do present similar symptoms, the antibiotics sound like a precautionary measure in the meantime. At home, you could try propping up the end of her bed/cot with a book under each leg at the head end, just to keep her head and chest a bit higher.  I know it is frustrating when doctors tell you different things all the time but even they don't have all the answers all of the time. All they can do is treat her as they see her.     My son had asthma as a baby so I do know what you are going through. Ask to be referred to a chest specialist and trust your instincts, if she seems worse, get back to the hospital and don't take no for an answer. Hopefully the antibiotics and steroids will kick in soon and she will start to feel better. Good luck, hope she gets well soon|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Change doctors.
zXVIPLIyaa	If it isn't normal for you to miss a period, especially twice in a row then you should go to the doctor whether or not you had a negative test.  Some women don't get positive tests and if you are not pregnant there are other things that could be wrong.  you better go into your doctor and get a blood test.|`|Sj4xEMmkaa	im getting the same syptoms, but i havent done a test yet plus im eatting alot and feeling sick at the same time '    your best bet would to go see a doctor and get a test done there|`|Znqellmsaa	I would go to the doctor     good luck|`|dgRTkccBaa	You should see a doctor at this point.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Go to the doctor. Nine weeks late is over two months... You skipped two cycles. It sounds serious.
SRzswqTeaa	It sounds like your OB is itching for a scheduled birth.. either by induction or cesarean, she doesn't care as long as she doesn't have to respond to her beeper at 3am.  GRRR.  It's very possible she gave you sweep, and it kind of sounds like she did.  Thanks for asking first, doc.  You absolutely do not have to go in for an induction or a cesarean, but it really sounds like if you keep her as your ob, you are setting yourself up for an intervention filled birth.  I'd stay home as long as possible if you are not looking for a cesarean.  Remember that even in the hospital, you do not have to have Pitocin, you can simply refuse.  I cannot believe she actually told you that your labor was going to be long and difficult.  So much for SUPPORT, and encouragement that you are perfectly capable of going into labor on your own, and birthing your baby (regardless of it's size), and will have a wonderful birth experience if you put your mind to it.  BTW - your baby may not drop until labor, and is no indication of what is to come.  Good luck, I wish you the very best birth possible :-)|`|jZ6Ptkafaa	maybe you should go else where and get a second opinion|`|qYvDpa6daa	i had a membrane sweep yesturday it felt exactly the same as when i was checked at the hospital to see if i was dilated and ripe, my midwife then told me that the hospital done a membrane sweep and they didnt even tell me they had done it. it sounds to me as though u did have a sweep, but its unfair for them not to tell you there doing it. when you see them next ask them if that is what they done....their reasons for it....and the reason why they didnt let you know. i hope everything goes ok good luck|`|AA11300754	I had my membranes swept at 39 weeks and it does hurt. They aren't suppose to do it without asking you, ethically. However, it doesn't sound like your OB is a very nice one and probably wouldn't ask regardless. If you really want to try for a vaginal birth, I would just tell her. She can't force you to be induced or have a section. My OB is "induction happy" in my opinion, but I just said no. I ended up going into labor on my own on my due date but if I hadn't spoke up for myself, she would have already induced me before then. I ended up with a section anyway, but it was what had to be and because I stood up for my beliefs, I don't feel bad about it. You need to do your research and decided what you want and what you think is best for you and your baby. Write it down, make a birth plan and go over it with your OB at your next appointment. She can't force you to do anything you don't want to do.|`|GoCe3HNdaa	i think you're being pressurised here. i would seek advice. the common practice is to only intervene if medically neccesary. u should not be induced early without a good medical reason and as for a c section its alot safer to have your baby naturally again unless there is a reason why u shouldn't. common practice for most hospitals in a healthy pregnancy is to wait 10-14 days overdue b4 inducing and only given a caesarian after a vaginal birth has been attempted.|`|yB5go5wbaa	That's scary that your OB is so pro c-sections =/  The internal you had could have been a regular internal, because it's normal to bleed a little after them (especially if your baby is still very high up and you're not dilated/effaced)...BUT your doctor should have TOLD you if she was doing a membrane sweep!  I think you're too early to have that done.    Tell your obstetrician NO that you don't want a c-section - there's no reason to have one, especially BEFORE 40 weeks if you're healthy.  Your baby will come when he or she is ready.  Even after the 40 weeks, you have the right to come in for non-stress tests and ultrasounds to make sure the baby is doing fine so that you don't have to have an unnecessary c-section.  If the baby is average sized, the heartbeat is normal, and nothing else seems wrong (i.e. with amniotic fluid, baby movement, etc.), then they should wait until you're 42 weeks.  A full term pregnancy can last up until then without problems.    It sounds like they just want you to come in and out per their convenience and not from what YOU want and what is healthiest for YOU and YOUR baby.  Check out the movie "The Business of Being Born," they talk a lot about hospitals pushing their convenience onto new moms.    GOOD LUCK and don't let them cut you open!|`|ROJans2Taa	my obgyn told me when she did it, she actually asked if I wanted it done, and explained what might happen, I agreed and ended up in labor right after (39 weeks). it's possible your doc did it without asking, mine was painful and I spotted some as well, it was like a  bad contraction when she did it. im no doctor but I dont understand why she is pushing for a c-section if your only 38, most women I know that have had babies their docs give them till 41-42 weeks unless baby isnt tolerating being in there, my son was 8lbs 7 ounces when born, and I got stuck at 5 cm for like 6 hrs, but I was still able to continue vaginal delivery, I just was given pictocin, I would maybe bring up your concerns and wishes. best luck.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	you have the right ny law to hold off having an induction for 2 weeks after your due date and there is nothing they can do about it unless your putting yourself or your baby at risk which your not and it sound slike you were getting a stretsh and sweep cause my sis in law was booked in for one of thos and thats the exact symptons she had after hers. dont have a c section and i would talk to your midwife about changing hhospitals quickly you dont want to give birth in a hospital that is prone to c sections. stand up for yourself and know your rights. you can refuse a c section as long as baby and yourself are both healthy. tell them to shove it! just because baby has not engaged does not mean labour will be difficult my second did not engage till labour and i had a natural home birth with no pain relief, stitches or any assisted delivery. tell them where to go. good luck! X|`|50lIaC8zaa	I find it very strange that the doc would want you to have a CS for their convenience they usually want babies to come naturally as its better for the mother and baby, don't let them force you into having an induction or a c section unless absolutely necessary as it takes longer to recover from a CS and is all round better for the baby to come when its ready (unless more than 2 weeks late) Good luck|`|dPyfP0ijaa	Doctors try to "schedule" their babies for their own convenience.    My doc tried to induce me 4 weeks early because the @-hole was going on vacation.     I was very young and should've gotten a new doc, but didn't. I refused induction. He tried to tell me my baby couldn't be delivered if he wasn't here . .  .WTF???    Um, babies come when they come, there are rarely complications enough to need a c-section.    When I had my son several weeks later (late) my doc was there, but made me wait to push, He was at another hospital delivering another baby. They made me wait to push, my son was in the birth canal for almost 2 hours before the doc came. He was born blue, he was almost sucked out because his heart rate dropped drastically.    Luckily my son is healthy and great now, but I did change docs for my second baby.    With my daughter, I had a completely different experience, i never waited a minute to see my Doc at exams, he was very respectful as far as my wishes, my baby came when she was ready to come. The ease made everything simple and pleasant.    Do not let your doc bully you into something you don't feel is right. It's NOT too late to get a new doc. Call your hospital and ask who the doctors are that have priority. My second doc had better priority, had his own nurse staff, he got me into a private room when they had previously told me there were none before.     You shouldn't ever be scared your doc isn't treating your pregnancy the way she would treat her own.
nYI8eB0Baa	Every baby develops differently..he is fine!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Better to be safe than sorry. He should be holding his own bottle by now, but everything else sounds normal. Some kids do things early, others late. Best case scenario, someone from EI will waste a trip to your home. Your baby sounds about normal.|`|AA10526033	id change drs. thats nuts! my 2 oldest were preemies and delayed and didnt need EI. my cousin is an EI therapist and i think she would have noticed had my children needed help. heck my middle child didnt hold her bottl til she was 1, or so i thought, she always did for everyone else i just got to used to holding it for her! they didnt even crawl until 10 months or so. you could always have one come and evaluate but in my opinion your kid is perfect.
1UX6rIFmaa	Yes. names are Hyphenated to combine two proper names so they are both capitalized. If you're creating a new name and not referencing two previous names, you can do whatever you want.|`|L9MDzufnaa	Yes-Of-Course|`|n2DPxvv1aa	I have never seen it any other way.|`|LYKG72craa	Yeah, it just looks better...    FIERCE_09|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	yes, but that doesn't make hyphenated names any less retarded|`|kcrXrntnaa	yes, my first name is Jordyn-Leigh and my fiance's last name is Sheahan-Parks, so yes.=]|`|72SrLDQ3aa	You always capitalize names.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Yes|`|TYl7kmPeaa	yes|`|77NzfiVkaa	yes|`|fZGcufB7aa	Yes. There is a girl in my sister's husband's family named Joy- Anne. I think it's actually.|`|ZPxmuy2Naa	yeah, my brother's name is John-Michael and he has a middle name too|`|JsaEk8UAaa	yes|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	Yes|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Yes.|`|usXTpoSwaa	jojo|`|DP48dIxhaa	Yes|`|z0S8syYGaa	yes..unless the second name isn't really a name...ex: i've seen names like Jena-dee or Dana-lynn. I personally think it looks much better with both capitalized|`|PuVgZiddaa	yes     example: Mc Cain|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Yes because they are each separate names, and all names are capitalized.|`|7zkRvNkwaa	duhhh
auUeI2Vnaa	Yup, you might be pregnant, but since your boobs are sore before you period, maybe not.  If your period hasn't started in the next 5 or so days, I'd take a test...actually, if it were me, I'd have taken a test already.|`|QmIK2vgqaa	You are most definitely pregnant. Based on your cycle I am 99% sure you have 3-4 Mexican babies brewing in your oven.  Do yourself a favor and grab and ice pick then dive down a stairwell (twice for good measure.)|`|1WRB7RPNaa	take a test, wait a week and test again if its neg, you honestly may be pregnant|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	pre-ejaculate contains sperm and yes make you pregnant.  Withdrawal is not a reliable method.|`|dcNT65mTaa	As a man who's had that possible pregnancy scare....I'd say you're probably just late. If you haven't thrown up any, I'd say just wait a little longer for your period.I'm no expert but from all my experience with my fiance, I'd say you're just late.|`|RB2byhbYaa	don't listen to banker anal beads he is on his period and he is mad because his pregnant Mexican wife was rammed by a bus doing about 4 miles an hour. it was a bloody mess with a taco bell seasoning smell. eww|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	Have fun|`|F6jBrNmuaa	???????|`|4tWbC3GPaa	Wait for another week and take pregnancy test.|`|72JZHunmaa	I would test yourself. You might want to hury on the testing|`|n2fniR4Gaa	not really period patterns can change after some time. it might be shortening.  take a pregnancy test!! best of luck.|`|0oiz1hySaa	uhm.....it could e or just a irregular period like it will be starting at diffrenet dates but take pregence test((3 or 4)) or go to the doctor to make sure if u are or not....|`|q7sX6ACraa	it depends how old you are if your younger it could just be irregular periods wait a little longer then if you dont get your period then take a test..|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	People are stupid.    If he did not *** in you, and there was no ejaculate previous to the sex (without urination after), then you are not pregnant!    Pre-*** does NOT contain semen...it does not even come from the same part of the testicles.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	You could be pregnant. Since you're around four days late, take a pregnancy test to be sure.|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	PROTIP: If you've had sex, you could be pregnant, it doesn't matter that he didn't *** inside you.|`|Ojk7tMdxaa	It is hard to say without know how olhd you are, as the days go by your chances get better. congratualtion.|`|pmEDld6Zaa	people always get scars like this, most likely your just late. but to get rid of your nerves you should go to store and get test.|`|Q7ZyxpUoaa	probably its kinda wierd thats how my mom felt when she was pregnate of me well thats wat she said|`|oWYevEPtaa	Usually is the operative word there.  A woman's cycle is not always regular.  Maybe your cycle decided to be different this month.  It could be a change in diet or exercise, or even stress levels.  Chances are you are just about to get it! Don't fret!|`|rev4lrn0aa	You could be pregnant since you are already late, a pregnancy test should be able to detect that. Tender breasts could either be a sign of pregnancy but they also get tender sometimes right before you get your period. I would wait it out a couple more days and then take a test if it still hasn't come. Good luck, I hope it works out the way you want it to!|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	take a test   what do you mean he didnt come..?  like inside you or at all??  well either way if he wasnt wearing a condom theres a huggeee chance you are|`|XOlnc8iBaa	If your last period was jan 5 the next should be anyday. Try to relax and dont have unprotected sex again.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi sounds like you should take a test. you must be pregnant. just because he says he never came does not mean he did not pre-***. do a test. good luck.|`|hoX7hoINaa	The tenderness could just be your period is on the way, just a bit later than usual. You're only a few days late, might just be an off month. But if it doesn't show up in a couple more days, then test.|`|Nvrwsf5zaa	you can try those pregnancy test kit. use it with your first pee in the morning.they are reliable results. can get them in your pharmacy.|`|AA10572259	The easiest way to tell is go take a pregnancy test.  There is always a chance you could get pregnant when you have sex, he doesn't have to come for that to happen.      If you want to be pregnant then it sounds like you are on the right track counting your days so you know about when you expect your period.  You should also be able to find a calculator online that can tell you about the time you will ovulate.  Then you should have sex during that time.  Or you could just have sex every other day.    If you don't want to be pregnant then you should be using birth control and or condoms.  I'm sure you know that though.    I remember my breasts being super tender the days before I had my positive test.  I was also really moody.     Good luck.|`|y3HLL203aa	You definitely want to take a test and find out for sure. For the sake of your peace of mind and if you are pregnant for the sake of your pregnancy, whatever your decision may be. Take the test and best of luck.|`|CnfsoT3Daa	if you had the sex a week or two ago, it will be to early to take a test. go see your doctor.. they'll be able to tell for sure..    oh , and if your boyfriend had an erection, he cummed..if he didn't ..maybe he should go to a doctor.. i don't know if that's healthy or not.. i don't remember..|`|qE6BlyCFaa	sure...unprotected sex is how babies are made    but i am not a stick and u didnt pee on me soo i cant give u an answer|`|FX0kDKpbaa	it could be late but get a test to make sure|`|xlMtgNT9aa	I would say wait another week or so.   sometimes your period can be really late and if you are too stressed out, you could miss it all together|`|m1yZib20aa	you might be. I would check with a doctor or get tested|`|ziL1Yo8xaa	Well the natural lube. from  the man's doiongs-  It does include sperm most of the time.    You should take a test.  But don't freak out.|`|5looQMxiaa	Your Probaly just late... no worrie unless you start feeling sick.|`|3fb275a16b34625e77b7d5b261c181e8aa	i think this site may be very useful for you :  http://www.thepregnancytester.com/|`|pMLsrwFSaa	Maybe some signs of pregnancy are:  A missed period, Morning sickness,  Tender, swollen breasts, Food cravings etc...|`|CZQyPJSYaa	My period hasn't came in a while, almost like 2 months But its because i run all the time. It can be anything, a change in your eating habits or exercising, like mine. But seeing how you've had unprotected sex...really stupid if your not ready, you might just want to get a test you know to be sure.    best wishes!|`|RvMguG2saa	im 14, and i have not had sex. at all. but randomly, my period decided to switch weeks a few months ago. i have had a regular menstrual cycle for at least a year and a half, so i dont knoowww... i dont think you are pregnant if you are starting your cycle because the uteral lining is needed for the pregnancy, but if you have not bled yet, i would get a test. just in case.
Qp79sBF7aa	If I understand your question, you have to see a gynecologist to get birth conrol pills.  They cost about $25 a month I think but it depends on your insurance.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Google your local health clinic.. you can get very cheap birth control from there.
xreWOKBYaa	You can tell you are pregnant 5 days before your missed period using an at home test. A blood test can tell you are pregnant even sooner.|`|8ZgwtbwEaa	You CAN get pregnant in 2 hours... But there wouldnt be enough hormone in her body to detect it in 5 days.  Sounds like a wind up to me.  Even if she is I doubt very much that it's yours.....   Learn your lesson from this and be safe. x|`|1WRB7RPNaa	no, she is not pregnant. what i mean is that, she would not know for sure she was pregnant 2 days after having sex, it takes about 2 to 3 weeks to find out, its quite a process, and her body needs to start producing HCG before she would know that she was pregnant, your body wouldnt produce that 2 days later|`|H74F8jxuaa	Not likely for her to be pregnant.|`|4tWbC3GPaa	not possible. ovulation happens between 14-20 days of every cycle. Depends on your girl's cycle.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yeah that sounds a little fishy to me. It usually takes about 2 weeks or so after pregnancy begins to get a positive on a urine test at home. I know the blood tests at the doctor's offices are more sensitive and pick up any hormone in the system, but still that seems really soon.|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	I think shes trying to set you up. If she is pregnant have a DNA test after the kid is born|`|qbMCd2myaa	not likely.|`|j7l9gavRaa	it could happen you'd be surprised    if the tests are coming up positive she needs to talk to a doctor ASAP|`|A8k9NHigaa	Is it posible she is pregnant yes, there is always a chance if a condom broke. However, if she was to get her period the day after yall had sex then no, she had already ovulated for the month, so she could not get pregnant for that cycle. If she is pg it isn't yours rest easy. But my thoughts she is lying about being pregnant for some reason.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Ovulation usually occurs about mid-cycle, and that's when a woman can get pregnant.  It would be unusual, but not totally impossible, to get pregnant right before the period is due.  This girl sounds like a manipulative loser.  Ask for some evidence that she's pregnant.|`|rev4lrn0aa	She is probably not pregnant. It should definitely take longer for the pregnancy hormone to be able to be detected in a test. Also, she likely wouldn't be ovulating then (which she would have to be ovulating to get pregnant). Usually women ovulate about 2 weeks after their period. She is probably lying, there is like a 2% chance that she is actually pregnant. Good luck.|`|qDBjH4s8aa	The hormones level, even for a blood test would not register a pregnancy at 5 days post condom breakage. Implantation hasn't even occurred yet. She's possibly pregnant, but not from the broken condom incident. More likely than not, its from another encounter about a month ago.|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	not shes probably lying if shes not its not yours!!  it takes at least a week after sex to get a postitive test usually 2wks or more though!|`|1gooDEfLaa	DUH!! you can get pregnant at anytime of the month|`|YuA7a08Maa	It's not likely.  I got a positive 11 days after conception.  Almost no woman can get a positive before 9 days after conception.  She may be lying to you or you may have gotten her pregnant at an earlier time.  Good luck!|`|NLTnazU4aa	Um if she is pregnant you might want to ask her who else has she been sleeping with because I think she was already pregnant|`|GuH6LctIaa	the most accurate answer here is... no. not after 2 days.    it wont even show in a test till atleast usually 4-6 weeks.    It is possible she is pregnant...but if she didnt have sex with you the past month or so...then she obviously did with someone else.|`|QBpJxWCmaa	If it broke its definatly possible but the fact that she would know already is doubtful!  If you have problems with those things breaking tell her to get on the pill.  Unless you are ready for a whole new responsiblity!!!  A lot of condoms also have a spermiside if yours contained that then youre probably not going to be a father just yet.|`|pR2gXzYeaa	No way. A blood test takes about seven days and the piss test takes longer.|`|fBBJlXBCaa	first of all, if she tested and it says shes pregnant.. then duhhhh apparently IT IS POSSIBLE..    but the chances that she were to get pregnant a day before her period, thats unlikely because a woman's egg is released about 14 days before her period, the egg stays there for about 24 hrs or less and if theres no sperm present she begins her menstrual cycle. either shes not very in tune with her cycle, or her egg was released a lot later and she wasn't really goign to get her period when she was expecting.    but under any circumstances.. anything is possible.. so any time any day of the month is possible for a woman to conceive..
HRFaAyKOaa	Hello! Our little man did this same exact thing. And, he hated being on his belly. We gave it some time (dealing with the crying for a few minutes and then helping him out) and he has figured it out on his own now.  It was tough for a few weeks, but now everything has been going  really well. When he realizes he's on his tummy and is not happy about it, he rolls back over on his own quickly, with no complaints!|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Wow. That was rude.     Anyway, This only happened to my boy once. He never cries, he is too easy going, so when I heard him screaming in bed, I ran in there and he was on his hands and knees. I just don't think he knew what to do. He hasn't done it since, so I don't know what help to offer. Maybe lavender baths to put her in a deep sleep. Also, how about a voice activated light that will turn on for 15 min. So if she wakes and makes a peep, maybe she can see what's going on and figure out how to turn herself back over??|`|FHT6wsUpaa	Don't worry - it won't last long. My daughter did the same thing at that age, and within a couple of weeks she was rolling herself back over with no problem. Just wait till your little one pulls to standing and can't figure out how to sit back down! It'll be the same feeling all over again (albeit, probably not as sleep disruptive). Good luck and hang in there.|`|yYzYbivzaa	idk, but she must be really fat! figure out ur baby problems by urself!!!|`|AA10526033	my 4 month old did that once and got really mad. i really dont have any ideas if you have already tried the wedges! seems like being on her tummy just wakes her up and she doesnt wanna be asleep!
DPegPYRPaa	Go with Christina's answer.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	My nephew used to do that. and he did it HARD. If he didn't get his way he would act fine with it then you turn your back and he's run up to you and bite you as hard as he could. (and then laughed about it) Often making the person bleed. Well one day after he had bitten me so hard that I was bleeding I bit him back. He was so amazed! He didn't know what to do! I didn't make him bleed or do it as hard as he bit us but I did it hard enough to make him see it hurts. He never bit me again. It seems harsh but smacking his hand didn't work. I guess knowing the pain he caused other people hurts he knew why it was so bad.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	This is going to sound really bad, but I too have 4 children, they are teens now but boy oh boy do i remember when they were all babies..i had 4 boys 2 years apart!  Ok..here's the bad part...adn I did spank them when they were little on their diapered tushes or on the hand ...I had one that bit and all I had to do was gently but firmly bite him  on his hand...not even enough to leave the slightest mark, but the action scared  him enough and him listening to me say "We don't bite..it hurts" really worked...|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think I would have to spank her.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Spank her. If she likes to cause pain and hurt others, show her how it feels.|`|GhKz1MyXaa	Next time she bites make her look you in the eyes and say [name] biting is not allowed and if you do it again you're going to time out. You should get a jar of marbles and when she does something good put a marble in the jar even if she just says please or thank you but if she has to go to time out take a marble out. When she gets maybe like 30 or so marbles give her something special like take her out for ice cream or something. Remember kids need motivation. I have started this with my 3 year old and she hardly ever acts out anymore. Whatever you do don't spank her she will think it i ok to be aggresive.|`|IbTLneAFaa	Above all, keep calm. If the bitten person reacts too much--and I know it's hard not to... lord how I know--it shows the biter that when she bites, she gets a free show.    Spanking, hitting, and biting back may seem to work, because the stop the behavior immediately, but like most instant gratification solutions, it only encourages aggressive (and worse) behavior in the long run.
DPegPYRPaa	Prunejuice helps, but don't overdo it or you will be sorry!|`|bmoCpcdraa	juice|`|pPJcg5GGaa	i have a three year old son who was constipated and hadnt had a bowel movement for  two days we took him the doctors and they gave him constipation medcine and he went the toilet within hours of taking it.take her to the doctors just incase.|`|9LWuWHiMaa	you do not have to take this advice but here goes. when i was a child my used to cut a small piece of soap and insert it into my buttocks and in a little while pop goes the weasle. But if that is too much for you the prune juice is good but even better is water she needs water he poop is dry also mommy needs to increase the childs fiber so this does not happen again. whole wheat pasta, bread, wheat germ, bran or flaxseed in cereals (hot or cold), yogurt or ice cream and ensure that she gets at least 8oz of water daily. but if palin old water or prune juice does not do the work take her to the emergency room. it might be fecal impaction.|`|GE68lOBEaa	Prune juice or plenty of water. I have heard pears are meant to be very good to get bowel movement going.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	All Sydwarkev's suggestions are correct.  The dietary changes will prevent the constipation from recurring but for now - if your girl still hasn't "done" yet and needs fast-acting relief - try the soap.    Make sure you use only unscented ivory or glycerin soap - cut off a small sliver or nugget of the soap, put vaseline on your girl's butthole and push the soap all the way in.  Make sure she retains it.  Guarantee it'll help her do a dooey in 5-20 minutes!|`|EjsjoD81aa	Hi I have Had The Same Problem With My Daughter. try Giving Her Some Prune Juice Or Orange Juice This Seems to Help. Also If he Has A bottle or a sippy Cup Put A Teaspoon Of Brown Sugar In There She Wont Taste It If Its With Milk. If That Dont Work Take Her to the Pharmacy And They Will Give You chocolate Flavoured Laxatives She Wont Even Know.. Hope This Helps.
4cprznZcaa	she needs to talk to a parent or a school counselor. this is an abusive relationship and it sounds like it is escalating. he has emotional issues and needs to get help. if he is forcing her to have sex then that is rape. he is controling and abusive and she should get out as soon as possible, the longer she stays the worst it will get. she is not responsible for his happiness or life, if he threatens to quit school then thats his decision, and as for the suicide its probably unlikely that he will do it, but he really needs to get some help.  please talk to someone! good luck|`|1CuTF8qOaa	This is the exact sign ob abuse,   I mean SLAPPING.  This boy better know his place.|`|Mjni0Np3aa	I would call the police. Report that he is abusing her (because he is), maybe get a restraining order or press charges.|`|Crh2zRGcaa	In alot of abusive relationships threats like 'ill kill myself are very common' and are used simply as scare tactics. She needs to break it off with him as soon as possible, break of all ties with him and get the support of you (her friends) and her family. If you need further advice all helplines such as childline will have good information. If she needs to break up with him it would not be wise for her to meet him face to face especially not alone if shes going to be seeing him at school she will need her friends around her. If further threats or any unwanted contact is carried out after this it is acceptable to contact the police and ask that the school does something to keep him at distance.|`|MP7KFFTmaa	wow she should get out of that relationship asap. tell an adult? a police officer, maybe?|`|5tqh0akYaa	it could be. He might just be really controlling but it sounds like mental abuse and possibly physical. you need to talk to her and try to get her to break up with him. i don't think he will actually do those things and if he does it isn't her fault. she needs help and if she doesn't listen talk to her parents.      best of luck for you and your friend|`|oGHtaaCkaa	You both need to tell an adult.   If a guy slaps you then you shouldn't have to think twice about whether or not you should break up with him...  Him saying he'll kill himself is just a pathetic lie to get her to stay so he can abuse her more.|`|PExOJJLgaa	These are obvious signs of abuse.  Please help get her out of that relationship!  I'm pretty sure she's struggling to get out herself!|`|t0c9sfEkaa	well if she is being hurt then u definetley need 2 get her help|`|pYHfZODGaa	ha i read the article in the magazine too. and slapping a girl across the face is not right for a boy to do. at all. it's wrong.  you need to tell someone you trust. an older sister, your mother, a teacher, or a guidance counselor at school. forcing her to have sex is pushing it too far. he needs to be dumped. he's dangerious and it's time he gets what he deserves.|`|JdFgf575aa	Call 911

Both you and the father show up and present your case. If the father objects, he says so, and the judge will decide from there.    Edit: I live in California, and I know laws very from state to state. Your best bet is to go on an official website for your state and county, or like I said, call or visit your court house.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	It's easier if you don't know where the dad is. I don't if that's the case, but if it is, you simply need to post an add in ANY newspaper informing the public that your child's name will be changed. This is done so the father has a chance to see that his child's name is being changed and can have a chance to come forward and fight it. Otherwise, it's smooth sailing from there. It does cost money though!|`|flqAr30laa	im not really sure, maybe you should ask this in the law section.|`|0LsRbK2iaa	i think that you probably should from wut i hear but he still is his dad and if he does fight it wont it be harder for you to explain to him why and stuff|`|eeGN977eaa	We changed my step-son's last name when my husband received full custody. He did not need the bio mom's consent. I think the best way for you to find out for sure is to make a quick call to a local attorney and ask. Most attorneys are more than happy to answer quick and simple legal questions.
Osn1xpu6aa	Ask him if he wants to hang out sometime.  You should do this with an actual idea in mind (movies etc etc).    "hey, wanna go see _________ or go do________ on saturday?"  Don't say it in a way that hints that you like him, just do it as a friend sort of thing. See how he responds, you can measure how much a guy likes you by doing that.|`|v05RzzCEaa	be like..  YO! you and me be chillen some time! aiiiiight!   boom bang bing, done.|`|cqW3NhqVaa	say, hey do you want to hang out?    not hard. if he gets teased alot, he will appreciate any  attention from a girl.|`|1CuTF8qOaa	mabye if he find out he has a thing for you,  you could be like..    i like you and you like me..how about we try somthing out.   (then tell him a specific movie ect.)
D0y3MwDcaa	GREAT compriomise!! (:|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I went to school with an 4th  He hated his first name, so did his  father who when by his middle name.  He hated it more that his father hated a name, and named him it anyway    If he likes his name, I guess it's okay    I know people who use their middle first name, so they had the same name, but different first names|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I named the baby after my husband but not his middle name so no Jr was involved.  I think Moms should have final choice.  Compromise is always best.|`|xpUyH0psaa	it sounds like a good plan though i would still ask him if he likes the girl name before making it final.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	My husband and I did this except we didn't name our son after him. Before we knew what we were having, he decided a boys name and I chose a girls name. Of course, we shared the names with each other to make sure there was no disagreement.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	sweet?
2arZOZWgaa	Nothing is wrong with you. Many, many people feel just the same way that you do. You are by no means alone. Many mothers feel resentment towards their husbands who get out everyday, go to an office and talk with adults, have someone serve them lunch at a restaurant. Even if it is work.    As for some suggestions: Could you place her in a once-a-week program to give yourself a break? Your husband could drop her off on his way to work possibly. What is it about your apartment that you hate? Spruce it up somehow, make a spot in the home that is just for you where you can retreat to and be left alone. Could you enroll in some online classes to stimulate you mentally? Even if you don't enroll in a whole degree oriented program, you could learn more about something of interest to you like a literature course where most of your homework would be reading. Could you ship her off to grandmother's for a week? Just so you can rehash and relax by yourself. Absence really does make the heart grow fonder and you will get a chance to feel like an adult again. You will be dying for baby to come back home after a few days.  Try to remember why it is that you decided to stay home.    You will regret not making the most of the time you have when your baby is this little, as like they say, "they grow up so quickly" and you will believe it or not miss these times. You need to find a way to communicate these needs with your husband. Don't whine and complain to him as we ladies sometimes have a tendency to do. Instead be as straightforward and to the point as you can. Decide on your plan beforehand and then lay out for him step by step what you need him to do to get the ball rolling.     I felt very much (and still do) the same way when my daughter hit 8 months. I live in the middle of nowhere (public transportation is not an option, they won't even deliver a pizza out here). I am pregnant with my second child (they will be a mere 11 months apart). I dropped out of college to stay home with them till they are old enough to do whatever is it we decide to do with them. They won't be going to school (We will home school them) and they certainly won't be going to day care full time. I am absolutely dying to go back and finish my degree. Many days I feel like I would much rather work than stay home, but that is the sacrifice I am making right now to give them what I feel is best. And yeah, it sucks, but my babies deserves the best and that's the decision I made when I had them.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	actually, you sound depressed to me; i would def see a doc and talk it over with them, and if they prescribe you a med, take it; you shouldn't have to feel this bad; you should be able to enjoy your baby, plus baby needs an emotionally happy mother......see if maybe u guys can set aside a little money each month and get a decent used car for you; it would help if u could get out as well...we already had 3 vehicles, but none were baby friendly...a big truck, a small porsche and a camaro, LOL; so we got a maxima that has some miles on it from my sil's mom; she only charged us 2000 dollars, and it is so much easier to take baby in and out...this is the first car i have ever had with four doors, and i have never ever had a trunk!! i thought i would  hate it, but i really do like having a trunk!! and it's in good shape, never wrecked or anything...you might have to do some shopping around, and i would suggest a private person instead of a car lot, but u can find a deal if  u keep ur eyes open!!|`|JsaEk8UAaa	when the weather breaks grab a stroller an get out in the shine!!!|`|dwdLkvgPaa	can you take the bus to get away from your apartment for awhile during the day...|`|txbZujeRaa	nothing.  I think we all feel like that from time to time.  My husband works a lot and has to travel sometimes, so it's just me and the 6 mos old most of the time.  I find myself getting mad at him (the husband) for no reason, or overreacting for little things he does wrong.  Being a mom is just hard sometimes.  I just hired a high school girl to watch mine once or twice a week at min. wage.  Try to get that if you can.  Ask around at a church for someone trustworthy.  So you can get out and clear your head.  It makes a huge difference.  You have to take care of yourself too so you can be a good mom.  If you are miserable, you aren't helping anyone.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I think you have cabin fever.  Start going out more maybe your one friend can drive you places?|`|hdzlWALdaa	vent! :) i'll listen dnt wry hehe. my son is gna be 8months this month.    EDIT -- im a sinle mum so i also hav things to complain bout lol. i dnt drive n i wish i "sat" at home at all! i only get chance to at this time (midnight) whilst he's aslp.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Do you think you have postpartum depression? You might want to mention it to your doctor just in case. Being a stay-at-home mom is NOT easy, especially if you're stuck at home. But if you have ppd, it could seem unbearable. Good luck.
NQ2sDQMRaa	they have surrogate agencies here, you'll have to pay for an egg i assume, and the pregnant women will just be the vesel that makes the baby grow, they will take your sperm and a donor eggs and create embryos which they implant in the surrogate so that woman wont have any legal right over your baby. warning: its expensive, very very expensive|`|2xS1Jro7aa	and what if the child is a boy?|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Why don't you just adopt?  All American women do not participate in the horrendous practice you described in your second paragraph.  Just FYI.
hoX7hoINaa	As long as its not tinged with red, pink, brown, or an odd color, you do not need to be worried. Discharge will slowly increase as you progress.|`|0f9203abf664214ebc6d4a6e58a82307aa	Discharge is very common and normal while pregnant. As long as it doesn't smell bad, it's fine. Talk to you doc about it.  I am 35 weeks PG and I have had some major discharge this entire pregnancy.|`|A1KwOUFCaa	With my son I used to have spotting from week 7 to 12 and I'm pregnant again and the same thing happened. I had an ultrsound both times and it was normal. They couldnt find the root of it. I think it is ok as long as it's not tinged with blood. Next time you're at your doctors, you should gte him to check it out.|`|utyBYnrBaa	No discharge while you are pregnant is natural
vYKrRWOwaa	It doesn't sound like pregnancy. But there are some questions you should answer, such as if your menstrual cycle usually like clockwork or are your periods hit and miss?    If it were me, I would go to Walmart and get a home pregnancy test just to put my mind at ease.  I think they have ones now that can detect pregnancy before the first day of a missed period.    If your symptoms (spotting and puking) continue for another day, then you really need to go see a doctor.  If you don't have insurance, then find a local health clinic or Planned Parenthood location.  Seriously, because it could be something else all together.    It's scary when something is wrong and you don't know what it is. I hope everything works out for you.|`|UgcPxd4maa	sounds like you need to go to the doctor, or get an HPT.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I dunno. Its usually too early to be having morning sickness already. maybe you just caught a bug or something. Also, there are many other reasons why a person might bleed or spot a little inbetween their cycles. I would just wait and see if you get your next period, then if you don't take a test to find out for sure.|`|bTlhBX3daa	Well, from your symptoms, it could be a lot of things. But you're right, it's possible that you are pregnant and experiencing Implantation bleeding and morning sickness. The reason you are throwing up what looks like yellow egg yolk, is just because there is nothing else in your system to throw up or you have already thrown it up.     You can try taking a test, but keep in mind that it might be too early, and even if it's negative, you should wait a couple weeks and test again to be sure.|`|JdmwlvSRaa	if u had a sex without protection or the condom broke and sperm goes in your part. then nodought u r pregnent and if u r a virgin then dont worry u r not pregnnt|`|pxTsBlOMaa	you don't start morning sickness until about 3rd month.   go to the doctors.
gx4s68s8aa	I started to have severe nausea again since week 29.  Now I am 31 weeks and went to my doctor.  Always before I went without the nausea medicine, but this time I asked for Zofran.  I will start it tomorrow and I hear it is great.  So you really might want to call your doctor today.  They may call the prescription in for you without you having to go in.     I never went on Zofran before because my really bad nausea was always in the first trimester mainly.  But now I need to gain weight, and that is not going to happen with me vomiting several times a day.  And regardless of my weight, I have so much to do to get ready for the new baby.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	it says in the pregnancy books that nausea can make a reappearance in the late third trimester and i've  been having it too, but luckily i have a prescription that takes care of it i dotn know wat to say to help you, none of th "tricks" like crackers and stupid stuff like that ever worked on me.|`|b3CwObBdaa	serious bad morning sickness during the first and now the third trimester.  as back then, i take comfort in knowing that the baby will take what it needs from me and I will be the one doing without.
DnyyyGeEaa	My little cousin was coloring an elephant green and I said elephants arent green they are purple and she said "Im coloring in spanish" it was so cute!!!! Then also this one time my sister and I took her to the zoo and we had gotten some popcorn and my sister and I were complaining that it was burnt. So throughout the circus my cousin saw a taco johns logo and said taco johns and I was like oh my she can read so i had her read what the popcorn bag said and it said fresh popcorn and she was all "burnt popcorn" lol it was so funn!!! I am laughing now!|`|h6kTWuNVaa	laughing like crazy, these answers are SO FUNNY! I love it when little kids say off the wall stuff.

ibWLdXlJaa	It"s your choice but I do know someone who got pregnant at 14 had him at 15 and still finished school. She then went on to college and became an RN at our cancer center. It's not the end of your career unless you let it be. Just because your sister is giving her baby up doesn't mean you can't do the same. You should NEVER have an abortion just so people won't think bad of you. Your sister will hate you more if you do go through an abortion. Sorry I can't think of any positives to have having an abortion.|`|phwivaqNaa	You obviously like children because of the major you want to go into.  At the same time I understand how this puts a wrench in things.  The timing is bad with when college will start, but I would consider adoption.   As hard as it is, it at least gives the baby a chance.  There is someone inside of you with a beating heart that is depending on you to protect it.      My sister is desperately trying to get pregnant right now.  It makes her cry because of how easy it is for some people.  Dont under estimate how powerful a thing that is and take it for granted.    Worse case scenario is you work through fall and start school in the new year.  You can make up for it over the summer.  You will see the baby and hear the heartbeat at your appoitment and you wont truly know how you feel until you see that.    There was an ad rejected my the Superbowl.  You can see it on you tube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2CaBR3z8...    Makes you stop and think what could be!|`|ffAmoqFTaa	Everything happens for a reason, you should have the baby and see where life takes you - just because your plans aren't going to play out the way you had expected doesn't mean your life is ruined.  Talk to your boyfriend, he can still be in the military if he has a baby.  Good luck!|`|dRo89MsYaa	i'm 19 and pregnant, and I still plan on going to college. you can get help to raise the child until your boyfriend comes home and as long as you're financially stable then you'll be fine. in fact, why not ask your sister to help you with the baby while you're in school? that way she can get a feel for what it will be like to be a mother. abortion is taking an innocent life, so no it's not a good option. adoption is a good option, but also makes some kids feel unwanted when they find out they were adopted.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Maybe your sister can adopt your baby? And why on earth would you tell someone whose been trying to conceive and not getting pregnant, that you just want to abort your baby?!?! That is the last person you tell if you do.  Carry your baby, have your married sister and her husband adopt it, and that way you don't have to kill your baby and you will see it often enough.  Put your college plans on hold. And go after the baby is born.    Makes sense to me.  Your sister wants a baby. And you really, really don't want to kill yours.|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	I don't understand why you feel adoption isn't an option, just because your sister is doing it?    My son was a surprise, when I had him, I was at a community college planning on transferring to a univ.  A month & a half after he turned one, I got my associates & transferred the following fall (07).  I should be graduating with my Bachelors this spring.    A baby doesn't have to "ruin" your plans.  You may have to change things but you can still accomplish the things you want, by being a parent or even giving it up for adoption.|`|Q0DLGuGwaa	fine kill the baby and ruin four peoples lives at least, one the baby's you would have killed it, two and three the new mother and father that could adopt this child and take care of it millions of people are desperate to adopt, and four, your own you will regret abortion and it will ruin your life to some degree
BbfNMXtiaa	No one can make you do anything. Even if it is for the safety of the baby, as long as it is still inside you, you are in control. It would be a giant lawsuit if you refused and they did something to you to force you to have an unwanted surgery. People who say they were forced to have a c-section may have been convinced, or even coerced, but they may not have known that ultimately they could have refused. Of course, that doctor may have refused to deliver the baby, and that would be their right too. The important thing is to find an OB or midwife that agrees with your views on birth to begin with, and be sure they will respect your wishes. Too many people settle for doctors that they don't agree with because they don't realize that they can change doctors! If you don't like your doctor, find someone else.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	It just depends on what's best for the baby. If they say... your babies going to die if we don't do a C section you COULD say no. The reason they do C-Sections for women who have all ready had them is safety... if there was a problem before, they don't want it to occur again. What ever is safest for my baby is what I'll do. I've had all mine natural though.|`|4a2b1a81a9c8031e2a999ddf51108881aa	Hospitals cannot (CANNOT) do a v-bac (Vaginal birth after c-section) unless they are staffed with anesthesiologists ON SITE 24/7.  So, if you go to a hospital who has anesthesiologists on-call for the nights and weekends, they will not do a vaginal delivery after you've had a c-section.  They can "make" you if you choose to deliver there.    However, chances are another hospital in the area (that your OB is affiliated with) has the anesthesiologists staffed to do the v-bac.  Do some research to find out before you settle on any one place...    (Actually, hospitals CAN turn patients away in active labor.  I work in a hosptial - in the Maternal/Child division, which is L&D, Maternity/Nsy/SCN, and Pediatrics - and a different local hospital's anesthesia group walked out on them.  Every patient that came in with a potential emergency OR case or active labor was transported - by ambulance, on the hospital's tab - to other nearby facilities.)|`|5ViTUTyZaa	That is some hospitals policies.  I don't know what they would do if you just show up.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Since I had a c-section before (my induction didn't work and since I have to be on blood thinners, I had a small window of time to give birth)  I have to have a c-section.  My doctor doesn't do VBACs for anyone.  And she said I wouldn't be a good candiate anyway.  So if I want to keep my doctor then I have to have a c-section.  I am not looking forward to it, and if I had any other choice I would try VBAC.  My doctor is a wonderful doctor and she saved my life with the first pregnancy, so I wouldn't consider going anywhere else.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	They will make you sign a waiver refusing treatment at the least which releases them from any liability related to any issues relating to you delivering VBAC.  I'm not positive about this instance specifically, but generally speaking they can not turn a woman away that shows up in active labor...now if she refuses a procedure they mandate as necessary I'm not sure if or how that would change what they can do.      Personally, I'd research out the nearest hospital that does VBACs.  I actually discussed this with MY OBGYN before deciding to have a c-section.  He said he would treat me and help to refer me to a doctor with rights at the nearest hospital that performs VBACs if that were my wish.|`|AA10186411	No they can't.  But would you really want to risk your child's life?  I mean really, whats more important here?  Your wishes, or your child's life?|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No, they can't make you.  But i'm sure they'll have you sign all sorts of forms releasing them from liability if you choose to ignore the doctors recommendation.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	They can't "make" you do anything. The reason women say that is bc a vaginal delivery after a C section can be dangerous. It can cause your uterus to rupture. Some women do elect a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) and do fine but it is risky. So most Drs just automatically, from the beginning of your pregnancy, want you to do a c section again if you had one the first time. It is safer. But I guess if you refused a c section they would go ahead and try to deliver vaginally but inform you that you or your baby could die from it and you would have to take your chances.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I think you misunderstand.     Depending on how a previous c-section surgery was performed, it may not be possible for a woman to safely have a vbac. You can literally rupture your uterus if you try.  It's not like some random thing being forced on these women. It's literally the difference between harming themselves and the baby vs. not.     This is an interesting legal question. You as an adult can generally refuse medical treatment but I'm not certain if the hospitals can allow you to choose to put your child's health at risk. They certainly don't ask women who need emergency c-sections if they want them or not.     I am inclined to think that you cannot refuse one if your doctor feels its needed without suffering some consequences.|`|X9qrMXQiaa	if you haven't talk to your doctor about other arrangements then they could try hard to force the issue for your safety and that of your unborn child|`|xue72D76aa	There is a difference between an emergency c-section and a more elective procedure.  There are certain emergency situations that will result in an immediate c-section.  In those cases, there really isn't a choice - it's c-section or risk losing the baby and/or mother.  In most other c-section situations, it is elective.  A doctor may lean towards a c-section for a variety of reasons (ultrasound shows a large baby, past history of c-section, going over your due date) but it is still your body and your right to say you'd like to try for a natural birth.  You can always ask for a "trial of labor" before deciding if you want to go with a c-section.

TM3pNz6kaa	i would be asking for a closer dr appointment and or an ultrasound they are usually to determine if everything is ok and how far along you are, did you get confirmed you are actually Pregnant? Doctor should have organized an ultrasound for you then.    I would be looking for another doctor if it takes this long to get in cuz if you have had a MC then you need to be seen to ASAP so to not get any sicker.    Sorry not much help but good luck|`|xuGAxZ0Vaa	Huh?|`|QBpJxWCmaa	Not sure of youre question.  Id relax and wait for your appointment. I know its easier said then done but really there is nothing you can do.  The baby could be fine... or it could be a misscarriage.  There is nothing wrong with you if it is.  It just sometimes happens.  Think of this... if it is a misscarriage their was no baby it was a mismatch bunch of genes and cells that didnt work out right.  I went threw this 3 years ago.  My thougths are with you!! Best wishes!!

gAPwYArkaa	When i really wanted a guinea pig this is what i did.  i asked her and she said no because i already have a budgie a cat and a dog and she says i have to many animals i dont take care of, but then with out her even asking i started cleaning the birds cage once a week taking the dog for walks and cleaning the litter box. all on my own without being asked. i was also on my besssst behavior and i payed for it myself. just dont point out that your doing the work and let her notice on her own. save up your money and then if you ask her again in a month or so see if she changes her mind. if the answer is still no get something cool like a huge fish tank with tropical fish. in my opinion i wouldnt get a chinchilla because they are loud, they bite, and hate being picked up or petted. and they may be cute but they really are not nice and cuddly animals. if you want something in that nature try a guinea pig. they are soooo sweet they love to pur and cuddle by your ear,they squeak and its soooooooooooooooooo cute, theres so many varietys and they suit any personality. they never ever bite. i would highly recomend a guinea pig.  hope i helped  :)|`|0vLU2GGGaa	I use to have a chinchila, they are very cute, but, they are not very good companion pet.  A dog and a cat is different, they will play with you and try to get your attention, but chinchila is very independent, they don't really care about you much.

MtC3CWZraa	The key with dairy is that it MUST be pasteurized. Check the ingredient labels. If you see "pasteurized milk" you're fine. Pasteurization removes the risk of listeria.     Just avoid anything made with raw milk. It's usually not an issue with US made cheeses since federal guidelines require it, but imported cheese aren't always made from pasteurized milk.|`|YuA7a08Maa	I dunno about creme fraiche...but you can have anything that says pasteurized on the container.  Good luck!|`|jLNwrVZRaa	As long as it is pasteurized then it is ok to eat.  If it doesn't say then I wouldn't risk it.
oP504BtFaa	Honestly, it depends on what time they wake up. Children that age need 8 - 9 hours of sleep, so if they need to wake up at 7, going to bed at 10 is sufficient. If they need to wake up at 6, however, going to bed at 8:30/9:00 would be more appropriate. Getting more than ten hours of sleep can have the opposite affect of a good night's sleep - when you wake up, you can have a headache from oversleeping and feel groggy.    From the time your child wakes up, count backwards 8 or 9 hours and that is the time they should be in bed. Or you could have them bed for a half hour before that, so they have time to settle down. Everyone knows just because you go to bed at 9 doesn't mean you go to SLEEP at nine, right?|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	I was going to bed by myself at that point. But my friends had to be in bed by 9 9:30 at the latest.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	9pm|`|A1PLJKhUaa	9 on school nights and not after eleven on the weekends|`|2bkS1VIIaa	she should go to sleep at 9pm and on weekends on 12am or 1am|`|zXCFGPhOaa	9:00 pm on weekdays, you can pick on weekends.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	9 week days and 10 on the weekends|`|mTTPLly4aa	9 - 10 maybe they can earn an extra hour up if they don't fight you to get up for school in the morning but definitely no later than 10|`|pPc2kZfwaa	I'm twelve and i go to bed at 10. But it all depends on 2 things 1. how early does he/she get up? & 2.If it is early he/she could at getting up with out complaining. if  1 is early and  2 is true He/She should go to bed at 9 to 9:30 if  1 is early and  2 is not true He/She sounds ready to go to bed at 10. if  1 one is late and  2 is true He/she should go to bed at 9:30. If  1 is late and  2 is untrue He/she can go to bed at 10 just make sure he or she does get up.|`|DPegPYRPaa	My 11 year old Brother in law goes to bed 8:30-9pm|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	9.

Ofcourse, everything in the body works together, but this won't affect you producing sperm and getting a girl pregnant. I don't know how your stomach will handle digesting a condom though.

No, swallowing a condom will not mutate your semen and can in no way prevent you from impregnating a woman. It may, however, seriously affect your digestive tract so you may want to contact your doctor just in case. You really don't want to have an intestinal obstruction.     By the way, what is it that you do for a living that can't be revealed to your girlfriend?|`|5eneVfZ0aa	haha.. thts the funniest thing ive ever heard.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Ah man dude!

AA12127693	The ink wasn't dry on our license and we were told about two boys who moved in within a week or so.  We did reunification foster care and then when our son became available for adoption we proceeded with that.  That process took almost two years from the start of the TPR to the actual adoption.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	We adopted through foster care. We were approved in December 2007 and our child was placed with us in February 2008--2 months.|`|3OlUzzumaa	My parents adoped from Bulgaria and it took them about 18 months to do so. They adopted two children both 2 years old at the time but not siblings.|`|vwTyihvvaa	When I was born I was placed into foster care by my biological parents the same day. I was placed with a family within two weeks, (I was extremely ill and need a special home), then at one year my biological parents were given the option of being able to take me back being told my health was better but they declined and signed over their rights perminently. Around 15 months, my foster parents decided they would adopt me as I was deemed "not adoptable" due to my health.     My adoption was finalized and I was legally a family member at the age of two.|`|2wyDALHgaa	With our international adoption (done while we temporarily lived overseas so it was a bit different) we first applied and within the next  6 weeks we completed the process and had a placement as a permanent guardianship till we returned to Canada 2 years later.    For our second adoption, through domestic foster care, we applied in Sept 07 and were formally approved in Feb 08.  The day we got approved we were notified we were approved at 11 am and got a second call 3.5 hours later, at 2:30 pm, asking us if we would accept a placement of a 4 day old infant awaiting release from the hospital.  Her adoption was completed by 6 months of age.  So in answer to your question in regards to this particular adoption we waited 3.5 hours from approval to placement.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	We adopted overseas.  We received our referral about four months after everything was completed and travelled about six months after that.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	From the time we were approved until we got the phone call was about six months.  From phone call to baby was two weeks.  Domestic (US) private adoption.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	negative 18 months. he was in our home first. adoption approved at 18 months and final at 20 months.    We considered adoption because of our son..... We didn't consider our son because we were wanting to adopt.|`|2f49jsLpaa	We adopted both of our children from Korea, and were "matched" with each of them the day after we became certified to adopt. It's unusal for it to go that fast, but we were open to some "unknowns" and special needs, so the process went very quickly for us. After accepting the referrals it took 3 1/2 months for our oldest to arrive home and 5 months for our youngest.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	We received the first call from the agency about having our profile shown to an expectant woman the same week we were approved.    The baby was born a few weeks later.  She stayed at home with her natural mother for two weeks, then at the nursery in the agency for three weeks, then she joined our family.    So the time from approval to placement was two months.    Our case isn't typical though.  Our daughter is bi-racial and was drug exposed and there weren't many approved couples who were interested.  (Still shaking my head over that bit of fear and discrimination.)    PS  She's 10 now and she's happy, feisty, healthy, and a handful!|`|RTTgiNn1aa	We are approved to adopt and wanting a child of any race, etc. and have been waiting since May.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	We had a match during our approval process in our current province. The entire process was four months.  We adopted three children from foster care.    We were in a different province before that and waited five years, for the same kind of family.    Was it worth the wait?  Absolutely....I cannot say the Creator meant for me to be their mom, but I know we were meant to parent them after their parents became unable.  Our fates came together, out of loss, but together nonetheless.    I always said right child right place, and put life in the Creator's hand.  We also had to be willing to accept we might now become parents.  I would rather not have become a parent than to have adopted a child whose parent could have parented them.  I ended up adopting children who were in definite need of parents.|`|jq1moo5Waa	still waiting|`|Py1oiwYQaa	We did a domestic newborn adoption in the US.

QCUPeW8aaa	I also had my belly button pierced for a good 5 years and when I reached about 24 weeks my belly button got red irratated and hurt to touch.  I asked my piercer and they said I could try the pregnancy one but it would only stretch more and it wouldn't be worth the money.  They said to take it out and treat it with the ring out!  Its going to close up no matter what during your pregnancy at least let it close up comfortably!  Good luck!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Just take it out. You dont want to risk any infections, even ones that are on the skin. If it closes, its just what happens. Get it repierced after pregnancy if you wish to.|`|OwrGU6l1aa	I'm 21 weeks pregnant and at 15 weeks I swapped out my metal one for the pregnancy one, and it was irritated and pus coming out just like yours...I left it in but cleaned it with rubbing alcohol and used ointment every morning and night for about 4 days and it went right back to normal. I haven't had a problem since!!|`|hmZicrCYaa	Take it out and treat that would help a lot|`|Ttmbofqtaa	Take it out.|`|1Gy2rddmaa	Why don't you go to a doctor??! yeah you should of thought of that first  -__________-|`|GuH6LctIaa	Yes.    I had to take mine out...the pregnancy rings dont make a difference. The holes are still going to stretch.    You can repeirce it after if you want to...but your gonna have to have it out in the hospital anyways...so Id just go ahead and take it out now. theres really no reason to have one in right now anyways.    Its going to continue to stretch and get irritated untill you give birth.    Take it out clean it like your taking care of the peircing itself. Once you clean it... Then it can close and you dont have to worry about the "infection on the inside" anymore...because you cleaned it.    The only reason there would be an infection is because its stretching on the inside as well... a ring is not going to change that.    So ya...again id take it out and clean it. And not worry about it anymore till your baby gets here.      =)|`|26A1Q3eqaa	i would take it out if its irritated they say you should nto have any piercings that have not healed so i would assume that this situation would apply|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I took mine out and it never closed I was able to put my ring back in after the baby. I would take it out|`|bmoCpcdraa	yes your belly button will swell and pop out about an inch take it out leave it out or get infection|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	By keeping it open you are keeping it infected. Take it out and let it heal itself. The infection will be pushed out of your body, which doesn't like having foreign objects in it anyways.... You're only going to continue to grow and stretch in your stomach area, so that flexi ring will only do so much. Just take it out and let it heal the best it can and hopefully you can re-pierce it when you're back to you prebaby body:)|`|cJfJd9yaaa	You do need to take the piercing out.  The reason why it is infected is because the skin is stretching, making the hole a little bigger and allowing germs to get in.  I would suggest that you go to your doctor and get the infection cleaned.  He/she will most probably do it with an alcohol solution.  It doesn't hurt.  Don't leave it too long because you can end up with septicemia (blood poisoning)|`|hWc65sEtaa	I would take it out and use a triple antibiotic ointment on it.  It sounds like an infection is setting in with the pus and redness.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Treat it before it closes up. I would take it out.|`|yeFZzstvaa	Take it out.     Thank god you are one of the few pregnant people on Yahoo Answers who uses proper English. You will go far. Good luck with your child.    Peace.|`|YzCPY48qaa	best thing is to take it out.|`|fTvVEMVtaa	I would go to the pharmacy and ask if they have any type of treatment or an ointment for the piercing.  but u should most likely take it out.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	My sister had this when she had her son. I would just take it out and treat it like an open wound yes it will most likely close, when i had my babies i took it off toward the end and when i was ready to put it back in it was still a tiny bit open so i just stuck it in there. seriously anyways it is doing fine now, just take it our because it sounds like it is infected. Good Luck! plus you can always get it re done later on.

UUpsa35Daa	I can kind of go either way in this.    On one side, yes it is inappropriate considering they're both probably very hormonal and we all know how common sex or other sexual relations are among teens these days. Having them stay in the same house may be giving them a little too much rope. Teens can lie, they can be sneaky...anything's possible.    On the other side, under certain circumstances, i would allow it. If it was an absolute must and she had no where else to stay and you trusted both of them to keep it clean. I would talk to them both and lay down law. Give them them a list of possible consequences should they do anything inappropriate that pertains to their relationship and him separately.    Really...it all depends on if you feel comfortable with it and trust them enough to not do anything. It would depend on the 2 teens specifically whether or not i would allow it. Some teens aren't all that sex crazed. I'm 17, my boyfriend's 19...we've been together 2 years and lived together for a year before becoming sexually active. We just never felt the need to be in a rush with sex.    It just depends on the people involved.      Edit: He's only been dating her for 4 days? Then i definitely wouldn't allow it. That's a new relationship and they're in the "honeymoon" phase still. That can be dangerous.    It's not about not trusting him, it's about not trusting the situation. I wouldn't trust it either.     It may upset him, but he can rework his plans. Let him have her over until 11 or so but then she should be heading home. They can always meet up in the morning, no need for her to spend the night.|`|jdRKZe18aa	The absolutely ONLY way I would allow such a thing is if there was some DIRE NEED for her to stay there.  Otherwise absolutely NO WAY is that ok or appropriate.  I would CALL this girls MOTHER too and ask her how she feels about such an idea.... but either way it would NOT be ok with me.. AND if anything - I would let her stay in HIS ROOM and HIM on the cough where I could hear what was going on all night! |`|NQ2sDQMRaa	depends on how trustworthy your son is, would it be possible for her to sneak into his bedroom? I think the only reason it would be okay is if she couldnt stay at her house for some reason, but only if you trust him and her not to try anything sneaky in your house|`|r39EDGhPaa	I'm going to have to say no.    She will end up going into his room and it won't be all innocent.|`|lzivF4Idaa	thats what we told my exs parents we were doing when i was newly 16 (he was almost 18). we told them we would sleep separate after they found us in bed a bunch of mornings in a row.....so they agreed.     .....he got me pregnant at 18.     im gonna have to go with NO|`|Irm5gynTaa	what would be the difference in her sleeping on the couch, and sleeping at her house.  tell him she can stay as late as she wants, and come over as early as she wants the next morning (if that would be okay with you)  they have been dating for four days, why does she need to sleep over.  I'm 16 years old, and I LIVE with my boyfriend (he's 19) (2 1/2 year age difference) but, we have been dating two years, we both have full time jobs, I am graduated from highschool, and I am starting college in a few months, and he is going into the police academy in 3 weeks. I'm legally emancipated, and work for everything I have.  Tell your son, once he has good grades, i.e straight A's and a job where he can pay for everything on his own then she can sleep over.  ( i doubt he will get there, because the focus on homework and work is really hard, and he won't be able to save enough money at the same time. )  I pay rent, water, phone bill, electricity you name it.  and it is HARD, but it is worth it.   I also think it's more okay for me because, i'm mature for my age and wouldn't even have considered asking my mom to let my boyfriend sleep over on the couch even after we had been dating for way longer than four days, and my mom has always been my best friend. i just would have never asked her that. (untill I asked her If i could move out that is.)    and as for you not trusting him.  tell him you do trust him, you just do not trust his decision making skills of his choice to have his girlfriend sleep over that he has not even been dating for a week, and on valentines day. he's trying to be romantic with her obviously, so I would say definitely not. at four days, they definitely shouldn't be going there yet.  let him whine and pout whatever, tell him you'd rather hear him doing it than a baby in 9 months!      good luck & stay strong!|`|0LsRbK2iaa	well i dont' really know but i guess like if his girlfriends parents are ok with that and then you have to set some rules and stuff|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	The only way I would allow that is if she got kicked out of her house or something, but just because he want her to? No because she isnt gonna stay on the couch no matter what they tell you.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i don't like the idea.  Reason is simple, does the girl has a home to go back to??  Why she needs to sleep in some people's couch?|`|4uB0bbhnaa	I have 3 sons with the youngest being 18 now   so I've gone through all of this    To me, it depends on how long they have been a couple and how much you can trust them to stay apart all night,and is his g/f 16 or more    I'd warn them both, that's if you say yes, that if you catch them together then that will be the last of her 'ever' staying overnight    Why not talk to her mum as well,and find out if she is happy about it       if she says no, the that's it taken out of your hands altogether    its your house, so its your rules    I also told my sons, I wasn't ready to be a granny,  so they shouldn't be ready to be parents    Hope that helps ?|`|JOR9dSSuaa	you have to stand your ground!! what do the girls parents think of this? tell him that after he's seen her for more time because its only 4 days... talk to the girls parents for support...  good luck :]|`|PFO1jxZGaa	no. In my house the rule will be ( mine are too young to date) that your sigificant other can sleep over once you are married ( or living together in your own house) And it will be from the start. As for you not trusting him? well I guess he is right and I would tell him that too. I wouldnt trust a teenagers full of hormones either  Maybe if there was an emergency situation but not just because they want to and definately not after 4 days of dating. Come on.. even he cant know her that well yet so why should you allow a stranger in your house?|`|6RGnG1ukaa	Okay well that's weird he want to have her sleepover. Well not really that weird if your a 16 year old boy but...     In reality he doesn't just want her to sleepover and pull an overnighter,  he wants to get something from her. And by something I don't mean a box of chocolates.      If I where you I would lay down the law. Explain that it is your house and just because you don't want him and his girlfriend for 4   days to do something doesn't mean you don't trust him.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	on the couch is fine ,,,but tell him you are going to sleep in the living room as well if he can agree to that then fine|`|rG8Hxh4Gaa	i think you shouuld because if your son is trusting you with asking permission instead of sneaking her in, you should trust him and just give it a shot.. because later in the future he may just start doing things behind your back..but at the end its your choice! good luck!
bcZSIphUaa	Make sure that you have BOTH been to doctor to be checked out.    As a couple you are infertile and need help.

aPN7NsvXaa	My son stopped nursing to sleep around 10 months.  He would have his night nurse, but then want to just be put in his crib to sleep.  Obviously this isn't your answer, since you try to lay her down, but she screams.  I would suggest laying in bed with her...seeing if you can start getting her to relax first.      I, personally, am not a cry it out mother.  My children haven't ever had real problems going to sleep (we have to seriously change our routines and times every once in a while, but nothing long term).  I am an Attachment Parenting parent.  And, I suggest it to everyone.  AP makes for happy babies.  One book that has helped several of my friends, and been recommended by our home-visiting child advisor is No-Cry Sleep Solution.  I know I have recommended it on Y!A before and gotten thumbs up.  So, I hope you take it to heart when I advise reading it.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Have you tried lying down on the bed with her and cuddling her to sleep lying down...? Of course you don't have to [and absolutely should not] let her cry.     Lots of babies start nursing less late in the 1st year -- and then make up for it later. Useful: http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/babys... Just keep offering and don't stress it.|`|AA10526033	have you talked to your dr about this? my daughter had the same reaction when she was on milk based formula and had to be swtched to soy due to tummy pains plus not growing as she wasnt absorbing any dairy at all. maybe there is something not agreeing with her in your breastmilk
dpPqH7BAaa	If you got your period, you are most likely not pregnant. The reason for being early and it being irregular could be stress from trying to get pregnant. If it was really light bleeding it could be the implantation bleeding. The best thing you can do for your body is try not to think about it, relax and let whatever happens, happen.|`|IllWKAUGaa	I think it may just be in your head because you want it so bad, our minds can play serious tricks on us when we want to believe something. if you got a regular period then you are not pregnant...try again this month and keep your fingers crossed. don't stress because it makes it that much harder.    good luck and tons of baby dust.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well your irregular cycle is probably due to stress from wanting to be pregnant and since you had a period I would have to say not pregnant and yes your mind may be playing tricks on you.
