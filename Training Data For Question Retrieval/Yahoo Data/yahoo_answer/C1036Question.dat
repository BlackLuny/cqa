I'm not talking about all sports or there sponsorship deals I'm talking about sports like football, basketball and baseball where players can get like 30 or 40 mil a year! What happened to playing for the love of the game? Why can't they be happy with 1 million or under? There are neurosurgeons for example and many other far more important people getting NO WHERE near this. Whats your opinion on this?

20090308032947AAdImQc	Sports;Cricket	Lalit Modi is making a colossal mistake?	after the lahore attacks, the security for the IPL has become a big topic. i believe that lahore was a dress rehearsal for something big at the IPL. as was pointed out, when u can do a daring attack in broad daylight when streets are empty, what can be accomplished in the midst of the world's 2nd largest population? Indian security forces can't be made to clear the streets everytime a cricket team bus passes by. so the risks are infinitely larger in India than anywhere in pakistan. despite this, Lalit Modi, who is greedy scumbag millionaire, insists on IPL going ahead even though govt and security forces are unsure of it. he knows the risks at hand, but yet the fool doesn't budge.       I would like to warn Mr.Modi that if anything, and i mean anything, goes wrong at IPL on the security front, all Indians will be thirsting for his blood! he will be solely responsible, and will be subject to guillotine. any attack at IPL will mean end of international cricket in India, and IPL is gone for good. coming soon after Mumbai attack, India's reputation will die, and pakistan will laugh out loud. why can't he wait another yr and give already strained security forces some rest? of course, being a 200% pucca Indian, he sees only the color of money, not reputation or national security. as they say in pakistan, "a Hindu will sell even his own mother and sister for money"!

We were appalling in the field, apart from the 2 crucial run outs. We dropped the 2 nzl openers once each, we dropped mills when he skied a zaheer delivery, and we gave away runs thru sloppy ground work. Yet we won. Granted, the huge score allowed us to make some mistakes and get away with it, but still, we were poor in the second innings of the game. to give the opposition THAT many chances, and yet win, is champion material... Agreed?

20090308073252AAGEgpH	Sports;Basketball	Do you think this is totally unfair? (playoff matchings for youth basketball?)?	Ok so I'm in this travel league and today is the first round of the playoffs. My team is in division 3 and d3 has so many teams that they divided it into a north and south divisions. My team finish 10-2, and in second place. In the south (my division) there were two teams tied for first who went 11-1. one of those teams we beat, the other team we lost to. there was also a team in the north divison who went 11-1, but we beat them too. So you would think we'd have a good chance at winning the championship right? NOT. Since there were so many teams they combined the north and south divisions and then divided that into two divisions, one has all the good teams and one has all the bad teams. we are in the division with the good teams and they also brought down two teams from d2 who went 1-11. so now we are the SIXTH SEED OUT OF EIGHT TEAMS AND WE HAVE TO PLAY A DIVISION TWO TEAM TODAY IN THE VERY FIRST ROUND. Isn't that crazy? and teams we beat by a lot are in the lower division and they have a good chance atwinning the championship even though they don't even deserve it. Do you think this is totally unfair?

Weymouth didnt do too bad last week only losing 2-0 @ York compare to the week before losing 9-0 @ home to Rushden.         Weymouth will go down this season even if they dont finish in bottom 4 i say because they will fold, which will be a shame for them and the conference!

The seller is asking $200 not firm. It's a Ram-line Exactor in .22lr.      This is what I have written to send to the seller:   Thank you for the quick reply.    From what I see the scratches and marks on the exterior make it look about 85%. Ram-Line no longer manufactures pistols, so that means no replacement parts. This model looks like the 5.5 in. barrel, the first type made by ramline in the early 90's.   Considering the above facts I would like to pay $165.   Thank you for your time.      Ideally I would like to pay 165 but that may be a bit low. Hopefully we can haggle well. Please comment about revisions I should make with my offer or anything else that could help.

I achieved the milestone in his first Test match against India at Nagpur.  The Essex batsman is a product of the England under-19 system.I am a batsman who is mentally very strong and with the ability to convert fifties into big scores. The southpaw’s major scoring areas are through the cover-point region and he likes to work hard for each run. He is also a good close in fielder and has taken some amazing catches with his sharp reflexes at short leg or silly point. Though, a regular in the Test team, I is yet to nail his place in the ODI team. But looking at the talent and class he possesses.

20090227134559AAoGhS5	Sports;Cycling	Help with getting my first BMX?	I recently sold my old mountain bike (even though I could still ride it) because it was too heavy (sometimes I have to carry it over fences), had too many wires/random crap dangling off it, gears that kept screwing up and brakes that sort of just gripped the wheels until the bike stopped (after skidding several feet). It also looked kinda bad.      Anyway, I've opted for a BMX. What with it being simple and small.      I'm only going to be riding around town (pavement, street, grass) on it, not doing freestyle tricks or anything.       So I'd just like to know anything else that could be helpful with this. Also I'd like to know what size frame I should get: I'm 5ft 7inches tall.

You're in this new bass tournament out in the deep south, where bass grow huge. The water is far from clear, so there is no sight fishing. You enter the tournament thinking it's just any old tournament, and to find out, you can only take 5 lures with you. FIVE!!! What would they be? Here's what i would take. (NO SOFT PLASTICS, they are not allowed in the tournament, only hard-baits.)      1.) Cotton Cordell Super Spot. In some situations, i like it better than a Rat-L-Trap, and it has proved to be MORE productive than the Rat-L-Trap. Even though i think they are both great lures.      2.) Bill Lewis Rat-L-Trap. They will bring in bass in the muddiest of waters, around the world. I would stick to a bright color, such as firetiger, or chartreuse.      3.) 1/2 oz. Booyah Spinnerbait. The bass should be able to feel, and see the big spinnerbait. I would have a chartreuse/white skirted one.      4.) Strike King Pro Model 1/4 oz.

20090308075044AAz6fBc	Sports;Basketball	What is a good age for a basketball player to retire?	A lot of people are always ribbing Shaq about his age. I noticed this first started happening after the 2006-2007 season when he was 35. What I don't get is, a lot of players much older then the age Shaq is now kept playing basketball.      Dikembe Mutombo is 42, and still on the roster. Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar was 42 when he retired. Robert Parish was 43, Karl Malone was 41. Reggie Miller was 40, Michael Jordan was 40, Scottie Pippen was 39, Horace Grant was 39, and Dennis Rodman was 39.      The list goes on. Shaq is pushing 37, and I think he belongs in that list of great players, and still has a few more years left in him. So why the ribbing? And what do you think is a good age for a player to retire, and not get any jokes about being too old?
20090308081147AAImgNl	Sports;Baseball	Is it true that if a baseball player is hurt, the manager himself can replace him and put himself in the game?	No disrespect intended at all, but I've never followed baseball. It's a great game, I played T-ball when I was very young, I enjoy watching live games from time to time, I love the atmosphere of live games, and I really admire the passion the players and fans have for the game, I love reading old baseball stories, and I love movies about baseball too. But I myself never really got into the actual sport, so I don't know much about the game. However, I recall when I was a kid, hearing that the question in the topic box was true, and I was wondering if someone here could confirm it.      I also realize that if the rule is true, it is most likely never enforced, and a manager would most likely replace his hurt player with a younger guy in the dug-out, but I'm curious to know if it is an option or not for the manager to go into them game and play, and if it is......can someone please post a story of when this happened?

20090308063027AAOoUy6	Sports;Cricket	Who am I???  (Level : Hard)?	My team has found the most exciting fast bowling prospect in me.  The Queenslander is tall, fit and most importantly, a talented left-armer. Encouraging comments like "a once in a generation bowler" from my team great Dennis Lillee shows the potential this young gun represents. The youngster made an impact on international cricket in an ODI at Malaysia where he ran through the Indian batting line-up. He followed it with a series of good performances against India and Sri Lanka in his debut Test series. The quickie has the potential to clock deliveries around the 140-150 kph mark and has the great ability to swing the ball both ways. He is a good bowler in the death overs and has the knack of striking blows at crucial junctures. I  have an active role to play in the new my team pace generation. If the talented seamer keeps on improving my performances, he is sure to take my team to greater heights in the near future.      If you like my question please give me a STAR(Thank you!)

20090308064535AAGiNnk	Sports;Cycling	Why don't BMX street/dirt bikes utilize some mountain bike parts?	For many years now, a lot of BMXers have demanded lighter bikes.   For example, a way to make BMX street/dirt bikes lighter would be to use MTB bottom brackets, cranks, aluminum seat posts.  These parts are still strong but also lighter than bmx parts, especially mtb BB's and cranks.      If BMX bikes used some of these parts, it would be easier to go to a shop and get parts if more parts utilized mtb parts.      Why aren't manufacturers doing this?

20090308075810AA6pzi9	Sports;Running	I can swim and never get tired, but absolutely can't jog/run, why?	I can swim for hours, without feeling tired. Relaxed swimming or average speed, no extremes. I never had any problems swimming, also if i was not doing it regularly so it was not a result of anything special that i can swim.      Opposite, all sports that require running: sprints, long distance, football etc... In 10 minutes i can't even walk, loose my breath, feel pain everywhere. It's just the way it always was. Tried to improve it by jogging regularly for one year. No improvement just lots of pain and frustration to remember.      Any ideas why such extreme difference? What specialist can examine me to determine the problem and help to solve it?
