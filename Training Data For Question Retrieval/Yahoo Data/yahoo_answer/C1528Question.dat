I'm on my second year of a 7 year cover-to-cover Bible study, in Joshua, and one of the "requirments" I have for myself is a certain number of "supplementary studies" for each book, like just creative stuff (commentaries, audio sermons, movies, quizzes, etc). Does anyone have any ideas or resources for good information on the book of Joshua, or specific portions of it? I have already gotten all of the basic surface-text down, so most sources are just stuff I already know, I'm looking for ideas or sources that get into the deeper elements, like typology, sybolism, application, stuff not evident in english translations, etc. Or even if you just know something interesting about the book that isn't common knowledge, or a good "lead".         Thanks!  :-D

I am getting a duck enclosure built for my Muscovy ducks by a man that was recommend to me by a friend. He is the friend's friend, and has even invited us out for dinner with him, so he is sort of a new friend for us. But, he is taking too long to build the enclosure, he has been once every Sunday for the past 3 weeks for two hours each time and I haven't seen alot of progress at all.    I'm not happy with how long he is taking, as it's not a big job and at this rate it will take him until the end of the year to finish!   How can I politely tell him to be quicker, or come more often without offending him and my friend who recommened him to me.   I'm just about fed up of waiting and one of my ducklings is just about fully grown and has to live out by the back door! It's getting pretty desperate!

20090309180129AANIBN3	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	A question for homosexual men?	I hope you don't mind me asking but here it goes...      I am a happily married woman but I still have the need for friendship (as does everyone). I find other women hard to get along with, primarily due to hormones and crazy-***** mood swings and although I am more confortable with having male friends I think if I had straight male friends my husband may feel intimidated! For these reasons I feel more comfortable around gay guys!!! Then again I can't find any!!! lol      So to the point now - If I am looking for a gay (male) friend I would be worried about offending him! So (to gay guys) are you guys offended if a friendship starts on the basis that you are gay (and therefore I feel more comfortable around you)???

One year after being married for a while, I got a $9,000 loan and took my family on a 1 month vacation where we went to Orlando, then to Marineland, then to Daytona Beach, then to St. Augustine. We stayed in all the nice hotels, ate in all the nice restaurants, and saw attraction after attraction.      After two weeks, we missed the "routine" of home, work, family and friends so badly; the last two weeks of our vacation was a daily "chore", anything but a vacation. But we pre-paid everything so we had to 'use it, or loose it.'      Now we take 1-3 day mini-vacations and we are always happy to leave, happy to come back home.      Yea, we like routine.

So since evil came before beings, is that any reason beings need to   participate in evil?   Jesus and other angels have not done so.      Isa.45:7  I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.       So beause evil exist, does that make God evil or is he contending   with those that as Gen.8:21, says, those from youth, that never   learn how to overcome evil and allow being just to rule their lives.

20090309183322AABKJCh	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do horror movies always depict terrified females, and not males?	It seems that whenever we depict an emotional reaction to an event, whether in stories, on the screen, in a book, or a play, it is always a woman/girl who is doing it, and this especially includes horror movies. Why? The intellectual, and spiritual movies usually always involve male characters, almost to the point of excluding females. If they are in the movie, they are usually a supporting actress. Why? Is it because the film industry is extremely male oriented; and males obviously (they may deny this till they're blue) have a sick and twisted desire to be entertained by females suffering? I say, this is obviously primal, and the most logical reasoning, albeit, I could have worded it in a kinder manner. Is there a better explanation?      If anyone would argue that my statement above about males is an unfair one, lets consider the act of sex itself.  If we think in terms of evolution, or even take evolution out of the equation, the very nature of the act involves a man physically taking over a woman; and lets not forget the sounds she typically makes during orgasm, which are almost indistinguishable from the sounds of suffering.  If we took into consideration the primal aspects and hard-wiring of the mind, it makes sense to say that a man gets off on a woman's screams.  This may not be his fault, and it may be due to evolutionary development, but it doesn't make it any less animalistic and sick by today's standards and values does it?

(like the majority of the human race)    ok it is a little off beat to what my question is. but the fact of the matter is due to lust and jesus's word. you cannot be punished for being homosexual.      and those preachers that judge. who claim they are religious. forgot one simple thing. fo not judge unless you want to be judged (by jesus christ, and our god)      i'am religious and i have spoken to many religious groups and preachers. (some even scientists) and have never wittnessed anything in the bible that states homosexuality is wrong. and people who do judge use the bible as an exuse and twist words to attack at there own insecurities and hate.

20090309190650AAVTrfQ	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	What do you think about 2012?	I know that the planet Nibiru, or planet x is named after a babylonian reptilian god. i looked up some videos on youtube and they all look pretty convincing. i saw one about the great seal on the american dollar. they say that the president that put it up there was a decedent from roman or European royalty, and if your roman, some of your ancestors may have came from egypt when alexander the great seduced cleopatra. And some egyptians came from the middle  east like the bible says and if you come from the middle east, your most likely to have come from somewhere in Jerusalem or Babylon.    Big question is: What connections does the All seeing eye on the great seal have with the babylonian gods?

20090309190136AA85mgM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should we impose our beliefs on others?	I asked the question: how do you feel about abortion? and one of the responses was:      "It's alright with me. Who am I to say what someone can and cannot do? And who are other people to say others can't do something because it's against their personal beliefs?"      playing the devil's advocate, I responded:       "That said, I think one could make the argument that Casey Anthony should be punished because it's her life, and it has nothing to do with us."      What do you think? Obviously many people feel that there is a difference between these two situations, but can you really make the statement "Who are other people to say others can't do something because it's against their personal beliefs". Where do we draw the line when it comes to saying that others can't do something that we don't believe in?

20090309185720AARdKGu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this true -- "Sin lies in hurting other people unnecessarily: all other 'sins' are invented nonsense"?	Christians CLAIM that sin is "disobedience to God", yet they ALL disobey God ALL the time.  God passed down all manner of instruction, such as dietary laws.  God also commanded that we keep the sabbath holy.  God told us to: stone adulterous wives or promiscuous girls to death; beat disobedient children; take revenge on murderers; kill people who are guilty of beastiality; kill witches; and burn the daughters of priests at the stake if they're promiscuous!      Here's some relevant verses:   ????Genesis 9:6,????Exodus 21:12,????Exodus 22:18,????Exodus 22:20,????Exodus 31:14,????Exodus 35:2,????Leviticus 20:2,????Leviticus 21:9,????Leviticus 24:14,????Deuternomy 13:10,????Deuternomy 17:5,????Deuteronomy 22:20-21,????Deuteronomy 22:22,????Deuteronomy 22:23-24,????Deuteronomy 22:25,????I Kings 21:10.      Even the New Testament introduces us to hell and, in Matthew 15:4, tell us: "Whoever curses father or mother must certainly be put to death".      And of course God's injunctions for wholesale slaughter in battle and in the siege of cities are too numerous to quote.      So, if God tells us to do these things and we don't, or won't, do them, we are disobeying God.  You can't have it both ways.  If sin is disobedience to God, then that is what it is.      The definition of sin, posed in my question, above, is really much more moral, ethical, enforceable, effective and realistic.      So what say you?  The hypocrisy of biblical sin or the sin based on harm to others?
20090309185724AAMpZzO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Creationists, have you ever thought about this?	Isn't it more likely that our universe arose, or possibly just existed, by random chance, considering it is finite and seemingly began with no organization what so ever, than for an infinitely complex, perfect, and well functioning something, with the seemingly superfluous goal to create a universe with naturally organizing laws, to arise, or just have existed?      Isn't the logic behind this contradictory? You always say that complex things must have been designed because they are to complex not to be, but by that logic, anything with, not just the ability, but the goal in mind, to do something such as, manufacture a bacterial flagellum, code the alleles for DNA, or manipulate the Higg's constant, must be just as, if not more complex than the things it creates, so there for, the excuse of ignorance can't be filled by intelligence until intelligence is explained.

20090309190020AAUEfLK	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Was my grandmother's dead sister real or another entity?	My grandmother(1900-1997)told my mother that when she was 6 years old, her younger sister who was four died of tuberculosis.This happened in a time when Puerto Rico in the old days Catholicism and Spiritism were predominant and walked hand-in-hand. A lot of Puerto Ricans saw spirits of the dead in those days. My grandmother said that a month after her sister's death she began to appear every midnight to see grandmother when she was a six year old girl. My grandmother's foster parents wondered why they heard voices of conversation and at times they would go to grandmother's room and see grandmother but no one else. But in time they began to see grandmother sort of pale for lack of sleep until the morning when she could go to sleep. Grandmother said that one night her sister said if she would like to join her in a place better than this. Grandmother gladly said yes. In time she began to get sick. One night she asked,"Tell me what is heaven like? What does God look like? What does Jesus look like?" Her sister immediately vanished from her eyes. After that, she never saw her sister again just because she asked her that question. Now...was that girl her real sister or another entity impersonating her?

20090309184231AArlCA1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	(Christians) Do all things happen according to God's will?	Most people who believe in the christian God say that he is omniscient (all powerfull, perfect) and that all things happen according to his will.  The Christian God is said to unconditionally love all people - well if he is all powerful and loves us so much then why do people go to hell? If he is truly perfect then no one would go to hell.  This is because it is God's will for all to be saved, and God's will must be done because he is perfect.  If this hypothetical God exists, then he would be sending people to hell according to his will because he is perfect and everything happens according to his will.  God would create perfect people because it is in his nature to create such things.  Could an all-powerful God make a mistake?      All feed back is appreciated, thank you!

20090309185059AA4WRQt	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Are atheist and gay people signs of human evolution? Are we dawning on a new age?	I've been researching different religions, and it has lead me to study evolution. I was reading today that 500,000 years ago, much of the brain's expansion took place in the neocortex. And the neocortex is responsible for self consciousness, language and emotion. Which makes up 80% of our brain (as opposed to chimpanzees which only makes up 50%.) That tells me we are capable of "thinking up religious ideas, and explaining phenomena". And because we are a species that gathers in groups, first tribes, and eventually empires. Their was a need for large amounts of unlike people to be controlled by ideas of supernatural law. I'm wondering how this will develope because religion is a part of our genes and when people are born without this "gene" or they "logically refuse it" will people come together and except these differences? Will religion die as we know it? How will people being gay/bisexual change our popultion? And is this dying of faith a reason that the economy is not doing well? I feel like things are about to change, but it doesn't have to be for the worst. Change is good :) Well, I'm just looking for your thoughts. I certainly don't wish to sway anyones mind that does not wish it.

And well there this really cute football guy who i think is closeted and likes me.      Although, i cant tell if it's just me or if hes really checkin me out.  Heres a few examples: when were in the weight room, EVERY time i look over at him hes starin at me or in my direction.       when im lifting he comes over and does something near me even though all of his friends are completely on the other side of the room!      I see him between all of my classes, and i never used to before.      hes made friends with my friend robby who said that they started talking after zack (football dude) asked him if he was "friends with that gay guy" which is odd considering ive never talked to the guy      and i smirked at him when i caught him staring at me in the weight room and his face turned beat red         but then again, when in hear him talking with his friends hes always talkin about girls, and hes had a lot of girlfriends.... so yeah      please tell me that its not all in my head.  seriously this guy is GORGEOUS!

Someone answered that a year was more like 28 days "back then"; someone else said it was 40 days.  If that's true, when did that start?  I mean, when did they believe a year was 28 days or 40 days?  How long ago?  And if that's true, then how can anyone know the age of the earth in biblical terms when they didn't know a year was 365 days?  Also, someone said that they were created perfect so they lived longer.  How many people did God create perfectly?  Was it just Adam and Eve or were there other humans God created directly like Adam and Eve?  How many were there and who were they?  Were the children of these perfect beings also perfect?

This post is a continuation of a post that I made several months ago...   briefly,    I met a guy that I fell in love with, but wanted to wait to have sex until we were married. He would not wait-- raped me then promised to marry me...never did it...and I never called the cops...      The majority of those that replied told me that I should forget about him, so I have ended the relationship...      He is now sending me texts asking me to forgive him... says that he is sorry...      I still love him, is it possible that he really is sorry? Should I give him a second chance or continue to ignore him...      He is still registered on his online dating sites...   and I have noticed one women who replies to his page often...      and I do not know if he has been going to church regularly...

20090309192918AAveYEk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So what does this make me?	So I'm wondering if I'm agnostic or what?      For starters, I don't believe in a god, goddess, or any combination of the two.   I do believe that there is something else out there that we do not know of yet. Whatever it is, is probably scientifically explainable   I don't believe in creationism.    I do celebrate holidays like Xmas, but in a secular way. Just the candy/presents/tree. No jesus.   No such thing as heaven  or hell. Reincarnation - possibly maybe.       Yeah, I recently realized how many people actually do believe in a god/gods/goddess/godessess and the whole creation fairy-tale. I was raised this way, and like it. I just had to learn how to avoid disscussions about religion with the wrong groups.      Just say what you think this catagorizes me as, and I will not appricate anyone trying to peddle me a made-up fairy tale.
20090309204429AARdYEe	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What have you learned about different people and their culture?	Although Jamaica ( the Carribean Island)  isn’t where I was born, It was where I grew up as a child. I lived there for 17 straight years before coming to the United States. I am now living in the United States for approximately 8 years.       In Jamaica, parents aren’t all that concerned about their kids getting the best possible education available to them. They are more concerned about taking a rough life easy.       They trash talk anyone without worrying about whether what they say might offend other people. I mean, if one person is offended, that would be his problem, and he is often suggested to get a life and stop worrying about the small things.       Kids ages 4 and up walk the streets day and night without adult protection, and they don’t have that many people who go around hunting for kids to rape. Sure it happens, but not very often.       When I came to the United States, I was warned by a police officer for peeing on the side of the road, something everybody does in Jamaica freely. I got a lady offended by grinning at what she was saying, and she never once talked back to me. My neighbor thought I was crazy for wanting to borrow her frying pot. I got fined for leaving my dog’s poo on the ground at the park. And I got offended when my neighbors would walk by without saying hi. And not only that, I got approached by a guy for correcting his child’s behavior.       When I counted the times I got in trouble in this country, I knew I was the problem, and soon I would need to adjust.    If you are a frequent traveler, or you moved from a country to another to live, what have you learned from such experience? And what did you do to adjust to their lifestyle?

20090309201545AAKDxQn	Society & Culture;Etiquette	My 1800's era apartment has ceiling leaks and I am tired of it. Help!?	I have lived in my current apartment for almost two years. It is a old building from the late 1800's. About 7 months ago the kitchen ceiling in my apartment had a leak from a pipe in a corner. My lousy building manager didn't even believe me when I told him about the leak. When the plumber came to fix it the wet logged ceiling tile came tumbling down along with leaving a gaping hole in the corner of the ceiling. You could literally see upstairs into the next apartment. The plumber replaced the pipe with some cheap looking rubber hose which threads through the ceiling. The cheap rotted wooden slats also fell down and the wood has a huge hole in it. The landlord just replaced the drop ceiling tile, but did not plaster up the hole underneath it. When you come into my kitchen you can't tell how bad the ceiling is because of the drop ceiling hiding all the damage. Now it is months later and I have a kitchen ceiling leak again. Except in a different corner. Directly beneath my upstairs neighbors bathroom. I don't know if it is them dripping out of the shower on the floor again or another pipe leak. For several months the pipes have been making a drumming noise every time someone upstairs would turn on the water. These pipes look to be made of rubber tubing, not the pipes you would see in the bathroom. The cheap looking pipes actually thread through my ceiling upstairs and are exposed when you remove the drop ceiling tile. In addition, my living room and bedroom have cracks in the wall and ceiling, which are probably from the foundation settling. This building was built as a business establishment, not made to be apartments. This building can't handling all this activity. It needs to be professionally renovated and restored. The landlord just put a bandaid on it and made it look good from the outside. I hate this apartment. I don't want to go through this again with having another leak. It left huge ugly water stains on my ceiling and I had to beg the landlord to replace the tile. The landlord supposedly spent $20,000 on renovations. He just basically put in new cabinets and a new refrigerator, he surely didn't update the ceiling,walls,bathroom. My bathroom doesn't even have a electrical outlet in it. I don't know what to do? My lease is up in a few months. but I don't have money for a security deposit to move. Do prospective landlords allow tenants to move in without a deposit? I have to get out of the hell pit. Please help!

20090309201013AAdKKGf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Yet another essay question...? (sorry about that but I'm going to use all my resources)?	It's come to that wonderful time of junior year where I get to write a nice 10+ page research paper. I've narrowed my topics down and must choose between two: sex education and gay rights. Obviously I feel more passionately about the gay rights issue because most (if not all) of my friends are gay, and I'm probably the only conservative in favor of gay rights. There is one problem though. I'm fairly certain that "gay rights" is too broad, and would lead to more rants than research. I considered doing a paper on the Axios but realized that there is not enough information for an entire paper.      Do you guys have any ideas for me? What are some other groups that I could use as a starting point? I'd like to thank you in advance for any suggestions. I'm sure they they will help me to think of things that I otherwise would have never even considered.

20090309203346AAeZVTp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why am I afraid of going to hell? All people welcome?	Hi. I consider myself a Christian. Not perfect of course. I know everyone falls short of the glory of God. I have had premarital sex and I have repented. I repent for everything I've done wrong. I have accepted Jesus as my savior but that alone CANNOT save me from going to heaven so I don't want to hear that. I pray often, for myself and for others. I don't really curse or talk about people. I try to be thankful for what I have. I try to read my Bible when I'm not doing homework (college sophomore). I usually don't go to church being that I have homework all the time and do it all week and I cant go home to go to church with my parents. I'm just so afraid. I feel like i have to live a completely boring life and just wait to die. It's all depressing really. I really love my fiance but I can't make love to him anymore. It's so stressing and I'm so scared i spend hours at a time thinking about how I can get into heaven. How is it possible. It seems so unfathomable to get into heaven. If God loves all people, why is there even a hell to begin with. I just can't live with the thought of burning forever. I'm really afraid to die because in my heart even though I'm a good person and i do the right thing, i think i am going to burn. Why am I so afraid? I'm just so stressed with my fiance being a Marine, being a university student, and worrying about my safety I think I may lose my mind. Thanks. No criticism or mean comments please. Just answers.

I'm so confused, can anyone give me some pointers on how to ask him? I know there's no real easy way to ask someone if they're gay/les/bi whatever but I like to know everything about my close friends and it bugs me that he just left me halfway there.

Numbers 23:19    God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent.       1 Samuel 15:29    The Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent.       2 Samuel 7:28    Thou art that God, and thy words be true.       Titus 1:2    In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.       Hebrews 6:18    It was impossible for God to lie.       On the one hand god cannot lie, but then:      1 Kings 22:23    Now, therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.       2 Chronicles 18:22    Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets.       Ezekiel 14:9    And if a prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet.       2 Thessalonians 2:11    For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.

20090309202515AAEyYZ3	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How should I go about doing this?	My cousin died recently and her funeral is coming up soon. We had been raised like sisters since we were little. I still can't accept that she's dead. I mean I can say that she's dead, but I can't comprehend it if that makes sense. I would like to take a photo or two of her at the funeral to help me slowly accept it. (I know some people might find this creepy, but please just bear with me here.) I just don't want to go straight up to the coffin and start snapping away. So how should I go about it? Thank you.

Antes que nada, estemos solteros o casados, seamos jóvenes o adultos, siempre estamos prestos para buscar en el sexo apuesto algo agradable.

Antes que nada: contra lo que se piensa, el catolicismo es bastante light y tolerante, aunque lo duden, tanto que creo que los católicos somos el único grupo cristiano que nos atrevemos a inventar, contar y disfrutar de ciertos chistes, como este:      Un día el se?or le dijo a sus discípulos:      "En verdad os digo que yé es igual a dos equis al cuadrado más tres equis menos 2....."      Perplejos, los apóstoles se miraron unos a otros, confundidos. Entonces, después del asombro, unos minutos depués Santiago dijo:      "Perdón, maestro, pero es que no te entendemos". A lo Jesús respondió:      "No se preocupen, es solo una parábola."      .................. (Jua, jua, jua. Una parábola)...............

El Apocalipsis, por lo tanto, no contiene ninguna clave secreta que deba conocerse para ser interpretado. su decodificador (mente) distorcionaba mucho las cosas. Además, ponía cosas de sí que no le eran dictadas. En segundo lugar, las creencias de Juan se fueron agravando enormemente hasta el delirio.

I am a doctor and although I am not a psychiatrist, I see all the features of narcissistic personality disorder in him. He is very aggressive and arrogant. He constantly needs admiration from others which he gets by chatting online with other guys who constantly tell him that he looks good. This was acceptable before, but last month, he accused me of not giving him enough attention. He said he felt abandoned and met secretly with a guy he met online. I found out by accident, and he was sorry. But since then, he has been going out with other guys openly (nothing sexual happens, I believe him). I know he just needs them to feel good, and that he loves me, but whenever I think of him going out with another guy, I go crazy. He then tells me that I'm the one who's crazy. I know that he is just sick and I love him so much but what he does makes me go crazy. I know I love him because otherwise I would have left a long time ago. What do i do?

20070602182546AAjwp67	Society & Culture;Languages	Can you please translate this into Spanish (El Fin! Thanks!!!)?	The jury didn't buy it. They found Tom Bonney guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death, but this sentence was overturned in 1992 due to evidence from another psychiatrist that Bonney had been incompetent to even stand trial. Today the case remains in limbo, and Bonney has stated he never told anyone he had more than one personality.   Kathy's friends believe Bonney argued with his daughter over a sexually-explicit letter from a boyfriend, and then shot her in a jealous rage and dumped her body in the canal.   MPD/DID remains a controversial issue in court, but it has entered the legal arena in another way as well, in what most ridicule as a simple-minded and even outrageous judgment.
20070602183117AA70LX1	Society & Culture;Languages	Can you translate this into Spanish please? (This is out of context so it might not make sense)?	Dell had not witnessed Bonney taking many of the written tests used to form his diagnosis; he had formed an a priori opinion of Bonney's mental state prior to meeting him, admitting his bias; there were many significant discrepancies and inconsistencies in Dell's report for the court; he clearly had been leading his subject with suggestion; and, finally, the use of hypnosis held no credibility in supporting Dell's diagnosis. Outside a trance, no alters were observed. The prosecution also pointed out that Dell had often discussed the case and his theories with the press, which suggested an ulterior motive to his involvement. In addition, Dr. Phil Coons, a prominent psychiatrist who had been instrumental in writing the diagnosis of MPD for the APA's manual of mental disorders and an expert on it, further discredited Dell's methods and diagnosis.

20080503223959AAowY7t	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do most people think they have superior knowledge of the truth?	I've noticed that when it comes to spirituality, most people find no gray area. Either they are gung-ho in their religion and believe there is no truth outside of it, or else they are complete athiests who try to convince everyone else that they are fools for their belief in God. I've been on one side of that fence, I once was a hardcore Christian. But I never lied to myself. When I read things in the Bible that seemed contradictory or thought about things in Christianity that seemed  contrary to the nature of a loving God, I questioned and thought about them, deeply. That experience led to me being a spiritual person instead of a religious person. I rpray and meditate, and read and find inspiration in many spiritual texts, including the Bible. Christians would say I'm going to hell, and athiests would say I'm a fool. Why the extremes? Or maybe this question is stupid because it just proves that I, to believe in the superiority of my own beliefs! Ha!

20081015131740AAMJIz8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	2 religions. 1 baby. ?	I was raised Christian. My mom is a religious extemist and sent me to some pretty crazy christian schools. have decided I don't believe in any organized religion. My husband is Sikh. He's proud but of it, but is not extremely involved. He'll go to the temple on occasion.       Our daughter is 1. She's been to church once and been to the temple once. It hasn't been much of an issue, yet. I'm scared it will be though.       Even though I'm not following a religion, I still want my daughter to be raised knowing my points of view (that there is a god, that the best place to find him is in nature, not church, to be respectful of others religions, but know that no one has it figured out, and no one is 100% right, etc.)      I'm scared since I'm not big into church that his religion is going to dominate. I don't mind if she learns about it and is respectful and visits temple, but I don't want it to become a weekly thing. Is that selfish of me? How would you proceed?

What does it mean when you and your father figure (my pastor) had a huge fight and he gives you the silent treatment forever.    1st and 2nd apology didn't work. I just got the silent treatment. That hurt so badly. It wasn't until I got into personal turmoil and he found out about it and then I left him alone for awhile and then came back and say I am truly sorry and he a great person.       Then he finally accepted my apology and thanked me for the email. he says: "You know, I really do want to see the very best happen in your life .. and I personally believe that Christ needs to be a part of that equation. Of course it takes a willingness to emrace Him in our life and do our best to follow what He asks of us.      THen he says: "Warmest Regards..."         Give me your honest opinion on what all this means ok?

This should probably be taped       to your bathroom mirror       where one could read it every day.       You may not realize it,       but it's 100% true              1. There are at least two people in this world       that you would die for.              2. At least 15 people in this world       love you in some way.              3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you       is because they want to       be just like you.              4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone,       even if they don't       like you.              5. Every night,       SOMEONE thinks about you       before they go to sleep.              6. You mean the world to someone.              7. You are special and unique.              8. Someone that you don't even know exists loves you.              9. When you make the biggest mistake ever,       something good comes from it.              10. When you think the world       has turned its back on you       take another look.              11. Always remember the compliments you received.       Forget about the rude remarks.                     So...........       If you are a loving friend,       send this to everyone,       including the one that sent it to you.       If you get it back, then they really do love you.              And always remember....       when life hands you Lemons,       ask for Tequila and Salt and call me over!              Good friends are like stars........       You don't always see them,       But you know they are always there.              "Whenever God Closes One Door He Always Opens Another, Even Though       Sometimes It's Hell in the Hallway"                     I would rather have one rose and a kind word       from a friend while I'm here       than a whole truck load when I'm gone.              Forward to all your friends.       And don't tell me you're too busy for this.       Don't you know the phrase       "stop and smell the flowers"?       See how many "bouquets" you end up with!              Happiness keeps You Sweet,       Trials keep You Strong,       Sorrows keep You Human,       Failures keeps You Humble,       Success keeps You Glowing,       But Only       God keeps You Going

20070730001026AA2U662	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How to come out transgender (ftm) to family?	I am a 30 yr old ftm and am on my way to surgery (top) and hormone (testosterone) within about 6-10 months from now. I have most things taken care of, minus the family's knowledge. I am also a single parent to one child. My mom has asked me in the past if I wanted to be treated like a man, but I had always told her no... That was before my daughter was born... So now I'm worried she'll pull the "you have a child" card... Any opinions on how to go about this? I'm thinking a letter? My mom lives w/in about 2 miles from me, so it's not that I couldn't just do this face to face... but I'm thinking she needs it to sink in. I am really worried about her rejection (as I'm sure most trans people are) but need this to come out, because I want her comfort and support while I have to go under surgery. I don't NEED it, but I'd like it. How do I do this? Even the thought of her knowing kills me, but on the other hand the thought of her knowing would feel so liberating.   Rudeness will b reported.

20081004083056AAkYDe2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	ATHEISTS, are you not AWARE that you were CREATED by a SUPREME BEING who made you in His IMAGE ?	I do not think a rock in outer space had an idea how to make a human   being in a certain way.  Look at the humna body,  it is proof that we   were created by something or Someone Divine.  It is just a wonder   of the world.  The way we talk,  the way we walk,  the way we live,   it says everything.  And the way we think speaks volumes.  I still   say that because of our ability to reason, and rationalize, it shows   that it is not possible that we came from nothing.  There is a nucleus   behind everything.  Even the universe itself.  So now do you understand   that there are things about ourselves,  that we cannot fathom or   explain ?  Even with all the so called scientific evidence itself............

20081031135305AAeD2nS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	A girl got written up because the teacher was prejudice. Does this seem fair?	She had, "Bisexual Pride" written on her pant leg from the knee down and wore them to school. The Science teacher gave her a write up because of that; which caused a controversy between her and the teacher, and then she argued back so she got ANOTHER write up! The teachers are always telling us to express ourselves and that we shouldn't be afraid to show who we are, but then when they found out, she got in trouble! I see "Asian Pride" on some people's binders and "School Pride" and other similar pride sayings on binders, papers, shirts, shoes, and sometimes on people's arms w/ sharpie, but if someone writes "Gay Pride" or "Bi Pride" we immediately get into trouble because we can't express ourselves. How should we handle the situation, how can we stop it from happening again, and how can we get the ignorant teacher in trouble and get her suspended? Any NICE and SUPPORTIVE comments or ideas are welcome. As for the gay bashers, go somewhere else, because this is NOT the place for ignorant remarks on how we're "going to hell" or "are impure" or "a disgrace to society and the human race."
