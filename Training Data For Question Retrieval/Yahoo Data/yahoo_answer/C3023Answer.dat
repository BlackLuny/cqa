R46rxxGyaa	Record job search for any and every week for which you claim benefits.  In GA it's much better to log more than 2. and not the same number of places or the same places each week.  They actually prefer more like 5 to 10 a week.   Checking back can be logged too and there are very few places that will deny you a job for a courteous call back or stop in.   <br>  <br>  You said you have a record but don't want top put it on their paper because they haven't paid you yet.  Think of it this way.  That search is the "work" you do to "earn" the unemployment pay.   If you have a job where you are paid every 2 weeks or once a month you still need to work the weeks in between when your paychecks come.   Writing the places down will take less than 1/2 hr so your pay rate for doing that bit of writing is $130 an hour.    <br>  <br>  BTW you may also be eligible for food stamps and some other things.  Check with DFACS on that.  If you live with friends or family or have a roommate the thing that makes the difference between having the income of everyone in the household;d figured together for stamps and having just your income figured for your stamps is whether or not you and others in the household buy prepare and eat food together or you buy prepare and eat the majority of your meals separately.   See which works best for you.|`|2ba4b971de34bd524a977d925989e880aa	For each week you claim, you need to log two job searches.<br>  Contact two places of Employment and see if their hiring or not...<br>  Just register the Place, Address and Phone Number...<br>  <br>  I do all of mine on line.. I just posted my Resume on the Unemployment Job Board (which was required in Ohio)...<br>  <br>  Every place I contact is not hiring...<br>  So I at least write down who I contacted...<br>  <br>  EACH WEEK YOU CLAIM... LOG TWO JOBS
RD1uEbGWaa	Contact your local Child Care Resource and Referral Agency.  They are paid by the state to help people find child care, so their services to the parents are free.  They should have a database with information on all of the local providers.  You can find your agency through:  www.naccrra.org<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  You might also want to go to our website to download a "Choosing Childcare Checklist":  <a href="http://www.kidcentric.com/support-for-parents" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidcentric.com/support-for-pa...</a>

fpGroPpzaa	New York Health & Racquet Club. I worked for them as a lifeguard and got to know some of the sales team & what they offer.Their contracts can be canceled at any time and does not require commitment.|`|AA11385539	I went to Curves years ago and didn't have a problem at all when it came time to cancel my membership.  Most places require written notice 30 days in advance, so just make sure you do what they want and are clear on the cancellation policy when you join.  Good luck!

7a7330eb2ff515adb55d25158415c54faa	Gene's Place is awesome. I just had to add to that. :D<br>  <br>  I think Stamper's in Fairview on Lorain Rd. may serve alcohol earlier. I can guarantee they do a kegs and eggs during St. Patrick's Day.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Gene's Place: Kamms Corners|`|4e846120a30e765fcdf27eaf5fa85b62aa	This site can help you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Packages-g50207-Vacation-Package-Discount-Cleveland_Ohio.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Packages-g502...</a>

DJMPQlFDaa	I have thought about selling it but I am a bit shy. And any ways there is a Avon store in Plano right off of Hwy 5 and Park I could go to if I wanted to buy anything.
BzFKTbYhaa	Chesterfield Town Center is the big "hang out" draw for the area.  It's a fairly large mall and I am sure that you are familiar with it.  <br>  <br>  There used to be a "Laser Quest" on Research Road that I used to hang out at.  It may be closed now, but we had a blast playing there "back in the day."  (Dang, I feel old now.)  <br>  <br>  The Commonwealth 20 Theaters are pretty decent.  Once you are inside, they sell food, have arcades, and plenty of places to sit.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|s7KbH3iOaa	if you're interested, you can do surveys online for extra money, I know a good site thats free to join and for age 13 and up <br>  check my blog for info and Proof of Payments<br>  <br>  <a href="http://surveyinfobase.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://surveyinfobase.blogspot.com/</a>

You can call the store to get it. Expect to be on the phone for quite a while... i don't have it and have used it once and it then was a mess in trying to get my store to give it to me.
lLN8VD20aa	I doubt if its anything of worth ... but why don't you give them a call:<br>  800.606.6969  or  212.444.6615
1P4RJgTQaa	Yes they are. When you see brand name crests or symbols like Fedex or UPS rest assureded we know our customers before we ship for them.
