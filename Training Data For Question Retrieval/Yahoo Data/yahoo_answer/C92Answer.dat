xxDjV6Axaa	You can't use a bill like this to compensate for flaws in human nature.  There is no compensation.  We must stop looking at this bill as something that will help us.  It won't.  <br>  <br>  To combat domestice strife, we must encourage personal responsibility, not blame and dependence.  While it is also human nature to want an easy way out and to want things given to us, that method will only cause even greater strife.<br>  <br>  For some unknown reason, the Democrats have ignored cause and effect with this bill.  The whole world runs on that one premise and they are ignoring it.  Great.|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	Any crime is a hate crime, especially if it us murder.

CbeNLpb3aa	No - but free market capitalism can only work in a moral society. And here's a hint - ours isn't.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	The word anarchy comes from the greek anarkhos meaning "without a ruler" it does not necessarily equal mayhem and deliberate problems.<br>  <br>  I do agree with your last statement that a free market will not operate uncorrupted by those in power. A free market would be the citizens deciding on their own what they wanted to buy and sell in trade- Many who moved west during the pioneer time did not start using money until the late 1800's because they simply traded in the community. Their largest problems were not getting cheated by the people they traded with, but simply being raided or robbed by transients passing through. Power is for tyrants who have no intention of helping people...people who help people go into philanthropy, not politics.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	What's your alternative?  To have the government take care of everybody?<br>  <br>  Without a free market, who will be paying into the government so that such a venture can take place?|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	yes a completely free market is called anarcho-capitalism. <br>  <br>  I doubt anarcho-capitalism would work. <br>  <br>  There should be rules of law that dont give anyone benefits over anyone else, and some social programs such as fire depts , roads, police, courts, etc. and maybe vouchers for education for the extremely poor.<br>  <br>  hahaha laissez-faire doesnt work? Let me guess you fell for your teachers Bs about how hoover was a laissez-faire advocate right? Man the kids nowadays are so uneducated. Hoover was a huge interventionist. You just fell for the propaganda kid. <br>  <br>  Hawkeye- you are an idiot if you think Ron Paul believes in Anarchy. He believes in RULE OF LAW! He believes in the constitution and STATES RIGHTS!  there is a huge difference. With Rule of law, you do something illegal, you get fined or go to jail.He doesnt think we should be getting rid of fraud laws or anything like that you idiot. He also supports vouchers to provide for education for children. He also supports the social programs I have listed above. What he doesnt believe is over regulation, and subsidization of companies that wouldnt be competitive without them. Dont talk about someones platform when you have no idea what you are talking about you clown.<br>  <br>  You have no idea what you are talking about. first of all the gap between the wealthy and poor  decreases with capitalism. second of all laissez-faire has never failed, that is just b.s. and you cant show me one single fact that proves otherwise. THIRD OF ALL , AND YOUR MOST STUPIDEST CLAIM IS RON PAUL BELIEVES IN THE "BUSINESS CYCLE". Ron Paul believes that the business cycle is caused by the federal reserve, he doesnt believe in such things as business cycles these are artificially created booms and busts. Go read about the austrian business cycle theory and then get back to me. I can tell your level of education is very minimal so stop talking about things you dont understand kid. <br>  <br>  EDIT: DID I SAY RON PAUL BELIEVES IN ANARCHO CAPITALISM? I SAID ANARCHO CAPITALISM WOULDNT WORK! MURRAY ROTHBARD WAS AN ANARCHO-CAPITALIST. LEARN HOW TO READ! I know Ron Paul is an advocate of the austrian school. I should know, I advocate the same.......<br>  <br>  And Anarcho-capitalists dont believe in barter. They believe in a commodity standard, usually gold or silver. I would know Ive read more about murray rothbard than youve read on economics. Yes Ron Paul doesnt believe in the welfare state. I dont either. What the hell is your point? So now we need welfare for the country to be successful right? Youre a clown. no point in talking to you anymore. You obviously dont know the first thing about economics.<br>  <br>  ROFL NO **** SHERLOCK. I just told you ron paul thinks that the business cycle is caused by the fed reserve,  good job parroting the information back to me. And You still couldnt answer why laissez-faire has failed. Obviously government always wants more power and what better way then to start intervening in the market. This doesnt change the fact that laissez-faire is the only good way to run a market.  And I know more about Andrew Jacksons run in with the central bank than you think. You dont need to tell me about it. Shut up you dont know what you are talking about. Everything in economics is based on supply and demand. Period. You make no sense with your natural laws theory. You are sounding more and more like an idiot with each new line.<br>  <br>  "He does not believe in REGULATION.... he believes in the "business cycle." <br>  And now you say he doesnt advocate it. SO tell me how the hell did you mix he doesnt believe in regulation, to he believes in the business cycle, and now you switch your words to he doesnt advocate the business cycle.  You dont make sense.  Your thoughts dont even make sense. What does not believing in regulation have to do with believing in a business cycle and not advocating it. DOnt even give me an excuse.. you obviously didnt know what the **** you were talking about and once I called you on your bluff you tried to change your words around.<br>  <br>  Rothbard was a genius. he was shunned upon by the academia because he was anti state and anti federal reserve. And HAYEK got a nobel prize for the austrian business cycle theory. It doesnt matter what you believe or not, it doesnt change the facts. The fed is not reactionary. If it lowers interest rates and changes reserve requirements, the economy is going to react. Not vice versa. You once again show you have very little understanding of econ. PLease stop making yourself look worse and worse.|`|I4e8Hn3zaa	I strongly disagree. <br>  The free market system is totally functional and the best system ever as long as you recognize the fact that businessmen must be responsible for their actions. <br>  It only goes wrong when participants act irresponsibly and are not held liable for their bad actions. But then, that is true of all the actions of every individual everywhere, not just businessmen. <br>  It is even more perfect because the incompetent are allowed to fail. That promotes more efficiency, better quality and greater value. It promotes ingenuity and creativity. It eliminates poor planing, poor quality, and inefficient or dangerous products, and promotes affluence.  <br>  It only gets messed up when government interferes with enforcement of responsibility, props up those who fail, or taxes success excessively to shift the fruits of their labors to those who are incompetent.|`|AA10177954	What are you proposing? fascism like we have now?

6e6fb50d87f07492879715e4526ac64daa	you are absolutely correct. <br>  <br>  if people don't have to worry about cost, they'll flood every doctor's office, hospital, clinic, and health care facility everytime their farts smell funny while people with serious illnesses will die waiting. <br>  <br>  but there's also something people never mention. in america, doctors are rewarded greatly for their services with high salaries. this attracts the most competent doctors from all over the world. <br>  <br>  if you were offered to make $400,000 a year to do the same job you're doing right now but it required you to relocate, would you do it?<br>  <br>  of course you would. that's why world leaders and wealthy people from other countries come to america when they need medical treatment. they know they're getting the best available. <br>  <br>  if you turn doctors into mere civil servants, that will stop and so will other young men and women who have the ambition to be doctors or health care workers.<br>  <br>  money inspires people. liberals will never figure that one out.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Why do Republicans ALWAYS try to use inane hypotheticals in a futile attempt to cause fear and dissent?

naJGDkFjaa	Wow -- I usually don't even bother to answer questions that are this foolish and racially motivated but I'll try to give you an objective -- non bias answer.<br>  <br>  I'm a 100% black (African born) teen living in the states, both of my parents are doctors -- they are not medical doctors but they are doctors in the sense that they both hold doctoral degrees -- Phds.<br>  <br>  My mother is a prominent clinical psychologist who has given numerous IQ reasoning tests to black children born into socio-economic dispositioned backgrounds. <br>  <br>  There is absolutely no correlation between race and intelligence because there is no absolute method of testing human intelligence. For instance, IQ tests that are administered in the U.S could not be used to test children in Kenya -- let alone children born in the inner cities of major American metropolitan because I.Q tests are based on cultural knowledge <br>  <br>  I would go into greater depth but I have to jet -- I have class that begins in 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  BTW -- When I was younger I was extremely hyper-active in grade, my Science teacher confronted my parents and told them that I had a learning disability --- My parents took me to a psychologists who in turn administered an IQ test -- needless to say, I scored in the 98th percentile on the IQ reasoning test. I'm definitely not trying to bolster my image when I make this referenced but I just want you to know that race and intelligence are not interchangeable. -- The majority of may family is in the top 2% on a global scale -- as far as intelligence is concerned and we are ALL Black.|`|AbzXA92laa	The Bell Curve book and subsequent studies are very interesting. <br>  <br>  In recent years the concept has been extrapolated to extend to inter-racial marriages and bi-racial off spring. <br>  <br>  The theory is that blacks (men and women) are more eager to inter-breed with whites, hispanics, and asians from a biological perspective because it gives their off spring a better chance of survival and success, thanks to a higher iq level.<br>  <br>  This has been born out within the black community who often embrace lighter skin-ed (and therefore most likely to have a mixed genetic pool) over darker skinned (considered lower down the social ladder).<br>  <br>  The danger however is that there is a difference between a group having a higher or lower iq mean (average) and them being successful or even smart. There will be those within the black community that have extremely high iq levels. <br>  <br>  There will also be those in the asian, hispanic and white populations that have lower iq levels. <br>  <br>  The study simply shows a variance in the genetic and biological make up and not in their ability to achieve.|`|k6hicodfaa	It also gives hypothesis as to why this is.

SkOALXv9aa	Well said my friend.  Once again we see throughout America people who continually follow their party instead of trying to get the proper people elected that will do the most good.<br>  <br>  Lets hope that one day our voters will realize what they are doing and just why we are in the critical situation we are in today.  Many of our voters today are democrats or republicans because their parents were.  Their parents were voters of another era of crisis and supported unions (which may have been good at the time) that have outlived their usefulness.  They like our government have grown to excessive levels and to a point of inefficiency and corruption.<br>  <br>  It is time for the people to demand cutbacks in the over sized government.  They need to get rid of committees that have outlived their worth.<br>  <br>  They need to get rid of departments that are only a drain on the taxpayers.  We should repeal the 16th amendment and make our government live within a budget like every American family must do.<br>  <br>  The 16th amendment gave congress power that should have never been given to them.  A flat tax would be far better.  If that were to take place they could fire every employee and shut down every office associated with the IRS as they would no longer be needed.  The rest of us who pay the freight on this over sized tax burden would not have to worry about filling out income tax each year by April 15th.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Firstly.......Obama has a wonderful education and as a lawyer learned to speak well.

NTBbZ7ITaa	politically incorrect:  anything that liberals don't want to hear|`|AA10783710	"In his book, The End of Sanity, Martin Gross writes that 'blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor. <br>  <br>  There seem to be new customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction. Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong. And they don't like it.' <br>  <br>  Before someone here claims to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did political correctness originate on America's campuses?  And why do you continue to tolerate it?  Why do you, who're supposed to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression? <br>  <br>  Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare you, too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason.<br>  <br>  The problem with America is we try to be too fair, and the result is chaos.<br>  <br>  The biggest societal mistake America commits is trying to make everything perfect. Every miniscule offense, whether real or imagined, has to be "corrected". Hence, people develop a bizarre sense of absolute entitlement.<br>  <br>  Filmmaker Michael Moore asks people throughout his movie on the Columbine massacre why America had so much violent crime, often involving guns. Here is the answer he has been looking for: the unrealistic sense of absolute entitlement driven into the minds of Americans.<br>  <br>  Only in America does one person have the "right" to be offended by something that neither concerns nor even affects him. In Florida, ONE Muslim complained about a nativity scene in a library, so everyone had to be deprived of seeing a beautiful, traditional Christmas display because of one silly, petulant whiner. In another case, a person complained about a nativity scene, even though they also had a Jewish Menorah and Muslim religious symbols on display for people to enjoy.<br>  <br>  People have gotten so crazy about their "inviolate rights" that when something relatively insignificant happens, they react by shooting someone.<br>  <br>  The ACLU does not understand one simple concept: a society cannot function when everyone has the right to disrupt absolutely anything they don't agree with. Imagine if you had a big dinner party at your home, and "Sally" complains about all the dishes containing meat, because she is a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  "Bill" objects to the gold-rimmed wine glasses because gold is sometimes mined by underpaid workers in third world countries.<br>  <br>  "Janice" complains that the dinner plates were manufactured by a non eco-friendly company, and demands that her host destroy all the offensive china immediately.<br>  <br>  "Ahmed" bitterly denouces his hostess because she is serving wine, which violates the precepts held dear in the Koran. Also, this infidel hostess should be covered from head to toe in a burka, because her exposed calves are an abomination to god.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Just like this dinner party could not even be held, a society cannot function when the legitimacy of absolutely everything is constantly challenged.<br>  <br>  Enough of this chaos.  Enough of this thinly-veiled censorship.  If I work with a person who is lazy, I'm going to call a spade a spade, and not worry that some politically correct Liberal will accuse me of sexism or racism if the person is not a white male.|`|bqJgdcfLaa	If it is voluntary it isn't an attack on freedom.

It seems we have moved euphemistically from Dracula to a corporately repackaged Blackula in the person of Barack Obama. In the very name of “change,” Obama is moving America euphorically backwards.<br>  And euphoria notwithstanding, those who ignore reality and the lessons of history, do so at their own peril.

Now the bills will come due. The pain may be just beginning.<br>  <br>  The problem is, if you talk down the economy you get a down economy, and stocks down, too. It's worse yet when your talk is not countered by credible action to ward off the threats you claim.<br>  <br>  The actual dollar cost of the legislation is trouble, too. Bills won't come due all at once, but new taxes and government debt that could hobble the economy for decades is looming. <br>  <br>  People look ahead at this and don't like what they see.

He is a mere man and at that a man that does not have a whole lot of experience in dealing with matters of this kind. Very few (if any) people in this country have had experience dealing with an economic crisis of this magnitude...so they are all flying blind more or less.

gau0w8LMaa	Katrina was bungled by local officials first and foremost, bungled by residents next, and by the federal government last. <br>  <br>  Local officials waited for federal money before they would act.<br>  <br>  Local residents were warned to leave well before the storm.<br>  <br>  FEMA pissed down their leg when crunch time came. <br>  <br>  As far as Iraq goes, Bush muffed the thing along with Rumsfeld.<br>  <br>  They made things better with Gates and Petreus.<br>  <br>  The media in both cases showed only the worst case scenarios. There were a lot of good things going on in Iraq but only FOX showed them.

Survival of the fittest.   :)|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Probably...but if prostitution was made legal nation wide and that taxed...they would make even more.

However, if the tax was too high, I wonder if we would just see a lot of drug trade continue underground.  They already are running a black market.  It would just go from violating anti-drug laws to violating tax laws.<br>  <br>  I think that the real money would be in law enforcement savings.  I don't know how much of the drug war expenses are on fighting marijuana versus stronger drugs.  I have heard some pretty high numbers of incarcerations due to marijuana possession though.  So there are clearly savings to be had.  They would only be diminished if significant tax avoidance occurred *and* government tried to fight the tax dodgers.<br>  <br>  Notably, even with tax revenues remaining at zero net income would still improve if government stopped enforcing anti-marijuana laws.|`|5mCm2XTLaa	There's a plan in the works to legalize marijuana for recreational use in California. If it passes they estimate it'll generate 1.2 BILLION dollars in tax revenue every year. <br>  <br>  Why not set up a system to tax and regulate cannabis just like they do with alcohol?After all it's not like the war on cannabis has had much effect except for putting mostly nonviolent dopers in jail and making violent drug runners rich.<br>  <br>  EDIT: By the way before the federal ban marijuana was outlawed just before the start of the depression in the southwestern states to make it easier to deport Mexican migrant farm laborers during lean economic times when this "surplus" population wasn't needed. Common sediment back then was marijuana made people violent. One California citrus grower put it as "all Mexicans are crazy...and it's the marijuana that makes them crazy". <br>  <br>  Marijuana was finally outlawed at the federal level back in 1937, again because of political pressure this time from the paper and cotton industries because they wanted to eliminate competition from hemp. <br>  <br>  Of course before outlawing pot was possible the American public would have to be convinced that "marijuana is the worst drug in the history of mankind". Thanks to people like Harry J. Anslinger and William Randolph Hurst a lot of folks still have the same mindset. After all remember "reefer leads to pacification and communist brainwashing".<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way to the dude who said there are no tests to determine if someone's stoned....WRONG. With a little training it's easy to tell if someone is high just by looking at them, all police officers receive such training long before they first go on duty. <br>  <br>  Precise THC levels can be easily determined through blood tests so not only is it possible to tell if someone is stoned it's also possible to pretty much figure how impaired they really are when it comes to tasks like driving and working around dangerous machinery. Pretty much the same test they would give to see how impaired someone would be with commonly abused prescription medications.  <br>  <br>  There's also a litmus type test done with a simple treated cotton swab that can tell if someone has smoked pot within the last 4 hours.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	I am not altogether against the legalization....but the problem is, it would affect too many things once you regulate it. Plus, given that I believe our officials (many of them) stand to gain too much power by NOT legalizing it. After all, many of them have something to do with it. (See Clinton...Don Henry, Kevin Ives) <<<<<murdered after coming upon a police protected drug drop. (went to school with both of them) Having grown up with Clinton as a governor, I don't see things in black and white anymore.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	No one is going to pay that tax, because all you need is seeds to grow it yourself.  It's not a challenge, everyone would just grow it themselves and it wouldn't make any tax revenue.  The higher the rate of excise tax, the more incentive you provide for people to grow it themselves.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	Yes they are happy and stoned and driving, and doing construction work and installing telephones and patrolling the neighborhoods or putting out fires......RIGHT.  Thanks but no thanks. There is no test that tells you someone is stoned right now. Or how stoned.<br>  <br>  <br>  SFC<br>  US Army<br>  Retired|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Agreed. Marijuana is less addictive than cigarettes. I don't smoke and never will but constitutionally people should have the right to choose if they would like to smoke. Maybe they can ban it in public places such as parks and school grounds.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Maybe. Frankly, I think once the thrill of doing something illegal is gone, a lot of people will quit. But considering the economic circumstances, anything is worth a try! LOL!|`|AA11819105	Ya but a lot of people working for the government would lose their jobs. <br>  Hey we cant have that|`|y4yVmcOVaa	Yes, we would make a ton of money.  According to this economist, we could make 10-14 billion dollars a year.  <a href="http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/</a><br>  <br>  Also, unlike as someone stated earlier, there is a federal restriction on marijuana.  The Controlled Substances act applies to marijuana and does not discriminate between medical usage and other usage.  Some states have medical marijuana laws, and they appear to be valid in court.|`|hWcrvmqYaa	Great questions.  Makes you wonder if Government makes more money by keeping it illegal?<br>  <br>  Heavy Bribes are taken by politicians to get it across the boarder.<br>  <br>  Then it circulates and law enforcement can arrest young black men and put them in jail.<br>  <br>  Now these cops have money and drugs that they circulate back into the streets to produce more arrests, drugs, and money!<br>  <br>  Now that's the Truth!|`|rjEnFSAIaa	Yes, just like a ton of money is currently being made on cigarettes and alcohol.<br>  <br>  And yes, it is illegal on a federal level. That's why medical marijuana dispensaries in California were being raided by federal DEA agents despite it being legal in CA.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	They might make a lot of money but they'll also make a lot of trouble for the non-users who have to put up with the stoner jackasses who would be seizing the moment.|`|U50orfPhaa	Right, like a drug dealer is gonna want to tell the govt they deal it and give them 1/2 of what they make- thats  a laugh!|`|Tkcj5xV0aa	The only reason they dont is because they cant put a tax on.|`|4MNYCMW9aa	So True
Nejnh1Bqaa	While I don't agree with all of your positions, there is one thing that I think we can agree upon.  The Federal Government has grown beyond its boundaries, as set forth in the Constitution.  It has far too much influence over the daily lives of its citizens, and it needs to be reined in.  Domestic issues, for the most part should be under the control of state authorities, not federal authorities.  In the past the Federal government has been in the habit of encroaching on state government by simply granting themselves the right to do so by abusing the 'Necessary and Proper Clause in Article I.  <br>  <br>  It's funny that you should mention prostitution.  It's one of the few issues that the Federal government has not involved itself with.  Probably because it's only legal in two states.|`|zs7aX7iDaa	Time for ALL of us to remember our constitution for the people and by the people  We vote for our selected people in different parties now it seems that these peoople forgot that our taxes pay their salary <br>  It is time for the people to take back our forefathers insight <br>  It would be sad to think that we would allow goverment to have total control and overlook the masterminds that created our unique and wonderful USA|`|zTuc5eDIaa	Libertarians are so idealistic, but extremely naive and unrealistic.

That's pure arrogance. At least have the spine to take a position and say, "yes, I may hurt some people, but I think personal freedoms are worth the risk!"<br>  <br>  Don't play goody-two-shoes with me.

Criminals in Mexico, like here in the US, don't give a damx about firearm laws, do they? <br>  Disarming US citizens, particularly along the border states, will only make it easier for the drug runners and illegals to over run those states when Mexico's govt collapses under the assault from the cartels. <br>  <br>  The liberals / socialists are out for your gun rights.<br>  <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=ind_focus.story&STORY=/www/story/09-24-2008/0004891533&EDATE=WED+Sep+24+2008,+09:24+AM" rel="nofollow">http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/storie...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gunbanobama.com/Default.aspx?NavGuid=baeb7c4b-fed9-4fef-af08-ad7314ed43fe&SiteGuid=c63367a2-996a-422c-9afd-0d6f49a0ca86" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbanobama.com/Default.aspx?...</a><br>  They only need the excuse:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-taU9d26wT4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-taU9d26w...</a>

What a joke!!!!!|`|ixyNeBhWaa	The government is always trying to make presidents look good, or look bad, depending on the situation and tasks they need done in those years a president is in service.<br>  <br>  Politics is a waste of time, they will do what they want, when they want but not always how they want it to happen.<br>  <br>  They give all these false promises and still not one thing has been done to make the  lives  of the poor any better.  <br>  Except to waste more time, how hard is it to make up more money and send it to the poor themselves.<br>  They make up the money when ever they need it.  That's why its easy to give bailouts when supposedly the country is bankrupt.<br>  <br>  So...  are they trying to make Obama seem like a Savior... a God.<br>  Yes.

A further 21,000 personnel were with the Soviet troop contingent over the same period doing various white collar and blue collar jobs.

Many Ron Paul supporters were in evidence, so much so that they were the most visible group. Ron Paul speaks tomorrow and there was considerable anticipation of that event. On the down side there were a number of Sarah Palinites floating around and handing out material. Few neocons in sight. Bolton spoke and signed a book and the hideous David Horowitz was present and also flogging a book demonstrating how American universities have become hotbeds of terrorism.

I don't think it has an thing to do with Democrat or Republican though --- at least not in particular.<br>  <br>  Somewhere in the late 50's, when, for the first time in our history, a middle class with buying power came into being, we began the slow but steady transformation into a country that wanted more cars in the driveway than licensed drivers in the household. HDTV. Snack fridges in the kid's room.<br>  <br>  Closets are no longer large enough, even though they're 3x's the size they were in the 40's.  Dinner plates are nearly twice the size they were in the early 60's. Men used to actually stick their fingers through the little loops on tea cups and not complain about it. <br>  <br>  That was the land before the big mug. And then the bigger mug. <br>  <br>  So. Sure, letting it all crash and burn would seem the normal reaction. Market readjustment. Kids back in bunk beds in the small room off the back. <br>  <br>  Thing is, Americans  aren't going to put up with it. It's a fact. Middle Class used to mean that you owned your own business, the building it was in, and had a couple of employees. Now America wants it to mean that you have a steady job. <br>  <br>  And as it's been redefined, so has the lifestyle expected from it. <br>  <br>  I think we'd survive crash and burn. But it wouldn't be comfortable. And that is what the populace has come to demand. Ultimately, I think this over-inflated lifestyle and mad consumption with the sole reason of habbit WILL be left behind. <br>  <br>  We're all taking up 3-4 times as much space and matter than our grandparents did.

It wasn't a problem with republicans or democrats, it was a problem with US citizens not taking responsibility for their governments actions.  Bush is not solely to blame for the two wars, the deficit or fading civil rights.  All Americans share that blame whether you voted for him or not, because through your inactions you supported it, through your failed protests you allowed it and through your division you encouraged it.

dxMQAdndaa	That article was really interesting, and just goes to show how much we don't learn from our own past.<br>  <br>  To Bob K-<br>  Why should wealthy people have to pay more taxes because they have succeeded in life? Not everyone makes the same amount of money because they have different jobs with varied degrees of difficulty. It's not fair either for "poor" people to live off of money made by others who are taxed ridiculous amounts to fund their illegitimate children.|`|SFnxkS3Raa	this time it looks like a LACK of government "interference" meaning regulation has made us worse off.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	You are absolutely right!!!|`|E9XL5x3Paa	That would be wholly incorrect.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Economies always clean themselves up, that's true.  Problem is how it does it.  It does it by sending the poor out on the streets with nothing at all.  Only the strong (or more accurately said--the wealthy) survive when the economy recedes and then recovers.<br>  <br>  However, people have an innate want to survive.  If the economy is tossing them out and trying to kill them off with starvation, they revolt.  They need to in order to survive.<br>  <br>  Governments step in because they are trying to keep that revolt from happening.  They want to stay in power.<br>  <br>  Had we not moved more toward Socialism to save those poor from being tossed out on the street, they would have revolted.  In fact, that is what has taken down every empire in human history; they let too many poor get tossed out on the streets with nothing, and the poor wouldn't take it anymore.<br>  <br>  America only exists because the government stepped in and kept the poor off the streets, which kept them pacified enough not to revolt.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If we go back to pure Capitalism, you are essentially leaving yourself with a choice.  Are you going to be one of the poor who rises up against the government, probably to die in a rather bloody fight with the military?  Or are you going to be one of the rich who is overthrown and killed off in that uprising?<br>  <br>  It is coming anyway.  It is the nature of humanity.  We simply are not perfect enough to handle things, so it always gets bad enough for revolt.  We are only delaying it at the moment.  The only question is, are you ready for "give me liberty or give me death?"<br>  <br>  Because that is a false choice.  The true question is, are you ready for "give me death by revolt or death by starvation?"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  Capitalism does not say that much about a government, whether having one or not; and it can be used with or without a government.<br>  <br>  Communism is no government at all.  Most people don't know that, mostly because of the propaganda machine of both the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  What the Soviet Union had was Fascism, that they called Communism.  It was nowhere close.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  And what I am reacting to is not the various bubbles that have since "popped," but the Capitalism we once used.<br>  <br>  Businesses used the facts that people needed to eat, and that they were competing with each other for jobs, to keep wages low and with no benefits.<br>  <br>  Then the poor workers would get mangled up in factory accidents and such, or simply could not afford to live on their meager wages, and then get tossed out on the street.  They had no medical benefits or workman's compensation, and simply died out there without the ability to feed themselves.<br>  <br>  Then the workers started out protesting this treatment with Unions, and the businesses started trying to get the government to step in and crush the unions and force the workers back to work.  The government tried to oblige the businesses, until the workers started threatening to revolt violently.<br>  <br>  The government realized what could, and probably would, happen; considering the size of the angered individuals.  The government realized it would not be around tomorrow if they didn't fix the mess the businesses had created.  So they stepped in, and socialized some things.  <br>  <br>  The 40 hour workweek, overtime pay if you are asked to work past that, weekends off, holidays off and holiday pay if you do work them, medical insurances, vacation, sick pay, family leave, maternity leave, social security, military leave (jobs not replaced if they go to fight in the military), 401k retirement plans, retirement at all...All of these things and more are Socialist ideas.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	Because most people dont understand the economy.And 60% of our citizens gets some form of welfare now and the only thing they worry about is how much they are going to get.|`|30a4ee65246d549232fafd90921ce359aa	They did not pay attention in class, they are not economists, and they could not think their way out of a paper sack.|`|KZh3x4g9aa	dude,you get the GOLDEN DUDE AWARD   for your perception about the stupidity of the bozos on this forum...|`|otYOxmnuaa	Because they shant be bothered with economics as part of their curriculum growing up.<br>  <br>  The New Deal?  <br>  World War II was responsible for ending the depression w/ increased production and manufacturing jobs -- invigorating all industries associated w/ building military equipment.<br>  <br>  Did the new deal have an impact? <br>  Yes, it created an artificial bottom that prolonged the depression.  <br>  <br>  It was also successful at spending 10% of GDP per year trying to get a strangle on unemployment.  <br>  <br>  Did it work?  <br>  Kind of...but at what cost?<br>  -To put it in perspective, it'd be like us spending at least 1.3 trillion dollars per year.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Bob:  "Somebody should have told that to Bush 8 years ago with all his tax cuts for the wealthy."<br>  <br>  Those tax cuts (for the rich -- which were actually for everyone, including the bottom 30% who don't pay taxes) paid for themselves in 5 years (adjusted for inflation) -- they also returned more tax-revenue than did Clinton's tax-hikes.  <br>  www.bea.gov<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to acknowledge that the strategy works but the numbers don't lie.

In the early part of the Civil War, Lincoln's emphasis was on the preservation of the Union. <br>  <br>  While the historical record shows that preserving slavery was the reason for the rebellion, ending slavery became one of the objectives only around the middle of the war (after the Emancipation Proclamation).  <br>  <br>  It's not that it is being taught wrong, just sloppy.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Look at the Lincoln Douglas debates.

Kinda sounds like Venezuela.  <br>  <br>  And when he is turned down for money by these other countries, who are in bad shape too, he will start printing money that will lead to super-inflation.  If you look close enough you can see how this is all coming to a head.  High tax rates, low market values, high gold prices, falling dollar, and low oil prices, high unemployment.   These low oil prices will bring foreign countries that supply us to a halt.  <br>  <br>  When Bush cut taxes in 2003 the effect was the creation of 8 million jobs!  Obama spending like mad and promises to save or create 3.5 million.  Something just does not sound logical here.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Isnt a long recession a depression?|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	LOL how dense to you have to be to say "neither?" <br>  <br>  What planet are these people on? WOW, you guys are gonna have some fun! (by which I mean you're as good as dead)...<br>  <br>  I am not sure how long it will be (that depends on a number of factors, and my crystal ball is on the fritz right now)...<br>  <br>  ...but it's already a depression. There's no getting around that. Remember when the MSM was still refusing to use the word "recession" until we were about 6 months into it already? Same deal.<br>  <br>  And it will probably become hyper-inflationary by the end of 2009 (unless the universe explodes or something)...<br>  <br>  @ Professor, there is some truth in what you say, but I would not quite put it that way... <br>  <br>  ...smart people do not "sit on money" leading into a hyper-inflationary depression! They use it, while they can, to consolidate power and buy up real-world assets at fire-sale prices... as they are already doing... with the 10 trillion in TARP funds that the Fed issued out of thin air for their bankster underlings.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: ".." (skull avatar guy) edited his answer.... so I've edited mine ... I totally agree with him! <br>  <br>  I suppose a "total collapse" is really "neither." So actually, that's a fair answer. My sincere apologies sir! I misunderstood.<br>  <br>  And that's obviously the policy... to completely collapse the global economy (which is why the globalists pegged everything to the dollar... and now they are destroying the dollar). <br>  <br>  A global crisis calls for a global "solution," right? Order out of chaos? Hmmmm???|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Neither. Present policy is a rapid total collapse like the Wiemar Republic.<br>  It will be HYPERinflationary. Look for the $50,000 box of granola coming soon to a grocery store near you.

In fact, we are entering a new era.  Life in America as we know it is changing, and quickly. <br>  <br>  The only people who don't already know that are people who get their news from the mainstream media and believe the talking points of the politicians.<br>  <br>  If you need some independent media links, please email and I would be happy to share.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	Obamabots will believe in Barry Obama's lies  and leave their money in the stock market or even buy more stock seeking "bargains"<br>  <br>  Only a fool predicts a market bottom or buys into a falling market.<br>  <br>  One Term Barry will lose his re-election bid over the Obama Depression.|`|6cm6MB66aa	I think it will boom .

iUQezshOaa	Hi April,<br>   Yes we are in a recession, have been for over a year, and headed for a depression. Very close.<br>  <br>  Our governments are attempting to turn our economy around, but may be making things worse.<br>  <br>  How will this affect me? Hard to say how or if the effects will alter my continuing education.<br>  Many people are finding that online education is better for them. No parking problems, all night parties, etc.<br>  <br>  Prices will continue to rise and the cost of living will also go higher, until or if the government makes some changes.
aipChC3haa	That's just how they roll.|`|pi5WKPNwaa	I don't see Republicans as pessimistic, I see them as realist. Republicans don't get tingling feelings in their legs when we hear the Lord Obama speak like the main stream media dose.  If you want to see a true pessimistic, look at Obama. He is always talking about how bad everything is. NEWS FLASH: The economy has been in worse shape. History has showed us that a resection will fix it’s self in around 18 months if left alone.  With all that the LEFT is doing we are sure to extend this resection.  Republicans are mad and can see how bad Obama and the left are making things.  If that makes us pessimistic so be it, someone has to stand up and fight for what is right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZyKZr9e4aa	Unfortunately Obama has given us a lot to pessimistic about.<br>  Although he's got a pretty pessimistic outlook as well, trying to scare all of us into going along with everything he wants by warning us that if we don't, the country will fall into another Great Depression. I think he is exxagerating quite a bit.|`|rxQt7auLaa	Is it pessimism?  Or realism?<br>  <br>  Experience has shown that bailouts do not provide anywhere near the benefit they promise.  Nor is it likely that most of the promises of the current administrations fiscal policy will provide the benefits promised.<br>  <br>  Let's take the health care situation.  By moving all the records to a electronic format, there is supposed to be some kind of huge savings to the medical community.  (that savings does not take into account the costs of moving to an electronic format by the way).  Of course, the insurance companies and the doctors will pass that savings on to the health care consumer, right?  (If you believe that, I got some nice land to sell you real cheap.)<br>  <br>  Same thing with the "shovel ready" projects creating jobs.  For the most part, the construction industry employment is doing quite well.  So, these huge numbers promised from funding construction jobs will probably not show up.  And, exactly how many jobs will be created by large sums of money going to ACORN?<br>  <br>  And the housing bailout.  Now, that's a good one.  "Congratulations!  You did the right thing and purchased a house that you could afford, and paid your mortgage on time.  Here's your reward, you get to pay someone else's mortgage as well."<br>  <br>  Please explain exactly why I should be optimistic about any of that?|`|ASXeYOjAaa	What makes you think they are?<br>  I look at a plan to repeat the Wiemar Republic's fiscal policy and unlike the Democrats I don't tell you the result will be 180 degrees opposite of what happened before. Rather, I tell you the result will probably be very similar. Does that make me pessimistic? If you think so, you need a new glossary.|`|kzNnMrMHaa	Because they don't believe in extreme socialism that borders on Neo-Marxism. We are but one or two steps shy of total federal control over the citizens, business and banks being nationalized, and the basic rights of free speech and thought and the right to bear arms are in jeopardy. That is communism.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	you have that *** backwards,  Democrat is the name your trying to find, but cant, learn to read first, than ask.|`|6cm6MB66aa	Because they see all that they worked  for and people they  in slaved all go out the door .  They now fear they must reeducate and do actual work for themselves|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	I am optimistic as hell.   I cashed out of the stock market last May and am sitting on a cash position.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Common sense says spending trillions more then you have coming in will eventually bankrupt you.  And yes we thought this while Bush was President too, before SOMEONE says it. LOL|`|2rcSILkWaa	They weren't breast fed.|`|CM1dfztQaa	Just because we seem paranoid, doesn't mean they aren't out to get us.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Its called being realistic. Try it sometime.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	you know the Republicans are wrong about some things , but at least they take credit for mistakes and try to get things right for American , contrary to the Democrats who tell the Republicans that they are stupid and the Dems. do not want or need their help in any way , besides this way they can share all that Pork from the stimulus bill with other Democrats . God forbid that either party should think about working for the common good of American and Americans .|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Not just Republicans.

Except for the black republicans. Both of them are smart enough to disagree with Obama's political stances, as opposed to the man himself.<br>  3) They think Mrs. Obama is ugly; therefore a racist. I don't understand, either. <br>  4) They can't fathom that policies other than their own could actually work.<br>  5) They are suffering from money withdrawal brought about by Bush.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	They aren't.  Reps aren't the ones saying we're in a depression.  Reps aren't the ones saying we need to cripple our country with debt right now to avoid a disaster. Reps aren't the ones saying America will fall apart in a few years.  Reps aren't the ones saying the world will become too hot to grow crops in.  Reps aren't the ones saying the economy may never recover.  Reps aren't the ones saying this is the worst economic crisis since WWII, since the Depression, as bad as the Depression, or worse then the Depression.  In fact, all have been said by the Dems and by the media (yeah, I know there isn't a distinction between the two anymore).  Stop buying the crap CNN is selling you, and throw away the falsehoods and learn to depend on facts for once.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	pessimistic, or realistic?  pessimism over the marxist agenda that current is being thrust on our society.  realistic, there is an opportunity to seize on this as an opportunity if we choose our cards correctly.

UpZFb6X5aa	Fortunately, real Americans--and capitalists--don't think that way.<br>  <br>  If someone can do a job better or cheaper-that's the capitalist. He/she will end up creating more jobs--and a bigger market. Exampee: 20 years ago a laserprinter cost $500-100. Most people had to by sh**t y dot-matrix printers. Now--we buy good color printers for $75. And everyone has one. And tere are more jobs--and more businesses-as a result.<br>  <br>  The people who whine about a competitor who can do the job for less are the socialists. They don't want capitalism--they want a guaranteed income. They don't want to active. They are losers who want to eliminate the free market because they cant handle the competition.<br>  <br>  Someone like that should lose his buisness. The conservatives see m to think that's "socialist." It's not it's free market competition.|`|klj3cOFPaa	In your second paragraph, you suggest that business owners who suck $300,000 out of the business for personal benefit could forgo that high amount and instead plow money back into the business.  Business owners often choose to forgo taking all profit out of the business in order to plow some of the money back into the business.  That's a perfectly valid business decision.  <br>  <br>  I don't see how that concept is even remotely connected to the idea of going out of business altogether, and I certainly don't see how that would make anything cheaper.  If most dry cleaners go out of business, getting your clothes dry cleaned is not going to get cheaper--the opposite will happen.|`|Wq8vQqvbaa	Obamanomics = Trickle Up Poverty!|`|4eLzY2hfaa	i think that you are hanging around with people that don't, or can't think!|`|bMtBtYDsaa	They can say and do whatever they want...ignorance never prevails.<br>   Its greed the same reason we are in this mess...|`|7HdgMaOnaa	please put down the crack pipe|`|OLCoFKQraa	That sounds insanely stupid, I've never met anyone who thinks that way.|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	You're not alone.

l5TKAStKaa	Not evil, but a super stupid dumb-***, just like my next-door neighbor.

I don't think pot smokers fit in this category.  No other people are harmed by the activity, as long as they don't have to breathe secondary smoke.<br>  <br>  You do not speak for all non-stoners, I am one such and I disagree with you.<br>  <br>  I am not waiting for this to be legalised so I can partake, I have no interest in that at all.  I simply believe in freedom of the individual as long as they do not harm others or society.<br>  <br>  Stoners are an extreme example, but others partake moderately.  The same can be said of alcohol.  Moderate drinkers are not a problem, but a minority abuse it and cause problems to themselves and others.  I do not see this as a reason to prohibit alcohol, only as a reason to licence and regulate it.<br>  <br>  There are indeed health issues, but only on the partakers, not on other people.  Hence I find no moral objection to the activity.  I do not object to people climbing mountains, running in front of bulls at Spanish festivals, or crossing the road.  It's their risk.  I don't want a nanny state.<br>  <br>  I share the concern of those that don't want to breathe in other's dope smoke, but this applies equally to cigarette smoke. I'm happy to have it banned in all public places.<br>  <br>  Society has a proportion of people who are less productive and may abuse all sorts of substances.  I do not see that prohibition would put such people off abusing this - if anything, it would boost the criminal activities to produce and supply, as legal regulated supply would not exist.  If we banned everything that *some* people abuse, there wouldn't be much left that we're allowed to do.<br>  <br>  I do find it a pretty pointless and distasteful habit, but that's my personal taste.  I also don't like eggs, but that's not a reason why I should prohibit others from eating them.  My personal taste is not a basis for morality or legislation.<br>  <br>  As such, I profoundly disagree with you.|`|e7ffbc62329968ff41737d8cb3fa8c26aa	lol, interesting question laced with false assumptions.  i am not a smoker.  but have you considered that alchohol is FAR more dangerous, and yet pot is illegal?  I have not met ONE angry or violent stoner. I tell you one thing.  If marijuana were legalized it would bring in a TON of tax revenue.  It quite possible could solve our current economic problems singlehandedly.  <br>  Have you considered any of that?|`|Rq5dEYwOaa	You need to get out of that rock your living under, all pot smokers are not evil. That is ridiculous. <br>  <br>  I am not a smoker, but I don't need you to speak for me.|`|9VRwBeATaa	My troll senses are tingling.<br>  <br>  You either are just a troll looking to offend and get kicks, or are a sad lonely individual who needs to get out more. Perhaps both?|`|19xkT6KBaa	You can't say your safely speaking for all non-stoners.<br>  <br>  I know a lot of people who will never try smoking pot in their lifetimes but they don't hate people who do smoke it. At the end of the day, people have lives and they will and do, live them how they see fit. Culture and society isn't being destroyed by those who do smoke either, well, not in the way you've put it. Personally I think that terroism, war, this stupid financial crisis among other stuff is higher on the 'things that are destroying culture' than people who smoke weed. Everyone is entitled to an opinion but you can't go around just assuming that everyone who does something you don't agree with is a useless waste of space. <br>  <br>  A lot of so called 'stoners' have jobs and do them well. They use it to occasionally chill out and relax with friends, whether those friends smoke it or not.|`|b1hXdKHCaa	Your rant already indicates that you are ready to wail on anyone who does not agree with you. But you asked, so I'll give it a shot:<br>  <br>  I'm not a user, I completely disagree with it's use, including for medical reasons. I believe that the existing Federal laws should be enforced, regardless of state laws that allow it. I believe that users present a potential risk to society as drivers and workers in many jobs. <br>  <br>  But overall, marijuana poses less of a risk than alchohol and other drugs, including some prescription drugs. So I don't think "as severly as possible" applies. If we only had room in the jails for one: either a drunk driver or marijuana user, I'd pick the drunk driver. Crack-head or pot-user: crack-head. But, between public drunkeness and pot-DEALER, I would choose the dealer. It's all relative.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Dude, what are you SO angry about?

AA10690306	So, you are saying those though out history who have used what was and is considered a medicinal herb are evil like Jesus and Mohammad?|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	I disagree whole heartedly.<br>  <br>  You are entitled to your opinions no matter how far misguided I view them as.<br>  <br>  Do you agree with me that pushing your beliefs on others is wrong?  Nevermind, I already know the answer.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Utter nonsense!<br>  <br>  The fact that you are already dismissing arguments against your position as coming from potheads just shows your mind is closed to facts and logic.<br>  <br>  If you want to find a drug in modern times that is far more dangerous to society, it's alcohol.  It is far more dangerous then Marijuana.  Why aren't you calling for the banning of booze?  Oh wait, we tried that as a nation, and it was a miserable failure, just as keeping pot illegal has been.  <br>  <br>  Pot smokers don't tend to get violent and don't get into fights nearly as easy as drinkers.  Pot smokers don't get cirrhosis of the liver or alcohol poisoning either.  <br>  <br>  Just for your reference, I'm in my mid-40s.  I've tried pot twice when I was about 18.  Quite frankly, I didn't like it.  It irritated my throat and did nothing for me that a few drinks couldn't do.  Despite plenty of opportunities, I've never had any since then. If it becomes legal, I have no intention of starting either.|`|JthubNIsaa	I don't smoke pot and I don't appreciate you speaking for me on this. If folks want to smoke pot, it's their choice. I imagine it won't be long before the Government legalizes it to tax the crap out of it. They already grow it for medical consumption which is completely abused.|`|DQT5ZDSPaa	Is that you Dwight? Dwight Schrute?  Is it?|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Sarcasm?|`|25Cu0kjFaa	I never smoked pot. After a few tries, I found I didn't like the effects.<br>  <br>  However, I strongly disagree with you. Marijuana is no worse and no better than alcohol. Like any drug, it can be used or abused.<br>  <br>  I supported California's medical marijuana initiative because I believe that it has uses in pain relief and appetite aid.<br>  <br>  I support legalization because we can tax hemp and marijuana, and hemp has myriad industrial uses that we can exploit. We could replace the tobacco belt with a hemp belt.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	No. <br>  <br>  But , then, I'm not an ignorant and bigoted redneck who doesn't know anything about and likes to tell lies about people he doesn't even know.|`|WDVyEpRNaa	lol?<br>  <br>  i think this question is sarcastic possibly?<br>  <br>  and why are you so obsessed over this? <br>  <br>  you've clearly chosen to solo out someone elses vices in order to avoid your own..|`|n2kBUWQOaa	I disagree.

He can speak well and make people feel nice.<br>   If you prefer style over substance. If you prefer community organizers and voter fraud operatives that are bringing forth a new nation, conceived in Socialism, and dedicated to the proposition that we are created to be subservient to the government.  Then I guess Obama will last a little while. <br>  <br>  If you believe in the things that have always made this nation great: free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, a strong national defense, and the rule of law.

That said, I believe that the quest for nuclear power is less important to consider as a means to change the world order of power.  The concept of abundant energy that can be used for a peaceful purpose is the target here.  The nonproliferation treaty to which Iran is a party states that peaceful usage of said energy is permissible.  Only North Korea has broken from the ranks to demonstrate world order power display.  The real problems of the  development of nuclear power is still unknown today, that is why it is considered a very dangerous program to start.

sgEloO1Jaa	MEPS is a boring long process. Its pretty much hurry up and wait all day. Since its your first time they will have you move around alot. You have to pee test, asvab, eyes, ears, draw blood, all that good stuff. Be prepared to answer a million questions about your entire life and do alot of sitting around. The Navy liason that interviews you will be more up front with you then your recruiter. They will dicuss the jobs you want and put them on a list. Then once thats done they will write up a contract and you will go to swear in. Dont get too excited about swearing in the first time youre only swearing into DEP (Delayed Entry Program). They are going to tell you there is no turning back but they are full of it. You can back out at anytime before swearing in the day you ship out. Once you swear in the day you ship out then theres no turning back. Have fun and good luck.|`|3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	MEPS is extremely boring and extremely long.

I see a country that has been through a huge change. The rich generous class Oprah, Gates, Buffet have sacrificed the most for the country to do well. The poorest people have been taught how to live a life where they can fully function. The whiners are doing terribly because they resisted this time of change & think the world has ended b/c they don't have houses anymore or even internet service. They live in a rut but no one cares cause of their caustic attitude. I will probably move even though I love where I am & the way my life is b/c I want to be closer to more people & quicker at getting to places. The mind of us all will be so obvious. The days of someone like John McCain getting in the Naval Academy because his mother is an oil heiress & father's pull will be over. It is going to be a time of what is known as cash karma. We watched OJ wondering if justice would ever be served & it took 10 years. It is going to be very different. People will understand how there word is energy & what they say & how they treat others & how they choose to feel is like a seed that creates their life. So we will have a huge gap between the rich & poor but it will be b/c of attitudes not because of gifts people were giving but b/c of the gifts that we give to others. It is happening now & as you see the people on here who are predicting doom & gloom they will get it. It will be done unto them as they believe.

58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	He used the excuse of slavery to invade the south. When he really didnt care if the slaves were free or not. If you look at the Lincoln Douglas debates and some of his journal writings you will see I speak the truth.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	If I remember my history right, here goes.  Lincoln was a republican, they were anti-slavery.  He campaigned against extending slavery, not abolishing it.  He and everyone knew that the existence of the south as it was,  there was no way they could end slavery in the area.  The North depended on the south to produce for them too.  What happened was the south took offense to his position and said that they would secede from the union if he won.  Lincoln was not about to let this happen.  When the south did it though the war began and Lincoln thought it would be an easy win.  He was wrong and completely underestimated the south's will to keep their way of life.  When it looked like the war would never end, Lincoln had a meeting to see if deporting all the slaves would work to end the war.  Things starting getting so bad and the deaths were high on the Union's side.  They had to get immigrants, that could not even speak English to fight for the Union, they were running out of men.  That is when Lincoln decided to free the slaves, it was to end the war.  Which it did.  The south was kept under military law for years and made to suffer greatly for the treason that Lincoln believed they committed.<br>  <br>  There were hardly any northern slaves.  When the slaves were free some headed north.  They were not completely welcome.  The Northerners were not accustomed to them and their ways.  It made things a bit uncomfortable for all.  Most of the slaves returned to the south and returned to their previous owners or were given land by the federal government to live on.|`|pVLJxzzlaa	I am still wondering that myself..He didn't free the slaves,only in the confederate,which he had no power. I guess he was so distraught about the union, he could only verbalize a concern..Gettysburg Address.He was a Republican..that about all I can rationalize..
nDvrN6Qgaa	Yes as a matter of fact you can.  But do you really want to?  The chances of loss or damage are pretty high in basic.  My own wedding band went through 21 years being abused on a tank, and believe me it looks like it.  I have to admit it also tore my finger up pretty badly whenever I charged a machine gun wrong.  I would leave it at home or take some sore of small box or bag for it and lock it in you locker at basic.  Good luck to you.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	You may wear them. I am not married, but wore a plain regular ring. I don't know if they still are but rings are authorized. Just not flashy ones and you can only wear one per hand.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind two important things when wearing rings.<br>  <br>  1. you are likely to loose weight even in your hands and the ring will fit looser and you may loose it. If you loose a lot of weight the ring can slip off while training. I had to take my ring off because I lost too much weight.<br>  <br>  2. Rings can be a safety hazard. You can get your finger caught in stuff when wearing a ring.<br>  <br>  One more thing to remember...<br>  <br>  Unfortunately there are thieves in Boot Camp. Some people will steal anything. You have to be careful  if you ever take it off to shower or go through an obstacle course or other training. If you take it off because you lost too much weight lock it up tightly. Do not ever set it out or put it in your pocket. You will loose the ring if you do not lock it up when you aren't wearing it for what ever reason.|`|K8qAniReaa	It is better to leave all your jewelry at home.

Besides, a lot of us are getting this wrong... in terminology anyway. He is not giving amnesty because an amnesty is a pardon WITHOUT fines (like the 1986 amnesty). What he is doing is actually helping the economy a bit by charging them a HUGE fine on top of the regular fees a legal immigrant would have to pay. I think it's going to be 2500 per head ($30,000,000,000 IF we say it's 12 million but since you say it's 38million then it's $95,000,000,000 in revenue for the U.S.!!). Mulitply that by 12 million and you've got a pretty good chunk of money. In "legal" terms this is called a LEGALIZATION bc he is charging them. An amnesty is just like "Ok you're forgiven but just fill these papers out".<br>  <br>  EDIT: Well, 12 million isnt downplaying. I mean it's common sense that's a LOT of ppl. And Whoa! You are saying all illegals kill and rape? That's like saying all whites are KKK members and molest children. I think what you meant to ask if i'm pro-legalization? Well it depends. A lot of these immigrants, like MANY of the FORGOTTEN IRISH that came here illegally in the early 1800s, have proven they are good people and do pay annual taxes with the help of a number called ITIN. They pay taxes every time they buy something, period. But anyway i do think we should give some the opportunity to prove themselves. If not, deport them, done. For those who do have a FELONY record, no. Deport them back. Besides, dont you think that if we had been enforcing our borders a looong time ago we would be going through this now? Why isnt USCIS deporting them like they've always said? There's a hidden agenda and you know it bc when our government wants something done, it gets it done. It's their fault as much as it is ours.

Death and injury was FALLING before 55, leveled off then resumed FALLING when 55 was canceled.

At least you'll get something for all the trouble they caused.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	no i don't believe they could. HOWEVER at 3am, sadly this is pretty par for the course and a lot of waitstaff have it taken out of their check. it sounds like you were one of the "straws that broke the camels back".  it sounds like you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. the "dine and dash" does happen a lot and usually at the close of the bars! so.... thankfully it sounds like the partner believed you and the waitress didn't push it.  sorry you got cranky people AND stupid friends.... eer people you know as you're right - they weren't good friends!|`|jHXUNbYGaa	No, you are not required by law to pay.  Secondly, the police could not have arrested you.  For everyone stating that you could have been arrested, tell me what the charge would be?  Yep, that is right, no law!<br>  <br>  For the ones who state she should pay, YOU know you would not have paid!  You are telling me that if someone sits down at your table and you do not know this person, but it is a friend of your friends and they leave, you are going to pay!  I do not think so!|`|9HdexsSCaa	It was on you to pay. You should have paid and now you caused an innocent party (the waitress) to get stuck with it. The only reason you didn't get arrested is because the only witness (the waitress) bailed you out and then you stiffed her for it. Nice.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	You should have paid the bill, the waitress will likely have to pay it, and she is not friends with either you our your friend's friend, or your friend.  You should have paid, and asked your friend to reimburse you.  That would have been the "right thing" to do.<br>  <br>  Let your friend know what happened, maybe he didn't know.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
nDvrN6Qgaa	Well...okay now.  Not sure how the Guard works it, I was RA, but after a year's absence I would say you have probably been dropped from the rolls as a deserter which is a whole lot different than AWOL.  If you are serious about doing the right thing then the answer is clear.  Return to your Guard unit and fess up.  Don't know what more help I can be.  Good luck to you pal.|`|7idyT7Obaa	have a friend there that you trust to not raise any flags? ask him to check around.|`|on8MjVTcaa	How do you fix it? Avoiding it isn't helping. You need to turn contact your Reserve Center and discuss turning yourself in. You may do a bit of restriction time but it won't last terribly long and then they'll discharge you. Probably Bad COnduct or Other than Honorable.<br>  <br>  Its the only way to fix it. Anything else is just a continuation of the issue.
lcNQ2w57aa	You don't get your charges dropped because of a typo.<br>  <br>  They will reschedule and you will suffer the consequences.

He was arrested when he was a juvenile and will have the case heard by juvenile court.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you, uh, your friend will lose his license until he is 21, heavy fines adn probation.|`|JtTpfCMHaa	You asked<br>  <br>   what's Happening to A court?<br>  <br>  <br>  What is the question?<br>  What court? <br>  You give us nothing to really answer??<br>  <br>  <br>  Just more proof that drinking seriously does wreck a person's brain cells<br>  <br>  <br>  Your "Friend" and you need to start heading to counseling and AA now at least that way when they do correct the type and bring you err i mean the "friend" back at least you all look like you are facing the facts that you have a drinking problem and are trying to fix it.
eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	You may or may not be able to be emancipated in Missouri.  I have seen some evidence to support both positions.  My guess though is that you have to obey your parents until you turn 18 in Missouri and cannot move out.  I would however take advice from a legal-aid lawyer.|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	you have to be 18.<br>  sorry..<br>  you can go stay with them but they arent your gaurdian and your parents can call the cops and get you back home. unless there is abuse going on then i would call the cops on the parents if it isnt a safe environment..but it its just cause you dont want to live there..not a good enough excuse..sorry|`|AA10045620	Yes, the cops will make you go home and your b/f parents could get into trouble for harboring you in their home.  You area a 16 year old minor.  Wait until you reach adult status.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Yes, unless those people become legal guardians.  You have to stay with your parents until you are 18.<br>  <br>  You are thinking of special circumstances with gifted kids going to college early, but that's not your case.|`|AyiDXBTxaa	You'd only be able to move out legally if your home was in Missouri.
OiAl6w48aa	Yes they can.  It is likely that they have a landlord's lien over your property, or the court ordered it be sold to satisfy your obligation.  So while your ex-landlord may be an f-ing idiot, he's right on this point.|`|eulMjLtPaa	If you cannot take your personal belongings with you on the day you move, you need to tell your landlord that you will be returning for your belongings. However, if you don’t tell your landlord that you plan to come to get your things, you may be considered to be abandoning your personal property, especially if it does not appear to be of any value. <br>  <br>  The landlord must allow you access to remove your personal property, otherwise the landlord is committing what is called "conversion" of your belongings.|`|htSZsds7aa	Yes if they evicted u due to not paying the rent.
bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	It would be your word against hers that she ever agreed to extend the lease. I would send a letter to her saying my lease is good until midnight of March 10th 2009. It sound to me like she is the one who is not honoring the lease by wanting you to be out before legally it is up.|`|AA10123414	You have no proof of your verbal agreement. She has proof of the written agreement and the written notice that she is not extending to month to month. better plan on moving out by the end of the lease.<br>  <br>  Right now the letter the lawyer sent cost you nothing. On the 10th it will cost you what it cost her. Plan on spending around $1,000 extra if she evicts you.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	The verbal agreement is enforceable as an unilateral obligation, but you'll find it extremely hard to prove. <br>  <br>  The landlord cannot force you to quit the lease before the due day. If it states that it runs till March 10th, you can stay till March 10th.|`|7VzvI4Wgaa	. tenant with a written lease should read the lease carefully to see whether or not he/she has given up the right to receive this eviction notice. The eviction notice must be personally delivered to the tenant or posted on the dwelling. An eviction notice, sent by mail is probably not enforceable. A written lease may state how many days notice must be given by the landlord before the landlord can evict. It the lease does not state how much notice is required, the general rule is as follows: If the term has ended, or it the landlord claims the tenant has breached the lease, the landlord must give the tenant thirty (30) days notice if the lease is for less than one year (this is usually month-to-month), and ninety (90) days notice if the lease is one year or more. If the tenant is behind in the rent and has an oral lease with the landlord, the landlord needs to give only fifteen (15) days notice between April 1st and September 1st, but thirty (30) days notice between September 1st and April 1st. It the tenant is not out of the property by the end of the eviction notice, the landlord must follow the procedure through the District Justice's office as set forth in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 below. check you lease.
jthpq6Egaa	All these answers, some partially right and some wrong.  So for all you people, as a dual military married couple they are both entitled to BAH without dependents (well, I'm only speculating you have no children).  And because they have no dependents, they're not entitled to stay in the barracks (because they're married) or on post housing (because they have no dependents).  As a result, off post is the only place they can reside.  And even if they had dependents and one of them resided on post, they would both still receive BAH (one with dependents and the other without).  The only thing is that the BAH with dependents would be directly paid to post housing.<br>  <br>  Now, the regulation that covers BAH is the JFTR (Joint Federal Travel Regulation),Chapter 10, Part C.  I've added some links below that hopefully will help.<br>  <br>  Also, have both of you done to DEERS and updated your marriage status?  If not, both of you need to do so.  Afterwards, visit your pay office (it is the end of the month so most posts allow for "pay day activities" directly with finance) and talk to them about it.  Or submit a pay inquiry with a copy of your marriage certificate and DEERS printout requesting the BAH you're entitled to.  Also, ensure that in your pay inquiry you request to back date the BAH to your date of marriage or the date when you were "kicked out" of the barracks (a memo from the commander will suffice).|`|9tcv3TiWaa	You are not considered a Geographical Bachelor if you are Dual Military and living in barracks, you will not get BAH w/o dependents at all.  If you both live off post and have shown a lease agreement or mortgage then you will qualify for BAH w/o dependents unless there is children in the picture, then you would qualify for BAH w/dependents.     Check with the Per Diem/BAH website they should have the FAQS in there authorizing the BAH.|`|be8558170517e11de3a13500ca72ff48aa	- Department of Defense (DOD) Pay Regulation, Volume 7A (Active Duty & Reserve Pay), Chapter 26 -- Basic Allowance For Housing (BAH).<br>  <br>  - Army Regulation 37–104–4, Military Pay and Allowances Policy, Chapter 12|`|AA10123414	Neither of you are qualified for BAH as both of you live on base or have availability on base.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You are both entitled to single rate BAH.  If you live in quarters, you are not entitled to BAH.<br>  <br>  Not sure how it works while you are deployed.  A visit to JAG would do wonders for both him and you.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	There is no reg that says that.<br>  <br>  Just because you live off post, doesn't mean you are authorized BAH.<br>  <br>  Your husband is NOT a geo bachelor.<br>  <br>  Since you are eligible to join him. ( by his orders, his spouse can join him )<br>  <br>  I surprised they are even letting you live off post at all and not having to maintain a room in the Barracks.<br>  <br>  Dual Married couples without children, stationed at separate Post, <br>  <br>  Are not automaticly authorized BAH, <br>  <br>  In fact, most post force you into the barracks and treat you as a single soldier.|`|014NXPfFaa	You can only get BAH if you (both or either) live off base. If you live on base you wont get BAH.  Even if you both lived off base you'd each only get partial BAH, they wont give you both full BAH.
3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	Yes, you can, provided your parents/guardians sign off on it. I know the Army has a program that lets you go through Basic the summer between your junior and senior years called "Split Option," and then when you graduate they'll send you to your advanced individual training (AIT).

With parental consent.<br>  But I believe parents who do allow their underage son/daughter to join the army or the military for that matter should get their *** kicked.|`|K8qAniReaa	Yes.

This is all kinda new, since people have started flocking to the armed forces for a job.<br>  <br>  Raising the educational standards allows the armed forces to recruit from a higher standard.  It's all about supply and demand !|`|DQlZIzAFaa	With parental permission and if you have graduated from high school.

The only reason for you to want to join the Army Guard would be to serve while you are going to college.|`|sBuwi7qFaa	you dont have to be smart to be a marine.<br>  marines are generally not to educated.<br>  go through nrotc to be an officer and to get some of your college paid for.<br>  <br>  officers ususally get more freedom.|`|CWlKnQPuaa	you have a huge IQ, average is about 110, are you sure that test is correct.|`|5xRY3uS7aa	You sound as if you are committed enough, so go the Marine route.But as I'm a former Army Paratrooper, I have to disagree about the Marines being the best:)  Good luck.|`|sji1rKawaa	what did you get on your ASVAB?
YTG3bCeDaa	The job that doesn't require standing a field and getting shot at.|`|2zym4J9xaa	The Army is probably the branch you're looking for.  They have over 90% of all Special Ops.

They have the most opportunities and the most room for advancement.<br>  <br>  The Marines has basically infantry and that's it.. they have Force Recon but that is for a select few.<br>  <br>  The Navy... forget it... unless you are a SEAL. (70% washout rate)... then you are a sailor boy on a ship.<br>  <br>  Air Force... again they don't have Special Forces... they have a few guys that are Pararescue and you will never make it (95% washout rate) no PJ would ever be on this board asking questions.<br>  <br>  As far as Special Ops go... tha Army is the best way to go by far.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice, I was wondering if you have any clue what you're doing.  Especially when you ruled out the Army and they're the branch with all the majority of Special Ops guys in it.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	First thing what do you like? The military has all different jobs that mirror jobs in civilian life.  Every job has some reward to it and some downside.  You will have chose job for yourself.  In the military I did 15 different jobs and enjoyed them all. and got mad too.  It is what you make it.|`|K8qAniReaa	The best job for you depends on what you like to do or what you want to do.  Which branch you choose depends on what you want out of the military.<br>  <br>  The term "special forces" means something different in every branch.  The Marines have their Recon units.The Army has Rangers, and Calvary and a thing called special forces but Army special forces isn't what most people think it is.  The Navy has SEALS, Divers, and SWCCs.  The Air Force has security forces which is like a combat version of their MPs. Every branch has EOD. <br>  <br>  What do you want to do?  Why do you want to be "special forces"?|`|5xRY3uS7aa	Special forces are good, but you mentioned Navy and Air force. I, like you, wanted to do neat stuff and blow stuff up. And I did. But years later I was talking to a friend who was in the Navy. He had the best job I ever heard of. He was a Machinist mate on a repair ship. His home port was Italy. How cool is that. When they weren't in port they mostly cruised the Mediterranean. If a ship broke they went to help fix it. I think the farthest they ever went was to the Azores. And as a machinist mate he had a career when he got out. Think about it.|`|7idyT7Obaa	for special forces its not what shape your in, its what you can tough out.<br>  if your looking for special operations:<br>  navy has BUDs, SEALs, and EOD<br>  Airforce has PJs Combat Controllers and EOD<br>  Marines have recon<br>  Army has rangers, sf, and the good ol' boys club<br>  if you want something that will more or less garuntee you to be in a good unit, do the army's 18X program. you go to basic, infantry school, airborne school, then you start the special forces process. if you fail out of that, they send you to the 82nd which is currently doing the Rangers' job in iraq.<br>  infantry in the marines would help you get to recon<br>  the airforce doesnt have any combat jobs except for the ones listed, the other closest thing they have is Security Forces (pretty much MPs) but all that they do is pull security on bases.<br>  not sure about navy, i know they dont ahve infantry though<br>  <br>  BTW: Special Forces are only in the army.|`|3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	If you're wanting to go SOF, you should definitely consider the Army. Look at the combat arms MOS's like Infantry, EOD, Combat Engineer. Also consider Combat Medic. All of those transition to SF fairly seamlessly, from what I recall. I can't offer much advice for the other branches.

K8qAniReaa	Boot Camp is not that hard.  Just keep a positive attitude and do what you're told, when you're told, how you're told and Boot Camp will be a cakewalk. <br>  <br>  I don't know how good "they" have made the benefits sound.  But they are pretty good.  You'll never have to deal with health insurance.  If you have any issues you just go to the hospital and get fixed up.  The military will pay for you to go to school or help you buy a house or help you start a business.  The pay is excellent compared to what you'll make as a teenager or in your 20's.<br>  <br>  Everyone in the military starts at the bottom.  But you won't be there for that long.  It only takes a couple of years to become an NCO.  When you do become an NCO you'll have your own sailors to command.  While you're not treated as great as you might be by your boss at McDonald's you're not going to get beat up or anything like that.  Young sailors at the bottom of the food chain are only treated bad when the mess up or need to get toughened up.  The higher up you get the more respect you've earned.<br>  <br>  <br>  As an enlisted sailor in the navy you will do four things.  The thing you trained for, cooking, standing watch, and cleaning.  You will clean a lot.  When you're at sea your ship is your home and it has to be kept looking nice.  Every sailor does a rotation in the mess on their first couple of sea tours.  And, the Navy always needs a few sailors to stand watch to make sure no one steals the ship :P<br>  <br>  Women in the Navy are treated better than Army or Marines.  There are more job opportunities in the navy than any other branch.  If you do your job well and always put forth 100% you'll be treated with a great deal of respect.|`|hDZ3FEjJaa	A lot of people regret joining the navy army, etc. Forget about being american, this country doesn't care about all the soldiers that have died in the war.

a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	Every set of military orders that are issued - "cut" is the military term - must assign you to a unit.  Since you're going to BMT and will eventually be assigned to a training squadron, the Air Force had to put you somewhere for accountability purposes. The 319th is a unit that is used, among other things, as an administrative "hold" squadron for new recruits who have not yet arrived at Lackland and been assigned to a training unit.  This is purely administrative; once you arrive at Lackland, you'll be assigned to your training unit then.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	It's at Lackland so what is the problem?

There was also a 319th Infantry Regiment in the 80th ID.<br>  <br>  SSG US Army 73-82<br>  <br>  Edit: Shoulda given you an example. Back in Dino Days when I got to Germany we were all assigned to the 21st Replacement Battalion. Once there they would match you up to a unit in need of your MOS and off you would go. Sounds like they are just using a similar concept.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	the 319th is a rehabilitation TRS. its for people that have medical problems or psychological problems afte they arrive at BMT. it is also for people who need to lose weight or gain weight.

The 737th and 319th have normal flight so dont be offended if they put you in the 319th but it is known to predominantly be a medical hold training squadron. my sister said that a few girls that sprained their ankles got sent to the 319th.|`|7idyT7Obaa	the 319th is in the 82nd, not 101|`|5xRY3uS7aa	I don't know what you mean, the 319th.

PCR is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA or RNA. Previously, amplification of DNA involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria, and took weeks. But now, with PCR done in test tubes, it takes only a few hours. PCR is highly efficient so that untold numbers of copies can be made of the DNA. Moreover, PCR uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying DNA:<br>  In the legal world is a hearing to establish possible DNA association in regarding the accuse and plantiff.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	You should know that I have a personal bias on this issue...I believe that abortion is child murder!  That said, the following is not based upon my opinion but of my understanding of American law!<br>  <br>  It depends upon how young you are.  If you are say 9 or 10, then yes, they can force you to have an abortion, depending upon the state.  Some states will not let a minor have an abortion without their written consent.  If you are say 14 or older, I strongly doubt that any state would permit you to have a forcible abortion but it could happen. In that case, you would have to seek out independent legal counsel and get a court's help.<br>  <br>  One last thing, I would be very careful of accepting any advice here as "law".  One poster said that it was an automatic emancipation if you got pregnant and that is definitely not true in the United States....no where in the U.S. is that the law!|`|3TdT5mG2aa	No, they cannot.<br>  <br>  If you wish to have a abortion you can but your parents or the doctor cannot force you to do anything.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	"No. It's your right to stay pregnant and have the baby, even if you're under 18 or not married.

Good question, I'll be watching this one.|`|KvE6eKWxaa	no, nor can they make you give up the baby for adoption.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	no, it's not like they can tie you down and call the doctor in.|`|1ss17pyzaa	no|`|ERCxeKhtaa	i dont think so....|`|Svo5Kqbyaa	No, a parent cannot force their child to have any medical procedure done that is optional. It isn't medically necessary for her to have an abortion, so a legal guardian cannot go against the wishes of the patient. She can guilt her into having one, but cannot physically force her. It is illegal for a doctor to perform the surgery if their patient has not consented. And I completely agree with you, I'm waiting until I'm married but i wondered that for a while so i did some research on it. Hope this helps.

318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	Who makes all the decisions about how the company is run?  How many people who "actually MAKE the goods and services" have the experience and knowledge necessary to make decisions regarding the management of multi-billion dollar enterprises?  It is a lot easier for someone in management to replace a line worker than for a line owrker to replace a member of management.  If an executive contracts with a company for a specific salary ($20M), then the money IS theirs.  Every other employee in the company has agreed to do a specific job for a specific reimbursement package.  How did you come to this magical number of $500K anyway?  Did your hero, Comrade Obama, say it?  What is so magical about it?<br>  <br>  Window, NO ONE has "stolen" $19.5 million from me.  If I agree to work for X dollars than that is what the job is agreed to be worth to me and my employer.  If I do more work, I will want to get paid more.  If a person doesn't like the compensation plan where they work, they can move along.  If enoough poeple move along, the compensation will change to suit the market.

There would be a shortage of people to be doctors because there isn't as much inscentive to go through 7-8 years of school.

629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	I don't know of any legitimate uses for "medical heroin." However, heroin is an opiate and there are certainly plenty of those to go around in the medical field, along with their addictions. Methadone is an opiate used to get people off heroin, but it creates an even worse problem in that it is more addicting and much harder to kick than the heroin itself.<br>  <br>  Medical marijuana is now legal in 14 states. Still against federal law, because federal government refuses to acknowledge that it has any medical purpose, despite a 5000 year history of safety and usefulness in many cultures around the world, including the US prior to it's being made illegal.  <br>  <br>  People make a "huge fuss over" MMJ because the same government that made it illegal has done their best for the past 70 years to make people believe the propaganda they put out about the drug. Those that believe it are convinced of it's harm, while those who have tried it know better. Meanwhile, government agencies continue to haunt us with tales of mental midgets and couch potatoes, while at the same time preventing any meaningful research into potential benefits of the drug. In many cases, marijuana IS the better alternative to opiates. Opiates can be prescribed by a doctor, and pharmaceutical companies continue to profit from them. Big pharma sees no profit in marijuana since it's a weed and anyone can grow it. Their job has become to support continued prohibition, meanwhile working on isolating various compounds from the plant. There have already been a number of patents applied for and/or issued for various cannabinoids. Marinol, a licensed FDA drug, is synthetic THC. It amazes me how they can call a synthetic version of a natural plant component a legal and effective remedy, but the plant itself remains illegal. <br>  It's a crazy world we live in, but more and more it seems marijuana is becoming more mainstream and I can only hope government comes to it's senses and repeals this prohibition.

uK4hyhe3aa	Most branches of the military are disproportionately minorities, and disproportionately people who come from lower class backgrounds.  They are probably not sickened when they see these racist rants, they are minorities and have dealt with racism and discrimination in one form or another their whole lives.  They're out there protecting a country that is their home, and the families, communities, and people important to them.  In the process, they're also protecting racist white folk that they probably wouldn't want to get to know.  They do it because it's their job and its admirable.<br>  <br>  An interesting sociological fact: the military may be on the best institution in terms of creating a racially equal environment.  Everyone starts at the same level and is dependent on each other equally.  In the military, you don't really have the opportunity to share your opinions (particularly racist ones), and its an institution that is truly based on merit, ability and interdependency.|`|AA11540967	There are no racist rants here on Y/A.

If we all wake up 4 years from now with jobs and money and health care, then he'll get re-elected without a problem. I think the plan is for the second term to be the more philosophical one where he addresses his moral stances.

I earn less than $250,000 per year (so even by Obama's definition, I am not considered rich), yet I would expect to pay approximately $3,500 more if Obama's proposals were applied to my 2008 federal income tax return.<br>  <br>  The federal tax rate increase is very real.|`|17b8f7a29f3e1e685bb47f0c628122a9aa	3% or 5% increase for "rich" -  does not make a blimp on 1,300,000,000,000 spending bill. We do not have enough "rich" people, we will have lower the tax definition of 'rich'. Question is: How low we will need to go? 200,000 or 150,000 or 100,000?<br>  <br>  Top 5% pay 53.25% of all income taxes.<br>  The top 10% pay 64.89% <br>  The top 25% pay 82.9%<br>  The top 50% pay 96.03% <br>  The bottom 50%?

Lets use an extreme like 20% to demonstrate this .. 20% of 250,000 is 50,000.

First I would like to state that my family makes no where near $250,000. <br>  <br>  People who have that money worked for it. There is no reason for them to be taxed to no end, and people who decide not to do anything with their life get a free ride (or close to it.)

I am  a nurse who care for terminally ill cancer patients most are elderly and can not afford the medicines to keep them either alive or comfortable through their disease... it is so sad....<br>  <br>  we are bailing out corporate American and bank and we have elderly who need help and children who go to bed hungry and millions going to bed under a bridge at night...<br>  <br>  And you are worrying about paying your taxes. Come on get real... You should be paying them gratefully knowing that if in this economy if you suddenly loose your job you have a government that can help you there will be programs that will keep you fed and sheltered. my only issue is all the money we send overseas that could be better used at home and money we are giving to bank that should just be given to americans and small business so we can return our towns and cities to places you could walk down the road on a thursday night and browse the shops of people who knew you and your family by name.. business who hired teenagers to work after school. where we had local bank relied on local credit  from them and big corporate American  did not rule the country and economic destiny in its hands.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Your parents came up with that idea when you were born.

I can only tell you if you think the military is all that life is made up of you really need to get out & live a life. No one can explain life to all you people who don't understand it. I suggest if you don't read books about life & you obvioiusly are not around people to teach you.

My Grandfather died during WWII.  She had no skills.  She worked for minimum wage (as did both her daughters) until she was 78.  She gets SS and some sort of payment as a death benefit for my Grandfather.  She was married til death.  That meant until HER death, too.  She is single.  She is 87.  She can't work.  And she can't afford her prescriptions.  So I support her.  My family supports her and she hates it but she has no choice.<br>  <br>  So you keep working hard and complaining about us giving away your money.  I will do the same.

The evil genius who came up with this would be the father of modern communism Karl Marx -- greatly admired by Obama and his party, by the way.  Obama's new term for it is "tax cuts" but giving tax money to people who didn't pay taxes in the first place isn't a "tax cut," it's still good old communist "re-distribution of wealth" in sheep's clothing.<br>  <br>  Hey Cut Throat B****:<br>  <br>  Did you know that most people collect far more in their lifetimes than they paid into the system?  All that extra Social Security money comes out of... oh wait... OTHER PEOPLE'S POCKETS, as in RE-DISTRIBUTED TAXES.<br>  <br>  Your family (or churches or other private charities) is SUPPOSED to support your grandmother... NOT the government, and most especially NOT ME.  You tell us all , if you can, why anybody outside your family is obligated to support YOUR grandmother.  I got a family to support too, you know.  The sinple fact that your grandmother has survived to a certain age does not entitle her or you, through socialist politicians YOU elect to government, to pick my pockets by proxy to support her.  If you think the government should support Grandma, then YOU can send Uncle Sam lots of EXTRA tax money, but keep your stinking paws out of MY pockets, you lousy mooch.<br>  <br>  I'm also not supposed to help pay for your kid's college or your family's health care, either.  That's YOUR responsibility, not mine, and at over $250K a year you can afford it a lot easier than I can.<br>  <br>  Maybe you don't care how much the government confiscates from you to support sick, lame and lazy strangers, but your apathy doesn't entitle you to drag the rest of us down into your I'm-too-stupid-to-care, spread-the-wealth socialist hell.<br>  <br>  This is why you never, ever vote for a Dumocrat or liberal for any office, at any level. Learn your lesson, America!<br>  <br>  The bank bailouts WERE welfare, and shouldn't have been allowed to happen, but I suppose somebody figured it was needed so that folks like your grandma wouldn't lose their houses and life savings.  The government nationalizing the banks should have pleased a casual communist like you, since you obviously think the government should be taking care of all our problems.<br>  <br>  So you earn over $250K but still evidently believe that other taxpayers like me should help you support your family.  You lousy sponge.<br>  <br>  celebrate, gwanotwozero, advice guru and mom:<br>  What entitles YOU (or your politicians) to reach into MY pockets to pay for YOUR opinions of "compassion?"  Compassion is voluntary; compulsory "compassion" is just confiscation and re-distribution of wealth.  YOU give more of your money to support government welfare if you choose; my choice will be to give more to private charities instead.  I bet you're all "pro-choice," but what about MY "freedom of choice" to dispose of MY earnings as I see fit?  What gives YOU the right to Ingringe MY "freedom of choice" NOT to give even more of MY money to an inefficient government to squander down a rathole of social entitlements that should never have been funded with government money in the first place???  Go be compassionate with your own money, not mine or someone else's.|`|KHSOVxViaa	I think it's called compassion.  It's part of what makes us human.<br>  <br>  If we stopped all public money for profoundly disabled people, I think we would become a much debased, certainly callous, and possibly cruel society.  I don't want my society to behave like that.  There is a level at which humans should help each other out; at our stage of development, that sometimes means via taxpayers' money.<br>  <br>  There will be others in society who cannot support themselves, such as those who have just lost a job, or are carers for others. I don't want such people to starve or die of exposure.  As such, I must be prepared to have society pay enough to avoid this.<br>  <br>  This is something different from society paying for lazy people to avoid work; a line should certainly be drawn somewhere so there is no incentive to become dependent for laziness or convenience.  Any payout of taxpayers' money should be based on need alone.<br>  <br>  A hard-working taxpayer should certainly expect to keep the larger part of his income, but taxation is needed to pay for society's non-profitable needs.  Defence, healthcare, police, infrastructure, etc.<br>  <br>  Helping the section of society who cannot support themselves should be part of that.  I don't want us to return to Dickensian times, when street urchins could die of starvation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  kilroy44:-<br>  It depends how you define rights, but normally these are rules we give ourselves as part of society, and are agreed on as a group for everyone in the group.<br>  <br>  In one sense, we have no absolute rights to anything, not to defence, police, roads, or even a state.<br>  <br>  However, we humans are social animals, and we organise ourselves in such ways as it is to our advantage.  It is commonly agreed that we help each other out in various ways.  Some of these things are regarded as important enough to be regarded as a 'right' or 'responsibility'; the modern way of deciding on these is through a common organising body, such as a country.<br>  <br>  Different countries and societies will come to different decisions, but it's notable that many countries come to very similar decisions about 'rights'.<br>  <br>  If you argue against any one of these, that is your opinion.  Other people will argue for these.  The decision is often arrived at using a democratic process, reflecting the general will of the people.  Hence a 'right' can apply to those who did not agree with it.  A country cannot have certain rights for some and not for others.<br>  <br>  Hence governments insist on having the legal right to take taxes from its citizens.  What these taxes are spent on is up to that particular government, but in a democracy it usually reflects the will or agreement of the people.  I don't know where you live, so I don't know my government has any right to your taxes.<br>  <br>  You 'bet' I'm 'pro-choice' - I'm not sure what you mean.  I'm for accountable democracy, where people can choose their government which sets the rules in a way that's acceptable to the majority.<br>  <br>  As a citizen of an accountable democracy, I argue my opinions as to what these rights might include, such as supporting those in genuine financial need.  I also have opinions about spending on defence, healthcare, streetlights, and many other things that taxes are spent on.  Here, I'm specifically answering the question about funding certain people who lack income.<br>  <br>  The right to take and spend taxes is not mine, it is my government's.  I live in an accountable democracy, so I must accept this principle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit2:<br>  kilroy44 :-<br>  I read that article, it's very insightful!  This is not exactly a surprise these days;  by now we're fairly familiar with the unprofessionalism of many banks in creating the bubble/burst and the failures of governing politicians to implement sufficient regulation to avoid it.<br>  <br>  I, for one, approve part of my taxes to be spent on efficient bodies that would enforce regulation to prevent such abuses by banks in the future.   I may even regard that as a right!  However, that's venturing off-topic for this question...|`|ebfcb66595e262dfada7dbf9f605f8dcaa	The government is out of control.

I am glad he taught is that if you use a credit card never charge more than you can afford to completely pay off at the end of the month when bill comes in. and never buy a car you can not afford to pay off in two years before it depreciates in value a lot. <br>  <br>  it is too bad other parents did not teach this and felt the need to spoil their kids and teach them it is more important to keep up with the jones than live within your means and save for the future. <br>  <br>  we have a goverment that is in crisis but it was George W. Bush who alone got us here and it is not something Obama is going to fix in two months... it will all get worse before it gets better we will see a great depression again as we aree already entering it with the loss of jobs families relying on food bank and assistance to survive. hopeful we now live in a world that will realize that obama will get the the job done if he gets the and cooperation and support he neess to get it done just like Roosevelt as long as he is allowed to remain in office long enough to accomplish it... <br>  <br>  Roosevelt if any of you recall was allow to remain in the white house from 1933 to 1945 because theyknew and acknowledged that changing leadership in a time of post war and a depressed economy would be detrimental to the grow and success of our country.  <br>  <br>  before you complain research the past and realize where we have come from and where the current president wants to take us and be realistic about how long it will take to get there  it took years to get in the situation we are in now... not going to fixed over night.

Joining the Armed Forces is a personal choice and as you yourself point out the Service is not for everyone.  I wouldn't dislike them at all.  As long as they respected me and my choices I would reciprocate and respect theirs.  My like or dislike of a person depends on the way they act and treat others including myself.  You respect me I respect you.  Simple as that.  Good luck to you.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope, <br>  <br>  My best friend never joined, he knew what he wanted to do, since he was in 10th grade.<br>  <br>  And he has done exactly what he said he wanted to.|`|014NXPfFaa	Freedom to choose what you want to do with your own life prevents me from hating pretty much anyone for their choices. <br>  <br>  I might not make the same choices as you but I wont dislike you for that...<br>  <br>  <br>  (BTW most people who join the military for money for college will tell you that's how they got motivated to join, but eight later they only have 30 credits!)|`|3caq6SFxaa	I would actually have no disdain for them but would for some one who joined the military solely to get the benefits.  Whether you feel a need to serve or not is something you feel and if you only want to "serve your country" for your personal gain I would rather not have you around me in combat.  You aren't serving your country but serving yourself and since you are the most important thing to you and I can't depend on you.|`|Gax0IIvOaa	Only when I hear them ***** about veteran preference points or something like that.<br>  I feel that my service was an obligation of the freedom that I was born into..  I never had a doubt that I would go into the service after high school only which branch.  When I met someone I try to get an idea on, if they served or not.  I can usually tell, and I can sometimes figure out what branch they were in without asking.  I don't think less of them if they didn't unless I hear them whine about the cost of defense or how they think servicemen are poor dumb asses who can't find a real job.  Like most vets I feel its was there choice and I'm proud I was part of their freedom to choose.|`|otYOxmnuaa	All of the soldiers of the past assured that any American had that choice.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately -- some of the chicken-hawks in Congress make the reality of war real...and that turns people off - especially if the war is unwarranted.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Not at all. Military service isn't for everyone, and I want everyone who does enlist to do so without mental reservation or doubts.|`|3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	Not in the slightest. I have no qualms with anyone that doesn't want to join the military. All of us that are in it realize that it's a sacrifice (or at least should). <br>  <br>  No one should be disliked just because they don't want to be in the military, at least not in America. <br>  <br>  The only reason I have for disliking anyone that's not in the military is if they're too ignorant to realize what it is we do and call us murderers. But, I'll still defend their right to be idiots.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	Whether a person decides to join the military or not, it is a personal choice. The military isn't for everyone.<br>  <br>  I would respect someone more for knowing this ahead of time and not joining in the first place rather than the person who joins then hates it and cries to get out.<br>  <br>  I was in the military and I do have a special place in my heart for my fellow service men and women/veterans. I feel a sense of kinship that I don't feel with someone who hasn't served. Even so I don't think nothing bad about people who don't serve. It is their choice and they have to do what they feel is right for them.<br>  <br>  As long as someone is not disrespectful and doesn't criticize the military then I don't feel any resentment or disdain for them. I just dislike people who bad mouth the military who was never in it.|`|GsSRY7quaa	the military life is not for everyone. too many people who join, join for the wrong reasons. the military is a fighting group first. most who join think it is just a different type of job and never believe that they will have to fight. so, if you don't join for any particular reason, it's not a problem. my dad, 2 brothers and son were /are in the service, though it was not for me.
q3Vo1s2caa	Yes, that's correct and no one will ever give Bush credit for taking out that rattle snake Saddam and giving the people of Iraq a chance at a functioning country. Just like they try and diminish Reagan defeating the USSR - historical revisionism.|`|jWO10NN5aa	The Iraq war was a big mistake and totally uncalled for.  Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction, was not an enemy of the US, and was not even thinking about nuclear weapons on the eve of Bush's stupid invasion.  What Saddam Hussein WAS thinking about on the eve of the invasion was the writing his fourth pulp fiction novel "Get Out, You Damned One", about a greedy schemer plotting to overthrow the sheik of a powerful enemy willing to exterminate all Arabs.  Hussein was more concerned about his novel than about any of George Bush's lunacy.<br>  <br>  Having said that, Obama cannot even allude to victory, because there was no victory to be had in the first place.  ALL of the fighting that ensued was because of the American occupation and destruction in Iraq, not at all about any terrorism or anything else.  Obama can not declare victory except perhaps a victory over a very bad error in judgment on the part of George Bush, and he need only get the troops out of Iraq to do that.<br>  <br>  Bush's legacy is one of lies, deceit, and deception.  He is a criminal who should be prosecuted for murder and treason.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Correct. And there can be no "validation" or justification for invading a country that did not attack us and had nothing to do with those who did.

AA11702773	Absolutely the government EXISTS to protect our persons and our property rights, including from fraud and theft.  We are libertarian, not anarchists.<br>  <br>  However, most of that should be at the state level.  Sound money, no fraud in international dealings, no counterfeiting, and a strong military for defense, as well as a post office, that is federal, and to intervene in interstate disputes via the Supreme Court.  Fraud is a state law function, generally.  The government governs best that governs least, and individuals are better represented locally, where they and not only special interests can have an impact on policy.<br>  <br>  And as for our legal system, our Constitution is fine, but the idea that it is a living document and hence might as well be blank, is not.

So we now have the Federal govt owning a private business and competing with other private businesses. That sounds like a disaster.|`|mEZpqzkMaa	Absolutely not. I don't think they should own 1%. The government is making moves toward nationalization of the banks, which is dangerous to all of us. Can you imagine one day that some washington lackey decides who can get a loan and who can't. What makes anyone think that the government can help run a bank? The government has a poor performance track record. They can't stay on budget they are steeped in bureaucracy, and have managed to foul up most of the programs they oversee. The private sector would have made the adjustments necessary to improve banking, but for some reason the government falsely thinks they can do better. I say good luck. Poor companies deserve to die, if citi can't hack it they should be bought out by companies that can, not government. Furthermore the auto industry should be left to their own devices. The American auto industries should conglomerate, streamline, and change direction or die.|`|318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	NO!

2a7d9badd96c9006c7c73cf7b3fe1775aa	man, i'm telling you. Despite the actions of some - who go against the teachings of Islam - Islam is a religion of peace; the word "islam" means "peace through submission to God." "Muslim" means "one who submits to God." Islam is the third of the three Abrahamic faiths, and it shares much with Judaism in Christianity; its differences are the acceptance of Muhammad as the last and final prophet, and the oneness of God - in other words, that Jesus, though he was a revered prophet, was not in fact God, and only one God exists. Apparently the Taliban could not read (though their name means "students"), because the Qur'an states that men and women are equal as believers, and that all believers should be educated and seek knowledge. Modesty in dress and behavior is required in Islam for both men and women to preserve the values of society and move the emphasis from superificial appearance to intelligence, knowledge, and God.|`|62da716358367ad712154cbc15052a50aa	How many muslims you seen speaking out about the atrocities their fellow religious order followers are committing?<br>  <br>  nuff said .......|`|32cf3a60c98214ed481bdbce6693c5a8aa	In India, Hindus believe in world peace and our religion does not speak of any violence.

Beware of the man who speaketh with forked tongue, could this be Eric Holder?|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	They must want a civil war on US soil, because that will be the direct result of any attempt to disarm Americans.<br>  <br>  Some of these bleating sheep ask: "derrrr..... why do you need assault weapons?" <br>  <br>  This is the very reason! To defend ourselves against a government gone bad. <br>  <br>  Which it HAS.<br>  <br>  Any government that wants to disarm its people... is the enemy of its people.<br>  <br>  Americans need assault weapons now, perhaps more than ever before. Hell, we need some TANKS!! I would feel a lot safer if each state had its own Civilian Tank Platoon.<br>  <br>  The Founders intended the populace to be as sufficiently armed OR BETTER than the national military, as the last line of defense against tyranny. And they knew a thing or two about tyranny.<br>  <br>  I might add..... the first gun restrictions in the US were enacted against Native Americans and African slaves. Hitler did it too. It's the first order of business when attempting to suppress, control, or exterminate a population.<br>  <br>  A government should fear its people.<br>  <br>  FURTHERMORE, if you're concerned about CRIME, you should take it upon yourself to arm up and learn how to defend yourself! Because if you expect the police to magically show up and save you when things get really bad, well.... you probably deserve what you'll get. <br>  <br>  If you can't protect yourself, then you become TOTALLY dependent on the state for your protection, which is precisely what the state wants.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cities with gun bans or oppressive licensing systems that refuse to issue CCW permits to law abiding citizens have enormous violent crime rates compared to places that allow their citizens to protect themselves. This is an indisputable fact.<br>  <br>  <br>  I can't believe this is even being debated. I am amazed at how gelded some of you have allowed yourselves to become.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	Actually you are wrong about that being the only way, they have a backup plan to have gun stores and such record every box of ammo that you buy and have them do enough paperwork to slow down the process enough to make them want to quit stocking it . They figure no ammo , no guns . If they only knew , if we , the public , have no guns then only criminals will have guns, and they will have the amo to go with it|`|uK4hyhe3aa	I don't think guns are ever going to be banned in America, not in these days anyways.  I'm a liberal and a democrat, but I'm cool with guns.  I like them, but I think everybody who owns a gun or has easy access to a gun should know how and when to use it.  A gun in the hands of a person who is stupid, insane, or impaired is NEVER a smart idea.  <br>  <br>  Making guns illegal would be a pretty stupid idea just because it would drive up a black market for them, which I feel could result in more crime and gun-related deaths.  The sad thing is, you can't tell who is going to use a gun for good and who is going to use a gun for bad when you sell it to somebody.  Checks and clearances are hindrances for bad people in getting guns, but definitely doesn't stop them from doing it.<br>  <br>  If someone is willing to shoot a crowd of people at a school or a shopping mall, they are definitely insane, but they will get their gun one way or another.  It's one reason I think people should be allowed to have guns, to protect themselves from the real crazies, but I think breeding a more tolerant and compassionate society that can try and stop people before they get to the level of killing people is the best way at it.<br>  <br>  It's a very difficult political situation.  The personal and public safety argument works for both sides of the issue.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT IS RUN BY TRAITOROUS CRIMINALS AND HAS BEEN FOR DECADES.<br>  THEY ARE CALLED NEOLIBERAL GLOBALISTS,<br>  <br>  THEY WANT NATIONALIZED BANKS (that's why they imploded our economy), THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS (they got that), THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR GUNS.  <br>  They don't want us to be able to defend ourselves from the flash mobs and desperate people who will be soon starving in this country as year after year we never get out of this "depression", no jobs, no money, no food.|`|NktvqJhlaa	Question: How many illegal aliens are buying weapons here and selling them back in mexico?

It banned legitimate home defense weapons and sporting arms that vaguly LOOKED like military weapons in some cases.<br>  <br>  If you change the definition of words, you can make the sheep do whatever you want them to do, I guess.<br>  <br>  Join the NRA. Write letters to your congressmen. Get involved because the last line of defense for the bill of rights IS the Second Amendment.

Here is your source<br>  <br>  And it is not up to liberals to define my "needs" "wants" or "ability to pay"<br>  <br>  And while we are on the subject: Last June in the Supreme Court decision that overturned the illegal and unconstitutional DC handgun ban the Court held that the 2nd amendment protects the right of INDIVIDUALS (not millitia members) to possess handguns for SELF DEFENSE purposes.<br>  <br>  It also held that the guarantee applies to weapons in common use at the time such as semiautomatic rifles.  The Court also dispensed with inane arguments about rocket launchers and nukes by spelling out that unusual weapons can be banned.  But not rifles, pistols, shotguns nor revolvers.|`|XU5SVQZDaa	In you dreams they are 'for' us.

Andrew Jackson when they put small pox in the Cherokee Indians blankets to get rid of them all. They wanted their land and their gold. Bush tried to take all Native Americans benefits away-breaking all treaties-the dems stopped them. Times have not changed. Expect the worse and plan-then, don't be surprised at anything they try to do to us. We lose-politicians win.|`|HkwVevGcaa	Each person has a right under the 2nd amendment to keep and bear arms however it is important that guns remain out of the hands of criminals and that is why everyone needs to go through a process to get a basic handgun.  Assault weapons are used only for mass murder in cases of war, and we do not have a major threat on our soil|`|6dSRjda6aa	It is not going to pass through because a lot of the government is people that hunt and it would have to go through all three branches of government to pass.

He sent Eric "Coward Man" Holder down there to analyze the situation and the result was a gun ban in the US. He said that weapons are coming from the US. I'm sure that Mexicans are blocking the importation of weapons from such other countries as Venezuela etc since Chavez just left Mexico supporting an individual running for president who is a drug smuggler.

Atras quedo el bombardeo al Kadafi subversivo, ahora se busca la modernidad de Libia. El factor petroleo pesa, y Kadafi busca convertir a Libia en una suerte de Dubai o de Arabia Saudita aprovechando su carta energética (también cuenta con grandes reservas de gas natural). Definitivamente Libia es distinto a Iran, ya que el primero busca el liderazgo del magreb de la mano de Francia, mientras que Iran quiere ser el hegemón de oriente medio y ponerse al tu por tu con los pesos pesados de la geopolitica mundial|`|28abc5500d577dbf18d1881039481f9eaa	No lo creo debido a que el loco de Bush, no tiene el apoyo de el Senado dominado por el partido democrata.

Esto permitió al gobierno de Gadaffi alcanzar acuerdos de inversión con la Unión Europea que le son muy beneficiosos y en donde las empresas petroleras están insertas.<br>  <br>  El caso de Irán es mucho más complicado, mientras que el iraquí... bueno... el iraquí ha sido una tremenda estupidez norteamericana.<br>  <br>  El asunto de Somalía no tiene nada que ver con el petróleo, si lo que dicen es por la película "Blackhawk down", les recomiendo que busquen información sobre la situación de Somalia en esa época y el porqué de la presencia militar en ese país (Operación "Restore Hope", bajo mandato de la ONU). Si es por los sucesos recientes (tropas etiopes y somalíes invandiendo Somalia para derrocar a los se?ores de la guerra en el poder, con apoyo norteamericano) también les recomiendo que investiguen.<br>  <br>  En cuanto al ataque de USA contra Libia, éste se produjo en 1986 por varios motivos. El primero de ellos es que se comprobó que Libia había sembrado minas marinas en el Canal de Suez y el Mar Rojo, produciendo el hundimiento de entre 4 y 18 barcos mercantes. También se corroboró que Libia estaba financiando acciones terroristas en varios países del mundo (en 1988 sus servicios de inteligencia destruyeron un Boeing 747 en el aeropuerto de Lockerbile, matando a más de 240 pasajeros).<br>  <br>  USA patrullaba la zona ese a?o para vigilar a Libia, Gadafi informó que USA estaba violando la soberanía en el Golfo de Sidra (que no es reconocido mundialmente como libio) y despachó, en dos oportunidades, cazas MiG-23ML y Su-22M2 contra el portaaviones norteamericano de turno. En las dos oportunidades (distintas) los yanquis derribaron dos cazas de cada tipo. Ese mismo a?o, dos corbetas lanzamisiles libias intentaron lanzar misiles contra los portaaviones norteamericanos, los gringos respondieron y hundieron dos buques del tipo "Nanuchka" libios...<br>  <br>  En esos ataques, más allá de la arrogancia norteamericana, la posición geográfica de los combates y las advertencias libias dejaron claramente a Libia como país agresor. Cuando se corroboró lo de los atentados y el minado que mencioné más arriba, USA lanzó un ataque aéreo sobre Libia, en donde empleó bombarderos tácticos F-111 "Aadvark", de los que al menos dos resultaron derribados.|`|t7Vw9ZJ3aa	en el corto plazo  no.

De ahí que tenga qué adoptar medidas como las  adoptadas por el Che Guevara en Cuba, cuando EUA trató de desestabilizar al gobierno cubano de Fidel Castro (recordemos que esto generó la crisis del caribe en 1962, con la colocación de misiles nucleares en laisla de cuba, apuntando hacia territorio de EUA.)<br>  <br>  Entonces a mi parecer Venezuela está tecnológicamente hablando, muy bien preparado para un conflicto, aun con los EUA, pues si bien la tecnología estadounidense es muy superior, los venezolanos están adquiriendo armas de vanguardia, como aviones y un ejemplo es la adquisición de aviones Mig 29 Fulkrum de exfabricación soviética, los cuales, se dice, son superiores a los F-14, F-15 y F16 estadounidenses, y la adquisición de esos aviones, ha puesto en alerta al gobierno gringo, quien ha reprochado enormemente a los rusos la venta de esas aeronaves al gobierno de Hugo Chavez. Y vaya que no compraron poquitos.<br>  <br>  Pero también los brasile?os tiene tecnología militar de exportación y aunque no cuentan con un ejército preparado en la práctica de guerra, pueden apoyar a cualquier nación latinoamericana con armamento. <br>  <br>  Por último los argentinos y los colombianos sí han participado en guerras, tanto formales como informales (guerra de guerrillas) y por ello sus soldados están mejor entrenados en batalla que el resto de los latinos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Me imagino que, ojalá nunca ocurra, si hubiera un conflicto bélico en América, sería entre los países del cono sur, PROPICIADO POR ESTADOS UNIDOS, pero conforntando por ejemplo a Chile, Colombia o a Uruguay contra Brasil, Argentina o Venezuela, que ya se han salido de su esfera de influencia económica y son un "peligro" para las "democracias" latinoamericanas.<br>  <br>  De México no sé qué decir, pero algo es cierto, se han comprado helicopteros rusos, fraceses, estadounidenses pero ya obsoletos para una guerra moderna.<br>  <br>  De hecho, hace como ocho a?os, en un desfile del 16 de septiembre, los muy pen..dejos militares destruyeron en un accidente, varios aviones ??F-5!!, aviones de los a?os 60′s, lo que demuestra que absolutamente nada tedríamos qué hacer contra ningún país invasor,a menos que se tratara de algún centroamericano y aun así nos veríamos en dificultades.<br>  <br>  Que la boca se me haga chicharrón y eso no ocurra nunca.|`|6De5fAydaa	Chile es el único país en condiciones para hacerlo,por tener esas tres importantísimas condiciones|`|6a3b63ff1bba6e19954adaae48323797aa	Pues si la guerra fuera con Estados Unidos..ninguno ganaría!

The footage that you see of combat comes either from civilian sources, or Combat Camera units (Such as the 55th Combat Camera, also stationed at Fort Meade). Each branch of the military has their own combat documentation assets, which embed with Infantry units, document their missions, and send the imagery to the JCCC (Joint Combat Camera Center).<br>  <br>  The cameras used are purchased by the units. At 55th, we use Sony PD-170's and Nikon D2X's. :)<br>  <br>  If you're asking about the "some kind of cam on their head", those are actually nightvision goggles or headlamps.|`|6PBGAp7Raa	you're probably thinking of the infared night vision goggles that are attatced to the hemelts. those aren't cameras. they are so our Marines can see at night without the use of visible light that can be seen by the enemy.|`|7idyT7Obaa	i know some dudes that got sport cameras and mounted them on their helmets<br>  just search under "sport camera" or "helmet camera" on ebay. they're tube shaped.|`|wzwUcjvhaa	Those are not cameras|`|014NXPfFaa	it's a light, it's called a headlamp or a headlight, probably other names too.|`|ooopNW0oaa	Here's one>>> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buDDqa0Mgr4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buDDqa0Mg...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geckoheadgear.com/emergencyservices/comms" rel="nofollow">http://www.geckoheadgear.com/emergencyse...</a>
3caq6SFxaa	Standard combat load for the M-16 was 300 rounds now (used to be 200 but 30 round magazines now).  How many you carry is usually more then that and as many as you can.  The most important thing to carry is what you might need the most so should I take my video camera or more ammo should be an easy answer-more ammo.  In Vietnam carried usually at least double that plus extra for the machine gunner.  No SAW then so the machine gun would be M-60 and if we went out with one everyone carried some ammo for it just to be sure he didn't run out.  I would say the first answer (three magazines) must be referring to the pistol carried as a secondary arm.  Actually you really carry what yu need plus extra just in case-going a mile down the road to look at something you would not carry the same as going out for a couple of days.|`|4u06TaSNaa	marines take what they need most of time its 3 magazines counting one in there rifle|`|k76mr7rKaa	Depends what the mission is, and what weapon is assigned to you. <br>  <br>  Example: M4,M16, 249, 240G etc.|`|3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	Not sure about how much the marines take, and I'd really rather not comment on how much the Army takes.

If he wants visitation and/or custody, he will have to file for that himself--it's like a whole other action, but before the same judge.  Wait and see what he does.  He may not even file an Answer and they will get a Default Judgment against him for you and the rest will be a non issue.  In any event--I can;t see the Court giving him custody.

I know that when my friends ex husband wanted to sue for custody to avoid paying $800.00 a month for 3 kids, my friend went to court and showed the Judge his arrest papers and probation violation papers for testing dirty for various drugs, dealing and stealing, etc., The Judge wouldn't even let him has visitation until he proved that he could stay clean for 1 month-testing (drug) twice a week. he was unable to stay clean and therefore never got visitation. Visitation is separate from child support. They will not deny a child the right to see a mother or father just because they haven't paid child support.|`|c287f173b8fb7ff7e80ccf004e401288aa	courts are supposed to determine who would be the better parent for the child, and decide custody primarily on that issue.<br>  <br>  however, in the reality to today, the only way a mother will lose custody is if she agrees to give up custody or is putting the child in immediate danger, is abusing the child, or is otherwise being an unfit parent.<br>  <br>  so as long as you have been, and continue to be, a well-rounded, fit parent, there is almost no chance a father could do anything to win custody.

If you're in for 3 years and then go to BMTS for 3 years, you'll separate from the service when your normal enlistment runs out at Lackland.  However, if you don't have enough time left on your enlistment when you apply for a special duty assignment, you'll be required to extend your enlistment as long as is needed to complete the assignment.|`|acrnYYweaa	i had to take a test at my recruiters office for special duty assignments. but i think you might have to wait the 6 years.|`|QzN4MhRqaa	Yes, your time will count toward your 6 yr. enlistment.  MTI duty is normally a 2 yr. tour, but depending upon the availability of personnel it might be 3 yrs.  Should you decide to reenlist, they might put you back in your original AFSC if it is critically undermanned or allow you to cross train in another AFSC.

The statistics are not, however broken down by the drugs, as there is usually more than one involved.  Even in the case of alcohol related problems it is more than just alcohol that breaks up a marriage.  There are quite a few cases of people being beaten or abused by partners that were high.  Anything that lowers inhibitions can be part of the cause for violence, car crashes, boating accidents and unplanned sexual intercourse.  While a date rape drug is not usually "slipped" into ones joint, the same joint can help loosen ones inhibitions enough to get one into bed.<br>  A crutch is a crutch, legal or not, so is a drug.

When your high off weed, you will go in a corner and just sit or be real laid back. Now if your high on cocaine or meth or heroine, then your mood becomes dangerous, and people's safety could be threatened. How do i know this? Because i've been around alcoholics, potheads, crackheads, heroine addicts, and meth addicts. I feel safer around potheads, because their not strung out, and they don't act bipolar like the other ones. People need to lighten up a bit.|`|nRaHwEmMaa	"Weed" has some more severe long-lasting health hazards then that of Alcohol, and because it has only recently (past 80 or so years) become a more commonly used plant, compared to alcohol which has been used since the dark ages, it can't be trusted yet to be completely legalized like that of alcohol.<br>  <br>  Apparently, Weed can have similair health complications associated with the lungs as tobacco, so in a way your getting double-whammied.<br>  <br>  The same site also states that it can cause damage to the emotional portions of the brain in a long-lasting effect, causing emotional instability when not under the effects of smoking weed. It is also associated with memory problems and damage to the nuerons of the brain.<br>  <br>  Marijuana can also cause tiredness, depression, paranoia, anxiety, laryngitis and bronchitis and the risk of heart attack when smoking marijuana is quadrupled (X4).<br>  <br>  If the users know the risks however, and still choose to use the plant (much like the generals warning on a pack of cigarettes) then they should be permitted to use marijuana.

TT0rCi8kaa	The US`constitution, while an admirable Document (in its original form), has been "Violated" so many times, with ammendments, that all it really does these days, is serves as a reminder of how the best of intentions, can be hijacked, and used to dupe a whole population, into believing they have certain inalienable rights, which is clearly, not the case. There can be no freedom, while an exploitative Government spends so much time and effort disenfranchising large sections of it's population, with a never ending barrage of new "Laws", the Cannabis ones in particular. Not only have these Laws been rigorously enforced, they only penalise the "Victims" of the so called crime. They were originally introduced, to protect people from the "evils of drugs" , and when these laws were found to be unworkable, the Law turned on the Victims, and users of drugs, and locked them up instead of the big businesses that really benefit from the illicit drugs trade.<br>  When will People wake up and realise, that Governments, far from having the interests of its People at heart, are actually destructive, and exploitative tools of the unscrupulous, and are used to effect a "no dissent" Policy, that allows them to operate with impunity?|`|NG6eeCfuaa	It's because of the THC. It's sister plant, hemp, is legal. Hemp was used prevalently when the constitution was written for ship sails (among varieties of other things). However, the sister Cannabis plant contains THC (really the only thing that separates the two), which makes Marijuana an illegal drug.

The government does not have to have a reason enumerated in the Constitution to pass a law|`|eW7oeFuKaa	I know you want someone to tell you why it's constitutional to outlaw it, but it simply isn't constitutional and you won't get that answer. Smoking (whether marijuana or cigarettes) is an issue of morality. Someone can say it is moral to smoke just as much as someone can say it's immoral. Simply, morality can't and shouldn't be legislated. You have the constitutional right to ingest whatever the hell you want as long as you are not infringing upon the rights of others. Smoking marijuana doesn't infringe upon the rights of others and does very little harm to the smoker. It's just a plant, plain and simple. There are always the politicians who will rant that it's extremely addictive, kills brain cells, causes lung cancer, etc, etc. If this is true, why am I still alive and why am I an intelligent and productive member of society? Many people will argue that we don't need another legal substance that can be abused. But the fact of the matter is that there are always going to be abusers. People abuse alcohol, people abuse welfare, and people abuse cheeseburgers, but the majority is responsible and the same follows with marijuana. The question we should really be asking ourselves is, "Why do we feed society tobacco grown with radioactive fertilizer that kills 400,000 people a year?"<br>  <br>  Marijuana is a misunderstood plant; I recommend everyone watch this video. It's a Canadian documentary that is very informative and extremely entertaining.

BUT if you keep the money and you know she needs or wants the change back and you don't give it to her, it is stealing from your own Mother.  Why don't you just ask her.   Mom can I keep the change ?    I bet she would say yes, unless she is hard up and needs the three dollars.   You need to develop the habit of giving back the change to anyone.    When your Grandmother gives you money for shopping for her and you do not offer the change back then YES, you are stealing.    Don't ever do that to a friend.  Be Honest and Always give the change back.  Then who ever gets the change, they can say to you.

yQ0OzEbZaa	Quit Whining: Bush inheirted a recession from Clinton also and didn't cry about it over and over and over again. This is now the Obama recession. Cut the hero worship.  <br>  <br>  The Obama hysteria is not merely embarrassing to witness, it is itself contributory to the scale of the disaster that is coming. The desperate suspension of disbelief by people of intelligence in a pathetic effort to hypnotise themselves into the delusion that it will be all right. Not all change is good. <br>  <br>  We've GOT to act. NOW! There's NO TIME for debate. We're on the PRECIPICE. We're staring into the ABYSS. The government has to spend BIG and it has to spend FAST, before it's TOO LATE! <br>  When Joe Biden said during the campaign that President Barack Obama was going to face a crisis right out of the gate, it wasn't a wild guess. He was stating half of the elemental strategy of the Obama administration: Have a crisis.<br>  <br>  Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, gave us the other half of the administration's strategy soon after the election in a talk with Wall Street Journal staffers: "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before."<br>  <br>  So, have a crisis and use it to get things you want that you couldn't have gotten from people who weren't frightened.

They feel like fools & feel so inferior they hate to be around dems. They wouldn't know how to be around dems.They see dems as mature, decent, educated, wealthy without the greed, spiritual, peaceful, etc. everything they have never been exposed to in thier who life. ..I suggest you feel good not sick of them but healthy because we get more of what we put our attention into. They are in such a minority now. The most accurate pollsters show them at about 11% of the country while 85% supports Obama. If we stay focused on the high road the rest will have to follow or they will get out of the political race all together. They are humiliated right now. So ignore them & they will stop whining or they can keep whinning but it will start manifesting as depreciation on themselves.

Obama and the Dems completely own it. If it doesn't work (and it won't) like the Republicans said it wouldn't, then they are the ones to blame. The Republicans put forth stimulus bills of their own, but being the minority party, they were killed in committee.<br>  <br>  When this crisis hit, Congress was controlled by the Dems and the GOP could not get their fixes in.<br>  <br>  The Republicans were hoping Obama would work with them, but all they got was a "I won" (i.e. "kiss my black azz") . Obama hasn't even made a decent pretense of bipartisanship. And he showed his lack of class when he took cheap pot-shots at Bush in his inaugural speech.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but he's reached his level of incompetence. He's been able to skate by in his previous jobs because he never had to actually be responsible for accomplishing anything or making any hard decisions. Now, the buck stops with him and he can't pass it or vote "present", and he's screwing it up. <br>  <br>  Thanks for voting in this inexperienced prima donna.

You can't watch Obama operate without concluding he truly believes that government, not the private sector, generates wealth in this nation. <br>  <br>  --Be the arbiter of income distribution for all citizens. <br>  <br>  --Impose paralyzing cap and trade mandates on private corporations based on dubious, disputed, non-consensus-based "science," which amounts to nothing more than another tax on private industry and flies directly in the face of Obama's promises to be friendly to small business.|`|9dEotvVwaa	You should check your statistics.  Check out the link below from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  95% of the historical high unemployment rates for all states hit their record highs in the middle to late 70's (Carter years) into the early 80's (Regan early years).  So what this tells me is that Carter ruined the economy during his term which lasted for the first couple of years of the Regan Administration.  Only one state (Rhode Island) hit a historical high in Dec 2008.  <br>  <br>  Also, the recession didn't begin until the last two years of the Bush administration which is when the democrats reached a majority in the house and senate.<br>  <br>  This tells me that the Democrats are the ones who ruined the economy|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	I think some of these Americans are a hazard UNTO themselves frankly.<br>  <br>  They'd rather have the days of BUSH and living in fear having the world hating them back.

It doesn't work.  My fear is that this spending will bring on an even worse depression than the first one.

Obama's stimulus package is nothing more than a give than take package. at the end of Bush's term, he had to attempt to appease the left with poorly written bailout plans. Most republicans were against those bills as written as well. Bush did not fail, because his bills did not have time to work before Obama decided to change them. Things were actually beginning to improve before he was elected and Wall Street decided to get scared again. This package will not accomplish much for this nation. Government spending on a major level will not increase customer confidence.|`|C2HHfun2aa	Now you know how we felt listening to you guy whine for 8 long years! You weren't willing to give Bush a break on anything so why should we give Obama a break?<br>  <br>  You are seriously mis-informed this isn't the worse economic crisis since the depression and it also isn't the highest unemployment rate since the depression but this is almost as bad as the one during the Carter administration. By the way Obama's policies are almost exactly the same as Carter's so we already have a good idea of what is going to happen. The unemployment rate during the Depression was over 20% and during the Carter administration it was 12% and just today the unemplyment rate is 10%.<br>  <br>  I find it laughable that Obama and you Obamunists are whining about the deficit and the recession. Have you forgotten that the Democrats have been in control of both houses for the last two years and that Obama was a Senator for the last two years? Have you forgotten that Obama and the Democrats voted for everyone of Bush's spending bills and in most cases wanted to spend more?<br>  <br>  Do you realize that in under 2 months Obama has spent $2 trillion in deficit spending which is more than the entire Iraq has costed so far?<br>  <br>  Do you really want to know who is responsible for the current economic crisis?!

So how do you think thats going to turn out?<br>  <br>  "Why are we in the worst economic crisis since the depression?"<br>  <br>  We're not. Its how Obama is handling it will put us in an economic crisis that was bad as the depression.<br>  <br>  "The unemployment rate is at it's highest also since the depression"<br>  <br>  Thats false. <br>  <br>  "and yet Republicans has the nerve to under mine Obama's Stimuls package."<br>  <br>  Its our constitutional right to do so. Just because Obama says that the answer to our problems is in his stimulus package, doesnt mean that its so.<br>  <br>  "If you have all the right answers why then didnt Bush do anything about it?"<br>  <br>  Because Bush didnt enact our right answers.

But, I think the markets are a good reflection as to how America feels about Barack Obama's stimulus package. All these people who voted for him thinking he would be the great savior have been duped. Barack has even fooled himself into thinking he would be the next greatest president with his arrogant and cocky demeanor. He is inexperienced and has no clue. That is why he surrounds himself with seasoned and experienced politicians. He truly will be a one term prez and will leave this country in a much worse state than Bush did. I shudder to think of what other horrible things may happen with him as prez. <br>  Please note: It has nothing to do with him being bi-racial.|`|RPeeNMy2aa	For the same reason the Dems did not give Bush or any other Republican a break. They only serve the party not the people.<br>  <br>  To be fair. Bush was not that good of  President and Obama's stimulus will do nothing to improve the economy at the very best. The issue with the economy is the price of goods has vastly outpaced the average wage in America. The is only two ways to fix it, raise everyones pay damaticly or lower the cost of goods. Since they are not giving anyone a raise the price of goods will come down. However thanks to the stimulus it will keep the price high. Obamas hope is that the stimulus will jog the economy to 2003 levels and produce huge tax revenue before the stimulus runs out and the economy bombs out again. Ths process will take about 3 years, just enough tme to have the economy stabilize and for him to get re-elected. The economy will then falter even worse, but he will be in office for his second term so it will not matter. Do not feel bad though the Republicans would have done the same thing if they had power, it would jut be different Special interests getting the money.|`|c85WWXV7aa	Trying to answer this from a neutral stand point. Most of us know how this economy really works. And know that you cannot borrow money you have no way of paying back. Yet that is exactly what just happened. The money was borrowed from the Federal Reserve.  People don't know this but, the Federal Reserve is just a bank. It is not, and never was apart of the government. So basically this is just what happened. we took out a loan from a bank with no real means of paying it back. When it comes time for that loan to be repaid we have one of two choices. 1. take out a larger loan to cover the interest and principal of the original loan. or 2. raise taxes on the citizens to pay back the interest on the loan and get an extension on the loan.

DgfEkFGLaa	Boxer and Fienstien. I did email my Senators and asked them to vote NO to the TARP bill and was ignored. The Senate said that the 3 page bill passed by the house was a blank check to Wall Street and that they were going to add over sight. They added 140 pages of earmarks and NO oversight at all. I told them not to expect my vote in 2010 so I am holding them accountable. To add insult to injury they closed their session knowing that there was an automatic pay raise in place for them. They could have rejected that pay raise, but they did not. That is on Both of the super parties, there is no denying it. In 2010 I want to see all those self serving lifers out of power.

He was the congressional representative of Congress for that district. He WAS IN THE AREA in the days immediately after Katrina. Right now other people are trying to get in touch with Garland Robinette, a popular radio show host and former TV anchor, to find out if he manged to contact Jindal in the days right after Katrina. I think I actually remember  hearing Jindal on "The Think Tank" in the weeks after Katrina. WWL radio NEVER went of the air during Katrina.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0209/Jindal_aide_Story_was_set_after_Katrina.html?showall" rel="nofollow">http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0...</a>|`|St5xkCTraa	No, Jindal did not lie. Listen carefully to what he said in the link that you nicely provided. He opened his discussion of Katrina by saying, "Let me tell you a story." Please note that he did not say, "Let me tell you what happened during the Katrina crisis."<br>  <br>  There is a big difference between a "story," which is what Jindal described what he was doing, and "telling you what happened." A story could be made up, a fable, a "dramatization," or someone's interpretation of events. I realize that this may seem like hair-splitting, but you must recognize that Jindal is a lawyer. And lawyers think that they can avoid telling a lie by using carefully chosen words.<br>  <br>  True, Jindal wanted to give viewers/listeners the impression that he was actually in the Sheriff's office and helped that Sheriff to make a decision, when he was neither at the location nor involved at all in the decision---which was made long before Jindal even heard about the Sheriff's description of what happened. But Jindal did not actually lie. He merely shaded the truth with the smoke and mirrors of lawyerly language.<br>  <br>  So gather round folks, while I tell you story.............|`|bNykcEVXaa	I don't think they care...<br>  its the democrat lies that matter ..lol

3ME7sBxjaa	Forgetting the death row part, the reason we provide education to inmates is to reduce recidivism.  The justice system likes to believe it is focused on improving society rather than taking revenge on those who violate its rules.  I guess we could make an exception for death row inmates, but honestly, I don't see the point.<br>  <br>  I think the message it sends kids is that society can show some grace to those who wrong it.  Revenge, hate and anger are the sorts of things that lead people into crime in the first place.|`|aFC72tLZaa	Because we have to wait 12 years to murder a murderer.

I am proud to be an American. My  family arrived here in 1629 and they have fought and died for this country in every war we had. They have been on hand to help out every other country in the whole world. We ARE blessed. We are a nation under the one true God. I fly a flag in my front yard everyday.. <br>  <br>  Some of You probably missed this in the rush of news, but there was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper, an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American. <br>  <br>      So an Australian dentist wrote an editorial the following day to let everyone know what an American is . So they would know when they found one. (Good one, mate!!!!)   <br>  <br>  <br>      'An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Canadian, Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani or Afghan. <br>  <br>  <br>      An American may also be a Comanche, Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, Seminole or one of the many other tribes known as native Americans.   <br>  <br>  <br>      An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. In fact, there are more Muslims in  America than in Afghanistan. The only difference is that in America  they are free to worship as each of them chooses.   <br>  <br>  <br>      An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God.   <br>  <br>      An American lives in the most prosperous land in the history of the world. <br>  <br>      The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each person to the pursuit of happiness. <br>  <br>  <br>      An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other nation in the world in their time of need, never asking a thing in return. <br>  <br>  <br>      When Afghanistan  was over-run by the Soviet  Army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country! <br>  <br>  <br>      As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in  Afghanistan .  Americans welcome the best of everything...the best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best services.  But they also welcome the least. <br>  <br>  <br>      The national symbol of America , The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America . <br>  <br>  <br>      Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11, 2001 earning a better life for their families. It's been told that  the   World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 different countries, cultures, and first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists.   <br>  <br>      So you can try to kill an American if you must.  Hitler did.  So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and other blood-thirsty tyrants in the world.  But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself.  Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place.  They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom.  Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American. <br>  <br>  Yes I am Praying, and I am darned well  Proud to be an American. How about you?<br>  <br>  Peace and blessings from Texas <>< The good old USA!!!|`|IzhKZfsMaa	Why would God bless a nation which murders babies my the millions, takes prayer out of the schools, trashes every Sabbath day, teaches atheism in the schools, etc. etc.  I am not going to ask him to help us.  <br>  <br>  We get what we deserve.

sUSfQ9AZaa	Not true. Used cars from private owner to private owner are typically sold AS-IS, meaning you have no recourse at all. You own the car no matter what is wrong with it. Even if the owner did not disclose the problems.<br>  <br>  However, unless he signed an agreement to pay the rest of the money, he could just not pay him the balance. But, if he signed a paper stating he would pay the rest, then your boyfriend could be in legal trouble if he don't pay.<br>  <br>  This is why I never recommend someone buying a car from a private owner. They are usually selling thier problems. And you don't know the history of the car. Sounds like the guy knew he was selling a lemon, and found someone to buy it|`|XdGjhbfMaa	Lemon laws only apply to dealership sales.  In private sales you buy 'as is' and by taking possession of the car you accept it in it's condition.  The buyer however has the right to have a mechanic look the car over before the sale, which your boyfriend should remember should he buy from a private seller again.  You may still have a case though, as the car is acting up so badly that the seller probably misrepresented it big time.  It's going to be difficult to prove.|`|9HdexsSCaa	Buyer beware. You should have had a mechanic look at the car BEFORE buying it. You're pretty much hosed now.|`|jHXUNbYGaa	Nope!  Ever heard of 'Buyer Beware'?  You should have had the car looked at by a mechanic.|`|8j3wUNZHaa	The law is "sold as is".  It is a writen agreement that the buyer signs on a scrap piece of paper.  It can also be verbal.  Very hard to prove.  Does he owe the remainder? NO.  He can return the car and lose $600 without oweing the $400.  Or, you can be a prick and get it running and sell it for $600.  You got schooled.  If this mechanic is a friend of y ours', you should ask the next "car dealer" if he can take a look at it before money is exchanged.  If the seller wants nothing to do with that, he is trying to sell you a lemon.

5xRY3uS7aa	No you can't keep your weapons. And you don't have to jump out of a plane, with are without a parachute. As for as giving advice, just pay attention to your drill Sgts. and keep your nose clean. Try to be the best in you platoon. Keep your wall locker and foot locker in inspection order at all times. One tip you can use, buy a pair of boots at the commissary and spit shine them up. Don't wear them. The Army will give you two pairs when you get issued your gear. Keep that one pair for inspection only. You can put that used dirty pair in your laundry bag. They won't look in there.It's an open secret that's where guys stash there stuff that's not ready for inspection. Before you even leave go to the Army surplus store and buy a brass belt buckle.Get some Brasso and polish the hell out of it. You will have to polish until the lacquer rubs off. It will be almost white when your finished. Be sure to do the back also. Get all the Brasso and gunk out of the inside. Only put it on for inspections. Don't wear it and get it scratched up. You will probably spend a week at a replacement company before you start you basic. Use that time to get everything shined up. That's what I did, and when you get in from training at the end of the day you will be ship shape and getting much needed sleep while the other guys are still up trying to get done.|`|nDvrN6Qgaa	Okay here we go, first off you cannot keep your weapons, they are Army property and expensive.

DTSUJe2oaa	The "courtesy notice" the court sends you after you are cited seems to suggest that you must appear in person twice for a single chance of winning at trial: the first time to plead not guilty, the second to stand trial. This is simply not true. The law allows you to contest your traffic infraction entirely by mail. <br>  <br>  You can appear via mail through a Written Not Guilty Plea (pursuant to CVC 40519(b)). In your plea you can request a Trial by Written Declaration (pursuant to CVC 40902). In this way you can contest your citation without appearing at all and will have a better chance of winning than at trial. Further, if you lose your trial by declaration, you have 20 days to request a new trial! (a "Trial de Novo" pursuant to CVC 40902-d). You then can appear in court for the first time for your second chance of winning. ~
4f3cjyw7aa	I would send a formal cease and desist letter threatening legal action.  Make it sound professional, not just "hey, don't post this crap."

If not, call a lawyer and sue, but it seems small and not many lawyers will probably take it.
3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	Well, the ultimate way to support the Army is to join it, as others have said. But other things you can do is find out if the local VFW or American Legion has a group that meets soldiers coming back/home on leave at the airport to welcome us home, or visit one of the multiple adopt-a-soldier websites and send us letters of support, socks, cookies, whatever. We do love cookies oh-so-much. :) Another thing, if you live near a military installation, is the "Dear American Hero" project (<a href="http://www.dearamericanhero.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.dearamericanhero.com).</a> I just found out about this today -- we went out to lunch and were handed the cards.

ukH1qjCeaa	All that have answered have great advice and I can extend on these.  The military since 1980's has "zero tolerance" at all levels.  If you have signed and committed to a contract for military service and you "pop" for drug use your career is "over".  I am not certain if, at a later date, you can try to re-enlist, but Air Force, Navy, and Marines will no longer be an option.<br>  <br>  Your "discharge" will be of utmost importance for the rest of your life.  You will be issued a "less than honorable" with explanation on your DD214.  Civilian employers, acceptance to most colleges, any government employment, furthering your career will be limited.  Potential employers, schools, etc., "will" do a background investigation disclosing a "less than honorable discharge", therefore, keep you from attaining goals in life. <br>  <br>  My career in the Navy saw many changes and one was reporting to local authorities, as well, any military member showing "positive" for drugs to local authorities.  I never saw nor heard of any arrest, but, to establish a record of drug use that may be used if drugs found, at a later date, on the accused.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  It is not only the consequences if initially "popped", but something that will follow for the rest of your life.|`|jKiVzmnCaa	That early in the game...they'd possibly just throw you out.  If you know that you'll test positive...I'd just not show up to Basic.  Or...if they did keep you, they could easily make your life a living hell.<br>  <br>  I'm just curious as to why someone would smoke pot with prior knowledge that they'd be leaving for the military shortly.  Especially if the person was clean at MEPS...and then hot at Basic.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	They'll wait til you're on the graduation field and then pull you out and make you tell your parents why you're not graduating.

Simple as that.  The Army has ZERO tolerance for illegal drug usage.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	You would be administratively separated.  You would NOT be prohibited from enlisting again at a later date, but you would NOT be allowed to continue with your training at that time.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	They would kick you out and send you home. You wouldn't be alowed to join agian.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you got caught trying to bring pot to Basic Traing you would be arrested. I haven't seen anyone try that one. I am sure that somewhere there are people that stupid. (I'm not saying that about you.)|`|AA11517748	Easy answer, just don't smoke it and no worries, we don't need potheads in the military, I'm a US Marine, and don't want or need someone on drugs to fight alongside me, stay home, I'll fight for your rights to be a moron. OORAHH|`|sgEloO1Jaa	first of all you wouldnt make it to basic because they would have caught you at meps. you dont have enough time between meps and basic to smoke.|`|nMZqHaqCaa	You want have the chance to because you will take one the day you leave for basic
HpJ4wwC7aa	In Sweden, the sale of Alcohol above 3.5% (7 proof) is restricted to people 20 years and over. Restaurants may serve low alcohol beverages to people aged 18 years of age, however most bars and clubs choose to enforce a 20 year old limit rather than 18 years.<br>  <br>  Unusually, the Swedish government owns and controls all liquor stores in the country and they are known as ‘Systemet’ (Systembolaget). You must be 20 years or older to purchase alcohol from a Systemet. The governments of Norway and Finland also own the liquor outlets in their respective countries but 18 is the legal limit in these countries.<br>  <br>  Smoking age = 18<br>  Marriage age = 18<br>  <br>  In England they will serve beer in the pubs to people that are 16 and the same age for buying tobacco products. I think that although Sweden's laws are more strict than most of the rest of Europe, they are still very laid back and open about how they raise their children in Sweden. My friend was a highschool exchange student there long ago and she was able to drink with no problems and she wasn't 18 at the time.

Contractual duties may be delegated to others.  For instance, if you make a contract with a contractor to remodel your kitchen, he will delegate the separate jobs, such as cabinetry, flooring, painting, and wiring, to other sub-contractors.  By the time everything is done, there will have been half a dozen different people working on your kitchen, even though you did not directly contract with any of them.<br>  <br>  However, the thing about contracts which benefits you is that they may also be assigned.  So, you could "assign" the rights to receive the remainder of the security monitoring to the persons who bought your previous residence.

He was clear, however, to show he did not disagree with trusts and capitalism in principle but was only against corrupt, illegal practices.

He was the first U.S. president to call for universal health care and national health insurance.|`|7izywBVyaa	Its because of Theodore Roosevelt's personality, one he did not choose to be the president, he was the vice president and became the president after President McKinley was killed. . He was not at all like any president we have ever had. He was a great worker, a great hunter, a great fighter, but not a great politician. He was too honest and straightforward for politics. He never said anything but just what he meant, and when he put his foot down whatever was under it was going to be hurt. There was no slipping round corners with the new President. He always went straight to the mark. He was a person first, not a politician so people could relate to him.|`|RMYvrn1Qaa	"For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, Roosevelt's commanders recommended him for the Medal of Honor, but his subsequent telegrams to the War Department complaining about the delays in returning American troops from Cuba doomed his chances. In the late 1990s, Roosevelt's supporters again took up the flag on his behalf and overcame opposition from elements within the U.S. Army and the National Archives. On January 16, 2001, President Bill Clinton awarded Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor posthumously for his charge up San Juan Hill, Cuba, during the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt's eldest son, Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., received the Medal of Honor for heroism at the Battle of Normandy in 1944. The Roosevelts thus became one of only two father-son pairs to receive this honor.<br>  <br>  <br>  1910 cartoon shows Roosevelt's multiple roles to 1898<br>  <br>  <br>  1910 cartoon shows Roosevelt's multiple roles from 1899 to 1910<br>  Roosevelt's legacy includes several other important commemorations. Roosevelt was included with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln at the Mount Rushmore Memorial, designed in 1927. The United States Navy named two ships for Roosevelt: the USS Theodore Roosevelt (SSBN-600), a submarine that was in commission from 1961 to 1982; and the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71), an aircraft carrier that has been on active duty in the Atlantic Fleet since 1986.<br>  The Roosevelt Memorial Association (later the Theodore Roosevelt Association) or "TRA", was founded in 1920 to preserve Roosevelt's legacy. The Association preserved TR's birthplace, "Sagamore Hill" home, papers, and video film.<br>  Among the schools, neighborhoods, and streets named in Roosevelt's honor are Roosevelt High School in Seattle, Washington, the surrounding Roosevelt neighborhood, the district's main arterial, Roosevelt Way N.E., and Roosevelt Middle School in Eugene, Oregon.<br>  Overall, historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by permanently placing the presidency at center stage and making character as important as the issues. His notable accomplishments include trust-busting and conservationism. However, he has been criticized for his interventionist and imperialist approach to nations he considered "uncivilized". Even so, history and legend have been kind to him. His friend, historian Henry Adams, proclaimed, "Roosevelt, more than any other living man ....showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter – the quality that mediaeval theology assigned to God – he was pure act." Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents.[87][88]<br>  The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles is named after him."|`|1envyw1iaa	Teddy set up the antitrust laws necessary to go after the monopolies.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	The First Amendment reads, "congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."<br>  <br>  I think that's pretty clear, but Thomas Jefferson later clarified this in a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, dated January 1, 1802:<br>  <br>  "Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus BUILDING A WALL OF SEPARATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE."<br>  <br>  Most of the Founding Fathers believed in God, but many (including Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson) were deists - they had serious reservations about organized religion in general, and Christianity specifically.  Paine once wrote, "of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself, than this thing called Christianity."<br>  <br>  Many believe that the U.S. was founded on Christian principles, but this was simply not the case.  John Adams addressed this assertion specifically in the Treaty of Tripoli (1796): "The government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion."<br>  <br>  The freedom to worship (or not) as we please is one of the things that makes the U.S. a great place to live.|`|AA11622716	Did you have a question about that.

Be careful what you wish for.|`|AA10465540	No, those words are not.  the idea is an interpretation of the Constitution, not a quote.  Separation of church and state comes out of the first amendment that says the legislature shall make no laws establishing a religion or interfering with the free practice thereof|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	The phrase isn't, the separation is.|`|3yrpDNavaa	That phrase is from Thomas Jefferson.  He said that the anti-establishment clause was intended to erect "a wall of separation between church and State."<br>  <br>  So, although that is not the exact wording in the Constitution, I would say Jefferson's definition is accurate, and was what was intended.  After all, it was Jefferson's buddies that wrote the constitution, so I would say that Jefferson's interpretation would be far more accurate than any interpretation you could come up with.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	So, who cares, the Establishment Clause is though and people know what that means. Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to a pastor with that phrase in it. That's where it came from. He was explaining the purpose behind the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment and summed it up succinctly and the phrase caught on.

The document may specify what affairs the "attorney in fact" may act upon, and any conditions before the power becomes effective.<br>  <br>  A legal guardianship is a legal proceeding started by a Court when it is determined that a person can no longer take care of their own physical needs.  Generally, the Court assigns and supervises the guardian to ensure he is acting in the proper interests of the other person (the "ward.")  Guardians are appointed for minors in legal proceedings (i.e. guardians "ad litem") as well as in certain child custody matters (i.e. a foster child's "legal guardian.") However, guardianships can be extended for anyone who is no longer competent to provide himself with the necessities of life (someone old, someone invaild, someone in a coma...)<br>  I don't know what a "temporary" legal guardianship is in your state; you might want to consult an attorney.|`|66a6e81a1bd27adc01f3a526629976d8aa	Power of attorney gives control to another person or entity until the person's affairs are settled.<br>  Temporary guardianship, is just that, temporary.

Es verdad, que la biblia como el coran y otros no se pueden leer sin un guia espiritual ya que solo no los entenderíamos. En cuanto a la respuesta de OHSKAR pienso que debería de tener un poco de respeto hacia los demás, ya que en esta página de yahoo respuestas se pregunta más por la biblia ya que deben de haber más cristianos y católicos que de otras religiones y EL DEBERíA DE RESPETAR ESO.

En cuanto a otras preguntas como dice él, en lo particular si he respondido algo del budismo. Ahora bien, le pregunto a OHSKAR en ves de criticar siempre, porque no haces una pregunta lógica que te gustaría que te respondieran, o tal vez de la religión que tu profeses o del DIOS QUE TU ADORAS O SI ERES UNA PERSONA ATEA QUE NO CREE EN NADA,  ya que nos dices DETRACTORES DE DIOS.

In other places, I do remember the "flight" out of school districts where busing was occurring...not out of race issues, but because it made no sense to spend money busing people so far away based on social issues that the government was trying to mandate. I remember as a 12-13 year old, this is why we moved out of the capital of the state. It was beginning to cost too much, both monetarily and socially. They called it "white flight" in the 70's when it truly wasn't the full extent of the issue.

Also, he refused to ever come back and acknowledge or admit to making any mistakes until he had about a month to go in his second term. And, even then he was reluctant to admit anything.<br>  <br>  Obama, on the other hand, readily admits mistakes and takes responsibility for them. This demonstrates to me that Obama a man of great integrity. I know that, even if he makes a mistake or makes a poor decision, he won't be so arrogant and stubborn as to "stay the course" and fiddle while the US burns.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Hypocrites, Obama one mistake?|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Because everyone does make mistakes and Bush IS a dolt|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	because bush started two wars|`|8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa	Are you comparing "The United States invented the Car" with "There are WMDs in Iraq"?<br>  <br>  You're kidding, right?<br>  <br>  Bush made *A* mistake?  One?<br>  <br>  The list is pages long.<br>  <br>  Lets see - off the top of my head:<br>  <br>  Katrina<br>  Got us into Iraq<br>  Authorized no-bid contracts (i.e. Haliburton, etc)<br>  Lied to the American people (We know there are WMDs in Iraq)<br>  Didn't plan appropriately for funding it or give adequate protection to our military<br>  Told us that the state of our economy was strong<br>  Didn't sign Kyoto agreement and spent most of his term trying to convince people that humanity has no effect on the environment.<br>  Tried to make Hariet Miers a Supreme Court Justice<br>  Tried to have us replace Social Security with something that depended on the market place.<br>  <br>  But from your point of view, the biggest is probably that he made Republicans look like idiots.  In fact, he did more damage to the party than any outsider could hope to do.<br>  <br>  I would think Republicans would want to be distancing themselves as quickly as possible.  Certainly McCain realized that.<br>  <br>  If Republicans really stand for fiscal conservatism, the single largest spending President to date would not be someone they would want to call their own.  Certainly the majority of Americans "credit" him with losing Republican control of the Congress and Republican strategists universally agree that the single biggest problem they had trying to get McCain elected was that the American people associated him with Bush.  So, from many points of view, he is why the US President is a Democrat.<br>  <br>  "You're doing a heck-of-a-job, Brownie..."|`|AA10126668	Because it is a common mistake to believe the Automobile was invented in America by Henry Ford.

I watch both and try to get the real news lol.|`|PdZ9ZYixaa	You appear to have that backasswards. Bush was President long before Obama took office and for eight years every time George told a lie or goofed something up people like you said, ""Everybody makes mistakes!" Now that Barack is in The White House every time he makes a mistake people like you are there to point a finger. Why the hypocrisy on your part? I still haven't head Obama say half the dumb things George did. For example:<br>  <br>  ""Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.

Democrat or Republican does not matter when one party has no say in the outcome of the vote. The Democrats can and will do what they want. This is the joys of one party controlling this nation.

Surely you can't believe that it's never been done by republicans.  Politics doesn't change much, the parties stick together.  That's why McCain lost, people didn't want more of the same after 8 years of Bush blunders.
F6yfJSr9aa	Car injury issues can be complicated.  I think it would be in your interest to consult with an attorney to better understand the potential issues.  It probably isn't a good idea to just post legal questions on Yahoo (trust me, I had a bad experience), when many of the members don't know what they are talking about.  With such an important issue like personal injury, you def. need to at the very least contact a lawyer, even though I know they can be expensive.  When I had a legal problem, I used www.quicklegalanswer.com for my legal stuff and was surprised how fast an attorney answered my question.  It was very cheap and helped me put my mind at ease.  Anywho, just thought it would be a good idea.  If you need anything else, let me know.

The employee is employed as the employer wills or wants it.   If you're not under contract (like when a baseball player signs a 5-year contract, or even a union contract), then you're employed at will.  It is legal for the employer to terminate you at any time, without reason. <br>  <br>  Of course, the answer is much more complicated. An employer cannot discrminate against you because of your race, religion, national origin, sex, immigration status, age so they can't fire you just because they don't like your race, religion, etc.   Also, there are statutes like whistleblower statutes that protect you from retailiatory terminations.  In San Francisco, you can add being fat as one of the illigitimate reasons for termination.<br>  <br>  This applies to the US.  European countries have more employee friendly rules that make it harder to get rid of employees, even if there is substantial justification.

QIMt7K4saa	I just saw my hubby graduate from AF BMT in November.  I wore a tshirt, with a blue "I love my airman" hoodie (light) overtop, with a pair of blue jeans and tennis shoes.  <br>  <br>  Wear something EXTREMELY comfortable.  You'll be sitting on metal bleachers for quite a few hours on Thursday, then another 2-3 hours on Friday.  Afterwards, your bf is going to want to walk everywhere, to the BX, to the Movies, you'll tour his dorm (for me it was up 4 flights of stairs!), etc.  And don't worry about "dressing up"  my hubby was extremely happy to be graduated and with me again, I prolly coulda wore overalls and a straw hat and he'd have been just as happy.<br>  <br>  ALSO: things you can do with your airman off-base.  I recommend going to the riverwalk in Downtown San Antonio.  Seriously, it's beautiful, there are boat rides, malls, the Alamo, good food right on the riverfront (which, he'll want to eat 24/7 x.x) and tons to look at and enjoy.  We went twice so it was wonderful.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your Boyfriend becoming an Airman!!!  Welcome to the AF Family!  If you have any questions my e-mail is lecountress@gmail.com.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|xhyRWBZDaa	I would wear someting nice, but appropriate. A lot of women wear very revealing clothes, and it looks bad on the people who they are there with. The sundress would be very nice, and appropriate.  I live in San Antonio, and the weather is fairly nice.  Right now it is about 83 degrees, but in the mornings and in the evenings it gets a little bit chilly.  It is very windy down here most of the time, so I would take a light sweater in case the wind picks up.|`|A728LXj6aa	It's hot and you're in stadium-type seating.  Don't dress like a tramp but dress for comfort, definitely.<br>  <br>  BTW, if you think you're going to be chilly, you should know that the past week it's averaged 83-85 degrees in San Antonio.  I've heard San An is the hottest city in the country but I'd need to verify this.|`|6wjjxeeOaa	That would be cute :)<br>  It never hurts to just go simple, some dressy pant, and a really cute dress blouse.

A favor de Ernesto "Che" Guevara se puede decir que era un hombre dedicado por entero a sus ideales, dispuesto al  sacrificio, aun el de su propia vida para promover esos ideales.  Que era indiscutiblemente consecuente con lo que el enarbolaba.  Una especie de asceta, duro consigo mismo y sus colaboradores,  rudo e intolerante. Pero es bueno resaltar que Adolfo Hitler ambien fue consecuente con sus ideas, muriendo en su Bunker de  <br>  Berlin, no tratando de huir y escapar como mucho de sus  <br>  colaboradores. No es que pretenda poner en el mismo nivel los horrores cometidos por Hitler, con los asesinatos y abusos  del "Che", sino resaltar el hecho de que el que una persona este dispuesta a morir por sus ideas, no convierten a esas ideas en beneficiosas para los pueblos. <br>   En Cuba el "Che" contribuyo a implantar un regimen que negaba, y  aun niega los mas elementales derechos del ciudadano. Fue el maximo propulsor del llamado trabajo "Voluntario". <br>  Cuando a una persona se le obliga a trabajar en contra de su voluntad sin ser recompensado por su trabajo, a esa persona se le ha sometido a  una especie de esclavitud. En la Cuba Castrista, todo el mundo sabe que el llamado trabajo voluntario, es en realidad obligatorio fueron  victimas de las ideas del "Che".  A pesar de todo lo que se escriba del "Che" tratando de  engrandecer su figura, el hecho irrebatible es que el "Che" fue en casi todo lo que emprendio un total y absoluto fracaso.<br>  Camaguey, zona plana y mayormente descampada, se logra no a base de un barrage de balas y disparos, sino de una andanada de billetazos con los que se soborno a las corrompidas guarniciones del ejercito de Batista.  <br>  Como Ministro de Industrias, fue un incapaz, creando decenas de  fabricas donde las maquinaria, muchas de ellas quedaron oxidadas  en los almacenes.<br>  Fue ineficaz como guerrillero en el Congo donde fue derrotado por un grupo de "Mercenarios", terminando en Bolivia, siendo aplastado por un ejercito de escasa preparacion, no habiendo recibido la  cooperacion de las masas campesinas a las que el pretendia  liberar.  <br>  <br>  Mientras, Fidel Castro continua con sus hipocritas discursos  enarbolando su memoria en su intento por reavivar el fervor revolucionario de un pueblo que ya no tiene la mas minima fe en  las promesas del Maximo lider y que aborrece el sistema por el  que murio el Che y que tan solo ha traido, al pueblo de Cuba escacez y carencia de libertad. <br>  <br>  Les dejo estos links para que conoscan las histrias del "Che" <a href="http://members.aol.com/Guanabacoa/che.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/Guanabacoa/che.ht...</a><br>  Cuatro articulos sobre el Che y los asesinatos.<br>  En Cuba el "Che" contribuyo a implantar un regimen que negaba, y aun niega los mas elementales derechos del ciudadano.|`|c0ffe0d968a4d4d30ffc87c66681c207aa	Cada quien debe trabajar por el bienestar de su país y seguir siendo solidario con los países hermanos.

33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	Well, I would argue that we already do. Hence all of the diets available. As well as the media attacking celebrities who put on a couple pounds. In fact, i'd argue that Jessica Simpson has been criticized more for her Chili Cook off photos than Catherine Heigl has for being a smoker. If you look around there are more diets than there are quit smoking programs. Also, I don't believe i've ever witnessed someone publicly humiliate someone for smoking, however I have seen people making fun of obese people quite often.

6jW5L3Vqaa	Hey ;)<br>  <br>  An indefinite restraining order means it's for an indefinite period of time - i.e. it won't run out. It'll be in effect for life. <br>  <br>  There have been times though, when these have been reversed or removed for whatever reason. If that happens, a Government body, or the police, will contact you to let you know. This is extremely unlikely though, and usually these are never removed. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps ;)|`|AA10352420	Indefinite /permanent restraining order cannot be changed with out your knowing it.

RYQ3i0ZNaa	The results are given to you, on the piece of paper you will receive from your school. The only other people to know the results are the exam board and the school. <br>  <br>  The exam board cannot give information about results to anyone except for you, so even if he calls them or writes to them, he will not find out. <br>  <br>  Tell your school that you do not want them to give your GCSE results to anyone who asks for them, and on the grounds of confidentiality etc. they then are not allowed to do so (at my school even for someone else to pick up the envelope with the results in you had to write loads of letters and fill out loads of forms, so they won't give them out over the phone, or to your dad if you ask them not to).<br>  <br>  He cannot get access to your results, therefore, unless you choose to tell him, or show him the piece of paper with your results on.|`|44AkhdRnaa	Not enough 'stars' on the 'A'?<br>  <br>  Yes, just tell him what you want, if your mum confirms it - what is he going to do?|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	the only way he can see your results are on the bit of paper you have so if you don't want him to see them then make sure he doesn't see your paperwork|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Yeah if he doesn't care, like mine.

You can tell or not tell who you like. I'm assuming you will tell your mum just ask her not to tell him.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	I assume you're asking because you want to know what would happen if he contacts the school. Well, in principle - yes.<br>  <br>  BUT you will have to ask the school/ college not to talk to your dad and that becomes an issue until you're 18.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't live with you - are your parents divorced? if they are and Mum was given full parental rights then he isn't entitled to have that information. So, she can tell the school this. If you are at risk and there's an order against him then, the school don't have to talk to him - but that means telling the school.<br>  <br>  If they're not divorced, or if they were given joint parental rights then no, you can't.<br>  <br>  Sorry.
YupMCYHlaa	Most of the historians I've read see this as a backlash from the Civil Rights movement.  Since the Civil War, Southerners were not able to vote for the Party of Lincoln.  There were actually two Democratic parties, one or the Northwest and West Coast, the 'liberal' Democrats, and another for the South, sometimes called 'Dixiecrats'.<br>  <br>  But after the Civil Rights laws were passed, the Republicans had a 'Southern Strategy' to win the South by appealing to racism and fundamentalist Christianity.  <br>  <br>  Starting with Nixon, every Republican presidential candidate had some racist element in his campaign. For Reagan it was the 'welfare queen' who got 100 welfare checks and drove around in a Cadillac to pick them up (she turned out not to exist). For GHW Bush it was Willie Horton.<br>  <br>  Many of the issues Republicans hammer on are really just proxies for race.  Crime, drugs, welfare, 'inner city' issues, immigration, etc. etc. If you listen to how conservatives talk about these, they are often really talking about race.<br>   <br>  Reagan also exploited the abortion issue and other 'family values' issues to appeal to Christians in the South. He built a coalition of -corrupt- Christian leaders (Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, etc) to convince their flocks that it was their Christian duty to vote for one party over the other.<br>  <br>  In the last few  years, though, Republicans have realized that the race issue no longer helps them.  In many large swing states, the minority population is growing, and Republicans can't win those states without at least a part of the minority vote.  So GW Bush backed off on the racial rhetoric.<br>  <br>  While the Republican Party actually came into being for the sole purpose of ending slavery, the Republicans have been the party of intolerance for 100 years.  Not just racism but EVERY kind of intolerance--anti-immigrant, xenophobic, sexist, homophobic, even religious intolerance.  Gays are the new enemy because they are still a 'safe' target.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	The republican party was taken over by the christian fundamentalists and the democrats became too liberal.  Democrats have recently learned that the majority of people in this country are middle of the road, we believe in fiscal responsibility and that morality cannot be legislated.  I think the dems came to this realization after losing the last 2 elections and thankfully, we now have someone in office who actually USES HIS BRAIN, rather than waiting for word from "god" about what to do next.|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	What you need to look at is not north and south, it is the Cities vs rural. The cities tend to be democrat, then with voting corruption by organization like Stimulus Package supported Acorn, they can win the elections. <br>  <br>  Understand lying and cheating to liberals is an accepted and encouraged practice. <br>  <br>  If you watch them with that point of view, you will see what is obvious to many of us.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	The same thing in reverse.|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	150 or so years of history did that|`|5rL4njnxaa	The civil rights bill- Started by JF Kennedy (D) and signed by a Southerner LB Johnson- alienated many southern white democrats.

n2oEhdZiaa	There are couple subtle differences between the Guard and Reserves.<br>  1. The Guard is approximately twice the size of the Reserves and has a wider variety of units that the Reserves do not have, such as Brigade Combat Teams, Battlefield Surveillance Brigades, Fires Brigades, and Special Forces.<br>  2. The Guard, as a state organization, sometimes qualifies (based on your state) for additional education incentives at state schools.  The Reserves are only eligible for Federal Tuition assistance up to $4500 a year whereas your state may offer it's Guard a 100% tuition assistance program or tuition exemption.  It varies state to state.<br>  <br>  You can do any MOS you want to in the Guard or Reserves as long as you are qualified for it and are willing to drive their to commute.  Was your Army Reserve recruiter telling you that the Guard unit is an engineer unit in your town?  If it is an Engineer company, then most of the slots will be in the Engineer field, either construction or combat.  There will be a small number of support MOS's available in that unit as well.  If it is an Engineering Battalion headquarters company, which is one echelon higher, they will have a medical platoon of 68W among many other support MOS's.  Is there even a Reserve unit in your town?  You're going to have to talk to both, find out what they can give you as far as unit proximity, MOS, and bonus and extra education incentives and then work from there.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	The benefits and pay are the same for NG and Reserves.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Each branch has the same VA education benefits (GI bill, TA, etc), but the differences come in sign-on bonuses and incentive packages (like student loan repayment). <br>  <br>  If you want to be 68W, then you will be assigned to a unit that has that slot available. I doubt an engineering unit will have slots for 68W. More likely you would be assigned to a Combat Support Hospital or Ambulance/EMT unit, at least in the Army reserves.

OnyZtTovaa	No pretendas una falsa imparcialidad, porq tus palabras no son imparciales. Sos el primer intolerante al meter a toda la izquierda en una misma bolsa y no saber distinguir, yo por lo menos distingo entre aquellos q son "fachos" y aqullos q son de derecha, hablando de economia, pero no en cuanto a la libertad y los DDHH. Vos jamas deas espacio al dialogo, simplemente ignoras las respuestas q contradicen tus argumentos.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sandy, te equivocas, entiendo los argumentos de Patriarca: por motivos personles odia todo lo q sea tildado de izquierda. Yo me considero de izquierda, más no "comunista autoritaria". Mucho se habla de la pobreza de Cuba, no creo q el pobre más pobre de Cuba este peor q aquellos q habitan las Argentinas y Capitalistas villas miseria.<br>  Si se refiere a las agrupaciones "violentas de la actualidad", refiriéndose a grupos tales como Quebracho, o los piqueteros, déjenme decirles q más allá de q su reclamo sea legitimo o no, ellos no han tenido la oportunidad de asistir a los claustros universitarios por lo cual no actúan bajo las consignas socialistas o comunistas, etc. porq no saben ni de q se trata el capitalismo, el neoliberalismo, o las doctrinas marxistas, socialistas y comunistas.<br>  En cuanto a ídolos (El Che, Fidel, etc) yo no idolatro a nadie porq todos son humanos, simplemente me remito a tratar de hacer un balance sobre las cosas positivas o negativas q hicieron.<br>  Por otro lado, el se?or Patriarca fue el primero en asociar la pobreza con la delincuencia (más de una vez los hemos visto nombrar a las habitantes de la villa como a una lacra social q habría q exterminar o minimamente extraditar a sus lugares de origen). Si a mi no me cabe ninguna duda q la creciente delincuencia (común y no la de guante blanco) y violencia son consecuencia directa de la enorme pobreza a azota nuestro país. No digo q haya q "premiar" a los delincuentes, simplemente q habría q atacar las causas y no las consecuencias, como han propuesto innumerables veces aquellos q se alinean en la derecha.<br>  Noto un excesivo resentimiento también hacia la Universidad de Bs. As., le explico q alli no nos lavan el cerebro y encontrara posiciones políticas de las más diversas entre alumnos y profesores. En la Facultad nos explican como acceder a la información, nos brindan herramientas para el análisis de los textos, de allí en más esta bajo nuestro criterio saber con cual discurso nos quedamos….<br>  Me parece fundamental contar con “los libros”, es la única manera de saber, conocer, formarse una opinión y decidir en base a ello nuestro futuro, sino todos actuaríamos como masas alienadas (disculpe q meta este termino q no creo sea de su agrado pero no encuentro un buen sinónimo).<br>  En cuanto a q la izquierda vaya a desaparecer, esa me parece una posición muy autoritaria, siempre es bueno q haya un equilibrio entre dos fuerzas q se oponen y se alternan, fíjese q mundo aburrido seria si todos pensaran igual…..y q terrible q solo existiera una hegemonía sin resistencias…..<br>  El 24 de marzo se?or mío, es una fecha trágica porq da inicio a uno de los periodos más tristes de nuestra historia reciente, igual concuerdo con usted en q tampoco se justifica el accionar de las guerrillas tirando bombas por ahí, y q igualmente debieran ser juzgados. De igual forma me parece trágico q haya muerto un docente por reclamar un salario digno, más allá de q lo conociera o no, me conmociona una muerte injusta.<br>   Yo hago un mea culpa q aquellos q me antecedieron en mi ideología: reconozco el error de las guerrillas, reconozco q Fidel creo un régimen autoritario y sin libertad de expresión (aunque desde el punto económico no creo lo mismo q usted). Pero usted no hace la autocrítica q patrocina: usted avala el accionar militar y lo justifica, justifica la apropiación de los bebes “para q las abuelas no ciaran subversivitos”. Pone en el mismo nivel al Che y a Hitler, (no creo q el Che tuviera campos de extermino, ni tampoco creo q Hitler hubiera salido a luchar por lo q creía). <br>  Bueno y sabe q, si me tome el trabajo de contestarle todo esto es por Sandy, q siempre es muy respetuosa, y salio a decir q no tenemos forma de argumentar lo q decimos. No lo hice porq se q usted igualmente hará caso omiso a todo esto, es escribirle al aire, pero en fin, q no se pueda decir q lo q yo pienso no esta justificado…..<br>  <br>  <br>  PD: por favor deje de decir q el actual gobierno pertenece a la izquierda porq no lo es, a lo sumo sera de centro..|`|GnsNMGd7aa	Todo lo que dices es cierto, pero...le pides peras al olmo.|`|I6nopGJJaa	Sencillo, porque eso es un estira que encoge en otras palabras porque la derecha es extrolerante con la izquierda<br>  asi no mas!.|`|Ode4z5EIaa	No soy de izquierda ni de derecha, siempre trato de hacer notar a ambas partes; cuando se extralimitan en el contenido de las preguntas y respuestas.<br>  El contenido de esta pregunta, es por demás provocador; aunque Usted considere que no lo es; poner en un mismo plano a Hitler y Guevara sobrepasa los limites de la lógica.<br>  Recapacite estimado, recapacite !<br>  Saludos|`|Vxf5nljCaa	Yo nunca te censuraría, es mejor que todos lean tu discurso de alabanza a la muerte y se den cuenta de tu ideología.<br>  Tenes que ponerla más seguido ...el malhumor suele venir de ahí, por eso siempre estoy alegre, incluso cuando leo tus disparates.|`|dEU6kx48aa	Hay autoritarismo en la izquierda y en la derecha.

Esto es hablando de guerra, ni que hablar de tiempos de paz donde la moderación, el escuchar al otro por más que piense distinto y no denostarlo de entrada sea de derecha o izquierda. Más vale que los de las ultras siempre van a tener otro tipo de vocabulario más agresivo porque es su naturaleza, porque piensan que no ser agresivos es perder terreno y a mi criterio están equivocados. Una gran persona del socialismo es el se?or Hermes Binner, viví un tiempo en Rosario mientras fue intendente y fue una muy buena gestión.

c85WWXV7aa	Lets be realistic about this. Gun control is a joke. Most crimes that are committed by them are from illegal gun in the first place. But, if you really want to get into this then look at nations that have banned the public from owning guns. Perfect example is the UK. they don't have violent crimes with guns instead they have it with knifes. It is sad to say but taking guns away from people will not slowdown or prevent violent crimes. They will still occur at the same rate. However, the weapon of choice will change.|`|8MUj24s6aa	"The laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man." — Thomas Jefferson<br>  <br>  If they bad guys and other people do not have guns to commit crimes or kill themselves with they will use the next deadliest thing available to them.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	Please look at your concern from the other side. <br>  <br>  I have owned guns my entire life. I've never shot anyone with them. Nobody else has ever shot anyone with them. Nobody has ever commited suicide with them.<br>  <br>  Why should I be punished because someone else has mental issues, or uses poor judgement? Why not look at the reasons the person commited suicide, instead of the tool used? This is similar to the argument I hear regarding banning guns to reduce crime. It's too hard to go after criminals, so let's go after the guns. It makes no sense.|`|VjgqZetcaa	If there were a complete ban on firearms it would have almost no affect on suicides.  In Japan there is a regular hail of people jumping from tall buildings duing hard times.  Should they ban tall buildings to protect the mentally defective from themselves?

It was something like 10 times as likely.<br>  <br>  Fifth, the world is just not a perfect place, and the average citizen should have the right to protect himself/ herself.  the cops cannot always be there on time.<br>  <br>  Rather then assuming that only bad can be done with guns, let's assume that those who will do bad with them can get them very easily through illegal avenues, and that those who get them legally willl more often then not use them only for self-defense or sport such as hunting.<br>  <br>  Sixth, there are many dangerous things in the world, but is it righteuos to deny all of their freedoms, because of the bad guys.<br>  <br>  Seventh, if someone really wanted to there are a lot of things they could do more damage with then a gun, but in the end, we have to trust in humanity, and in the idea that more people will do right then wrong.

We do not always get an animal when hunting but we do go out and enjoy each other in the woods and the out doors. <br>  So yes the guns should still be in the hands of the common person and any law abiding citizen who wishes to own one.|`|YFzprqqgaa	If someone wants to die, theirs plenty of 18 wheelers flying down the highway.  When it comes to children and guns, a mentally deranged kid will find a way to kill someone.  Normal kids are intellegant enough that you can educate them about guns.  I was raised around guns, lots of guns.  My dad kept a loaded shotgun behind the front door all of my life.  I knew not to touch that shot gun, or I'd get my hide tanned.  My dad let me shoot my .22 rifle enough that I wasn't curious about the shotgun behind the door. Quench a childs curiosity about guns and they won't play with them.  My kids have been around loaded guns all of their lives and I've never had a problem of any kind.  Now make no mistake, when other kids are around, I lock the guns up.

SGsI8Eonaa	Hola Help, bueno mi llamado es a no decaer, a seguir manifestándose pacíficamente, no se puede caer en el juego de la violencia que siempre ha de tender el gobierno a través de sus fuerzas motorizadas de choque y de la misma provocación de los cuerpos de seguridad que ya sabemos que solo estan para el resguardo de los intereses del gobierno. No debemos caer en la anarquia provocada, eso precisamente es lo que quiere el gobierno, provocarnos para mostrarle al mundo que somos violentos y que no tenemos razón. Dejémosle la violencia a ellos, no respondamos la agresión con agresión, y estoy en total acuerdo con la chica que comentaba lo de los ni?os de la calle, te puedo dar una idea de lo que le endosaron al pueblo venezolano como "democracia participativa", se compran 24 aviones de guerra rusos y 53 helicopteros de transporte y combate por un monto de 2896 millones de Dólares, lo que significa 6.226.400.000.000 de Bolívares, y también se adquirieron 100.000 Fusiles de asalto rusos AK-103 por un monto de 54 millones de Dólares, es decir 116.100.000.000 de Bolívares, cifras que casi nadie sabe ni pronunciar en este país y que sin consultarle a nadie nos sacaron de los bolsillos el dinero para hacer semejante groseria, paradójicamente, medios de comunicación (privados en su gran mayoría) se abocaron a una labor HUMANA que no ha tenido precedente alguno en este pais, y se llama La Colmena de la Vida, que se dedica a recibir a ni?os en situación de abandono y se encarga de darles educación, comida, trabajo y un hogar feliz además de hermoso, y sabes cuanto costó hacer la Colmena de la Vida??? Solo 1.822.000 Dólares, como te podrás dar cuenta, con el dinero despilfarrado en armamento se hubiese podido construir más de 3.200.000 colmenas de la vida para recoger a todos los ni?os de la calle de América Latina, pero este pueblo prefiere la pobreza, la guerra, y la uniformidad de pensamiento. Solo un alma tan egoista como la de Hugo Chávez puede cometer semejante adefecio. Paciencia que un gobierno no soporta la presión de calle, hay que manifestar pero repito, sin caer en provocaciones, pacificamente que ningun gobierno en la historia moderna ha resistido la presión de calle, ni siquiera este que ya cayó una vez. Gracias|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Como veras son unos metidos también, en tu pregunta colocas CLARAMENTE ABSTENERCE CHAVIZTAS y es lo primero que hacen. Son unos resentidos sociales y por eso te escriben que los que protestamos todos somos de la burguesia, y estan equivocados somos muchos los que hemos estudiado en universidades privadas con mucho esfuerzo de nuestros padres, también se de algunos que trabajan de dia y estudian de noche para poder sacar sus carreras. Te apuesto que esos que se expresan de esa manera ni un bachillerato tendran y por eso hablan de esa manera POR RESENTIDOS SOCIALES.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a los estudiantes venezolanos opositores, les diria que continuemos con nuestra protesta, GRITANDOLE AL MUNDO NUESTROS DERECHOS Y LOS DERECHOS DE TODOS LOS VENEZOLANOS, QUE VIVA LA LIBERTAD DE EXPRESION Y LOS DERECHOS HUMANOS. Afuera los chaviztas!!!! Afuera el odio!!!! y que reine la PAZ. Ya está bueno de divisiones sociales, todos somos venezolanos y cabemos en venezuela. El país no es solamente de los rojos rojitos como se hacen llamar, el país es de todos. BASTA DE ODIOS.<br>  <br>  Y por último le digo a los Chaviztas, es que no ven diariamente la mortandad que hay por la delincuencia? matan no solamente a la oposición sino también a personas del oficialismo. Es que Chavez ha hecho algo por erradicar la delincuencia en el país? es que ven mejores los hospitales con insumos, etc. Es que no ven la cantidad de indigentes que hay deambulando por las calles, la cantidad de ni?os que se han multiplicado desde que está en el poder el Chavez? es que no tienen ojos. como dice Chavez EL QUE TENGA OJOS QUE VEA...ENTONCES UDS. NO TIENEN OJOS. ESTAN CIEGOS.<br>  <br>  Y una de las tantas cosas que Chavez prometio fue...que cuando fuera Presidente iba a eliminar a todos los ni?os de la calle y que se quitaría su nombre si al a?o habia ni?os deambulando por las calles...entonces!!!!! SE MULTIPLICARON DESDE QUE ESTA EN EL GOBIERNO.. Yo vote por él, creí en el, pense que iba ha hacer algo mejor por venezuela, pero estoy como muchos, decepcionada totalmente.|`|dc6aa549e7ebd5d17572197219d995b7aa	RESISTENCIA CIVIL, AMIGOS VENEZOLAN@S  EL DICTADOR ESTA QUE CAE.|`|YbIy2uiyaa	A los chavistas los invito a leer sobre historia moderna y de como han resultado los experimentos socialistas en América Latina sobre todo.

emNCaAq7aa	No ticket. Reports are made for accidents on private property but unless there is a gross violation, like running over someone, there are no tickets.<br>  If you do not have a proper license and insurance there is a ticket but noting for a minor accident.<br>  <br>  In my city you cannot waste police time with fender benders. If the vehicles are drivable and no one is injured all parties have 10 days to file a report. By my state law if the damage is less than $500 no report of any kind needs to be done (insurance companies do require the report but that is not a law).<br>  State law also defines leaving the scene as not rendering aid to injured and not reporting within 24 hours or not exchanging information on scene on a property damage only and not reporting within 10 days.<br>  <br>  You must live in a very quite town that the police have time to chase someone down on a non injury crash.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	I never understand this question in here all the time.

Esigenza e paura più che legittime ci mancherebbe, ma c'è un limite a tutto. E visto che non siamo più nel Medioevo, sarebbe meglio che gli stereotipi venissero lasciati da parte, e che si uscisse tutti da quella stanzina ché dentro si soffoca, e si andasse tutti fuori a prendere un bel po' di ghiaccio e di vento nel muso, non è più divertente? spero di sì, almeno per me lo è.

b8CytinQaa	This is a very interesting Q. Just today, I heard a news report that said the price of gas is going up because there was too much demand. What a pile of do-do. I would like the oil co. to prove what the supply and demand is, I bet that it dose not fluctuate all that much.<br>  I Know we are being gouged at the pumps and I hope you can find the real reason for the thievery thees jackals have gotten away with!<br>  (:} )  go get 'em.<br>  Most likely the real documents have been shredded.|`|2OV8JQhiaa	Go to the gas station nearest you.

They are due to greed and milking the situation.  I oppose government restrictions; however, the government should restrict the amount a gas company charges.  20% of the minimum hourly wage is reasonable, 30% is hard, 50% is ridiculous.

v7rcOht3aa	Common law and civil law have done the job well in their countries. In some cases common law appears to be better especially economically. But civil law has got its advantages as well. Common law or law that is digested from judicial decisions need good courts and judges to work. Where civil law only needs a good legislator. But then again even good laws need interpretation. Civil law even allows more interpretation then common law but common law just doesn't use as much legislation in the first place.<br>  <br>  Conclusion: my guess is common law is maybe a bit better in well developed countries with high standards of education and wel trained judges etc.<br>  Civil law could be the better choice for countries who aren't quite on their feet yet. But as lots of top ranking countries in the world (Europe) also use civil law, it's not correct to look at is as inferior to common law.|`|4ccfa336e8d721730deaa2e0cdead710aa	common law the bad part is that 90% of the people out there have no common sense|`|AA12020119	When dealing with people it is legislated law and common law!<br>  <br>  Civil law is part of that system.<br>  <br>  Religious law is undefinable as most don't have a clue what they are talking about, misquote religious law, and it is meant for those who follow that faith.

dhljEfddaa	He needs to talk with his probation officer first. If his po gives him permission then he will be allowed. However, if he tries to get over without asking permission then when he is being checked in it to cross into Mexico, it might come up on the border patrol computer.

fAaLjlI0aa	A judge does much more than say overruled. When they preside over a trial their job is to ensure the defense is adequately represented, decide what evidence is admissible, and basically ensure that the rule of law is followed to ensure an outcome that serves justice. He advises the jury on what evidence is considerable, he prevents the DA from presenting prejudicial evidence, prevents attorneys from abusing witnesses, and more. The jury decides the verdict based on the evidence the judge allows, which is based on the laws governing the right to a fair trial. A judge can overturn a jury verdict if there was not enough evidence presented to support their verdict, thus leading him to believe the verdict was based on emotion and not on actual evidence, or that the jury failed to understand the criteria that must be met to obtain a particular verdict (such as malice aforethought on a murder charge).<br>  <br>  On top of this, not every case presented to a judge involves a jury. Judges must adjudicate in many types of court cases that do not have a jury at all. In those cases, the final outcome is up to the judge, who must decide what laws apply and how as well as ensure that justice is served for both sides.He has to analyze all materials submitted on a given case, apply the laws of his territory (whether it be state, county, or federal), and decide the outcome. <br>  <br>  There are many types of judges. Federal Judges, Magistrate Judges, Appellate Judges, etc, and each type of judge has a litany of services and duties they perform.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	To make sure that the defendants rights are protected and the trial runs by the rule of law.|`|OiAl6w48aa	In the context of your question, the job of a judge is to ensure the integrity of the trial by jury process.

What is said, rules of evidence, etc.|`|xxOafqfjaa	The job of a judge is to make sure that the American Constitution is being upheld. He oversees the process and makes sure that the defendant and plaintiff/prosecution are following the rules. The jury does decide the outcome but the judge gives the sentence NOT the Jury. If the jury finds a person guilty the judge will say what they have to do to compensate for damages or give the person a prison or probation sentence. The judge is part of the Judicial Branch of government and the Judicial Branch duty is to interpret the law, not enforce (executive) or make (legislature)|`|x6pLsb19aa	The judge also decides what the punishment is for the criminals... other than that there is nothing more to it that i know.
AA11206283	You need a probate lawyer. Period. <br>  <br>  A will MUST go to probate. That is how a will is executed.<br>  <br>  Depending on how the will is written, the estate may well pass to your father's estate; otherwise it can't go to his heirs.

First, whether granny's current will indicates what happens if dad pre-deceases her.  That would require seeing the exact language of her will.  Second, whether Dad had a will.

You did not address any of those and so no reasonable answer is possible.|`|d5c5079cce04b42e4018f3cce72b99f2aa	In WA if a named beneficiary predeceases the grantor under a will, specific bequests go to the beneficiary's next of kin.<br>  <br>  You can retain a trusts & estates attorney and file a petition to be named guardian for your grandmother.  Whether an estate has to go to probate depends on the size of the estate.  There is a threshold of $100K (I believe) that permits you not to go to probate, but you should check with an attorney who handles this sort of thing on a regular basis, which I do not.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

Not only is embryonic stem cell research immoral, but so is everything else that results in dead embryos/babies...  abortions, hormonal birth control, IVF...  And then at what point are women held liable for miscarriages/still births that could have been prevented (such as a result of smoking or whatever else)?|`|Emygjv0gaa	First you have to get past ignorance, like julvrug's answer.

How about this: you and your spouse and your children will all be denied medical treatment that came as a result of stem cell research, if you are sure this is wrong.

We should decrease the money supply by increasing the interest rate, and for the fed to sell bonds and increase discount rate(monetary policy), and the government should fiscally spend less as a government and to increase taxes (income). This is theoretically what we should do to decrease inflation, but what we are doing now is to increase government spending and decrease taxes (fiscally speaking, no idea about the monetary.)

n2oEhdZiaa	What you do is going to be based on your MOS.  The National Guard is the primary Reserve component of the Army.  You go to the exact same job training (Basic and AIT) you use the same equipment (some times its a bit older, but that is changing) and train on the same skill set.  The primary difference is in the Guard, you usually only work one weekend a month with two weeks in the field during the summer, as opposed to the Active Army when you go to the field much more often.  The plus is that you don't have to bother with painting rocks or work details in garrison.  You deploy less often... active Army often spends up to half their time deployed.  National Guard tends to spend around a fourth of their time deployed.|`|k56mmj2eaa	The National Guard, When you go to Basic Training, you will be in training with the men that are really in the army. there is nothing different. You will be required to do everything they do . from running two miles every morning. to push ups to the gas chamber. weapons qualifications. when you get done and graduate you will then be sent to what we call AIT> Advanced Individual Training. then sent home. to do your time with the national guard.|`|N6aHFzk6aa	The national guard is a branch of the Army so all Guardsman will do basic training the same as the USAR and Regular Army does. The Difference is the National Guard is a state militia, that accepts federal money so therefore, and thereby in addition to being able to perform state duties they also perform federal missions like deployments to Iraq, Afgan, etc. State missions is probley the best things about the national guard is you get to help out your home town/state/community. Other branches can't perform these duties because of the pose cumatatus act. But the national guard being controled by the governor of every state can. The governor is to the National Guard: what the president is to the Army. Is a small sense of the phrase. that is the difference in being Title 32 State Control and Title 10 Fedreal Controlled. I hope this helps|`|jqwdoyC8aa	what part of the national guard are you interested in? Air NG. or Army NG. I can tell you about Army NG. Its the same bootcamp as you are to go thru for the Army, Its 13 weeks of bootcamp and another 9 weeks of AIT. You learn everything , and do everything that regular army has to be trained in. You can also be called up to go overseas if the unit you are going to attach to after boot is called up. Theres alot more to it then meets the eye and if you intend to be a soldier, be a soldier. God bless and Good luck on your decission|`|dTP1zSgYaa	Basic training for national guardsmen is basically the same as Basic training for the regular armed forces. A lot of it is based on what job you plan on being. Basic training is different for someone who is going to be a cook than someone who is going to be infantry.
c85WWXV7aa	Well I have not read the book but really don't need to. Start doing some research on global warming. You will see that it is just not Earth. It is every planet in our solar system. This is attributed to approaching the astral plane where space actually gets denser the closer we get and causes more friction. Everything we know about friction tells us the more there is the warmer things will get. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind we are to pas through the center of this plane on December 21st 2012.  You will read a lot of junk about the end of the world and blah blah blah. The facts are the density gets thicker. And we have passed through this plane several times and the Earth is still here.

j0Jyurf7aa	Jeack, no sabría asegurar con certeza que pasará en Venezuela luego del domingo. <br>  Sé, claramente, lo que deseo que ocurra, y es que el proyectod e reforma constitucional sea enviado al fondo de una papelera, de donde nunca debió haber salido.<br>  Ahora bien, en tanto no dispongo de información fidedigna no estoy al tanto de la realidad, y asimismo en tanto en Venezuela ya se han producido una enorme cantidad de nubarrones sobre el proceso electoral nada puede asegurarse con respecto a los resultados de la jornada electoral.<br>  Por ende, se hace muy complejo el vaticinar nada.<br>  Sé, si, que nada será igual tras esta instancia, por muchas razones.<br>  En primer lugar, de ganar efectivamente el NO eso constituiría un golpe tremendo para Chavez, quien ya está emparentando esa posibilidad con un respaldo a Bush, en un patético intento por polarizar la situación, con lo cual su eventual derrota sería aún mucho más traumática.<br>  Nadie puede afirmar qué puede salir de esa mente si descubre que en realidad la mayoría de la población no lo respalda, y sue?a con el momento en que se vaya.<br>  Ahora bien, en el caso de producirse la otra opción, que gane la reforma, pueden darse dos paisajes. En una de esas situaciones, podría entenderse que el triunfo del chavismo estuviese determinado por una maniobra electoral, con lo cual se podría iniciar una etapa similar a la que se viviera en México, pero con aristas más complejas.<br>  La otra opción es que el triunfo del SI fuera legítimo, pero de todas formas determinaría una importantísima cifra de votos en contra, lo cual ense?aría de una vez por todas a la oposición venezolana que la unión es el único camino para obtener la fuerza necesaria para intentar vencer a Chavez, y ello serviría para comenzar una nueva instancia en el juego político, con un país mayormente equilibrado.<br>  En definitiva, sea cual sea el resultado creoq ue se vivirán cambios de significación. <br>  Espero, por el gran cari?o y afecto que siento por esa tierra y su gente, que esas situaciones se desarrollen en el marco de las mejores normas de convivencia, y que no se deba lamentar ni un solo hecho de violencia, ya que antes de los intereses políticos, antes de las ideologías, debe primar el respeto al ser humano.<br>  Que así sea...<br>  Saludos !!!!!!!|`|40TI6LVxaa	ganara el pueblo.

He relied heavily on finance, railroads, industry and the middle classes for his support and cemented the Republicans as the party of business. His campaign manager, Ohio's Marcus Hanna, developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world, and McKinley outspent his rival William Jennings Bryan by a large margin. McKinley was the first president to promote pluralism, arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups.[42]<br>  1900 Campaign poster<br>  1900 Campaign poster<br>  <br>  Theodore Roosevelt was the most dynamic personality of the era. He became the President after McKinley was assassinated in 1901. After promising to continue McKinley's policies, he won reelection in 1904. He then veered left, attacking big business and busting the trusts. Roosevelt anointed William Howard Taft in 1908, but Taft worked more with the conservatives led by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, although more trusts were broken up under Taft than Roosevelt. The Payne-Aldrich tariff angered Midwestern insurgents. The widening division between progressive and conservative forces in the party resulted in a third-party candidacy for Roosevelt on the Progressive, or "Bull Moose" ticket in the election of 1912. He finished ahead of Taft, but the split in the Republican vote resulted in a decisive victory for Democrat Woodrow Wilson, temporarily interrupting the Republican era.[36]<br>  <br>  The party controlled the presidency throughout the 1920s, running on a platform of opposition to the League of Nations, high tariffs, and promotion of business interests. Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover were resoundingly elected in 1920, 1924, and 1928 respectively. Although the party did very well in large cities and among ethnic Catholics in presidential elections of 1920-24, it was unable to hold those gains in 1928.[42]<br>  <br>  In October 1929, the stock market crashed, giving rise to the Great Depression. Hoover, by nature an activist, attempted to do what he could to alleviate the widespread suffering caused by the Depression, but his strict adherence to what he believed were Republican principles precluded him from establishing relief directly from the federal government. The Democrats made major gains in the 1930 midterm elections, giving them congressional parity (though not control) for the first time since Woodrow Wilson's presidency.[36]

Este hombre impone su autoridad pasando por encima de los ideales e intereses de un pueblo pacifico, como lo es el pueblo venezolano. Será que la comunidad internacional no tiene maneras de frenar a un personaje como ese, claramente se puede notar que ese fulano, esta copiando su política de un país que esta en la miseria, de un país que lo que tiene es una hambruna, deseos de salir de la pobreza. Que puede esperar un pueblo de un gobierno comunista, que le den servicios médicos gratuitos a cambio de que? De vivir encarcelados en cárceles sin barrotes, en donde no se puede opinar, en donde hasta para comer habrá que hacer fila, en donde ni siquiera se puede comer un helado libremente. Y no solo eso, los ni?os dejaran de pertenecerles a sus padres porque el gobierno se encargara de lavarles el cerebro y crecerán sin amor a sus progenitores. Estas cosas son simples, en comparación con lo que le pasara al pueblo Venezolano des pues del famoso SI. De hecho ya sabes que el Si ganara, por que su mandatario es autoritario, y tiene sus artima?as para vencer. El triunfo será de el Socialista y Comunista Hugo Chávez.
