He's a bit young for mushroom and I think he would grow out of that one.  It sounds more like a lactose intolerant problem because you mentioned the dairy.  When you cook these other products, do you use milk in them?   That could be why he's having a problem.  He's too young for lactaid milk because I don't think it has all the nutrition he needs that why I suggest soy milk.  It's loaded with protein and so good for anyone.  Personally, I wouldn't drink it simply because I hate dairy products, but my children and grandchildren really like the soy milk.  Try that and see if it works.

ZaLrtSd7aa	What is with these losers and their adspam...<br>  <br>  Burning 500 calories a day if everything else is the same would burn roughly 1 lb a week, 4 lbs a month. A kg is about 2.2 lbs so you would be burning a bit less than 2kg a month. Keep in mind if you're lifting, muscle is heavier, if you eat more BECAUSE you're exercising you may even gain more weight. Watch your diet and you should be fine|`|5xw8NLEBaa	Calories is a big subject when it comes to weight loss. We need to learn three definitions: the volume of calories in our food, the volume of calories a specific activity uses up each hour, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories. The one thing that definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off 20 pounds, it definitely does work!

Good luck ;)|`|xDdmnf80aa	just remeber that smaller portion sizes lead to weight loss. apart from that your diet sounds very healty, so this should be fine, eat dinner. dont forget to exercise for at least 30 mins 3 x a week too. :)

dcAN6to4aa	yes, dont overdose though, u will feel wierd.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	I honestly think you should wait to take any kind of protein supplement for a couple of years, your body is growing and developing still. The best thing to do is to eat some protein about 30 minutes before a workout. Its more safe and healthy at your age. Check out this website for information:|`|WhlwZeiXaa	it's not steroids...<br>  <br>  the typical american diet has more than enough protein in it.  however, if you still feel like you need more, get a whey protein shake and drink it after exercise.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	there is nothing wrong with taking protein at your age<br>  just make sure you know what you want, if you jsut want some weight then you can just eat a lot and work out. protein is for muscle building. to gain weight you need to eat more everyday and eat often. so if you used to eat 3 meals a day you should now be eating 4-5 the amount of food per meal should not increase but simply eat more often.<br>  if you are looking to gain lot of muscle then you need to push your hardest at the gym(get a spotter) then have your protein shake right after your workout|`|ensojBFHaa	What do you mean by 'taking protein'?

There is really no benefit to consuming more than 1.6 grams of protein per kg that you weigh.  So if you're like 140lbs, there's no need to bother with consuming more than 100g of protein per day.  Lifting is the important thing.  Make sure you are in the weight room 3-4 days per week, and that you're doing low reps of high weight.  You are still pretty young, but if you keep up your lifting you should see a boom in muscle growth soon.|`|OAkL8yuSaa	Only if you don't already get enough protein in your diet, otherwise it would be useless.<br>  <br>  It's just protein.. you've been consuming it your whole life.<br>  <br>  If you think you're not getting enough in your diet and want to use a protein supplement, use it immediately AFTER you workout.|`|CURZ8bOzaa	Everyone should have protein.

5obNah1waa	At the store you can buy Mucinex.  This stuff is great.  You have to drink a lot of water, but it really lossens up the phlegm and helps you bring it up.  <br>  <br>  I also take Airborn (can get it at most grocery stores) which helps boost your immune system to fight infections.  I had a cold for 3 days and started taking it and it was gone the next day.  Now, whenever I feel a cold coming on I start taking it and it knocks it right out of me.|`|34HKX2Gnaa	go to the doctors like i did, and get anti-biotics...it helps loosen up the phlegm and gets rid of your cough<br>  <br>  <br>  It worked for me!|`|BY6wT2r4aa	go to store by cough drops. put in mouth.. problem solved. hopfully|`|Um75aRZFaa	If you smoke, stop smoking. The presence of discolored phlegm suggests infection so I would see a doctor if that is the case. To suppress the cough you can try eating 50g of dark chocolate, recent studies have shown it is more affective than codeine which is what is normally used everywhere besides the USA (since it's a narcotic and our country likes to waste money on worthless drug endeavors). There are other over the counter cough suppressants in liquid and lozenge form that you can get at any pharmacy.

dc3aaa83c677145c0949074392c303e5aa	I wouldn't eat them after three days.  It's best to eat eggs as soon as you get them home really because they are already several days old by the time you buy them (unless you have your own chickens).  Be sure to keep them cold (not room temp) the entire time.  Once eggs reach room temp, the chances of them making you sick are greatly increased.  I love boiled eggs, but you have to be careful with them.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	I wouldn't eat them after a few days of being in there

em4F3jw3aa	It's not weird.  I've donated plenty of times, and I have passed out.  You just had a drop in BP from low blood volume.  Make sure to drink plenty of water to replace that.  Have some sugary foods, too.  Don't do any strenuous activity for a day or two, you'll be fine.  Don't be afraid to donate again!|`|H0aiDO9Paa	There are probably no benefits, except for the satisfaction of helping others, and the risk are minor. While some research suggest that giving blood might possibly help prevent cancer and heart disease by lowering the body's iron stores, that possibility is tenuous at best. And donating is generally safe, though it occasionally causes nausea, dizziness, or fainting. To minimize those risks, drink lots of fluids and avoid strenuous activity for several hours after donating. And good luck.|`|4AbXxowTaa	That's weird that it happened hours later rather than during.  I would say that you had a sudden drop in blood pressure, that would cause you to pass out.

MlCNh5cmaa	Boys voices change (a number of times throughout their lifetime). The shape of your larynx and the length of your vocal cords is what determines what your voice will sound like. The longer your vocal cords, the deeper your voice is and every persons larynx is shaped slightly different (which is why we all sound different). <br>  <br>  Most guys voices change once in puberty (around 13-14 years old) going from a really high pitch (girly voice) into a slightly lower pitch, sometimes cracking teenage boy voice. <br>  <br>  Then the voice changes again at around 18-19 years old from the teen boy voice to a more mature, slightly deeper young man's voice which sounds more resonant. Some guys voices never go through this second change and it's usually the adult men that sound much younger than they really are or have "high-pitched" voices. <br>  <br>  The final voice changes (if the guy has one) is sometime in middle age (45-60 year old) when the voice can get slightly deeper and raspier. This is more common in men that smoke our are known for shouting a lot because the vocal cords get more worn out.<br>  <br>  Girls voices also change a number of times in their lifetime (getting slightly deeper as they get older), but not nearly as dramatically as male voices. And since their vocal cords and voice box's are usually smaller than a male, their voices usually end up being much higher.|`|AA10745032	depends on how much sex they get|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	Well My voice is medium but the sex count is off the charts so that answer is very wrong.  It has to do with the tighness of the vocal cords themselves.<br>  <br>  Longer ones are not as tight as short ones.  All males will be much longer than females and thus lower in pitch.  However withing the male spectrum they are everywhere.  Length of the cords is not so much anything more then Genes.<br>  <br>  Also a human can produce sounds across spectrum of frequencies.  How they talk is a learned thing as they grow up. So even a high pitch guy can rumble the coffee table if he so selects to. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

IMzza26Aaa	It is normal to have some discomfort at first but if they are really digging in hard then you should go back to have them tweaked.  My son was given some clay like stuff that he could stick on the ends so they wouldn't dig in.  Did you get anything like that?  If not then a quick call to the ortho. asking about getting some is in order.  My son had a problem with one of the wires coming un-done a couple of times and early on we made several trips back for adjustments.
kFlMHSKIaa	If you've no plaster cast on you can shower - sounds like you have dissolvable stitches otherwise you'd have had them removed 7-10 days after your op. In any case your skin will have already knitted together and hot water won't pull it apart.  Stick to the amount of exercise the nurse has told you to do - she'll know exactly what you can do with the procedure you've had.  It sounds like you're doing very well - I had to have another plaster put on my arm when the first cast was removed following similar surgery because of intense pain.  Hope you recover as well as I did (eventually!)

They are not getting the same percent of air they would get it they were breathing on their own but 16-17% is better than none at all. And that is just in mouth to mouth. If you have an ambu bag they are getting all air, no CO2 and keeps you from having to do mouth to mouth. The ambu bag does not have to be hooked up to oxygen to work, it still puts more air in your lungs than just mouth to mouth. An ambulance always has an ambu bag.|`|bru9ZQeIaa	When you breath in you are only using about 20% of the oxygen you take in.  In CPR you are transferring the unused 60% into the victims lungs.  <br>  The victims body will automatically divert the oxygen to the vital organs.  Which means there is more than enough oxygen to keep the victim alive until ems can take over the care.<br>  <br>  The ambu bag has to be attached to oxygen before it can deliver 100% oxygen and this is not equipment that most people have on hand.

Are you stressed ? It sounds like maybe you need to consult a doctor/psychologist.  Some of your symptoms sound like depression, but could also be the effects of stress.  If you don't want to see a doctor, try some self-help books or take some time for yourself.  Try a relaxing mini-vacation (if possible), or take up a new hobby.  Walking, exercise, yoga, meditation, etc.  Get interested in a good book, soak in a hot bath, play relaxing music.  Try to relax and reflect on what may be causing you to feel this way.

Jm6mkvlWaa	I absolutely love Taylor Swift but when I first saw the video for "Love Story" I got worried that she had fallen into the celebrity eating disorder fad. But, looking back at what I've seen since she first came out with "Tim McGraw" I would have to say it is completely natural.  She may have lost a few more pounds but she seems to have a good head on her shoulders and so many friends and family actually care about her. I doubt she has or will develop an ED anytime soon.  And plus, think of how much she tours and the added stress. That put with always being on the go probably accounts for her slender physique.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, and I don't in any way mean this as an insult, I think that 124 is "too" skinny for 5'10."  I am 5'5" and if I get below 125 everyone around me starts freaking out. Granted, I have wide hips and a bigger bust, but I am no where near overweight for my height. I can't imagine being that tall and weighing that little. Of course, genetics and body shape is what a lot of it depends on.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|sDwN4XuIaa	Okay, I am 5'9" and recovering form an ED.

Being 5'11" and 124 is way under weight, your BMI according to the Internet is 17.3 That is below weight, you may want to look into that.

ded808853f2e26f3c03a870d532ebb95aa	Hi.  I have Biploar II.  It is a serious illness.  There are several forms, biploar is cateogorised by periods of acute depression and mania, or less 'manic' mania, known as 'hypomania'.  It's a really hard condition to live with, but it can be done.  Around a quarter of manic depressives (bipolar) end up committing suicide.  It is hard learning to live with it though.  Yes it is a serious mental illness.  It is recognised in the UK as a disability.  Symptoms - acute periods of depression  - low mood, no energy, suicidal/self harming thoughts, black and bleak thinking, possibly obsessive tendencies, introversion, lack of social interaction, crying all the time - these are just some of the symptoms.  Mania and  hypomania symptoms = elevated mood - less sleep, increased sexual activity, excessive spending, inappropriate behaviour,,,  there is a lot of different symtoms.  I have bipolar II, which is characterised as having long periods of depression and occasional mania, with periods of ;normal' behaviour in between.  I take anti depressants, a mood stabiliser and a sedative for sleep when I am high.  It takes time to learn to manage, but it can absoutely be done.  Please wish your friend love and luck from me.  It's not the end of the world, though it will feel like it.  You can live with it, you need to learn how to manage it.  thank you for being a terrific friend to them. xx|`|Y4jAAwTnaa	Bipolar disorder can vary in its severity but is classed as being a serious mental illness. Bipolar Disorder is also known as manic depression. It cannot be cured, but can often  be controlled with medication often of the mood stabilising variety or anti-psychotic medication.<br>  An easy answer would be to tell you that someone who is bipolar may suffer from an extensive period of high emotions(manic) or low(depression) which will interfere with the daily living of their life.<br>  They may suffer other symptoms which may include delusions, hallucinations, euphoria or anxiety. They also may not suffer any of these.<br>  A psychiatrist normally diagnoses this illness although it can be misdiagnosed as their is no blood test or x-rays that can help with the diagnosis. Normally it is diagnosed in hospital.<br>  <br>  Under correct medication, people with bi-polar can go on to lead relatively normal lives.|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Here is just one website which could give your more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.realmentalhealth.com/bipolar/overview_02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.realmentalhealth.com/bipolar/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You see, there are many stages of the Bipolar illness.  Some are manic-depressive, some are just manicky, and others are more depressed a lot.  Some could swing a bat at you and not blink an eye, while others would isolate and hide from their friends.  In other words, there are extremes.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully, your friend is not to an extreme, and will accept treatment with a medication regimen.  Sometimes getting on the right medications takes time, too.  Because different people act differently to what they are prescribed.<br>  <br>  May God bless you both at this time.|`|JsfSS1o8aa	yes severe depression is a major symptom of bipolar disorder, without this a person is not bipolar wich means to poles one being mania - a hightend mood and depression its a bit more to it than this <br>  look on mdf.org.uk for more info|`|cI6vT8yJaa	1.

I was actually really scared, he looked that bad. <br>  <br>  He was still under the drugs though... but he said that it isn't as bad as people say, and it isn't as painful as it is just uncomfortable. You'll be fine, don't worry!|`|7UQUkhjZaa	It all depends...<br>  <br>  Possible factors include your age, how invasive the extraction is (simple removal vs. impacted teeth that have formed into the jaw bone), etc.  Also, the bottom ones are usually the most problematic because of the jaw bone, nerves running through the area, and (I think) decreased blood flow to the area (not sure on that last one). <br>  <br>  I had mine removed Monday... Day two and three were the worst, but the pain was pretty much controllable with the pain pills they prescribed.

Alternating workouts forces your body to burn calories faster. LOW INTENSITY EXERCISE....Your heart rate should not go above 70% of your maximum heart rate so that you will burn mostly fats instead of sugars.  Try to do at least 20-30min for each workout.<br>  <br>  Do not increase distance/intensity/duration in any combination by more than 5-10% per week. You get stronger when your body is recovering so you should rest 1-2 days a week. Injury will be minimal and swimming helps sore muscles to recover faster. Reduce your caloric intake and more fruits and vegetables--junk food is a no-no. Easy cycling will burn the fat in the legs and calves. Swimming will burn fat and tone muscle. <br>  <br>  Look up the term glycemic index and try to eat foods that are high in complex carbs and complex sugars that are low on this index... e.g. instead of white potatoes eat sweet potatoes, whole grain bread instead of white bread. <br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: Make a schedule and stick to it. e.g. Monday Swim/run, Tues. Bike, Wed. Swim/run, Thurs. Bike, Fri. Swim/Bike, Sat. Show off 6-pack abs at pool. Sunday Show off 6-pack abs at pool.<br>  <br>  Save your money and avoid supplements except for multivitamins. Your cost effective recovery drink is chocolate milk. (Milk is where whey protein supplements come from anyway).  <br>  <br>  It also helps motivate you if you sign up for a race or some kind of sports event. See you at the finish line.<br>  <br>  P.S.

Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that.

c84a1d17484d06ded093e2e049596aaeaa	Hey, I have the same problem -- I'm addicted to chocolate -- and I'm trying to keep off the inches for Easter Break. What I've been doing is whenever I really crave sweets, I grab a big handful of carrots (my favorite) or an apple and something small that will satisfy my craving, like one chocolate chip cookie, or a fun-size chocolate bar. I eat the carrots or other healthy food and eat them slowly. When I'm finished, I eat the chocolate just as slowly and wash it down with a big glass of water. This usually satisfies my cravings really well, since I feel full and have the taste of chocolate in my mouth, but really I've eaten mostly healthy stuff. Remember, sweets are not poison. They're just good in moderation. And after a while you'll get used to eating small bits of sweets at a time.    I really don't recommend you take any supplements that anyone might advise. Cravings come from hormones, and any pills that might change hormones are very dangerous.|`|OQb533GPaa	A lot of experts say brush your teeth when you get this craving.

See how your body takes this. Build yourself up. Re-strenghten your muscles.<br>  <br>  If you go from nothing to running - it might set you back. Make you feel even worse!

The alcohol was a big plaster which covered a wound temporarily. <br>  <br>  Give your body  at lease 21 days to recover and realise that it doesn't want alcohol at the moment. IT will be craving it's what it was used to.<br>  <br>  You are also going through a lot with your ex too. You don't need the hassle of drink to mask things again. Time will allow your body to stop feeling depressed when you deal with things sober.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I know that things will work out for you.|`|uUGSLs9Daa	hmm not to sure, <br>  but with me if i have drink with friends on a night out im far from depressed<br>  <br>  but if i stay in a invite friends round for a drink, i get really emotional,<br>  <br>  i think it just depends on what you drink and where, and what songs are on aswell lol<br>  <br>  mabey your feeling like that because you have told yourself to stop drinking|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	dont blame not drinking.<br>  the bible says, wine is a mocker and strong drink is raging....<br>  the bible says to drink a little wine with your food.... and to stop drinking water....<br>  <br>  i drink organic milk and pressed fruit juices and herbal teas to make up the fluids in my body.....<br>  <br>  also a spoon of hiney is ace, 3 times a day.<br>  <br>  try try try....... your body needs cleansing.|`|Rkt2g45gaa	Well..stress..! its man made...try to engage with something makes you happy and busy..like if, you lik watchin movie..try...either you like to walk or sit alone...better way..plan to relive...its easy...dont drink make you insane again..<br>  <br>  Alex...|`|TyFBrelcaa	Alchohol makes your brain slow down|`|yx1dPYZVaa	I agree- alcohol is a central nervous system depressant- not an emotional depressant.<br>  Alcohol masks real feelings, especially as you said you were drinking enough to concern yourself into stopping!<br>  <br>  So you have given up drinking too much, had an emotional break up AND have other stuff in life going on as well...not a huge leap to imagine you are stressed and low.<br>  One day at a time, and please get professional help if things don't improve- talking can help hugely!|`|nbv6Z01iaa	I was a very heavy drinker and it can make you depressed.  Your body is still adjusting to not having that crap.  If gives you a chemical imbalance when you stop.  I quit drinking for 6 months and the first 3 were the worst.  I was put on anti-depressants.  Life feels good now!  Wait it out a little longer, but if you still feel this way in about a week or so make a doctors appointment and see if maybe you need to be put on something.  You can be treated for short term depression 6m-1yr.|`|OVmzkRTOaa	Alcohol has a depressant effect on the brain where it slows down responses and reasoning capacity. Using it to "self-medicate" and escape the issues in your life puts you at increased risk of physical and psychological illness.<br>  You are feeling depressed because you are dealing with intensely painful issues which you acknowledge are not simply about the breakup.<br>  You are wise to have stopped drinking as it only serves to complicate the issue.<br>  My advice would be to try and focus on one thing at a time and set yourself small achievable goals. Stay physically active as this helps to stimulate the production of "happy" chemicals in the brain.<br>  I wish you well.

My chole<br>   sterol numbers are over the 300 mark. I took lipator and it made my<br>   muscles sore so my doctor took me off them. Now heres crestor and<br>   Im just debateing on rather I should take them. High cholesterol runs<br>   in my family so I know I need to try to find a lowering cholesterol med<br>   to keep my cholesterol down so Im going to try them and if they do<br>   bother me I'll stop takeing them and go for the omega 3 fish oil. My<br>   Dad and mom both take this and they told me thier doctor was amazed at how low their cholesterol was in 3 months. So I might try<br>   the omega 3 fish oil for myself. My mom buys a 400 count bottle of<br>   omega 3 fish oil at walmart for around 12.00  Hope this helps you!

Seems that most males are close to their father's height, but you have to remember that you are a combination from so many different genes that no one can be certain.  One things for sure though, don't bother hanging yourself upside down from a tree branch by your feet, it doesn't work.  Saw that in a movie or something I think.  Just try to accept who you are and enjoy life.  If you feel that you don't like being short just remember that when you dance with girls it's pretty cool to have your face at breast level.

TfR9sEa1aa	No, I do not think you should be to worried about this at all. You are still getting your period correct? So, I am pretty sure that you are not pregnant yet. but, on to the brown discharge.. most doctors will call is spotting. There is nothing wrong with you at all.. have you had a change in your diet? more stress? anything that effects you in your daily life will effect you inside your body always remember that. I think that all it is, is you are going through spotting. You have to remember this is your body natural way of cleansing your self.. discharge periods all that. also, if you are experiencing odor to the discharge it might be simple as a infection, but again nothing to worry about that can always be fixed. I wish you good luck at your doctors appointment I hope you just relax more because I personally do not think something is wrong with you. I have experience quit a bit of things that would freak most women out but it ended up all being normal.|`|UHKJ9Xsjaa	Hi  Anna<br>  I'm really not sure what that could be, but as it has no odor and it's not itchy, it does not sound like an infection (which is quite comforting). How are you doing ttc? <br>  Periods are due next week and I'm hoping they won't show. Trying not to think about signs of pregnancy, just trying to take it easy. Hard not to think about it. <br>  Let us know how you get on. Sending you tons of baby dust to you and all ladies ttc.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I'm sure its fine.. Try not to worry to much.. When you got married did you stop taking the pill or anything? I have heard women who have problems like these after being on the pill for awhile. Maybe that has something to do with it.

Maybe every week, 2 weeks or even once a month.  That is what my doc told me when I was trying 17 years ago.  I have 2 teens.  If you wait on the sex and not every day it builds up and has more force coming out when it's built up.  Good luck to you and hubby.
baWh7kYoaa	Velocity Diet from T-nation.com<br>  <br>  In a nutshell: liquid diet all week with one solid meal.  Kind of cool the first day or two as you find it convenient to be using a blender to make all your meals.

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!

It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is.. I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.  She teased at me at first and I felt embarassed about it and she told me her secret on how she lost her weight.  She gave me a book entitled "Strip That Fat" - within a month I lost 18.3 lbs!<br>  <br>  I seriously recommend and urge you to learn more about this since it has helped me a lot - it demystifies false beliefs like low fat diet, eating low carbs and such help you!  <br>  <br>  Learn the real truth:<br>  www.Strip-That-Fat.tk

However, since you don't have health insurance, I know that can be hard. Perhaps you can go to a Chiropractor, as most of them will check you out, and do a first adjustment for FREE. Call around, and find one who will.<br>  <br>  Till then, you can try ICING it with ice packs. Don't get it too cold, so use a rag between the ice bag and your skin. That can take down any swelling, and help. Do NOT use HEAT!! That can make it worse!<br>  <br>  Try to pay attention to how you are holding your neck. Perhaps you are unconsciously tightening your neck muscles, which continue the cycle.

aff17852f481fa3b1744f02627931146aa	You literally sound like a commercial for bipolar disorder.  don't worry you're fine.  Bipolar is where the patient has extreme mood swings in a short amount of time.  One minute you'll feel depressed, the next you'll be manic (Euphoric).<br>  The best advice I can give you is to see your physician first for the primary diagnosis, then see a psychologist.  When looking for a psychologist, it is usually good to go for 2-3 appointments first, because first impressions aren't everything.  If referred to a psychiatrist by your primary physician, you will want some different types of meds.  You will want an antidepressant, and a mood stabilizer.  I don't know what is prescribed for manic symptoms.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Sure, it could be related to a bipolar disorder.<br>  Or, just simply... depression.<br>  <br>  It is okay, kiddo, to feel that way.<br>  Except when it becomes a consistent<br>  problem, as you describe.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd talk to one of my parents about it.<br>  Tell them you don't know why you've been so moody,<br>  and ask them if they could take you to the doctor,<br>  just to get a blood test and make sure it's nothing<br>  medical going on.<br>  There are so many things that can cause us<br>  to feel depressed, for instance thyroid problems.<br>  I don't know your family history or medical history,<br>  so I can only encourage you to get yourself a checkup.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, <br>  I pray the Lord gives you the wisdom, strength and courage<br>  to find out what it is that is really bothering you.<br>  <br>  May God bless.|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	Sounds like a form of depression.

WJjr2E0haa	I know how you feel. I use the ring and I was very confused at first. Well, here goes.... I have my husband put it in but you might not have this option so here is what you do. Get the ring and hold it with 2 fingers (which ever ones you are going to use to insert it) and pinch 2 of the sides together to make it look like a bow. Then you gently insert it like you would a tampon. DON'T WORRY IT WONT GET LOST UP IN THERE (i was afraid of this). <br>  <br>  Now, it is true that you are protected for up to 3 hours after it is removed but I suggest that you leave it in during sex. It won't get pushed up any higher than it should be. Now, he might feel it but probably not. <br>  <br>  Something that I notice sometimes is that I can feel it (kind of like when you need to change your tampon) and that is because your muscles down there think they need to push it out but just push it back up and the feeling is all gone. (This doesn't happen very often but it will). <br>  <br>  My major suggestion to you is for you to keep track of when to "discard" your ring because I forget the date that I put it in and just keep on going remembering 1-2 weeks later. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and don't be discouraged. It's all good and it is something you don't have to think about everyday. (OMG you think I should be a spokesperson for this or what LOL). Good luck.|`|nbv6Z01iaa	squeeze the ring so it becomes thin and insert.  You can take it out during sex or keep it in.  Your partner may or may not feel it.  If you take it out, you have to rinse it before reinserting.  Make sure you do not go over the 3 hr. mark.  If you don't take it out it will not get pushed up as it has no where to go.  Trust me it will not get lost.
zzAprLEQaa	its odd that the coffee did that to you but there are a few things you have to take into account for your side effects. you said that you hadn't had coffee before and that's the main reason. the second thing is the amount you had and how fast you drank it. all of those together made your experience what it was. Small amounts over a longer period of time would have let you stay up a bit longer with a less severe effect on you body. meaning less of a crash. also the thing with coffee is it does have a lot of caffeine in it and that has different effects on ppl.|`|oymv7Sk4aa	ask my dad<br>  he looks like this after too much coffee o_O|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Coffee is highly acidic on the pH scale. and has lots of caffeine, depending on your size and the amount of  coffee and sugar that was in it will determine the outcome.<br>  <br>  For now you are fine, it will be gone out of your body after a day or so<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cfnk42" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cfnk42</a>|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	Lose weight???? she doesnt want to lose weight she wants 2 stay awake lol!!!<br>  <br>  I'm suprised at the effects your experience, i probably drink about 6 cups of strong coffee with 1 sugar a day (i know its really bad for you) and i have never felt like that!<br>  <br>  I'm no doctor but im guessing that it was probably more the lack of sleep and that was just added to by the coffee and sugar hit!

They should have been cleaned with a disinfecting solution to get any bacteria off the lens before putting into you eye. Water alone does not disinfect.

It may be nothing but it may be something too.  I had minor hand pain turn out to be something that could have gotten serious enough to require surgery but it was caught early.

sDwN4XuIaa	actually when trying to loose weight you still need to make sure that you are feeding your body enough to compensate for what you are working out.  I am not saying to eat fatty foods, but calorie counting can set you into a bad spiral.  You need to keep your calories over 1000 a day at least, loosing weight isnt somethign that will happen over night, you should try to average about a pound a week, I know that seems slow but if you loose it to fast then it can hurt you in the long run.  It sets you off on an ED path, a path you dont want to deal with.  Also dont weigh in every day,  Your weight fluctuates daily and so one day you may be a pound or two heavier than the last day.  Also pick a time to weigh in, you weigh more in the afternoon than you do in the morning.  My advice is to yeah watch what you eat but dont limit it to the point where you starve your self for the foods you crave.  ITs all abotu learning moderation and learning your body specificly|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Honestly don't listen to the people who are saying you can't have chocolate cake.  It won't do anything if you only have it every once and a while.  If you go insanely strict, your chances of binging are a lot higher.  I lost almost 150 lbs and I ate cheese, chocolate, and other "bad" stuff every once and a while.<br>  <br>  You ate alright so long as the snack pack and cake thing aren't daily occurrences.|`|w1F0tWbRaa	not with the chocolate cake..and fish pie ?|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	I'm not sure what's in the fish pie, but you could use something with some extra calories since the beginning of the day was not nearly enough. I know people have gotten on you for the chocolate cake and it's not too bad every once in a while. Just be aware, that added sugar holds on to fat. Also, if you are not getting enough calories from nutritious items, your metabolism will slow down and weight loss won't work either. Oh, and the last thing, make sure you're getting some exercise mostly every day. If you don't, weight loss doesn't usually happen and it sure doesn't stay off.|`|FNeCDm3raa	chocolate cake as a snack?<br>  <br>  Yeah right.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	cut out the cake and your fine|`|Bbe8U9r2aa	well you could do without that choclate thats whats ganna keep you from loseing weight|`|cIUYAmHPaa	The pattern for losing weight is easy - eat less and workout more - the problems appear when we actually try to put that into operation!

GykweMSfaa	I meditate more than 30 years, so I have to tell you that I don't know life what is without a daily meditation.And interesting to know that only recently it become a subject of scientific interest <br>  Here's the explanation you want to know.<br>  The meditation { and I tell you, any form of meditation } is a form of  physical and mental relaxation which is associated with changes in the secretion of several pituitary hormones. The hormonal changes induced by meditation, mimic the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid also know  as gaba It is hypothesized that meditation produces changes in pituitary hormone secretion that is an important fact.<br>  Meditation effects both physiological and psychological changes of the mind and the body. It forces you to put the conscious mind aside and unleash the hidden truths about your inner self. <br>  Experiments were performed demonstrating that meditation does better the health { I was never sick in these 30 years } and well being of an individual by altering the autonomic system of the brain. Instead of the fight or flight mechanism, which causes blood pressure to rise, the rate of the heart beat to speed up, for example , meditation aims to replace the sympathetic panicked feelings. Rather, meditation calms the nervous system. <br>  Among the various physiological changes experienced by subjects practicing meditation are lower blood pressure, slower heartbeat, rate of respiration, and rate of metabolism,<br>   Meditation changes mental and physical well being through a heightened sense of control, concentration, and relaxation. <br>  Beyond these significant physiological changes, there is a change in the perception of the meditator. With observation comes increased awareness of the content of thoughts and images. Patterns and habits begin to emerge, and feelings that were once overwhelming begin to be just a part of the whole that is being observed.<br>  I’ve already got an another stage of meditation which goes into different healing light visualizations and breathing exercises. I also have added creative visualization which is more of what I’m looking for right now.  Actual scenarios go through while you visualize what you want to realize today, tomorrow , or,for life .<br>  Creative visualization is a very dramatic tool for your personal realization. I use it on a regular and daily basis.<br>  What an awesome time to be a meditator in these days of intense financial stress !!!!!!!!!!!<br>  First of all, I recommend you meditate every day. If you haven’t meditated during the day, just sit on the edge of your bed for five minutes before lying down.<br>   Let it get to be a habit, like brushing your teeth.

The intent originally for meditation was to loose track of the body and gain that connection to the mind and spirit. Most style focus on breathing as well as an internal chant or mantra. Find one that you are most comfortable with and start using it. You will find that it can help in focusing your mind which also means you can begin to exercise more control over it as well. <br>  <br>  If you would like assistance with controlling your emotions you can reach me on Skype kevin.wolchansky I am a registered Clinical Hypnotherapist. <br>  <br>  Be Well
qnD5RfbPaa	When pus accumulates in the tissues, organ, or confined space in the body due to infection, an abcess forms. Abcess may result form a lowered resistance to infection. Abcess can be formed in the brain, lungs, teeth, gums, abdominal wall, gastrointestinal tract, ears, tonsils, sinuses, breasts, kidneys, prostate gland, or almost any other body part. They can be produced by bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi.<br>  <br>  Boosting your immune system is a good way to start treating this condition. Eat fresh pineapple daily. Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme that fights inflammation and aids healing. Eat raw garlic or get yourself a garlic supplement. This is very important since garlic contains enzymes that acts as natural antibiotic. Eat mainly or all fresh raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds for a few days. Drink mainly juices made from fresh raw fruits and fresh raw vegetables for a few days. You may supplement your diet with zinc. You may take up to, but not exceed 100mg per day. This will help to boosts your immune system. Along with the pineapple, consume grapefruits, lemon, and other citrus, berries, carrots, cantaloupe, onion papaya, sweet pepper, broccoli, brussels sprouts, avocados, bananas, mangoes, collards, kale and spinach. Fresh raw foods are most effective.  These carry enzymes that are very effective for clearing inflammation.<br>  <br>  Other treatments recommended are charcoal, clover oil, green tea or other herbal teas, a good herbal parasite cleanser (that which creates a bad environment for parasite), fresh aloe, hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotics. I believe it is important that at all cost you try to preserve your own teeth. Extraction should be a last resort after all else has failed. I came across this website. You might find it helpful.  <a href="http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/tooth_abcess.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/tooth_a...</a><br>  <br>  Please note:  If while eating pineapple your teeth become sensitive, it could be that the protective lining of your teeth has been compromised as a result of not producing enough collagen.  This can be corrected by consuming foods rich in vitamins A and C and calcium.  Some of these foods are already mentioned.  Hence in addition to those mentioned you would then need cabbage, asparagus and all green leafy vegetables, cows milk and other dairy products including yogurt, as well as foods that are orange and yellow in color.

I'm sure you are worried about him, so you keep telling him how much you are worried, how much you care, and you keep giving him attention.  This is the gain.  He likes the attention, so there is no reason to do anything about the situation.  Stop discussing it with him.  Let him know that you can do nothing to help him so to stop discussing it with you.  He knows where he has to go for help.
m4lu8HcYaa	I work as a radiologic technologist in a hospital. Your doctor's office probably just didn't get the results yet. At the hospital where I work the tech checks the films and if she sees something she has to get the films checked with a radiologist. Then we do special views. If we don't suspect anything, the patient leaves and the doctor reads the films later that day or the next depending on their workload. After he reads them, the films get shipped to this place where there is a machine called an "auto cad"-This is just a computer that scans mammograms and also gives a report to verify that what the doctor saw was correct. Its just like a back up. There is a lot of detail in a mammogram, that is why there are so many steps to the process. <br>  <br>  I honestly don't think that the reports got back to the doctor office yet. As for the pain, I would definitely let your doctor know. And next year when you have your mammo, make sure you inform the technologist of any pain in your breasts. That will assist the radiologist in getting the best reading.|`|zXjkjjmpaa	Don't worry about it until you get the results.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~

You know pushups will do wonders for your arms and core. My little brother is a Marine and got me into doing them and they really do work. haha.<br>  <br>  3) Eat a good healthy breakfast to jumpstart your metabolism. Eat 6 smaller meals throughout the day if you can to keep it going. For dinner eat lean meats and veggies. <br>  <br>  4) DRINK A TON OF WATER.<br>  <br>  5) Try and avoid foods likes pasta and potatoes.<br>  <br>  6) eat whole grain bread..and if you can get bread with no high fructose corn syrup.<br>  <br>  7) drink skim milk<br>  <br>  8) try and stay away from sugar as much as possible.<br>  <br>  I think just random things like this could help you lose the weight you want.

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master cleanse" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is.. I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.  She teased at me at first and I felt embarassed about it and she told me her secret on how she lost her weight.  She gave me a book entitled "Strip That Fat" - within a month I lost 18.3 lbs!<br>  <br>  I seriously recommend and urge you to learn more about this since it has helped me a lot - it demystifies false beliefs like low fat diet, eating low carbs and such help you!  <br>  <br>  Learn the real truth:<br>  www.Strip-That-Fat.tk|`|7t4vpqpyaa	Take the t-lite diet it really works seriously i lost 4 pounds in a week!|`|oymv7Sk4aa	me wants chocolate|`|6C5NDSBSaa	I agree with Kayla. T-Lite is a good diet. Strict though...you have to follow the meal plan for it to work. I would suggest taking any red meat and pork out of your diet. Drinking as much water as you can handle every day. No sodas. And cook with safflower or olive oil. <br>  To get toned, get the Core Rhythms dvd. Its great because its 'dance fitness' and you can have fun while you workout at home. I love it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck!

FSuHBCMHaa	Stress induced hair loss or telogen effluvium can cause rapid loss of hair, but it normally grows back after the source of the stress is removed. I would suspect it may be related to your diet. you may be suffering from a vitamin defecit or lack of proteins.These are the most common causes of hair loss. One of the biggest causes is a lack of biotin and other vitamins. If I was you I would try hair supplements. these are safe for men and women and contain what you need. I would also make sure that you are getting plenty of fruit and vegetables in your diet. This will go a long way to stopping the probem.|`|7t4vpqpyaa	No!!! it's in ur genes|`|oymv7Sk4aa	well if you're stressed then yeah, that would explain it<br>  but otherwise I don't think it would be your eating habits <br>  <br>  (:

Use steam, then a clay mask to bring the impurities as close to the surface as you can. Then, use hot water or steam again to keep the pores open. Then and only then apply the lemon juice with a cotton tip.
6b7KFgtpaa	You'd be surprised with the muscles that are involved with certain exercises.  You work muscles you that you don't think would be involved in certain movements.  Assuming your doing the right form, your thigh muscles basically need to catch up with the other muscles involved in that movement.  <br>  <br>  Having said that, there are a number of other exercises that that you don't think would involve your abs that leave them pretty worked at the end of the session.  Look up some total body workouts and compound exercises that involve free weights.|`|eSqsYYoDaa	Well muscle soreness usually occurs when there is a lactic acid build up in the muscles after the muscles complete a strenuous exercise.

DtG4zpM2aa	You would need to apply for medical school initially, it would be a 4 or 5 year course depending if you got onto a graduate course or not, followed by 2 years of working as a junior doctor before you could start training in psychiatry, which would take at least another 5 years for you to be fully qualified.   There is no other way around this, despite your experience.|`|AA11864715	I think it would be the same route as everyone else, being a mental health nurse would make no difference to the training you need ie medical degree/conversion medical degree, qualifying as a doctor, then SHO posts etc.<br>  You would think that there would be a more suitable scheme, wouldn't you?|`|VJ7RH9Tpaa	look online|`|ouzrDPaSaa	You would have to go through the usual route and complete basic medical training first, although if you already have a degree the graduate 4 year medical course is an option.
fTztIC22aa	I finally found a question that I can appropriately answer with HIIT. High instensity interval training. It will make you stronger, faster, and give you more endurance. it's about a 4 week program so it should work perfect for you. If you want to lose weight and tone I suggest 6 small meals a day very healthy and clean. Only water so you can reduce your sodium intake. Sodium causes you to retain water, so if you cut sodium you can lose water weight thus making you toned. I'm not going to take the time to write a routine out for you. I do have one in mind. If you would like a complete diet plan and workout regimen join cagedanimal.net and post your question and I will answer it on there or email me.Good luck with your goals!<br>  Site that explains HIIT:<br>  <a href="http://www.intervaltraining.net/hiit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.intervaltraining.net/hiit.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Oh and don't do what penguin says if you're trying to lose weight running 5 days a week is not the solution that can cause your central nervous system to become too stressed which you don't want.

If its rough at first, then run for 2 minutes straight then walk 3. repeat.<br>  3. Find a big hill and sprint up it and down. Repeat several times for 2 min.<br>  take a break then start over.<br>  4. Set cones up in a field or your back yard if you have room. Set them several feet apart( half football field is best, but any distance is good) sprint across touching down near the cone and then to the other side. repeat. Its more fun if you have someone to race you.<br>  5. DONT DONT DONT drink juice or milk or soda when on your running days. It will make you sick and you will throw up.<br>  6. Drink plenty of water. <br>  7. if you get tired when running put both arms above head and take deep breaths but keep walking. <br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|Bbe8U9r2aa	running running runing everday lunges, squats things to get your legs stronger

Once the bleeding is under control, apply a sterile bandage to the area. If it continues to bleed you may need to see a doctor. Also, if it has been 5+ years since your last tetanus shot, you will need to get one.|`|AA10436595	OUCH!!  I would wash the foot very thoroughly and put some hydrogen peroxide on it (or Germ X). The bleeding is probably washing it out and won't be bad for it.  If you want, you can apply direct pressure with your thumb to stop the blood.  Then put a bandaid on it and keep your foot covered with a sock or house slipper.  Be sure your tetanus shot is up to date.|`|htSZsds7aa	Let it bleed so it washes it out. then was and apply neosporin and clean bandage. keep a sharp eye out for blood poisoning, a red line running up your leg. Puncture wounds are hard to clean and if the needle was dirty it may have shoved dirt deep into your foot. If in 24 hrs there is no sign of infection, just keep it clean and dry.|`|IFnrRtMQaa	Maybe ring up A&E and ask them what you have to do.<br>  They'll give you advice or tell you to go into the hospital to get it checked out<br>  xx|`|1TPGdaXJaa	I would bandage it up and go to your Doc, mainly for a teatnus (sp?) shot to make sure you don't get sick from it.|`|658c97c2e40e2eb3b804b250ef53cb21aa	Wash the wound with running water.<br>  <br>  Press on it till stop bleeding.<br>  <br>  Put a dressing on the wound.<br>  <br>  Take some pain killer if you are not allergic to it.
688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	You would most likely have a reaction immediately.  At most up to an hour.  My son has food allergies and when we did the "food challenge", the waiting period was one hour.    If you are not familiar with the food challenge, it's one of the last tests that they do to determine a food allergy (if the blood test and RAST test are inconclusive).  They have you wait one hour because that is the window of time within which you would have a reaction.  So you consume the food and sit and wait in the doctor's office.  The doc is nearby in case medical attention is required.    I think you need to call a doctor to find out what's wrong.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	yes to all of your questions.  read labels 3 times each, avoid the offending foods, talk to a nutritionist, keep benedryl/zantac/epi pen handy.|`|o5EGMbpjaa	it Might just be something going around but you Might be allergic to eggs or chicken or something that is in both of them.

o8Xfn2bfaa	Tylenol will definitely help alleviate some of the symptoms, you might want to try a decongestant too or a cough and cold over the counter medication|`|lAI9Mxcnaa	Your symptoms sounds indicative of a viral infection (not cured by antibiotics) rather than strep throat.  Vitamin C and drinking lots of fluids will help.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	drink more water, use a nasal rinse, try Claritin, and follow up with your doctor.
N9nJWYa5aa	How long is a piece of string?  I love pilates (and I'm a guy).  I'd recon if you aren't carrying too much body fat, then it would probably and realistically take upwards of three months to get toned.  It all depends on how hard you can push yourself.  One of the main advantages of pilates is that it's a style of fitness that fits into and has an effect on your life (ie you'll increase your strength, coordination and balance).<br>  <br>  As for an ideal amount of time, 90mins three times a week sounds good, but it activities that you can just slip into your daily life when you have a free minute or two, even if it's some where odd like waiting for a bus!|`|F2gYMVQXaa	i've never done pilates but i believe that every form of toning exercise will take the same amount of time.  personally, i lift weights and it took me at least 3 weeks to see anything significant.  after 2 months it was definately noticable<br>  <br>  90 min of pilates?  that's intense, but you may get results faster with that stuff i dont know.  just keep with it!  when you get results you'll be happy as hell!

I used to have TERRIBLE acne but now I have it under control.    First make sure you are washing with a gentle and unscented cleanser. I prefer the Aveeno deep clean foaming cleanser. Very gentle and very good for your face.    Then (here's my secret) I take unscented milk of magnesia and pour just a little bit in my hands and rinse my face with it.   Rinse off.     Your face will be dry after ward so make sure you put a good unscented moisturizer on...again I prefer Aveeno.     The milk of magnesia is a wonder drug. Your face should clear up very quickly|`|lY1uPhmMaa	try tea tree oil has to be 100% tea tree oil u can find it at walgreens or something even walmart apply the oil on the zit at night and in the morning it  apears smaller even gone sometimes still use a normal face wash everyday and tea tree oil 2 times a week|`|q0hZBDrVaa	put your sperm on it and it will start to go away|`|noujkaM7aa	try PROactive.

Other things to note: drink as much water as you can, try a slice of lemon in warm water in the morning and evening (it's nice don't worry and it also detoxifies from within), sleep as much as possible.  If you are young don't try too much unless your acne gets bad, because some people are just lucky and don't have it where as people like ourselves aren't so fortunate. Just try to wait it out until your about 20 it should get much better because your skin won't be greasy and oily like it is when your 15 or so.|`|HpqGnCFAaa	Go to your doctor and ask for a prescription any over the counter stuff is crap. Ask for benzaclin it works well. Also try to wash your face twice a day with a facial soap not regular bar soap! try a soap that has oatmeal or other vitamins or moisturizers in it.

If your hungry...eat. If your not...don't. If you have a fever take paracetamol, your body will still fight the infection regardless.|`|MPvfyt8Daa	starve a fever, feed a cold    it is true|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	Your first option . . . starve the fever to limit the fuel you give your body to use in generating an increase in fever. Feed a cold to give the body the fuel it needs to fight the virus.    Like most 'old wives tales', there is some truth to it. With fevers, you hydrate  to protect the body from de-hydration . . . usually with juices or light sodas drinks to add a little nutrition. With colds you hydrate, as well but add easily digested foods light light soups, jellos etc. Once you feel like heavier diets, go for it!|`|GqsLNUE8aa	The saying is starve a fever feed a cold but the truth is you should feed both...kinda obvious when you think of why...food and fluid will only make you better no matter the ailment. I think the saying came about because usually with a fever ya lose your appetite. :)|`|reO9Dgmsaa	It's "feed a cold, starve a fever." I think it's kinda bs, since you should eat if you want to regardless of a cold or fever! LOL!  It's important to stay hydrated regardless.  I notice my toddler refuses solids when she is sick, even if she doesn't have a fever; she just wants to nurse nurse nurse and occasionally have a sippy of diluted juice.      **Medicating a fever to lower it is dangerous.  It's part of our bodies' natural defenses.  When a fever is present, viruses and bacteria are weaker and easier to kill.  Our white blood cells are stronger at higher temperatures, and interferon works better in the presence of fever as well.  :)  If antibiotics are necessary, they work better in the presence of a fever.  Contrary to myth, the brain will not cook itself at higher temperatures.  You just need to rest and not become chilled or overheated.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I think it is feed a fever and starve a cold. Because you are feeding the fever fluid to try and break it and stay hydrated. With a cold, you are trying to get the congestion out of the body and not taking in to much for fear of puking.     I totally just pulled that out of my butt!
4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	No, a week should be okay. Just take it easy and increase your calories slowly. Nothing too heavy, stay away from fried foods and heavy sauces (you should anyway).

If that really bothers you, you could try taking the tampon out and doing it with your fingers if you're more comfortable with it.  And if that doesn't work, you could put some petroleum jelly on the tampon and slide it in like that.      Experiment.  If it really bothers you, stick with pads.|`|AA11856960	You might have a tipped uterus.  I have one and it is very difficult to comfortably wear tampons.
AA11048920	Hi Madeline, I have had MS for 20 years now. There is no classic  way that those of us with MS feel who have muscle weakness. Some of us do feel as though we are weight lifting. My legs at times feel as though they have 100 pound weights  on them. And sometimes I just can't get my legs to move the way I want them to and there is no feeling of a weight being attached to them at all.  There are over 2,500 diseases and conditions that can cause muscle weakness so I wouldn't focus on MS as the cause. If your doctor cannot come up with a diagnosis, please see another doctor. My doctors told me that my symptoms were all "in my head". It was not until I lost my ability to walk that I was finally diagnosed. Please persist until you get find a doctor who can tell you definitively what you have. The best of luck to you.

All the power to you!|`|AA10723498	As one who lived with an alcoholic husband for 7 yrs, I'd say yes, you are and if not, you sure are on your way.  Listen to what you said.  You plan your activities around your beer drinking, you count your beers before you go out.  That means you can't do without it.  Shaking is a classic sign of alcoholism.  It's your body's way of letting you know that it wants more beer.  It's withdrawal through the week.  You said you only drink on weekends, so why not try and see what happens if you don't buy the beer.  If you find you're going "crazy" without it, then you have a problem  Please do something about it now before it gets out of hand.  Depression is another classic sign of not having your beer.  Your body has to adjust to fact that it cannot have the beer on Monday after you drank it all weekend.  I bet those signs disappear in a day or two until the weekend arrives again.  You are not hopeless that's for sure.  For your sake and your wife's sake, seek some sort of help.  Go to an AA meeting and they will tell you the same thing.  I worked in a detox hospital for a couple of years,  I took care of patients who were going off drugs and alcohol and let me tell you. some of them were really hit hard with withdrawal because they drank every day.  In the morning, their coffee was hard booze.  Like I said, you haven't reached that point yet and you don't want to.  I'm sorry if you don't like my answer, but I want to be honest with you and I want to see you get some help.  I pray you seek out help and advice form an AA meeting.  Try it a couple of times, you will learn a lot.  Be blessed|`|uDOVf2vvaa	I have worked as an addiction specialist and I think you are on your way to being one. It's good that you have realized that you might have a problem before it is a full blown issue. Since you don't have to drink to get through the day I don't think your body is physically addicted yet. I would start by slowing down on the weekends since it still mostly in your head that you need to drink. However, you may want to get help soon because you don't want to wait until<br>  you have to drink everyday or you can't function. Alcohol withdrawals  are horrible, I've seen it first hand and would hate for you to get to that point. Get some help and good luck!|`|cr5TQgmUaa	Yes. There is no doubt. And this is a progressive disease. You may eventually justify drinking "just a couple" of beers after work. It sounds like you're becoming concerned; you should get a grip on it now because you can only go down from here.|`|AA11238703	yes, when you start planning your life around the alcohol consumption, and thinking about drinking in advance, you have a problem.|`|AldxcKwnaa	I'd honestly say no but you are very close. Try to quit for a month and then you will know where you stand.|`|m3aeDtIsaa	Often, if you are asking the question, you may already know the answer.  Thinking about drinking all weekend is not a good sign nor is planning your weekend around your drinking.  You have some signals that you may have a serious drinking problem.  Talk to a counselor or attend an AA meeting.  You may only be drinking on the weekends now but you are at risk of drinking daily.  As one who has been sober for 13 years, I too, started out as an occasional drinker and eventually was a daily drinker.<br>  <br>  Seek out some help.  It will benefit both you and your family.  Good luck.

yT3ZNEROaa	No its not illegal.  But an old prescription may not be the same anymore, for example it may not be effective anymore, or it may have gone bad.  If you are buying the drug illegally and saying you have an old bottle and could have a drug test soon, I don't think the people who are testing you will fall for it.  Best would be to revisit you Doc. have a new prescription written and go from there.  Things may have changed and you may need a different dosage now that your older and possibly bigger or smaller, or you may need a different drug all together.  Take care and good for you to be going back to school.  Who knows, now that your older you may be able to pay attention and not need to take meds. anymore.

t6Szjngmaa	A lot of factors come into play when I hear this question:    How old are you?  Have you recently experienced something traumatic?  Have you experienced a cyclic shift from a heightened sense of emotional   reactivity to your current state?    You might be dealing with a hormonal issue, an imbalance due to a radical shift in production (puberty, menstrual cycle, drug reaction, menopause). This is probably the least worrisome cause of all, since it typically resolves itself.     Another possibility would be clinical, or more complicated still, manic depression. The best course of action for you to take would be for you to see your family doctor for a referral to a mental health professional.     Never try to self diagnose or self cure something that manifests itself in phases of lethargy concurrent excitability. It could prove to be damaging and dangerous.|`|exf4OhPkaa	thats def not good. you should talk to someone you could be depressed or if its people that caused it get those people out of your life.

Is your acne caused by your hormones. Or is it because of something your doing (like touching your face with your hands, cellphone, etc).    2. You've got to know your skin type.    To tell if your acne is hormonal...you must observe your breakouts.     If you breakout on your chin first before any other part of your face (namely the cheeks and the forehead)...    ...then your acne is due to your hormones. And unfortunately this is the most difficult type of acne to treat. And you'll most likely have to visit a doctor.    So let's hope that it's not due to your hormones.     But if your breakouts first occur on your cheeks and/or forehead, then it's due to a "bad habit(s)".    Like...touching the face with your hands, pencils, cellphones, etc. Or even wearing a head band or bandanna while working out.     All these habits can be the cause of your acne.    Now if your acne is due to "bad habits(s)"...then it'll be easier and cheaper to treat.    You can even make your own treatment at home.  But...    ...you'll have to cut those habits out.    The website below gives some information about homemade acne treatment. You can check it out...    http://www.facialskincarefacts.org/HomeR...    Finally...    You should know your skin type.    Knowing your skin type will determine what kind of products to buy. Many people rush out and purchase products that weren't made for their type of skin.     And in the end they realized that they wasted time and money.    So find out first whether your skin is dry, oily, combination (both dry and oily), normal or sensitive.    You can do a free skin analysis online at this page of the website I recommended earlier:    Click below for the skin analysis:    http://www.facialskincarefacts.org/Facia...    I hope the information I provided will benefit you.|`|ahsgk6bXaa	Try crushing up some aspirins with a bit of moisturiser to make a paste, use it like a scrub.

I think it's just a coincidence that it happened right after you started drinking. Just be sure to drink lots of fluids and take tylenol to lower your temp. If you have a temp for more than 3 days, schedule an appointment with you doc, because it could be something that requires antibiotics.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Drink plenty of fluids and rest,  you got the flu on top of the hangover.
7TQ5qGWcaa	warning signs of suicide or suicidal thoughts include:     Talking about suicide, including making such statements as "I'm going to kill myself," "I wish I was dead" or "I wish I hadn't been born"   Securing the means to commit suicide, such as getting a gun or stockpiling pills   Withdrawing from social contact and wanting to be left alone   Dramatic mood swings, such as being emotionally high one day and deeply discouraged the next   Being preoccupied with death, dying or violence   Feeling trapped or hopeless about a situation   Increased use of alcohol or drugs   Changing normal routine, including eating or sleeping patterns   Engaging in risky or self-destructive behavior, such as using drugs or driving recklessly   Giving away belongings or getting affairs in order   Saying goodbye to people as if they won't be seen again   Developing personality changes, such as becoming very outgoing after being shy   Warning signs aren't always obvious, though. You may try to keep your suicidal thoughts and feelings secret.     Types of suicidal behavior  Suicide is actually a complex set of behaviors that exists on a continuum, from ideas to actions, including:     Suicidal ideation. Having thoughts of harming or killing yourself.   Suicidal behavior. Engaging in acts intended to cause your death, or acts that while unlikely to cause your death indicate that you're self-destructive or suicidal. These may include overdosing, reckless driving or excessive drinking.   Suicide attempt. This is a nonfatal, self-inflicted destructive act that was intended to cause your own death.   Parasuicide. This is an act that may resemble suicidal behavior but that isn't intended to cause your death. Such acts may include deliberately injuring yourself, such as cutting. Some people find these acts emotionally soothing. These acts may result in accidental death.|`|3XWxs1ruaa	no, its reallllllly not okay. trust me thats EXACTLY how i was 5 days ago omg day and night thinking of suicide imagining it 24/7. even with the car thing. omg exactly the same. but my parent send me to a psychiatrist and he said i had depression and he put me on these pills called prozac. and im supposed to go into therapy. also, it wont go away im telling u this for sure, if anything it will get worse and ull start planing untill it actually happens. please get help, ur totalllly worth it. and whether u know it or not people love u and care about u and wouldnt want that to happen to u.get help, u wont regret it.  p.s. ive been through all of that and am still going through all of that, i cut and have been for 2 years and all thats happened is that its gotten worse, and im 14. by the way cutting can get adicting like everytime something happens u turn to it and it will eventually kill u. good luck hope this helped. feel freee to email me if u want|`|3694eca278728fd0a36c2ea7419c2fd1aa	Its not normal for a teenager  but seems like u need help  maybe speak to ur family or ur doctor and dey cud prescribe sum anti depressant|`|MgZXxgqUaa	It might.

xvey8ixPaa	Do you mean wearing contacts longer than their recommended wearing times? Like sleeping in contacts not prescribed for that? Lots can happen.  Not all contacts are healthy to sleep in. Some people do this regularly and think nothing will happen. We see people like this all the time that have no idea what can happen. It is a good question to ask and to know about. Look these up and get their definitions and see if you can find pictures. They are all usually caused by over wear and misuse of contact lenses.    Corneal Neovascularization  Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis  Corneal Ulcers    All of these are extremely painful and very serious. Complications from these issues can lead to blindness. It has been documented and tested. This is why there are few contacts that are approved for extended wear by the FDA and they mandate that you should only wear them when supervised by a doctor. So....please consult your doctor if you need to wear them more than your waking hours! It sucks when you get an illness from over wearing them!|`|OQb533GPaa	One of my cousins before he died (he was an eye doctor for many many years) told me the thing to look out for is making sure your eyes are moisturized.  A lot of times people don't moisturize their eyes enough when wearing contacts and when they get older the corneas crinkle up and there are dry spots on the eyes.      With glasses your eyes continually degenerate over the years (I'd assume the same with contacts).  There are exercises out there that you can do with your eyes to help make your eye site better so you don't have to keep getting stronger and stronger prescription glasses.    I got lasik . . . not sure how many years it's going to last me, but everyone I know who has gotten it done has been well pleased.  I've had mine done for 3 or 4 years now and I'm happy as a clam.

AA12269381	Yes that's fine.  The ibuprofen should help out with the headache, fever and sore throat.  <br>  Also, if you're sneezing or have an itchy feeling around your nose, an antihistamine might not be a bad idea.

Usually in a syrup like tussin DM.  If you're coughing up phlegm, thats a good thing though, and you shouldnt try to suppress the cough.  <br>  <br>  As a side note - Dayquil, Nyquil, etc are combinations of the pain killer/fever reducer, antihistamine and cough suppressant.

7TQ5qGWcaa	The term steroids is often misunderstood. Corticosteroids (a class of drugs used to treat arthritis and many other conditions) are often just called "steroids". So what's in a name? Confusion results when they are mistaken for anabolic steroids (drugs used by athletes to boost strength and enhance physical performance). What is the difference between anabolic steroids and corticosteroids?    Answer:     What is a "Steroid"?    According to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the term "steroid" is a chemical name for any substance that has a characteristic chemical structure consisting of multiple chemical rings of connected atoms. Some common examples of steroids are:    Vitamin D   cholestrol   estrogen   cortisone    Steroids are critical for keeping the body running smoothly. Various steroids have important roles in the body's reproductive system and both the structure and function of membranes.      What are Anabolic Steroids?    According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, anabolic steroids are synthetic substances related to the male sex hormones (androgens). They promote growth of skeletal muscle (anabolic effect) and the development of male sexual characteristics (androgenic effects).    The proper term for these compounds actually is "anabolic / androgenic" steroids:      anabolic refers to muscle-building   androgenic refers to increased masculine characteristics   steroids refers to the class of drugs

9QyrW2iCaa	If you don't eat for several days your body gets the message to slow metabolism and conserve, conserve, conserve!  This means that although you will lose some weight initially, it will be mostly water weight which is not a true weight loss.  Also, your body will reset its metabolic rate thinking it needs to conserve fat and you'll have an even harder time losing weight in the long run.  You will most likely not experience any long term weight loss from short term starvation.     Most of the time the best thing is to avoid high fat foods, large portions, mindless eating and get some form of regular AEROBIC type exercise.  If you can increase your muscle mass (don't worry about bulking up like a body builder--this just really won't happen) you can burn even more calories!    No, you probably won't die from not eating for a couple of days.  Many people that you know are probably against this because they know that these starvation techniques go against common sense and want to spare you the trouble.  Also, short term starvation dieting can cause problems with potassium depletion causing abnormal heart rhythms.  This is rare, but possible.    Good luck to in your weight loss efforts!|`|HMhUKAgkaa	It's EXTREMELY unhealthy. Starving your body will NOT help you lose weight. Your body will adjust and store the fat you have because it doesn't know when it will get more. Eating healthy and exercising will give you the fastest results.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well the problem with crash diets, is that you eventually get hungry and then you eat a bunch of junk.  I did work with two girls once that fasted every monday for world peace.  You didn't gain weight over night, you are not going to loose it over night.  I was watching something on tv about a new diet where you eat two bananas and a glass of milk or water for breakfast, and then you eat normal the rest of the day.  I wasn't paying attention to it because my puppy had to go potty, but you might want to look into that.  They say it is better to eat 6 small meals than 3 regular meals.  You also need to remember 3 to 1.  Three grams of fat per 100 calories, so some of the granola bars may not be healthy for you.  Read the labels on what you are eating.  You do have to watch the fad diets.  Everyone went on a cabbage soup diet, and then got in trouble when their blood sugars dropped.  Then there was that fad diet where people were supposed to eat a bunch of meat, and everyone got grout.  Readers digest says cut one thing out at a time.  So with lent coming up, maybe you could cut out soda, or snacks, keep it real.  I saw a thing on tv where it said 3 sodas added 11 pounds a day, so maybe switch to diet soda, they have good flavors of diet sodas these days.  I would eat what you normally do, only eat a little less.  I think if you just drank water, you would pass out, but I am not a doctor.  Garlic makes you pee and salt makes you retain water, so use garlic instead of salt.  Eat a lot of fruits and veggies because they are mostly water.  You burn more calories eating celery.  There was a book I think back in the 80's "It's not what you are eating, it's what is eating you."  That might be a good book to read.  Sometimes people gain weight because they have had a traumatic experience in their life, or because they have a ton of stress and they use food as a comfort.  I think weight watchers says you should eat a pickle if you crave sweets.  I think if you are craving something, you should eat a bite of it, because you end up eating a million things and finally eat the thing you were craving.  I have started walking for an hour everyday, well every day the weather allows.  We have a new puppy and she needs daily walking because her breed has a lot of health issues, so we are trying to keep her really healthy.  I find it gives me peace.  I just walk laps around the yard, and sometimes I take my walkman and listen to music.  It is a nice break from the stress of my world.  You might try sports that interest you, swimming or skating or whatever you like to do.  Eating a lot of watermelon or canteloupe or brocolli also helps you loose weight faster.  You have to consider things like that because a candy bar and yogurt have the same calories, but it is easier to burn off yogurt.  Maybe your school nurse, or your doctor could come up with a diet. Oh, I remembered a lady saying that when she snacks, she sets a timer for 3 minutes, and she eats her chips or whatever, but only for 3 minutes that way she eats her chips, but not the whole bag.|`|exf4OhPkaa	YOU HAVE TO EAT!!!! If you don't your whole body could get completly out of wack. You also are sooo hungry from not eating that your body can't concentrate on anything else. I have a friend who used to not eat because she thought she was fat which she totallly wasn't but anyway her whole body got messed up and her body became very weak and she lost a whole lot of her muscle. That was over 2 years ago and she's still getting over it today. My advice just eat healthy and exercise not eating at all can ruin everything.|`|EevMUAqJaa	Because it's an incredibly unhealthy way to lose weight. By not eating, you'll lose everything that you DO need, including iron, calcium, etc.  Instead of not eating, try healthier options. Fruit is always good, and citrus fruits give you Vitamin C. Bananas are a good source of potassium. Green grapes are a personal favorite of mine, and I really like strawberries, too. Also, you can get a bunch of ice and fresh fruit, put them into a blender, and viola! You have a delicious smoothie. My boyfriend makes a killer drink for after dinner. :)  Also, be sure to include all of the breads, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and protein that you need. For recommended food habits, you can check the Web or go to the YMCA, where personal trainers are there to help.  Good luck!  Rachel|`|6MwIvHlNaa	If you don't eat your organs start to fail (your liver alone needs about 300 calories a day).    You brain suffers too and mental tasks before more difficult, so not a good idea if your a student.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	since you are so young you need to talk to your parents they can help/ support you, not eating is very very bad and unhealthya dn can acutally deter your weightloss     lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|Ihfj1lRmaa	Your body will store calories because your putting it in starvation mode. Bad idea.

Eat half the food on your plate and save the rest for the next meal...|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	You are still in school, so nutrition is extra important. You may lose weight, TEMPORARILY by not eating, but eventually you will need to eat. Then what happens? The weight comes back, and more probably. Listen to your friends and parents. They care. Chances are, you don't even need to lose anything, but if you do, do it the right way. Healthy eating and exercise.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Your friends and mother are absolutely right in making sure you eat. If you deprive your body food, your body is going to go into "defense mode" and cling onto every bit of fat you have in an effort to preserve calories. Sure, you will lose weight, but as soon as you start eating again you will gain it right back as your body will still be in "defense mode" and store up those calories you eat, expecting you to starve yourself once again. Not to mention there are numerous other health risks involved in starving yourself.    The least amount of calories you can consume without causing your body harm is 1200 calories per day. To lose weight you can certain lessen the amount of calories you ingest, but you shouldn't stop eating all together. Ask your mom to set up a doctor's appointment so that you can ask him/her what your ideal weight should be and healthy ways to lose weight if you need to. The doctor will have the best answers for you.|`|al0cCPb6aa	Even anorexics eat food. Not eating is just really damaging to your body. You should at least consume some calories...the more you refuse to eat, the more your parents and friends are going to make you eat. What you need to do is just eat a little. Just eat lunch and dinner...but eat really healthy. Tell your mom you want to be a vegetarian...that'll cut down your calories SO much, I eat like a vegetarian and I've lost 16 pounds.    Just watch your calories and excersise. If you realyl want to lose a lot of weight then just consume about 500 calories a day. As your mom to buy you some sugar free jello, that stuff only has 10 calories per container. Your mom will see you eating and she'll be happy. Bring your own lunch to school. Pack a salad with tomatos, carrots, low fat cheese, and low fat dressing.

Studies have shown that people who eat bigger meals at breakfast are more successful in losing weight. Not eating can cause headaches, dizziness, weakness, feeling unwell - all symptoms of your blood sugar dropping. Its not fun. Plus when you starve yourself your body will crave sugar the most & when you do eat you will end up pigging out. Lastly, when you do not have food in your system your metabolism gets slower & slower. Then next time you eat it will be incredibly slow & will take awhile to get faster thus you'd be putting on more weight. The BEST thing you can do it eat regularly! What you need to watch is what you eat. You HAVE to cut out junkfood. You have to commit to only having healthy things around. Eat 5 smaller meals a day instead of 3. Like I said, eat bigger breakfasts. Also, drinking ice cold water signals your body to work harder to bring up the temp of the water thus burning more calories. I'm at a healthy weight but whenever I just constantly drink water I always lose weight!|`|kZTFKLBQaa	Yes, there is something wrong with eating nothing.  It is very damaging to your body when it is not supplied with the nutrients it needs to survive.  I am advising you to steer away from the whole "not eating" thing because I have done it myself, and it sucks to have to pay for the consequences later.  The healthy attitude to go about tackling your weight gain is to eat smaller portions 5x a day and to exercise.      I really hate the word exercise, so I think of it as de-stressing.  I prefer activities that dont have me stuck to a treadmill or elliptical such as Zumba (so much fun!) and workout DVDs.  I hope this helps.  Please re-consider the whole "starving" yourself thing b/c it's gonna come back to you and it's not gonna be pretty ... even doing it a short period of time will do damage to your body.  Good luck.
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...

It works great as long as I don't take it too often. Pretty much just take it on Friday nights, that way I can perform most the weekend. It gives more flexibility than viagra. Viagra doesn't last as long and you get an erection if you want to or not. Cialis just makes it easier to get it up (keep it up) when you are aroused.    I have never tried the over the counter stuff. I can see why people use it though, viagra and cialis are expensive, even with insurance.    Hope this helped!

Just stop smoking weed. THC is fat soluble so things like drinking lots of water won't help you any. All you can really do is just wait.    My recommendation: A day or two before the test, go to the drug store and pick up an at home drug test kit. Take the test. If you pass it, no worries. If you don't, drink about 32 ounces of water, take a b complex vitamin and a creatine supplement an hour or two before the test. This will make your test look clean.     Of course, the above assumes that you have a urine test. If it's a hair test, you're screwed. If it's a blood or saliva test, they detection times are reduced and you have nothing to fear.

fMS1kDA2aa	If you're eyeball is red, then you poped a blood vessel in your eye and its no big deal, wont cause any harm, but if its the skin around you're eye, its prolly just irritated, but if it lasts a long time, idk, maybe your tear duct is infected|`|bS6RPi9saa	maybe but go to your doctor|`|4eLzY2hfaa	it could be nothing, or it could be as serious as a  torn, or detached retina.  see you ophthalmologist.

Fgz5xWxOaa	you mean UNcircumsized.  Its a lot more fun b/c there's loose skin to play with!  (and he won't need lube for handjobs.....just don't pull the skin back forcefully or too hard.    Ask him to show you what feels good, or tell you.  I'd always prefer that a partner ask what I like instead of just assuming.|`|AA10096628	There is no difference... once he whips it out, you'll know what to do... seriously... it's no creature from another planet or the one eyed blue lagoon monster.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you don,t have to pull the skin back unless you want to suck the tip and as for having sex, well you have sex the same as if they had been circumcised|`|K4zsztkRaa	There is a lot more to do with an uncircumcised penis. Just be gentle like you would a regular penis.  Having a foreskin makes a lot of things a lot easier. and better.  Just ask him what he likes. When you are giving him a hand job, use his skin, have his foreskin roll back and fourth over the head. With a ******** just move his skin back past the head but them move it back and fourth with your hand while you are doing your thing lol    -Connor|`|4arnbpUCaa	If he's "uncut" then he is NOT circumcised.    Its all the same, just pull the skin back first before oral. Sex will be the same.  Don't be afraid to tell him you're not very experienced with uncut. I'm sure he'll help guide you along!    The below website might also be interest to you:|`|Z9360MMxaa	You won't really have to do anything? Basically its the same as a circumcised penis except you won't have to pull back the foreskin. Basically... get it hard, slip it in?|`|ONRpcM82aa	Don't worry about it.  You should keep doing what you been doing.  However it is better to pull it back if you want to impress him because it is much more sensitive than those who are cut.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Just do what comes naturally - in oral you don't have to pull it back and hold it you can use it in what you're doing and slide it fowards and back. In hand jobs it slides up and down so you can do that in oral too you don't have to hold it back. But all guys have different preferences so just ask him what he prefers and stuff and he should help you out. You're lucky, it's better if the guy isn't circumcised.    Harriet|`|8f2aaJPiaa	wow.... your lame when they are circumcised it means they have that end little bit of skin cut off! Obviously you made a mistake in your discription read over it again|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Circumcised or not, its pretty much the same. I've been with both before, and I've never had to do anything different. Although its easier to give a guy a hand job if he's not circumcised because the extra skin makes it easier to glide. Don't worry about it, just go with the flow. It'll be fine.|`|AA10331437	I am uncircumcised and when a person does oral on me they usually like to involve the foreskin.  It is very very sensitive and oral stimulation with the tongue is extremely enjoyable so you don't have to pull the skin back unless he asks for it.  Don't worry about it because once you start he will be advising you what to do.  Have fun!!!|`|IgbcN87paa	Play with his foreskin in your mouth.   btw circumcised is when you're "cut".  "uncut" is uncircumcised.
q42HObbraa	I am 14 and just used my first tampon a couple days ago,Slender is what i used and i think its the smallest size.Apparently they have a juniors size but im pretty sure thats close to slender.I can now even wear regulars easily.Good Luck|`|h5xSfcT6aa	in the uk, they re called 'mini' or 'lites'. in the us, i think they re called 'slender' or 'mini'. it gives you an indication on the box anyway, it will say for light - medium flow, and usually has a picture of droplets to indicate what absorbency the tampon is.  xxx|`|8a416d7a9120dc7e86c907efa9323194aa	try the ones by o.b. they are really small|`|bm1rsts7aa	Slender or junior.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Mini, regular, super, super plus.

mfaEWZ1Faa	How old are you?     Maybe hemorrhoids?    If this persists longer than some days, you should see a doctor. Anal bleeding is never a good sign.
jRWYVZ5vaa	Call the doctor and tell him about the pain. He can suggest an over the counter anti-inflammatory like aspirin, or prescribe something if he thinks you need it. It takes quite a while for joint injuries to completely heal.
0UBhxlkNaa	I agree with that other guy.  I am in college and follow a work out plan created by a graduate wanting to be a trainer and he gave me different muscle groups for every day of the week.  You should definitely do cardio on the days that you have rest.  The leg training on fridays should be anerobic weight training for you legs.|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	thats a decent start....my current routine is M=Chest and Tri's, Tuesday=Back and Bi's, Wed=Legs and Shoulders, and then you repeat that thru saturday...I noticed you dont have shoulders in your routine...i would throw shoulders in with Legs on Friday...and then you need to have good compound exercises the main three are Bench,Squats, and Deadlifts....you do those every week and do them hard like 3 sets for 6-8 reps each set and youll start putting on a lot of good muscle...eat plenty tho...your body is going to resist putting on muscle because its been at its means for your whole life and it doesnt like moving out of that medium youve made for it...so 1 gram of protein per body pound atleast, drink plenty of water, eat chicken, eggs, oatmeal, vegetables, rice....stuff like that should put good lean muscle on you....and then after you get used to doing your routine you can find out what you like and then bump it up to working out 4 days a week, then 5, and maybe even 6...but make sure you youve been working out a long time and your body can take that kind of stress before doing that..good luck|`|HESpmdqAaa	its good for a start....... after doing arms.... you should awlays rest but you can do abs and leg muscles every day bc they are big muscles
niLvdq0Qaa	I would suggest that you make an appointment with you family doctor and let them know what is going on as well as your concerns and they will take it from there.  Good luck to you.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	Do you eat regular healthy meals?  Do you drink water?  Have you changed your diet in any way?  You have to think about all this, I think it it was cancerous, it would be blood and black due to dried blood.  You might want to check a doctor to make sure.|`|fvuEtkROaa	A change is always something of concern. Diet and lack of fluids need to be considered.  At 19, unless you have a strong family history of bowel cancer, cancer is low on the list of concerns, but it certainly is worth getting to your health care provider for an evaluation.  Good luck.|`|LnL2T4oIaa	GO TO A DOCTER! iv been seeing people ignore medical problems and ask people here what to do. if you do have cancer, instead of going to the doctor you asked a bunch of strangers. if somebody here convinces you that you don't and you do, you can die all because you didn't get a checkup.|`|r28rZWqLaa	It is unlikely that you have colon cancer at 19.  However, if you have a family history of early onset of the disease, then you should have it checked.  I assume since you mentioned "S" shaped bowel movements, you have been researching normal bowel movements.  Our bm's change throughout life, periodically.  Normally, cancer causes blood in the stool (stool appears black if bleeding comes from stomach/small intestines, dark red or brighter if in large intestine/colon).  If you are seeing bright red blood in the toilet water, the problem is likely a fissure/tear or hemorrhoids.  If diet is not to blame, and the problem continues, you should see your doctor.
YLYAo2zmaa	It depends, it can be painful if they are looking at ovarian cysts or endometriosis the same way sex can cause pains with these conditions, if you aren't having issues it should only cause a pressure like feeling.|`|lJAaBmlyaa	When i had mine it was very painful, but i also had a bleeding cyst on my ovary and i'm not sure if the pain was the procedure or the ultrasound poking the bleeding cyst.|`|2VtFVKCDaa	Nope. Feels kinda weird, but it doesn't hurt.|`|8a416d7a9120dc7e86c907efa9323194aa	no not at all it just feels really wet and just a slight pressure|`|U55NCXmUaa	i've had to do this many times due to fertility treatments.  you're positioned like you're going to get a pap smear, but instead of the speculum, they use a wand to do the ultrasound.  it's pretty long and narrow, but it doesn't hurt (it's funny because they put a condom over it).  you'll feel slight pressure, but if you're relaxed, you'll barely feel it.  you may want to bring a liner due to the gel.
SSxqabVuaa	No, you are not really fat. I have been told the average is 105. Do not do pills. You're in 6th grade your body has not fully developed. eat healthy meals 3 times a day at least. You may not have reached your growth spurt yet. I am not sure of the actual average weight, I would search Google. I would not listen to what people with no evidence have to tell you.|`|0muvYszmaa	not really Over weight is around 147 to 160 trust me i would know.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	wow-you should be at least 120!|`|duyN8ahBaa	It is advisable to work out regular basis , but many peoples founds it so tough for example me, so in that Case , i will recomonded a Pills i for get company name........but if you wanna can go their website who offers Free Trial Pills.........http://loosweightfree.com|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	*thinks* what do you do normally? do you move around, or do you sit down? what do you do with friends? watch TV and sit? or play something...     i'm not being mean here, but you could lose something, i mean, i'm only 5 feet and weigh 103... *again NOT trying to be mean*    do you do after school activities? like a school sport or play? or something that involves moving in some kinda way!     do something fun with friends, like going to an amusement park or something... just dont sit around....     just trying to help a little....|`|exf4OhPkaa	yea you are overweight i would suggest just eating better and working out with video's or something. You could also get involved in a sport.|`|OtiTiVDNaa	Dont worry!!!! thats not considered fat, you are healthy and not one of those scary stick figures, since you are really young at the moment i suggest you get into a sport you really like, lets say tennis, basketball, Karate, gymanastic etc.  Once you do decide which sport you like, be regular in playing it, belive me this will enhance your growth and will shape up your body in the best of ways, keeping it well toned.   Key is regularity     Good luck!|`|qrXgyQovaa	you are def overweight.. being only 5ft 1 you should weigh like 100-105 pounds|`|3Z9ve2reaa	I would suggest avoid eating after dinner.    Try eating healthy food and set some standards (i.e. walking for ten minutes per day), then award yourself something when you earn money. Buy jeans a size smaller purposely to give yourself motivation to reach your weight loss goals.    If you work at a fast-food place, DO NOT always eat their food (trust me), even if you hate to, try to find healthy choices like chili or wraps.    Best of luck,|`|dnmXybF5aa	you are overweight.  LOL YOU HAVE A JOB IN 6th GRADE? thats a lie. you don't have a full time job. get off your butt, get a life, run, stop eating chowder and twinkies.
GnNsNNHjaa	You probably won't have time for this, but pick up some Drysol (you can get it behind the pharmacy counter at Shoppers Drug Mart, Walmart, etc..). It's like an extra strength anti-perspirant. You're usually supposed to use it before bed, but I've used it during the day before and it's been fine (let it dry for about an hour before you put any tight clothing on, otherwise it will bleach the underarms). It'll stop you from sweating completely.|`|iTyLs2S6aa	Shave, put on deodorant, let it dry. and dont too much activity before the game|`|Px8urrAuaa	Be sure to shave, haha.  Uhm I'm in Volleyball, and I sweat a lot sometimes.  I've tried Certain Dri deodorant stuff, and it works really good.  You should check it out.  =]    Good-Luck with the cheering.
0TGpz08paa	I had a CT Scan and I got my results in 48 hours. You can call the place you got it done and ask what the waiting time for the results is. I'm sure they'll tell you.|`|fvuEtkROaa	In most radiology practices, CT scans are read that day or the following day. Typing up the report and getting it to your doctor usually takes a couple more days.  If it were my CT scan, I'd call now for the results.  Waiting is always the hardest part.  Good luck.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	it should only take a few days, I would bet your DR has the results already|`|kdSuwt8paa	Make an appointment to see your doctor.   He should have the results within a week.|`|9FIvoZQaaa	Usually 3-4 business days -- remember, there was a weekend between now and then.  It also depends on if they were waiting for comparison films. Some practices will hold off on reading films if they know recent films are available for comparison, and it takes time to have them sent from another facility.  I'd say a reasonable amount of time has passed, though, and it's time for you to get your results. Call your doctor today and ask for them. If they don't have them, call the clinic where your CT was done and request the results to be sent to your doctor ASAP.   Remember, in health care, "no news" does not mean "good news" -- it usually means paperwork as been lost in the shuffle.    Good luck to you!|`|lplW6lwqaa	This will vary from hospital to hospital i am afraid. The radiologist will look at your scan & dictate a report, this then goes to admin to be typed & then the report will be available for your Doctor. If your Dr is not based at the Hospital where you had the scan the report will take longer to reach him.   You will need to have an apt booked to discuss the results, no one will give results over the telephone.  Kidney pain is most often caused by infection, cancer of the kidney generally produces no pain or specific symptoms.
FrECDwHfaa	it could be you appendix. Contact your doctor ASAP|`|BNAzjSO1aa	I suggest that you consult a doctor and see the web site below the pain in appendicitis can be any where in the abdominal area so get it checked out ASAP
2q1XI0j9aa	yes, the body cant digest it right, which is why it is bad    there is bread that does not contain it, just look on the ingredients list of the package, i buy bread that doesn't contain it, but i can't remember what it is called off the top of my head|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	Try whole grain breads.  It's not like you're going to eat 4 pieces a day.  It won't kill you but it sure will make you fat, if you consume lots of foods with it in it.  You could also use a bread machine, that way you control what's in your bread.  Good Luck. Sounds like you're doing great taking care of yourself|`|2qPtGTNcaa	You have to get rid of the wheat bread if it contains high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS triggers the insulin response quicker than table sugar. This means it makes you crave more food even more so than just eating table sugar straight.|`|YQZoGNOYaa	The bottom line in weight loss is calories in 
sw2R5A9iaa	quit eating it, read labels, and see an allergist.
UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|2q1XI0j9aa	To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|iQJuEtH2aa	do not use Slim Fast . Read this book ... "I CAN MAKE YOU THIN " by Paul  McKenna ... its amazing!!!

AA10331437	I was exactly like you when I was your age.  It didn't cause me any long term damage.  However, I am now 63 and can tell you how I stopped doing this.  You need to be involved with a great deal of new interests--volunteer a lot, develop new hobbies, remove all and any porn, when and if strong thoughts and desires strike immediately change your mind and think about something else.  The main cause of you doing it so much is you have too much time on your hands or you expose yourself to situations in which causes you to want to do it--just don't go there ever!      If none of the above help, I suggest you get some form of counseling.|`|wfqh2bARaa	I think it's a self esteem issue.  Nothing more.

Under Question 9, "Can I use Plan B? for regular birth control?" it says the following: <br>  <br>  "If you have unprotected sex after taking Plan B?, it cannot protect you from getting pregnant." <br>  <br>  Under Question 10, "How often can I use Plan B??", it says in the second paragraph: <br>  <br>  "Plan B? doesn't provide long-term protection against future pregnancy—it only works to prevent this one incident."<br>  <br>  And in Question 13, "When do I start taking my regular birth control pills after Plan B??", it says:<br>   <br>  "It is recommended that a regular method of contraception be started immediately after Plan B?, since Plan B? does not reliably protect against pregnancy beyond the day it is used."<br>  <br>  So you'll either have to take it again or take your chances.|`|kLHw0RzZaa	you shouldn't have done it in the first place. and the next night at that. really dumb.|`|oeRQUq98aa	You're Not Pregnant.<br>  <br>  Answer My Questions =]

KOYC3XkJaa	First: do the cuts heal?<br>  Contrary to popular belief, scabs are not necessary for healing. If you keep a wound moist (which is what happens if you put cream and a bandage on it) scabs won't form, but the wound still heals.<br>  So, if your cuts heal, I wouldn't worry about the wounds not scabbing, especially if you usually bandage them.<br>  If however the wounds do not heal, then you have some sort of underlying health condition. Diabetes, heart disease, and poor circulation can all lead to slow wound healing.|`|UeMz0uEBaa	You may be diabetic, you should go by a doc an check that out.

lECmz3SEaa	3 meals a day, that has 10% or less fat. snack should be fruits|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  I haven't tried laxatives but this a good diet plan.<br>  Hope this helps~|`|YuPNVX9maa	Do not use laxatives. That is a common trick that many anorexics use, and you may loose weight at first, but the laxatives will wear down your bowel muscles, and i know it sounds disgusting, but you may have control issues when you're older.|`|RJdWIHR7aa	Do a water fast or juice fast. its easy but you just have to try and not eat :)|`|VtDnvmg4aa	Hey!

It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is..

Alternating workouts forces your body to burn calories faster. LOW INTENSITY EXERCISE....Your heart rate should not go above 70% of your maximum heart rate so that you will burn mostly fats instead of sugars.  <br>  <br>  Do not increase distance/intensity/duration in any combination by more than 5-10% per week. You get stronger when your body is recovering so you should rest 1-2 days a week. Injury will be minimal and swimming helps sore muscles to recover faster. Reduce your caloric intake and more fruits and vegetables--junk food is a no-no. Easy cycling will burn the fat in the legs and calves. Swimming will burn fat and tone muscle. <br>  <br>  Look up the term glycemic index and try to eat foods that are high in complex carbs and complex sugars that are low on this index... e.g. instead of white potatoes eat sweet potatoes, whole grain bread instead of white bread. <br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: Make a schedule and stick to it. e.g. Monday Swim/run, Tues. Bike, Wed. Swim/run, Thurs. Bike, Fri. Swim/Bike, Sat. Show off 6-pack abs at pool. Sunday Show off 6-pack abs at pool.  Try to do at least 20-30min for each workout.<br>  <br>  Save your money and avoid supplements except for multivitamins. Your cost effective recovery drink is chocolate milk. (Milk is where whey protein supplements come from anyway).  <br>  <br>  It also helps motivate you if you sign up for a race or some kind of sports event. See you at the finish line.<br>  <br>  Get off the couch, stop drinking soda.<br>  <br>  P.S. This method takes a bit longer but it is PERMANENT.  Laxatives are only good till your next meal....and they can dehydrate you and ruin your electrolytic balance.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I think this sounds more like borderline than like bipolar - I was diagnosed borderline briefly, but I do not have abandonment issues or that "emptiness" feeling, and I do maintain good relationships when I am not symptomatic. Now that I am older, the bipolar is actually worse, not better.  On the other hand, borderline does often get better as people get older (but bipolar stays the same or gets worse).  Also, with bipolar, a really defining characteristic is the massive changes in the amount of sleep someone needs - like 14 hours or MORE when depressed, maybe 2 hours when manic, or 4-6 hours if they only get hypomania (and this is not insomnia, what I am saying is this is all the sleep they need or want).<br>  <br>  <br>  There is some issue with labelling people borderline when really they have PTSD from long term abuse - google complex PTSD for more info on that.  The best treatment for borderline that has been found so far, and it is supposedly VERY effective, is DBT, dialectical behavior therapy. You may be eligible for free help from your county's social services department, because in most states, anyone with schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression, or borderline is eligible for help if they need it.<br>  <br>  I was sexually abused over many years too, and these kinds of symptoms you are talking about are all mixed in with bipolar symptoms, and it is a daily hell, so I know what you are going thru & am sorry you have to go thru it.  What I have learned about relationships with others is you have to keep a lid on it, you have to control your behavior, because that is all that others can observe about you. If you lash out at others, you will ruin relationships. You need to analyze why you lost control, and work hard at fixing that problem, and also apologize sincerely and often, as soon as you calm down.<br>  <br>  I really think you should check with your county and see if you are eligible for a free Dialectical Behavior Therapy class.  Also, someone else gave me this link when I asked a question - dbtselfhelp.com.  I haven't tried it yet. There is also free computerized cognitive behavioral therapy at moodgym.anu.edu.au.  Other programs that were studied were found to be almost as good as a therapist. The DBT is really the way to go for borderline, though.  Also, check if there are sexual assault non-profit organizations offering free counseling.  I am very rural, and we have that here, so I bet you do, too.

First off, why are you hellbent on needing another disorder? During my years in the psychiatric system I learned that these are just labels for billing purposes. A group of psychs got together and made a show of hands to decide which disorder is which. I would say if you are worried about having more problems you should revisit your psych. You didn't say when you last went so maybe now is a good time to go. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what kind of reassurance I can give you. It seems the only people who can give that kind of compassion are the people close to you. If I were to tell you that everything would be okay and just peachy then I would be a liar because I honestly don't know. <br>  <br>  The only certainty that I know especially when dealing with mental illness is to take it one day at a time. That is really all you can do.
cb2NxPERaa	Due to some people's ignorance, you will get some stupid answers in this question, like "eat plenty of fast food". Don't listen to them. Fast food is full of so many bad fats. If you want to gain weight, you'll have to do it with good fats. Also eat a lot of protein, eliminate cardiovascular, and doing some muscle building exercises to gain mass wouldn't hurt. Anyways, here are the list of the good fats:<br>  olive, canola, and sesame oils<br>  avocado<br>  nuts, such as almonds, cashews, and pistachios; peanuts and peanut butter<br>  corn, cottonseed, and safflower oils<br>  sunflower seeds and sunflower oil<br>  flaxseed and flaxseed oil<br>  soybeans and soybean oil<br>  tub margarine<br>  seafood|`|FNeCDm3raa	The same way you got the muscle before.

Apply to skin.Leave on for at least 20 minutes then rinse with warm water, followed by a moisturizer of natural margarine or natural vegetable oil.<br>  <br>  -Apply natural mayonnaise, either homemade or from natural foods store.Massage into skin, leave on for 15-20 minutes,rinse thoroughly with warm water.<br>  <br>  -Grate the rind of one whole lemon into 4 tablespoons plain yogurt.Mix and rub over entire body concentrating on the driest patches.

8OqdoIHtaa	Hypoglycemia is a condition where your blood sugar drops below normal ranges. I had this condition for over 10 years, then gradually became a type 2 diabetic. The same thing happened to my mother. We are now both on insulin. <br>  <br>  Since your A1c level is rising, I think it's quite likely that the same thing could happen to you. <br>  <br>  Eventually, the low blood sugar will stop and your blood sugar will be high all the time, unless its treated. One way is to eat low carb. <br>  <br>  To keep your blood sugar even, stop eating sugar and white rice, white flour, white pasta, white bread, baked goods, cookies, cake, candy and all that yummy stuff. Get rid of all of it. <br>  <br>  ALL grain products must be whole grain and you shouldn't eat a lot them. Stick with smaller servings of whole grain products. <br>  <br>  Eat more low carb foods, lean meat, and avoid fruit juice, pop, and all processed carbs. <br>  <br>  Try to keep your carbs under 30 for each meal. If you are eating every 2 hours, have only 15 or 20 carbs per mini meal. <br>  <br>  Try the South Beach diet maintenance phase. You can probably borrow the book from your library. You don't want to go really low carb, but you can use the recipes in it to makes some lower carb meals that you can have. <br>  <br>  Get a blood sugar meter and some test strips and see how foods affect you. You can learn about testing here... <br>  <a href="http://www.diabetic-talk.org/jennifer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetic-talk.org/jennifer.ht...</a><br>  <br>  For sweetening, use Splenda or Stevia. Do not use sugar or honey, both are bad for hypoglycemia and diabetics.<br>  <br>  When your blood sugar is low, do not eat sugar or glucose, fruit or anything sweet. It will make your blood sugar rise too quickly, trigger an insulin release and then you'll come down too quickly again. <br>  <br>  Instead, have some WHOLE grain bread with butter or peanut butter, or any other nut butter. Or some whole grain crackers and cream cheese. You need a combination of whole grains and protien or fat or both. About 15 to 20 carbs are enough to deal with a low. Don't overdo it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2eQlSoY1aa	I, as usual, agree with Noccie.  You are not a diabetic if your HbA1C and sugars are perfectly normal. Also, hypoglycemia is not a disease or condition but rather just a symptom of a poor diet or something of that sort.  You need to do some research and request some education from your endocrinologist.|`|qmk2mIKpaa	The borderline diabetic makes no sense...hypoglycemia is its own condition as well...and just eat something at work brainiac...go to the vending machine|`|ZNbauLJzaa	It makes absolutely no sense to be borderline diabetic (high blood sugars) with hypoglycemia (low blood sugars).  White rice is absolutely loaded with carbohydrates, so you shouldn't be low.  You really need to work with an endocrinologist to determine if you have either hypoglycemia and if you have that what is causing it.  Hypoglycemia is a symptom of something, it is not a disease or condition and it is extraordinarily rare to happen in someone who does not take insulin for diabetes.  Your liver should have enough stored sugar that you should be able to function for more than two hours without passing out.<br>  Perhaps you are completely wrong about what ails you.  Maybe it's not a sugar issue at all.  Perhaps you have some form of vertigo, or low blood pressure, or blood pressure that dips down when you get up?|`|ohl9XRYzaa	Diabetes and hypoglycemiaa are not the same thing. Diabetics can have high and low blood sugars and hypoglycemics have only low blood sugars. If your blood sugar is so low you feel you are going to pass out, if you don't already have a blood glucose meter to check your blood sugars you should find out if your insurance will the cover the cost and ask your Doctor to prescribe one.<br>  If you are working when you have a low take 1/2 cup orange juice or 1/2 cup regular soda or get sugar tablets for this purpose at the drug store and take 4 or them for a quick rise in sugars. Good Luck!
cSqx1DxKaa	It's a way of relieving internal stress and negative feelings.  Some people don't know how to let those feelings go, and they get urges to turn them inward, perhaps even as a kind of self-punishment, and they end up hurting themselves.  It's a terrible urge (I won't call it a "habit" since it's not) to break.  She needs some help to overcome it or else it might plague her for years.<br>  <br>  I very much disagree with the people who say that people self harm in order to get attention.  On the contrary, I think most self harmers would be delighted if they knew there was a way to hide their scars so that no one would find out what they were up to.  It can be embarassing or stressful to them if someone confronts them about their self-harm.  Please don't view your friend as attention-seeking, because I really don't think that's what the problem is here.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	IMO...people do this for a number of reasons...no way out and attention are a couple. <br>  <br>  She and her family needs counseling because there seems to be a serious communication problem in that household.|`|3sszFQd5aa	Cutting is a way that some people, who have no other outlet for emotional issues, use to get the pain out or feel something. I used to be a cutter, and I would deface my skin when times were tough or I thought I had no one to talk to. This is a sign of a serious problem that is starting to manifest itself.<br>  <br>  Your friend needs to seek professional help before this becomes a bigger problem. You and her parents can support her in getting help, but you cannot give her the experienced guidance she needs right now. The best thing you can do for her is to try and get her to voluntarily see a doctor.<br>  <br>  I worry about the fact that she chose her wrists to cut on. Even if she is not suicidal, she may accidentally cut too deeply and get herself in a very bad situation. Talk to her, support her, but most of all, get her professional help. It is what she needs right now before this grows into a bigger problem.<br>  <br>  Follow the links below for more information and places to go for support.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	She has a problem, she needs a doctor.
AA10045887	It's hard to know how you managed to scratch it, but but some antiseptic on it and leave it alone and it will heal on it's own. When it does, you will be able to continue to masturbate and have sex etc. Just be careful with finger nails, zippers and anything that can scratch your penis, that includes teeth.|`|sCCjAKllaa	It could come from excessive sessions of that same process.

AA10450066	If your having pain it's a sign that your over doing the exercise reps.Turn it back a little and work your way up.Pain is telling you that there's something wrong, it's not to be ignored.In so far as to what you should eat is a well balanced diet high in protein.The muscles you are using are around the sternum area and will feel like your heart may be affected, but that's normal.I'm not sure what Mg is but as long as you take a multivitamin and eat properly you should be covered.There is such a thing as taking too many vitamins.|`|g8qHXXxtaa	Ignore that - Pain is not good. It tells you its damaging or about to damage your body and you should slow down.<br>  <br>  Nothing mate - it's normal to get muscle pains after exercising. <br>  <br>  As for MG its nothing to do with your muscle pain as such.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't have gotten pain in your heart. i know what you mean but its the muscle around the heart mate.|`|NCmDeklwaa	Drink plenty of plain water and eat at least one organic banana a day. <br>  Make sure your eating enough protein.  :)|`|r5wK05N5aa	Pain is good!

eA8yShNsaa	There is nothing wrong with not fearing death.  Death is a natural part of life. However, if you find yourself welcoming death, hoping for it, or having suicidal thougts even occasionally, then get counseling. There may be a link between your bouts with depression and your apathy toward death. Very subtle but probably worth discussing with a trained counselor or psychologist.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	every one dies, today or the day after today... just keep trying to experience new new things, dont think about death, but remember it, to always do Good deeds!|`|jokLZE5paa	no you have prob just overcome your fear.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  please answer!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	No death is nothing to fear you know its part of the natural order and have accepted it, good for you!|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	No. There is nothing wrong with that.

1oBilGHuaa	It might be something as simple as a certain sound outside that is loud enough to wake you up, a neighbor's car engine starting up, or a dog barking.  If someone lives above you, their big feet walking on your ceiling could wake you up.  This is what sometimes wakes me up.  I hope you have restful sleep.  Good Luck.
fR2Geezcaa	From size 36 to size 5-6! I lost over 100 lbs and have kept it off for over 10 years now. It took me almost two years. I did it all by changing my "lifestyle" (eating habits and a little exercise). I did NOT join a gym but did get a treadmill and an exercise bike at the beginning, haven't been on either in years now I must admit. I walk a lot and still do a little bit of yoga for stretching and to keep my back strong.<br>  <br>  When ever I tried to diet and do the gym thing, any weight I took off always came back. I finally learned it was a matter of changing your lifestyle. I eat six small meals a day and just watch all carb's and sugar's. I still do have pasta's and bread's, I just watch how much and make sure the portion of pasta is the smallest potion on my plate. <br>  <br>  When it does comes to exercise, I do a lot of walking/hiking and simply don't take the easy way out on things. I don't look for the closest parking spot, if it snows I shovel and only use the snow blower if the snow is so deep I can't physically remove it. When gardening in the summer I pay attention to how I squat down, lean forward and lift bags of dirt ( I don't use the wheel-barrow). I stay as active as I can. I have never felt better in my life!|`|2RzEaod9aa	I lost about 100lbs and I did it in about 10 months. Just regular exercise and proper eating.

I'm 125 and holding now.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	I lost almost 150 lbs with changing my diet and adding exercise (both resistance training and cardio).  It took me about a year and a half to lose everything.|`|RJdWIHR7aa	No i haven't but if you go on youtube there are people that have and they have videos that tell you how they did it.|`|PuV9lh37aa	Me|`|9KvPyqNraa	I have! I am still the in the process of getting to 100 pounds.<br>  This May it will be 2 years since I've started.<br>  I started with Atkins and then got onto a more healthy diet (Atkins works for a while, but then when it messes up it really messes up)<br>  What I really want to say is that your plan has to be moderate and reasonable so that you dont end up hating it. I walk a few times a week after dinner and eat low fat/low cal. Ocassional hike in the woods. I highly recommend Alli, google it, it worked for me because I already had the discipline to not cheat and sometimes I dont take one and have a good night out.

In addition to the cardio, you'll want to incorporate some weight training excercises to help you build muscle. A circuit training program is great, whereby you start with a 5 minute cardio warm up, then move to do one set on a series of about 10 weight machines, do another 5 minutes of cardio, then another run through the 10 weight machines, then finish with 20 minutes of cardio.<br>  <br>  Also, high intensity classes are great. Boot Camp programs are amazing for burning calories and weight loss.

Morning I wake up I have high fiber cereal with a banana Get to work.. then have a cereal bar with water.. Lunch time comes I have the most carb meal at this time.. Pasta with chicken.(it changes every day) then shortly after if i feel to snack i have yoogurt with the rolled oats .. I get home after work and thne I have a spinnach salad with chicken and all the veggies i like with a few pieces of chedder cheese and a .  shortly after I go for a work out .. thenif i feel for a snack i have a cucumber.  I mean a whole one to make me full. I know it sounds like a lot but I just had a baby exactly 10 months ago and thsi diet worked for me.. I made it up on my own and it workes.. I can still EAT food but just not fried and I dont cook with oil at all... Hve your high Carbs before dinner time and  you will have to excercise 4-5 times a day.  Now I exercise .. but i mean 20-25 min on the eliptical.. 20 min weight train and then maybe a long bath after to losen the muscles.  You will be sore for a while if you are doing a GOOD workout....One more thing to know is that it helps when you have your husband and or a special close friend to help you out and build your confidence.  it just makes it more special and meaningful if you know what i mean.

Um75aRZFaa	Zyrtec (Cetirizine) is a very affective over the counter antihistamine you can get at any drug store now. It used to be prescription only. You can also take Mucinex (guaifenesin) in the morning and Mucinex D (guaifenesin and pseudoephedrine) at night to help with the stuffy nose. It helps drain the mucus from your nose and ears. <br>  <br>  The drug names in parenthesis are the generic brand drug names, just look for those on the labels when you go to the pharmacy or walmart. It will save you a few dollars if you get the generics and they are just as affective.<br>  <br>  Try those for a few weeks and if things don't clear up, go to your doctor and get a prescription for a stronger antihistamine and decongestant. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|cn91FeWcaa	mucinex<br>  benadryl<br>  allegra<br>  breath right strips<br>  steam<br>  nose and mouth mask...that doctors wear

GbzxnGcIaa	Well,it is true that any products that contain salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide could harm an unborn child if this compound come in contact with the baby itslef.However,if you use products such as creams that you apply externally,it wouldn't cause any harm to your child so there's no need for you to woory about it.However,if you take products where you consume internally,then you should stop taking those since it will harm your baby's health.Plus,if you're taking any oral antibiotics for acne,you should stop taking them since it will pose a risk to yourself and your baby.However,if you just apply products on your skin,you'll do just fine.Hope I helped(:<br>  <br>  P/s:Go seek help from your doctor if you want since there is no guarantee though about this.It would be easier that way.Good luck!!|`|5LpE3KdUaa	Stop Now, and have a talk with your doctor.
CMC9VVMqaa	ever tried any herbs like Echinacea, Licorice....licorice reduces coughing, soothes your respiratory tract and enhances your immune system...only take it short term cause it can pull potassium out of your system<br>  Astragalus is good for chronic cough cause it strengthens your lungs, but don't take if you have a fever<br>  Also look up Cherry Bark.. very good for a wet cough<br>  <br>  If you don't like herbs there's vitamin c, garlic, bromelain and vitamin A<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if any of these have any interactions with drugs and I am not a doctor, so you will have to research each of these on your own to find out how much you can take, these are only some suggestions

7e4580c39089e9616fbf69fee3559743aa	Sometimes periods can be missed for no apparent reason, but that doesn't mean anything serious is up with your body. One of the reasons you may miss a period is your hormonal balance becoming upset - often this is due to stress or worry. Even something like worrying about the absence of your period could delay it further - the body is very sensitive. Also an event such as a holiday, house move or job change could result in a missed period. Other causes could be rapid weight gain/loss, periods of self-starvation or aggressive exercise. When the body is aware that it is not receiving the nutrition it needs to be healthy, your periods may stop as a way of holding on to essential nutrients that would otherwise be lost in the menstrual blood.<br>  <br>  All you can do is wait and try not to stress about it, as this will not help. Try to think of reasons why you may have missed your period - have you been ill recently? Is something worrying you? Have you been taking a new kind of medication lately or changed your schedule? All these things can and do mess up your cycle. <br>  <br>  Remember that most women will have a delayed or missed period at some point in their lives and generally menstruation resumes at the next due date. If you miss more than three periods, you should consult your doctor. Good luck.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	see below - causes of missed periods and irregular periods|`|Fc5wU2R1aa	Have you recently lost weight? Are you dieting now? The female body needs a certain amount of body fat to maintain a healthy pregnancy. If you're too skinny your body knows it couldn't be pregnant successfully and will stop periods for that reason.|`|NZoHMFryaa	Some women simply have irregular periods, fasting or low weight can cause one to miss a period, as well as illness, stress, and numerous other circumstances.<br>  <br>  OTOH, I would get another pregnancy test, too, the one from the dollar store may be old. Best to check twice, just to be sure.<br>  <br>  Wishing you good health and happiness!|`|u8pdRkcZaa	If I were you I would see your doctor - she/he can do a pregnancy test for you that will  be accurate.  Sometimes the store tests do not read accurately.  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you have been under stress that could be another reason for a missed period.
goY0JHzlaa	Ok, ok,ok....before everyone gives this man an automatic death sentence, know what you are talking about first. <br>  First, it depends on the type of cancer, then the stage. Staging is another way of stating wether the cancer is in one spot only, where the spot is, and if it has spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. Some cancers are fast growing and some are slow. This plays a big part in choosing what type of chemo is used. Or if it's operable,or if radiation can be used. SOme times 1 is used  or others use a combination of surgery, chemo, or radiation. And not in this particular order. SOme cancers are surgically removed. Others, surgery can not be preformed, but, radiation or chemo is used instead. It's very complex and it is always different for everyone. Some people survive for another 8 years or so after diagnosis. Others, it happens very quickly. The best thing to do is talk with your grandpa and find out what his doctors are telling him what his options are. Do not give up hope. Cancer treatment has come a long way. And they are finding out differents to treat it with good results. <br>  <br>  I know this to be true. I went through this with my dad. Believe me, your grandpa may repsond favorably to his treatment and go into what we call remission where the cancer is contained. If it can be contained, patients can go on an live their lives. Unfortunatley, it does sometimes come back. And then, you start the whole process over again. The point I'm trying to make here is.....just because he has this diagnosis, does not mean he is going to die right away. You don't know that yet and neither do these other people on this board. Good luck and I wish you and your grandpa the best in these tough times.|`|voD8gnmcaa	it all depends. his oncologist probably told him because if it was in a late stage he would only have a few monthes left...so because he hasnt (due to ur question) im sure he has awhile left. it just depends on his overall health besides cancer and if he exercises daily...it also depends if he was a smoker...just talk to his oncologist and i am very sorry he has cancer =[ i have a ton of family history of cancer in my family and its a terrible thing to watch<br>  <br>  just spend as much time w him as possible !|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Don't wrap him in cotton wool - let him live whatever length of life he has to the full.<br>  My Dad had Ca Bronchus and his one regret was that he'd left it too late to visit Thailand and see the orchids.<br>  His Doc is the one to tell you the probable prognosis.|`|TrrVqO0haa	sorry to say but he wont have to long a few months at best he doesnt stand much chance o getting threw cancer at that age but there is always a chance but im afraid he wont have to long|`|Sxd0tXDwaa	not long|`|AA11599407	Depends on type of cancer, oat cell vs small cell, the stage he is in, his overall health, what treatments he is willing and able to take etc. Too many variables but this is a terminal illness.

JN6LWA6Oaa	For me two hours is too long. For me, the 30 min window is after each group, If I work two groups in a day I take half a scoop after each group. What I do is finish a group and take the half a scoop IMMEDIATELY after then go on to the other group and take the other half IMMEDIATELY. As soon as you put the last weight down, your shake should be ready for you to chug it down. The faster you get it in you the better. But yeah two hours is way to long, why so long, what are you planning on doing?|`|2RzEaod9aa	It depends on your goals. 2 hours is waaaayyy too long for me, but that's because I punish myself quickly with heavy weights so I can add size and quick strength. <br>  <br>  The point of the post workout shake is to refuel. I take mine after I'm done with the workout completely, even if I follow up weights with cardio...I drink it on my way out.|`|6K1D6Azmaa	If you are a powerlifter, you should probably do a 2 hour workout that just blasts you once a week. If you lift light, you do more sets and may require less recovery time. It's up to your body how fast your recover and how quickly you build strength. You should keep a notebook to make sure you are keeping on track to your goals. If your recovery or strength start slipping, you might be pushing yourself too hard. ?|`|tIldpr7vaa	2hrs is too long, you're either over working ur muscles or just taking too many long breaks in between exercises ( about 45 sec between sets and about 2 mins between exercises), or both. No more than an hour.<br>  <br>  Its best to take your post workout shake right after u work out to be most effective. Just take it after ur whole workout when you're done, not in between muscle groups.|`|eNq3DOWmaa	2 hours actually isnt that long you can get everything u want done in 2 hours..if you are a weight lifter, an hour would not completely cut the cheese because you wouldnt be able to get everything done in that time...so i would say about and hour and a half to 2 hours long is good|`|PZ9OSv9naa	2 hours is fine for a workout.  Take your shake as soon as you can after your workout. But don't stress over it.  If it takes you a little while before you get home to get in your shake its not really a big deal. But sooner is good.|`|MEgAS8H4aa	If you are taking a lot of breaks or talking a lot between sets 2 hours is okay, but if you want to get the most out of your workouts they should not take longer than an hour. Studies show that usable testosterone only lasts about 20 minutes at maximal intensity. So, in your case, you could do so warm-up exercises and then get into the "meat" of your workout. Train intensely, using super-sets and giant sets. If your workout still takes too long you should break it into single bodyparts.<br>  <br>  If you are taking too long to work out all of the nutrition you take in after the workout goes to replenish your body's energy stores and not to the muscles that need it.<br>  <br>  Take your drink after you have completed your workout. If you workout more than once per day then it is okay to drink more than one shake.<br>  <br>  Just remember, rest is just as important as working out.

Taking their fingers and pressing hard (but not too hard) back and forth across your forehead where the pain hurts.<br>  -You might be just lacking some food or energy, so (trust me on this one) try drinking gatorade. My mom had serious headaches before but that was because she was lacking nutrients. If your headache is really bad, you might be losing your energy, and gatorade has sugar, so it will make you feel better.<br>  -Try putting ice on your head, but I don't think that it would work that great.<br>  -Get a lot of sleep. Sleep helps a lot!<br>  <br>  And that is all that I can think of right now.

EMT-B units and paramedics along with first responders should be able to dress and bandage woulds that are externally visible.

l7GjBVvhaa	When men go for their physicals their prostates are checked by the doctor each time. This is the reason for the doctor inserting a finger into the rectum and feeling the size of the prostate. If the doctor suspects anything then he will order more tests.<br>  <br>   Usually if the patient has a history of prostate cancer in the family he should pay more attention to it. Men with prostate cancer generally have no symptoms, especially in the earliest stages. This is why the screening is so important each and every time.<br>  <br>  Men should practice lifestyle young so keep their prostates healthy. The best way to do this may be through the diet. Men should consume large amounts of lycopene. Foods that contains this are; tomatoes, ketchup, watermelon, and grapefruit.<br>  <br>  Another way to approve the health of the prostate is through regular prostate milking. This refers to giving a massage to the prostate in order to cause it to ejaculate seminal fluid. Someone must put on a lubricated glove, insert their fingers into your rectal area, find the prostate, and gently stroke it along its sides. This will usually cause the prostate to initiate semen ejaculation and male orgasm, though it does not happen every time. Another reason as a man becomes more sexual aware of his body and what he enjoys, he enjoys anal play. :0)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you......|`|oknrKiOMaa	any age.... but I think its after 40.

If there are no signs of an out break then your risk of getting herpes would be small also if they are using some kind of suppressive therapy then your risk is even further reduced.<br>  As long as he is being honest about telling you when his out breaks are coming and you don't have sex then you are pretty safe. There is only a small chance that herpes can be passed on even when there are no signs of an out break.<br>  Don't mean to scare you but some people with herpes don't experience symptoms for months or years after contracting it so you may want to get your self tested for herpes regularly to be on the safe side.|`|crrK58F4aa	Generally speaking you can only contract genital herpes when the person is having an outbreak and has the blistery sores on their skin.<br>  <br>  If you had contracted it you would have had an outbreak very shortly after contracting it, so within 7-10 days.<br>  the first outbreak is most often the worst. If you are experiencing any itching and discomfort go and see the doctor because they can prescribe you medication, usually Valtrex, which will lessen the symptoms and shorten the length of the outbreak.<br>  <br>  So it is possible that if in 2 years you never came in to any contact with the sores that you don't have it.|`|nAAF3OHAaa	Poppy is right. It is very possible that you have unprotected sex with an infected person and still do not contract it. The risk of transmission is the highest when the person has outbreak. If there is no outbreak, the chance is very low.<br>  <br>  Remember, there is always a chance even if your partner does not have outbreak. BUT it is not very likely. Even if you contract herpes from him, you are going to join a very large number of people who have HSV-2 (more than 20% in north america). <br>  <br>  I hope it helps.

Even though it is in their system, they may not have the actual blisters, which she said are painful, so they don't won't to pass it since it's easier when there is a blister present. They are married and only having sex with each other. Be sure that your friend and their partner are monogamous and not sleeping around which could lead to other STDS.|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	me and my partner have it i infected him a year after being with him  i didn't know till then i had it..so as we both have it we dont practice safe sex as we cant catch it again if he has an outbreak then obviously it to painful to have sex and would delay the healing process.<br>  hope that helps.

NqfUPKiSaa	Pl visit a doctor and get treated for stuffed nose|`|AA12156890	* If you're overweight, lose weight. Being overweight is a common cause of snoring. Loose throat tissues are more likely to vibrate as you breathe, and extra bulkiness in the throat narrows your airway.<br>      * Sleep on your side. Lying on your back allows your tongue to fall backward into your throat, narrowing your airway and partially obstructing airflow. To prevent sleeping on your back, try sewing a tennis ball in the back of your pajama top.<br>      * Nasal strips. Adhesive strips applied to your nose help many people increase the area of their nasal passage, enhancing their breathing.<br>      * Treat nasal congestion or obstruction. Having allergies or a deviated septum can limit airflow through your nose. This forces you to breathe through your mouth, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Don't use an oral or spray decongestant for more than three days in a row for acute congestion unless directed to do so by your doctor. Ask your doctor about a prescription steroid spray if you have chronic congestion. To correct a deviated septum, you may need surgery.<br>      * Limit or avoid alcohol and sedatives. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages at least four hours before bedtime, and let your doctor know about your snoring before taking sedatives or hypnotics. Sedatives and hypnotics (sleeping pills) and alcohol depress your central nervous system, causing excessive relaxation of muscles, including the tissues in your throat. In addition, if you stop breathing due to obstructive sleep apnea, it may take longer for you to begin breathing again because alcohol, sedatives and hypnotics blunt the brain's ability to arouse from sleep.|`|TuGkVqwraa	Stop Breathing <br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  <br>  Use Silencer.|`|AA11707529	what exactly are you talking about?

R02vAa48aa	According to this article (see attached link) you should freeze your fish before eating it raw to kill any parasites...|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Well actually I know everyone thinks sushi is raw but its not, it really is cooked.  Its sashimi that's the raw stuff.  But I do think you should look up online stuff on how to make your own sashami from fresh fish.|`|zwPDe1N5aa	Wrong Wrong Wrong.  Some sushi is cooked but this guy is referring to the raw kind (which there is).  No you don't freeze it... Freezing does not kill some parasites.  If you believe that then I dare you to freeze a chicken breast then thaw it and eat it raw...<br>  If you're concerned with contamination, start with washing your hands... they're dirtier than the fish meat.  You can literally eat meat right off the fish.  That's how the restaurants get them.  Ask any survivalist, sushi chef, someone who isn't ignorant.  Hawaiian was dead on...|`|6b7KFgtpaa	Depends on what kind of fish.  If it is a sushi fish then yes... cut and eat.  Just don't rinse it, pH differences in the water denatures the meat proteins and alters the flavor.|`|dtwkBXv3aa	lol maybe cleaning it before making sushi is a good idea =]|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	pretty much cut it and gut it rap in seaweed and go for it|`|c3IXjK26aa	I would be careful because I've heard even sushi sold in stores can sometimes be contaminated. I would try, as you said, rinsing it well with water. I don't know what else you could do, maybe if you add a little salt to the water you rinse it with that might help kill bacteria & things. <br>  <br>  I guess it would all depend on whether you trust the water where you caught the fish to be relatively unpolluted. Also just to be on the safe side, you might want to check online to see what the mercury levels are for the kind of fish you caught. <br>  <br>  I also refer you to my source below for someone else's opinion about sushi. It's the 7th answer down by someone named "jeeves".
RHs6m2dmaa	The symptoms of diabetes may develop extremely quickly (over the course of weeks or even days) in children or adolescents who had previously been exhibiting signs of health. <br>  <br>  However, in adults over the age of 40 the symptoms can appear very gradually. <br>  <br>  In type 1 diabetics, a condition called ketoacidosis is common. This occurs when acid compounds (ketones) form in the blood. If untreated, this can result in extremely serious complications and even death, but it can be the first indicator of the presence of type 1 diabetes. <br>  <br>  Amongst type 2 diabetics, the condition may not be picked up on until the patient comes in for other medical treatment.

5rJ6nf2oaa	Actually it binds oxygen and carbon monoxide. The normal role of haemoglobin is to carry oxygen in the blood and release it to the tissues, however it binds carbon monoxide a lot better than oxygen and this is why carbon monoxide poisoning leads to death because it binds in preference to oxygen.<br>  <br>  However this is not the normal function of haemoglobin so the correct answer is D.|`|kTxYJQPoaa	Answer is D - the hemoglobin becomes oxyhemoglobin after it bonds to the oxygen.|`|Adhkt73maa	Hemoglobin binds oxygen to a red blood cell.

That is what I thought.<br>  I come from a smoking family. We all smoke. I started getting puffs around age 4 and was a regular smoker by 7, but some of my cousins started younger. One of my cousins started getting puffs when she was just a baby, and was a regular smoker at 3. She is 40 now, still healthy, and still smoking. I have 3 daughters and let them smoke as much as they want.<br>  In my mom's day, newspapers used to show pictures of little kids who smoked, especially if they were heavy smokers or smoked cigars. These kids grew up just fine, too. It could even be that kids who are exposed to firsthand smoke develop a resistance to it, and are healthier! Babies who are given puffs of smoke and learn to inhale them without coughing are at LESS risk of SIDS than other kids - did you know that? It is because they develop the ability to consciously control their breathing, and it is autonomic breathing control issues that causes SIDS.<br>  <br>  It is cute - admit it!|`|7vqIoUAKaa	it's repulsive. people shouldn't be smoking let alone children! what the hell is wrong with these ppl!|`|goY0JHzlaa	Child Abuse.

cb2NxPERaa	There's no such thing as fast abs. Abs will take you at least 3 months. 80% of abs is a good diet. So eat a good diet and drink at least 8 glasses a day. For exercises, do crunches, every day for at least 15 minutes and do daily cardiovascular activity.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|p9Ku6RKOaa	Well, here are a few things.<br>  1.)

4uike3ARaa	On a regular basis, approximately 17-18 hours.<br>  <br>  When I was much, much younger, as part of a ceremony, I went without sleep or food for almost 100 hours. Water was allowed.

Run up again and bring me the right one." Stuff like that. By the end of the second day I was beginning to hallucinate. By the third day, feelings of hunger passed and I 'got my second wind.'

If it is, tell your Dad, in Peyronie's disease a plaque or lump forms on the penis and it can make the penis bend or arc during erection. Your Dad can help you make the determination to take you to a doctor. I suspect you are mistakenly seeing an arc where there is only a slight up swing. Teen agers can be very critical of themselves|`|bZ99fJVdaa	It's supposed to curve upward.  I really doubt you have Peyronie's disease -- it usually only strikes men older than 55.

znjl6WrWaa	try to make an effort not to smoke more because you know you're going to quit monday. If you smoke more frequently you'll have more of a dependency. Try to wait an hour or two when you have a craving. That way you're giving your body signals that it won't get nicotine right away. Also stock up on gum, hard (sugar-free preferably) candy, and lost of crunchy veggies. A lot of people gain weight when they quit smoking so try to keep your hands and mouth occupied at the same time. Write in a journal while snacking on celery for instance. <br>  <br>  Also get a good support group. Talk to friends and family and get their words of encouragement. For me it helped to look at a note my husband wrote for me when I got a craving. The note said that he was so proud of me and he loved that he didn't smell smoke on my clothes anymore. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|af2b8cb22a1ed77dda9500aaea60bf51aa	Congratulations on choosing to quit.<br>  <br>  Several suggestions on cold turkey: 1) you will wish to watch your blood sugar. Nicotine addiction changes the way your body deals with it. Buy some orange juice in case you feel low in blood sugar, 2) do not have any cigarettes around, 3) keep busy doing things you enjoy, 4) announce to the world you are quiting and that you will be a cranky for awhile.<br>  <br>  Finally, know that you will be uncomfortable for a few days, but it will eventually get better. The goal is to tough it out and then to look back on this coming Monday as a day of real victory against a demon.  A month or two from now you will be very proud of yourself if you really quit.|`|qaUmRFc8aa	Get out of the house, and go somewhere where smoking is not allowed.  An art gallery, the mall, a movie are all good places where you are already used to not smoking.

urCM5bP6aa	You're a warm-blooded animal, which means that your body temperature should always be in the 98.6 degree range. Your body should naturally feel air as cooler around you when it is, even at temperatures of 80 or 90 degrees. If you stop noticing the cool air around you, it is because you've become habituated to the cooler temperature; it is completely natural for you to feel "cold" whenever you're in any temperature below 98.6 degrees fahrenheit. Your body shivers so that you produce energy and raise your bodily "thermostat." Don't worry about it. If you're cold, grab a sweater!|`|JHchMdRraa	my hands and feet are always like blocks of ice! i think it has something to do with circulation...|`|AcvSost8aa	I am always cold too.

AA11020187	Well, you should remain positive, but there is little you can do but be there when your friend needs you. There is nothing normal about having skin cancer removed. Usually BCC and SCC are not very dangerous, but both can kill you. You friends father is not a simple case even if he has one of the less aggressive forms (BCC & SCC). The fact the tumor is more than 2cm and it is on his neck makes it more dangerous and worrisome. If it is a recurrence this adds to the concern. I don’t know what surgery he is having. Mohs would require the least amount of tissue removed, but no matter what surgery he has it will be extensive.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	There are numerous types of skin cancer.  The most common ones are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.  The first 2 types are not dangerous unless they spread below the skin, into other tissues, but it generally takes many years for them to progress to this stage, so these cancers are rarely a risk if people get them removed.  Removal of these cancers is similar to removing a wart at the early stages,  but may involve a little more cutting if the cancer is well-established. A 2x4 patch is unusually large.  <br>  <br>  Melanomas are a different story.  They can spread anywhere in the body almost as soon as they develop.  With melanomas, docs typically remove tissue around the cancer and often follow up with chemotherapy or radiation as insurance to get any cells that may have spread elsewhere.   <br>  <br>  You might ask your friend what type of skin cancer his father has.  If he doesn't have melanoma, you can reassure your friend that the cancer threat is usually over once the skin is removed.   If he has melanoma or one of the rarer skin cancers, you can only offer support and hope for the best.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	You're a nice person to be concerned about your friend.  Your friend is lucky to have you as a friend.  I had skin cancer as well.  I'm 29 and had it three years ago.  It is VERY normal for people, especially older people to have skin cancer removed.  Our skin ages, we've been in the sun, etc and our bodies will change.  There are several types of skin cancer.  Most of them are harmless and are just removed so they don't form into anything more serious.  The only one to worry about is melanoma.  That is the kind that can spread and get into the body and become cancer throughout your body.  This is the kind I had.  I noticed that a mole on my tummy looked a little odd so I went to the dermatologist.  He cut it off, put in a few stiches, and sent it off for testing.  It came back as melanome skin cancer.  I had to go back and have about the same size cut off as your friend's dad.  They do that to make sure they get it all from right to left and top to bottom to get it all.  If it is melanoma he will probably have to have a blood test and xrays to ensure it did not spread into the body.  I was blessed and it had not.  So, if it wasn't melanoma don't worry at all.  If it was and the tests come back negative, don't worry.  Do remember his neck will be hurting for a couple of weeks depending on his pain tolerance, but he'll be okay.  I hope this gave you some information and feel free to contact me if I can give you or your friend more insight.  I know he'll be fine!

UTA4G5rTaa	I know your pain!!!! I had my lower left wisdom tooth extracted on Monday also! I doubt that you have a dry socket! Dry socket is horribly painful and not easily controlled by over the counter meds! Dry socket pain typically starts at the area of the extraction, and can travel to your ear, and down your neck!  My stitch is driving me NUTS too! The stitches should dissolve in 7-10 days, so just a little longer! If you followed their post opp instructions, you should be completely fine! <br>  you can always call your dentist to be sure, I know it can be an inconvenience, but it may give you a piece of mind!<br>  Personally I have just been sitting ice cubes on that side of my face, *make sure not to suck on them* or ice water, and that seems to be helping!<br>  Dental assistant|`|1nINGDC7aa	mild irritation after the tooth extraction on fourth day is normal. it does not look like dry socket. in dy socket the pain is very acute. for more information on tooth extraction youcan visit the following link<br>  <a href="http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCategories.aspx?ArticleCategoryId=27&Name=Tooth%20Extraction" rel="nofollow">http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...</a>|`|3bvpqtAaaa	since its been 4 days after your extraction there should be very mild or no pain by now unless it was complicated to remove.you should call up and take an appointment with your dentist.if it is an dry socket the pain would be acute-but your dentist should be able to give you reliefe almost immediatly with an dressing on the socket.<br>  if you have been rinsing and spitting out the salt water several times a day,it could have displaced the clot and led to your issue.
qV8Vz36Iaa	You are a good weight. Even vegans can consume too much vegetable oil that is high in calories. You need one tablespoon of oil in your diet, no more. Also cut out refined carbs (white bread), white rice, alcohol, sugar, and artificial sweeteners. Processed foods almost always have too much sugar, fat, preservatives and other additives.<br>  <br>  Stick with a low-fat, low-refined-carb vegan diet.<br>  <br>  As for exercise, a healthy and fit adult should exercise for one hour per day 5 days per week. You should work up to this. The exercise should be aerobic where you monitor and maintain your heart rate in an aerobic zone. Look up aerobic exercise for details.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to get 8-9 hours of deep sleep. <br>  <br>  Your weight sounds about right to me. I'd make sure to eat enough beans, brown rice, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to maintain your health.

Malnutrition can lead to such things as back pains, head aches, skin discoloration, and other general aches and pains including loss of sight and hearing. <br>  <br>  Basically, your body is a machine and requires extensive maintenance and refueling of many different types of fuel.  Given that you are a teenager in the 21st century, I'm guessing you don't eat very well, most likely going out to fast food places regularly.  Unfortunately, there is rarely anything wholesome to be had when going out to eat.

cGNTSoc9aa	A smear test isnt painful just slightly uncomfortable, the doctor will insert a speculum, a plastic or metal device looking alot like a penis, which can be slowy opened up once inside to allow a swab through to take cells from the top, middle and bottom of the cervix.

You have to relax, and is not so bad. don't be embarrassed you are just a number to the doctor, he/she has seen it all before. Take care|`|6bryNB1raa	The programme<br>  <br>  All women between the ages of 25 and 65 are regularly invited for a smear test<br>  <br>  Under the NHS Cervical Screening Programme, all women between the ages of 25 and 65 are regularly invited for a smear test. The system is automated, so as long as you're registered with a GP you should receive a letter asking you to make an appointment.<br>  <br>  As a result of research that evaluated the optimal frequency for cervical screening, women are now invited for their first test at 25. They're then invited every three years until the age of 49, and every five years from 50 to 64. <br>  <br>  From 65, only those who've had recent abnormal tests are offered another test. <br>  <br>  What does it involve?<br>  During a smear test, some cells are taken from the cervix. These are sent to a laboratory for examination under a microscope. To be able to judge the cells properly, this is best done in the middle of your menstrual cycle, halfway between one period and the next.<br>  <br>  The doctor or nurse will insert an instrument called a speculum into the vagina to allow them to see the cervix. A spatula is then wiped or scraped over the surface of the cervix to remove some cells, which are then transferred to a glass slide. The doctor or nurse may also do an internal examination to check for any problems. <br>  <br>  The procedure can be uncomfortable but shouldn't be painful. Try to relax. Talk to the doctor or nurse if you're worried.<br>  <br>  Liquid-based cytology<br>  A new test called liquid-based cytology (LBC) is being introduced. This involves collecting the cells from the cervix using a plastic brush rather than a spatula. The cells are then put in a small vial of liquid and sent to the lab. <br>  <br>  This allows the laboratory staff to get a clearer look at the cells, reducing the rate of inadequate smears from about nine per cent to just one to two per cent, so fewer women need a repeat test.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The results <br>  You should receive the result of your smear test in writing within six weeks. The result will be either normal (negative) or abnormal. A small proportion of tests can't be completed because of a lack of visible cells on the slide. In such cases, you'll be invited for a repeat test.<br>  <br>  An abnormal test doesn't necessarily mean cancer has been found or that it's likely to develop. The laboratory has simply identified some changes in the cells that require further investigation. <br>  <br>  In many cases, these are just minor abnormalities that would disappear without treatment. However, a few will progress to cancer, which is why further investigation is warranted.<br>  <br>  Abnormal cells are scaled from borderline normal ('not quite right') through mildly abnormal, severely abnormal to invasive cancer. Depending upon the degree of abnormality, women may be asked to have a repeat smear in six or 12 months or referred for a further test of the cervix known as a colposcopy.<br>  <br>  Abnormalities<br>  A variety of terms are used to describe precancerous, or pre-invasive, abnormalities. The most widely used system is cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, or CIN, which is divided into grades 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe). These grades are related to the risk of the changes developing into cancer. <br>  <br>  Studies have shown that if women with CIN3 aren't given adequate treatment, 36 per cent will have developed an invasive tumour 20 years later. But even though women with CIN1 have 47 times the normal risk of developing cervical cancer, in 50 per cent of cases the cells revert to normal if left alone. <br>  <br>  The British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology has more information about invasive disease.|`|B048NSm6aa	The doctor opens up your ..uh, hole with a little metal thing and it's cold and then sticks a giant qtip in there.  you should have one to check for cervical cancer but it's not essential until you're sexually active.|`|OMxNblImaa	A smear test is a swab you have taken from your cervix and tested for cancerous cells you should have one done to catch anything detected in good time to treat it . hope this helps|`|bPYS077Raa	its to screen for cervical cancer...and as far as i know, its not very nice...but essesntial!|`|8ilJ0C83aa	A smear test collects cells from your cervix.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|69MJDg55aa	Hey!

cu8fUJbMaa	An Arterio-Venous Malformation, or AVM, is an abnormal collection of blood vessels. Normally, oxygenated blood is pumped by the heart through branching tubes called arteries to the brain, where it enters a fine network of tiny vessels called capillaries. It is in these capillary beds where the blood nourishes the tissues. The “used” (deoxygenated) blood then passes back to the heart through branching thin walled tubes called veins. Arterial-Venous Malformations are areas that lack the tiny capillaries. The location of the connection between the artery and the vein is called the shunt. The area of tissue is called a nidus of the AVM. An AVM can be thought of as a "Short Circuit" where the blood does not go to the tissues but is pumped through the shunt and back to the heart without ever giving nutrients to the tissues.<br>  <br>  It really doesn't sound a though you have any AVM as it is normally seen in a CT scan, which you had with normal results. I would see an ENT (Ear, Nos & Throat) specialist for specific testing.<br>  <br>  While Pulsatile tinnitus is not a common form of tinnitus, it has some well-known causes including:<br>      * Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) - abnormal group of arteries and veins that occur within the cranial cavity near the auditory nerve.<br>      * Carotid artery-cavernous sinus fistula - abnormal connection between a large artery and venous pool within the cranial cavity; usually the result of severe head trauma.<br>      * Chronic inflammation and/or infection of the middle ear. Chronic inflammation is almost always accompanied by increased blood flow to the inflamed tissue. Because this tissue is in the ear, some people are able to hear the increased blood flow.<br>      * Middle ear fluid. The middle ear is normally an air-filled space. If infection or inflammation occurs, or there is Eustachian tube dysfunction, fluid will accumulate behind the middle ear, resulting in Pulsatile tinnitus.<br>      * Vascular tumors in the middle ear - commonly referred to as glomus (globe-shaped) tumors or paragangliomas. Surgery is required for correction of this problem.<br>      * Pulsatile tinnitus will also occurs when the is a narrowing or a partial blockage of these arteries from an atheroma which is a fatty deposit in inner lining of an artery, which can obstruct blood flow and is caused by high levels of cholesterol in the body.

You will not be deprived of any food, You can eat anything you like,pizza,pasta,big macs, chocolate,ice cream etc. example:  You go to McDonald's and you usually order a big mac meal, but the secret is order exactly what you usually do but only eat 1/2 of it. This is the fastest and easiest (This method works much better if you have a partner because you half everything with them and waste nothing.)  Another trick is if you always super size then just order the smaller version. this one is slower but still works. Please let me know how much weight you loose and how long it took.  Weigh only once a week or once every two weeks and you will be surprised.  I never go to bed hungry. I always have something. Try an apple or orange .

1WnufoUmaa	Sounds like you have a basic cold. Your ears feel funny because of sinus pressure. You can take an OTC medication for your symptoms. I personally have found green tea with honey and lemon soothing to the throat. My throat will usually feel a lot better the next day. If it is really bad, get some lozenges or a throat spray.|`|bf4d6ed6e4b432f59cf0635119a73f15aa	WOW! Your throat is flying!!??  Amazing....<br>  <br>  OK- seriously, you need to drink lots of fluids and get yourself on a good OTC (over the counter) decongestant.  ask the pharmacist at the drug store, they'll know.  Do not go to the ER or doctor as there is not much they can do for you and it's (a) a waste of their time and (b) a good way to expose yourself to something REALLY nasty!<br>  <br>  Feel better soon...get some rest.|`|OIu7VPx5aa	I am listing few home remedies for sore throat -<br>  <br>  - Take a balanced diet including green leafy vegetables, fruits, whole grain wheat, cereals, etc.<br>   <br>  - Plain tea leaves boiled in water is also helpful in curing sore throat. Boil tea leaves in water, drain the mixture and drink it in small sips. You may also gargle with it.|`|hFNS77cNaa	It's called a cold.
AA11334001	Talk to your therapist about your pain.  <br>  <br>  I have felt the emotional pain you are referring too, but I was more like a victim.

2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Sorry, no remedy will work that fast, the illness will have to run its course, but you can get some relief and maybe enough to help<br>  <br>  What you need to do is drink lots of fluids especially hot drinks like tea or soup broth, take aspirin (not tylenol or ibuprofen).  Keep your neck and chest warm.  Take a hot shower to help clear the sinuses.  Gargle with mouthwash to relieve the throat.  Eat high protein meals today to strengthen the body.  Blow your nose often to clear the sinus passages.  Do not take any decongestants unless you are severely congested- they will dry you out and may affect your voice.  If you need to take them then take the absolutely minimum dosage (even cut a pill in half if you can).  Be careful in taking cough medicines, some have stimulants in them, it's better to suck on cough drops and hard candies to increase moisture in the mouth.  Don't drink milk or eat cheese - they will increase mucus.  Make yourself very warm by piling on the clothes today.  You can use heating pads on your chest and upper back - and hot moist washcloths on your face until they cool will definitely help.  Other than that there isn't much you can do except get rest - I'd climb into bed with my laptop and magazines and rest all day and night - and pray it works.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon water with honey may help soothe a sore throat and relieve a cough.<br>      * Use saline nasal drops. To help relieve nasal congestion, try saline nasal drops. You can buy these drops over-the-counter, and they're effective, safe and nonirritating, even for children. To use in babies, put several drops into one nostril, then immediately bulb suction that nostril. Repeat the process in the opposite nostril. Doing this before feeding your baby can improve your child's ability to nurse or take a bottle, and before bedtime it may improve sleep.<br>  <br>  Alternative medicine<br>  <br>  Alternative therapies probably won't cure your cold, but they may help make you more comfortable by easing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Echinacea. Whether taking preparations of the herb echinacea protects you from getting a cold or relieves cold symptoms continues to be debated. While no studies have shown that taking echinacea can prevent you from getting a cold, there is some evidence that it can modestly relieve cold symptoms or shorten the duration of a cold. E

Mxq1NQJdaa	The warning on your medication indicates that photosensitivity could occur, and has been reported during clinical trials, but does not mention the clinical study nor percentage of reports.  There really would be no way to tell for sure if you will experience photosensitivity as each person will respond differently based on age, genetics, other meds being taken, etc......and drug company wishes to prepare you in the event that this does occur for you so that you will not be surprised.  Do prepare yourself with some SPF if you go outdoors for any length of time.  And do remember, there are degrees of sensitivity to the sun.  Can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 50 minutes to acquire a sunburn while taking certain meds.
T9m0YQgFaa	mirtazapine is for moderate to severe depression.<br>  sometimes it's used for insomnia, panic, anxiety, ocd, ptsd.<br>  <br>  Side effects occurring commonly:<br>  <br>  *Mild visual hallucinations (when taken during the day or when awake) <br>  I*ncreased appetite <br>  *Vivid dreams / Nightmares as a result of regular intake <br>  *Depersonalization / Derealization (i.e. feeling unreal, in a dream-like state) <br>  *Weight gain <br>  *Increase in cholesterol, independent of weight gain <br>  *Drowsiness, especially at lower doses and during the first few weeks of treatment <br>  *Dizziness, coupled often with the effects of sickness <br>  *Headache|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Yes it does.  I needed it for that though.  It also can make you gain weight.  I took mine at nighttime.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I've been on Mirtazapine for a couple of months.  Sedation/drowsiness is listed as a common side effect on the patient information leaflet, 1 in 10 people will experience it.  Doctors often prescribe Mirtazapine to patients who have sleep problems as well as being depressed, to kind of kill 2 birds with 1 stone.  Sedation is only meant to be present with lower doses of the drug though, Im on 45mg.  Like all side effects the sedation effect may stop once your body becomes used to the drug.<br>  <br>  Increased apetite and weight gain is also a potential, common side effect of Mirtazapine.  When I first start taking it I would get hunger pangs that would come on really strong and suddenly, it was weird!  Thats passed now.  Its also caused me to retain water so my hands and feet are a bit puffy.<br>  <br>  As you probably know though, anti-depressants effect everyone differently.  With me, it's helped my depression A LOT!  I was previously just on Prozac which wasnt working for me, now my moods are much more balanced.|`|bFHHyDUfaa	I take mirtazapine... It was given to me for depression but also because i have problems sleeping, the first few nights it completely knocked me out, like a tranquilizer yes. But after the first week it did aide my sleep but not anywhere near like it initially did. It does help you sleep basically, and should be taken at night, but it won't have that tranquilizer effect all the time like it does in the first few days. <br>  Hope i've helped. xx|`|d40e4596ee31f7749a7773684fe3ab6baa	Hi I don't but i have a friend who does. He has found them helpful to get over a very stressful time in his life. It does have a sedative effect especially when you first start on it. It is usually taken at night. Abrupt withdrawal is not recommended as there can be some unpleasant side effects from stopping it suddenly.|`|SsXNL74Aaa	omg yeah esp in the mornings|`|nN2pIykfaa	i was prescribed mirtazipine for PND after first trying prozac with no success. when i took mirtazipine i couldn't wake up in the mornings which was no good when the baby was waking up and hubby going out to work, i just couldnt function. also i put on weight due to being hungry all the time . i told my doc and she changed me onto ducloxetine which (so far) seem to be working for the depression. but now i have to take sleeping pills as well...you cant win can you?
ed7c741f6414ddf835f87877c7adea9eaa	To offer a suggestion on why it happened....there are studies now that link using the same razor on your bikini area that is used on your armpits and legs can increase the incidence of staph infections in the genital area. This is because that type of bacteria is more prevalent in those areas. In the future, use a separate razor for your bikini area.<br>  <br>  As for now, you just have to wait until it forms a head and drain it. Be sure not to drain it IN the tub as you could spread the bacteria. Keep a bandage on it for a few days to allow it to drain completely and clean the open wound  diligently with a good antibacterial cleanser until it heals.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	Take white  bread and soak it in warm milk and it will draw the boil out an  old remedy but usually  works.(No kidding )<br>  Make sure the milk is just warm.|`|SlxeK1p6aa	I would get to the doctors as soon as possible as they can prescribe soothing cream etc that will make you feel better and probably heal quicker as well
VPlKbDplaa	Xango is a brand so you should really be asking if Mangosteen juice can help with boils....unless the company that markets that brand is paying you to promote their brand!!! And I have seen a few spam posts pertaining to Xango in the Alt Med section in the past. I presume here though that your question is genuine.<br>  <br>  Mangosteen might help as it is full of antioxidants. However, really for boils you need an antibiotic of sorts as boils are caused by a Staphylococcus organism. So you should take something like garlic... and oregano oil or grapefruit seed extract to help get rid of the bacterium causing the boils. You also need to think about a topical approach. You could apply neat oregano oil or grapefruit seed extract directly on the boil ...make sure you use a clean cotton bud each time and then dispose of this. You don't want to spread the bacterium. Don't share towels with others and do not squeeze them as you can spread the infection and you can never pop it that way. If the boil gets really bad and swollen then consider getting it surgically lanced by a medical practitioner. Don't attempt to do that yourself because of the risk of scarring or septicemia. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|L9Q6r42Qaa	Xango helps with everything. I used it when i've had mono, starting to feel sick, zits, my dad uses it for arthritis and my mom for migraines. its amazing stuff, drink some 2 times a day and also apply directly to your problem area do that for awhile and it should help. I love Xango its a life saver really!
ufgv7oTjaa	No, you should not refrigerate them unless the bottle specifically says to. By keeping pills in the fridge and taking them out daily to take your pills, you can actually destroy some of the nutritional integrity of the pills. Most commonly, the gelatin would be the easiest to be compromised, specifically because each time you take it out, you put the warm humid air from outside into the bottle... when that air in the bottle goes back in the fridge, the moisture would condense. Doing that daily would add more and more moisture, which could break down the gelatin and I've even heard of some people that stored softgels in the fridge where many of the later pills in the bottle started leaking by the time the bottle was almost empty.<br>  <br>  Most of the pills are kept best in a cool, dry place like the bottom of a closet or in a basement that aren't too humid. Granted, most people don't do this, but that is the ideal. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|MYU46ap5aa	Pills you store in a cool dry place like a medicine cabinet.
RgVfO50qaa	People might try to offer you some "miracle" fix, but the truth is-- there's no cure to the common cold. You can relieve its symptoms however, and aid in the healing process. Try taking DayQuil/NyQuil, drinking warm liquids like soup, broth, tea, cider, etc. The warm liquids are soothing to the throat. You might want to try having some honey as well, which helps the throat/cough. Also make sure to take it easy today, and catch up on some rest.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	A cold takes about one week to go away if you treat it.  Otherwise it takes about 7 days.|`|OIu7VPx5aa	Prepare tea by adding 1 tbsp of pepper powder in a cup of milk along with a pinch of turmeric and little sugar.

Y5IUse1vaa	There is no paracetamol in Rennies. You can drink straight away. If you have had a couple of paracetamols, it would still be fine to have a drink. You are better off going for own brand Ranitadine, they are around ￡1.60 for twelve and it only takes two to settle your stomach, ready for a night of boozing!! They are the same as Zantac.Tesco and Asda do their own in packs of twelve...I find that Rennies actually make you feel queasy!!!!!!!!!!!! Look for Indegestion remedy and check the pack for that glorious ingredient-Ranitadine, usually in 75mg strength.|`|RTCKiu03aa	nope its just an antacid
TTpf5tlMaa	Exercise.<br>  <br>  The stuff you are currently eating obviously isn't causing you any problems... yet... so to get tone, exercise more.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on your nutritional health, though.

You seem to be aware of your bad eating habits, so change them.  You don't have to cut out all sweets, just cut them back drastically.  I tell myself I can have a small desert only if I am very productive with my work-out (and I consider as soda as a desert because of the sugar content).  Start keeping a food/excercise log and I promise you'll start being more conscious of what your eating.  Think about it, you're about to put a large truffle in your mouth and you think, wait...do I really want this on my food journal..?  Good Luck!|`|j9BVAhoqaa	You definitely need to cut out the intake on the sugar.  I am now 33 years old.  I was never past a size 4 until I reached 30.  I also had two children before the age of 30 and I was still able to fit into my jeans after.  Like you, I barely ever ate healthy.  I could always eat what I wanted and still be thin.  I just want to tell you it catches up with you eventually as it has with me.  I am now struggling to keep weight off.  I have been eating sweets for so long it is very hard to stop.  You would be very smart to try to change your eating habits now.  Try bringing carrot and celery sticks to work with you so you snack on those instead of the candy.  The one thing I think that saves me from gaining even more is I was never a big soda drinker--lots and lots of sugar!!  Cut out the soda.  Once in a while is okay but break it down to maybe once a week if you can.  <br>  You should really try talking to a nutritionist.  Do you go to college?  Sometimes you can get some free help in certain areas.  I hope you are successful in what you are trying to accomplish and good for you for thinking about the future.  Good luck!!!|`|xq2J2LMSaa	So, let's see:<br>  - you eat a quarter of a pound of candy a day<br>  - you eat 4 meals a day<br>  - you drink caffeine-free/sugar-full coke<br>  <br>  You're right, some of this is not just bad, but dangerous eating habits.<br>  Really, I think your first move should be to find a new job. You don't have to cut out -all- sweets, but working in a place like that makes it really, really difficult to resist temptation!<br>  Eating four meals a day, if they're composed of healthy foods, is actually not a bad thing. The more often you eat, the more even your blood sugar will remain.<br>  As it stands right now, with your mostly-sugar diet, your blood sugar will go from really high to really low very quickly. You probably feel pretty rotten a lot of the time.<br>  If you absolutely refuse to quit your job, eating healthy is going to be a test of will-power.<br>  - Bring lots of healthy, filling foods and drinks to work. Carrots, broccoli, sandwiches (preferably made with whole wheat or multigrain bread) with lots of vegetables, meat and cheese, mixed nuts, fruit, that sort of thing.<br>  - Try to drink water or milk instead of pop, juice is all right (a bit too much sugar), diet pop is okay (non-sugar, non-caffeine) but should be your last choice.<br>  - Instead of eating candy, you have to make the conscious choice to eat something healthy that you've brought instead.Bring things you like to eat, which will make avoiding temptation easier.<br>  - Feel free to munch all day! If you eat lots of little meals, many people prefer this to three big meals.<br>  <br>  If you really want to get -toned-, weights are a great option. ANd, they're often easily found at home. Look for canned foods or pop bottles filled with water or sand. If you use light weights and lots of repetitions, you'll get toned without going "beefy", and without too much sweating. Try to find activities you like; if you find something you like doing it's easier to stick with. The longer you stick with exercising, the faster and longer-lasting the results will be.
5rJ6nf2oaa	Yes this is common in people who have a less than ideal diet. As the years go by the liver just becomes clogged and sluggish. I doubt it's the wine unless you drink to excess, but it can contribute to fatty liver. The good news is these changes at this stage are reversible, the liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate. However it needs some help from you.<br>  <br>  You need to do a liver cleanse immediately. Not the harsh product-derived program but a gentle diet-based detox. There is a famous liver doctor called Sandra Cabot (The Liver Cleansing Diet) who worked this diet up and it works fantastically. I would recommend it for you. It takes 8 weeks for the cleanse to complete. <br>  <br>  Basically you need to eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy and anything processed and full of additives. Replace this with fresh seafood (not fried), some lean chicken (no skin), lots of fresh vegetables, salad and fruit (raw is more cleansing), and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. Drink lots of water to flush through the toxins, and try to make a fresh raw vegetable juice every morning. <br>  <br>  I've done this diet myself and it's the real deal. There is a little more to it but you won't starve. Read the articles below that explain the diet further and offer an example diet plan. Best wishes.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Fatty liver disease can sometimes be caused by damage to the liver from drinking excess alcohol, but it also happens when a person's body doesn't process fats efficiently. This form is called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.   Its possible that you have the nonalcoholic form of the problem and if so, the solution is usually modifying the fats in your diet, and avoiding or minimizing use of medications that are had on the liver such as Tylenol, ibuprofen, or Alleve. Otherwise, drinking moderate amounts of alcohol is generally not a risk.|`|NZoHMFryaa	Absolutely. You can get fatty liver from many things you might put your liver through, obesity, pollution, etc., but this is mostly resultant from alcohol use.<br>  <br>  Best wishes for your good health!

tYO2Ir1oaa	They'll probably just give u iron tablets. I'm prone to being anaemic, too, because i'm vegetarian, but iron tablets make me ill, and it's always better if possible to do it through diet. Try and eat red meat a couple of times a week if you're a meat-eater. Also, all green vegetables have good levels of iron, and try to eat iron-fortified cereals for breakfast (they are fairly common). Also important is that u have a lot of vitamin C, because this is what allows your body to absorb the iron into your blood. i'm 23 by the way, and was diagnosed with anaemia when i was 21, but no longer have it because of improved diet|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	I was diagnosed with anemia last year. My Dr did further test to see what the problem was. It can be as simple as having very heavy periods. In my case it was female problems causing the me to lose blood and I had to have mine corrected with surgery but that is a worst case scenario. With your age it will probably be very simple. My Dr gave me iron supplements that you can buy over the counter. It takes a while to build your red blood cells back up so you can expect to take the supplements for several months before you start noticing a difference.|`|AA10674555	Anemia is quite common.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the iron pills they often recommend do not work so well. In the more progressive hospitals where I have worked we do some really high tech stuff to build blood iron stores. <br>  <br>  The more important test is the TIBC or total iron binding capacity.<br>  <br>  Here is the interesting thing. If you boost your glutathione you will solve the anemia problem. If you boost your iron you will boost your glutathione. <br>  <br>  The high tec iron boosting technique is using a nutracutical called black strap molasses. Mix it with peanut butter and with a spoon full of each and it becomes a medicine. Do this three times a day and you will have more than enough iron and energy.<br>  <br>  Also work on your diet to boost your glutathione.<br>  <br>  The doctors who see this work the first few times do not believe it. Then they see a patient who has a blood count of 2.9 (the lowest of any of my patients) start to come up and on seeing it a few times they are sold.<br>  <br>  This is used to avoid  giving life threatening blood transfusions. Actually, some doctors say the transfusion you avoid may save your life. So if it works for them, it should work for you too.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|KL1GW0wpaa	It is very common for girls in their teens and 20's to have some sort of iron deficiency, especially so during period, etc.  I am pretty sure that when you have your initial blood test, the doctor requests the lab to look for a small list of things - not just iron levels) which might point to reasons why your iron levels are low.  I wouldn't worry too much for now, but do ask your doctor on Monday to put your mind at rest.|`|uYz8ipcJaa	It may depend on how deficient you are in Iron....<br>  I got diagnosed with iron deficiency last year.  I'm just 16.  They told me to eat more red meat and gave me iron supplement pills, and that was pretty much it for me.  It didn't sound like there was anything life-threatning about it or it was a sign of something more serious.<br>  Hope you're well otherwise.|`|a5ExZKCiaa	If you are diagnosed with Iron deficiency they might give you a generic like Feosol.

AA11388527	You may be a student but you know that the RBCs in her urine indicate hematuria.  May be due to trauma or infection. (Bactrim)  Now why would your being a nursing student not help?  I'm going to throw some terms & details at you that you may have to learn.<br>  <br>  Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin) is prescribed primarily for UTIs so that's the presumptive diganosis in your daughter's case.  Now the UA is only half the story.  The C & S is the other and just what did the culture show to be the causative organism?  UTIs are usually bacterial and most often E. coli-related and nitrofurantoin is effective for E. coli, Stpah a., enterococci & some Klebsiella and Enterobactor.<br>  <br>  The mono fever usually ranges from 102 to 104.  You state her fever was slight which I interpret to mean low-grade.  The throat, patches of infection, cervical lymph nodes and tender spleen also sound right for mono.  FYI:  Splenomegaly occurs in only about half the cases of mono.  An average spleen is about 12x7x4 cm but the actual size varies with the age and size of the person.  You were told only one of the measurements, the length.  The other two measurements are width and depth.  <br>  <br>  The initial symptoms are fatigue, a crummy feeling, anorexia and chills.  It's clear there infection going on and like me, her doctor suspects a virus.  You could request that the Monospot be repeated.<br>  <br>  Did you ask why she's being tested for a metabolite imbalance?  That's associated with metabolic disorders of which there are many.  What other labs were ordered besides this?  Does it include virology and/or blood cutlures?  Perhaps she has both a UTI & a viral infection.  Something else to consider and possibly bring up is that Klebsiella is one of our gut flora.  When it gets outside the GI tract, it can cause some nasty infections -- UTIs, chills, fever, flu-like symptoms and more.  Can't help but wonder if this turned up in the urine culture.<br>  <br>  I'm aware you already have your hands full with your daughter's illness but is there anything I can do to help you with your nursing program?

But, as a parent, I can only tell you that I would not be satisfied with what is going on. I would want answers and I would want them now. You know your child better than anyone.

bmhnXEsVaa	This will sound odd but it works...Lemon juice and olive oil does work to remove kidney stones. Sometimes the stones pass out in about 24 hours itself after this remedy. You need to take 2 oz each of lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil and mix well. Drink this followed by a glass of warm water. This is an excellent and a very effective remedy to get rid of small kidney stones. If you find it difficult to drink this then try this: take the juice of 5 lemons and mix it with 2 small cups of warm water. Add 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and sugar or a natural sweetener to it. Run it through a blender to mix well. Drink this in small quantities throughout the day, at least 3 to 4 times.

IwXuWX05aa	There are several causes.  These black marks are actually splinter hemorrhages, blood lines, under the nails though some say they can be particles of fat carried by the blood and they get stuck.  They may also be minute clots of blood.  Yes, they could be a sign of a heart infection (sub-acute or acute bacterial endocarditis), but they may simply indicate trauma to the nail (are you, for example, hitting your hand against a headboard while you sleep , thus injuring the nails  or doing manual labor).  In some cases, it can indicate arthritis while in others  it is a pigment problem, a localized area of increased melanocytes (pigment cells). These are just a few of the causes. The most important thing is to talk to your physician as soon as you can.  By talking to your doctor asap, you'll stop worrying about it.

I wasnt happy with how I looked and I spiraled into a full blown eating disorder. That was 8 years ago. I m about to enter a treatment program for the first time. there are days where I wish I didnt have bulimia. becasue you loose your entire perspective of yourself and eating disorders are very habit forming. and with the way you think your fat you may be starting to go down this path I advise you to look at the mirror and tell yourself I look good today even if you dont feel like you look good. Its extremely important to keep your self image positive.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	You are perfectly normal!<br>  If people tell you its bc you're tall, its bc you're tall!<br>  <br>  I hate that so many young girls are so self conscience about their weight.

qitXGd0qaa	I didn't experience this problem with mine. If I were you, I'd wait it out a few days, about the length of a regular period. If you're still having heavy bleeding next week, I'd call the OB's office.<br>  <br>  For me I had a few regular periods, then some spotting, now I haven't had a real flo of a period in about 3 months, just some occasional spotting. I've had my IUD for almost a year. JMHO, you've got to give your body some time to adjust to having an IUD and I think the long term rewards will outweigh the negatives in the beginning.
KOYC3XkJaa	A little bit of bleeding is normal, but not a lot. How long has it been bleeding for? Have you tried anything to stop the bleeding? <br>  Pressure is the best way to stop bleeding, but you want to be careful about about applying pressure to a piercing so you don't cause damage. You can also try icing your ear. Cold constricts the blood vessels; constriction slows down the flow of blood. That may be enough to stop the bleeding.<br>  If all else fails, phone up your piercer or a doctor.
NdKuSlVsaa	Bulimia is very hard to beat. I have been bulimic for 7 years, and it's only been over the past few months that I've gotten help.<br>  <br>  The first step is to tell your doctor. They can reccommend support gropus that you can go to. These groups can give you strategies, and share experiences. People in the groups have all been where you are, and as tough as it is, you do need to beat this.<br>  <br>  Although your test show healthy now, that will not always be the case. Myself, I damaged a part of my esophagus, and now have to take pills so that I don't get constantly burnt by stomach acid coming up. <br>  <br>  You need to take a deep breath, and know that you are stronger than the bulimia. Try eating small healthy meals, like fruits and lean proteins. Those are not high in the calories that make you fat, and you can slowly work your way up into regular eating, without purging. Also start taking a multi vitamin, it will help your body rebuild the nutrients that you are losing when you throw up.<br>  <br>  My email is mara.chu@gmail.com, please feel free to email me if you just want to talk or anything. I know that support is one of the best things to help you beat it, and I want you to know, from a recovering bulimic to a bulimic, I am here.|`|xDQadV2Zaa	I don't think your mom can force you to eat unhealthy.  But yea, just stop hurling|`|JHchMdRraa	i have the same problem but my parents don't know. if they found out i would hate them forever. i'm not close to anyone in my family. i get embarrassed if they say i love you or hug me...anyway, you should tell your mom that she really isn't helping you. monitoring you? that isn't going to change anything. unless she's actually had an eating disorder, she doesn't know the steps it takes to get better, a professional does. i have no idea what a "stigma" is. (i'm only in 8th grade!!!) so yeah. is she trying to make you over weight again or something (no offense but 211 wasn't a very healthy weight for your height) once you get better, you two could go on a diet together or something. you can't do this by yourself because eating disorders are extremely hard to break. and ask your mom why she gets mad at you for eating healthy food.|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	Please get professional help.  You have to tell your Mom that you need to go to the Doctor.  Your life is more important, than some "stigma".  You need help that we can not give here.<br>  <br>  If you keep doing it, it is worse than eating.  You will send your body into starvation mode and it will hold on to fat.  You need to eat healthy to maintain.|`|6e0PG4YWaa	The mental aspect of the eating disorder has already had an affect on you.  I suggest that you seek professional help, because you do not realize how dangerous eating disorders are.  Not only do they pretty much take over and control your life, but they have serious damaging effects on your body, your mental health, and your physical health.  I don' think your mom being on your case is the issue, she is only concerned about you, I think the problem is that you in fact have an eating disorder and it is taking a toll on you and your body.  Here is a link to an informational site about eating disorders, and on the site there is a helpline number which I recommend you calling.  Good luck!  Hope I was helpful...
ZbMLigR3aa	Definitely let your mom take your to the ER hon.  It sounds like you are experiencing a severe allergic reaction.  You will need to be treated with IV meds if that is the case.  As a person who suffers with these types of reactions all the time, I can tell you that you will feel better once the er docs give you the proper medication.  I wish you luck and hope you feel better soon.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Mom's know best....let her take you to the ER..maybe an allergic reaction. And you may need medication|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Hives themselves are not life threatening unless they affect your breathing. You definitely need to be seen again by your doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Look up pictrues of urticaria.<br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0geu9.b6J5JDVIA11hXNyoA?ei=UTF-8&p=urticaria&fr2=tab-web&fr=slv8-msgr">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a>|`|4L8HpWPjaa	Yeah, get to the ER!!!!!!!! Maybe it isn't dangerous, but don't take the chance... something is going on; I would go to the ER today.|`|K6fasl6kaa	your mom has a very good idea.  an extreme allergic reaction can become life threatening.  it could be other things as well including sepsis.  don't wait any longer.|`|HD29O7Ataa	I would go to the hospital if I were you. The drugs being administered to you seem to be having their desired effect for a few days, then are having a placebo effect after a few days of drug therapy (meaning the drugs don't do anything after a few days). <br>  <br>  Sounds like something really serious, and you may possibly be admitted, meaning they might keep you there for treatment. It's the best thing for you.<br>  <br>  Hives/redness/swelling could be a sign of an allergic reaction. Like you said before, you currently have an autoimmune disease. This may be connected, maybe not, go see a doctor! <br>  <br>  I'm no doctor, and with that said I can't make a diagnosis, but like I said, I'd go to the hospital if I were you.|`|85O36QGIaa	Try taking Benedryl and if that doesn't help after a half hour, perhaps you should to to the ER.  You may have had an allergic reaction to a drug.  I got an allergic reaction to an antibiotic the day I finished taking them. The reaction continues because the drug is still in your system.  It could take time. Better safe than sorry.

kEOmy8jraa	OOOOHhhhhhh...congratulations on your special day!!!  <br>  <br>  The cramping may not get worse until you get a bit older. <br>  You should tell your mom and ask her about using tampons or pads. <br>  You may not feel comfortable using tampons just yet. But, once you do-they offer more freedom and you don't feel like you have a mattress between your legs. In fact, you don't feel like there is anything there. <br>  <br>  But, first talk to your mother-She may not want you using tampons at first. <br>  <br>  If you do feel crampy, use a heating pad for comfort or motrin as directed. However, motrin is a blood thinner - so you may notice a little bit more flow. Drink lots of fluids. <br>  <br>  Welcome to womanhood! Go easy on yourself-at times, you will feel tearful and cranky and not understand why....it's because your hormones are all out of whack. It will be alright!  best to you..|`|BRDqfAy3aa	please read below about First Period|`|VV2BZvlLaa	that's your period for sure!<br>  <br>  the brown is dried blood and the blood is blood lol<br>  <br>  is this your first period?<br>  <br>  best of luck xoxo|`|zbMCU2o9aa	same thing happend to me...al i did to be safe was put a pad on and the next day or the day after that it started bleeding.<br>  <br>  welcome to the club!LOL|`|VkbZfOBAaa	Omg, go tell your mom right away you just got your period. your sooo luckey i didnt get mine yet ! :@ haha i want it soooo badly you cant even imagine

BJuHbQXfaa	Yes it can cause the your eye to turn black and also bruised as well. I had a friend who had a big one on his eye and the doctor had to remove it, plus put him on an ey drop to help heal it.  If it gets really bad you will need to see the doctor.|`|AA10045887	If you play with it you could bruise it but you should leave it alone and apply warm compresses to your eye several time a day and if it doesn't clear up see a eye doctor.
U8GwHmDiaa	What they detect is the THC metabolites that accumulate in your fat cells, the residue is pure THC so it would raise your levels. I smoke pot too and when I used to get tested I wouldn't smoke for about 4 days before my test, eat healthy, and especially get lots of cranberry juice and niacin in my system. Eat plenty of vitamins too. That's all there is too it.|`|PVe6jK78aa	No.....you get high off the THC in marijuana and residue has THC in it its just as detectable.|`|AA11283315	All the resin in the bowl is is burnt marijuana with bits and pieces in the bowl that have been sucked up threw the pipe and then stuck to the inside. So when you smoke that your also are burning pieces of pot so it will raise your thc levels....|`|xC0l866eaa	It will get you high if you smoke enough of it. It produces more of a body high then a "stoned" high. It does raise your THC levels, but like you stated in your question; not as much.
AA11967904	I had a space in between my teeth and it bothered me greatly. I don't think you need braces but instead putting I believe enamel between your teeth to close the gap. You will feel better about you self when it's done. I can under stand why you'd want it done any one would feel self conscious about that. I was surprised how much better I felt when I  had enamel put in between my teeth to close a gap.|`|tVOzjukaaa	I barely even see a gap between your teeth. I don't think it's worth it.<br>  <br>  When I was about your age the orthodontist tried to sell me on the idea of braces because my incisors protrude just a bit. I decided against it because there was actually no dental health reason to do it. My teeth were, and still are, straight and healthy like yours. Consult your dentist, but just looking at your picture I don't think it is worth it.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Keep in mind that it will keep shifting on its own as you get older- so it's probably self correcting|`|AA10112346	Yeah, it doesnt look right..|`|AA12113138	no. but if that thing is a mole next to your eye you might want to remove it

If it's green or yellow, then you have a serious problem. If it's white, then you have a serious problem. If it's brown or black, you have a serious problem.

AA11599407	You mouth hurts because the purpose of the appliances is to move your teeth into a different location. Usually the first 24 to 48 hours is the worst. They will change the rubber bands when the do your adjustment at your next appointment.|`|c91032f4386f0b1ceea8747a91b30331aa	It's completely normal for your teeth to hurt and feel a little weird for the first few days to a week. You won't be able to feel them in your mouth in about two weeks. Try eating soft foods for the next couple of days. They should change your colors every time you get your braces tightened, which should be about once a month. <br>  <br>  (and if you don't like the blue then don't worry) I got light blue last time and they turned lime green in like a few days! :D|`|O0VQqIkDaa	Yes, it's normal.  Take some Advil and you'll feel better.<br>  They change colors at every visit.|`|illEyGMoaa	don't worry you'll get used to it. Every time you get your braces tightened they hurt the next couple days or so, but other than that, you don't even know they're there.
OGvcuSCcaa	you are not getting enough protein. my guess is that before you filled up on pastas, chips, and other starchy, non healthy foods. to fill that gap, you need more protein, which makes you feel full. lean proteins and best, chicken, and turkey. soy is good too. or lean beefs, 95<br>  % grounds, or steaks without a lot of fat on them, new york strips, ribeyes, and eye of rounds are all good.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	I did and you are right. Make sure you're getting some sort of protein with most of your meals. It will help alot.|`|lECmz3SEaa	running and 3 healthy meals with 15% less fat per meal.

When you eat more it gets worse. <br>  <br>  I'm wondering if you drink a lot of fizzy drinks (coke, pepsi etc) that can cause this aswell. <br>  <br>  You have nothing to worry about at all apart from it getting worse if you dont cut back on fizzy drinks, and you need to eat more healthier, fruit etc will help.<br>  <br>  You may even have Abdominal Migraine which is not very common but it's what you described. It's not heard of much and you'll probably only hear about it this time in your whole lifetime.<br>  <br>  Just ask your doctors about Abdominal Migraine, they shall prescribe you something for that and see if it helps. But i'm 80% sure its trapped wind. Your young so your diet would be pretty bad :)<br>  <br>  Hope i helped mate.|`|AA12286468	It could be several things, such as over-exhaustion of your liver or a stomach ulcer, but based on your age these seem unlikely.<br>  <br>  I agree this could be a case of Texidor's Twinge, where the nerves and muscles can have a "malfunction" and cause incredibly painful sharp pains in a specific place on your left side under the rib cage.<br>  <br>  There isn't a cure as it's non-lethal, but perhaps muscle relaxants such as Diazepam or even Cocodamol may help when the pain arrives|`|7Os9oipBaa	When I had Mono my spleen was enlarged and sore, etc...also leading to me not eating very much. The thing with Mono is that it can come and go over long periods of time. If you've been tired or have had a sore throat then I would suggest going to a doctor while you're experiencing symptoms. Otherwise it wont show up on a blood test.<br>                  It could also just be a nervous thing. You'd be surprised with how stress/anxiety affects your body.
CHiEKZrLaa	I'm sorry you're in this situation; it's definitely awkward.  It sounds like you're not altogether sure what the old doc's reasoning is for "divorcing" your mom, and it's perfectly okay to explain that to your new doc.<br>  <br>  Be honest and forthcoming, without pointing fingers.  Your new doc should be professional enough to assess your mom's health (and the situation regarding her pain meds) independently.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fvuEtkROaa	If Mom was following instructions, she would not have been dismissed from the practice.  I know you love your Mom, but you can't be an enabler by not recognizing  she has a problem.  Your new doctor should approach your Mom without prejudice, but will only retain her as long as she follows the treatment plan.  Good luck.|`|bRkhq7Rhaa	patients are consumers and doctors are there to provide care to them.  doesn't matter if she left her ex-doc or he dismissed her.  what's important is that you find her a dependable and trustful doc right away.  when you explain, say that you were not satisfied with what the old doc was doing and the doc was not providing enough of a proper care.  this can also give the new doc a heads up about what you expect from him/her.  you are the patient and you pay the doc.  when professionals get paid to do professional work, they better act like professionals.

fLU63N4kaa	I don't know if there is a term, as I never did any research into it myself, but I did feel very much the same way for a very very long time up until just recently and the mood swings were really common.

If it is something serious then you need to have on a bracelet.  you can put your medical information in your wallet, if the paramedics don't find it there then the hospital surly will. Include your history as well as a list of all the medications you are currently taking.  Keep them close to you ID because they will always look for that. (including paramedics, police on a scene and the hospital staff) Also, might i suggest ICE.  ICE-in case of emergency.  In your phones phone book put ICE before the names of your emergency contacts.

HlD9dRF2aa	First for all the "quick weight loss posts" :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/acai-berry.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/aca...</a>  (By the way that's the 11th post today for Acai or Tea that I've seen today.)<br>  <br>  Now for the real way. Work out smarter, not harder. Low intensity workouts (elliptical, running, biking) where your heart rate stays in Zone 2 (60-70% of maximum heart rate) burns calories at a rate 85% calories, 15% glycogen.  The higher your heart rate or the more intense the workout the lower the ratio of Fat to Glycogen becomes.<br>  <br>  If you run 3 miles in 23 minutes and your heart is pounding at the end, you've burned about 480 calories of which probably 400 cal. came from sugar.<br>  <br>  If you WALK 3 miles in 45 minutes, and you feel like you could walk another 3 miles no problem, then chances are you burned 400 cal. that came from fat stores (which is harder for your body to replace) and 80 cal came from sugar.  (The number of calories burned is essentially the same in either case because you do the same amount of work -- the laws of physics are hard to change.)<br>  <br>  LOW intensity exercise for the duration is the way to go for weight loss.|`|dUj7rP2haa	You want to do both cardio and strengthening exercises to loose weight.  The cardio (running, biking, dancing, skipping, swimming etc) will help you burn extra calories.  The strengthening will build muscle which will burn more calories over the long run and help you maintain your new weight when you reach it.  So cardio helps with short term weight loss (as well as being important for you health) and strengthening helps with long term weight loss.|`|d4f71f4718c1422e0a4437d8240d74e6aa	One word - Water, warm water with honey, take it in the morning before anything and then in the evening before your snacks. <br>  The thing is honey is natural sweet so it wont fatten you, and combined with water will help clear your bowels faster thus there wont be much formation of reserve fat in your body.<br>  <br>  Tried by my granny and at the age of 65 she has more stamina than me, not to forget bigger biceps ( my biceps are 14.5 inches ).<br>  <br>  Along with this, the usual walk is just great. <br>  <br>  Just dont stop eating, eating helps you lose instead of gaining but then be wary of the unhealthy or so called "diet" products. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck.|`|EwR91zQuaa	I THINK AEROBICS WOULD BE GOOD FOR LOOSING WEIGHT ALSO MAYBE PILATES|`|NPMKqJlMaa	Cardio, running on a treadmil for 1 hour|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Run Run RuN!!|`|XQvLV5imaa	Exercise that's fun!! <br>  <br>  Go Snowboarding!

3QIWdvG1aa	Usually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).<br>  <br>  These drugs, which treat both influenza A and B, work by deactivating an enzyme the virus needs to grow and spread. If taken soon after you notice symptoms, they may shorten your illness by a day or so. Oseltamivir is an oral medication, but zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and lung disease.<br>  <br>  Both medications can cause side effects, including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and trouble breathing. They can also lead to the development of antiviral-resistant viruses.<br>  <br>  In November 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the maker of Tamiflu to include a warning that people with the flu, particularly children, may be at increased risk of self-injury and confusion after taking Tamiflu. The FDA recommends that individuals with the flu who take Tamiflu be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any antiviral medication.<br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.<br>      * Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>      * Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>      * Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  These steps can help you stay healthy, even at the height of flu season:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Get an annual flu vaccination. The best time to be vaccinated is October or November. This allows your body time to develop antibodies to the flu virus before peak flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is usually December through March. However, getting a flu shot later in the flu season may still protect you. It takes up to two weeks to build immunity following a flu shot.<br>  <br>        Keep in mind that the flu vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, especially for older adults, but it can reduce the risk and severity of illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 70 and 90 percent effective in warding off illness in healthy people under age 65. It is less effective in older adults. Health experts recommend vaccinations for people over 50 because the flu shot may reduce the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths.<br>  <br>        Healthy people ages 2 to 49 alternatively may receive the flu vaccine via a nasal spray called FluMist. It protects against the same strains of influenza that the flu shot does. Like the flu shot, FluMist is given every year. Because FluMist contains live, but weakened, flu viruses, it shouldn't be given to pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and those with chronic illnesses. A study published in 2006 found that FluMist was only between 30 and 57 percent effective in preventing the flu in adults. However, another study in 2006 found that giving nasal spray vaccine to school-age children helped to reduce the spread of flu in the community. And in 2007, researchers compared the effectiveness of FluMist with the flu shot in children ages 6 months to 5 years. The children treated with FluMist experienced about half as many cases of flu as did those treated with the shot. However, FluMist increases the risk of wheezing in this age group — especially in those who already have asthma or recurrent wheezing and in all children under age 2. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore approved FluMist for children older than 2 years who don't have asthma or recurrent wheezing. Consult with your doctor about which form of vaccination may be best for you or your child.<br>  <br>        You can get the flu vaccine from your doctor, at public health centers and many pharmacies. In some areas, flu vaccines are also available at senior or community centers and at supermarkets.<br>      * Wash your|`|13k2WKx8aa	Whatever you would normally eat provided it's not something like McDonalds or Popeye's.<br>  <br>  Aim towards green leafy veggies would be another thing.

cCZyXV6caa	Well... let's look at the situation, shall we? Statistically, most people (the vast majority) who attempt suicide via wrist slashing actually survive. Anyone who really wants to put an end to themselves probably would not attempt it in this fashion, especially around other people as this will almost certainly result in failure. Ergo, one must come to the conclusion that this person did not intend to actually go through with his threats and was merely seeking attention.<br>  <br>  However, without knowing more about what's going on in this person's life, and their personality type, once can't guess simply by this behavior alone. He might be crying for help because of something else going on that he feels he can't handle...<br>  <br>  The classic attention seeking mental disorders are histrionic personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. One of these MIGHT be present depending on this person's normal mannerisms. Look them up on wikipedia, and tell us if they describe this person.

He said it was serious because of the acid getting into the esophagus & the lining of the lungs.  He gave me a prescription for Pepcid because it's cheaper than the OTC brand.

Eat meals slowly, swallowing too much air seems to be a contributing factor to causing more stomach noise.|`|P8xN2IzIaa	sometimes this happens when i eat too.  I think it is just the sound the food makes when you digest, but I could be wrong maybe get checked out at the doc?|`|T6PzMyPBaa	you might be eating food too fast and your stomach is going crazy trying to digest it<br>  it happens just eat a little slower.<br>  but honestly it's perfectly normal

If you have an insulin imbalance, it can cause imbalances in other chemical reactions that cause imbalances in other hormones.<br>  My high insulin resulted in high testosterone and low progesterone, which caused DUB problems.<br>  <br>  If the high insulin causes a chronic low blood sugar condition to occur (hypoglycemia), that may result in depression.  www.hufa.org has some basic info about low blood sugar, and a symptoms list at the symptoms link, that may be useful.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you get out of the depression, quickly.|`|2c1701be7bac6d1b9ddb83918955e927aa	It could have something to do with the thyroid gland.

It does help my anxiety a little bit; when i stopped taking it --i quit a little too fast; (i had about 4 --5mg. tablets & I tapered off as slowly as i could --with those 4  pills!  i  did fairly ok---but think i was even MORE nervous than I was WHILE takiing it;   i  hope to get off it again  some day; but have to THINK on this and possibly find other med. or med's to help me;    I don't think  Zyprexa  helps my depression much. I guess i need to be on a med. for depression, - along with Zyprexa;  I am bi-polar;  altho - my mania did not return--AS BADLY - when i quit that  year! - and  I still needed 12 hrs. on average of sleep;  ( but the anxiety was TERRIBLE - while off the  Zyprexa - so i  went back on it.;  been back on it bout 3 yrs.!  <br>  i crave sweets--sometimes chocolate;  but mostly  ice cream or cereal.

If you love someone, their size shouldn't matter anyway. Unless their size is risky for their health. Some girls might not date you because you are  overweight, some girls might think you're too short (I personally think pretty tall guys are attractive. 6 ft at least because my dad is 6'2 probably).<br>  I'd certainly be worried that you are that overweight.

muHctmaGaa	I went on birth control pills to regulate my menstrual cycle and aggravated a pre-existing but unknown heart condition. Which isn't necessarily to blame the pills themselves. I don't know how many problems come from the medicine or just their interaction with the user's overall, sometimes imperfect health. It's easy to get on bc as a teenager without checking for sterility, then discover you can't have a child and try to blame the extra hormones. It doesn't quite work that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Are you aware birth control pills actually lower the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers? Breast cancer links are inconclusive at best.
AA10592685	Having loose bowel movements after every meal is a reason to speak with a Doctor,   You could also increase the fiber in your diet  (whole grains  and fruits and vegetables)  with at least 6 -8 glasses of water a day and see if that helps!  Peace!|`|0948bd5a88aa2c09d8903792496cd05aaa	It might not be IBS and I don't think it's a fast metabolism. A fast metabolism would deal more with your weight and your ability to gain/loose/control it.  Actually a lot of people who do natural foods and organic foods can have up to 3 bowel movements in a day and it basically means your bowel is healthy.  The diarrhea isn't. Try adding a bit of cheese to your diet, it can help act as binding agent to stop the diarrhea.  If it doesn't stop with in a few days go to the doctor and talk about the diarrhea not IBS or fast metabolism. Good luck.

You might want to ask your doctor to do a blood test to check your Cortisol level. It's done at 9 am as this is the time that our body releases it most.  Stress effects your metabolic rate too. You might also want to check your tongue and if there is any discolouration or swelling, point that out to your doctor if it is there. And finally, is your digestive system working ok? I thought mine was fine until I collapsed in agony and they discovered a bowel blockage that had been there for at least a year.

And if you lose weight then you would be less likely to be depressed. Also take control of your life and when you stray away from what is good for you don't get down on yourself just keep trying to aways do better. Sooner or later you will be doing more of the good things then the bad and with that you will see the fruits of your labor.  Also be and stay positive And never give up or give in Remember nothing good ever came easy. And when thing things are not going so well remember nobody got anywhere or anything done by panicking.

Try to find solutions to your job related stress.  If it's a person or different things, address the matter and make changes.  Set up a diet and exercise plan that you can adhere to that will alleviate your situation not add to it.

nv5Mewe3aa	It really doesn't matter when it comes to swimming because it is one of the best activities with regards to engaging your whole body. The only thing I'd say is to perform all of your strokes and change the intensity from time to time.  I like doing sprints every 6 lengths or so.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	A mix then - alternate lengths doing front crawl and breast stroke - and do about a mile a time.

Hip rotation in this technique is where your power comes from.You might do a video search on total immersion swimming (look for Shinji Takeguchi's video)  A good way to start toning abs is to reach forward as far as possible on each stroke.  <br>  <br>  The other book is called Workouts in a Binder (2 versions -- one for Triathletes and one for Swim Coaches and Triathletes) -- There are at least 50 different workouts. <br>  <br>  To start out I would suggest intervals. They tone faster than long steady workouts and train you to swim at different speeds/paces.  This is primarily for freestyle.<br>  Sample:<br>  Intensity is on a scale of 1-10, 1=very easy minimal effort, 10=there's a shark behind you.<br>  warmup 6x75M intensity (3 of 10) (:20 rest)<br>  2x200M Intensity (5 of 10) (:20 rest)<br>  1x100M Intensity (7 of 10) (:20 rest)<br>  2x300M Intensity (5 of 10) (:30 rest)<br>  1x100M Intensity (8 of 10) (:20 rest)<br>  2x200M Intensity (5 of 10) (:20 rest)<br>  1x100M Intensity (7 of 10) (:20 rest)<br>  Cooldown 6x75 any stroke intensity (2-3 of 10)<br>  <br>  This evening I plan to add a 2x400M Intensity (6 of 10) at the end of the mainset and do the first 2x200M without kicking.<br>  <br>  Happy Laps!
YbEQ8Wv5aa	I'm assuming you're in school. Over half of kids in school do that.

It doesn't just affect your schoolwork, it affects your day to day memory. You'll leave the house forgetting to put on deodorant, forgetting to put on socks under your shoes or forget your bookbag with all of your school books at home.<br>  <br>  If you're really that concerned, get tested.

They have medication that helps curve the symptoms without completely changing you. I have that as well and was put on meds when I was in junior high. The first meds they put me on had me feeling tired all the time and I just didn't feel like myself.. They switched me and it worked like a charm! I was able to focus and do well on my school work and it didn't change the way it made me feel in any other way.

Don't risk it.)<br>  <br>  So, my suggestion is to not speed your diet up, but to stimulate your metabolism. You can achieve that by:<br>  <br>  1) As everyone said, drinking lots of water<br>  <br>  2) Changing from time to time your daily calorie intake: For instance, if your diet is based on a 1500 kcal daily intake, it's better to arrange to take 1,700 kcal one day and 1300 the following, rather than a fixed 7 day per week 1,500 kcal intake.

If you are good in math you will find that keeping these stats in mind, 260 pounds in a year. Losing 260 pounds is the figure, which is unbelievable and unexpected.<br>  <br>  This kind of claims are planned just to cause clients to make impulsive decisions. When you gain weight, did you gained around 50 minds in two months? Certainly not. We gain weight in weight in small parts, which add up to our weight. This keeps on increasing with time.<br>  <br>  I think you get what I mean to say. We normally gain weight in grams like 65 gram per week. With this stat you are going to gain around 7 pounds at the end of year.<br>  <br>  This weight is so slow that you cannot measure it weekly. But in fur years you are going to gain around 28 pounds.<br>  <br>  So how can you expect this weight to go in few days? You are going to lose the way you have gained it. So it will take time to lose weight. So you have to start losing weight systematically. You can lose weight by developing the good eating habits in you and nutritious foods.

AA10151307	Your periods become regular. They come at a predictable time every month..and do happen every month. Your breasts are not sore every single day. They may be sore during "that time of month" though. The appearance of pubic hair on the entire pubic area that is not just a small amount. The growth of underarm hair that is a significant amount. For me puberty last from about 9 (my breats started to develop) and lasted until about 15. I know it is a long time but thats when my periods evened out.  Hope this helps. Height and weight have nothing to do with it. You can be done wih puberty at 15 and keep growing until you are 18. It has to do with hormones. You can also tell alot by age. There are not alot of girls that are done with puberty that are under 14 or 15.

RXBb8kx7aa	Not a story of me personaly, but of a guy I worked closely with for a while. When I met this guy he was a little under 300 pounds. By the time I met him, he had already resolved to eat better and lose wieght. We were out exercising alot and walking around every day, so that helped a little bit, but his diet was a huge factor. He began to eat lots of carbohydrates (macaroni and such) for breakfast. Carbohydrates get the body going full of energy, but if not used, have the potential to make a person more fat. If they're used then they get the metabolism going like crazy. This guy exercised to make sure he got those carbs moving. He would then eat a very light lunch, just enough to hold him over until dinner where he would only have one mediocre helping of everything and never have seconds. After about 3 months, he was down to 198 pounds. Yeah, he lost about 2 pounds a day but still remained healthy and kept his wieght under control after that. Not a typical story to lose so much so fast, but it was pretty fascinating to be watching him improve daily.|`|VtDnvmg4aa	Hey!  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master cleanse" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  The strange thing is.. I tried having low fat diet, eating low carbs, starve at times, follow diet programs and so on but it just didn't help!<br>  <br>  Then one day, an old friend of mine who used to be obese saw me.  She teased at me at first and I felt embarassed about it and she told me her secret on how she lost her weight.  She gave me a book entitled "Strip That Fat" - within a month I lost 18.3 lbs!<br>  <br>  I seriously recommend and urge you to learn more about this since it has helped me a lot - it demystifies false beliefs like low fat diet, eating low carbs and such help you!  <br>  <br>  Learn the real truth:<br>  www.Strip-That-Fat.tk|`|OGvcuSCcaa	geese, i hate those automated responses. suck dont they!  i have been losing wieght for about a month now. I have been on this diet twice. <br>  <br>  First time around on atkins, i weighed 230. started working out, and doing the diet, and got down to 180. big difference, especially in high school. I hovered around 190 for about a year and a half, then got into a car accident and lost my job. unfortunately, i was reliant on someone who only ate fast food. <br>  <br>  So 3 years later, here i am - was at 275, and now am at 253. I am doing great, and my motivation to reach 150 have never been stronger- because tha'ts the weight in which the doctors said they will give me clomid- to make me ovulate and have kids.  so i am going strong, and hope to reach 150 by x-mass!<br>  <br>  I also have another motivation: i get a new tattoo when i reach goal weight. i have always wanted on that covers my shoulder, and my arm, and never wanted to get it because i was afraid it would stretch.<br>  <br>  I also keep a pair of 13's right above my scale, that way i can be reminded of it everyday! i started off in 24's. and now at 20's.  <br>  <br>  I truly am so proud of myself. most morning i do a little happy dance when i see that i have lost a half of pound, or whatever it be. I am happy that i am finally taking charge. Tho i have no reached my weight goal, i know that i can do it, and i am thankful that i have made it this far. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck in your journey, and hope you reach your goals, and learn how to be healthy!

Stop eating two hours before you go to bed. I would run in the morning before breakfast. remember it's ONLY twenty minutes, and the Curves workouts were also only twenty minutes.

AA10780929	It's not weird at all. Lots of women have sex dreams and orgasms while they sleep. This is very common in guys — it's called a "wet dream." But girls have wet dreams, too! There is less evidence of wet dreams in women than in men because less liquid is produced or spilled on the bed sheets.<br>  <br>  When women have sexy dreams and become excited, it's common for their heart rate and blood pressure to hike up, their nipples to get hard, and their breasts to enlarge. Blood flow increases to the genitals so that the clitoris swells and the vagina lubricates itself, producing wetness. This can happen when women are awake — and while they're asleep!<br>  <br>  Wet dreams are healthy and natural for both girls and guys — they're nothing to be embarrassed about.

When u get a certain stamina, you have to keep on exercising it to maintain it and even to increase it.|`|191ee5febd3f729f792cecd54180bae5aa	Loss of stamina occurs when you cannot do what you did the day before or have been doing before.|`|8b6792676712cc5043e48e67107cbeb7aa	not enough sleep...|`|AA10592685	It's a lack of energy for doing the things that you normally have the strength and energy (or get up and go) to do!
AA10592685	The oragel wore off and the pain returned, if the pain gets worse you will probably need medical attention sooner (it could be infected) then you would need antibiotics may be even before they will touch the tooth depending on how infected it is!  Good Luck!<br>  Don't put it off til the weekend you may end up in the ER!|`|3ced4c0f5e7f724ad99bcdefdcb462b7aa	Sounds like you have a possible abscess that is spreading<br>  Orajel is just a numbing medication that does absolutely NOTHING to treat the cause of your problem<br>  You have to see your dentist ASAP <br>  You could wind up in the ER if you don't<br>  You don't want to risk your life over a tooth.|`|8227e18f42bc3c52446ffefcf3e8c9dbaa	Sounds like you have an abscess.  If you notice that your jaw becomes swollen then this is most likely what it is.  <br>  The orajel really has nothing to do with it.  If you reapply the orajel it may not do much b/c it sounds like you need a root canal.  <br>  Take 2 - 3 ibuprophen (which is an anti-inflamitory) and call a dentist.  I know you don't want to hear that, but if you do not get this taken care of it will create more problems for you.  Find a dentist in your area who works with Care Credit.  The dentist will pay the intrest and you can make monthly payments.|`|AA11040180	i had a wisdom tooth that had a hairline crack - when i used orajel it made my whole jaw hurt.  i guess it has sugar in it and that was able to get to the root of the tooth through the crack.  at least that is what my dentist told me.|`|AA11149006	maybe the pain is really coming from your jawbone and radiating out.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Try gargling warm salt water instead of orajel, and put a warm compress on your cheek. It should help ease the pain, along with Ibuprofen to reduce the swelling/pain.

cb2NxPERaa	No, you wouldn't lose a lot of weight. Piercing your tongue doesn't really make it harder to eat. But, you would be at risk of infection.|`|QxIhMHwAaa	It has been proven that people who have their tongues pierced have a higher risk/chance of losing their sense of taste in the future because of the nerve damage that is done to the tongue. There's also a huge chance you'll crack your teeth on the piercing and possibly swallow parts of it now and again, not to mention the increased risk of infection. Don't do it. It's a health hazard.|`|RREJ58Ayaa	At first it might be difficult to eat - at least that was how it was when I got snakebites (two piercings on my lip). It hurt too much to eat so for a while I was taking small meals with simpler food like apple sauce. I actually did lose a tiny bit of weight at first but after I got used to the piercing I could go back to eating like I used to and didn't lose any more weight. So no, you won't start dropping pounds like crazy when you get your tongue pierced. It really just depends on what you decide to eat.|`|PyNtY2Ataa	No you wont loose weight.<br>  <br>  most people i have come across with tongue piercings are freaks in one way or the other|`|mwVIgUL4aa	no|`|sDwN4XuIaa	Seriously, piercing your tongue is not a way to loose weight.  It is not hard to eat and yeah fro the first few days you have to be careful buy you get used to it.  I did mine when I was 18 and I was over weight, it didnt help me loose weight at all.  I didnt gain a ton but I didnt loose weight.  <br>  <br>  Weight loss should be done with prper diet and exercise.    That is the best way to do it, ther eis no get skinny quick, that is unless you want to develop an eating disorder, and being someone with one, I highly dont recomend it..  Take your time and do it the right way : )|`|c3IXjK26aa	No. A tongue piercing is nowhere near a weight loss cure. The initial swelling only lasts a week maximum, unless you're extremely sensitive. And even during that week, regular eating is only really painful for the first 1-3 days. And even though it's a bit tender, you still can eat like ice cream and softer foods (which are usually more calorie-packed anyway). <br>  <br>  So if you have issues with weight, a better solution is to figure out why you eat the way you do. Because if you want to eat, you will, regardless of how your tongue feels.<br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself, am I overweight because I eat too much or because I eat unhealthily? And do I exercise enough? <br>  <br>  The reason I say this is because depending on how you eat, you can figure out WHY you eat that way: emotional issues, lack of willpower, sugar addiction. And when you figure out the reason behind your eating style, you can work on improving THAT aspect of your personality and that will positively affect your eating behaviour. <br>  <br>  Bad eating habits are a symtom of a larger issue. If you seriously want to lose weight, don't forget that. This is coming from the advice of a person who is 5'3" and used to weigh (at my largest) 206lbs. I now weight 135 (occasionally 140).|`|kzbbMx3maa	No way. You might not be able to eat for a few days like me but no weight loss at all. If it was that easy i think everyone would get it done.
fR2Geezcaa	It sounds like you are still recovering from the food poisoning. I have had food poisoning twice in my life really bad, one time it even infected my kidneys and I ended up in the hospital. It took me about two weeks to recover each time. Just keep eating easy to digest foods and your doing the right thing with the fluids, just make sure they are not full of sugar.|`|QvxUDjdGaa	might have an infection|`|tjTbkxkzaa	I would think your stomach is a bit irritated from last week and still needs some time to recover.  Continue soft foods and fluids that are easier for your stomach to digest.  Try some Pepcid over the counter to reduce your acid production for a few days.  If ot better in a nother week go see your doctor again|`|GaLw1qMwaa	you obviously dont smoke pot or you wouldnt be nauseous.<br>  <br>  try valerian root. walgreens has it. it will help.<br>  <br>  you neeed to stay away from dairy until you feel better. cheese is dairy.
BG8vMyZjaa	All faeces contains bacteria that can cause stomach upsets if ingested. However, the greatest risk to public health from dog faeces is toxocariasis.<br>  <br>  Toxocariasis is an infection of the round worm Toxocara canis5. It is a zoonotic6 disease that is spread via unwashed vegetables and dog faeces. Young children in particular are at risk due to their weaker immune systems and because they are more likely to expose themselves by ingesting the eggs. A puppy can pass as many as 15,000 eggs per gram of faeces, and they are a major source of environmental contamination.<br>  <br>  If you want to read more the link is below.  Where I live owners have to clear up after their dog, that doesn't involve actually touching dog faeces with bare hands though.|`|w29tsXLUaa	Dog faeces can cause blindness. They sometimes have little worms in them and if a child for example touches them and then puts her hand in her mouth it can cause blindness.<br>  <br>  Of course faeces carry germs so always wash your hands if you have to pick them up to throw away. Even using paper or polythene bags of course.<br>  <br>  Clean floors or anywhere they have done it with disinfectant.|`|nOT6vxIwaa	yus yu can, but its ok as long as you don't eat it raw
sDwN4XuIaa	TRy calling a depression help line, that sounds like what you need to do.  Surgery is yeah a way to get attention, but not a possitive way to do it.  When you are depressed the best thing to do is find osmeone to tlak to, someone outside of your normal circle of people.  Usually when people feel like this, someone they know had surgery recently or soemthing like tha tand they saw what kind of attention they got.  Try talkign to someone it may help.  Surgery is very drastic and is not worth it, it is very painful and expensive as well..  especially if you dont need it...  My advice is to seek someone you can tlka to and do it soon|`|Lqf3BAImaa	No...stop it...you should join an online self help group, the people there will help you lift your spirits!|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	what? I don't get it...|`|6f26517551df99b004cf1422979410f8aa	there is no way you can get emergency surgery without a severe injury. you should seek some sort of counseling wanting that kind of attention is not normal
p3NsXo0baa	I can feel my glands in my armpits,my groin, my breasts, the back of my neck and under my jaw.<br>  Ive had lots of scans and blood work and looks like mine has no cause. Possibly stress and because im so skinny.<br>  You need to stop searching for things wrong with your body. Also poking at them will make them larger. Do you have any bad teeth? I have 1 and think that might cause my swollen glands in my neck.|`|JFZVhej6aa	It could just b a swolen lymph node. Id just leave it for a few days. But if its still there after a week Id go for a medical oppinion from a doctor.|`|0YJgQ4W8aa	At  your age, it's probably a pimple or an infected cyst. If it's not red or painful, best to just leave it alone and see if it doesn't go away. There are some lymph nodes in the area, usually in the soft part of the skin below the jaw. If you push on it, it will swell up and sometimes become tender.|`|zzkmdusEaa	There are a lot of things it could be besides cancer. It could be your lymph nodes swelling up because they are trying to fight off an infection (I would get this checked out, unattended swollen lymph nodes will kill you faster than cancer if not taken care of.) It could be other swollen glands in that area, the most likely condition is Mono. It also could be nothing to worry about such as a protruding vessel or just a scist.<br>  <br>  I would ask a teacher at school such as a nurse or an anatomy teacher and get their opinion if you need medical attention or not.
niZBsn9Qaa	The body is an absolutely amazing machine, yes i said machine. If you keep adding memory to a computer, it will have more capability right? Well, with more muscle comes more strength. There are several ways to get over a plateau. Plateaus are temporary if you keep working at it.<br>  <br>  What I would recommend is one of the following:<br>  <br>  1) lower the weights by one unit and do more reps for a week then switch back to the heavier weight.<br>  <br>  2) keep your current weight, but do more reps. On your last set, push yourself to do as much as you can, until you feel like you're going to pass out. Just on the last one. For example, if you normally do 6 sets of 15, on that 6th set, do 20, or 25, or as much as you can. Stop at 19 if that's all you can do, but push yourself hard on that last set.<br>  <br>  a week of this and you'll find that you are doing reps on that last set. That is an indication of increased stamina and strength. THEN you can try to up the weight a bit and see what happens :)<br>  <br>  good luck

AA11339295	Why not just ask him if he is circumcised or not? I don't believe he'll be offended unless you say it looks like a triangle.|`|AA11622777	Hmmm...a triangle eh? Are you sure he's not an alien from another planet? Seriously penises do vary in shape as well as in size. You might do a Google or Yahoo Image search on "penis pictures" or "c--k pictures" and see if any of them look familiar. There is at least one site that has pics of all imaginable shapes and sizes but I don't know the URL off hand. I suspect he is pretty normal and has lots of company in the way his penis looks and if it does what is supposed to and he's happy with it (and he should be!) I wouldn't worry about it. As far as the circumsized part...if the head of his penis is uncovered when he is NOT erect, he's been circumsized. If it's covered with skin, he's uncircumsized. Of course when he gets a hard on it will become uncovered.|`|AA12386736	It may be due to the way he masturbates.<br>  <br>  Sometimes if a guy has masturbated in an irregular way for several years it can cause a malformed penis or even penis curvature.<br>  <br>  The Power Jelq device can help restore correct penis shape.|`|AA11483076	If your bf has loose skin that can cover the head of his penis,then he's not circumcised. I have to agree with another responder though... would he appreciate you discussing this for others to read???|`|AA11753462	I UNDERSTAND THAT U WANT ANSWERS, BUT THAT'S JUST GRIMY TO TALK ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIENDS FAULTS LIKE THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW, EXPOSING HIM LIKE THAT.

nhLvrVx9aa	You just have to think about things to take your mind off it.<br>  I know sometimes it can be pretty hard. (yeah I know LOL!!)<br>  Specially at night time.<br>  <br>  But...whats really wrong with what your doing?<br>  So you masturbate, who cares. Who says your friends don't do the same thing and you never know about it?<br>  <br>  Masturbating 1-2 times a day is not bad at all. I used to do it 5+ a day when I was your age.<br>  I used to make sure my friends were sleeping and then masturbate.<br>  Try sleeping in the same bed and try not to shake the bed LOL! Yeah I've done it. I'm just glad I was small at 14, I my up and down motions were small haha!<br>  <br>  I went to a YMCA camp for like 2 weeks in the summer...try it there, because you know you can't check 12 other kids to see if there all sleeping. But when you hear other kids do it in their bunks, it puts your mind at ease a little.<br>  <br>  We just have to deal with it bud. But do it in your own way as not to bother anyone. From the sounds of it, your doing a pretty good job.|`|tjTbkxkzaa	Why would you want to.  It's perfectly normal to please yourself in this way.  You're doing it in private, not bothering anyone else and it's nobody's business but yours.  I have done the same thing in my earlier years and still do on occasion.  Your normal.  Don't worry about it, don't feel guilty, just enjoy your sexuality.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	dude, you're 14, you're supposed to jerk off everyday. don't waste your time trying to stop, instead, have a little self control.|`|AA12375639	Very normal at your age.....and people masturbate at every age, whether they have a sexual partner or not.....masturbating is a good way to relieve stress and get to know your body.

dFHsAXDMaa	Okay first all not sure how old you are? but let me tell you that you can save yourself money the sexy lingerie cost a cute bra and panties work and it is usually off in seconds lol<br>  <br>  I am a nurse wife mother...... And I have to tell youwhat you should be worrying about the first time you have sex is making sure you protect yourself from diseases like stds, hiv, aids and pregnancy. you did not say whether it was his first time too. I can tell you the names off so many girls who got pregnant the first time they had sex that I have met over the years.  I can also tell you ot is going to suck, it will be way less amazing as you are imagining it to be and you will be disappointed. first He will kiss you, touch you and then he will pentrate his penis into your vagina and you will feel a little resistance he will have to push past that which for most girls is painful. if he waits a minute or to for you to adjust after before continuing he will give you time to relax. If it is his first time as well you can expect it to last about 2 minutes which is not enough time for the majority of women to climax or have an orgasm so do not be disappointed it the sky does not fall. <br>  <br>  not sure how long you have been dating either but think about this is he your forever guy the one you are going to marry one day..... if not think about the consequences of seeing him in the hall at school are you break up because he now got what he want from you and is moving on to next girl. Imagine what it will be like seeing him kissing another girl in the hall a few weeks later. <br>  <br>  I am not telling you this to be negative... but because I coach cheering at local high school I am a nurse and a mother and over the years I have seen so many girls crushed because they gave up their virginity too soon, boy breaks up with them and they now feel used hurt dirty etc. <br>  <br>  remember condoms can break, the pill is never 100% effective and does no protect from diseases.... as my sister she was marrried and on pill and got pregnant with twin boys lol.<br>  <br>  just think about your decision....your virginity is something you can only give away once.......it is the most precious gift you can give someone is he truly worthy of that or would your future husband be more worthy. I know it seems like everyone else is doing it but most never have and are lying about it|`|VJ2lMc0Laa	Make sure he's wearing a condom!!|`|SaOLhaPYaa	any of this<br>  <a href="http://www.3wishes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.3wishes.com/</a>|`|AA12166900	He should be wearing a condom!

I shed 30 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|vR20yJ7Paa	Women tend to gain weight when their hormone levels are high, and this occurs when they are either 1) teenagers or 2) pregnant. Girls often start gaining more weight during adolescence. The way to stop this and lose weight instead of gaining it is to avoid sugar and white flour. Stay away from white bread, white pasta, sugary cereals, soda, sugary anything. Also, stay away from processed food (the kind that comes in a package ready to eat). Instead, eat whole wheat bread, nuts, lots of veggies and fruit. Basically stick to natural foods.<br>  Also, eat only when you are hungry!! All the things I am advising you are things I do myself, and I am 27 and only weigh like 100 pounds. You can do it!
dFHsAXDMaa	Okay as a mother of four kids 2 girls 17 and 15 and 2 boys 14 and 11 I would definitely say teenage boys can be awkward and clumsy <br>  <br>  but as a nurse the fact that he was bleeding for a few hours tells me he has some type of blood disorder like anemia... at his age clotting should happen quickly. I would definitely say he should be looked at by hiss pediatrician. If you know who it is I would bring him while he has a few days off if his mother is too busy or too unconcerned. <br>  You could be saving his life. because blood disorders that go undiagnosed can lead to a multitude of other issues.|`|HHQEkv3Yaa	yeah its normal.<br>  they get clumsy sometimes.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	He may have a neurological disorder or a blood disorder.  The blood should have clotted when he cut himself or stubbed his toe pretty quickly.  He could have something that they didn't catch at the optometrist so a second opinion couldn't hurt.  That or he could be really clumsy.  Some people unfortunately are.  You are not his mother so there's not much you can do to help him.  Encourage your friend to get her son checked out.  Doctor's will run several tests and give her a better picture of his overall health and well being.  If he doesn't have anything wrong, I would suggest that he pay more attention!|`|tjTbkxkzaa	He's probably just distracted by thinking of other things and not paying attention to his immediate environment.  He's young and probably has a very active mind.  I wouldn't think it's anything to worry about.

I'll tell you why<br>  <br>  1) almost all of our body's fat cells are formed before the age of 18. A common misconception is that when people lose weight, they lose fat cells. You NEVER lose fat cells. They just grow or shrink. But, the more fat cells you have, the higher probability you will be an obese adult with problems to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  2) Adult onset diabetes. Kids can get diabetes just as easy as adults can and its scary. At this age its better to nip it in the bud NOW. He really needs to go on a diet.

23F70N1Raa	Yes, anything that can be put in or on the body a person can be alergic to.  Although this is an uncommon alergy, I had a friend who had negative side effects from being around the smoke itself (not smoking it).  It is entirely possible that he is alergic to the THC or the other chemicals in the drug.  The worst part about this situation is that not only is he alergic, but it is illegal.  If something happens to him, he will need to fess up to not only doing something illegal, but getting sick from it.  The best bet is to stay away from all drugs not perscribed by a doctor.  While the medicinal uses of Marijuana have been proven and are useable in some states in our country... these still require a doctors perscription and the drugs are clean.  Tell your friend to avoid this drug and also tell him not to pick up ciggs. either as some of the same carcinogins are also found in them and could cause a reaction.  I don't need to tell you that drugs are bad... but this is one of the reasons why so many people are against these drugs.  The point is... that with out government regulation you can be getting anything... it is dangerous and not worth the risk.  I have known many people who fell victim to drug abuse... some of them did not make it... they all started out with pot.  Take this as a learning lesson that just maybe it is illegal for a good reason!|`|7Os9oipBaa	Of course its possible for him to be allergic to it. People can be allergic to anything and everything. <br>  <br>                  Why does he keep trying if this happens to him? Also, my friend smoked pot a few times and also passed out. I think that sometimes its just a little bit too much for the brain to handle for some people. If he was allergic I would think that his throat would close up or something more along those lines.<br>  <br>  Good luck, stop smoking pot.<br>  Yay.|`|2M1Q3i3iaa	if either of you are that worried about his health, then he just needs to stop smoking it.<br>  then wambam! <br>  <br>  problem solved.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	so tell him to stop smoking it|`|DfKdzD46aa	it is possible to be allergic to anything, but its also possible that is how his body responds to the drug. It would probably be best for him not to smoke it.
13k2WKx8aa	Congratulations. You're allergic.<br>  <br>  Edit: The more you smoke it, the worse your symptoms could become. I'd advise stopping before you trigger a severe asthma attack or some fun filled variants of shock.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	I don't know, weed?  never did have that happen to me.

The first time you felt this you should've quit smoking immediately. You are probably allergic, and like kenny said next time you do it it could be deadly.|`|FnDz57xRaa	yeah, your body is obviously having some adverse reaction to smoking weed.sorry bro, but i guess you'll have to quit toking|`|EMbaak9waa	Its your body's way of rejecting it.<br>  Its not agreeing with you.<br>  I would stop smoking it if i was you.|`|73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	The first guy got it right- you're allergic.

One is that this could be some kind of a tumor<br>  of the connective tissue underneath the skin which normally constitutes the earlobe. The most probable possibility is clogged sebaceous gland of the earlobe. It is not uncommon to have clogged sebaceous glands in the earlobe. They are a result of poor hygiene or some kind of an infection. Most people don’t even notice them, or notice them as small lumps in the earlobe, but some of them tend to get infected and they can grow to be very big and can become a great problem for the patient. They can hurt but they don’t have to, the pain usually appears when the lump starts pressing on some nerve ending in the earlobe. Trying to squeeze them out will only cause you more pain and can worsen the infection. The safest solution is to go to a plastic surgeon and have the lump removed. It may be the smartest thing to do because they could rule out the chances of some kind of a cancer<br>  , don’t worry the procedure isn’t painful and it shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes to do it. Good luck with it."

AA11020187	There are 3 parts to stage III 3A 3B and 3C. Stage IIIB has a 5-year survival rate of about 56-60%. As the stage gets higher the survival rate gets lower. Which stage 3 a colon cancer falls is determined by a combination of the depth of invasion and the number of lymph nodes involved. This tells us statically how likely the disease will progress. Colon cancer is a stage IV when cancer has spread to a distant site. It is most often the liver, but it does not have to be.

Even if it's cold outside, bundle up and take a walk every day.  <br>  When I get depressed, I make myself do this and I'm not sure why it helps, but it does.<br>  <br>  Did you have plans for after you finished school? Perhaps you could take a class or two at a community college.  It usually doesn't cost very much to take one or two classes, depending upon what they are.<br>  This would give your days some structure, and put you back into the 'school' environment that you feel comfortable in. Plus, maybe you'd gain some interesting knowledge! or learn a new skill! The sky's the limit there!<br>  <br>  A job, even a part time one, would busy your days and give you income.  It never hurts to have some money! Money buys freedom and allows you to go out and do more things!<br>  <br>  Or volunteer an hour (or more) a few times a week at your local food bank. If you think this is an odd suggestion, I am only suggesting it because a friend of mine had to do this for community service once, and she talked me into volunteering at the same time. It gave us both a wonderful feeling to help out there, and we both still do this at least a few hours a month, it gives you a great feeling to help out.<br>  <br>  Well, hope some of this helps!<br>  <br>  Peace|`|YlLdIPRvaa	It sounds like you need to get yourself invested in something.  Go back to school, get a job you love, start a business, join a club or pick up a hobby.

Next time, keep this in mind when the seeds of doubt start creeping into your head.

Feed your mind and soul only positive thoughts, surround yourself with positive, good people.  Sort of like "fake it 'til you make it" and eventually it will become reality.<br>  <br>  You're still young and maybe your self-expectations have been high.  Are you in school, community college, working?  I hope you are because sitting idly, waiting for life to come, will definitely drive anyone insane.  Get out, do something and stay positive.

It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

Great to hear you are trying to do some exercise. The crunches are a great start. You also need to get moving and do some cardio movement that gets your heartrate up. I would suggest walking on sunny days. You can push your baby boy in the stroller. If you are stuck inside you can run up and down the stairs, two at a time going up. Cardio is huge for belly fat.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. If you need more tips, email me.|`|5TLGa3awaa	I'd recommend buying fitness DVD's.  They tell you what to do, how to do it and show you how to push yourself without hurting yourself.  I was tired of spending over an hour working out after I got home from work so I bought Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred DVD.  It's has three 20 minute workouts that are HARD and will get you in shape pretty quickly.  You just need a mat and hand weights.  20 minutes a day isn't much, you could do it while the baby is taking his nap!  I had never tried a fitness DVD before this and I have to say it's pretty awesome.  Don't get me wrong, it's not easy and you will be sore the next day but no pain, no gain.  Go to Amazon and browse the fitness DVD's.  They have helpful consumer reviews.  You just have to find the one that is right for you.  <br>  <br>  PS - To get rid of the "pooch" you need to do reverse crunches.  Lie on your back, hands behind ears (don't let your head rest in your hands) and raise your knees off the floor.  Raise your butt off the floor, hold it for a second, then come back down.  Repeat 3 sets of 15 reps.|`|dUj7rP2haa	I'd suggest you go to your local library and check out a bunch of fitness videos.  That will give you a chance to see what you like before you buy any.  Other option, is if you get FitTV.  Once you know know you like you can invest wisely in a few that will help you.

Everytime someone has a weight loss question, these bozos are ready with their quicklinks and marketing.  The jig is up, guys.)<br>  <br>  Now for the real way. Work out smarter, not harder. Low intensity workouts (elliptical, running, biking) where your heart rate stays in Zone 2 (60-70% of maximum heart rate) burns calories at a rate 85% calories from fat and 15% glycogen.  The higher your heart rate or the more intense the workout the lower the ratio of Fat to Glycogen becomes.<br>  <br>  If you run 3 miles in 23 minutes and your heart is pounding at the end, you've burned about 480 calories of which probably 400 cal. came from sugar.<br>  <br>  If you WALK 3 miles in 45 minutes, and you feel like you could walk another 3 miles no problem, then chances are you burned 400 cal. that came from fat stores (which is harder for your body to replace) and 80 cal came from sugar.  (The number of calories burned is essentially the same in either case because you do the same amount of work -- the laws of physics are hard to change.)<br>  <br>  LOW intensity exercise for the duration is the way to go for weight loss.

Actually headaches are more common in woman.<br>  <br>  Headaches vary from a mild pain in forehead, top of head, back of head to a full blown out migraine, which unfortunately I have suffered with since my early teens.

If it is an increase in your metabolism it could be from you steppin gup your work out level and food level, or one or the other.  IF anxiety you could be having nightmares and not know about it.  How much bedding do you sleep under?  You could be getting hot in the middle of the night.  Also some people tend to sweat more than others at times.  Have you been sick lately?  A fever breaking could cause severe sweats, if you are female and at mid age, you could be starting throught he change and having hot flashes, this could cause it as well.  It truthfully could be any number of things, it might be best ot actualyl go to a doctor, they may need to check things like levels in your blood, hormones, vitamin levels, Iorn levels, and other htings it could be caused by an imballance of sorts as well...|`|ed7c741f6414ddf835f87877c7adea9eaa	Night sweats is a symptom of HIV, not to freak you out or anything.|`|AA10429440	how old are you? are you a man or a woman? do you have any other symptoms?

You are immune for life unless there is something that causes your immune system to fail, such as aggressive chemotherapy, AIDS, etc.<br>  <br>  Most people incorrectly believe they have gotten mono again because they did not completely recover from the infection and the symptoms returned. It can take quite some time for the infection to resolve.|`|fvuEtkROaa	I disagree with the first answer.  Like most viral infections, it is believed that you only get mono once.  However, there is always the person who breaks the rules and gets it more than once.  The mono test can remain positive for months even tho the infection has resolved.<br>  <br>  .|`|hVICguqGaa	i think you can keep getting it all through your life and are more susceptible to it once you have it|`|13k2WKx8aa	As the first poster said, it is possible to get it more than once.

texbmCj0aa	Hey , i'm the same, although i don't really cry about missing people. But about really trivial stuff and i'm easily hurt. I feel your pain. <br>  And i hate that everyone is being mean because you don't know what it's like unless you are in this situation.<br>  I'm sorry but the only advice i can give you , is just try to,...hold it back!<br>  There is really no other way. It's very psycological. Just for example if a teacher is yelling at you. TRY to be mad at them . You will not find yourself in tears. It comes with time and practice. i'm 14 and i still have trouble sometimes but im getting better. Try to not think about it when you are in these situations. Find a good hobby , make yourself busy by socializing ALOT at school. You don't want to seem vulnerable, people will hold it against you. I have been mildly bullied. And no , i'm not a geek freak with no friends. I am actually a "popular girl". I don;t say this to be vain. Just to show that it doesn't matter THAT much to people. As long as you keep it under control (again it takes time) . I sicerely hope i helped ;]<br>  <br>  PS ; Girls like guys who cry ;D|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Don't be hard on yourself everybody cries and anyone that tells you they do not are liars .You're missing your Dad that perfectly normal and if you get upset when you get bad marks that is good cause you will push yourself to do better .

Trust me you will not go wrong in life with that attitude you may think your Prayers will not get answered but they will just keep the faith . Be happy lol . cheerio .|`|FnDz57xRaa	go running or jogging|`|BcrYBSJmaa	just remind yourself that your dad will be back soon and focus on other things in your life<br>  think of all your positive traits, and be confident, and that will make all the small bad things that go wrong seem more insignificant.<br>  <br>  The key is to really think about whether the things that you cry about are worth your tears?<br>  <br>  If you do badly in school, you can always get better, it's not the end of the world, if you get yelled at, maybe it's not your fault, and even if it is, so what! you learn from your mistakes!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lzKt3RtOaa	The older you get and the more bad stuff that happens to you makes you stronger.

After a good cry, you sometimes feel much better. Society says that men who cry are weak, but I think it just shows sensitivity which is MUCH better than arrogance. You can be masculine and still cry, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Don't worry, you're fine.|`|hdrIaMF3aa	make an appointment and talk to your school counselor they will be able to help you, I had this problem when I was younger and it really helped me|`|kDab6zpTaa	geeze.i dont think there is really a way to stop crying.|`|fdFGiCeNaa	TOUGHEN up bro.

You just have to accept that dude. It'll be ok =]|`|d1a7edebc33c3995ba43b888a1d936abaa	well, first thing is ok to cry, everybody cries your not the only one. of course his hard to see your dad home when you guys are close to each other. But when you miss you dad so much and you feel like you want to cry just give him a call. <br>  <br>  Now getting bad grade can be sad, because you want to be an "A" student which you can al you have to do is change the way you study. Baby Boy you don't have to cry about this, those thing can be change.<br>  <br>  Listen do not cry when someone is yelling at you but I know some times it can hurt your feels.<br>  <br>  To become strong who have to believe in yourself. Always say "I CAN DO". Remember you have to help yourself first and some one can give you an advice but it is up to you to take it or leave it. Is your live, and life is too short to be crying all the time just be happy anf thankful if what you have now.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you|`|cqluTdrDaa	I think you've got a lack of confidence. It's better to think about yourself like: Hey, I'm a good person.<br>  People often cry when they are unsure about things. It's hard to give you a good advice but first: get some confidence by doing things that make you happy and make you sure of yourself! If you've got a nice hobby, then do that, try to develop yourself and be happy with who you are.<br>  Good luck :)|`|v36A07Nnaa	i used to be like that when i was your age. i used to cry all the time. for everything. but as i got older i realized that it's sometimes not worth crying over. you know. if you get a bad grade don't cry use that sadness to try harder next time and get a good grade. (:|`|87TTGyQsaa	its alright to cry, but you must also tell yourself not to just sit and cry all day. you must do something about it. crying gets you nowhere.|`|doD7Z7Dfaa	Weirdo....|`|7izZ17ncaa	you will see it. just keep praying and be tough on yourself. And some people are just emotional so don't worry man.

AA11229176	15 is not too young at all for Endo to be a concern.  For free, current and accurate info on the disease, offered with no hidden agenda other than to support and educate patients, visit the Endometriosis Research Center @ www.endocenter.org. Their literature states:<br>  <br>  "About Endometriosis:<br>  <br>  With Endometriosis, tissue like that which lines the uterus (the endometrium) is found outside the womb in other areas of the body. Normally, the endometrium is shed each month through menses; however, with Endometriosis, these implants have no way of leaving the body. The implants still break down and bleed, but result is far different than in women and girls without the disease: internal bleeding, degeneration of blood and tissue shed from the growths, inflammation of the surrounding areas, and formation of scar tissue result. In addition, depending on the location of the growths, interference with the normal function of the bowel, bladder, intestines and other areas of the pelvic cavity can occur. Endometriosis has also been found lodged in the skin - and even the brain.<br>  <br>  Symptoms include chronic or intermittent pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation is not normal!), infertility, miscarriage(s), ectopic (tubal) pregnancy, dyspareunia (pain associated with intercourse), nausea / vomiting / abdominal cramping, diarrhea / constipation (particularly with menses), painful bowel movements, painful or burning urination, urinary frequency, retention, or urgency; fatigue, chronic pain, allergies and immune system-related illnesses are also commonly reported complaints of women who have Endo. It is quite possible to have some, all, or none of these symptoms. Endo symptoms are varied and often nonspecific, so they can easily masquerade as several other conditions, including adenomyosis ("Endometriosis Interna"), appendicitis, ovarian cysts, bowel obstructions, colon cancer, diverticulitis, ectopic pregnancy, fibroid tumors, gonorrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, ovarian cancer, and PID.<br>  <br>  Despite today's age of medical advances, researchers remain unsure as what causes of Endometriosis. There is NO CURE, despite the continued propagation of such myths by the uninformed who still mistakenly believe that hysterectomy, pregnancy and/or menopause can "cure" the disease. Invasive surgery remains the gold standard of diagnosis, and current therapies continue to remain extremely limited, often carrying side effects.<br>  <br>  Mistakenly minimized as "painful periods," Endometriosis is more than just "killer cramps." It is a leading cause of female infertility, chronic pelvic pain and gynecologic surgery, and accounts for more than half of the 500,000 hysterectomies performed in the US annually. Despite being more prevalent than breast cancer, Endometriosis continues to be treated as an insignificant ailment. Recent studies have even shown an elevated risk of certain cancers and other serious illnesses in those with the disease, as well as malignant changes within the disease itself.<br>  <br>  Research has shown that genetics, immune system dysfunction, and exposure to environmental toxins like Dioxin may all be contributing factors to the development of the disease. Endometriosis knows no racial or socioeconomic barriers, and can affect women ranging from adolescence to post-menopause. The disease can be so painful as to render a woman or teen unable to care for herself or her family, attend work, school, or social functions, or go about her normal routine. It can negatively affect every aspect of a woman's life; from her self-esteem and relationships, to her capacity to bear children, to her ability to be a contributing member of society.<br>  <br>  The disease can currently only be diagnosed through invasive surgery, and the average delay in diagnosis is a staggering 9 years. A patient may seek the counsel of 5 or more physicians before her pain is adequately addressed. <br>  <br>  Once diagnosed, it is not unusual for a patient to undergo several pelvic surgeries and embark on many different hormonal and medical therapies in an attempt to treat her symptoms. None of the current treatments are entirely effective, and virtually all synthetic therapies carry significantly negative side effects; some lasting far beyond cessation of therapy. The exception to this is excision; see www.centerforendo.com to learn more about excision as the leading treatment.<br>  <br>  Though Endometriosis is one of the most prevalent illnesses affecting society today, awareness is sorely lacking and disease research continues to remain significantly under funded. For instance, in fiscal year 2000, the National Institutes of Health planned to spend $16.5 billion on research. Of that funding, only $2.7 million was earmarked for Endometriosis - amounting to approximately $.40/patient. This is in stark contrast to other illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Lupus, which received approximately $105.00 and $30.00 per patient, respectively. American businesses lose millions of dollars each year in lost productivity and work time because of Endometriosis. The cost of surgery required to diagnose the disease in each patient alone adds greatly to the financial burden of both consumers and companies alike.<br>  <br>  Once erroneously believed to be a disease of “Caucasian career women who have delayed childbearing,” we know that in fact, Endometriosis affects women of all ages, races and<br>  socioeconomic status. Endometriosis also can and does exist in the adolescent female population. Far from the “rare” incidence once believed, studies have found that as many as 70% of teenagers with chronic pelvic pain had Endometriosis proven by laparoscopy. Other reports indicate that as many as 41% of patients experienced Endometriosis pain as an adolescent. The illness can be quite disruptive and cause significant dysfunction, especially at a time in life when self-esteem, school attendance and performance, and social involvement are all critical. Many adolescents with Endometriosis find themselves unable to attend or participate in classes, social functions, extracurricular activities, and sports due to significant pain and other symptoms of Endometriosis. Sometimes, teens and young women lack support and validation from both the home and the school; told the pain is “in their head,” that they are “faking it,” that their debilitating cramps are “normal” and “a part of womanhood,” that they are merely suffering from “the curse,” or that they should just “grin and bear it.” Their symptoms may also be dismissed as a sexually transmitted disease, which Endometriosis absolutely is not. Failure to acknowledge and address symptoms early in the disease process can lead to significant delays in diagnosis and necessary, subsequent treatments. Lack of support from family and loved ones can also add to the patient’s pain and fear - at any age.<br>  <br>  Recent studies have also shown that Endometriosis may in fact have an even bigger impact on younger patients than older women. One such study discovered that in patients under 22 years of age, the rate of disease recurrence was<br>  double that of older women (35% versus 19%). The study also revealed that the disease behaves differently in<br>  younger women; leading some researchers to believe it is a<br>  different form of Endometriosis altogether. Surgery, considered necessary to accurately diagnose and<br>  effectively treat the disease, is often withheld from younger patients based on the injudicious belief that early surgery somehow negatively influences a young woman’s fertility. Extensive, cumulative research has shown this concern to be unfounded. What can impact fertility, however,<br>  is neglecting effective treatment of the disease. Some<br>  researchers also feel that symptomatic, adolescent-onset<br>  Endometriosis is most often a lifelong problem that will<br>  progress to severe fibrotic disease.<br>  <br>  While it is possible to become pregnant with Endometriosis, the key is to obtain early, effective treatment such as that offered by specialty treatment centers like the Center for Endo Care (see www.centerforendo.com to learn about the success of excision as treatment).  Hysterectomy is not a cure for Endometriosis. Any disease left behind by the surgeon (whether by design because he or she 'couldn't get it all' or accident because they don't recognize the disease in all manifestations) will continue to thrive and cause pain and symptoms. It does not matter if the ovaries are removed or if HRT is withheld; Endo produces its own estrogen-synthesizing enzyme known as aromatase. Thus, it enables it's own vicious life cycle and sustains the disease process. You would be better off getting all disease truly excised from all locations at a specialty center like the CEC (www.centerforendo.com).<br>  <br>  Due in part to the efforts of foundations like the ERC, research is ongoing in some places as to the causes of Endometriosis and potential cures for the disease. Our organization will continue to push for more widespread research into the many facets of the disease, and ultimately, a cure.<br>  <br>  For more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.endocenter.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.endocenter.org/</a><br>  <br>  Endo Self Test:<br>  <br>  Not sure if you have Endometriosis?

Talk to your doctor about getting an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment today. Dull aching and cramping can occur during menstruation in many women and teens, due to uterine contractions and the release of various hormones including those known as prostaglandins. However, period pain that becomes so debilitating it renders you unable to go about your normal routine is not ordinary or typical! Pain is your body's way of signaling that something is WRONG. If you are suffering from pelvic pain at any point in your cycle, an Endometriosis diagnosis should be considered.<br>  <br>  Know the Facts:<br>  <br>  - Endometriosis can affect women and teens of all ages, even those as young as 10 or as old as 85!<br>  - Hysterectomy, menopause and pregnancy are NOT cures for Endometriosis; in fact, there is no definitive cure!<br>  - Delayed childbearing is NOT what causes Endometriosis; in fact, no one really knows for sure what causes the disease, but research points to multi-factorial origins like heredity, immunology and exposure to environmental toxicants!<br>  - Endometriosis can only be accurately diagnosed via surgery; diagnostic tests like MRIs and ultrasounds are not definitive!<br>  - GnRH therapies like Lupron should never be administered in those patients younger than 18 yrs. of age or before a surgical diagnosis!<br>  - You CAN live well in spite of Endometriosis.

Just think of it this way, you can't drink TODAY.  Isn't that easy.  Then tomorrow, just remember the same thing.  There really is no good purpose for drinking, but there is for Effexor and Wellbutrin.

If you are taking an anti-depressant why would you want to use alcohol which is a depressant anyway? Kind of defeats the purpose of your medicine. I'm on a MAOI so alcohol will cause a reaction and very possibly kill me with a stroke. I can't have many medicines, bologna, or cheese. Bratwurst sent me to the hospital. There is a whole list I can't have just to be able to be functual and healthy again. I can never have another pizza! That sucks. Be thankful your list is as small as it is.

I am on Effexor XR, which is the extended release form of the drug (taken once in the morning lasts 24 hours). The real reason why alcohol can interfere with medications is that it can affect the timed release (called dose dumping). This is the reason that some people have problems, it's like taking 5 shots of alcohol at once rather than drinking a beer an hour for 5 hours. <br>  <br>  As I mentioned I am taking the drug every morning around 7 AM...I have drank to excess in the late evening (say after 9 PM and had no problems). If you took the drug then immediately had a lot of alcohol and no food the alcohol would probably cause the medicine to release quicker than it should. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to start the medicine for a week or 2 with no booze, then gradually add it, but make sure to always have food in your stomach as well.|`|a2d41693b9a45831851d76692c95bcc7aa	you can socially drink but only in moderation.|`|b29b6fe08f71ff5b7d53163575df3128aa	idk sorry|`|fcf27188a4fa04198d77c618f593855eaa	I was put on Effexor when I was 19 and was on it for about a year and a half.  I was prescribed Effexor for depression, nothing too severe, probably just normal teenage up and downs really.  I was a young, attractive woman.  I was actually diagnosed as "gifted" at a very young age and actually worked as a dancer when I was put on this medication.<br>  <br>  Just like many teenagers I drank off and on.  I had multiple psychotic episodes after drinking while being on Effexor.  I had never had anything like this happen to me ever before.  I had also never been arrested before but was arrested multiple times for totally just freaking out and trying to physically attack my friends.  I rarely could even remember what happened or why it happened, and interestingly most of the episodes happened when I hadn't even drank that much.<br>  <br>  I was put in jail overnight for one of these episodes, and again was taken to jail and then transferred to a psychiatric ward for a week for another episode.  A few weeks later I was in a different psychiatric ward again (because the episode happened in a different police district I was taken to a different hospital) for a week for another psychotic episode.  <br>  <br>  But the worst one came about 3 weeks after the second hospitalization.  I had drunk no more than 3/4 of a bottle of red wine.  I don't remember everything. But here are some flashes of what I remember in the order I recall them: was out in the evening hanging out with friends.  Female friend called me a name, I took it too seriously and we ended up in a physical fight (she wasn't very stable either).  We ended up fighting in the grass on the side of the highway.  My boyfriend at the time and her boyfriend at the time tried to pull us apart, but in my psychotic state I started fighting with my own boyfriend too, who was only trying to help me.  For some reason my focus shifted to him and I was then trying to fight him.  <br>  <br>  Somewhere along the line a police officer showed up who calmed the situation down, but who refused to let me go back with my friends.  He said he would take me to the local precinct where my parents could come pick me up.  I was taken to the police station but wasn't arrested or anything, just given a phone to call my parents to come pick me up.  Well it was about 2 or 3 am and although I did get a hold of my mother, she refused to come get me until morning and hung up on me.  Well since I wasn't being arrested or anything I was free to walk out the door - which I did.  I don't remember the details, but I remember flashes of walking around my small city and even flashes of walking through trash strew filthy allies for some reason.  So for several hours I roamed around the city’s filthy back alleys in a psychotic stupor until the sun came up when I called my mom again, I don't recall from where, a gas station I think.  When I got home I expected to see my boyfriend as he lived with me at my mom's, and although I was still really upset thinking that all of this had happened because of him, I thought it was over and we'd just go to sleep and deal with it all later.  <br>  <br>  Upon arriving home and seeing that he wasn't there, that he was still out with the people who we were with earlier that night who had started the whole mess to begin with, I just got totally enraged and started breaking his CDs and other property.  My mother's husband saw me doing this and tried to physically stop me, this ended up in a physical brawl with him during which my mom called the cops.  They didn't try to help calm me down or talk to me - and this I will never forgive them for, but that's a whole other story.  Well after I heard the cops were coming (who I had just dealt with earlier that morning) I locked myself in the bathroom, thinking that they would just go away if I said everything was fine and that I was calm.  Well they refused to leave me alone and since I had destroyed property they said I had to go to jail.  I refused to leave the locked bathroom, and at that point recall saying if you don't leave me alone I'll kill myself, although I had no intention of doing so.  I just wanted to be left alone and certainly didn't want to go to jail.  <br>  <br>  I remember holding the full length mirror in the bathroom in front of me (it was one of those cheap ones that you bolt to the back of a door but it was just normally leaning up against the wall) because the police were threatening to break the door down and I thought if they saw me clutching a large glass mirror they wouldn't just drag me out.  Well they broke the door down not believing (I guess) that I really was clutching a mirror and they rushed at me so fast the they ended up pushing me back into the bathtub where the mirror shattered all over me.  I was cut in at least 12 places, 6-7 of which were very deep and serious and needed stitches, but they still kept dragging me out of the bathroom, glass everywhere that continued to cut me up.  I was still resisting, bleeding everywhere, all over the living room and bathroom (so bad that my parents had to replace the entire carpeting in the bathroom and living room and the rest of the house to match), and then they sprayed me in the face multiple times with pepper spray.  My face had a very deep two and a half inch gash in my left cheek; my chin had a very deep one inch jagged cut and another deep half inch one on my chin as well, and I was still sprayed with pepper spray multiple times.<br>  <br>  Of course EMS got called and I don't remember much about what happened after being sprayed.  Next thing I remember I'm tied down to a hospital bed having the 2 1/2 inch gash in my cheek stitched up.  I just wanted to be left alone and was screaming for them to stop, they continued with that cut, for which I am now thankful.  But since I was screaming that I just wanted to be left alone right then, they agreed to transfer me up to the psychiatric ward to rest for a little while and calm down before I got the rest of my cuts sewn up.  So apparently I just fell asleep immediately upon arriving in the psych ward and laying down in my bed.  I was woken up a little while later and told that if my other wounds were to be sewn up that they needed to do it right then, that there's only a certain amount of time between when you get a cut and when it can be sutured, and that if they don't get sewn up and are left open to heal that they are going to leave much worse scars.  Even though these were very deep, serious wounds on my arms, chest and chin, I refused.  In the still delirious state I was in I just wanted to be left alone.<br>  <br>  I was in the hospital for a week again this time, actually the same place I was at the first time I was put in a psych ward a couple of months before.  Discharged I was told to continue taking the Effexor, which I did for a couple of months.  A few weeks after this last incident I decided that I had to get away from the small North Carolina town I was living in, away from the strained relationships I had with my family as a result of the major episode, and away from the people who I was friends with who started it and away from everyone who was gossiping about me now.  <br>  <br>  I wasn't supposed to go anywhere even though I was a 19 year old adult, but I had my own car and one day I packed up my bags and left while my mom and step dad were at work.  I told my boyfriend about it, and he agreed that it would do me good to get away.  So I moved to Atlanta (had friends there, had been there previously many times) and very soon thereafter I was introduced to heroin by a "friend".  Soon after starting the heroin I stopped the Effexor completely, and interestingly had no more episodes, but became a heroin addict instead for the next 4 years.  The best part about the heroin was that it numbed the pain, made me not care and hurt so much about all the scars I now had, which made me want to be on it as much as possible.  I knew I would get addicted if I continued but at the time I thought better to be addicted to heroin than to feel the pain.<br>  <br>  The end result of all this?  After many years of utter hell I thankfully I've been completely clean off of heroin since October 31, 2003.  The cut on my face which was stitched up is still visible as a slight indentation, but the others which weren't stitched are still quite visible, but thankfully no longer the burning red color they were for a long time.  My relationship with my family is decent, but I know that the last episode permanently changed the way my family and I interact.  I try very hard with them and we’re friendly, but I think our relationship will always be strained because of what happened.  I rarely drink at all anymore, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once every 6 months and a glass of champagne at New Years, but that's about it.  I'm not on any antidepressants and haven't been for years, and I will never, ever get on them ever again.  Sometimes when I get depressed, and I still do occasionally, I distract myself with something that makes me happy - reading or picking up a new book, playing a game on the computer, taking a walk, or playing with my 10 month old son or loving husband who I've been married to for 4 years as of this July 22nd.<br>  <br>  I know this has been a long rambling story.  It's late and I'm tired but I just wanted to share with you how very serious the risks are of drinking while taking Effexor, or any anti-depressant for that matter, but mostly importantly Effexor.  You absolutely cannot safely drink AT ALL while on Effexor, not even one beer or glass of wine.  All of this happened when I was 19.  I'm 26 now and my life is so much different and so wonderful and so amazing, but I’ve worked incredibly hard to get where I am now and there are times when I'm still haunted by what happened to me.  Like I said I never had anything like that happen to me before I started taking Effexor and drinking and never had it happen again after I stopped.<br>  <br>  As far as the Effexor itself goes, if your depression isn't that serious, I would recommend trying other alternatives.  But of course I'm not a doctor, I don't know you or what's best for you treatment wise, but I do know that when you're told you can't drink while taking Effexor, you better take it seriously.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions please feel free to contact me.

At night I can get drowsy too, but try to fight off sleep, sometimes not successfully. Now  for your question, it's generally considered that most people have a hard time staying awake in the afternoon, that would be 1200-1400 hours, if that's afternoon, and of course, at a time when they have an established bedtime, whatever time that might be. Some may even get sleepy as soon as it gets dark, hearkening back to a earlier age of man when we were all more or less diurnal, dividing activity and sleep equally between daylight and night.

Your problem is probably you pulled a muscle too hard, and that place wasn't reluxed.

I What causes it? I Is it common? I What are the symptoms? I How is it diagnosed? I How is it treated? I Complications associated with bacterial vaginosis I Does my partner need to be treated? I Preventing recurrences | Links you can use<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  What is bacterial vaginosis?<br>  Bacterial vaginosis is an overgrowth of several bacteria that normally exist in the vagina. In the past, bacterial vaginosis was called nonspecific vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, Haemophilus vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, and anaerobic vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is generally not thought to be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), because it occurs in women who are not sexually active. We include it here because it is more common in women who are sexually active and because the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis can be similar to the symptoms of other STIs.<br>  <br>  What causes it?<br>  The exact cause of bacterial vaginosis is unknown. There could be a variety of causes. No single organism causes it. It is a condition in which the natural balance of organisms found in the vagina changes. The healthy vagina normally contains a variety of bacteria. One kind of bacteria, known as lactobacillus, is particularly important. Lactobacilli keep the vagina slightly acidic to help reduce the growth of potentially harmful organisms. Women who have bacterial vaginosis lose this protection and have both a large increase in the number of potentially harmful bacteria and a large decrease in the numbers of normal, protective lactobacilli in their vagina. This change in numbers and kinds of bacteria is believed to be the cause of bacterial vaginosis.<br>  <br>  Is it common?<br>  Bacterial vaginosis is widely believed to be even more common than yeast infections. It is the most frequently occurring vaginal infection affecting from 10% to 64% of the female population at any given time.<br>  <br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  Nearly half of all women with bacterial vaginosis will experience no symptoms at all. When a woman has symptoms, the most common complaint is a foul or "fishy" smelling vaginal odor. This odor frequently increases following intercourse. In a recent survey of medical providers, more than half said that the most common complaint from women with bacterial vaginosis is vaginal odor. Another common symptom is an excessive white or gray discharge with a milk-like consistency that can stain undergarments.<br>  <br>  How is it diagnosed?<br>  A medical provider can detect bacterial vaginosis by examining vaginal secretions under a microscope and checking pH. Occasionally, bacterial vaginosis will be incidentally picked up on a routine Pap smear. <br>  <br>  How is it treated?<br>  Your medical provider may prescribe a medicine you can use vaginally for a prescribed length of time. Sometimes bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral medications. It is important to take the medicine as directed and to abstain from sexual contact until the treatment is completed.<br>  <br>  Are there any complications associated with bacterial vaginosis?<br>  Women with bacterial vaginosis may have increased risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, a condition which may require hospitalization. Complications, including infertility, pelvic pain and ectopic pregnancy, may also occur with pelvic inflammatory disease. There is also an increased risk of developing bacterial vaginosis following gynecological surgery.<br>  <br>  Does my partner need to be treated?<br>  Since bacterial vaginosis is not thought to be caused by sexual intercourse, most medical providers will not treat your sexual partner. If your infection should return, your medical provider may recommend treating your partner.<br>  <br>  What can I do to help prevent recurrences?<br>  As with yeast infections and the common cold, many women will experience recurrences of bacterial vaginosis. It is unclear why or how these recurrences or relapses occur. Some general suggestions for good vaginal health include:<br>  <br>  Avoid spreading bacteria from the rectum to the vagina. After a bowel movement, wipe from front to back, away from the vagina. <br>  Clean the vulva thoroughly and keep it dry <br>  Avoid douching and using irritating agents such as feminine hygiene sprays and harsh soaps. <br>  Avoid tight jeans, panty hose without a cotton crotch or other clothing that can trap moisture.|`|fa8aa448b1962f6108c85535741cda59aa	Your should use a condom as the bacteria can spread to under the foreskin of the penis of down the urethra. Avoid oral contact to the vagina, and make sure your partner washes his hands after touching the area. If you're on medication continue to take it as prescribed. Believe it or not sunlight to the area can help, however it depends how comfortable you are sitting in the sun with your vagina exposed to the sunlight.|`|65ce69d047ba662f8a19a3ca4993134caa	You don't know the exact source of infection, don't know the type of germ you have, don't know if your partner has another infection, even if it's a slight one will worsen yours because your normal vaginal flora is out of balance, so if you're going to have sex ,protect yourself and your partner, otherwise, get treatment first !|`|da3743e3216b3c198de8581eda80cca3aa	better not josie grossie<br>  nobody wants your stinky bird infection juice all over them

Research has proven that all diseases are curable but the drug companies and medical community do not want the truth to be known, as it is so much more profitable to treat a chronic condition, than to cure it, outright. And, yes this include all diseases, cancers, HIV, AIDS, all of them are curable. But no one has any vested interest in curing them for their patients in mainstream medicine. But, the truth remains, they are curable. See the book, "The Cure For All Diseases," by Dr. Hulda R. Clark, Ph.D., N.D. This lady is a medical genius, but she is a research scientist and she dicovered that there are only two cause of diseases; Toxins and Parasites.

You could just start off with walking slowly then increase your walking pace then jog slowly and increase your pace. Also remember to stretch, do some push ups and sit ups. other than running you can cycle, swim, climb, Anything that you want to do. Also if you don't eat right then you will be exercising in vain. If you eat more food especially junk food in a large quantity then you won't be burning any calories to get in shape, so therefore you need to eat healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables etc.|`|1445b39e733521523f7251858e2a1ff3aa	Eat healty and work out|`|3e90b89770ef8e563fc00df6e4c85931aa	diet & exercise.|`|61f2be0418df1224c49386a764160b7daa	exercise lol|`|7fb94d0f687511197b9e47d7047bda18aa	exercise|`|82f02fab5a13dc64f5149a9c6f3de745aa	The Best Exercises To Lose Weight<br>  <a href="http://www.askaquery.com/question/The-Best-Exercises-To-Lose-Weight.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askaquery.com/question/The-Be...</a>|`|da89e74f9c686eada2c25c43bc94ead3aa	DRINK LEMON AND GINGER BEFORE GOING TO BED|`|58e37d517ee1c00376f7fddeaa71cf1faa	eat right(most of the time if not all, as its nice to treat yourself sometimes otherwise eating perfectly is like torture....unless that is what you like)<br>  Exercise...if you're not into the whole gym thing then go do an activity you like..your brain will enjoy it more|`|674dbf403cf79e9b08087a310d7e533caa	work out and a balance diet.

Number one, you need to stop using the hand to type/play video games, etc. for several days. Talk to a pharmacist about a proper splint to wear for your wrist. Wearing the wrist splint at night while you sleep will help alot. You can use some minor over the counter analgesics for pain. But the main thing is to stop the offending activity that is causing the swelling around the nerves and causing the pain. If stopping the computer, etc for a week and wearing the splint does not help, I would see a family doctor about it.<br>  <br>  -- you should do some reading about carpel tunnel and its causes. because it involves nerves in your wrist and hand, some home remedies such as hot wax will not do anything, because it cannot reach into the nerves. That is more an arthritis remedy, and one that should be taken with extreme caution, because wax can be flammable.|`|7babb8722f1e9a55e9572338eb82caf3aa	You should be taking PC-95, MSM, FP-63 and Epithelial Tissue Support.

You are better off doing dumbbell chest presses.  <br>  <br>  Always start with the exercise that puts the most weight in the most unbalanced position.  The minor muscles that balance the weights are the first to go.  So many will start with the dumbbell chest press, then do the barbell chest press and then finish with the machine chest press.  There is no balance needed on the machine chest press so you are only working your core chest muscles.

The term erectile dysfunction covers a range of disorders, but usually refers to the inability to obtain an adequate erection for satisfactory sexual activity.<br>  Although erectile dysfunction, formerly called impotence, is more common in men older than 65, it can occur at any age. An occasional episode of erectile dysfunction happens to most men and is normal. As men age, it's also normal to experience changes in erectile function. Erections may take longer to develop, may not be as rigid or may require more direct stimulation to be achieved. Men may also notice that orgasms are less intense, the volume of ejaculate is reduced and recovery time increases between erections.<br>  When erectile dysfunction proves to be a pattern or a persistent problem, it can interfere with a man's self-image as well as his and his partner's sexual life. Erectile dysfunction may also be a sign of a physical or emotional problem that requires treatment.<br>  Erectile dysfunction was once a taboo subject, but more men are seeking help. Doctors are gaining a better understanding of what causes erectile dysfunction and are finding new and better treatments.<br>  Signs and symptoms<br>  Patterns of erectile dysfunction include:<br>  ·Occasional inability to obtain a full erection<br>  ·Inability to maintain an erection throughout intercourse<br>  ·Complete inability to achieve an erection<br>  Causes<br>   <br>  CLICK TO ENLARGE<br>   Male reproductive system <br>   <br>  The penis contains two cylindrical, sponge-like structures that run along its length, parallel to the tube that carries semen and urine (urethra). When a man becomes sexually aroused, nerve impulses cause the blood flow to the cylinders to increase about seven times the normal amount. This sudden influx of blood expands the sponge-like structures and produces an erection by straightening and stiffening the penis. Continued sexual arousal or excitation maintains the higher rate of blood flow, keeping the erection firm. After ejaculation, or when the sexual excitation passes, the excess blood drains out of the spongy tissue, and the penis returns to its nonerect size and shape.<br>  Specific steps take place to produce and sustain an erection:<br>  ·Arousal. The first step is sexual arousal, which men obtain from the senses of sight, touch, hearing and smell, and from thoughts.<br>  ·Nervous system response. The brain communicates the sexual excitation to the body's nervous system, which activates increased blood flow to the penis.<br>  ·Blood vessel response. A relaxing action occurs in the blood vessels that supply the penis, allowing more blood to flow into the shafts that produce the erection.<br>  If something affects any of these factors or the delicate balance among them, erectile dysfunction can result.<br>  Nonphysical causes<br>  Nonphysical causes may account for impotence. They may include:<br>  ·Psychological problems. The most common nonphysical causes are stress, anxiety and fatigue. Impotence is also an occasional side effect of psychological problems such as depression.<br>  ·Negative feelings. Feelings that you express toward your sexual partner — or that are expressed by your sexual partner — such as resentment, hostility or lack of interest also can be a factor in erectile dysfunction.<br>  Physical causes<br>  Physical causes account for many cases of erectile dysfunction and may include:<br>  ·Nerve damage from longstanding diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)<br>  ·Cardiovascular disorders affecting the blood supply to the pelvis<br>  ·Certain prescription medications<br>  ·Operations for cancer of the prostate<br>  ·Fractures that injure the spinal cord<br>  ·Multiple sclerosis<br>  ·Hormonal disorders<br>  ·Alcoholism and other forms of drug abuse<br>  In fact, erectile dysfunction may be one of the first signs of an underlying medical problem.<br>  The physical and nonphysical causes of erectile dysfunction commonly interact. For instance, a minor physical problem that slows sexual response may cause anxiety about attaining an erection. Then the anxiety can worsen your erectile dysfunction.<br>  Risk factors<br>  A wide variety of physical and emotional risk factors can contribute to erectile dysfunction. They include:<br>  ·Physical diseases and disorders. Chronic diseases of the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, nerves, arteries or veins can lead to impotence. So can endocrine system disorders, particularly diabetes. The accumulation of deposits (plaques) in your arteries (atherosclerosis) also can prevent adequate blood from entering the penis. And in some men, erectile dysfunction may be caused by low levels of the hormone testosterone (male hypogonadism).<br>  ·Surgery or trauma. Damage to the nerves that control erections can cause erectile dysfunction. It may result from an injury to the pelvic area or spinal cord. Surgery to treat bladder, rectal or prostate cancer also can result in erectile dysfunction. Prolonged bicycle riding also can cause a temporary problem.<br>  ·Medications. A wide range of drugs — including antidepressants, antihistamines and medications to treat high blood pressure, pain and prostate cancer — can cause erectile dysfunction by interfering with nerve impulses or blood flow to the penis. Tranquilizers and sleeping aids also may pose a problem.<br>  ·Substance abuse. Chronic use of alcohol, marijuana or other drugs often causes erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual drive. Excessive tobacco use also can damage penile arteries.<br>  ·Stress, anxiety or depression. Psychological conditions also contribute to some cases of erectile dysfunction.<br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  It's normal to experience erectile dysfunction on occasion. But if erectile dysfunction lasts longer than two months or is a recurring problem, see your doctor for a physical exam or for a referral to a doctor who specializes in erectile problems. Your own doctor or a specialist can help you determine the underlying cause or causes of erectile dysfunction and then help you find the right type of treatment.<br>  Although you might view erectile dysfunction as a personal or embarrassing problem, it's important to seek treatment. In many cases, erectile dysfunction can be successfully treated. Also, see your doctor if the therapy or medication prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction isn't working for you. Don't try to combine medications or therapies on your own or deviate from prescribed doses.<br>  Screening and diagnosis<br>  Your doctor will want to ask questions about how and when your condition developed, the medications you take and any other physical conditions you may have. Your doctor will also want to discuss recent physical or emotional changes.<br>  If your doctor suspects that physical causes are involved, he or she will likely want to take blood tests to check your level of male hormones and for other potential medical problems, such as diabetes. Your doctor may also want to try eliminating or replacing certain prescription drugs you're taking one at a time to see whether any are responsible for erectile dysfunction.<br>  More specialized tests may include:<br>  ·Ultrasonography. This test can determine the adequacy of arterial circulation in your genital organs. Ultrasonography involves using a wand-like device (transducer) held over the blood vessels that supply the penis. The transducer emits sound waves that pass through body tissues and reflect back, producing an image to let your doctor see if your blood flow is impaired. The test often is done before and after injection of medication to see if there's an improvement in blood flow.<br>  ·Neurologic evaluation. Your doctor usually assesses possible nerve damage by conducting a physical examination to test for normal touch sensation in your genital area.<br>  ·Cavernosometry and cavernosography. Cavernosometry is a test that measures penile vascular pressure. Cavernosography involves injecting a dye into your blood vessels to permit your doctor to view any possible abnormalities in blood flow into and out of your penis.<br>  If your doctor suspects that mainly nonphysical causes are to blame, he or she may ask whether you obtain erections during masturbation, with a partner or while you sleep. Most men experience many erections, without remembering them, during sleep. A simple test that involves wrapping a special perforated tape around your penis before going to sleep can confirm whether you have nocturnal erections. If the tape is separated in the morning, your penis was erect at some time during the night. Tests of this type confirm that there is not a physical abnormality causing erectile dysfunction, and that the cause is likely psychological.<br>  Treatment<br>  A wide variety of options exist for treating erectile dysfunction. They include everything from medications and simple mechanical devices to surgery and psychological counseling. The cause and severity of your condition are important factors in determining the best treatment or combination of treatments for you. You and your doctor may also want to consider how much money you're willing to spend and the personal preferences of you and your partner. If erectile dysfunction is the result of a medical condition, the cost of treatment may be covered by insurance.<br>  Oral medications<br>  Oral medications available to treat ED include:<br>  ·Sildenafil (Viagra)<br>  ·Tadalafil (Cialis)<br>  ·Vardenafil (Levitra)<br>  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Viagra in 1998, and it became the first oral medication for erectile dysfunction on the market. Since then, Levitra and Cialis have been approved, providing more options for oral therapy.<br>  Viagra, Levitra and Cialis work in much the same way. Chemically known as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, these drugs enhance the effects of nitric oxide, a chemical messenger that relaxes smooth muscles in the penis. This increases the amount of blood and allows a natural sequence to occur — an erection in response to sexual stimulation. These medications don't automatically produce an erection. Instead they allow an erection to occur after physical and psychological stimulation. Many men experience improvement in erectile function after taking these medications regardless of the cause of their impotence.<br>  These medications share many similarities, but they have differences as well. They vary in dosage, duration of effectiveness and possible side effects. Other distinctions — for example, which drug is best for certain types of men — aren't yet known. No study has directly compared these three medications.<br>  Not all men benefit<br>  Although these medications can help many people, not all men can or should take them to treat erectile dysfunction. If you've had a heart attack, stroke or life-threatening heart rhythm during the last six months, don't take these medications. If you've been told that sexual activity could trigger a cardiac event, discuss other options with your doctor. In addition, don't take Viagra, Levitra or Cialis with nitrate medications, such as the heart drugs nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid, others), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur) and isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil). The combination of these medications, which work to widen (dilate) blood vessels, can cause dizziness, low blood pressure, and circulation and heart problems.<br>  Don't expect these medications to fix your impotence immediately. Dosages may need adjusting. Or you may need to alter when you take the medication. Before taking any medication, make sure to discuss with your doctor its potential benefits and side effects.<br>  Prostaglandin E (alprostadil)<br>  Two treatments involve using a drug called alprostadil (al-PROS-tuh-dil). Alprostadil is a synthetic version of the hormone prostaglandin E. The hormone helps relax smooth muscle tissue in the penis, which enhances the blood flow needed for an erection. There are two ways to use alprostadil:<br>  ·Needle-injection therapy. With this method, you use a fine needle to inject alprostadil (Caverject, Edex) into the base or side of your penis. This generally produces an erection in five to 20 minutes that lasts about an hour. Because the injection goes directly into the spongy cylinders that fill with blood, alprostadil is an effective treatment for many men. And because the needle used is so fine, pain from the injection site is usually minor. Other side effects may include bleeding from the injection, prolonged erection and formation of fibrous tissue at the injection site. The cost per injection can be expensive. Injecting a mixture of alprostadil and other prescribed drugs may be a less expensive and more effective option. These other drugs may include papaverine and phentolamine (Regitine).<br>  ·Self-administered intraurethral therapy. This method's trade name is Medicated Urethral System for Erection (MUSE). It involves using a disposable applicator to insert a tiny suppository, about half the size of a grain of rice, into the tip of your penis. The suppository, placed about two inches into your urethra, is absorbed by erectile tissue in your penis, increasing the blood flow that causes an erection. Although needles aren't involved, you may still find this method painful or uncomfortable. Side effects may include pain, minor bleeding in the urethra, dizziness and formation of fibrous tissue.<br>  Hormone replacement therapy<br>  For the small number of men who have testosterone deficiency, testosterone replacement therapy may be an option.<br>  Vacuum devices<br>  This treatment involves the use of an external vacuum and one or more rubber bands (tension rings). To begin you place a hollow plastic tube, available by prescription, over your penis. You then use a hand pump to create a vacuum in the tube and pull blood into the penis. Once you achieve an adequate erection, you slip a tension ring around the base of your penis to maintain the erection. You then remove the vacuum device. The erection typically lasts long enough for a couple to have adequate sexual relations. You remove the tension ring after intercourse.<br>  Vascular surgery<br>  This treatment is usually reserved for men whose blood flow has been blocked by an injury to the penis or pelvic area. Surgery may also be used to correct erectile dysfunction caused by vascular blockages. The goal of this treatment is to correct a blockage of blood flow to the penis so that erections can occur naturally. But the long-term success of this surgery is unclear.<br>  Penile implants<br>  This treatment involves surgically placing a device into the two sides of the penis, allowing erection to occur as often and for as long as desired. These implants consist of either an inflatable device or semirigid rods made from silicone or polyurethane. This treatment is often expensive and is usually not recommended until other methods have been considered or tried first. As with any surgery, there is a small risk of complications such as infection.<br>  Psychological counseling<br>  If stress, anxiety or depression is the cause of your erectile dysfunction, your doctor may suggest that you, or you and your partner, visit a psychologist or psychiatrist with experience in treating sexual problems.<br>  Prevention<br>  Although most men experience episodes of erectile dysfunction from time to time, you can take these steps to decrease the likelihood of occurrences:<br>  ·Limit or avoid the use of alcohol and other similar drugs.<br>  ·Stop smoking.<br>  ·Exercise regularly.<br>  ·Reduce stress.<br>  ·Get enough sleep.<br>  ·Deal with anxiety or depression.<br>  ·See your doctor for regular checkups and medical screening tests.<br>  Coping skills<br>  Whether the cause is physical factors or psychological factors or a combination of both, erectile dysfunction can become a source of mental and emotional stress for a man — and his partner. If you experience erectile dysfunction only on occasion, try not to assume that you have a permanent problem or to expect it to happen again during your next sexual encounter. Don't view one episode of erectile dysfunction as a lasting comment on your health, virility or masculinity.<br>  In addition, if you experience occasional or persistent erectile dysfunction, remember your sexual partner. Your partner may see your inability to have an erection as a sign of diminished sexual desire. Your reassurance that this is not the case can be helpful in this situation.<br>  To appropriately treat erectile dysfunction and strengthen your relationship with your partner, try to communicate openly and honestly about your condition. Couples may also want to seek counseling to confront any concerns they may have about erectile dysfunction and to learn how to discuss their feelings. Try to maintain this communication throughout the diagnosis and treatment process. In fact, treatment is often more successful if couples work together as a team.<br>    <br>  <br>   <br>  By Mayo Clinic Staff <br>  Jan 18, 2006 <br>  ? 1998-2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

c1301e4af8c6c803814eb26eb9f98035aa	I am not a doctor but I do read and do self study. I am glad to see that you are looking at natural means to help CURE your condition and not just blindly following the advice of "the chemical" medication doctors. First, let me say that you can cure your conditions all together, even though I know that you have been told otherwise. Buy a book called, "The Cure For All Diseases," by Dr. Hulda R. Clark, Ph.D., N.D. (See the links below.) And, get yourself a Zapper or a Parazapper that Dr. Clark invented, and use it on a regular basis !!! There are only two causes of diseases, Toxins and Parasites, and you can learn what is causing your conditions and kill off the parasites and learn to avoid (and cleanse out of you, also) the toxins. I also, regularly use an herbal product called Swedish Bitters, which has been around for at least 400 years or more. It is simply a combination of different herbs and is very bitter, but very effective as well. It can be used on the eyes (with clean cotton balls) and it helps to kill off parasites that can cause us to get sick as well. (Dr. Clark recommends others in her books, but she acknowledges that there are possibly many different herbs and combinations thereof that can help to remove toxins and parasites from the body.) Godspeed to you in finding out what is causing, and curing, your conditions.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	Consider looking into supplements such as those from Melaleuca.  You can get more info at their website.  Lutein is good for the eyes, a good multivitamin and antioxidant supplement is a must for increased energy; to build up your immune system and St Johns wart is good for depression.  The company mentioned has supplements that contain those things as well as other supplements that are very helpful.  Good Luck.

Here’s the lowdown for any guy who’s ever worried about whether his penis is a normal size. <br>  There’s a fairly wide range of normal penis sizes - just as there is for every other body part. And just like other parts of the body, how a penis appears at different stages of a guy’s life varies quite a bit. You wouldn’t expect someone who is 11 years old to look the same as someone who’s 19.<br>  Guys normally develop at different times. Some may start developing as early as 9. Others may not start developing until 15 or even later. The age at which a guy starts to grow varies from person to person. It all depends on when he enters puberty and his hormones start doing their thing. <br>  Growth in penis size is just one part of puberty, which also includes such changes as pubic hair development, testicular growth, muscle development, and a growth spurt. Late starters almost always catch up fine - they just reach full maturity a little later. <br>  Penises come in different sizes, shapes, and colors. These traits are hereditary, like eye color or foot size, and there’s nothing you can do to change them. Despite what you may hear or read, no special exercises, supplements, or diets will speed up the development process or change a guy’s size. Also, like his feet, a guy’s penis may appear smaller to him just because the perspective is different when he’s looking down. And there’s a lot less difference in penis size between guys when they get an erection (a “*****” or “hard on”) than when their penises are relaxed.<br>  In addition to size, guys also wonder about other aspects of how their penises look, such as whether the skin covering the penis is normal or if it’s OK for a guy’s penis to hang to the left or right (it is!). If you’re concerned about how your penis looks, ask your doctor. Guys who are reaching puberty should have regular testicular exams, so that’s a good time to ask your doctor any questions. <br>  Taking a ride on the hormonal roller-coaster means lots of changes - and a lot of common worries - for both guys and girls. Just as guys may wonder about how their penises develop, lots of girls ask the same thing about their breasts. <br>  If you’re wondering about your development, don’t try to compare yourself to your older brother or your best friend - they’re probably at a different stage of development than you are anyway. The important thing to remember is that it’s OK to not be a mirror image of the guy at the next urinal. <br>  Get out the tweezers and the microscope :)<br>  <br>  You probably have a good sense of where you fit in the distribution of size for<br>  more commonly visible measurements of body size: height, size of hands, feet,<br>  weight and so on. However, unless you spend a lot of time in a nudist<br>  environment, there are, understandably other measurements for which you don’t<br>  have a good sense of where you fit. Penis size is an obvious example. It’s also<br>  one that can make a lot of people uncomfortable. They worry about whether they<br>  are abnormal, “too small,” “too large,” and so on. As with most characteristics<br>  of human anatomy, there is a lot of individual variation. You can differ<br>  substantially from average without being unusual or freakish and without any<br>  need for concern or medical intervention. If you have concerns, by all means<br>  consult a doctor, but chances are good that you have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there is always a fascination with people who are<br>  significantly different for the normal range. This applies to height and<br>  weight, size of hands and feet, and, yes, also to penis size. So what<br>  is “normal”? Surprisingly, perhaps, given how common concerns about penis size<br>  seem to be, there are very little good data based on large samples. There are<br>  data, though, and the numbers seem to agree well enough to suggest that the<br>  sample size must be large enough to give reasonably accurate measures of<br>  averages and distributions.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are additional links there to other studies as well.<br>  <br>  The average length of an erect penis (measured along the top) is 16.1 cm (6.34<br>  in).<br>  90% of measurements fall between 10 and 21 cm (4 and 8.25 in).<br>  The average girth of an erect penis is 12.3 cm (4.84 in).<br>  The average length of the flaccid penis is about 9 cm (3.5 in) with most<br>  measurements falling between 5 cm (2 in) and 12.5 cm (5 in).<br>  <br>  These numbers appear to be approximately independent of such parameters as age<br>  (post-puberty) and nationality despite any anecdotal information you may have<br>  heard to the contrary, though reliable data on such variations is quite limited.<br>  <br>  You can decide what “big” is, but just as you probably wouldn’t particularly<br>  label someone as “tall” unless they were in the top few percent, you probably<br>  wouldn’t want to label someone’s penis as “big” unless it was larger than the<br>  normal ranges quoted above (greater than 21 cm erect length, 12.5 cm flaccid<br>  length). There also appears to be a large variability in the ratio of the erect<br>  length to flaccid length. Average is about 1.8, but ratios from about 1 to 4<br>  are not uncommon.<br>  <br>  You can turn up a lot of additional reading material on this subject with a Google search :<br>  <br>  Average penis size<br>  <br>  I hope this information helps you to better understand what is “normal”<br>  and “big.” Again, if you have concerns, consult your doctor. You may also see<br>  many advertisements for companies that claim to help you increase penis size. I<br>  would caution you against considering their services because of questionable<br>  efficacy in many cases, and because it is unlikely that there is any real<br>  reason why you should need to change your size.<br>  <br>  Your penis is too big, if your woman says it hurts her.<br>  But not all woman can take the same size of penis.<br>  So, the conclusion is:<br>  -If your partner says it is too big, then it is. For her/him.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coolnurse.com/penis_size.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolnurse.com/penis_size.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/penis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.teenhealthfx.com/answers/sex-39.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenhealthfx.com/answers/sex-...</a><br>  <br>  Beware of penis-enlargement scams<br>  Considering penis enlargement? Don't waste your money on ineffective and possibly dangerous male-enhancement pills, pumps, exercises and surgeries. <br>  If you've seen the "Austin Powers" movies, you may have laughed at Austin for owning a penis-enlargement pump. But you also may have been thinking, "Hmm. I wonder if something like that could give me an extra inch or two."<br>  Penis-enlargement products aren't difficult to find. Men's magazines, sports radio shows and Internet sites are filled with advertisements for pumps, pills, weights, exercises and surgeries — all of which supposedly can increase the length and width (girth) of your penis. Even if you've never visited an Internet porn site, you've likely received many unsolicited e-mails for products and services that promise to make you more of a man.<br>  These come-ons are based on several stereotypes about men's insecurities. The "male enhancement" industry assumes that every man:<br>  ·Is afraid he has a small penis<br>  ·Believes he'd be a better lover if he had a bigger penis<br>  ·Is looking for a way to safely and effectively increase his penis size<br>  Don't fall for it. No scientific research supports the use of any nonsurgical method to enlarge the penis, and no reputable medical society endorses penis-enlargement surgery performed for purely cosmetic reasons. Because many of these techniques can damage your penis and even cause impotence, think twice before trying any of them.<br>  Penis size: What's normal, what's not?<br>  When you were a boy, a locker room bully may have taunted you about the size of your penis. As you compared yourself with other boys in the shower, you may have concluded that he was right. A cylinder-shaped object such as a penis always looks smaller when viewed from above than it does when viewed from the side.<br>  As you grew older, you may have seen super-sized penises in X-rated movies and magazines. Such experiences may have left you with a distorted image of what's normal and what's not.<br>  Most likely, your size is perfectly normal. Research shows that more than 70 percent of men have penises that measure between 5 and 7 inches when erect. A penis is considered abnormally small only if it measures less than 3 inches when erect, and even then it might not matter. Researchers have documented many cases in which men with so-called micropenises have been fully capable of having sex and fathering children.<br>  The partner perspective: How they view penis size<br>  E-mail advertisements would have you believe that women care deeply about penis size. But women responding to magazine surveys say they don't care about size at all.<br>  What's the truth? A Dutch study of 375 sexually active women who had recently given birth suggests that the surveys are accurate — to a point. Seventy-nine percent of the women said that penis length is unimportant, and 69 percent of them said the same about penis girth.<br>  E-mail advertisements would also have you believe that gay men are obsessed with penis size. But individual preferences vary. Average penis size is the same in both gay and straight men.<br>  So, unless your partner tells you otherwise, it's probably safe to assume that you're fine just the way you are. Understanding your partner's physical and emotional needs and desires may do far more to improve your sexual relationship than would changing the size of your penis.<br>  Nonsurgical methods of penis enlargement<br>  Marketers offer many different types of nonsurgical penis enlargement, and often promote them with serious-looking advertisements that include endorsements from "scientific" researchers.<br>  But if you look and read closely, you'll see that claims of safety and effectiveness are completely groundless. Because no reputable scientific research validates any type of nonsurgical penis enlargement, marketers rely on testimonials and before-and-after photos that may not be authentic.<br>  At the bottom of such advertisements, you'll usually find a sentence such as "These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration." Well, of course they haven't been. The Food and Drug Administration, the government agency that regulates medications and medical devices, has never approved any medications or devices for enlarging a penis.<br>  There are four basic types of nonsurgical penis enlargement:<br>  ·Manual stretching or squeezing (jelquing). These exercises are supposed to be performed 30 minutes a day for an indefinite period of time. Although they may be safer than other methods, they can lead to scar formation, pain and disfigurement.<br>  ·Stretching with penile weights. This technique is very likely to cause permanent penile damage.<br>  ·Vacuum pumps. Because pumps draw blood into the penis and make it swell, they're useful in the treatment of impotence (erectile dysfunction). This may create an illusion of a larger penis, but results are seldom permanent. Repeated use can damage elastic tissue in the penis, leading to less-firm erections.<br>  ·Pills and lotions. These usually contain vitamins, minerals, herbs or hormones such as testosterone. Although topical testosterone is sometimes used on adolescent boys to accelerate puberty, there's no evidence that it or any other substance can increase penis size in adult men. In 2002, authorities in the state of Arizona seized the assets of a penis-pill company, in part because the owners fraudulently claimed their product would deliver a permanent gain of 1 to 3 inches. The company owners also refused to honor their money-back guarantee, committing yet another fraud.<br>   <br>  MORE ON THIS TOPIC<br>  ·Complementary and alternative medicine: Evaluate claims of treatment success<br>  ·Erectile dysfunction<br>  ·Erectile dysfunction quiz: Don't suffer in silence<br>   <br>  Surgical methods of penis enlargement<br>   <br>  CLICK TO ENLARGE<br>   Suspensory ligament <br>   <br>  Cosmetic surgeons have developed several different enlargement techniques, none of them endorsed by medical organizations. The American Urological Association, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons have all issued policy statements against cosmetic surgical procedures to enhance the penis.<br>  To lengthen a penis, surgery typically involves snipping the suspensory ligament that attaches the penis to the pubic bone and moving skin from the abdomen to the penile shaft. The suspensory ligament stabilizes and gives an upward tilt to an erect penis.<br>  When this ligament is cut, the penis may look longer because more of it hangs outside the body. But cutting the suspensory ligament can cause an erect penis to wobble and position itself at odd angles, particularly when erect.<br>  Surgery to make the penis thicker involves suctioning fat from a fleshy part of the body and injecting the fat into the penis. Another technique is simply to graft fat cut away from the buttocks or abdomen onto the penile shaft. Some practitioners use tissue from cadavers.<br>  None of these techniques have been shown to be safe or effective. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons describes injecting fat into the penis as "a new and unproven cosmetic procedure of unknown safety" with potential risks that include infection, skin or sensory loss, excessive bleeding and loss of function.<br>  Surgeons have developed another technique — albugineal surgery with bilateral saphenous grafts — that involves grafting blood vessels from elsewhere in the body to the penis in order to increase blood flow and penis width during erection. An Italian study of 39 men who underwent the surgery for cosmetic reasons found that it increased width by an average of one-half inch without complications. These men may have been lucky.<br>  Following various types of cosmetic penile enhancement surgery, some men have had to undergo additional operations to correct deformities caused by the original procedure. The ill effects include scarring, shorter penises, hair on the base of the penis, low-hanging penis, loss of sensitivity, and bumps, lumps, and clumps of fat. Other complaints include impotence, urinary incontinence and persistent pain.<br>  Then there's the cost: about $10,000 for a typical penis-enlargement surgery that doesn't require additional corrective surgery. Because cosmetic surgery is seldom covered by insurance, you'll likely have to bear the entire expense.<br>   <br>  MORE ON THIS TOPIC<br>  ·Cosmetic surgery: What to know beforehand<br>   <br>  When surgery may be an option<br>  Surgeons have devised reconstructive procedures for penises that have been amputated or damaged by circumcisions, animal bites, motor vehicle accidents and physical assaults, among other causes. A penis can be constructed in sex-change operations and to correct birth defects.<br>  And this might work: Achieve a healthy body weight<br>  One place that size might count is your abdomen — not your penis. If your lower abdomen hangs over your genitalia, you might look as if you have a shorter, smaller penis than you actually do. Fat can obscure some or much of the upper part of the penis. For this, the best treatment is to achieve a healthy weight.<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/penis/MC00026" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/penis/M...</a>|`|AA11870386	try this. get good and hard, reach under the testis to the place between them and the anus.

a441e568f222c79b8a537d576bb7c86baa	I know how you feel I'm now 19 and i come from a family who suffers from eating disorders. It's not easy. No one understands unless they have had one. You have to ease yourself into a healthy diet you know the foods that make you feel like you have eaten "light" and the foods that make you feel "heavy" avoid the heavy foods for now (so you don't vomit) and keep a journal of the food you eat and the calories you take in. It's up to YOU to build up to 1200 or 1500 calories you can't just take that in all in one day. its too much. work up to it. it took me 3 years to over come my disorder. you can do it too. Good luck and don't listen to some of these other people that don't understand. :)|`|AA10208217	The last I read it was1500 per day. I use to be heavy but I lost weight and it was by starving myself it was because of how much I ate 1 meal a day between the hours of 12 and 6pm 8 glasses of water a day and I went from238 to 145 in 3 months and that was 14 years ago not to mention the fact that I have 5 teenage children  also so think about that|`|a63afa6b0aa87195631ab45070a5d440aa	Sounds like your weight issue is really all in your head. You need to work on that first, before starting a diet of any kind. I suggest buying a book about anorexia and reading it.<br>  <br>  As you said, it's not healthy. You may look the way you want, but youre not really happy with yourself.<br>  Anorexia doesnt just eat away at your muscles, it does a number of things to bone mass, hormones, skin problems, and your immune system.<br>  <br>  After youve done the right thing and consulted your doctor, and educated yourself about anorexia and bolemia. Then it time for your diet. Proteins are very important to your growth and the growth of your cells, as are many vitamins and minerals. Meats that arent high in fat and cholestorol, like turkey and other processed meats would be great to consume and digest.<br>  <br>  Youre 16. You are not finished growing yet. Starting a healthy diet not, will grow you into the beatiful woman that you expect to be.|`|d543708f5193cde6fc5fe5d6228a2145aa	doctors reccomend 2000 calories|`|17ec294cde4b4414a19eb9bb77ba2512aa	Ok first "throwing up" is not a natural process to use calories.  You have pro bally have little or no fat at that height and weight.<br>  And muscle is not fat.  Don't mistake one for the other.  I think a weight of 116 lbs would be healthy and sexy for a height of 5'6".<br>  how to get to that weight?  First don't "throw up" if you are feeling guilty about eating to much do something like exercise that is a natural process of calorie use.   <br>  Here is an activity calculator for calories. <a href="http://www.rd.com/tools/ActivityCalorieCalculator.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rd.com/tools/ActivityCalorieC...</a><br>  A persons weight can fluctuate almost 5 lbs daily so you just want to keep it in a comfortable range.  you might weigh 115 lbs one morning and that evening weigh 118 lbs but it is nothing to worry about cause the next morning you will be weighing 115 lbs with out doing anything but going to the bathroom.  So you do not need to throw up!<br>  <br>  How much calories in take you need depends on your activity.To gain weight you just need to intake more than you put out if you are going to gain weight.  I think you need 3500 calories = 1 lbs<br>  So if you are going to watch you calorie input and want to gain a pound a week I would add 500 calories a day to what you put out.   What is 500 calories- a big protein shake or protein bar.<br>  <br>  People with this condition usually imagine that they are fat, so you need a REAL system to calculate the state of your health.<br>  See a doctor<br>  good luck,  and remember  muscle is not fat.|`|1a94c33485a1f843c488943d171c11ffaa	You need to gain anywhere from 20 to 40 pounds, depending on your body structure, to be at a healthy weight. I know I need to eat about 1500 calories a day to lose enough weight to get back to a healthy size for me. I am the same height but overweight. I would guess that you need to eat 1600-1800 calories a day to get back to a good weight for you. Look in to whether there are any local support groups for people with anorexia and bulimia near you. As a fat person I can tell you, there are worse things in life! Dr Phil had two women with anorexia on his show the other day. Look on his website to see if there are any helpful ideas.

I would recommend you take calcium supplement but make sure it comes with magnesium in the ratio of more than 2:1. (Calcium 2 and magnesium 1). Calcium is needed for proper muscle function, thus it will help reduce the pain. On top of that, calcium is lost drastically due period, so it is advisable to supplement during period. 600mg to 1000mg would be fine.

e0a68484780e49fc1c353ad71bddecf9aa	Masturbating is not bad for you at all! It relieves stress, and is very pleasureful as you probably already know ;)<br>  <br>  Its perfectly normal. There's nothing with with pleasure!<br>  <br>  But downside is that you can get addicted (when masturbating gets in the way of ur life like homework, family time, friend time, blah blah blah! you get me??)<br>  <br>  So mostly everyone does it. Don't feel ashamed in  anyway. You might want to check out www.jackinworld.com for some masturbation tips! LOL!<br>  <br>  Have fun. That's what its all about! If your worried about ejaculating (the white stuff that comes out), then thats nothing to be worried about. Its not bad for your health because your body makes it on the daily basis. It has to get out somehow (through wet dreams, MASTURBATION, or other natural ways), and as soon as you ejaculate, your body begins making more 'sperm', so theres nothing bad!!!!<br>  <br>  Just  alittle background info for you.|`|6f357245e095f08b8c995cbe0074506caa	Yes IT IS! Many doctors and people out there are taught by these "medical schools" or "medical experts" that masturbation has no harmful effects. But that's NOT ENTIRELY TRUE. Masturbation, especially if it is done too frequently, can hurt your prostate, weaken your kidney, and the to put it in the Chinese way, reduce your "qi" i.e. your central energy. Your semen contains so much precious nutrients and it's like the essence of your body. Think about it, when you masturbate you are just letting it out and throwing it away! Unless you properly re-charge yourself with food/nutrients and other fitness exercises after masturbation, masturbation can indeed weaken your body!|`|7c14976adc2cb24cbd0b393be7725b09aa	just bad for your social life|`|b954695511b09906faf0bbd09c3e99fcaa	Nope...just as long as it doesn't interfere with school, work, etc.|`|fe8a853f925097d816491329187b043daa	i dont think i t is\<br>  chek out the link<br>  :)Is Masturbation Harmful? <br>  <br>  In general, the medical community considers masturbation to be a natural and harmless expression of sexuality for both men and women. It does not cause any physical injury or harm to the body, and can be performed in moderation throughout a person's lifetime as a part of normal sexual behavior. Some cultures and religions oppose the use of masturbation or even label it as sinful. This can lead to guilt or shame about the behavior. <br>  <br>  Some experts suggest that masturbation can actually improve sexual health and relationships. By exploring your own body through masturbation, you can determine what is erotically pleasing to you and can share this with your partner. Some partners use mutual masturbation to discover techniques for a more satisfying sexual relationship and to add to their mutual intimacy.
c049f1485f4ce05a0ed58c1cab637052aa	I get white spots on my fingernails ALL THE TIME. It's usually from not eating enough Zinc in your diet. Other times it's because white spots sometimes form from pressure being put on your nails like if you hit your nail with a hammer for example. I don't really know how to get rid of them, I just cover them with nail polish.|`|a6b6bc07f4a3a67a1a024a2c5f9a6314aa	Those little white dents in finger and toe nails are from blows of some sort, a stub or a drawer closing on it. The nail separates a bit and that is a tiny pocket of air. You can actually follow it up as it grows.... I have a split nail, too, it is also from a blow of some sort. The nail bed was damaged, and I have a tiny ridge and then the top splits. But the problem is actually is just above the cuticle. I have never figured it was serious enough to go to a doctor about. The white marks just grow out.|`|2e403b15a2aed67a48d22ce4db4315e8aa	fungus? tinea pedis?|`|11a584a83175e75702a9de3089296632aa	it can be a fungus or it can be pressure under the nail. there is a liquid that you can put on it, but it barely works and costs quite a bit. the best thing to do is keep cutting your nails regularly and it will grow out with your nail.

a5ffae0c2b63374e414522d9848cb8d8aa	You have a low womb--All the doctor needs to do is put in a pedestal (which doesn't hurt). It is not an elective surgery just to have your womb removed.  It has to be a life endangering thing, one that is generally a medical thing which you have nothing to do with other than having the condition. What you can do is love your child with all your heart & soul and keep trying to have a baby and maybe nothing will come of it or maybe something will.|`|2bc7ef38bb1cece44aae03510a2d045aaa	Dr's won't do it unless its a life threating situation.  The fact that you have just one child doesn't mean anything.  You could ask to get your tubes tied, it might be a fight but find a dr that will do it. But for the most part, You probably will not find a dr take everything out.  If they would do it by you asking for it, I would of had it out after my 3rd pregnancy. By the way, my womb is tilted.  So we all have our abnormaities.|`|AA10744296	Why would you even consider such a drastic medical procedure?  Clearly your "low womb" didn't inhibit you from conceiving, carrrying, and delivering your three year old child.  Are you considering this because you don't want another child?  There are pretty sure methods of birth control (no method is 100% certain), but a partial hysterectomy is a serious operation.<br>  <br>  You have the final decision to make, but I'd certainly talk with a partner and your gynocologist.

Perhaps only after you are done reading a magazine put it in the bathroom or reserve a magazine for being read in the toilet.|`|6cc0ef9c129d778515f998ecf2e9261daa	I think it's gross.

Im sure she didnt wipe with it or something bizzare.|`|edc74ff2668b10a9456c58b4cb926e78aa	Hahahaha some people even put magazine racks in the bathroom...I think it's a bit rude if she actually went to your room and got it...I can't believe she used the restroom in your house|`|2ba84d0e3508fd99d9dfc2cfaccb08e1aa	Definitely rude and not hygienic.|`|ea0d0d10d15da75541e707fcb0f66b80aa	well maybe she found ur magazine worthwhile to read . there are persons who are reading in toilet while pooing.. ha ha ha, she might not have enough magz at home.

AA11958876	The reason genital warts are so common is because most people never develop symptoms so they never realize they have the disease.  You can still spread it even though you don′t have any visible warts.<br>  <br>  It is rare but still possible to get warts in your mouth from having oral sex with someone who has had them.<br>  <br>  Genital warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV).

e28ac66da2831a433124718393f7e70eaa	Society sends women mixed messages about their looks and weight. I am 5'4 120 lbs and have days where i feel like the fattest person on the earth. We get confused about what our perfect weight is and alot of us even see ourselves as bigger than we really are. In Hollywood 5'4 and 120 lbs would probably be considered overweight and that is always what we are seeing. Most of us who are within a reasonable healthy weight know that we are not obese but we still never feel quite thin enough. i would love to drop down to about 105-110 lbs, but i know that i could not do that without starving myself and being very unhealthy.|`|72472e0880c82c1acad2e9acb56bbfefaa	I always wonder too.|`|fec661c36109a7d91d33aab0c54b0b24aa	Guys ask the same questions too, it just may not be related to weight.

bf1024b1f5157eaf225de76b644af03caa	Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost of Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery in India. One of the most frequently asked questions when considering Removal of Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery is "how much?" and “what is the price of surgery in India?”<br>  <br>  Oftentimes, patients choose their surgeon on the basis of price. <br>  The cost of Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery is very affordable in India and costs are much lower when compared to the United States, UK and other countries. However, since the success of your surgery is largely dependent on your choice of surgeon, cost should not be your main consideration for your decision to undergo Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery in India.<br>  <br>  I checked out the website of Forerunners Healthcare –which is the premier most medical tourism company in India offering low cost surgery in India to International Patients. They have served more than 400 International patients from across the globe (specially US and UK) to get low cost affordable surgery in India at the best Hospitals and Medical Institutions. And the general price of the Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery is as follows-<br>  <br>  The Cost of Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery in India is $ 270.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  <br>  In India, any licensed medical doctor can perform Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery. To avoid unsatisfactory results, it is best to choose a surgeon who has completed an accredited residency-training program in Treatment of Port-wine Stains/Birthmarks surgery. He should have extensive experience in the procedure you will undergo. That’s when Forerunners Healthcare come into picture-helping you get the best surgeon for your surgery at the most affordable prices in the best Hospitals of India.<br>  <br>  Your surgeon's skill can make all the difference between a good and an average result. Thus, although it is understandable that price is one of the considerations in your choice of surgeon, it is important to remember that the main consideration should be your surgeon's professional qualifications and experience.<br>  <br>  Besides that you should look into other issues related to traveling abroad, which is your visa, passport, climate, cultural issues and language barrier. Although language is not a problem in India –as most of the people are well verse in English. But you should make sure that you have a reliable hand holding person to guide you through the various steps of getting medical treatment and surgery in India.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|17796069ac9db13e8face6f2e53ad8e2aa	contact your local dermatologist for consult! maybe 2 or 3 to see what the charges are.

It actually was so prevalent in a gradeschool in our state the whole school shut down.  It's very contagious, and from the sounds of it very miserable.  Here's the article :<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   --- An unusually active norovirus season has schools, day cares and nursing homes on high alert.<br>  <br>  While facilities struggle to contain the virus, the Black Hawk County Health Department struggles to track it because the virus acts quickly, and facilities are reluctant to report cases.<br>  <br>  Black Hawk County Health Department officials said outbreaks with symptoms similar to norovirus, commonly and incorrectly referred to as the "stomach flu," have hit at least four area elderly housing communities and a Manchester elementary school in the last month.<br>  <br>  Enough facilities have experienced isolated cases that those without them are the exception, said Ann Rogers, community health program manager for the health department. <br>   <br>  Norovirus symptoms don't last long and victims usually recover completely with no long-term health effects. The most common cause of hospitalization is dehydration.<br>  <br>  Yet the intensity of the virus' nasty symptoms --- nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and low-grade fever --- and its highly contagious nature make it difficult to contain and manage.<br>  <br>  Norovirus can spread, like influenza, through any infected surfaces, especially hand-to-hand contact. More than half the outbreaks originated from contaminated food, so the health department strongly urges food preparers to stay home until symptom-free for a few days.<br>  <br>  Unlike influenza, norovirus can't be spread through coughing or sneezing. The most common way it becomes airborne is through vomiting, said Mark Linda, environmental health manager for the health department.<br>  <br>  "You can aspirate the virus through vomiting," he said. "You can almost envision clouds of the virus coming off the vomit."<br>  <br>  Once airborne, the virus becomes more contagious. In the case of the senior care facility that called the department last week, a man vomited in the dining room and the next day 12 people became sick, Rogers said. That prompted her to send out an e-mail to all health care facilities outlining precautions to prevent the disease's spread. Rogers said she couldn't divulge the facility's name due to privacy restrictions.<br>  <br>  More than one senior care facility has shut down its dining room and isolated the sick, she said, which is standard procedure whenever a contagious disease hits a nursing home.<br>  <br>  Yet there are few confirmed cases of the disease because the virus comes and goes quickly --- in 24 to 48 hours --- and because facilities are reluctant to report them.<br>  <br>  "It's so pervasive in the community that we don't do investigations, only phone consultations. There are so many, and they're nearly over by the time we hear of it," Linda said.<br>  <br>  Out of eight calls to senior care facilities in the area, only two acknowledged to having the virus this fall, and none said they experienced an outbreak. Linda said he faces similar obstacles when trying to track the virus. He said he receives reports from clients of a facility or from testing laboratories more often than from the facilities themselves.<br>  <br>  "Sometimes we hear about these from alternative means; eventually we ring it out of them," he said.<br>  <br>  Julie Christianson, a nurse at Rosewood Estates in Waterloo, said their kitchen was closed and people were isolated to their rooms for a couple days when the virus hit their facility a few weeks ago.<br>  <br>  At Friendship Village, the virus has so far appeared only in isolated cases, said Sharon Holdiman, director of nursing. She said they're taking the usual precautions to prevent disease spread: They isolate the sick, send sick workers home, only allow healthy visitors in and wash hands and use hand sanitizer frequently.<br>  <br>  "We haven't had the extensive effects of the virus this year. We've had it happen in the past, but so far nothing this year," she said.
09ba449ec43776e2f630b8080da82af4aa	Five months is completely normal. If you feel stressed or anxious about this, then see a doctor you trust for reassurance.<br>  <br>  Periods settle down for the vast majority of women after about 1-3 years. Even if you don't settle down into a regular rhythm, that still can be normal for you. If after three years you are still unpredictable with no regular cycle, I would then see a doctor. Even at that stage, there will probably be nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  Various activities in life can affect your period, such as vigorous sporting or atheletic activities, and stress.<br>  <br>  To give you my story, I started by period at the age of 14 and it was NEVER predictable or normal. I went on the pill at 18, simply because after 4 years, I still did not have a regular pattern. When I was 22, I stopped having periods for 9 months, yet there was no possibility of pregnancy. After a series of tests, it was finally determined that this was normal for me. I am now 30, and my period is still only regulated by taking the pill. While this is not 'normal' in the big scale of things, it is normal for me.|`|09f6c3dd9449bd0cd1f441c3484d8fc4aa	yes it could be. its kinda common. but, if ur still nervouse u can talk 2 ur doc if  u want|`|AA11563286	when you first start your period, it is irregular|`|AA11825857	yes it is because like everything your body has to get used to all of the changes your body is going through.|`|2fedeed8ca4f693a7d911f2cc8e09e9baa	it is perfectly normal! when i got mine for the first time i think it was like 5 or 6 months before i got another one! it takes i think about a year to get your body in the swing of things!|`|9823a096acd2b36fc5e92feff74f16c4aa	Your body will follow it's own clock for your whole life, unless you are on the pill.

ba5d13275d3bede150f71e0624620936aa	I am not a doctor, nor a female. My (late) wife at heart, had endometriosis as well as polycystic ovaries. She had a number of surgeries to burn the endometrial tissue ( I think these are called ablations). From a surgeon's opinion in Australia in the early 90's she had the worst case of endo he had seen. It started when she was 12.<br>  She was told she would never be capable of having children, and we managed to get pregnant twice (we aborted early twice, both times were a surprise and we were not ready for a child).<br>  <br>  <br>  She was covered in hives after swimming at the local beach, and had an ablation scheduled. She was concerned about this, but they insisted on continuing with the operation (which she did). She got septicemia that almost killed her. The swore that surgery was not worth the risk in her mind, and she saw a more radical gynecologist.<br>  <br>  The gyn asked her what her greatest fear was when hit with an attack. She said she got scared while doubled over in pain on the ground and onlookers helpless and clueless to provide any relief, as well as paramedics. Back then endo was not well known (it was put down to period pain until she was 23 from countless doctors). She got a note from the gyn advising to give her a shot of pethidine when she was in severe pain, with his mobile number to ring to confirm it.<br>  <br>  She was referred to a psychologist who was experimenting with pain management as a technique for endo sufferers, and when she went through her past, she discovered she had been subjected to psychological abuse from her family, and she had a a lot of things bothering her, and her stress levels were at the brink of insane, and she did 6 months psychotherapy to resolve her past as best as she could.<br>  <br>  This was just before she met me and she got short milder pain for the first year, and was pain free for 7 years, and she ended up passing away from a brain tumor (like her adoptive grandmother, weird coincidence).<br>  <br>  It would be ridiculous to say this is a cure that will fix anyone, and insulting to say that endo is all in the mind. But it would not be unreasonable to think perhaps that a stressed mind manifests in a physical form (like what was thought to have been the case with ulcers). I do believe it is in every endo sufferer's interest to at least look into this route as it is the least invasive path and definitely before a hysterectomy is considered.<br>  <br>  She was the editor of the association's newsletter which she gathered information from the internet about endometriosis, and she attended some surgeries, and she was of the opinion that the tiny amount of endometrial tissue they ablate could not cause that much pain. That would lead me to believe their could be some neurological or psychological component to this.<br>  <br>  The ethics in the providers of care for this illness must be questioned. This could be an unusual condition that does not have a pharmaceutical nor surgical cure, and the volume of money pushed in this direction is huge.<br>  <br>  There are people that get only temporary relief from both hysterectomies, and it is an extremely drastic procedure. The same thing with getting pregnant. Although old drugs, synarel and depo provera gave her some brief relief (although with synarel the doc she saw prescribed a double dose for 3 months by mistake.)<br>  <br>  Anyway some food for thought<br>  <br>  Wish you well|`|AA12341414	I started getting periods when I was 10, but the endometrioses didn't start until I was about 14. It was so bad that it had me hospitalized several times. Strangely the tests showed that my case was only minor and that birth control would ease the pain. So they put me on birth control when I was about 19, and it worked magic. Oh, and I'm 24. Good luck.|`|AA11229176	Endometriosis can get progressively worse as a woman gets older if it is not treated early on.  Nearly 70% of those with Endometriosis (at all stages) report having symptoms as a teen that went unaddressed.

Good luck and feel better.|`|AA11544462	I started my periods at about 11 or 12 and have always had a bad time with them so I'm not sure exactly when my endo developed.  I was an adult (late 20's) when it got to it's worst point.  My doctor did a laproscopy and laser and that helped tremendously.  I've also been on the pill at times, which also helped and had a 6 month shot series that put me into a temporary menopause.  I didn't have a period for about 10 months (which was heaven!!) and that also helped.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to talk to your doctor about your treatment options and/or pain management.  Good luck!|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	I started getting the pain of endo when I was 21. I wasn't officially diagnosed until I was 27 though. I am 29 now. The pain started getting unbearable after a few years. Most of my Ob-Gyns just dismissed my pain. I finally found a doctor that listens to me. He has not however found anything to help eleviate the pain. The only way that I cope with it is to take a few days off work during the worst days. My doctor gave me some literature to give to my boss to explain my absence so that has been very helpful. <br>  <br>  I plan on eleviating my pain completely within a few years. I plan on having my ovaries removed after I have my baby. If that doesn't eleviate the pain then I will have everything else removed.

ce055af39c4a40fd9da877ba474bfe17aa	My first thought is that the doctor's office probably should have already told you what to bring and/or what to expect. And you certainly should feel comfortable asking them...realistic expectations and good communication with your doctor are some factors that help make plastic surgery successful. So form your good habits now and call them back to ask! Plus every doctor probably does their consultation a little differently, so you should check with them directly to see what all you need to bring.<br>  <br>  So...that being said, I'm sending along a helpful link to questions you can ask during the consultation. I think they'll help you feel prepared and confident for the appointment...but just remember to communicate with the doctor and her staff. This is your time, your chin :), your money...ask lots of questions, share your concerns, etc. Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.plasticsurgeryportal.com/ask.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasticsurgeryportal.com/ask....</a>|`|TV7Q7hmBaa	That $125. is just a drop in the bucket, if you are serious, have a large bank account as these operations cost a lot of money.  You won't need to bring pictures, as what you think you might want, may not be right for you.  The doctor will take pictures if you want to but will use a computer to show you several all around views.  Most people just look at themselves from one angle, and don't consider the overall effect.  Take your time as once it is done, it is done.     Best wishes.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Pictures would help, but know that every plastic surgeon is differnt.

But pictures should help the doc get ideas what you want. She should also tell you the down time what the procedure is, what to expect, the cost, what not to eat or take before hand. Some doctors can give you a computer image. Make sure that if the surgery doesn't come out right they will fix it free including the hospital room.

I am 16, and everytime I do situps, I can feel my abs right away. My advice for you is to not drink soda, cut off on the salt (because it causes your belly to be bloated), run/walk whenever you have the chance, and drink lots of water. Most importantly, whenever you're bored or when you wake up, do situps for at least 15 minutes. This is what I do and even my 9 year old brother has a six pack because we always do sit-up challenges. It's simple and you don't need to listen to all the nonsense about going on a diet. I eat all i want, when I want and I still have abs. Again, since you're skinny your six pack will come quick.

AA10478980	No, you can't lose belly weight only by doing ab exercises.  The exercises will certainly strengthen the abs muscles, but to lose the fat that is on top of the muscles you have to lose weight overall.  There is no such thing as "spot reduction".  The only way to do that would be through something drastic such as liposuction.|`|d9a04c051e1e198cb7dbbadc062c3ce8aa	Yes but your overall look will suck.

Your body then burns its excess fat and you begin to lose it, but you lose it in a predetermined order that has nothing to do with your specific exercise program, or anything that you do for that matter.<br>  <br>  When your caloric intake is greater than your burn, you put on fat, and I'm sure that you've noticed that certain areas of your body seem to put on fat before others.  When your caloric output is greater than your intake, you begin to lose fat --- and you'll lose it in areas according to what your metabolism dictates, usually in reverse order; that is, the last place that you put it on is the first place that will reduce and the first place that you put it on will be the hardest place to get fit, and it doesn't matter, in terms of reducing fat, what area of the body you are specifically exercising.<br>  <br>  The exercise itself does two things.  It strengthens and enlarges the muscles in the specific area and increases your caloric burn.  By increasing your caloric burn you will lose fat, BUT in your metabolism's predetermined order, not according to your wishes.  So, you can strengthen the ab muscles by exercising them, but you won't lose any more fat in that area by doing the ab exercises than if you did, for example, pushups.  And remember, even if you're exercising, you'll still put on fat if you're eating more than you're burning.  So, you can have strong abs that are covered by a layer of fat. <br>  <br>  That's why folks do cardio, because cardio not only strengthens the heart muscle but it provides you with your highest caloric burn.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind too that muscle weighs more than fat, so as you replace fat with muscle you will actually gain weight, but it is good weight; also, muscle burns fat, so that increase in muscle mass will provide you with more calorie burn naturally, even while you're resting. <br>  <br>  The best program that you can adopt is one that includes cardio  and some type of overall strengthening program for your muscles and bones.  Strengthening the muscles and bones is particularly important as you get older.<br>  <br>  This will no doubt be more of a time investment than you were hoping for, but it is time well spent and you'll feel the difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|b4892303788f58a932df141d0ada67ecaa	wouldn'te we all love to get rid of the belly pouch :)  unfortunately, you can't "spot reduce" one area of your body.  to really burn the fat around your belly, focus on your overall cardio training and really watch your diet...get rid of the refined sugars, caffeine, salt, and excess fat intake (you do need *some*fat) and try increasing your water intake to make sure you're getting 8-10 glasses a day.  it's tough to do, but totally possible.  good luck with your fitness goal!|`|e07ff7e1d72e7a3484e31984cc582fa5aa	No dancing and swimming are other great ways to lose that belly fat, also eating plenty protein and fiber.. as well as drinking water there are situps that you can do, but put your feet as close to your butt as you can and then do a sit up this helps alot better as it then makes you have to uses your abs more better and also is not so hard to do a sit up if you do it that way I have learned that now and have lost 7 pds.. in a week by doing that and its in my belly legs and arms....|`|ff2269a2bd5d7e9e24e4faa811238c43aa	It isn't the most efficient way because you have to do cardio to get rid of the fat so the newly toned muscles will be visible.
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Mine came back only six weeks after my lap. I have an agressive case of endo. My doc told me the only way to eliminate the pain is to have a hysterectomy. But I have heard of some women who still have pain after having everything removed.|`|83015444866943370bf520ad05f72476aa	I'm not sure how long it takes for it to grow back.  I was diagnosed with it 6 years ago, right after I turned 16.  I still experience severe pain, and they can't tell me anything without surgery again, but I swear it is back, and that took almost five years.  I would just stay away from ANY Depo shot on the market.  Speaking from experience, I gained thirty pounds in one year on the shot, and I was dancing, playing tennis, going to school, and working a part time job.  It's not worth it.  There is no sure-fire way to get rid of the endometriosis though, but I have heard that pregnancy is a good way to put it into remission.  But the only way that I would suggest that is if you are in a monogamous relationship and married, or planning on marriage, and if you are old enough and stable enough personally and financially to handle something as severe as that.|`|8f156af91501ebc3853d600a2c5c521eaa	It could be months to years - there are medicines that you can take (including the Mirena IUD) that can help to prevent endometriosis from returning - none of them are 100% though.|`|AA10818277	It depends on your hormone levels and own body as to how fast it comes back.

I chose Lupron treatment, it's a shot every 3 months that cuts hormones which cuts off the growth of all the junk. It does put you in menopause tho, rumor has it that Mayan abdominal massage is supposed to help problems too but I have not seen any clinical trials or authentic information on that.|`|79b925086d95f7b70d82315a1020d91aaa	I know women who are seeing great results - their endo even disappearing - by using natural progesterone cream.

There are various underlying causes, such as diabetes, many of which are medically reversible.<br>  <br>  The causes of erectile dysfunction may be physiological or psychological. Psychological impotence can often be helped by almost anything that the patient believes in; there is a very strong placebo effect.<br>  <br>  A useful and simple way to distinguish between physiological and psychological impotence is to determine whether the patient ever has an erection. If never, the problem is likely to be physiological; if sometimes (however rarely), it is more likely to be psychological. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental diseases (DSM-IV) has included a listing for impotence.<br>  <br>  <br>  A wide variety of options exist for treating erectile dysfunction. They include everything from medications and simple mechanical devices to surgery and psychological counseling. The cause and severity of your condition are important factors in determining the best treatment or combination of treatments for you. You and your doctor may also want to consider how much money you're willing to spend and the personal preferences of you and your partner. If erectile dysfunction is the result of a medical condition, the cost of treatment may be covered by insurance.<br>  <br>  The prescription PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis) are prescription drugs which are taken orally. They work by blocking the action of PDE5, which causes cGMP to degrade. cGMP causes the smooth muscle of the arteries in the penis to relax, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood.<br>  <br>  Viagra, Levitra and Cialis work in much the same way. Chemically known as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, these drugs enhance the effects of nitric oxide, a chemical messenger that relaxes smooth muscles in the penis. This increases the amount of blood and allows a natural sequence to occur — an erection in response to sexual stimulation. These medications don't automatically produce an erection. Instead they allow an erection to occur after physical and psychological stimulation. Many men experience improvement in erectile function after taking these medications regardless of the cause of their impotence.<br>  <br>  You can try Viagra, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Viagra in 1998, and it became the first oral medication for erectile dysfunction on the market. Since then, doctors have written millions of prescriptions for the blue, diamond-shaped tablets. But Viagra is no longer the only pill that treats this condition. Levitra and Cialis are two other options. You can find this drugs from online pharmacy.<br>  Read more here:|`|71b6fa19f5a4e43453bbb421e084f4bdaa	go to Ayurhelp.com & Ayurvediccure.com - Learn about Indian Ayurvedic remedies for your problem.  buy online direct from India & see some improvement.   always go with Ayurvedic medicine - not chemical drugs from any MD<br>  <br>  Viagra is garbage & not a magic wand.|`|f61d7b55c7a8f82e1a344628134f4f1eaa	It may well be a medical problem for which you need to be examined by your doctor. There are a number of ailments of the male genitals that can cause erections to not come up or not stay up.<br>  <br>  However, if your doctor pronounces you healthy and says your equipment is in good working order, then you need to deal with other factors that cause this type of failure to function. the big ones are:<br>  a) stress caused by work, life, family, etc. If your mind is all tied up wrestling with all the cares and worries of life or a situation or a problem, then your mind is takign you away from enjoying sex and probably many of the other pleasures that make life itself so wonderful. Review, with yrou wife if possible, all the aspects of yoru work life, home life, family life, etc. and try to identify problem areas or worries or other cases where stress is gettign into your head. then sort them out and deal with them effectively.<br>  <br>  b) the other significant aspect to erection failure I notice is what can only be termed boredom. No, it isn;t that you need a new partner, more that many years of the same sex in the same place with the same person can just become routine and mundane and not sexcite you any longer. So, it is high time to mix it up a lot and retuirn to the carefree days of yoru youth when sex was spontaneous and was done anywhere anytime. No one says you have to hold fast forever to one technique in one place; you are free to do it and be creative. The laundry room, the litchen, the living room are all safe places. The back seat of the car or the back deck or even the local park are both more adventurous and more thrilling. And buy a book on the 50 ways to pleasure each other and study it carefull and practice them all so you find all sorts of ways to rejuvenate the sexual side of yoru relationship. And let's not forget flowers, dating, goign to the y or swimming together, walking in a park holding hands and kissing and all those simple pleasures you may have long ago abandoned. Set yoruselves free and enjoy.

Just don't pay attention to the scale, pay attention to how you feel and don't forget to exercise 30 mins a day and eat right-lots of fruits and veggies, less meat, limited junk food.  just find an exercise that you like to do and focus on that and having fun rather than your weight.  your bmi (body mass index) is a perfect 21.6.  a healthy bmi is between 18.5-25 and anything below is underweight and above is overweight.  don't worry too much.  just have fun being a teen and learn how to eat well, exercise and feel good about yourself regardless of what you weigh.  also, pray to God and read your Bible.  check out the last two below sites for proper eating tips.|`|18a329f959e2681eeab55e2f2ac910baaa	you're fifteen. my sister went through that when she was fifteen too. since you put God in the subject, know that your body is a temple and it's not yours to abuse.

Know that you will have that body for the rest of your life and be content with it and be thankful that you're not fat. you're not fat and you're not nasty skinny. also know that tons of people strive to get to a balanced weight like you're but they never get it. if you do want to do something to make yourself feel better, walk and drink plenty of water. Moses didn't drive his SUV around the desert, he walked. walking works every part of the body and makes you feel good too. stressing yourself out about this isn't going to make it easier to lose weight. it only makes it harder. chill about it and whatever needs to fall off or get trimmed will. it's no overnight miracle, but it is a good choice for a lifetime.|`|AA10690207	Don't worry about it.

It will help to speed up your metabalism and your body will burn more calories in the process. And, it is not stored in the body as fat but it is  to converted to energy, which will help you to burn even more calories in return. It works for me, as I cook with it as well, and it is great for the hair and skin, also. Make sure that you get a brand that is totally natural and not processed. And, for your self-esteem, learn to meditate. I would recommend my mentor's flagship book called, "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind," by Dr. Joseph Murphy. Also, see the link below for more information on the health benefits of Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, from Dr. Mercola. (Also, read and study his information about the benefits of EFT, Emotional Freedom Technique, which is very good as well for improving one's self-esteem.) He also shows one how to learn to eat according to your "Metabolic Type," which is very useful as well. You can learn to feel good about yourself by empowering yourself with more knowlege and information about the importance of diet, nutrition, and excerise by doing some self study. And, this information will serve you well with good health and all for your entire life. The second link contains very good information on good health as well, from Dr. Hulda R.

It's not about how much you weigh, but how healthy you are (mentally and physically). Exercise is one way for you to take pride in yourself by taking care of your temple (your body) and it clears your mind. Begin keeping a daily journal, detailing the events of the day, your thoughts and feelings and something you're grateful for . After doing this for a while, you'll be able to look back and see your own growth and progress while seeing that list of things to be grateful for. You'll find that you're alot less stressed and may be less apt to focus on things you have no control over. You are fearfully and wonderfully and beautifully made. Appreciate the person that God made you to be and walk into your destiny with your head held high. Be encouraged and love yourself, so others will know how to love you (the way you want to be loved and treated). Best wishes sweetie.|`|AA10782876	The numbers don't matter and they never will.

Since there are many medications that have side effects with sudden withdrawal, you would do better to have your doctor help you get off the Paxil.  The doctor may have another that works better anyway.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I had no problem just stopping the Paxil but that may  not happen to everyone.  I have a friend that just weaned herself off by taking one every other day for a week , and then one every three days for a week, and one every four days for a week, and etc.  She did okay.  But again, your best option is to call your doctor and tell him/her that you want to be off Paxil and need help.  The one who prescribed it for you has the responsibility of helping you, so don['t worry about it, because they should be more than willing to assist you.  <br>  <br>  Best of success to you.  Paxil has been shown to be a good drug and maybe it has stopped working for you because your body could have developed an immunity to it, and now it is no longer effective.  <br>  Bottom line, don't do this alone, seek the help of the doctor who prescribed it.|`|1a94c33485a1f843c488943d171c11ffaa	Ask your doctor how you should decrease it to go off of it.

So, for example, if you take 20mg daily; I would take 20 mg daily for 1 week, then 10mg (1/2 tab) daily for a week or 2, and then either stop, or if side effects start to happen, take it every other day (at 10mg) for a week or two. Overall, I would taper over at least 2-4 weeks to prevent side effects from withdrawal of the medication. Hope this helps. Thanks.|`|8df0969ed36d6e26c9caeb3aaedc472baa	Do it very very slowly.

There are two popular theories: 1) It is hereditary or 2) Caused by being exposed to toxins over years and years.<br>  <br>  There is no cure for endo. So unfortunately there is no recovering from endo. If you have it, you have for your entire fertile lifetime. Surgery is the best way to relieve symptoms of endo. The surgeon can burn off the lesions to help eleviate some of the pain. Some women have found relief with certain hormones or pain medications. Others find relief through acupunture. Each women is different. The most definitive way to eleviate the pain is to have a total hystercomy. However this may not eleviate the pain for all women.|`|51a7d162644a1ff46ef541f153095ac1aa	Well, doctors are not really sure what causes it, but they do suspect that one cause could be that small pieces of the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus that  usually sheds during menstruation and is expelled from the vagina, loses it's way and actually backs up and is expelled through the fallopian tubes out into the body.  Where ever this tissue lands, it could implant there.  So during menstruation, this tissue acts just like the tissue inside your uterus and it sheds and bleeds and this is what causes the pain.  <br>  <br>  You doctor is the only one with the answers as to how to treat this.  It depends on you and your body.  Sometimes the pill can help.  Sometimes surgery is the best solution.  Make sure you stay ahead of the game and see your doctor on a regular basis. He may put you on mild analgesics for the pain.  <br>  <br>  My name is Vee.  I'm a registered nurse.  This is what I do  - give health advice and answers.

6fb91692ad9efab55b64e2cfb1453ba4aa	Is this sad a guy knows this? The G spot is an area of tissue approximately 1-3 inches inside the woman's vagina. It is located on the front of the vaginal wall. (If she is laying on her back just feel toward the ceiling.) In most women it feels like a spongy ribbed area usually about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Proper manipulation of this area (for that woman) usually produces extreme orgasms. It may take some trial and error to find its because exact location for each woman is different. But the results should be well worth it.|`|b0e380b7334a61860f262440508138cfaa	Hi,<br>   <br>  Woman can enjoy fore play maximum if you/she knows her G-Spots.By stimulating the G-spots she gets the maximum enjoyment. Which helps her to get Orgasm in intercourse.<br>  <br>  Following are the technique to stimulate her G-Spot<br>  After wetting your latex covered finger with saliva or water-based lubrication, slowly place two fingers into the vagina. Using your index finger, touch the anterior wall. It is approximately a finger length up. Many women like having the person touching them use their index finger to place some pressure on the wall. Try making the 'come here motion' with your index finger. Allow the tip of your finger to tap on the anterior vaginal wall. Let her level of excitement guide your movements. Talk with her, and ask her how different formsof touch feel. Some women may not like the feeling of being touched there and may even find it painful. Another way to tell if you are indeed touching her g-spot is that there will be a change in texture. The g-spot area will feel flushy, like a small area of wrinkled skin. In contrast, the surrounding area will feel taut. The shape of the g-spot is similar to an upright kidney bean.<br>  In addition to touching her g-spot with your index finger, I  encourage you to use your tongue (remember all those tongue exercises!) and stimulate her clitoris, inner & outer lips. The combination of fellatio (oral sex) with g-spot stimulation is enough to make most women become extremely excited<br>   <br>  Feel Free to contact for details<br>   <br>  Enjoy Life<br>   <br>  Dr.Mojo|`|e5d3d3f41b5affb5c3531f5379ce2802aa	The g-spot (Grafenberger spot) is located about 2 - 3 inches inside the vagina, on the vaginal wall toward the front of the body. If you are with a female partner, and are between her legs (with her on her back), insert your first two fingers into her vagina, and make a "come-here" motion. It will feel a little spongy compared to the rest of the vagina, and constant medium to hard pressure and stroking will feel the best.<br>  <br>  However, the G-sport can be tricky. It only exists if a woman is already aroused, so if you are having trouble finding it, go back to the kissing, petting, licking, sucking ,etc, and then go back and give it another go.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Essin' Em, www.hotmoviesforher.com
f96855d9bcf15beb40e2da2eb6ebb580aa	Pursuing an undergrad degree with an emphasis on science is the first step.  You can major in anything, but you have to have certain prerequisites to get into med school.  From there, you'll have 4 years of med school and then at least 4 years of residency, I think it's 8 or more for surgery.  If you're in high school or just starting college, I would suggest taking latin for your foreign language- it will help you in almost every class since many scientific terms are latin-rooted.  Also, good foundations in chemistry, biology, math, and anatomy/physiology will be helpful. Communications classes and writing classes will also help, as well as any class that helps you to develop study skills.  You should also try to shadow some doctors in that field and maybe even work for a doctor.  You'll need medical experience, volunteer experience, at least a 3.0, and a good MCAT score to get into med school. If you're in high school, it also looks good if you take some classes concurrently at your local college.  Talk to your high school or college counselor, and call a med school and tell them youre interested and want to take a tour/talk with med students.  They can tell you what it's like to be in med school, and give you more pointers.

One has to truly be committed to following that magic to lose weight.  And - if she's too lax to do any work to track food and exercise then she doesn't really want to lose weight. <br>  <br>  There are several good healthy programs. I'll mention two of them.<br>  <br>  WeightWatchers (or weightwatchers.com) and Self magazine both have healthy balanced programs.  The Self magazine one is free if the person has a subscription to Self.  That makes it less expensive than WeightWatchers.  WeightWatchers does not require counting calories and I found the online program easy to use.  One still tracks food intake - but that's the point.   <br>  <br>  Most programs encourage exercise - fun is different for different people. There are 100s of ways to be active.  Sports, transporting  herself by walking or bicycle, dancing, etc. <br>  <br>  If she's a healthy person, there's no reason this won't work. Often, it's all in our heads- excuses - lying to ourselves and others and not really wanting what we say we do.

7edb005fffc860fa080393ebd8da2e72aa	Apparaju, I had exactly the same problem when I was in school. It just happens for no reason and it takes a while to come out of that dreadful atmosphere. I was told to do regular yogic exercises and just take it as easy as passing clouds. But dude, its all easy to say. I just had to suffer whenever it hunted me down and guess what - scored poorly in my eleventh exams.  It just took me around 3-4 months to get everything settled and back to normal. Becasue the fear dies down as time passes by. And I dont get that now becuase my mind is matured enough to understand the silliness of the fear I had. <br>  <br>  But since you are working, you should be taking this a bit seriously. The way I tackled this was BY LIVING WITH IT. You have to adopt the policy that "only iron can cut iron".  If you are in a group and you just encountered with it, just have this attitude, "Oh man, you are back again, well lets go for a walk". This is what I did but dont expect any change happening overnight. It will be an extremely slow recovery and you wouldn't be able to measure its "size" each day as such.  <br>  <br>  Actually this also shows your attitude of pessimism. My personnel guess, thats it.

A rather conventional idea is jumping or skipping. Its relatively easy and doesnt consume much time. Skip/jump about an hour or two before food time. Start with about 50 or hundred before every meal (about thrice a day) and gradually increase it to about 300 or 400 over a week. Keep it up for about 6 months.I used to do 300 per session-900 jumps per day and added inches to my height. It really works if you r in ur growth spurt. Even otherwise its worth trying!

Además, es conveniente utilizar plantillas de carbono (a cambiar cada dos meses), que permiten que el pie respire, y deshacerse de zapatos que tengan algún tipo de mal olor. En el caso de que el calzado se moje, hay que limpiar y secar la piel de los zapatos, ya que en el tiempo produce mal olor. <br>  Los calcetines y medias deben estar hechos con tejidos o materiales naturales y utilizar, especialmente en invierno, la lana y el algodón. En verano funciona mejor el uso del lino, el hilo o la seda en el caso de medias, mientras que conviene evitar el nylon por tratarse de un material sintético poco tolerable, poco transpirable y productor de irritación. Se recomienda cambiar todos los días de calcetines o medias. <br>  Quienes practiquen algún deporte, deben poner especial énfasis en el cuidado de los pies y ser más escrupulosos con la limpieza posterior para conseguir que el pie esté seco. Asimismo, en el caso de utilizar posteriormente duchas o ba?os comunes hay que acceder a estos con zapatos tipo sandalias para evitar el contagio de hongos y bacterias, lo que da lugar al denominado pie de atleta. “Practicar deporte es sano, si se siguen las reglas adecuadas”, <br>  También hay que inspeccionar los pies cada día para descubrir posible enrojecimientos, manchas o cualquier presencia extra?a, y se debe acudir a la consulta del podólogo si, pese a seguir estos consejos, el mal olor continúa siendo fuerte.<br>  Saludos a tus pies!!!jajajajaaja|`|9b0d08ccfd9157d897078989b88a5799aa	ba?andose seguido|`|cdf7d25a2ba0fa5148b49f53237c2320aa	Hola....<br>  <br>  El mal olor f(junto con sudoración, picazon, sudoración y en ocaciones la piel rugosa y agrietada) forma parte de un cuadro caracteristico de una afección por hongos, una micosis local , que casisiempre afecta de igual manera a las u?as esto es llamado onicomicosis, así que para poder combatir el problema es necesario atacar el problema de base: LOS HONGOS<br>  <br>  Hay que usar fármacos aunado a la higiene personal adecuada, no dejar mojados los pies, ya que eso favorece la reproducción de los hongos, y seguir el tratamiento en un periodo prolongado. <br>  <br>  Es recomendable que lleves a cabo un tratamiento combinado oral y topico (en la piel).

Elimina todo lo blanco: No harinas, no azúcar, no papas, no arroz, etc.[Respecto al alcohol, acuérdate que el alcohol se metaboliza como azúcar, por tanto es blanco asi que hay que evitarlo]<br>  2. Toma sólo agua entre mas tomes mejor todos dicen que 8 vasos pero puedes tomar 10 y genial pues el agua elimina la sensación de hambre.<br>  3. No vayas al super con hambre pues compras todo lo que engorda<br>  4. Procura comer en tu casa o llévate tu comida en envases plásticos y prepárate una enorme ensalada, un consomé (funcionan genial esos de consomé concentrado en polvo, pues le pones 1 cucharadita a una taza de agua y ya tienes una rica sopa) acuérdate que lo caliente también quita la sensación de hambre.<br>  5. Puedes tomar todo lo que quieras de especias: pimienta, eneldo, canela, romero, en fin lo que se te ocurra, vinagre, vinagre balsámico, limón, eso si reduce tu consumo de aceite de oliva a una sola cucharadita.<br>  6. Abusa de los vegetales: por ejemplo prepárate una lasagna de calabacitas, sólo las rebanas a lo largo, les pones un poco de queso mozarella y salsa de spaguetti y tienes un platillo delicioso y muy satisfactorio sin que engorde nada. Puedes rebanar jícama y le pones limón y preparas una salsa de pico de gallo y eso se lo pones por encima y la comes como si fueran tostadas, en fin recetas con vegetales hay infinidad.<br>  7.Toma todos los días algo de proteinas: puedes tomar un bistec de 100 grs. o sea que mida el tama?o de la palma de tu mano, o bien le pones surimi a tu ensalada, o le pones atún (del que viene en agua).<br>  8. En cuanto a los lacteos únicamente toma un poco de queso de Oaxaca o mozarella a mi me gusta mucho hacerme unas gelatinas y tomarlas con una rebanada de queso como postre<br>  9. Fruta toma dos piezas al día pero olvídate de las muy dulces como el mango o el plátano..<br>  10. Algo que funciona sensacional es ir a comprar tantas bolsas de kilos de arroz o de frijol como kilos tengas demás y esas bolsas las colocas   junto al refrigerador incluso sobre la mesa donde comes y asi visualmente ves el sobrepeso que tienes, te juro que al verlas se espanta uno y te sorprendes de andar cargando tantos kilos de más y le da a uno mucho gusto ir retirando las que uno va perdiendo.<br>  11. Por último te diré que todo es cuestión de proponérselo, la fuerza de voluntad es indispensable, es tomar la decisión y todo se reduce a DDT = Dejar De Tragar.<br>  12.

AA12081817	I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.

e5e4d2337278402396d4216c0d898c9caa	First of all, it depends on what type of braces you are getting. For example, If you are getting braces on the top and the bottem as well as rubber bands, then it will hurt more than it would if you were only getting simple bottem races or simple top braces. However, here is what I have concluded about braces from personal experiance.<br>  <br>  Category 1: Getting your braces<br>  <br>  The day you get them put on: This day is actually the day when you are in pain the least until about day 8. Getting them put on itself doesn't hurt. Your lips may get a little chapped, so bring chapstick. Don't bother with the books or the magazines. Your entertainment will likely be a TV on the wall if you orth. has one, or you will be too concentrated on the fact that you are getting braces to care. Mine was a little of both. Anyways, the entire process only takes about 1.5-3.5 hours, depending again on the type of braces you get.<br>  <br>  After you get them put on, you will not be in much pain. Instead, you will be feeling a sort of numbness in your teeth. They will feel a bit soft, as if not strong enough to handle food. Prepare with lots of pudding, mashed potatoes, apple sauce, and Ice cream in case you get hungry.<br>  <br>  This day deceives you by making you think that braces aren't so bad. When you go to bed that night, brace yourself for day 1 after braces.<br>  <br>  Day 1: This day is the worst day of all. When you wake up in the morning, your teeth will seem a lot worse than the day before. Brush your teeth lightly, and then take some painkillers before going to school if you have to, even if your teeth aren't so bad yet. If you do not have school, wait until it starts to hurt to take them. I've found the best braces pain killers are Tylenol and Ibuprofen.<br>  <br>  The best word I can think of to describe day 1 is either sore or pain. I have a journal I kept when getting braces, and all that is written on this day is "my teethe hurt" or "owww" while the rest of the days have detailed descriptions. This pain still may not be as bad for you, remember, if you are not getting a full mouth with rubber bands like I did. Anyways, the best thing to do on this day (I've found) Is either very warm mushy foods or very cold mushy foods. (I.E.; Mashed potatoes or Ice cream) These soothe your teeth and give you a temproary bit of releif, especially if you like how they tase.<br>  <br>  Avoid even trying hard foods such as pretzels, or even like bread. You will find that you can not bite becuase of the "softness" feeling, and trying to do so will make it hurt more. Keep on taking painkillers throuhgout the day as directed on the container and as you need. Be sure to save one dose for when you go to sleep so you aren't lying awake becuase of sore teeth.<br>  <br>  Day 2: Day 2 is when it starts to get better. The good thing about day 2 is that you know it is all uphill from here. Your pain is only going to get better. (Well, at least until you get them tightened.)<br>  I would advise the same as day 1 with your foods. You may need less painkillers today, and your teeth might be starting to feel a little less sore. Still do not try to eat anything hard, though, becuase of what I warned about in day 1.<br>  <br>  Day 3: You've gotten your braces 4 days ago now, and it still doesn't seem much better. Continue following most of the advice given in day 1. Your soreness should be at least starting to going away. You could try to eat bread today, but still do not bite it. Take it with a fork and only chew at the very back of your mouth.<br>  <br>  Around this time an entirly new concept may be introduced: Wax. Your gums may be starting to become sore, and your orth. probably gave you wak to help this. Whenever using wax, be sure to remember that what is causing your gum pain is the connecting wires, not the brackets themselves. For some reason, the Brackets never hurt your gum, it is the wires that connect them, so be sure when you put it on, you always put it on the wire. Wax can get in some of your food, so when eating, try and take it out.<br>  <br>  Day 5: Better still! Try eating soft cereal today, but remember not to bite if you are not ready. You may also move on to fruits, hot vegetables, some salads, and soft meats. Be sure not to do this, however, if you are not ready.<br>  <br>  Day 6: You've nearly made it a week! By now, your teeth are probably feeling much better than day 1. You may not want to try pretzels or hard foods like that yet, but you are well on your way. Continue to use the advice given in the other days if you need it, and in no time you will sometimes forget that you even have braces at all and go back to normal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Category 2- other<br>  <br>  Tightening: This is not nearly as bad as getting them on. It is, however, similar in the way that it hurst worst the day after (Day 1) The familiar softness will be back, but don't worry, it doesn't take as long to go away. You'll be back to eating completely normal at around day 4 or 5. You may not have reached this level of eating until day 11 when getting braces. You may want to look back at day 1's advice if you are really hurting on tightening day 1.<br>  <br>  Chains: The color on your braces actually isn't your braces, it is rubber bands. Sometimes, you get what is called a chain, which is basically a rubber band that connects 2 or more teeth together. Chains can be as long as your entire mout, and as short as 2 teeth long. Chains hurt a little more, and generally put the process of getting to eat normal again back about a day.<br>  <br>  Braces damage/eating habits: I've broken a couple rubber bands here and there, and even lost a bracket once. My advice is to just leave it and notify your orth. about it when you go back to get your braces tightened if it is something small, like a rubber band breaking and falling off. If, however, something bigger like your bracket falling off happens, my advice is to call and tell them. They may want to see you earlier, becuase having it off for too long could prolonge the time you have brces and make your mouth hurt more when you have it replaced.<br>  <br>  About the rules: Don't completely follow them. You don't have to never eat a tootsie roll or pretzels again. You can even eat popcorn if you chew it thuroghly enough and clean your braces really well afterwords. My advice is to stay away from REALLY sticky things likr swedish fish, bubble gum, wax lips, and jelly beans. But if you go for however long you have braces without eating any of the prohibited stuff, you'll miss out on it when you could've eaten it and been just fine.<br>  <br>  Brushing: You may want to brush your teeth a little more with braces, becuase stains could be on your teeth after removal if you neglect them, which is very easy to do. You don't need any special toothbrush or paste for them. However, I would advise you to use the tool that they give you that looks kind of like a pipe cleaner to get whatever food is stuck between your teeth out before brushing. Your toothbrush can get pretty gross without this.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. As you can see, they do hurt, but following this will keep your pain to a minimum. If you have any questions, email me. I know a lot about braces. I had them for 2 1/2 years. If I would've had this when I was getting braces, I would have been incredibly happy. Good luck!<br>  <br>  A|`|84624c8d3b6020d05894daf0f5d711e7aa	It all depends on how tight they are.

The first time they hurt for about a week after they were put on and then every time they changed the wire.

You're mouth will hurt for a while, just take advil in the morning or when you have pain.  You're mouth will also get very full of saliva as it gets used to the new appliances.  Talking might also be hard, just take your time.

Take a pain reliever every 4 - 6 hours to alleviate the pain.  Remember to take something on your next visits when they tighten the wire.  Eat soft foods until your mouth feels better.  The pain will eventually pass.

AA12081817	I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.  <br>  <br>  A sight with some really cool diet calculators and interesting calorie counting calculators is here.

If you have been at the same weight for 2 weeks, try INCREASING your intake some. Your metabolism has started to store food, fearing starvation, and feeding yourself more will signal your body to release the stored "fat".|`|c8d65715721935979d637c4d08386ba7aa	i am not a health expert and am only passing on what i have been told by my trainers. This is not about losing weight quickly but about jump starting your system once more. the simplest answer is to change up your routine. if you have been doing a certain exercise regimen that has helped you, keep at it but switch it up a bit. At the gym, take a different type of class, body sculpt, spinning, latin dance, in the same time slot that you had been doing a step class, for example. if you exercise at home, buy new tapes/DVDs that use different methods, try Pilates or yoga as well, as these things also help to sculpt your body differently.<br>  These things give you system a little jolt..and keep switching it up, the body is a remarkably adaptable machine!!!<br>  In the meantime you might discover something new and fun that you like to do :)|`|d19ea211568e209cb993f9b9d207a782aa	Many people ask me how they can slim down.  I recommend that people eat right and exercise. However, if they would like a little "help", I suggest using natural Hoodia (it's important to note that not all Hoodia works well, even if the bottle says "pure" or "standard").<br>  <br>  The Hoodia sold at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y389on" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/y389on</a> is in my opinion the best Hoodia on the market. It's pure, has no side effects, and they give you a free 15 day sample (there is a $7.99 shipping and handling charge, but they also give you free recipe and diet guides).  Fantastic results have been seen with this particular Hoodia.

One of those things is called "Scarzone".  They are a little pricey, but they do help.<br>  <br>  Neosporin will help minimize scars by using it to help the wound heal without infection.<br>  <br>  You will also want to keep it out of the sun until the pinking line of the scar turns the same color as the rest of your skin.  Sun makes scars more prominent.

bdf256c829709d6bb28a0171c4607e74aa	The alignment of your teeth has nothing to do with your recessive chin. The recessed chin would have to be corrected  surgically with possibly an implant or maybe a realignment. Your best bet would to have the braces done and see if straighter teeth will help your overall appearance before you resort to a surgical solution. sometimes the straighter teeth will create the illusion of a more uniform facial contour.|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	Surgery.  You may need a chin implant.  I'm not kidding.  Straight teeth will help, but it won't bring your chin out any further.  Definitely needs surgery.|`|90adc70d307e2ea672c98adbedad7186aa	your kidding right<br>  <br>  no, sugery does that not braces|`|AA12136927	I'm a dentist.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, it needs to be determined whether or not you actually have a "recessive" chin.  There are other cosmetic defects that can make your chin look inadequate, such as flared maxillary teeth and excessive maxillary incisor overjet.  Such problems are dental in nature, and are often readily corrected with orthodontic therapy.   There exist, however, skeletal problems that sometimes need surgery to correct, such as maxillary hyperplasia.  It is also possible that your entire mandible--as opposed to just your chin--is hypoplastic (i.e. inadequate in length).  Excessive fat underneath your chin may make the problem worse.<br>  <br>  Sometimes skeletal problems can be masked a little by orthodontic treatment, but sometimes they cannot.  It depends on your situation.<br>  <br>  Your orthodontist will take a radiograph called a "lateral cephalometric", and will evaluate it.  He/she will take various measurements and compare them with known cosmetically-sound averages, and thus will determine what your needs are.  He/she will refer you to an oral surgeon for any problems that require surgical treatment.<br>  <br>  Should your problem be as simple as an inadequate chin, treatment can include a chin implant or a procedure called "genioplasty".<br>  <br>  Chin implants can be custom or stock, meaning the implant can be made to fit your bone specifically or it can be a ready-made product.  Needless to stay, stock implants are more expensive.  Altough I have a year of training in oral/maxillofacial surgery, I am nevertheless not an oral surgeon so I cannot tell you whether or not there is a cosmetic difference between the two.  I'd imagine, though, that if one exists it'd be slight.<br>  <br>  The surgery is quite simple.  I've assisted with it before, and I'm sure I could do it if I wanted to.  Basically, the surgeon makes an incision in the mucosa below your mandibular incisors and dissects down to your bone.  He/she then creates a space for the implant to go where it's needed, and sometimes places a screw (or two) to hold the implant against the bone.  You're sutured up, a proper dressing is placed around your chin (to prevent hematoma formation and to help keep the prosthesis in place), and you're good to go.  The procedure can be done with intravenous sedation or under general anesthesia in an OR or surgery center--doctor's choice.  Over time, a fibrous "sac" or "capsule" develops around the implant, and the rest is history.<br>  <br>  Genioplasty is a bit more complicated and definitely more surgically involved, as it requires cutting and repositioning bone from your mandible.  Access is typically the same as with chin implants (i.e. intraoral), although if necessary, an extraoral access can be made (and well hidden).  A bone saw is used to cut off your chin, which is then moved to its desired position and held in place with titanium plates and screws.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, deficient chins require a little bit of submental (i.e. under-the-chin) liposuction to help make the chin more pronounced.<br>  <br>  The risks are quite low.  Obviously, bleeding, infection, hematoma formation, damage to teeth, etc.  All quite rare.  Also, there is a small chance of damaging either of the mental nerves, which supply sense of touch to the right and left halves of your chin and lower lip.  Again, not likely.<br>  <br>  The difference in appearance is quite nice, so if you're interested in having a more pronounced chin, you'll very likely be happy with your surgery.
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	In short - yes you can.<br>  <br>  First things first 'cherry popped' is a very vulgar way of describing when your hymen is broken, it is normally used by immature boys who believe breaking your hymen is the same as taking your virginity and regard that as some sort of trophy – it's a pretty offensive way to address your own body. <br>  <br>  Some girls aren't born with hymens at all and you may have a very different hymen to what you might think or what you might consider normal, although people say your hymen breaking is painful that isn't always the case, it is just as likely to not be painful or even be pleasurable, you may have broken your hymen without knowing. <br>  <br>  You can see if your hymen is in tact or not by simply looking, try sitting comfortably and using a mirror to look at your vulva (external part of your genitals) to see the vaginal opening. <br>  <br>  The hymen is different from girl/woman to girl/woman but usually if in tact it will look like a ring of flesh around the opening to your vagina; where as if broken it will look like flaps of skin around the vaginal opening. <br>  <br>  There is a good site that shows images, not photos, of the hymen so you know what to look for here - <a href="http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengallery.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengalle...</a> - if you want to see photos then try this site - <a href="http://www.the-clitoris.com/f_html/hymen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-clitoris.com/f_html/hymen...</a>|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	Uh......yeah.

06ed48a8325f6133b5fc1d79b2406128aa	I am in the US and am on my 4th week of taking chantix (same thing, called chantix here). I am smoke free for 16 days and cannot say enough good things about this drug. I HATE how people bad mouth drug companies, saying it's all profit for them, etc. etc. I don't think anybody understands jsut how much money goes into research and development and how many drugs fail before making it to market. I am a pharmacologist and a researcher at a top university in the US (no financial interest in any drug company). The science behond this drug's mechanism of action makes perfect sense for smoking cessation. The clinical trials conducted with this drug suggest it is 2-4 times as effective as cold turkey. These were well controlled studies. From personal experience, this is the easiest quit ever. You still have to really want to quit, but when you do, the chantix makes it much more bearable. It is expensive, and this is the ONLY reason it is not being prescribed more frequently on the NHS in the UK. When calculated, it costs the same as a pack-a-day habit here so probably even less in the UK where cigarettes are more expensive.<br>  <br>  Also, if you join www.quitnet.com (there is a free membership option) you will be able to find a club called "chantix users". Read for yourself what people are saying about this. It has been on the market in the US much longer than in the UK and since people here have the option of buying the drug themselves with a prescription from the doctor many more people are taking it. I was lucky, my insurance covered it. My GP is raving about it. In the last 5 months she has put 20 patients on the drug and only one has relapsed.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the rant, but it frustrates me that people try to answer a question with no clue what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever method you choose to quit smoking.|`|AA10724752	I don't smoke and I'v not heard of champix.

I cannot remember the specific sites I visited, but it is quite easy to check the research - and the many critiques subsequently published.  It seems that Champix is NOT going to be 'THE' 'wonder' cure for smoking (the results were not significantly better than Nicotinel when adjusted) -  and that the clinical trials of the drug were heavily 'skewed'.  (For example, participants in trials were carefully screened, and those most addicted were excluded - in order to hype up the results....).  The porential for horrifying side-effects from Champix is also clearly evident in the research undertaken.  So I wouldn't get too enthusiastic....<br>  Actually the most promising thing I ever heard of was ....I was watching an episode (some time back) of LA Law and one of the secretaries would regularly bring her boss a vial of green liquid - which apparently insured that cigarettes tasted so awful, you couldn't bear them.

I got horrible stretch marks, as did my mother. But not one of my 4 other sisters did. Go figure. They all have soft thin tissue like skin. I have tough, dry, thick muscular feeling skin. I lubed myself daily through my pregnancy, with anything and everything suggested to me. Nothing helped. Lotion will help with the itchiness a little.

MieK447saa	Having a little scent is normal, but if the odor is strong, and have smelly discharge, it could be sign of infection.

5rsN7VsUaa	Hello, just wanted to let you know of a miracle pill that puts you to sleep, available over the counter, is actually very very beneficial for your health,and is only 3 bucks!! I had trouble falling asleep for years. I would lay in bed, and think and think and think for hours before I could fall asleep. It was literally driving me crazy!!  I had tried every over the counter sleeping pill on the market and nothing helped. I turned to Nyquil and that did the trick. I had been drinking Nyquil almost every night to go to sleep until I stumbled upon this miracle sanity saving nutritional supplement named MELATONIN. And you can buy it at any GNC health food store. I advocate GNC because the melatonin they use goes through 85 different quality checks before its bottled. Buy the sublingual melatonin. The kind that dissolves underneath your tongue tastes like cherries and it’s good for you!! I was shocked at the effectivness in putting me to sleep. If you have any questions before you buy it the sales associate at GNC should be able to answer any questions you have. It comes in 1 mg, I take 2 right before bed. The only side effects are weird dreams for the first two nights if any at all. Should be taken at regular bedtimes in the evening. <br>  God Bless<br>  P.S. after you try it and it works don’t forget to tell others about it. You could be saving someone else’s Sanity|`|b1znvwnJaa	The same thing happens to me and its really annoying getting up for school!<br>  <br>  try having warm hot chocolate before you go to bed<br>  do u exercise enough in the day?|`|6G0QSZPdaa	Like above, exercise.

Do you drink sodas, do you eat a lot of sugar? this alone could keep you awake. if you eat the wrong foods late in the day it stimulates the liver which goes into overdrive and you are so "awake' your mind keeps spinning.  Try changing your diet to more healthy one, stop any hyperactive foods after noon, take a drink of hot milk with honey, watch only or read only relaxing things before betime.  Take 1000 mg Calcium along with 500mg magnesium  and one Vit D 30 minutes before bedtime with the milk and some non sugar crackers.  Think or meditate on pleasant things and listen to calming music.

7xkfdm9haa	Hola. Lo más recomendable es que los dos vayan a un especialista y que les receten un tratamiento a ambos, aún si no tienen molestias, ya que, con mucha frecuencia, las infecciones son asintomáticas (es decir que no causan molesatias), sobre todo en el hombre, pero esto no quiere decir que no estén ahí. <br>  Además, si uno de los dos se trata y el otro no, se corre el riesgo de una reinfección y, lo que es peor, de que se genere 'resistencia bacteriana', es decir, que el bicho se haga más fuerte y los tratamientos dejen de hacer efecto o necesiten medicinas más potentes (y probablemente más caras).<br>  Otro consejo: NO TE AUTOMEDIQUES. Aunque los medicamentos para las infecciones vaginales se venden sin receta médica, es importantísimo que un médico te diagnostique (o mejor dicho, los diagnostique a ambos) porque los mismos síntomas podrían ser se?al de diferentes enfermedades, no necesariamente producidas por el mismo tipo de bicho: si es bacteria, el antibiótico sí que será la solución, pero si es virus, no.<br>  Vayan los dos al médico, sin pena y sin recriminaciones (las infecciones no son 'culpa' de alguien, sino responsabilidad de ambos). Recuerda que el tratamiento oportuno te ahorrará muchos problemas, tanto de salud física y emocional, como económicos.|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	muchas veces el hombre puede tener ese tipo de infecciones pero asintomatica eso kiere decir k no le pikason  y si tu tienes esa infeccion lo mejor sera k el tambien se trate|`|4c258fb6d1883b85cf0b9acb3a1956a1aa	asi es ambos se tienen que tratar, tu poniendote ovulos y el una pomada, tienes que evitar tener relacion por el tiempo del tratamiento, que normalemte son 10 dias. púedes usar los ovulos de canesten y la pomanda del mismo|`|80b30613618569f192a98d0fd3dbb549aa	Los dos deben hacerse el tratamiento, pues los hombres son asintomaticos a este tipo de infecciones, deben abstenerse de tener relaciones mientras dure el tratamiento.|`|kq1aue7Vaa	si al igual que tu deben de segui el mismo tratamiento para que la infeccion no se la esten contagian entre los dos|`|ff1c93eb49c8d995aca5795793dea00daa	Si deben tratarse, ya q si el esta contagiado y tu tomas medicamento volveras a infectarte una y otra vez y el medicamento ya no funcionara igual.|`|eed70c9eff0e9ff39e1dc5c34af0c7f6aa	claroq ue ambos tienen que tomar le tratamiento para prevenir, por que muchas infecciones vaginales, no le afectan al hombree, o de plano no tienen  sintomas en ninguno de los 2, pero es recomendable que se traten ambos...

g8PyakXYaa	Okay, I’m going to be a little tough on you in my answer, because i want to tell you my honest opinion of what you just said. I know Being bipolar is hard, but it’s like any other problem in life, you have to learn to overcome it. You seem to be using it like an excuse, not something your working on. <br>  So you love him but your tired? That tells me you have no idea what love is. That is not an insult, in fact few people do. Love is not fun. It is freakishly hard work. being tired is just the half of it. It gets extremely hard- you know why? because people are flawed and love is about seeing past that. Love is holding on to someone never giving up. <br>  I would also like to say that you have a child with him, and the 2 other kids have known him and the father figure for 2 years. you take him away then you are taking away the person who is daddy. When you do that, you are riping out a part of your kids. make sure that if you leave someone it’s worth destroying a part of your children in the process.<br>  He tells you what to do all the time? he won’t let you do anything with your child? Do you honestly think that you have no blame in your relationship? Do you think you are a victim at all times? Take  moment and think about how you could be better for him, heck take a day. Do everything for him. when I feel my husband and I get in a rut and things are filled with fighting, I just take a day to shut my mouth and make sure that I am taking care of him. I spend that day making sure that he is treated like I would like to be treated, and guess what- when you love someone and treat them that way- they will treat you that way back.<br>  Next you said you have a problem with him punishing your children that are not his, but he’s your fiance? So you both are planning to get married and you feel like just because his sperm is not what made those kids he has no right to them? that’s depressing. Be happy that he’s trying to help out. If you have a problem with the WAY he’s doing it then you both need to sit down and talk about punishing the kids in a way you both feel good.  <br>  Your “question” isn’t really a question. It’s more of you just talking about how unhappy you are. If you have any problem with my answer then remember that no one on yahoo knows you, and yet you are asking them to help you. You know who DOES know you? Your man. He knows you, and you need to be talking with him, not with a bunch of people on some chat site. <br>  It’s time to grow up for your marriage, your children and yourself. <br>  <br>  P.S. Use your bipolar disorder to help your children. Show them that no matter how hard things are they can overcome the odds and be the pest person possible. Wake up each morning and deal with your disorder as though you are a pillar of strength. because you have to be so that those babies will grow up and see that being beautiful is living with problems and overcoming them, no matter how hard. <br>  I recommend you read the boundaries series by Dr. Henry Cloud. They helped me, maybe they will help you.|`|976aa08aea43900b0d8216b1ef132c4baa	You need to get out of that situation. He's a control freak and it's not going to get any better.|`|2ac1d4423b273643309cd77f9e43d50faa	Everyone says leave him! I know it's not that easy to do. If you were diagnosed as bi-polar, you are difficult to live with, I can guarantee you. Are you medicated? You SHOULD be! Are you going to counselling? You SHOULD be! Do it for yourself, first, then your children.<br>  <br>  Ok, so he's abusive (verbally) which makes him a rat, dirty no-good dog. You ALLOW him to do this to you, step up to the bat and don't allow him to treat you this way. We can only be abused if we allow it. IF he won't stop, throw his butt out! I am serious...those type of people deserve to live alone.<br>  <br>  DON'T let him verbally abuse your CHILDREN!! You can lose them in an instant.|`|19c845d1ea148e5ee4b55d5a4d62c5caaa	Most of the time when people announce that they are bi-polar they are actually Borderline Personality Disorder.<br>  <br>  Are you on your medications right now? If you are not, this could cause some of those feelings.<br>  <br>  See a therapist to help you out.  No one should stay in an unhappy relationship but you have major mental hx issues with the "bi-polar" and you could possibly be in a depressive state.|`|9b2c9fbacf1de45417983e585eadccbbaa	Very sad of that ! just leave him and move on with life.|`|ciwCqKUfaa	leave that is the only option|`|JCY4kMrbaa	PERHAPS he is doing his best in a difficult position<br>  Being bipolar you experience terrible highs and lows.<br>  IF YOU THINK HE IS BEING UNFAIR then tell him IF he continues then discuss the matter with your therapist.<br>  YOU MIGHT HAVE TO END UP GOING IT ALONE|`|paY6lxUlaa	you bipolar uuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmm already crazy. duh.

oVVQWcJ4aa	yes.  i have had that before and didn't go to the dr and i was ok.  in fact i have had it quite a few times.  if it is severe enough, you can get really sick or die.<br>  <br>  Burns destroy skin and the loss of skin can lead to infection, dehydration and hypothermia (loss of body heat). Make sure that burn victims get emergency medical help if experiencing any of the following: <br>  dizziness or confusion <br>  weakness <br>  fever or chills <br>  shivering <br>  cold sweats<br>  <br>  Acute Sun Damage is most commonly known as sunburn, which causes redness and peeling. Damage to the skin from sunburn can last a lifetime. It is now recognized that sunburn and sun exposure should not be taken as something insignificant. Deaths have resulted from acute sun exposure and significant temporary disability is experienced by millions of sunburned people each year. Sun damage of the skin, also known as photo damage can be either acute, as in a sunburn or more commonly, chronic, seen as gradual changes in the skin caused by an accumulation of sun exposure throughout one's life. Symptoms may begin as soon as 1 hour after exposure and typically reach their peak after 1 day. Some severely sunburned people develop a fever, chills, and weakness and on rare occasions even may go into shock. Sunburn is a serious risk factor for skin cancer and for sun damage such as wrinkles. <br>  <br>  When to seek further professional advice <br>  <br>  your sunburn blisters and is accompanied by chills, fever, or nausea. Severe sunburn requires professional care to limit the risk of infection and to prevent dehydration. <br>  <br>  your eyes are extremely painful and feel gritty. You should have your eyes examined by an ophthalmologist to determine whether the corneas are damaged.<br>  ____________<br>  <br>  SUNBURN: TREATING & PREVENTING <br>   <br>  Sunburn Symptoms<br>  Sunburn symptoms include:<br>  Skin redness, dry skin, and skin irritation. It may take up to 24 hours for people to experience symptoms of sunburn after sun exposure without protection (or without adequate protection). <br>  <br>  People with sunburn may have skin peeling and flaky skin, as well as skin that is extremely warm to the touch. Sunburn can be very painful. <br>  <br>  Severe sunburn may involve blistering of the skin, dehydration, and infection. These symptoms may quickly progress to nausea, chills, flu-like symptoms, and headaches. <br>  <br>  Sunburn treatment includes:<br>  Cool your loved one as rapidly as possible by applying cool, damp cloths all over the area or immersing your loved one entirely in cool ( not cold) water.<br>  Give your loved one cool fluids to drink, such as water.<br>  Treat your loved one for first or second degree burns.<br>  Treat for shock if necessary.<br>  Get professional medical help immediately for severe cases.|`|e0af25a7a52f26cb654683cd39018a7faa	Absolutely.... a severe sunburn, if its a second degree burn, will give you blisters, chills and pain!

Category 5 is people who are generally well and are at no risk of adverse events through waiting to see a healthcare professional.<br>  <br>  THIS is from the website listed below:<br>  <br>  Emergency department triage categories<br>  Triage category 1: need for resuscitation - patients seen immediately. People in this group are critically ill and require immediate attention. Most arrive at the emergency department by ambulance. This group includes people whose heart may have stopped beating, whose blood pressure may have dropped to dangerously low levels, who may be barely breathing or have stopped breathing, who may have suffered a critical injury or who may have had an overdose of intravenous drugs and be unresponsive. <br>  Triage category 2: emergency - patients seen within 10 minutes. People in this group will probably be suffering a critical illness or very severe pain. For example, the group includes people with serious chest pain likely to be related to a heart attack, people with difficulty breathing and people with severe fractures. <br>  Triage category 3: urgent - patients seen within 30 minutes. People in this group include patients suffering from severe illnesses, people with head injuries but who are conscious, and people with major bleeding from cuts, major fractures, persistent vomiting or dehydration. <br>  Triage category 4: semi-urgent - patients seen within 60 minutes. People in this group usually have less severe symptoms or injuries, although the condition may be potentially serious. Examples include people with mild bleeding, a foreign body in the eye, a head injury (but where the patient never lost consciousness), a sprained ankle, possible bone fractures, abdominal pain, migraine or earache. <br>  Triage category 5: non-urgent - patients seen within 120 minutes. People in this group usually have minor illnesses or symptoms that may have been present for more than a week, like rashes or minor aches and pains. The group includes people with stable chronic conditions who are experiencing minor symptoms.|`|AA10208357	5<br>  <br>  see 1 2 3 4 5|`|UIEhdnxWaa	I am an ER nurse.  I presume you are asking about the triage level assigned to you in an ER?  Many facilities use what is called an ESI level 5 system.  Others use a 3 level system.  Sounds like that is what you are asking about.<br>  Level 1: existing life -threatening/ life ending: (eg:)Cardiac arrest in progress. <br>  Level 2: potential  immediate life-threatening; emergent: (eg:)Acute heart attack ( which can become level 1); drug overdose with coma; multiple trauma ( penetrating, blunt or burn)<br>  Level 3: requires care and attention, not emergent, using 2 or more resources like: X-ray; lab; medication; referral. <br>  Level 4 & 5: Not emergent; clinic level.  Could be seen in 'fast track' or Minor care/urgent care setting.  Using 1 or no resources.
hqM8zNkHaa	It's okay, but as a one time situation. I mean, afterwards make sure you put it as you should... You don't want all that hard work to waste :P|`|cGhMQ4jEaa	do you have the plastic ones that are formed to your teeth or the hard plastic with a meatal bar? well the soft plastic kind suck ***! i've had both. the hard plastic with metal are good. if your teeth move any you can get the kind that have a "key" in the middle so you can tighten them so they will get back to normal i used to have those then i got the soft platic ones that are formed to your teeth after my braces and my mom threw them out now my teeth are back to square one >=O|`|AA11054885	Your teeth will likely move a bit - how much will depend on how your teeth respond to not being restrained.  I am almost done with my braces and when they put on powerchains to close gaps, especially my front teeth, the effect was immediate - all the gaps were gone by the time I went to bed that night.<br>  <br>  the thing with retainers is that they're there to keep your teeth in their proper, corrected place until the bone is fixed and not likely to move.  Everyone's teeth move, whether they've had braces or not, had retainers or not, had extractions or not.  <br>  <br>  So yes, your teeth will move - to what degree is anyone's guess.  But the good news is that once you get the retainer fixed or replaced, after some discomfort they'll be back to where they need to be.  If they're really out of whack, your orthodontist may suggest a couple brackets to get them back in line.  I'd call them for sure asap and just find out what they will do if the alignment is super way off.
fM0r8sd2aa	The only way to lose weight is to consume less calories than you burn.<br>  <br>  To lose weight, experts agree you need to exercise for at least 30 minutes at 60%-70% of your Max Heart Rate (MHR). A simple way to calculate MHR is 220 minus your age. So if you’re 45 years old, for example, your MHR would be 220-45=175. 60% of 175 is 105, and 70% of 175 is 122.5. So you should exercise daily for 30 minutes at a heart rate between 105 and 123.<br>  <br>  You don’t need additional equipment—infomercial products like the Ab Lounger, Sauna Belt, etc. are all worthless gimmicks so don’t waste your money.<br>  <br>  Eat breakfast, and eat five small meals per day instead of three big meals. On the other hand, if you don't wake up ravenous, then you ate too much the day before. Stop eating at least two hours before you go to bed. Cut back on the foods you eat with high fat and high sugar content. Eat only single servings (read the label) with less than 3 grams trans fat and 3 grams sugars. Become familiar with websites like <a href="http://chubbyloser.com" rel="nofollow">http://chubbyloser.com</a> that contain good information on what to eat, including supplements.<br>  <br>  Don't consume alcohol—alcohol is nothing more than empty calories with no nutritional value. Some people will argue that alcohol has some health benefits when consumed in moderation—I’m not debating that—but we’re talking about weight loss here. Lay off the booze if you want to lose the belly.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water, then drink more. Not tea, not Gatorade, not milk. Water. If your urine isn’t almost clear, you need to drink more water. <br>  <br>  Woof.|`|4sO99Aaeaa	reduce beer......dtlts|`|AA10037458	Stop drinking beer.|`|cc36OQ5haa	Dude dont drink and dont eat cheese burgers!!!|`|0SMmj1uLaa	Standard diet and exercise.

I had just had a baby & was already over weight. I can't tell you for sure if I did, but I will admit I didn't lose. I don't know if that was from depression, the Zoloft, having 3 young children and being my first year of homeschooling, a new baby in the house and so on . . . It did help me a lot though. <br>  <br>  I am now off it and doing fine.|`|AA12225401	Gaining weight on Zoloft is a very common side effect.
IuvOMFp3aa	Exercise is a wonder drug, truly.  Ever since I was diagnosed as bipolar, I've been in the gym 4-5x a week.  It's incredibly effective.<br>  <br>  As for supplements, try to get as much Omega-3 as you can into your diet.  I take fish oil caplets.  They don't taste bad, but you may burp up some salmon here and there.<br>  <br>  Omega-3's are very instrumental in regulating moods and helping the brain produce more serotonin (just like ssri's, but only more natural).   I switched from butter to Smart Balance, Barilla makes omega-3 enriched pastas now, I snack on nuts (high concentration of omega-3) instead of other things.<br>  <br>  My pdoc advised me to take 5000mg fish oil caplets per day and I have really seen a difference.  Now, I'm sure that could be the placebo effect, but whatever it is, it does help.<br>  <br>  Also, with a lot of people, taking ssri's w/o a mood stabilizer can actually create more problems and mood swings.  By mood stabilizer I mean a class of drugs called atypical anti-psychotics.  They sound sinister, but the only side effects I experienced was I felt groggy in the morning for about a week.  Then all the side effects went away and it's great to take one before bed because you get get to sleep really easily.  <br>  <br>  My anxiety has pretty much all gone away.  My father is on the same med (symbyax) and he takes it for anxiety as well.  He only needs one every 3-4 days and he feels great.|`|45de80e7f5760d4fa91a6f9c1c0f1446aa	have any of your doctor's tried benzodiazapenes for the panic attacks, I am taking klonopin, and it works great, i am experiencing no side effects (i take 1mg a day). I also take 50mg a day of zoloft, how long did you try ssri's for, because if they aren't titrated properly they will make you more anxious. this happened to me, so the doc cut me back to 25 mg, then 37.5 mg, and eventually 50 mg.
j8Ooe7a4aa	Doctors don't know everything. Go back down to 25 mg. and see how that works. If you don't have panic attacks, it works.|`|vvPL4f4Faa	As a healthcare provider I would always encourage you to talk to your provider. But I would like to clarify a few things. Yes, not only is 25mg not a theurapeutic level...this is also a drug (like all antidepressants) that take at least 4-6 weeks for affect. If you took 25mg for two weeks and thought it was wonderful....you see how that is a little questionable. Also, the side effects you are describing are common for the first one to two weeks as your body gets used to a theurapeutic level. Usually after that time, most of the effects die down and the good effects start to come to the front. By starting you on a very low dose I'm sure your provider was hoping to ease you into this and maybe you would not notice those beginning 'getting used to ' side effects. I usually just start patients out on a theurapeutic dose and tell them to bear with me for one to two weeks. PLEASE. I tell them if people stop the drug it's usually in those first two weeks cuz' they're not feeling better and are only feeling side effects. During this time I will give a one time script of Ativan or Klonopin (I will not repeat the med) to get them through the transition and untill the med kicks in. But there are also many drugs we could go to and try......but I'd still give you the lecture about staying on it for a month at theurapeutic dose before we decide.  This is a long term therapy......hang in there. In this day and age we can help you live a better life.|`|rL1uzID4aa	Hi,<br>  There is this guide by anxiety expert Joe Barry , he has taught thousands of people to be panic free without any medication using a revolutionary new technique, <a href="http://www.panicaway.co.nr" rel="nofollow">http://www.panicaway.co.nr</a>  ,  its really a great guide , it should help you get rid of panic attacks forever in a few days<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you and wish you the best of health|`|hwvPnmpraa	I have taken many different anxiety/panic/depression medications and Zoloft was probably my least favorite. Everything you are experiencing is a side effect of the medication. After upping your dosage I don't suggest going back down due to the fact that it make make the effects worse. Go back to your doctor and tell him you want a different prescription. Most medications will give you a little different of a result. I suggest asking about Effexor.<br>  Majority of medications will give you heart palpatations though - atleast from what I experienced. So I'm not sure if you can really stray away from that icky feeling.|`|id7aVii3aa	Get your doc to put you over to a different med! Its not doing you any good if its causing you extra problems.  Make sure when getting off Zoloft you follow  the docs orders to the tee cos the getting off it side effects can be worse than during (not trying to scare you just informing) I was lucky I was in hospital at the time so I was fully monitored cos my blood pressure just crashed and I could hardly stand up without fainting for a couple of days. Unfortunately it can take a few different meds for the docs to find on that works for you.  I've been on Effexor ever since I was taken off the Zoloft but I'm still running on a dose of 300mg after more than 2 years. unfortunately mental heath is always about the long term, chin up, keep going and keep positive.  Good Luck
Hb87eRq9aa	quizas lo que tenga para decirte no es lo que hace toda la gente, pero en verdad yo creo en la castidad en el noviazgo, creo que tener relaciones con la persona que amas es algo muy bello, es por eso que el fruto de esto es la vida, pero el amor es algo muy grande, bien definido no?, considero que amas a una persona plenamente cuando estas dispuesto a entregar toda tu vida a esa persona y eso es cuando eliges casarte y formar una familia juntos. Ante todo cuida tu corazon, no adelantes tiempos ni etapas.

We do not go by A, B, C, or even D cup implants. We go by cc's or amount of saline (water) that we fill into an implant. It is not true that we won't fill a breast to a B size. It depends on how firm your breast tissue is. If it is firm enough the physician can keep you at that size. If you skin is too elastic though it may be impossible. Find a reputable doctor...most will do a free consultation if you ask for one.

Catechins are antioxidants that have been shown to be 100 times more powerful than vitamin C and 25 times more powerful than Vitamin E.<br>  <br>  Antioxidants protect our body cells from oxidative damage. As we grow older, we need more of them.<br>  <br>  Consuming foods and beverages rich in antioxidants help to slow down aging and prevent heart disease and cancers.<br>  <br>  Just 3 grams of green tea leaves brew a cup of tea. That cup of tea contains as much catechins as 10 cups of red wine and 200 grams of dark chocolate.<br>  <br>  There are many fruits rich in antioxidants, but gram for gram and dollar for dollar, none of them packs as much punch as green tea.<br>  <br>  Green tea has virtually no calorie. It helps lose weight by increasing metabolism and fat burning. Studies have found that combining green tea with exercise are highly effective in promoting weight loss.<br>  <br>  BEST TEA TO DRINK (first link)<br>  <br>  Unfortunately too many people drink the wrong kinds of green tea. The 2007 US Department of Agriculture study shows why.<br>  <br>  100 millimetres of regular green tea contains 127 milligrams of catechins. <br>  <br>  Decaffeinated green tea contains only 56 milligrams.<br>  <br>  Flavored brewed green tea has 43 milligrams.<br>  <br>  Bottled green tea has only 12 milligrams.<br>  <br>  It seems that the longer green tea has been processed, the more nutrients it loses. A popular decaffeination method involves soaking tea leaves in a chemical solvent called ethyl acetate. Bottled green tea has phosphoric acids added to it.<br>  <br>  3 grams of loose-leaf brew 1 cup of tea, which gives you the same amounts of catechins found in 5 teabags.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, that same 3 grams of tea leaves can be infused another 2 times without losing its favour, while containing all the nutrients.<br>  <br>  So not only does loose-leaf taste better, it is also healthier and work out cheaper!<br>  <br>  WHAT DOES IT TO?<br>  <br>  Whole lots of things, green tea has many health benefits. Check up the second link.<br>  <br>  I hope it helps! Green tea is great!<br>  <br>  Julian

189d3d15c868f8a9a7d1acca7422ea51aa	From your description, it does look like you were circumcised too tightly and there's not quite enough skin to cover an erection, so skin from the base and the scrotum pulls up onto the shaft a little.  This isn't too uncommon in circumcised men, which is a kind of complication I guess.<br>  <br>  There are several things you could do.  The first of them being do nothing.  Over time with more erections, the skin will stretch out until it's more comfortable.  This could take many years and the erections in between will be more or less like they are now.<br>  <br>  You could massage your penis with a special skin cream or lotion to help make the skin more supple and flexible.  There might be lotions out there that can help make the skin more stretchy and pliable so it's more comfortable.  I'm not sure, but the prescription creams used for tight/narrow foreskins could help in this case (see link 1).<br>  <br>  Lastly, you can attempt "foreskin restoration."  You don't have to go all the way if you don't want, but you might want to "restore" just enough so that it's no longer painful and really tight.  This shouldn't take too long, 1-2 months if you're consistent.  If you feel like continuing to a "full" foreskin restoration, you might find erections more comfortable, and maybe even masturbation/sex more pleasurable as the glans (penis head) becomes covered and becomes more sensitive.  This takes a long time though, 1-3 years depending on what method you do and how consistent you are.  It can take quite a bit of dedication and patience.<br>  <br>  For info on foreskin restoration, look at the remaining links.  Good luck with whatever you decide to do.|`|c85af947133f3026f95aa00dc0c60fe1aa	Indeed, if the skin on your shaft feels like it's too tight, they didn't leave some foreskin to accommodate your erections. That's why some circumcised guys it looks like they have a little skin remaining when soft, but when erect the skin seems to be gone. On the other hand, on uncircumcised guys the foreskin can just slide back to give more skin to the shaft for the erection.<br>  <br>  It's a rather tricky thing, because you can't add more skin as easily as you can remove it. My advice would be to talk it over with a urologist and see what he proposes.<br>  <br>  Consider what the urologist says, and as the other poster said, you can also try to do just a little of the "foreskin restoration" technique; not enough to restore your foreskin (that would take a year or two!), but just enough to see if you can stretch out a few more millimeters of skin so it'll better accommodate your erections. Perhaps that could just be done in a month.|`|AA10283405	Your assumption about your circumcision is correct. It can be corrected with minor surgery. See a urologist.|`|AA10640375	if u r that botherd by it go to a doctor but u know girls will like that.|`|VHM0OxFyaa	Have you considered penial skin streching?

One of my roommates has a similar problem although his is just really tight and not painful.<br>  <br>  The best thing I can suggest is to research the foreskin restoration techniques that involve stretching the skin you have to make a better fit. While you may not want to go all the way and create a 'foreskin', the same process will help you loosen up enough to remove the pain.|`|dc23d915c788a539c23011716b7e3703aa	it is a common problem with big sized penis<br>  i think u shud consult a doc.

I am not a vegitarian|`|AA12314669	Nothing anyone on here said is actually proven.  Lifting weights, from what I have been told though, just increases the amount of free testosterone, but does not produce more testosterone.  <br>  Steriods and other hormones are the only thing that were surely increase your testerone levels.  Everything else you do is theoretical, not much proof.|`|OspiwVTJaa	Actually weight lifting temporarily depletes testosterone, as does excessive masturbation.  It's a normal side effect.<br>  <br>  The best way to increase your testosterone levels naturally is to increase your omega-3 intake and take an inexpensive supplement called ZMA an hour before bedtime. It's made up of a combination of Zinc, Magnesium, and B-6. It works really well, another side effect of ZMA is that it makes you sleep like a baby and wake up refreshed in the morning.|`|VHM0OxFyaa	Yes it does!! When you do something competitive like weight training (you compete with a lifting partner or yourself), your body releses testostrone so you can stay top dog.  You also release more testostrone when you get a promotion, win a competition, or anything else that demonstrates your supirority over someone else.|`|i8gkxMrdaa	There are no studies to say that anything like weight lifting increases testosterone levels. Sex-Limited genes that are responsible for androgens, which are responsible for tesosterone, are only effected with toxins such as steroid use, which change your levels....So no, weight lifting wont increase it, dont worry.

If you are less than twenty inches you are in deep trouble. Penises come in a variety of sizes. Your penis size will be the size you are given! There are no pills or creams, no toys or tools that will make a penis longer or larger. Any product claiming to do that should be regarded as being suspect. Likely it is a scam and the only thing that will get bigger is the wallet or bank account of the person/company offering the product. Look closely at the promotions and you will see that the product is not tested, inspected, approved or endorsed by any reputable organization. If it works why has it not been submitted to the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration for FDA Approval. If you are concerned that your penis is not large enough then consider that the average length is 5.5 inches and frankly that is plenty large enough. Read some of the posts from females who are afraid of the "huge" penises out there. Sure the "American thing" is "bigger is better" but that is not always the case. If you are concerned about the ladies pleasure - and that should be your main concern, you should develop a technique or style that makes the most out of what you were given. <br>  It is important to remember that sexual intercourse is not simply a piston going back and forth at a high speed. Actually a lot of the "jocks" haven't figured that out yet. If you work at developing a style you will score more and it will be more fun for both of you.<br>  And it will be fun learning the technique.<br>  And if you are still wanting to do something to make your penis bigger, each night before you climb into bed, get down on your knees, bow your head, and pray for a larger penis. Trust me, you stand a better chance this way than with any tools or toys.|`|AA11707062	It is very common for people your age to be concerned about their growth and whether they are the same as others. Penis length varies from man to man. The penis grows more rapidly sometime between the ages of 11 and 17. The genitals usually reach adult shape and size by the time a man reaches 18-20 years of age. The average penis is 4 - 6 inches long when it is erect. Everyone is different, so a penis that is larger or smaller is still normal.|`|VHM0OxFyaa	It depends on genetics, but the average penis is 5 inches long.  If it's bigger than 5 inches, congrats.

Walking is your best bet.|`|yzbG8823aa	umm no product can do that for you. only 30 minutes a day of cardio can.

I don't know what causes it, but it isn't a seamen bulid up because seamen is stored in the vas deferus, not the testicales.
pMRwPd3yaa	buddy just play with yourself, we all do it but in relation to the last bit of the question,<br>  im not going to help you so youl just need to do it yourself|`|dd6af0db3d12d8c19a34248c5ab57015aa	The same that your father did after he married your mother.|`|4c2cf3c2e80df7dc6a3da4a8074b786eaa	masturbation is another alternative beside sexual intercourse.|`|2085f3d85f071a5f3336d5f9388ff585aa	I'll leave it up to pain in the back or granny bce to answer this one.|`|HGLZDqLTaa	Masturbating on unless you want some one press your testicles, better masturbate|`|d4a9c3cddc1cf5733f20ef6713964d4eaa	Try to use your imagination.<br>  Because on some instances even w/o touching it or masturbation, you might produce semen.<br>  <br>  Also try to find below jobbers...|`|20OESMZbaa	masturbate|`|7CVZQ8tzaa	Do you mean like masturbate? Take your hand, rap it around your erect penis and go back and forth. This works for uncircumcised penises and some circumcised penises that still have a little skin to rub. If you are completely cicumcised, use vaseline or a cream to get yourself off. Good luck!|`|AA10255445	Sperms are eggs themselves...so?|`|db15d0e576d6d3ba7a3e3aacd92f340faa	If you mean produce as in make sperm, don't worry, a healthy man's testicles produce sperm all the time.  If you mean produce as in give a sperm sample but you don't want sex, there are several alternatives.  The first, and generally most private and simple method is masturbation.  The second, and quite a bit more complicated to accomplish is direct digital stimulation of the prostate gland (i.e. using a finger to massage your prostate through the wall of your anus).  The third, and more expensive option is to use electrical stimulation of the genitals/prostate.  This is one of the methods vets use to get sperm samples from zoo and farm animals. <br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question|`|i4cAk0ufaa	Yeah. Like get a scalpel and cut an incision exactly down the center of the left testicle. The incision should be 9/16 of an inch long and 3/16 inch deep. The little fellows will be out in no time. You should get about half a gallon.|`|ojcBhjL1aa	sperm is continually produced in the organs called testicles... it just continues, you don't even need sex because its just there... maybe you mean semen... then you might want to rephrase your question|`|wZZm1rfmaa	busy work schedule will let you do that Sir.
YbUHTPYMaa	Nothing is wrong, it is normal. :)  Now if it has a weird smell or a diffident color other than white or clear, you should go and see a doctor. <br>  <br>  The discharge is just your body's way of cleaning itself. So girls have a lot and others have a little. So no worries! You are OK! :D|`|MqWPHRBHaa	sounds like u were turned on at one point or your vagina is flushing its self. eithter way...i wouldnt worry.|`|ax133JJBaa	no dont worry, i have the same thing... every1 does! some people just have more than others, and its meant to be white!<br>  trust me           lol|`|tFam9Ckcaa	it could be a yeast problem, or possibly thrush. have it checked by your doctor to be sure honey.|`|1Z0BsJ0Kaa	if you're half way between periods it could mean you're ovulating, or if you haven't had a period yet, you could be ovulating on your first cycle. Guys love a wet vag though don't worry too much about it. It's a good sign that you're fertile and we're instinctively attracted to it.<br>  <br>  a woman who is ovulating can have up to 30 times as much discharge as she normally does at other times of the month.|`|254f0de538875521f684a111240f0e35aa	Its very normal, If u do not get it, that is abnormal as that may form a mass of tumor!<br>  U dont have to worry about it, its very normal. For me personally, the white discharge comes out everyday normally, but stops a few days before periods. May be the stuff is a self cleanser of vagina, but it is nothing harmful.|`|Jrd4QBsaaa	it may be a yeast infection which can easily be cleared up my over the counter anti-fungal cream like monistat 7 there' s many varieties...or you may have a bacterial infection.  Not all bacterial infections have an odor or have to be a green or yellowish discharge..If anything go see your physician so he can tell you exactly because if its a bacterial infection you may need flagyl or metrogel and these meds need to be prescribed..good luck dear<br>  <br>  Lucy Adv.

uvgi0Khvaa	Do you have something in your eye or crawling on your skin that would cause the twitching?  That might be it|`|AA10582172	That happens to me when I'm stressed.
CjtfNi5aaa	Actually, a lot of people wish they could be in your shoes. If you're convinced you want to ejaculate less sperm, then do what jess_tris said in her answer: ejaculate more often. If you wait a week to masturbate or have sex, you will ejaculate a lot more sperm than when doing it for the third time in the same day.<br>  <br>  I don't know why this would be a problem though. You've probably just been doing it less often than before and haven't noticed it. If it really concerns you, you could ask a doctor about it and see what s/he thinks.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11047042	The amount of ejaculate varies from person to person and changes also with the individual. It may depend on when you last masturbated, your diet, your exercise level or your fluid intake.<br>  <br>  As long as you are fit and healthy, don't worry about it. Some guys would be envious.|`|a5d3de1e0777de995a736fdcfe401cb9aa	ejaculate more often|`|AA10283855	It's normal, but it will vary. If you go awhile without ejaculating, your arousal level will be higher, you should see a difference.<br>  <br>  Paramedic in SC|`|LxPsIJp6aa	how would you know it is 3 times the amount...ewwwww|`|bC2qKZyIaa	no not at all if there is no change in the way it feels you might just have found someone who can get off a little better or u might just have figured a way to get your self off a lil better....lol
kRa4rKg8aa	There are many reasons as to why people get numbness,,,from very simple reasons to very complex reasons,,,your best bet would be to consult your doctor.|`|a483f583d86fba2438befda90e113a8caa	Two ways to go, Chiropractor(sciatica) - Podiatrist(Foot DR.) or persay a nuerologist !! You have a nerve impingment somewhere and need to find out why etc. This could lead to some serious complications !! Ever heard of GANGRENE  ???????????????|`|6deciIkYaa	you should go and see your doctor<br>  it might be serious|`|PYpQr9Mbaa	Patience, my friend, patience. I'm sure it will be gone...like try foot massaging or...hehe...going to the DOCTOR's.|`|c5696eff0a466e825d967cd6ae0e1b1eaa	This could be related to poor circulation.  You may want to have your doctor evaluate you for what is called peripheral vascular disease.|`|xhxctAOJaa	I don't understand people.<br>  <br>  <br>  GO TO THE DOCTOR!!!!!!<br>  <br>  holy crap!!!!<br>  Not that it's life threatening, but why ask here?<br>  Why not ask a professional and be done with it?
