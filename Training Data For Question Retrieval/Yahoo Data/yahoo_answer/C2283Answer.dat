2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	Good and Evil don't really reduce to anything else- they are basic, fundamental concepts.    First of all, they are social definitions which apply to how one behaves towards others.  If you're all alone on a deserted island, no action you take would be considered good or evil, because it affects no one else but yourself.    From a societal standpoint, things which are beneficial or plesant we tend to be classified as good,.while those which are harmful or unpleasant are classified as bad.  It's largely (but not entirely) subjective.  In order for something to be either good or evil, it's necessary for an intelligence of some sort to exist behind it, something which willfully chooses a particular action over another knowing the impact it will have.    For example, hurricanes and earthquakes are very destructive and harmful to people who live in areas where they occur, but they are simply natural occurences and therefore neither good nor evil.     If a tornado hits a school and kills 10 children, it would be a tragedy but again, a natural occurence- thus not evil.  On the other hand if a person entered the school and chose to kill 10 children, that is evil.    Certain behaviors are considered bad by practically all cultures- killing other members of the society, stealing from them, rape, incest etc.  All behaviors which would are harmful to the smooth functioning of the society over the long term.  It's probable that over time the impact of such behaviors was seen, which led to them being classified as bad.  It's important to note that the very same behavior applied to others who are not members of that society (outsiders, possibly enemies) might not be considered bad.    Evil might be described as a consistent preference to engage in bad actions (those which are harmful) rather than good (those which are beneficial) A necessary component for evil is that a conscious choice be made.    Some people think that evil really boils down to a lack of empathy for others- perhaps take that angle.    Anyway, I hope somewhere in all of that rambling you can find something from which to make a thesis :)

OrL7zLy9aa	First you must closely observe, recognize, and record any details (big or small) in the reading that might pertain to the character (whether it be what their physical appearance is, how they interact with other characters, their age, gender, personality, etc.)    Next, get a blank sheet of paper. In the center of the sheet write the name of the character and draw a circle around it. I recommend you not to write to large so that you will have enough space to write your ideas. Now, draw a line from the middle circle to another space on the sheet. Write a broad catagory in the space like "Appearance" for example. Then draw a small circle around it. Now around that circle, write any thoughts, ideas, and details that you found earlier in the reading.     Repeat this method throughout the entire character sketch and you are insured to get a good grade.     I wish the best of luck to you.

Then you would multiply 24 by 5 because there are 5 seats past 1 and get 120. then multiply 120 by 6 and get 3,600 which is your answer.    3)pretty much all of these questions you can solve with the method above.   1st engine can have 1 paint job and 1 radio or the second radio, same for the 2,3, and 4 paint job which equals 8. multiply 8 by 5 and get 40.    4) 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,8  1,2,3,4,5,6,8,7,9  1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,7  1,2,3,4,5,6,9,7,8  1,2,3,4,5,6,9,8,7.   since there are 6 different combinations for the last 3 people, you multiply 3 by 4 for the 6th person and get 24.  Multiply 24 by 5 and get 120. 120 by 5= 600. 600 by 6 = 3600 3600 by 7= 25200 25200 by 8=201600 201600 by 9= 1814400    Sorry I can't get the rest but it's almost bedtime. Gotta go.

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	Quick and easy answer:  the Swedish Vikings went east (into the Baltic, down the Volga River, etc), while the Norse and Danish Vikings went west (the Danes to England and down the European Atlantic coast; the Norse a little bit down the European coast, but mostly to Scotland, the Isles, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland and eventually Vinland/America).    As a result, the two cultures although sharing much in common gradually grew apart in the details.  Take clothing for instance.  Viking graves in Birka (in Sweden) show much more of an eastern influence:  Baggy trousers (as opposed to the straight-legged variety prefered by the Norse and Danes), Caftan-style riding coats (as opposed to the layered tunic & mantle look prefered in the west), pointy "Santa Claus" hats (as opposed to the round "beanie" caps prefered in the west).    Also the different groups of Viking did different things.  The Ruser (one group of Swedish Vikings) gave their name to the country we now call Russia.  Another group of Swedish Vikings, the Varangians, became famous mercenaries, who were hired as bodyguards to the Imperial Byzantine court.  On the other hand, a group of Norse Vikings were paid in land by the King of the Franks and today will still know "Normandy" by their name.  During the middle ages, the northern and eastern part of England was known as "the Danelaw" due to the high Danish Viking influence, but that name has not survied to this day.

Therefore, to calculate the probability that ALL will be male, you multiply them together, or:    Probability = (1/2) ^ 26 = 1/67,108,864 chance (since raising the 1/2 to the 26th power is the same thing as multiplying 1/2 26 times).    (P.S. If your edit was directed at me, my number IS a fraction.... 1/67,108,864)    [Edit] It's because you're actually dividing 1/(2^26) and getting a decimal value.

jIM4HpUGaa	a) a puddle will evaporate after a summer rain shower due to the fact that the precipitation is warm, and therefore the particles are moving at a faster rate. If these particles move fast enough they evaporate thus once again becoming clouds,   b) Gases filled the entire space of the container in which they are stored since the particles of gases have a lot of space between them, and they have a lot of energy they consistently bounce off one another filling the entire volume of the container.   d) The bicycle tire will be firmer in the hot afternoon as opposed to the early morning probably because the temperature in the afternoon is hotter than in the morning causing the particles to move at a faster rate, therefore expanding the gas in the tire and finally making the tire firmer.   c) Liquid water will become ice in a freezer due to the fact that it is exposed to a colder temperature, when this happens the rate that the particles [of the water] move is highly decreased, meaning they move slower and with less energy, this causes a change of phase from liguid to gas.

UYvgIazcaa	He employed the Scientific Method.  He saw that mold spores were killing bacteria in a petri-dish.  He postulated a theory, and devised tests that would help prove or disprove that theory.  He then undertook those tests which confirmed his theory that bread mold killed bacteria.  He then published his results for peer review.    (I'm guessing at all of that, but it sounds convincing to me!)|`|1khVEE6oaa	Trial and error, his discovery was entirely accidental.  He devised no tests, and formulated no hypothesis.  He just stumbled upon it.      FROM WIKIPEDIA:    Accidental discovery     Miracle cure."When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer," Fleming would later say, "But I guess that was exactly what I did." [2].    By 1928, Fleming was investigating the properties of staphylococci. He was already well-known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but quite a careless lab technician; he often forgot cultures that he worked on, and his lab in general was usually in chaos. After returning from a long holiday, Fleming noticed that many of his culture dishes were contaminated with a fungus, and he threw the dishes in disinfectant. But subsequently, he had to show a visitor what he had been researching, and so he retrieved some of the submerged dishes that he would have otherwise discarded. He then noticed a zone around an invading fungus where the bacteria could not seem to grow. Fleming proceeded to isolate an extract from the mold, correctly identified it as being from the Penicillium genus, and therefore named the agent penicillin.    He investigated its positive anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci, and indeed all Gram-positive pathogens (scarlet fever, pneumonia, meningitis, diphtheria) but unfortunately not typhoid or paratyphoid, for which he was seeking a cure at the time. It also affected gonorrhea, although this condition is caused by a Gram-negative pathogen.    Fleming published his discovery in 1929 in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology, but little attention was paid to his article. Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating penicillium was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent. Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (in vivo) to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic. In the 1930s, Flemings trials occasionally showed more promise,[3] and he continued, until 1940, to try and interest a chemist skilled enough to further refine usable penicillin.    Fleming soon abandoned penicillin, and not long after Florey and Chain took up researching and mass producing it with funds from the U.S and British governments. They started mass production after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. When D-day arrived they had made enough penicillin to treat all the wounded allied forces.

eGpOIV12aa	When Hurricane Katrina hit, the Edelman teams sprang into action. Initially, Wal-Mart's old stingy inclinations surfaced. The company contributed a measly $2 million to relief efforts and indicated that workers at stores shut down by the storm would receive only three days of additional pay. Yet it quickly switched gears. A few days later, on September 5, Lee Scott was on hand to make a $15 million contribution when former Presidents Bush and Clinton announced the launch of their private fundraising campaign for hurricane victims. Both Bush Senior and Clinton (whose wife Hillary, now a U.S. Senator from New York, used to serve as a director of Wal-Mart while she was a corporate lawyer in Arkansas) sang the praises of the company for its cash donation. Clinton also commended Wal-Mart for announcing that employees forced to flee their home because of the hurricane would be rehired at their new location.    This was only the beginning of a remarkable wave of not just good but amazing publicity for the company, which also gave away merchandise to storm victims. The fact that Wal-Mart was able to deliver relief supplies to hurricane-stricken areas while government agencies were still fumbling was depicted as nothing short of miraculous, even though it was well known that the company had in place one of the most advanced distribution systems in the world. Speaking on "Meet the Press," an official from Jefferson Parish in Louisiana said that if "the American government would have responded like Wal-Mart has responded, we wouldn't be in this crisis." The mayor of Kenner, Louisiana told National Public Radio: "The only one who could get here was the Wal-Mart Corporation.We are extremely appreciative and grateful for them, and we'd suggest that maybe some of those other folks go over and meet with the Wal-Mart people so they can learn distribution and logistics."    That theme was soon echoed in the press. The Washington Post wrote that "Wal-Mart is being held up as a model for logistical efficiency and nimble disaster planning." The Wall Street Journal declared: "The Federal Emergency Management Agency could learn some things from Wal-Mart Stores Inc." New York Times columnist John Tierney went even further: "I don't think Washington needs any more czars. But if President Bush feels compelled to put someone in charge of rebuilding the Gulf Coast, let me suggest a name: Lee Scott."    The public relations trade press marveled. In a piece headlined WAL-MART'S RELIEF EFFORTS PROVE PRICELESS, PR Week said that "a decade of media summits and press kits couldn't earn this kind of goodwill from the media." Advertising Age added: "Millions in corporate-image advertising in the past year failed to do much to help Wal-Mart's reputation, shredded by disappointing business results, news stories about its lowest-paid workers getting Medicaid and food stamps and charges of embezzlement against its multimillionaire former No. 2 executive.

To use the distributive property, you multiply all of the (3x + 2) by 2x first--giving you 6x^2 + 4x.      Then you multiply the (3x + 2) by -5 (yes, negative 5, since 'minus 5' is the same as 'plus negative 5', so you will add the answer to the first part of the answer.)--giving you -15x + -10  (or you can write it more simply as -15x - 10).    Add the two parts of the answers together:  6x^2 + 4x - 15x - 10    Simplify by adding the like terms (4x + -15x = -11x) to get:  6x^2 - 11x - 10    That's the final answer, if that's the entire problem|`|BXALhzvtaa	Is that meant to be (2x - 5) = (3X+ 2)?    in which case you're looking to move the Xs to one side and the numbers to the other so:    (2X - 5) - 2 = (3X + 2) - 2   2X - 7 = 3X  (2X - 7) - 2X = (3X) - 2X  -7 = X    If OTOH it's (2X - 5) * (3X + 2)  then it's (2X * (3X + 2) ) + (-5 * (3X +2))  6X^2 + 4X -15X -10  6X^2 -11X -10|`|1x0UAh3aaa	what does the x stand for

Fascist movements emerged in Italy and Germany during the global economic instability of the 1920s, and consolidated power during the Great Depression of the 1930s. In Germany, resentment of the Treaty of Versailles  specifically article 231 (the "Guilt Clause") , the belief in the Dolchstosslegende, and the onset of the Great Depression fueled the rise to power of the militarist National Socialist German Workers Party (the Nazi party) of which Adolf Hitler was the leader. Meanwhile, the Treaty's provisions were laxly enforced from fear of another war. Closely related is the failure of the UK and French policy of appeasement, which sought to avoid or postpone another war but actually encouraged Hitler to become bolder. The Soviet Union's signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact freed Germany of fear of reprisal from the Soviet Union when Germany invaded Poland. The League of Nations, despite its efforts to prevent the war, relied on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions and was unable to prevent the start of The Second World War.|`|cd3561511b453a060d3163c3d2c11ff4aa	absolutely - Germany was disatified with the Versailles treaty and was in serious economic trouble because of it.  Their country was completely down and out and inflation was insanely high.  At this point, anybody with charisma could come on the scene and lead the people - It was a very easy time to be a powerful leader and have a massive following.  At the same time, relations between most of the other European nations were still testy.  Nobody was completely satisfied with the Versialles treaty, and France was still especially uneasy.  When Germany began to be powerful under Hitler, many thought it was a great new begining.  Actually, in a  lot of places, including America, that time was called the German Renaissance, a name that of course died out after the world learned about what Hitler was REALLY doing to his own people and the people of other neighboring countries.  Hitler needed to continue on his reputation of being a strong leader (and his campaign promises) by conquering more land for Germany, which inevitably brought on WWII.|`|b4471c0dc1a0b131f920d608f2ade38aaa	It could have been avoided.

And I would worry about what might be on your friends pages, which you can't control except to not have them as friends.     All this is fuzzy, and goes to your judgment. You will get some leeway for being a HS Senior, but some is taken away by virtue of schools being choosy, and having about 100x applicants as spaces. You are competing with the others, for better or worse.    And I would surely drop the part about going to Nebraska if that is not decided already.     I like the part about wanting to be a doctor.     I am not sure about the Ferris Bueller quote although it is a personal favorite - might or might not show the kind of attitude that will do well at each school.    Be sure to google your name hard, and don't forget yahoo and msn because sometimes other stuff will show up.    But do be yourself.

The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox. We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out ahead of us. We see the same things each day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.    And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.  -XKCD
069a91495e9103e06deb265a5edf5c4caa	There are two kinds of college credit - semester credits and quarter credits, depending whether the college is on the semester system (2 semesters per school year) or the quarter system (3 quarters per school year).    Most colleges are on the semester system. One credit hour is granted for attending a one-hour class once a week for approximately 50 minutes. A one-hour credit for lab would represent approximately 2.5 hours in lab per week.    Thus, a three-hour credit is granted for successfully completing a course that meets for three periods per week - approximately 2.5 total hours.|`|AA10074302	Approximately 15 hours of class time is equal to one college credit, in addition, you need to spend additional time studying the material.

inZ9CWBiaa	So, I think that the question is - how can you get the parents of these students more involved with their learning at home so that they get the help they need?  I don't know if you can. I have students who struggle with reading and writing and I would love for them to get support at home, but unfortunately their main caregiver is illiterate. Some families have other difficulties - work, illness in the family, large number of children or drugs, etc that keep them from providing the support that their child needs.   If you find that this is the problem, I would consider increasing the amount of in-school intervention you supply. We can't always control what happens outside the school gates, but we can control their experiences in our classroom.  If you don't think that this is the issue, I would consider having workshops with the parents concerned to teach them games and skills that will help their children and support what you are doing. I have had parents try to teach "sounding it out" as the main strategy and you wind up with the poor kids saying w-o-u-l-d - with no chance of actually figuring out the word! Keep what you send home light and fun - these are kids who are likely turned off school, so sending home lots of school-type work might backfire.   Hope this helps.

jV3C8vF4aa	im not reading all of that|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	My cousin was like that in the 5-7 grades. She just had to put her 2 cents into every friggin thing. She drove us all crazy doing that. Saying our clothes don't match, our hair is too dark for the lipstick we chose, hair part was uneven, anything she could think of. She also corrected us like it was going out of style. Finally we just quit responding to it and when she did it, we still included her in all the games we played and let her have her opinion, just figuring that eventually she would either grow out of it or be told it was rude by someone else and feel embarrassed. We were right. She slowed down on it a bit when she left the elementary school and wasn't the top dog anymore. She did start back up for awhile once she realized she was the underdog again in 7th grade, but now that she's a sophmore in high school she doesn't do that. I think it's just something they grow into and back out of after awhile. I think she just felt like she was growing up and her opinion needed to matter when she was at the top of the chain in her school (the highest grade there was 6th) and then maybe felt small and like she needed to make her point  to be known by again in junior high. There's nothing wrong with letting them know it bothered you, but I can tell you that you certainly can't change their personalities and it would be wrong to try. It's not a personality, it is a part of growing up.    EDIT: In junior high school it's what some girls do to be popular. A lot of young girls will try to copy the behavior awhile before they get to that grade and it sounds like those girls were just practicing. My cousin used to call herself a "teen in training" and oh good lord was that an annoying time in her life, lol.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	You can't change their personalities and shouldn't try to.  But rudeness is not a personality issue.  Respect for others has to be taught.  If they have been rude and disrespectful towards others, it was only a matter of time before they turned it onto you.    I wouldn't ignore them.  They probably won't get it.    I would tell them that you were hurt by their mean words and that they ought to apologize.  If they don't apologize, then I would pay less attention to them for a while so that they learn that a price is to be paid for that kind of behavior.  If they do apologize, I would probably intentionally spend some time, every so often, discussing proper social behavior and the idea that "what goes around comes around"--be mean to others and meanness will come back to get you.    Don't take their behavior personally, since they do it to everyone.  But don't just put up with it.  Act like the grown up and let them know what is acceptable behavior and what isn't, and what the consequences of inappropriate behavior can be.    But remember that it may take years to sink in.  They've got to get past those nasty middle school years first...|`|CbzP5Yegaa	Smack them.|`|xgZE6RvNaa	ignore them. kids are mean at that age - i should know. i was the geek they picked on :D    just dont pay too much attention. if other people said you looked good, take their opinions over some eleven-year olds

Forms of IT are computer hard drives, floppy disks and rolodexes (the original technology!).  IT software can be Microsoft Access, Excel or even your operating system (it stores your file information).  Careers in IT can be data architect (someone who builds storage units and categorizes them for a business), IT technician (someone who repairs the hardware) or IT Analyst (someone who breaks down the information and then assembles it in a report).   That's how I'd explain it to a 12th grader.  good luck

87aR0FpRaa	Fortifications are military constructions and buildings designed for defense in warfare. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin fortis ("strong") and facere ("to make").    Many military installations are known as forts, although they are not always fortified. Larger forts may class as fortresses, smaller ones formerly often bore the name of fortalices. The word fortification can also refer to the practice of improving an area's defense with defensive works. City walls are fortifications but not necessarily called fortresses.    The art of laying out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally classes as castrametation, since the time of the Roman legions. The art/science of laying siege to a fortification and of destroying it has the popular name of siegecraft and the formal name of poliorcetics. In some texts this latter term also applies to the art of building a fortification.    Fortification is usually divided into two branches, namely permanent fortification and field fortification. Permanent fortifications are erected at leisure, with all the resources that a state can supply of constructive and mechanical skill, and are built of enduring materials. Field fortifications are extemporized by troops in the field, perhaps assisted by such local labor and tools as may be procurable and with materials that do not require much preparation, such as earth, brushwood and light timber. There is also an intermediate branch known as semipermanent fortification. This is employed when in the course of a campaign it becomes desirable to protect some locality with the best imitation of permanent defences that can be made in a short time, ample resources and skilled civilian labor being available.    Medieval-style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of cannons on the 14th century battlefield. Fortifications in the age of blackpowder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so were sunk into ditches fronted by earth slopes.       Bourtange star fort, restored to 1750 situation, Groningen (province), NetherlandsThis placed a heavy emphasis on the geometry of the fortification to allow defensive cannonry interlocking fields of fire to cover all approaches to the lower and thus more vulnerable walls. Fortifications also extended in depth, with protected batteries for defensive cannonry, to allow them to engage attacking cannon to keep them at a distance and prevent them bearing directly on the vulnerable walls. The result was star shaped fortifications with tier upon tier of hornworks and bastions, of which Bourtange illustrated to the left is an excellent example. There are also extensive fortifications from this era in the Nordic states and in Britain, the fortifications of Berwick on Tweed being a fine example.    The arrival of explosive shells in the nineteenth century led to yet another stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts of the cannon era did not fare well against the effects of high explosive and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells. Worse, the large open ditches surrounding forts of this type were an integral part of the defensive scheme, as was the covered way at the edge of the counter scarp. The ditch was extremely vulnerable to bombardment with explosive shells.    In response, military engineers evolved the polygonal style of fortification. The ditch became deep and vertically sided, cut directly into the native rock or soil, laid out as a series of straight lines creating the central fortified area that gives this style of fortification its name.    Wide enough to be an impassable barrier for attacking troops, but narrow enough to be a difficult target for enemy shellfire, the ditch was swept by fire from defensive blockhouses set in the ditch as well as firing positions cut into the outer face of the ditch itself.    The profile of the fort became very low indeed, surrounded outside the ditch by a gently sloping open area so as to eliminate possible cover for enemy forces, while the fort itself provided a minimal target for enemy fire. The entrypoint became a sunken gatehouse in the inner face of the ditch, reached by a curving ramp that gave access to the gate via a rolling bridge that could be withdrawn into the gatehouse.    Much of the fort moved underground, with deep passages to connect the blockhouses and firing points in the ditch to the fort proper, with magazines and machine rooms deep under the surface.    The guns however, were often mounted in open emplacements and protected only by a parapet - both in order to keep a lower profile and also because experience with guns in closed casemates had seen them put out of action by rubble as their own casemates were collapsed around them.    Steel-and-concrete fortifications were common during the 19th and early 20th centuries, however the advances in modern warfare since World War I have made large-scale fortifications obsolete in most situations. Only underground bunkers are still able to provide some protection in modern wars. Many historical fortifications were demolished during the modern age, but a considerable number survive as popular tourist destinations and prominent local landmarks today.    The downfall of permanent fortifications had three causes. The ever escalating power of artillery and air power meant that almost any target that could be located could be destroyed, if sufficient force was massed against it. As such, the more resources a defender devoted to

Did you work and earn any money in 2008?  This is not a hard question....  lol.  Do you have any cash?  Money in the bank?  Cash stashed under a mattress?

AXiKJDV9aa	Law school is a graduate school so you need to do undergrad first.  A 3.6 GPA will not cut it at Stanford for undergrad, you need to get close to a 4 GPA if you want to go there.    My advice for what its worth is broaden your horizons.  IMHO Cal-tech and Harvey Mudd are at least as good as Stanford and easier to get into (you still need to be good though):  http://www.caltech.edu/  http://www.hmc.edu/    I especially like Harvey Mudd since they have close to the highest admission rate to graduate school of any college in the US, even better than Stanford, MIT and Cal-tech.  And pure math\philosophy is an excellent preparation for law school.  That is not to slight Cal-tech, but for what you want to do I have a slight preference for Harvey Mudd.  BTW a combined math\computer science major (the combined math CS degree art Harvey Mudd would be ideal) and a law school degree will look great at the FBI - it is one of their in demand areas:  http://www.fbijobs.gov/1112.asp    Thanks  Bill

Or maybe a history column about the school, a fashion column, advice column, student/star of the week/month, interview teachers and kids that go to the school, and write about upcoming field trips or cover the events of a game. Those would be fun things to write about in the school magazine and the kids would probably be interested in it. If you want kids to read it, maybe have it where anyone in the school can submit something (even something like highlights does like "our own pages" for the younger kids). They will all be excited that they are a part of it. They're more likely to read it if they are a part of it, or if their friends are. Our school newspaper when I was in 6th grade didn't go very well because it was too exclusive.

AA11840302	the purchase price of the bond is  $1,089.04  you get this by discounting the bond at 4%, ie     (60/1.04) + (60/1.04^2) + (60/1.04^3) + (60/1.04^4) + (1060/1.04^5)    the sale price of the bond is $1,111.51 you git this by discounding the bond at 3% for 4 years  (60/1.03) + (60/1.03^2) + (60/1.03^3) + (1060/1.03^4)      so the profit is    $1,111.51 -  $1,089.04  =  $22.48  add coupon of  $60.00    $82.48   the return is  $82.48 / $1,089.04  *100 =  7.57%

QU37MZi7aa	i was a full time scholar student in the University where i studied and at the same time, a private sponsored scholarship student from international scholarship sponsors, so my parents did not have support for my financial needs. aside from that, i had a part time job also to pay some miscellaneous/school activities.  *you may try to ask some info on schools where you are going to enter if they have some kind of scholarships being offered to students who cannot afford to pay their tuition and have high grades earned in previous school/years.|`|e70e1a36b896563ed512520d37a29381aa	No, I got scholarship to pay my college. I got it because some friends of mine in college told me that they got valuable information regarding scholarships from this place.   Good luck
bCi8BCBBaa	I think there they are like other kids - a mix.   I don't stereotype them...good or bad.  Some are ahead of their peers academically, some aren't.  Some take part in a lot of outside activities, some not so many, (but few are isolated). Some are religious, some aren't. Some are shy, some are outgoing.  I've heard some people say home schooled kids have better social skills than their schooled peers, but that hasn't been my experience.  I've met homeschooled and schooled kids with very good and very poor social skills.  Home schooled children may be more comfortable with people of all ages, but I've met some who will speak with a much older person as if they were their peer, without understanding that 17 years of life experience doesn't compare to 45, working and raising kids.  And I've met schooled kids who are downright impolite.  All in all, I'd say they are people with weaknesses and strengths like all of us.  The only thing I could  say negatively is that a few seem to congratulate themselves for being homeschooled,  or they want to go on about their every accomplishment.  That can sound conceited.  But then again, I some some schooled kids who congratulate themselves for going to this or that "exclusive" private school or that "high ranking" public school.  Positively, I'd have to say most home schooled kids are independent, inquisitive and interesting. So I'd have to say it's a wash.|`|GVasmrYdaa	I think it's good for children or adults who have severe medical problems and homeschooling would be the best way for them to continue with their education. But for those who are capable of going to school, that would be the best, I guess, since we also learn by interacting with different kinds of people.|`|ZAO5isZTaa	some are scary religious people that have 9 brothers and sisters...  some are hella smart and cool individuals.

Our home school group has about 40 kids that are my kids age and we keep them very active. Plus academically they are two years ahead of their public school friends and get their work done in a third of the time, plus they get to do school in their jammies. lol  Home school is great, only morons who rely on the stereotypes that the media puts out there think its a bad thing.|`|AA10817491	I'm homeschooled and i'm awesome.  enough said.  it allows us to be our selfs and not be pressured into what is "in"  I'm drug free have a job own a car that i paid for myself. i'm only 17  we do pretty good if we want to.|`|4tIZJbNLaa	I'm not one to stereotype, but here's the thing. I have met A LOT of homeschooled kids in my life. All of them without exception have had an underlying sense of selfishness, reclusiveness, and an overall aura of douche baggery. They lack essential social skills required for so many important things such as getting a job or getting laid. Private school kids tend to have more social skills but a heightened sense of douche baggery, even flirting with the category of chotch baggery. Do yourself a favor and send your kids to public school. They will come out as fine, normal, state-funded-and-educated individuals.|`|MuKNUlSraa	I believe that they learn alot, since they are more focused on wehat they are sttudyng, and do not waste time if meaningless projects that somethimes teachers assign, such as (make a skeleton out of anymaterial that you wish for one month) and thus creating stress in the student's life. however i believe that these kids miss out on the whole social scene of school, the clubs and the sports and the opportunity to establish relationships that are so essential in life.   In my opinion, I do not recommend home-schooling.|`|r18PoGJiaa	To give you my honest opinion.  I work with both home school kids and public school kids.  I do see a difference.  Home school kids are more polite to me and have manners. They are direct with you and tend to be on the quiet side.  Public school kids are loud, ill mannered (boy are they), rude and inconsiderate. Some to the point, where I don't want to be around them.  I am not stereotyping. I am speaking from experience working with both home school children and public school children.|`|L4eoLmvJaa	some good, some not so good|`|16BAkagYaa	its terrible, the kids always turn out shy and inexperienced for life. Ive met many homeschooled kids and i feel that they have missed out on so much of normal life! Interactions with others and freedom. I personally think that parents do it just because they cant let go of their children, if you want them to get a great education put them in private school|`|AA11276208	I'm homeschooled... so I guess I love my self hehe.  But really, all my closest friends are homeschooled.  I'm not shy I'm naturally quiet.  I was when I went to public school so you can't blame it on my schooling. and I don't think I have ever met a quiet homeschooler...    I love homeschooled kids.  We are awesome.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I think homeschooling is wonderful. These days, public school cannot provide the individual attention that kids deserve because the classrooms are so overpopulated. My nephew had 30 kids in his 3rd grade class and many of them didn't even speak english which puts a huge burden on the teacher because she had to work with the non english speaking kids as well as stay up to the level of teaching on the normal level. She would have to make everything more simple because there were children trying to learn the language and trying to learn the material at the same time....the material became too easy for the other kids so they got bored and got into tons of trouble. It was a terrible situation for all of the children. I don't know where you live but the public schools in my area should really be taking better consideration and care into getting these kids an education. Kids that don't know english  need more attention and spanish speaking teachers so they can catch up rather than putting them into a room that everyone speaks english. I think home school is wonderful because teachers have so much on their plates these days.    Also when a parent teaches the child, the child not only respects that parent as their care giver and provider, they respect them as an instructor as well. I have heard wonderful things about homeschooling and if you have got the skill and patience...go for it. That is another issue there are so many impatient and immature teachers today.|`|1kZenfZzaa	I think it should be totally up to the parents on how they want their children schooled.|`|MwrRCxKGaa	Home Schooled kids are Freaks, j/k I was home Schooled. no i do agree that i feel like i have missed out on a big part of public school.

FyPKXjEFaa	Well sure, newspapers are becoming obsolete but online newspapers aren't. People are going online instead of buying papers so there are still people writing the articles, they're just being published in a different forum.

p3JGYWrBaa	I go to University at Buffalo and I love my school. Its has 2 big campuses, actually in 2010 they are going to renew the whole campus and build new departments. Area is not bad, its a college city. There are 3-4 more colleges that 10-15 min to UB.   Campus apartments great I think. its around 550/mo everything is included. You dont need a car if you live in campus. There are school buses that runs till 2am. Libraries are open 24/7, I seen people sleeping there :)   Around 30 thousand students, and UB is the most international sunny school in new york state. If you have specific questions you can ask. I just wrote whatever came to my mind.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	This was my second choice school. I liked it a lot. The campus was really big, but everyone seemed pretty friendly. Campus spirit was high without being totally in your face. There are a lot of international students. The food selection was nice as well. Since it's a state school, the tuition was cheap, even for out of state (only like $2K more than my in state tuition). There are a lot of different majors there, which is good if you're still undecided with what you want to do. There are a lot of opportunities for students to be involved with everything, from campus spirit to volunteer opportunities to undergraduate research.

rlKZ40fZaa	Hi:    Yes, you do place a comma before 'too' and after it if it comes in the middle of the sentence.    I, too, would like some help, please.    I would like some help with this, too.      Why do you place commas around this word?    The rule is that you place commas around parenthetical information/expressions. Parenthetical information is words which are not essential to the meaning of the sentence. That is, they can be omitted and the sentence still makes sense and conveys the same message.    Using the sentences from above, I have omitted the words 'too' in the sentences below to show you that they are parenthetical expression, which, when omitted, do not effect the sentence's essential meaning.    I would like some help, please.    I would like some help with this.      This is the same for the following sentence:    I went and saw the funniest movie, which was nominated for awards, but I had a car crash on the way home from the movie.    In this sentence, commas are placed around the relative clause 'which was nominated for awards' because it is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.    However, writers today are leaning towards using fewer commas. Thus you may see many grammar experts arguing that the comma is optional with the word 'too.' Therefore, the commas can be left out if you wish to reduce the pause before and after saying it, and if you wish to increase fluency.      If you would like further help with comma rules or parenthetical information, you can email me.|`|eRKIfrVfaa	no you put commas on a list or during a pause|`|f3SyOyMEaa	No|`|tMK9abumaa	Yes.

lrqZHi9Jaa	Another angle to look at it from    What purpose do guns serve in the community?    My own view, none...they have one use and one use only ...to take life and I dont view that as sport.    Eradicating them altogether wont work - there will always be a black market for them and whilst crime rates may stay high remember its easier to kill someone or something from a bigger distance with a gun than a knife.    If people want to kill they will use other things...remember in olden days there were arrows and tomahawks...even bare hands. There will always be something people will use if they really want to harm someone else.    Sad but thats the society we live in.  I live in Australia and a few years ago our government funded a buy back on firearms.  Lots were turned in but I wondered if the money they were paid went on getting a better gun than the one they had.  Also how many didnt get turned in?  My guess is too many to count.    Tighter controls wont work either.  You are supposed to register your gun when you buy it...and we all can see how that works.

nWVf3sUvaa	Centrifugal force is a term that refers to two different forces which are related to rotation. Both of them are oriented away from the axis of rotation, but the object on which they are exerted differs.     Basically centrifugal force is a circular force that pushes away bodies from the center of the rotation. A good example of centrifugal force is when you're riding a car. When a car turns around a sharp curve, the passengers seem to be pushed away from the curve.    Centripetal force is the other way around, instead of pushing the other body away from the axis of rotation, it moves closer and closer.|`|w2xsd28Qaa	if you are holding a bucket of water, and you spin it around, then let it go, it is the force that makes the bucket fly straight out instead of following the path around the circle.  it is always in a direction tangent to the circle that the object is moving in, meaning it will always want to go straight out if released.|`|f60cd7b117ff27288889fc97dde3c7f8aa	centrifugal force is the force that acts on an object when spun. It is a result of the constant inertia of the object pushing it outwards, but due to a connection to the axis, it is impeded.|`|e529431b39e47bbba5f64347dcbb5384aa	Centrifugal force (from Latin centrum "center" and fugere "to flee") is a term which may refer to two different forces which are related to rotation. Both of them are oriented away from the axis of rotation, but the object on which they are exerted differs.    A real or "reactive" centrifugal force occurs in reaction to a centripetal acceleration acting on a mass. This centrifugal force is equal in magnitude to the centripetal force, directed away from the center of rotation, and is exerted by the rotating object upon the object which imposes the centripetal acceleration. Although this sense was used by Isaac Newton,[1] it is only occasionally used in modern discussions.[2][3][4][5]   A pseudo or "fictitious" centrifugal force appears when a rotating reference frame is used for analysis. The (true) frame acceleration is substituted by a (fictitious) centrifugal force that is exerted on all objects, and directed away from the axis of rotation.

Both of them are oriented away from the axis of rotation, but the object on which they are exerted differs.    A real or "reactive" centrifugal force occurs in reaction to a centripetal acceleration acting on a mass. This centrifugal force is equal in magnitude to the centripetal force, directed away from the center of rotation, and is exerted by the rotating object upon the object which imposes the centripetal acceleration. Although this sense was used by Isaac Newton,[1] it is only occasionally used in modern discussions.[2][3][4][5]   A pseudo or "fictitious" centrifugal force appears when a rotating reference frame is used for analysis. The (true) frame acceleration is substituted by a (fictitious) centrifugal force that is exerted on all objects, and directed away from the axis of rotation.   Both of the above can be easily observed in action for a passenger riding in a car. If a car swerves around a corner, a passenger's body seems to move towards the outer edge of the car and then pushes against the door.    In the reference frame that is rotating together with the car (a model which those inside the car will often find natural), it looks as if a force is pushing the passenger away from the center of the bend. This is a fictitious force--not an actual force exerted by some other object. The illusion occurs when the reference frame is the car, because that ignores the car's acceleration. A number of physicists treat it much as if it were a real force, as they find that it makes calculations simpler and gives correct results.    However, the force with which the passenger pushes against the door is very real. That force is called a reaction force because it results from passive interaction with the car which actively pushes against the body. As it is directed outward, it is a centrifugal force. Note that this real centrifugal force does not appear until the person touches the body of the car. The car also exerts an equal but opposite force on the person, called "centripetal force". In this case the centrifugal force is canceled by the centripetal force, and the net force is zero, thus the person does not accelerate with respect to the car.      The centripetal force is the external force required to make a body follow a circular path at constant speed. The force is directed inward, toward the center of the circle. Hence it is a force requirement, not a particular kind of force. Any force (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc.) can act as a centripetal force. The term centripetal force comes from the Latin words centrum ("center") and petere ("tend towards").    The centripetal force always acts perpendicular to the direction of motion of the body. In the case of an object that moves along a circular arc with a changing speed, the net force on the body may be decomposed into a perpendicular component that changes the direction of motion (the centripetal force), and a parallel, or tangential component, that changes the speed.

e743ed532df005041a1b8cf658cd829baa	Personally, I've been at Seneca, dropped out, and now I'm at Humber.   When I was at Seneca, it was horrible. You did part of your course online, part - in class, you had like 5 accounts which you had to constantly check and use, and in the summer semester, our instructors changed IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEMESTER. In other words, it was horrible.  Humber, on the other hand, is well organized and employees, in my opinion, very good teachers.  As for Brown, I'm not sure.  CDI is a private college, but that's all I can tell you.    Humber, however, received the best rating by the ontario gov't (i think its called, KPI, i'm not sure).

5a3cc1c5e538a2d4cc9ba5bf89099a2aaa	Well, conformity is the uniform acts of a group. Anti-conformity would be people acting normally, not thinking as a group but acting for their own. The best example is high school, there is always the groups made up of like individuals, they are conforming to one idea, they are all the same. Then there are the people that show up in their Slayer t-shirt with purple shorts and dont care what everyone else is doing, they are doing their own thing. That person is an non-conformist. This does show up after high school, you'd be surprised. I've seen it at jobs in corporate america, there are always people who can't think on their own and just like to get together and start little groups.  Conformity is the playground for the unimaginative|`|OHy9fCw4aa	It's not an oxymoron. An oxymoron 'is' a combination of two contradictory words but anti conformity doesn't qualify as such. It would be something like 'hot water heater' or 'resident alien.' Anti conformity is basically going against the social grain.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	It is an oxy-moron.  Anti-conformity mean that you are going against the grain and not doing what everyone else is doing, wearing, listening too.....just because it is what society says is popular.  Though you are conforming to the anti-conformists so it pretty much backfires.

hTwZBiicaa	1. Pay all of your debt, every month, ON TIME.   Don't add to any of your credit card balances - in fact, put all of your credit cards on ice (literally - stick them in the fridge or freezer and not in your wallet/purse, that way you are not tempted to use them but still have them available for true emergencies).  Get all of your balances down below half of your credit limits.  Paying ontime for just three months will begin to boost your credit score incrementally, the longer you pay on time, the better your score will be.    2. Get a copy of all of your credit reports.  You are legally entitled to one free copy every year.  When you get your free copies, you will have the option to purchase your "credit score" - usually costs about $5.  Do that for one of the credit reports, so you know your credit score.    3.  Look over your credit reports very, very carefully, and be sure to print out copies for yourself.  If anything is wrong, request an investigation - you can do this online at the same time and place you are getting your free credit reports.  If nothing is wrong, good.  If something is wrong - and there usually is one or two errors - start an investigation.  Within a month, the results of the investigation will be emailed and snail mailed to you.  Anything wrong will be corrected or deleted, anything verified will remain.  The wrong items deleted will give a small - I repeat, SMALL - boost to your credit score.      4.  Do not get any new credit at this point in time, and do not apply for any new credit.  Applying for new credit results in an "inquiry" which can make a small dent in your credit score.    If you do the above, within a few months you will begin to see a small improvement in your credit score, which will improve over time with greater speed.  Within a year, your rating should improve enough to boost your score into the range where you can get credit again, do this for 2-1/2 to three years, and you should have a stellar rating.  Be sure to ALWAYS get copies of your credit report once a year and be on the watch for new problems.|`|DfWiIXRtaa	DER! pay off your debt. then you will have a betta sco yo!|`|HhDXT5ynaa	you can get your credit score many different ways just contact experian and they can help you. if you go through a company then make sure they dont sign you up for a membership and charge you monthly.     now to raise your score... make sure that all of your payments are on time- VERY important and make sure that your credit cards aren't at their limit (try to keep them below 50% of your limit- so you have charged $450 with a limit of $1000)  if you do those two things your score will go wayyyy up

J0bqxozSaa	Ok, for one you have to know that this is all obviously written by someone who is a shi'ite as it is all about Ali! A shi'ite is one of the two main sectors of Islam. Shi'ites mostly believe that the angel gabriel did a mistake by taking the message of God to Mohammed instead of Ali. Also it is a poem written about ali.     In the first picture you see a face drawn with swords crossing under it. The intersection of these swords has the word "Allah" there. To the right of the face it says "No son, except for Ali," which means there is no guy like ali. TO the left of the face, it says "NO sword except for that of (al-faqar)- which means there is no weapon like that of the sword of ali (which is called al-faqar because of its shape)" Under the swords it says: "This is the son of Fatima if you did not know who he was. this is the son of "Al-bat-ha'a" and he ate and he welcomed." it then says something that does not make sense to me but it is transcribed as "Ma Fal, La qat, Fee (in) mash-hida (the way he looked) al-shahada (the act of saying - i witness that there is no god but allah and i witness that  mohammed is the prophet of god -) kanat (was)  li'ah. na'am (yes)" i transcribed everything and i put the translations of the words i knew next to it.     as for the second photo:     again this does not make a lot of sense but it says "kafa (enough) bik (by you) a'afak (left you alone) khaleek (left you)."     as for the third photo:     it says "Lo God, Lo Mohammed, Lo Ali, a memory (this word is written when someone in arabic wants to write a message like for instance Mike was here on a table - you write the word memory in arabic) then the guy writes his name, which is : abdulkafi najim abdulyassir, which definately is not a kuwaiti name.     :)|`|AA10890912	i could not understand but the third one   because the font was too fade or in other words the words were not clear     anyway the thierd one says   O'god O'mohammad O'Ali and the rest is someones name     i think these were  some old drawings in someplace of shia' Muslims     i hope that helped

The school will help you with practically everything from writting resumes to how to dress. They offer you with numerous chances to attend their networking galas where you will have a chance to meet the top companies in the business world. Besides Bentley is much better known for business majors. In addition, the bentley alumni provide bentley kids with priority to work at their offices which are mostly successful.|`|B9cE2hjUaa	I'm pretty sure GW has a higher employment rate than Bentley.

En realidad segn la Real Academia de la Lengua es correcto escribirlo de las 2 maneras, es simple conversin en cada pas, por ejemplo: en Mxico decimos Alemania, En Estados Unidos: Germany, pero los Alemanes conocen a su pas como Deutschland.    Es solo que en cada pas vara la forma de hablar y como tu dices, cada pas la escribe como puede, pero en Mxico por una u otra razn tenemos la tendencia (algunas personas) a insultar por errores como estos.

128b03f5cbdd1dfaf8b251c808f25c2baa	Both the Oedipus and the Electra Complex get their names from the characters of greek mythology: Electra and Oedipus.   Shortly:  Oedipus (in the myth) is abandoned by his true parents because a fortuneteller tells them he will grow up, kill his father (the king) and marry his mother. He grows up in another kingdom and learns about his bad fortune and leaves his kingdom; only he does not know he has been adopted. On his way (not knowing ofcourse) he accidentally kills his biological father and comes to a city where he saves the citizens from the sphynx. As the new king he marries the old king's wife, which is actually no one but her mother. Freud explains his Oedipus complex as: at about the age of three a child discovers his sexual identity and the mother being the opposite sex to the child, has a kind of affection towards his mother. His mother and father being married, the little boy may feel jealous and may act kinda hostile to the father.     Electra is the other way around. In again the greek mythology; Electra's mother cheats on Agamemnon, Electra's father and when he returns from war E's mom and lover kill him. Electra finds out about this and has a strong agression towards her mother and raises her brother to kill their mother.   So the Electra complex is the love for the father and the hostility to the mother.   This is sometimes related to hamlet's situation in Hamlet the play.|`|AQJCFjwGaa	The Electra complex was created as the female counterpart to the Oedipus complex in males. Its name comes from the Greek myth of Electra, who wanted her brother to avenge their father Agamemnon's death by killing their mother Clytemnestra.    Carl Jung proposed the name Electra complex for Sigmund Freud's concept of the "feminine Oedipus attitude" in young girls.[2] According to Sigmund Freud, the girl is originally attached to the mother as well; however, when she discovers that she lacks a penis during the phallic stage the daughter becomes libidinally attached to her father and imagines that she will become pregnant by him, while becoming more hostile towards her mother. This is due mostly to the idea of "penis envy" - that the girl is envious of her father's penis. She believes that the pregnancy would replace the missing penis which she envies and would allow her to gain equal status with the father.

Since you went through the exam once and are more or less aware of BRS phys, you should focus more on BRS path (read it through twice and go through their questions). Whatever is not in First Aid from those books, add to First Aid. The week two weeks before the exam, you listen to Goljan and try to get through First Aid as a review. Throughout all this do a 50q Kaplan block each day and go over it. yes, it will be a tough 2 months, but I feel that it will AT LEAST get you to pass.|`|9H8TW9f2aa	where is your leader ?

He sat alone for hours on end,  Conversing with his only friend  And found delight within the fact  That he controlled it's every act.  He told it how he never had  A chance, since all his luck was bad  Although he'd tried so to succeed -  The dummy nodded and agreed.    And how his journeys in romance  Had never given him a chance,  And wasn't it a crying shame  That he was always held to blame  When everyone knew, oh so well,  That life is but a living Hell,  Controlled by lust and power and greed?  The dummy nodded and agreed.    With patience that would rival saints,  That dummy sat through all complaints  And, with each little expert tug,  He'd droop his head or bow or shrug  And give some comfort to the man  Who held his lifelines in his hand  And helped to fill a lonely need  When he just nodded and agreed.    Senility increased with time  As did the old man's phantomime,  And feverish fingers pulled with glee  The dummy's dance of misery.  They never left each other's side  Until the day both stopped and died.  We found them lying, hand in hand,  The dummy - and his wooden friend.

KQJPWWjeaa	I work for Head Start.  With increased costs of transportation and supplies, there is a need for increased funding.  Yes, the parents can do most of the work at home, but the Early Intervention services provided by Head Start is where more money is needed.  There are not enough EI teachers available in the program.  Perhaps more funding for that area would allow for more staffing.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	NO. I taught @ Head Start. The long-lasting benefits of universal preK just are not there. The money could be  better spent adding an assistant to every K-grade 2 classroom across the US.  Early Head Start cost @ our program $10,000 PER child a year. And, when I took the family info mom usually made about $14,000 a year. That is NOT cost-effective.  Are there cost-effective alternatives?   1) Yes, Even Start where parent gets training, helps in the classroom, and attends parenting workshops. The kids later down the road have better skills than those Head Start kids. Parents are empowered.  2) Maternity leave for moms. Would this make more sense than paying over $10,000 a year in taxes so a mom can work for $14,000? Could she work part-time, share babysitting with a friend, and make the same $4000 plus maternity benefits?  3) A new study show 9 month old chimps are smarter than most 9 month old babies here in the USA. The study suggests a lack of parenting skills cause the decline. Could our pushing babies into child care actually are harming our children?  4) what about options for parents who do not want institutional child care, yet lack financial resources to explore alternatives.|`|PnCGvGmxaa	Definitely not!

Children who take occupational therapy have trouble with a number of issues that don't affect their intelligence. Normally, they have fine motor issues that have to do with the ability to transmit what is seen to writing on a piece of paper.     If your brother is receiving these services, then it has nothing whatever to do with his brain and everything to do with the wiring between his brain, his eyes and his hands. Just as we would not consider a person who wears glasses as unintelligent, the same holds true for occupational therapy, which is the way to help kids with writing and a few other issues.

Ok.  That's a personal favorite topic that I wish more people would explore.  How about:  --Importance of parent education with ASD  --Getting diagnosis for ASD at an earlier age  --More teacher training for people with ASD (or even special needs in general)    I think the 3rd one strikes a chord with me as well.    Hope that helps a brainstorming session for you.|`|GBKaftrJaa	I'd go with why kids with autism do not belong in a special ed classroom because they adapt to the behaviors of those around them. So for them to learn to fit into society they have to be exposed to society and not put with other kids with behavioral problems.|`|i7o3bsLqaa	How about "Special education students should be mainstreamed (included) into the general education environment in order to be most successful"  or "Special education students are most successful in an inclusive (only special ed students in the room) environment"...depending on your opinion of course!    I am a Special Ed teacher...and this is an ongoing argument in my school :-)
Gsqt4ODYaa	heat of formation is the heat absorbed when you make something.  Its the heat you need, to form something.    enthalpy is a measure of heat, relating to internal energy and such, we had a lot of equations for this in thermodynamics, depending on if its a gas, or if the substance is flowing through a system, etc.  Short answer, it's a measure of energy relating to temperature, kind of.    Specific enthalphy = specific internal energy + pressure * specific volume.  Total enthalphy = internal energy + pressure * volume  we had to use ethalphy when we were using the 2nd law of thermodynamics, dealing with turbines, and compressors, and systems.    Heat of combustion - it's the heat given off when something combusts.  When something combusts, or reacts with oxygen ( explosions ) it gives off heat.  That heat is the ehat of combustion.      Hess's law I don't remember using, but here it is  -The overall enthalpy change in a reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes of the individual steps of the process.-**    so basically, I think with the homework you are doing, they want you to calculate a reaction, probably breaking carbon - hydrogen bonds when you are reacting it with oxygen, which will change release energy.    so like, C_2 H_6 +3.5* O_2 =>2* C O_2 +3* H_2 O    You are breaking carbon hydrogen bonds, and oxygen oxygen bonds, and then creating carbon oxygen  bonds and oxygen hydrogen bonds, so you'll use hess's law which adds up the energy given off from each individual bond, and calculate the heat of combustion.    I hope that helped
SIhxrxD3aa	Many grad programs will look heavily at your GPA and they won't even look at your application if you don't meet the minimum.  However, if you have other qualifications you could bring to a grad program like previous research experience or job experience related to the program, then a less selective school would at least consider you with the minimum.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Most grad schools require at least a 3.0 GPA, but plenty don't as well eg:  http://www.regis.edu/spscatalog.asp?page...    It will hold you back from prestigious programs - but not from actually getting a Masters - which in today's job market I strongly recommend.  And if you do a Masters at a less prestigous school, and do well it will help in getting into a more prestigious programs.    Thanks  Bill|`|p3JGYWrBaa	You are not alone. Im graduating this year also with my psychology degree. I guess we all go thru this. I couldn't focus on my school work all in the beginning of my college year and now I feel like I'm paying for it! It sucks.  But I dont think you should be that optimistic. Graduate school really focus on your last 3 semesters. If you did good those semester I think you should be fine. But also I think it might not be enough to show that you are doing better. You should do internships/volunteer/research in your field. These will all give you better chance to get in. Also dont forget to mention why you had low grades in your personal statement. I think that will helps alot.|`|1HLIKuTvaa	Look more closely at admission standards.  Many well-known schools have a formula that is GPA x 2 + GMAT=>1000 (or 1100, 1200 depending on the school).  In addition, many have a caveat to the 3.0 if the upper division courses are significantly better than years 1 & 2.      Some have a 2.75 standard...  The link below is an MBA program accredited by AACSB, and one that you could get into on the west coast.

Your ADHD etc wil not be a barrier.  And you will almost certainly get in.    Thanks  Bill|`|IGSVfbGuaa	OK, raise your grades 2nd semester and senior year. YOU NEED TO DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, you have no excuse to do so, at the very most you can get your conselor to help. Find out what you want in a college, campus/majors/instate or out/etc. You have mental disabilities, and colleges do take those into consideration.    Sports/the army are unrelated, I'm sorry.    If you want a military life, talk with your parents....you can go to the military, you can go to college, or you can do both (not at the same time though).    all colleges are 4 year, and as long as it doesn't say "women's college" it is coed.    So you may be able to make it into a state-university, I don't know. Talk with your conselor, and your parents to see what you can make of the situation|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	There is hope for everyone. But I do have to say that you will have a hard time in college if all you have to do is simple research on what college you should go to, and instead rely on strangers on the internet to do this for you.     Once you're at college, there will not be anyone helping you with the actual work. So get ready now.     I hope you don't take this wrongly. I did not mean any disrespect.|`|p3JGYWrBaa	You seem confuse and its OK. Trust me, most people dont know what they are doing even in college and thats worse. For arms I think you should wait at least a year to decide on that. Maybe start a community college, increase your GPA than move on to a college that you like.   I dont know where you live to recommend you some colleges. But University at Buffalo, NY is a good college. You will get in with a 2.0 but in order to graduate you have to meet the departments requirement.

d0bJBzo6aa	First you have to think about the problem and realize what you need to replace with a variable. I would use d to represent the daughter's age now and f for the father's present age. So the first equation would be f=2d (I think that one's easy to understand). For the next sentence you would get f-10=3(d-10). Based on the first equation, you can sub in 2d to the second in place of f, which means you would get 2d-10=3d-30, and when you simplified this you would get d=20. This means the daughter is 20, and the father is twice that, or 40.   I'm not really sure what tips to give for how to do word problems, but it makes it a lot esaier to understand when the first thing you do is define your variables. The good thing about them is that even if you're not sure you did it correctly, you can almost always check your answers. And if all else fails, guess and check, and then work backwards.   Hope this helped at least a little. If it didn't, add what you still don't understand and I'll try to help more.|`|9Z50hVCmaa	so your going to need to make two equations, and have them have a common variable on both sides.  in this case...  2f ( the present time) = 3f - 10 (ten years ago)  f is the common variable we are going to use for  of year times as the difference  then solve them   f = 10    plug it in. the present time comes out to 20  ten years ago comes out to 20 also  good  this was to find the daughters age first  so the daughter is 20 in the present time b/c 2f = 20  because he was twice as old, he is fourty  on the other side,   because it was ten years ago you need to subtract 10 from his age of fourty. so he was thirty ten years ago. since he was thirty ten years ago, one third of that is 10. she was ten.    now: he is fourty she is twenty  10yrs ago: he was thirty, she was 10|`|oQLmfqVYaa	let the fathers present age be x  and the daughters present age be y    now     A father is now twice as old as his daughter  =>x=2y    10 years ago, he was 3 times as old as she was  =>(x-10)=3(y-10)    solving these eqns we get x=40,y=20    hence the father is presently 40 and the daughter is 20 .  **************************  well.....   on  how to solve these problems :  1.check for the values u dont know(fathers and daughters age here)  2.name the unknowns by variables  3.find relation between them using the given conditions     n  just be careful in cases like before ten years and after ten years u sub or add from the present age for all the related variables  (i.e dont write ur eqn like (x-10)=3y,    with reference to this problem )

AXiKJDV9aa	You will get into a college on the east coast - no problemo.  For just a sample of some of the options check out the schools education experts suggest:  http://www.ctcl.org/  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/educat...    IMHO the best thing you can do is pick about 10 schools that appeal and become acquainted with them from their web site - especially their admission requirements.  Formulate a plan to meet those requirements eg if they require 4 years foreign language plan for that, if they require calculus plan for that.  And last, but not least, drop therm a line to ensure you are on the right track.  Don't be shy - schools generally love to hear from prospective students.  Then apply your senior year knowing due to your preparation you have the inside running.    Just continue to do your best and everything will be fine.    Thanks  Bill|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Yes you.

h0ypk4Dtaa	Your grades tell more about your laziness. If you transfer because the university you are at is too hard, then you will be in trouble. To play a sport is probably a good thing. Grades and the MCAT score will get your application through the first round, but admission committees will then be looking for something that sets you apart from the other 100s of applicants. What they don't want to see, is someone who is wishy-washy and makes the easy decisions. Keep your grades up, do well on the MCAT, play sports and other hobbies, volunteer, and pick up some research this summer. Good luck!|`|vy5TCwTjaa	yes it will hurt your application very badly and you propabily will never get into medical school because it makes you look lazy.
gmaCvh00aa	I think D, but I couldn't swear to it.    It's definitely not a or b.  Education wasn't considered as necessary in the South as it is today, even amongst wealthy whites, and most of the slave states had laws against allowing blacks to learn to read, although some states, like Virginia, didn't enforce that as much.    The South was mainly rural, so I don't think the proportion of living in cities would be higher.    I tend not to think it was the murder rate, because even though black people were often killed, it wasn't considered murder because they were considered property, and the Southerners like to call each other out for duels, and if somebody got killed that wasn't exactly murder, either, since they had voluntarily put themselves in that position.    I'd say "d", partly because it looks almost like a trick question--you know, you are supposed to think "oh,  they all had black slaves", but only a small percentage were wealthy and owned slaves.
qsjGiaW2aa	When you took your PSAT, Collegeboard.com registered you and your scores into it. Colleges are getting your information and sending you emails because it seems they think your a good candidate.

AA12290185	Dodge City, Kansas  Circa 1876    LET ME RECAP WHAT HAPPENED IN PART THREE  "They've Got Matt."  Subtitle...MATT! It's me!! Your Okie. Your dokie. Your Annie Oakley"      U.S.Marshal Matt Dillon has been kidnapped by two bad guys....Pale Horse, a Shawnee and Mr. Bushwacker Country.  Matt took such a beating from them that he got temporary amnesia. They have tried to convince him that his name is "Daniel" and that he escaped from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Penitentiary For Wayward Men, along with another fellow........a fellow named "Sun," whom they chased away.   They told Matt: "You were so delirious when we found you that all you could do was say,(5) 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.' "  Apparently "Sun"was from Brokeback Mountain country....One of them pretty boy types. Matt crossed his legs and shuddered when he heard this.    Later in the evening they hear a voice in the woods: "Drop your guns and let go of Matt Dillon!! My name is SUNSHINE MACGILLICUTTY and I'm here to get my man!!"  Bushwhacker:"(4) It must be a case of mistaken identity! There ain't no one here named "Matt."  Sunshine:"I'm lookin' at him right now, you horse's ***!!"  Bushwhacker:"My name ain't Matt. This here is Pale Horse. And this cowboy is named, "Daniel."  Sunshine:"His name is Matt Dillon, NOT Daniel."  Matt looked perplexed. His head was spinning.  Matt:"Do I know you, maam?"  Sunshine came out of the bushes and stood in front of them.  Sunshine:"Do you KNOW me?! Of course you do, baby. We live together. We're in love. We do the horizontal mumbo three times a day......MATT! It's me. Your Okie. Your Dokie. Your Annie Oakley!!"  Matt's memory was struggling to return. All at once, Pale Horse threw a tomahawk, knocking the pistol from Sunshine's hand.    AND NOW THE CONCLUSION:    "They've Got Matt."  Subtitle........(2)" A Labor Of Love"    As the gun fell from Sunshine's hand, Sunshine reached down for a rock and threw it in Pale Horse's direction....It caught him right between the ..........eyes! He was stunned and started talking in tongues......" You know,(4) A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. And another thing.......I want my mommy!!" He fell to the ground,unconscious.   Bushwhacker thought to himself...."That silly *** Shawnee was (3)A legend in his own time." Then he got back to business! He got a shot off at Sunshine before Matt tackled him. Sunshine grabbed her arm!! Matt wrestled Bushwhacker against a tree. Bushwhacker kicked Matt away, who then  tumbled in the river. As Matt was trying to get his bearings, Bushwhacker grabbed him by the hair and started pushing his head under water!! Sunshine jumped on his back. She pulled her knife out of her boot and stabbed him!! He let go of Matt, and slowly turned around.   Bushwhacker:" "I've been done in by a little ol' girl. Imagine that."  Sunshine:"Well mister.....(1) A job worth doing is worth doing well."     When Matt and Sunshine got on solid land, they sat down and tried to catch their breaths. Matt looked at her......."I had a feeling that when you popped out of those woods, it was going to be my lucky day." He smiled. "Oh, my God, you've been shot." He started tending to her wound.  Sunshine:" I'm okay, really. What made you think that seeing me would make this your lucky day?"  Matt:"Well........(5) A little bird  told me. You're my little bird, you know." Sunshine and Matt grabbed each other and embraced. "You've always been my little bird,  SunnyMac. You told me once that if I ever got lost, you would find me."     Once they buried the two bad guys, they headed home.  Matt:" I think that after Doc takes care of your arm, you and I should get right in bed."  Sunshine: "Ahhhhhhh......... (6) A man after my own heart."|`|ORb7aMfXaa	What you don,t know,  your better off.    A man thats poor,  is rich with love.

YOVsbP4daa	What helps me is studying at a park or outside, where there are less distractions for those of us who get stuck browsing Wikipedia/Yahoo Answers for hours.   Find a friend to help you study.  Find a podcast about your subject and listen to it before you go to sleep -- you'll find all sorts of new and interesting things that will make studying more interesting.  Take good notes. This is essential.  Study at the same time each day, or at least have an alternating 2 day schedule with set study time. This will build a routine.   Always do your studying first when you get home/back to your dorms. This gives you the rest of the day to ponder what you've learned.  Talk to your teachers -- many teachers are extremely interesting and know a lot more about the subjects they teach than they give off.   Don't listen to music with lyrics or leave the TV on. Other voices will just distract you.   Tell your parents what you've learned today.|`|p3JGYWrBaa	We are all like that, leaving to the last minute.

zxQT3Uo5aa	It really depends on how it is used and how informed the user is in what is being said.  It refers to any characteristic of Semites: Hebrew, Babylonian, Phoenicians, Arabs, and Assyrian) as in languages but generally it is used colloquially to refer to any Jew.  It may be referring to the cultural qualities or ideas.  That would include southwestern Asia, and northern Africa.

If you say it a lot, he will start using simpler words for you, as a favour to you. He probably thinks that you know what he means.

ORonhAuvaa	You will have plenty of time and if you don't overspend, you will have enough money to go on vacation each year. I have done that for over 25 years and I really have been able to do what I want to do.     One concern that I have is that many art and music teachers are getting cut right now because of the monetary crisis. It will be very hard to get a job in that field  because there will be many experienced teachers applying also.    I would have a back up plan and get yourself certified in something in which there is a high level of need in your area. If you want to travel, you might consider becoming an ESOL teacher, so that not only can you sell art, but you can teach English as a summer job in any country in the world.    Teaching is a wonderful career. You don't make as much money as some people, but you have very good benefits and a good amount of time off, usually two weeks at Xmas, 1 week spring break and around two months in the summer. Plus all of the National holidays. If you value time more than money AND if you love kids, this could be the field for you.|`|inZ9CWBiaa	I teach in New Zealand, and we have about 5-6 weeks off during our summer. I often travel during that time. This does mean that I rent rather than own, and my car is a 1989 Toyota Corona! I wouldn't trade the travel for anything though!    One note - I had a colleague who was an artist who came back into teaching. He found that the teaching was so energy-consuming that he had little left for his art. When he was offered a gallery show, he actually resigned, as he knew he couldn't create the way he wanted to and still teach the way he wanted to. He wasn't strictly an art teacher, though, which might have made a difference.|`|yp0g1E02aa	Keep in mind there are different salary ranges for teachers.  Starting off you won't have that much dough.  I know traveling teachers, higher up on scale or who make vacations a priority.    When I worked at Catholic schools I worked a second job to make ends meet.  Later I made better money in public system and summers about paying for graduate school (many enter the field with a grad. degree--I preferred having experience to my studies).    This summer will be my first after eight years "off", but family life dominates.    You do have time for a life, especially one that recharges you.  It is a challenge in some settings and you will have to juggle priorities.
1096145c0fe649afc8c78279707ac778aa	Before you take either test, they ask you what universities you want the scores sent to. You can leave these blank, but when you fill it out BEFORE the test, those 4 are free. If you have the college board send your scores after you get them, they charge about $9 per score sent.  The SAT is a reasoning test, and you don't need to know anything special to take it, just practice answering the types of questions.  The ACT is more on things you have learned in school, so for math, there might be questions on trigonometry or algebra, nothing too specific, but you do need to know the formulas by heart.  I took an SAT practice course from the Princeton Review, and their method of eliminating answers helped me on the ACT, but not very much of the actual problem solving things helped me much.  I suggest you check the college board and ACT websites for some practice tests. Those above anything else can help you figure out which test is better for you.

lbR1IoiSaa	The reason you're probably not finding any 'resources' as you call them, to know what the "most important subjects" to study for your critical thinking test is - there are no specific subjects to help you study for critical thinking.      Critical thinking tests are tests that examine how your brain works, when presented with certain arguments, facts, and other pieces of information that you'll find within a question, statement, phrase or story.     Critical thinking tests determine your ability to think logically, recognize fallacies, make inferences, know the parts of an argument, how to break them down, and engage in reasoning skills, just to name a few :-(.      How to take a critical thinking test cannot be 'taught' - as you're hoping to learn - within a few days, critical thinking is a skill that must be learned - that's why they suggested an entire book.       If you're aware of and can recognize / state the different types of fallacies, plus create your own, you know what inferences, arguments (and their parts), and the different types of reasoning are, and can engage in knowledgable conversation regarding . . . you'll be fine.  If not, then I STRONGLY urge you to cancel trying to test out, and take the course.  If you don't, and you actually pass the test, but only by the seat of your pants, it will affect the rest of your college and working career, because in order to be successful throughout a bachelor's program, you MUST be a STRONG critical thinker, and it is a skill, not a subject :-).     Sorry to sound harsh, if this isn't really what you wanted to find out, but it's the truth.  You'd be surprised how much useful information you will acquire from the course if you take it.  It will help you engage in intelligent conversation and succeed all the way throughout your life, which is really what you want - not just a grade, and to save a few bucks - - right?     Whatever your choice, good luck !

4maLlESdaa	Cousins (or first cousins) have grandparents in common. Second cousins have great-grandparents in common, third cousins have great-great-grandparents in common, and so forth. In these cases, the cousins are in the same generation.    Cousins that are once, twice, etc. removed are that many generations apart. If Bob and Alice are first cousins once removed, then a set of Bob's grandparents are also Alice's great-grandparents (and therefore one of Alice's parents is a first cousin to Bob). Or vice-versa: Bob's great-grandparents could be Alice's grandparents.    As far as 3rd cousin twice removed goes, third cousins have great-great-grandparents in common. The twice removed means that one of the cousins is two generations away, so one set of one cousin's great-great-grandparents is the same as one set of the other cousin's great-great-great-great-grandparents.|`|MINy26pjaa	Awaywa's answer (above) is literally correct.

1kOIXVHoaa	What online school does require a parent (to be present)???    Okay, having homeschooled all my life, I have never heard of an online school that requires a parent to be physically present, there with you, looking over your shoulder, in order for you to enrol. The forty or so online schools that I know about (in Australia and Britain) only ask that you should have a parent (or govie) at home who is willing to act as a point of contact for the online school. They're not expected to physically be in the house with you 24/7 whenever you're doing school any more than any day school expects your parent to be in the classroom with you! Once you become a teenager and therefore ought to be capable of organising yourself, online schools just want to know there's a parent around so they have a named person to contact if, for example, you stop turning in your work etc; and to cover their arses legally.     If your mum's happy for you to be 'home alone' with just the computer for company and lessons to occupy yourself whilst she's at work, that's between you and her. She can fulfill her obligation to 'supervise' your schoolwork simply by asking you how it went and whether you had any problems once she gets home from work.    Anyway how on earth are they going to know?!? Have a magic chip hidden in their computer!?! They ring unexpectedly, you just don't answer the 'phone; or answer the phone, apologise and tell them she's in the lav or in the shower; or too busy working herself to talk to them right now and tell them to try again later...    P.S. The only companies offering 'free' cyberschools that I've ever come across are:  i) K12 (but only for residents of certain US states);   ii) Kaplan (allegedly); and  iii) Connections Academy (but again, only available free in certain US states)|`|r18PoGJiaa	Depends on your state.

BPoZPvGoaa	These are pretty easy but instead of giving you the answer.  I will attempt to guide you to the answer.    a. Find the total means SUM which is an addition      3 1/2 + 2 1/4+ 2 5/6 =      to start any fraction addition and subtraction you will have to simplified the fraction     3 1/2 = 2*3+1= 7/2     2 1/4 = 2*4+1= 9/4     2 5/6 = 2*6+5=17/6     and then find the common denominator(the bottom number of all three 2, 4 and 6).  To do that you would need to start with the largest number which is 6.  2*3 = 6 but 4 can't multiply by a whole number to get 6 so we will have to use the next number which is 6*2 = 12.  Now, 12 /2= 6 and 12/4 = 3 so we can use 12 as the common denominator.    7* 6/2*6 + 9*3/4*3 + 17*2/6*2 =  42/12+27/12+34/12 = (42+27+34)/12= 103/12 = 8 7/12h.    B and C is the difference which are subtraction problems.  do the same as A to convert the number into simple fractions, find the common denominator and then do the subtraction.

(a) total hours = monday + tuesday + wednesday  = 168/ 48 + 108/48 + 136/48 = 412/ 48  simplifies to 103/12    (b) monday - wednesday  168/48 - 108/48 = 60/48  simplifies to 5/4    (c) wednesday- tuesday  136/48 - 108/48 = 28/48  simplifies to 7/12    i hope this helped!|`|sux1aIHEaa	a) 8 hrs 35 mins  b)40 mins  c) 35 mins|`|8b0b7XTbaa	a) 8 7/12 (8 hours and 35 mins)    b) 8/12 of an hour (40 mins)    c) 7/12 of an hour (35 mins)    I hope I got it right!!|`|AA11327884	In order to work with fractions whilst multiplying or dividing, you need to ensure that all fractions have the same denominator [number on bottom of fraction]  first, I would turn each fraction into a common fraction - here I would use twelfths [ /12 ] as 12 is the lowest common multiple of 2, 4 and 6.  so 3 + 1/2 = 3 + 6/12 [multiplied top and bottom numbers of fraction by number required to get denominator to 12 - in this case 6]  2 1/4 = 2 + 3/12 [multiplied by 3]  2 5/6 = 2  + 10/12  [multiplied by 2]    you can then add up whole numbers and fractions easily as all fractions are in same form, so add or subtract as required  add or subtract top number [numerator] and leave bottom number alone - for example:  3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4  17/39 + 2 /39 = 19/39      Finally, you then need to work out what 1 1/12 of an hour is. Divide 60 by 1 to get this answer [numbers of minutes of an hour broken up into 12 equal parts]  your whole number part of an answer will be hours, the fraction is minutes. there may be some fractions that the number on top becomes bigger than the denominator. in these cases, its a top heavy fraction and you need to convert it into a mixed number again. 5/4 is 1 whole and 1/4 as there are 4/4 in one whole...

fvPT5GRXaa	I am 25yrs old also and going to school for the first time really...Your bankruptcy is a non-issue.  Where everyone starts is by filling out the FAFSA and the official website is fafsa.ed.gov  Do not get sucked into the fake FAFSA sites that fill it out for you and charge you a fee. The real FAFSA is free to fill out and is MANDATORY to receive any kind of grants or loans.  Once that is filled out, you apply to the school you want to go to and they are automtically sent the FAFSA.  The school then sends you an award letter which will tell you that you are eligible for some or all of the following:    Pell Grant - up to $4800/yr (does not get paid back)  State Aid - up to $5000/yr (does not get paid back)  FSEOG Grant - ranges (does not get paid back)  Perkins Loans - up to $4000/yr (gets paid back to school)  Federal Stafford/Direct loans - limits vary, gets paid to fed gov.    Now, your award is based on the schools Cost of Attendance NOT the tuition. For example, my schools tuition is $3400 per year but the Cost of Attendance is $17,000 per year.  So if you receive aid in the amount of $10,000, you keep the difference.|`|il0aaYsdaa	The person above me gave some great information but for one piece.  The bankruptcy situation may affect how much and what kind of aid you get.  They're not too keen on giving loans to people who've defaulted, even if it wasn't necessarily your fault.  For the most part what that means is that even though you qualify as an independent for filing purposes you may need a co-signor so they can verify they'll get their money back.|`|WQAZl8Axaa	try this    http://www.freestuffpromo.com/grants

O4oCqaKkaa	Project Risk Management Tenet  1: Assess Early and Often  Project risk management must occur throughout the life cycle of the project. Uncertainties can be discovered at any time, while the relative probability and consequence of identified risks can change over time. For instance, the farther along a project goes into the schedule, the more likely you will lose team members to other efforts. In addition, the impact of poorly defined requirements will typically have a greater impact on project success in the latter stages of the project. It is imperative that the project team address uncertainty early and often, throughout the entire term of the project.    Project Risk Management Tenet  2: Build It into the Schedule  In order to adequately deal with uncertain events, the project schedule must include risk management activities. The project manager must ensure that risk assessment (identification and analysis) and response planning initiatives are a regular occurrence. Depending on the size, scope, and complexity of the project, risk reviews can either be an agenda item on the weekly review meeting or a bi-weekly review by itself. Either way, the project manager must incorporate consistent risk management mechanisms into the project schedule.    Project Risk Management Tenet  3: Communicate and Illustrate Ownership  The inherent uncertainty of risk events tend to make key stakeholders avoid the subject altogether. Therefore, it is up to the project manager to employ effective communications and clear ownership of risk elements. Potential risks need to be clearly identified and assessed, and accompanied by targeted, yet realistic, response strategies. Simply put, risk response strategies need to function as a rifle, not a shotgun. Also, the project leader must ensure that team members are properly aligned as owners for specific risk events. When key stakeholders know who to contact regarding a critical uncertainty, clear communication is better facilitated.|`|79d325a9d7089b91075a8438b79efeaeaa	Well I don't know the full answer, but this should help    Three Contraints on the Life Cycle  Cost  Time  Scope

J0bqxozSaa	Dear Friend,          I personally think that Kuwait English School is the best British School in Kuwait and this may be a biased opinion because I graduated from there but I will give you the top schools and their info:    Kuwait English School    Kuwait English School is a private school providing British curriculum education from Kindergarten to 6th Form A Levels, located in Salwa, Kuwait. It was established in 1979 by Mohammed Jassim Al Saddah. Mr Al Saddah is still the school sponsor, but the Director of the school is Mrs Rhoda Muhmood.    It is divided into several departments: Kindergarten, Infants, Juniors, Seniors and the Green Unit, a department for children with special educational needs. Each of the departments has its own Principal.    The Senior school is defined as Years 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and the Sixth Form. The principal of the Senior school is Mrs. Janet Carew, and there are two vice-principals: Mr. John Sherwood and Mr. John Price. At the moment, 800 of the school's 2000 students are enrolled in the Senior school.    Kuwait English School is known as one of the best private British schools in the Middle East and regularly posts the best O level and A level results in Kuwait.    The English School of Fahaheel     The English School Fahaheel was founded in 1968 by a group of expatriate parents under the guidance of the incumbent British Consul.  In that same year the school was recognised by the Private Education Department of the Ministry of Education in Kuwait, and opened its doors to a handful of expatriate students.    At that time there was no other school in South Kuwait providing an English education other than a company school established in Ahmadi by Kuwait Oil Company for the children of its employees. This company school was closed in 1970.   A block of classrooms and an Assembly Hall were built at The English School Fahaheel, thus enabling places to be offered to a proportion of Kuwait Oil Company children in September 1970.  Due to the steady increase in the expatriate English-speaking population in Kuwait, it became evident by late 1976 that further expansion would be necessary in the not-too-distant future. In 1978 an upper storey to the main building was constructed, substantially increasing the number of student places available.     Progress and expansion continued unabated until the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The occupying Iraqi army used the school premises as a command centre and destroyed or looted furniture, educational materials and anything of value. Following the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, the owner of the school, Mr. Ibrahim Shuhaiber M.Sc., was determined to see it thrive once again. A major clean-up operation began as the British Army forces in Kuwait assisted in clearing mines and ammunition from the surrounding area and beach.     The English School Fahaheel soon regained its position as one of Kuwait's leading English schools, achieving excellence in education.    The New English School    The New English School, Kuwait (N.E.S.) was founded in 1969 by Mr Tareq S Rajab. It was the first, private, co-educational day-school to offer a British style curriculum from Kindergarten to 'A' level. In September 1974, the school moved to its present purpose-built campus in Jabriya, a popular suburb of Kuwait. A continual programme of re-investment in the site has provided two new teaching blocks, two gymnasia, dance and pottery studios and a top class sports compound. NES boasts a superb 'armchair' theatre, the only one of its type in Kuwait. The school serves both the local and international community, with children from over 50 nationalities. Close ties are maintained with the U.K. and with other overseas British and International schools. N.E.S. is a member of ECIS and BSME.    The school is administered by a Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Director and Financial Manager.

There is a 20m x 12m indoor/heated swimming pool, a full-size gymnasium, outdoor sports facilities, computer centres, and science block with laboratories for biology, chemistry and physics, theatre, art room, and other facilities.    The Kuwait National English School is recognized by the Kuwait Ministry of Education and is an official member of UNESCO Associated Schools Project.

A full-range of options is offered for IGCSE and A/S and A-Level subjects as well as a full range of English tests from JET to FCE and TOEFL. A 'Leaving Certificate' is given to students at the end of their studies at the school.    Students at Kuwait National English School who have learning difficulties join the SEN department, which offers new facilities. Some of these students are also integrated within the mainstream, but get extra support from the specialist teachers from this department.

13036705c51395a37f80afc37de0b141aa	When I was in college, student loans didn't start accruing interest until after graduation and you got 10 years to pay them off.  Plus you didn't have to make payments until 6 months after you graduated.  Since then some of the tax laws have changed.  I think your best approach is to talk to an accountant.  $34K is a lot of money to be on the hook for and I doubt you can get 10 years to pay that back unless it is secured by an asset like a house.  And if you do have a house you're going to need enough equity to cash out.    The fact you are still in school (and I assume unemployed) makes getting a loan very, very difficult.      Debt is a *****.  Take what you have, look at your income, look at what your payments are/will be and see if you can fit it all into a monthly budget so you don't default and can still have cash flow at the end of the month.  Make the budget fit your income and not the other way around.    But to your other comment... $14K to cover moving expenses?  HAHAHAHA!  I don't think so.    Go see a financial professional and remember cash is king.|`|ICBKpZeAaa	There is some advice here.|`|AA11780435	Oh ok I got this for you...    Better check on this...

When he died, leaving his wife with no heir, the British placed Ramgarh under their administration. Avantibai vowed to fight the British to regain her land and her throne. She raised an army of four thousand and personally led it against the British in 1857. When, after a few months' struggle, she saw that her defeat was imminent, she killed herself on her own sword  --------------------------------------...  When Vikramaditya Singh, the ruler of Ramgarh State died leaving behind his wife Avantibai and no heir to the throne, the British put the state under court administration. Avantibai vowed to win back her land from the British. She raised an army of four thousand men and led it herself against the British in 1857. A fierce battle ensured and Avantibai fought most valiantly but could not hold out for long against the superior strength of the British army. When her defeat become imminent she killed herself with her own sword and became a martyr on 20-03-1858.  --------------------------------------...  Rani Avantibai, queen of Ramgarh State in central India, is remembered for her valiant fight against the British during the 1857 War of Independence, when she made the supreme sacrifice of her life for the freedom of motherland. The blatant annexations of estates by British officials antagonised the local rulers and as the events of the Revolt of 1857 unfolded, they became the most dangerous opponents of the British. Avantibai was the queen of King Vikramaditya Singh of Ramgarh. When Vikramaditya Singh became incapable of handling the affairs of the State due to ill health, Avantibai rose to the occasion and took charge of the administration. In 1851, Avantibai felt humiliated by the appointment of an English Tehsildar for Ramgarh. When the Revolt of 1857 broke out, Rani Avantibai raised an army of four thousand and led it herself. In the first encounter which took place in a village named Kheri, she routed the British troops. However, stung by the defeat the British came back with vengeance and launched an attack on Ramgarh. Avantibai's courage and fighting spirit was not enough to match their mighty military machine with all its brutal strength. The Rani was forced to leave Ramgarh and move to the dense forests on the hill of Devharigarh. Surrounded and faced with the prospect of defeat Avantibai thought it better to sacrifice her life rather than to surrender. On 20th March 1858, Rani Avantibai became a martyr.|`|L1UoWti5aa	Rani Avantibai (died March 20, 1858) was the wife of Vikramaditya Singh, the ruler of the Indian state of Ramgarh.

AA12040714	First of all, I am not sure what the IV Ivy Leagues are, but I go to an Ivy, and there are 8, not 4.   Also, there really is no cutoff for getting into these college. There are averages that students generally fall into, but they are not set in stone.   For example: When I was applying, most candidates had a 1400 or above out 0f 1600 on their SATs, but I know people who only achieved a 1050 and still were admitted.   Do not be discouraged by your scores. You can take the test over if you please, but remember that all parts of your application, ie. gpa, essays, extracurricular activities, and recommendations are also VERY important in the process of getting you admitted.   The process is not as strict as it seems and they might just accept you based on your great personality!    Good Luck!|`|AA12056634	The first step would be to learn that they are "ivy league" universities, not "IV".  Ivy because they are old and had ivy growing on their walls, not because they were intravenous drug users!    Also, just because a university is ivy league does not mean it will be the best fit for you.  There are tons of quality schools with excellent educational opportunities that are not ivy league.  Stanford, Swarthmore, NYU, Northwestern... these are all great examples.  The best thing to do would be to look for a college that would be a good fit for you, don't just get hung up on a university because it is ivy league.    As far as the SATs, I have no idea because I applied to colleges 10 years ago, so I can't help you there.  But good luck!  =D

Professor Roy Wilkinson of Sheffield University has identified a pyramid of skills which A level examinations try to test.    http://www.bized.ac.uk/reference/studysk...    http://www.how-to-study.com/Essay.htm    http://www.didyouknow.org/words/effectiv...    http://condor.depaul.edu/~dsimpson/style...    http://www.studygs.net/    http://www.stlcc.cc.mo.us/mc/support/cwc...    http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/checklis.ht...    http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/writpap.htm...    http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/essays.html    http://www2.actden.com/writ%5Fden/tips/e...    http://www.virtualsalt.com/index.htm    http://www.englishbiz.co.uk/    http://www.english.bham.ac.uk/staff/tom/...    http://www.teachnlearn.org/index.htm    http://www.how-to-study.com/prefixes.htm    http://members.tripod.com/~lklivingston/...    http://www.world-english.org/    http://www.midlandit.co.uk/education/ind...    http://www.brocku.ca/library/reference/e...    http://www.englishforums.com/    http://www.powa.org/    http://www.tee-garden.com/eberman/Creati...    http://www.editorsforstudents.com/    http://www.writinghelp-central.com/    http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/    http://essayinfo.com/    http://mrbraiman.com    http://www.scribendi.com/advice/improve_...    http://www.mindtools.com/speedrd.html    Good luck    Kevin, Liverpool, England.|`|87ff24cbc3a3fdd436a2968c8a2a8da9aa	The first step in any successful college writing venture is reading the assignment. While this sounds like a simple task, it can be a tough one. This handout will help you unravel your assignment directions and help you begin to craft an effective response. Much of the following advice will involve translating typical assignment terms and practices into meaningful clues to the type of writing your instructor expects. Believe it or not, many assignments follow a basic format. Assignments often begin with an overview of the topic, include a central verb or verbs that describe the task, and offer some additional suggestions, questions, or prompts to get you started|`|2ee4dd465b13b2b5528be4a8e3d32943aa	HEY THERE!

02hcNMxKaa	This basically means that you've got COMPLETELY the wrong idea about something.    For instance, if someone were to ask you, "What's the meaning behind the movie The Wizard of Oz?" and you answered, "Oh, that movie is about how to take care of your dog.  That's why they made the movie, so you can see how Dorothy mistreats Toto.  And the bad behavior of hers is represented by the Wicked Witch.  Also, the Tin Man is kind of like a can of dog food, so that's why he was in the movie." ...well, I'd say that that interpretation of the movie is VERY "far off the mark".  It's completely "out of left field", not really related to anything logical!    As for "...can't even give them points for cleverness"... Well, sometimes someone may say something pretty random but, even though it's wrong, it might still be kind of clever in its own way.  But if you say that something is "so far off the mark that one can't even give them points for cleverness", this is pretty much saying that they're so far "off-base" that there's NOTHING redeeming about their viewpoint at all... it's not funny, it's not clever, it's nuthin'!  :)

Usually TA and RA positions are held by graduate students.    Work study jobs, at least the ones I know about, are on campus jobs, and you get paid hourly. They can range from working in one of the college admin offices, to possibly being a lab assistant. Who gets them depends on the skills you have, when you apply, and are not always need based.

sWL0xxeraa	Analogy plays a significant role in problem solving, decision making, perception, memory, creativity, emotion, explanation and communication. It lies behind basic tasks such as the identification of places, objects and people, for example, in face perception and facial recognition systems. It has been argued that analogy is "the core of cognition" (Hofstadter in Gentner et al. 2001).  Specific analogical language comprises exemplification, comparisons, metaphors, similes, allegories, and parables, but not metonymy. Phrases like and so on, and the like, as if, and the very word like also rely on an analogical understanding by the receiver of a message including them. Analogy is important not only in ordinary language and common sense, where proverbs and idioms give many examples of its application, but also in science, philosophy and the humanities. The concepts of association, comparison, correspondence, mathematical and morphological homology, homomorphism, iconicity, isomorphism, metaphor, resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In cognitive linguistics, the notion of conceptual metaphor may be equivalent to that of analogy

The money from scholarships is usually sent directly from the scholarship funding source to your school.    - Yes, they create an account for you and it keeps track of your expenses from the college and any income you have coming in from scholarships, grants, loans, etc.    - If you have more money than you need, what happens depends on where the money came from.  If it is federal grants and loans, then that money is given to you.  Scholarships are usually not of any "cash" value, so you don't usually get any remainder sent to you.  However, every scholarship is different and have their own "fine print" you need to read about the conditions of the scholarship.  Yes, sometimes the school will let you "charge" your books against your financial aid account.    - some scholarships can go towards dorms, again, EVERY scholarship is different and you will have to read the terms to see what are considered legitimate charges the scholarship will pay for.|`|cV4tAnY2aa	~ How is the university gonna know that I won a scholarship and how are they gonna get the money ??    *Most scholarships give the money directly to the show.

Do i get to take money from there to buy books and stuff ?    *Most times. The money is given directly to you.     ~ Does the scholarship money go towards dorms ? or is it just for education ?    *It depends on the types of scholarship. Some are tuition only.  Some are books tuition and fees, and others are all college fees.

jh9iPYvXaa	Ok ... the area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times its height. So if we set the little base size as x, the big base is x+4, then the area is (2x+4)/2 * 8 = 8x+16.    A square with a side 8cm would have area 64 cm^2.    so 8x+16 = 64;  8x = 48 and x=6 cm.|`|ZDiohznsaa	alright, i tried something, see if it works...  so the area of the trapazoid equals the area of the square with a height of 8.  Which is 64.  The area of a trapazoid = altitude x ([base1 +base2] /2)....so 8 x [(x)(x+4)] / 2  and since that is equal to the area of the square you get 64=8[(x)(x+4)/2]  You end up with x^2 + 4x = 16, so subtract 16 from both sides...  x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0  and solve by quadratic formula!    (X is the length of the smaller base and (X+4) is the length of the bigger base)    Good luck, and hope this helps! =]|`|tktpraYVaa	idk but your really  smokinn hawtt  lol  =]|`|BMMMNnAQaa	what did you say after math problem...?|`|RONmoue9aa	the square will be 8x8 so 64. the biggest trapezoid base is 4cm bigger than the small one so the smallest one is 6 an the biggest is 10 so the area of the trapezoid is also 64cm. i think|`|oe81XFO0aa	well the area of the square is obviously 64cm^2  the formula for the area of a trapezoid is A=((1/2)(b1+b2))(h) where h is the height and b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides. So then you plug in the numbers   64= ((1/2)(x+(x-4))(8)  64=((1/2)(2x-4))(8)  64=(x-2)(8)  64=8x-16  8=x-2  x=10...so the bases are 10 and 6  and to check you simply plug those bases back into the formula so   A=((1/2)(10+6))(8)  A=(8)(8)  A=64cm^2 which was the area of the square, which is also the area of the trapezoid  **(oh sorry, i just did it the oldschool way, that SADMEB way is pretty awesome)|`|b6GLnqiSaa	*answer*|`|Z03zgM0maa	Umm....yes you're hot.

Now we have to figure out how to relate all of this information.  we'll need to use the area to figure out what the variable s is.    Area of your Square:  side x side  8 cm x 8 cm  64 cm^2    since the problem says the areas are the same, we know the area of the trapezoid is also 64 cm^2.    Area of your Trapezoid:  [ (little side + big side) / 2 ] x height  [ (s cm + s cm + 4 cm) / 2 ] x 8 cm  [ (2s cm + 4 cm) / 2 ] x 8 cm  [s cm + 2 cm] x 8 cm  8s cm^2 + 16 cm^2    Since we know the areas are equal, we know that  64 cm^2 = 8s cm^2 + 16 cm^2  48 cm^2 = 8s cm^2  divide by 8 on both sides,  s = 6 cm    since s was our little side, we know that's 6 cm  since the big side was s + 4 cm, that's 10 cm    You can check your math by plugging the numbers back into our area of a trapezoid function to make sure we get 64 cm^2:  [ (6 cm + 10 cm) / 2 ] x height  [ (16 cm) / 2 ] x 8 cm  [8 cm] x 8 cm = 64 cm^2    Woo hoo!

AA10439008	Write an equation using % times amount of each part = % times amount of total    1. Let x = water evaporated (it's 0% salt).  When you take x away from 300, you get 300 - x left.  So...    2(300) - 0(x) = 5(300 - x)    600 = 1500 - 5x  -900 = -5x  900/5 = x = 180 L    X = pure antifreeze (it's 100% antifreeze) and x + 12 = total when combined.  So...  100x + 40(12) = 60 (x + 12)  100x + 480 = 60x + 720    (solve for x, that's the easy part)

AA10067221	reflection-   The change in direction of a wave, such as a light or sound wave, away from a boundary the wave encounters. Reflected waves remain in their original medium rather than entering the medium they encounter. According to the law of reflection, the angle of reflection of a reflected wave is equal to its angle of incidence.     refraction-   A change of direction that light undergoes when it enters a medium with a different density from the one through which it has been traveling  for example, when, after moving through air, it passes through a prism.     diffraction-   The breaking up of an incoming wave by some sort of geometrical structure  for example, a series of slits  followed by reconstruction of the wave by interference. Diffraction of light is characterized by alternate bands of light and dark or bands of different colors.  Basically, the bending and spreading of a wave, such as a light wave, around the edge of an object.

AA11059368	If you take a derivative of this function and set it to 0 and solve for x, you'll have the x-coordinate of the vertex:    h(x) = x^2 - x - 6  h'(x) = 2x - 1  0 = 2x - 1  2x = 1  x = 1/2    To find the y-coordinate, use the original equation:    h(x) = x^2 - x - 6  h(1/2) = (1/2)^2 - (1/2) - 6  = 1/4 - 1/2 - 6  = -25/4 or -6 1/4    So your vertex is at (1/2, -25/4).  Your axis of symmetry will be a vertical line (since this is a y= parabola) going through the vertex, so the equation will be x = 1/2.    As for the least value, that would be the vertex of the function.  This opens up, so the lowest part would be the vertex, at -25/4.

AA11604732	Brown is already out of the question for you.    The University of Texas is already highly unlikely for you.  You still have a shot if you really raise your grades -- and move to Texas.    Unless you bring up your grades considerably, Penn State is highly unlikely for you.  Less than ten percent of those admitted to Penn State have a GPA below 3.25.  You have to get very serious about your grades to get in.    You can probably get into Temple, unless you start doing worse.|`|fkuKUxrpaa	First off, Brown doesn't even have a journalism program at all. It is a huge reach, and not likely you would go there. I'm not trying to be mean, but need to to be realistic. There is no Ivy League that has an undergraduate journalism program and wouldn't be worth to go to one and major in something else. Columbia University has a graduate program and that's the best to get a Masters.     Temple is good for you, but not known for journalism. Texas is a reach/fit, but not known for journalism. They both have programs though. They are both fine schools, but not great in that field. Penn State is a fit, and has the best journalism school out of your list. The best undergraduate schools for journalism are: NYU, Northwestern, UC- Chapel Hill, Boston College and USC. I don't think you would get into any of them, but would try two of them and see if you get in. Northwestern may just be too big of a reach, and UC- Chapel Hill is hard for out of state kids. Then of course you know NYU) (average GPA 3.6) and USC(average GPA 3.7) are also hard to get into. BC is a great school for journalism. The University of Missouri is very great for journalism and a match for you. You may also like to look at The University of Indiana- Bloomington. I may be doing a summer journalism program there.     Flagler College is a liberal arts college in St. Augustine, Florida and has a good journalism program. You would have to major in communication with a concentration on journalism. Though, not many people have heard of this program at all. It is like a loss secret of the world. It has the most beautiful campus ever, and has small class sizes. It has the beach and the campus use to be a hotel. It is also cheap for a private school, and has good financial aid.     UGA (reach), The University of Maryland (reach), The University of Minnesota (not sure about how hard it is, but do know it has a good journalism school), Syracuse University (slight reach, but really good school and best out of these), Ohio University (decent school, but great journalism program), Fordham (reach), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (not sure, good journalism school), University of Massachusetts Amherst (idk, but good journalism school), Suny Purchase (reach/match), Boston University (reach) and The University of Florida (reach) are also good journalism schools. If your grades get really low Arizona State has a good journalism program and you can get a BA and an MA at the same time, not the greatest school though. You still have time, but focus on those top schools I listed. You have all junior years. I would just focus on higher B's and keep it up. Good Luck!|`|LxEAT0XKaa	You have low to no odds at Brown. No offense, but you'd need to be in the top 10% of your class. I have cousins at Temple, and you seem similar to them.

Go into challenging classes, ask your teachers for help, and study real hard, and you may have a better shot at these schools.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	You have zero chance at Brown.

e5jQenasaa	The first naturalization law in the United States was the 1795 Naturalization Act which restricted citizenship to "free white persons" who had resided in the country for five years. The next significant change in the law came in 1870, when the law was broadened to allow both Whites and African-Americans, though Asians were still excluded from citizenship. Immigration was otherwise unlimited.    In 1882 the Chinese Exclusion Act specifically forbid Chinese immigration, overturning the 1868 Burlingame Treaty which had encouraged it. The "temporary" ban was extended repeatedly and made permanent in 1904. It was the culmination of decades of agitation, particularly by Californians, who had passed their own Anti-Coolie Act in 1862. The ban was deeply resented but was not repealed until 1943, and only then to reward a wartime ally.|`|XbIoIUclaa	the mid 1800s saw a lot of political upheavals in europe with the traditional monarchs against democratic movements.

0aJlEmIxaa	Hester Prynne: A beautiful puritan woman full of strong passions, Hester Prynne is the main character in the story.  Employed as the village seamstress, she is strong and caring, helping anyone she can when he or she are in need.  With a penitent heart, Hester travels through the story becoming only a shadow of her former passionate loving self.  Other than the scarlet letter, she was a very moral woman whose only joy in life was her daughter Pearl.     Roger Chillingsworth: The missing husband of Hester Prynne.  He shows up the day that Hester is put on public display and does not show himself as her husband.  A scholar and a man of medicine, his soul purpose in his life becomes revenge against the man who helped his wife sin.  By the end of the story, he is shown to be an evil character.     Pearl: Looked on as the devil's child, Pearl is the only one in the story that is purely innocent.  She is passionate, intelligent, and energetic.  Pearl is in touch with nature and with her mother's feelings.  Ever since she was born, Pearl had a fascination with the scarlet letter that is a constant reminder for Hester of her sin.    Arthur Dimmesdale: The minister of the town that the people adore, Arthur was the secret lover of Hester Prynne.  He was a sickly man who took his sin very seriously.  He spent the seven years since his indiscretion with Mistress Prynne trying to repent.  He wore down his body with his penitence and his sin ate away his soul.  In the end, he frees himself from his guilt by admitting to everyone his sin.      To find the specific information you are looking for do a search.

Fresh currents of thought were wearing down institutionalized traditions. New ideas and new approaches to old institutions were setting the stage for great revolutions to come.      I. Social Milieu  The main figures of the enlightenment are fairly well known: Descartes, Pascal, Bayle, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau. There were others whom we could call antagonists to the dominant note, people like Rousseau, Zinzendorf, Wesley, Vico, and Hume. The pervasive appeal, as expressed by Voltaire, was to the      1. autonomy of reason   2. perfectibility and progress   3. confidence in the ability to discover causality   4. principles governing nature, man and society   5. assault on authority   6. cosmopolitan solidarity of enlightened intellectuals   7. disgust with nationalism.   These enlightened philosophes made extravagant claims, but there was more to them than merely negations and disinfectants. It was primarily a French movement because French culture dominated Europe and because their ideas were expressed in the environment of the Parisian salon. Therefore, it was basically a middle-class movement. They, nevertheless labored for man in general, for humanity.     Clearly the feudal edifice was crumbling, but there was no real antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy as yet. One can detect the bourgeoisie struggling for freedom from state regulations and for liberty of commercial activity. It is also evident that a wave of prosperity brought a greater degree of self-confidence to the bourgeoisie. Great fortunes were made every town. Mercantilism was loosening its hold on the economy. By 1750 the reading public came into existence because of increasing literacy. Yet the philosophes lived a precarious life. They never knew whether they would be imprisoned or courted. Yet they assumed the air of an army on the march.

Maybe after you read 3 chapters of American history, you get a 30 minute nap; or, when you finish the first draft of your psych paper, you get a bowl of ice cream.    You'll be surprised at how quickly you are able to mark off the items on your list, and you won't feel like you've spent all weekend studying.

CrDMqYAdaa	Depends what you mean by 'helped'.  1. There is the skeletal muscle pump. This functions when you stand up and venous blood pools in your legs due to gravity. The skeletal muscle in you leg will contract (even without moving your leg). These contractions put pressure on the vein walls and force blood back towards your heart.      I would answer veins...  good luck
AA11424478	Basically theres 3 types of soil. Clay, Sand and Loam. And how does these 3 types of soil affects water infiltration? As the name tells you, Clay soil are mostly made up of clay and  clay is very thick and dense. Therefore, it exhibits poor water infiltration. Sand soil are mostly made up of sand and sand being "random" in their sizes causes the soil to have large pores. Therefore, it exhibits excellent water infiltration. Loam soil are "balanced" soil which contains both sand and clay. Therefore, it exhibits the most suitable type of water infiltration, because water flows through the soil at a rate that the plants could take in the water.
rrndjXoOaa	Maybe, you should ask them what problems they have in any subject and give them paper work and help them through it so they will understand better. Many kids, including me, have a problem raising my hand and asking the teacher for help. I guess, it's because we're shy and all that. If they go to school and they get homework and if they don't understand it, you can help them through that too. My brother tutors my friend and he has improved a lot.|`|AA11424478	Well telling them to listen and read everyday ain't gonna help. What you want to do is motivate them and not pressure them, even though you meant well. You could ask them to tell you their feelings for the subject that they are under performing, that way you and the kids will know whats the actual reason for under performing. Tell them that math and science ain't that hard as they imagine, they just need to appreciate and befriend it. And when you do see improvements, make sure you acknowledge it. Small improvements will ultimately add up to great improvement! I hope this will help you motivate your tutees!

fdd19f6be025884e97942d805edfbe1daa	what, you talking about old-time purity laws, those used in Judaism etc? If you are, they're a huge set of laws for how the Israelites were to set themselves apart from the other nations, and live in a way that was 'pure' and pleasing to God.     EDIT: More specifically, you'd probably more be talking about things like ritual cleanness, where touching something ritually unclean (like something dead, diseased) would make you ritually unclean too. Priests in particular had to be aware of these things, as they had to be ritually clean - only in contact with things that were pure - at the time they entered the temple or offered sacrifices to God. They were particularly important because they did things like stop the spread of disease, and make the priests more aware of how special their duties were. I'd love to explain more, but too tired atm. You'd be better reading up on it yourself - there are lots of laws in Deuteronomy, and snippets in other places like Haggai chapter 2 and the Gospels (in the Christian bible)    There were other national purity laws that weren't necessarily 'sin', but weren't 'clean'. Like "Do not boil a calf in its mother's milk" or "Do not wear a garment woven of two types of cloth". These things weren't necessarily bad, but they were meant to be signs during daily life that would set them apart from the other nations, remind them they are different.|`|e1GCbGrXaa	German laws in world war 2 set by hitler that only pure germans like tall strapling blond blue eyes etc.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsge...
KVkU6WSpaa	The "year of Jubilee" happened every 50 years (some say 49 years) in the Jewish calendar.      The Jubilee year was to be treated like a Sabbatical year, with the land lying fallow (unplanted), but also required the compulsory return of all property that had been sold to its original owners (the family/tribe that inherited it originally) or their heirs (except for the houses of non-priests within walled cities), in addition to the manumission (freeing) of all Israelite indentured servants or slaves.    Hope this helps!

5oAU7S9zaa	Candy's dog symbolizes the journey all the workers have gone through, and in a way to me he foreshadows Lennie's death. Candy's dog also is symbolic of his love and friendship towards another animal. In a way, the useless old dog is a reflection of Candy and his old, handicapped state. The death of Lennie and Candy's dog seem similar. Both seem to have a test to spare the one's they love. Candy must spare his dog from the pain of staying alive. George must spare Lennie from the wrath of Curley.
sEDrP9uSaa	If you have to make and input-output table, than the easiest way to think of it is like this:  x's are the input, y's are the output.  So, just pick 3-4 inputs (usually 0,1,3,-1 and -3 are good ones), and substitute each on in for x in the equation.  Say you picked 3 for the input. 2x+3y=9 becomes:   2(3)+3y=9  reduce:  6+3y=9  3y=3  y=1  So for the input of 3, the output is 1 (or, when x=3, y=1). That gives you one point to graph: (3,1)    Repeat the process, choosing different numbers for the input (it helps to find ones that will give you whole numbers as answers instead of fractions). Graph each set of inputs and outputs and connect the dots and you're done :)|`|xmKBjEfIaa	you have to put it into y=mx+b format.  so change it to  3y=-2x+9  then divide everything by 3 to get y by itself.  then you get y=2/3x+3  you put your first point on the 3 on the Y axis  then go up 2 spaces and over to the right 3 and put your next point. then just draw your line thought it and you have it done.|`|rdgEAOHEaa	2(3)=6      +  3(1)=3    6+3=9    simple math|`|AA10439008	Make a table with 3 or 4 numbers for y, then put the numbers in and see what x is.

It shows they are doers, and not complainers, and get things done well. It shows they are hard workers, and strive to do their best. It shows they care about things which can effect them.  And alot of other things too. IDK if you are simply wondering, or if you're on the 2nd-side. And myself and tons of other people do not forget what we learn in highschool, especially if it's applicable to a job you want to pursue. I agree that colleges should base more on personality, not more than grades, but more than they do now.    And colleges want people who are likely to be successful at their college, and after college, so it gives both the college/person a fair trade (good education, for former alumni glory).|`|6252340d4daacca4ad2eae0dfba99d08aa	wellllll  i agree and i disagree  i agree because, some people like to relax durin highschool and people say its the " best time of your life "  can't really have the best time ever if we're always studying  but  i disagree becauseee  if you're really serious about universites and colleges, then you will study  or maybe its easy for you, and you grasp concepts quickly  its all because they're preparing us to be able to learn ALOT of infomation in a few short years  and how to apply skills and keep learning more and more things  essentially. yah..  so i both agree + disagree

If you're going for humanities, English will be.  Spanish and History aren't particularly helpful in college, unless you're planning to continue Spanish in college and want to get ahead.  History typically doesn't get you out of any requirements, even if you're a history major.  Same goes for Psych.    I find that a high score in AP English gets you out of the most requirements in college.  But it's not necessarily something you can study for.|`|TkYzkPHwaa	Since you're taking college level classes, you might as well get college credit for all your hard work.    AP English may or may not help you much. At my school, they only gave credit for AP Composition OR AP Literature, not both.    Because you are a native speaker, you should have no trouble placing out of your school's language requirements.    If I were you, I would focus on AP calculus the most, AP US history next, and then AP Psych third. Math is tedious, and history papers are time consuming. Psych is good to have out of the way but not as critical, AP English might be a waste of your time depending on the school you intend to go to, and you'll place out of Spanish regardless.|`|sWL0xxeraa	If you are okay on history I would suggest spending most of your time on calculus. Trust me it will benefit you in the long run....|`|e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	Just calculus probably, the other ones are more about homework than study

F4iXiZWUaa	Courage - more like a will power , the spirit from heart to go forward and do things.   even in simple things courage can be shown. not like you have to something big like save people from terrorists. even if you stare back at a person with will power and determination who is looking at you or your friend with a menace in the eye or some wrong intention thats courage.|`|Hrd9cCwPaa	Courage is when there are boundaries that have been broken.

C2XhUvo3aa	College is actually where I got my start as a firefighter now I work for the 4th largest city in Illinois.      Basically, Volly departments, especially those in the outskirts of college towns need people.  find out what departments are around your college and see if they have Part time or Volly positions open.  Most teachers are ok with you possibly having to leave (you're protecting their houses most of the time) and it gives you good training so when you get out of college you are one step ahead of the game.|`|fAcVndo7aa	If you're talking about being a career firefighter, it is very difficult to attend classes while working.  Two typical shifts are 24 on, 24 off and 24 on, 48 off.  This makes it extremely hard to schedule college courses.  In some cases, the department can make arrangements for you to be covered while in class, but it isn't guaranteed.  That's why a lot of firefighters take online courses.  It is more likely that they will accommodate your course schedule if you're working towards a fire science degree, but again, it's not a guarantee.    If you're really set on being a firefighter and taking courses, you could always volunteer as a firefighter.  Volunteer companies are usually grateful for your help, whenever you have the time to offer it.  Just because you're a volunteer doesn't mean you're not a professional - you just don't get paid.|`|5qdnePl5aa	you could be a volunteer firefighter thats when  you help the firefighters.  or you could apply to a firefighters place i forget what its called and show them your class times and theyt could schedual you around yoru classes or you might just have to wait till your out of college i do not recoment online classes their very hard and its hard to find the motivation and the time to go online and do your assignements i done online school and i dropped out and went back to normal school it was to hard if i wasnt working i was hanging out with my friends and i always told my self il do it when i get home or il do it tomorow and i always cam up with a excuse.|`|xcd9k8evaa	If you are a volunteer, you don't HAVE to be at every call. Just go to your classes and when your done then go to your calls. If you aren't a volunteer then I say make your schedule according to days off from the firehouse. Good Luck.|`|JciT1zNuaa	i am a career firefighter and the local community college has a fire science 2 year degree. they worked a schedule out where the classes are on a flip flop schedule where if the class meet monday it also met tuesday so that if the career guys couldnt come monday they could come tuesday. it worked out great because i could always make the class without missing days due to work but the downside was everyday you are off you are in class just about all day. if you are a volunteer that can make calls while you are not in class, weekends and nite. this way you can still focus on your classes.
jQjhIJzHaa	sin(A) = opposite/Hypotenuse  arcsin(opposite/Hypotenuse)=A    cos(A)=adjacent/Hypotenuse  sec(A)=Hypotenuse/adjacent    arcsin(x)=arcsin(x/1)  In other words, for an angle A, the opposite is x and the hypotenuse is 1.  According to Pythagoras,        adj^2+x^2=1       adj=sqrt(1-x^2)    so sec( arcsin(x) ) = 1/[sqrt(1-x^2)]
AA11604732	You don't mention if you want a Masters or PhD.    The better schools give financial aid to almost all of their PhD students.  Michigan is no exception.  If you apply for a PhD program, they will probably give you a fellowship or an assistantship.  These usually pay for your tuition and fees and also give you enough money for room and board.    Masters students do not usually get aid, other than student loans.    Good luck.

W1xs3vYBaa	Depending on what the IQ test was, a professional or online, it can depend. I'll assume that it was from a legitimate source which means that your daughter has a higher than average intelligence. Most IQ tests believe that you can increase your daughters IQ in these critical years and that your real IQ is formed at around 16. Still, it is quite unlikely that she could decrease her IQ so she will be probably have a higher IQ in a few years.     Most university students have an IQ of 115-130. Anything over 140 is someone who has superior intelligence and can go on to do any profession. However, the IQ score just means that she may have to work harder than someone who has an IQ of 140 but it doesn't mean that she should feel restricted in her future occupations.     Drive should never be underestimated and IQ cannot calculate that.|`|AA11815233	It's 17% above average.|`|2GOtFHzBaa	obviously|`|SbsB0bwEaa	i think i got around that too at the age of 19 lol|`|aGa29G1Baa	11? wow her iz smater thin meh.|`|xbzfRtpxaa	Average for an adult is just under, or around 100 (depending on the test, some have higher numbers you can reach or lower benchmarks)|`|cVbXmkk6aa	Well judgin by the fact that only a retard would ask that question...i guess your IQ aint very good.

K3YDHE2qaa	A scholarship, unless it is from the university, will be hard to come by due to the fact that you are not Canadian.  So I recommend you attempt to try to get one from your country or jump online and start looking for grants which being a Canadian is not a requirement.      As for cost, tuition will be contingent upon the university and due to you being an international student you are going to be subject to higher rates.  If you need to know the cost in USD, just visit www.xe.com, for a current conversion of the cost of tuition.    Also, you are going to have to pay for your visa, even if you are sponsored, health insurance, etc.  Other than that, at uni you will have your normal costs like food, books, any club dues if you decide to join etc.

AXiKJDV9aa	Those that I know went to graduate school to get work with decent pay and promotional opportunities (they did IT).  That was 25 years ago.  Now things are even worse - graduate school is pretty much a must to get a job better than entry level base grade at about 30K py.  And even then you are definitely no shoe in to get one - no shoe in at all.    Thanks  Bill|`|KrFT7KOjaa	The Unemployment Office.     I am not kidding, unfortunately.     I have an undergraduate, general business degree and it is USELESS. See, employers don't want to see an undergraduate business degree - they want to see an MBA.     So, after five years of unemployment after college I went to teacher's college and now I teach business at the high school level.

You can do nursing even in a community college which will be cheaper. Its 4 years by the way.|`|0mtzNHLSaa	Probably about 12 or more years.. It takes along time, plus hard-work and dedication.

5zhAdR1raa	Quality control - if the schools are in charge, they can make sure the curriculum is followed correctly and students get the required training in a consistent way.    Cost - not all families can afford private driving schools.    Accessibility - all students will have access to the program, not just ones with parents that are motivated and willing to make sure their kids do it - which will make kids safer as drivers in the long run.

Holding your pencil/pen properly.  Keeping the paper angled to your body.  I remember practicing continuous circles to warm up and keep our penmanship rounded.    It takes practice.

uC75y83Taa	Start by hanging around monster truck drivers.  Ask for a low-paying job, just to be around them.  That way you'll meet people in the business.  My brother wanted to be a radio disc jockey.  He got a job as a janitor, and stayed late and just hung around.  He made it big in Las Vegas, btw.  Good luck!  I hope your dream comes true!  :)
yp0g1E02aa	Equity suit: A suit brought for the enforcement or protection of a private right or the prevention of or redress for an injury where there is no plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. Essentially, judges were empowered to use equity or fairness to decide cases in which the law did not appear to address the issue at hand. Equity suits were abolished in Oregon in 1978.    ...for example, say you want into a country club that doesn't allow women, there's not a law for that, but you bring it to court...|`|aCllSulvaa	equity=fair    suit, as in lawsuit?

MPvYodKdaa	It's funny that people love to contribute unnecessary and inaccurate information, especially to the second comment, don't listen to her, she has no clue.    Being a President of a club really looks good on College applications, no matter what club it is, know why?  Because it shows leadership skills.  Having leadership skills is essential and Colleges loves to see kids involved in something like that.  You should be proud of yourself, because many Sophomore kids are probably just worrying about their grades, and forgetting about the extracurricular activities.      Also, the first answer is ridiculous.  Many public state schools don't even require near of what he has mention.|`|gTjtaG0Faa	Hip hop club?? NO the college's will think you a party boy, chess club, science club ect that they care about.  Also community service's help references from those places stating you were helpful, on time and committed really help.  Or a reference from your coach, -football, baseball, karate, gymnastics ect anything that shows you have extra things in life where adults see you committed on a daily/weekly basis and still stay on target with your grades.  Especially if you want into a top school.|`|zC7pkdK1aa	That will really depend.  First of all becoming a president of a club isn't that well rated as before.  Second, it will really depend on what you wish to do for the future. If you plan focus your career on music and attend an arts college, it will do a lot better than a business or engineering university.  Third, how good is your club? Have you guys won any state awards? (Regional doesn't help that much)  Fourth, GPA and SAT, I know you are saying you are doing very well, but you want a decent GPA and SAT for the administators to even READ your resume. Keep in mind you will have to average 3.8 unweighted or higher and 2200 SAT for top public universities. 3.8-4.0 and 2300+ SAT for privates. SAT II scores as well.      One more thing...  GO SOPHMORES!!  class of 2011!!!

4o3jaVHuaa	A.) Remember that quartiles divide the data into four parts. So half of the days (50) should have between 85 and 107 customers.  B.) By the empirical rule (68-95-99.7), three standard deviations are 99.7% of the data, assuming it's normal. So, using a calculator:  1 - 0.997 = 0.003, divide by 2 = 0.0015 (lower limit), (0.997 + 0.0015) = 0.9985 (upper limit)  normalcdf(0.15,99.85,97,12) = 0.593855  0.594 * 100 = about 59.4 days    ...I think.|`|0m5esQ1caa	A) since you have your 5  summary, you know that each of the quartiles contains 25 days. so in between the first and third quartiles (85 and 107) there are 50 days.    B) 3 SD's of the mean would from 59 to 131 which is also where 99.7% of all paying customers lye. So 99.7% of 100 days is 99.7 days, which is the number of days thath the number of paying customers was within 3 SD's away from the mean.    100% sure about the answer to "A"  but im about 70% sure about the answer to "B"
VjbhQE3eaa	Try organizing them by their subject. If it's an english anthology try listing it as British Lit or Early Shakesphere. Once you add it to your list then you can create a tab where you can always list all the authors who are in the anthology. hope this helps
