dQUISy3Haa	The Cherokee (1984-2001) was first and paved the way for the Grand Cherokee (1993 - current) and arguable the SUV segment. The Grand Cherokee was designed to be the replacement for the Cherokee, but Lee Iaccoa thought it would stand alone as an upscale model. The Grand Cherokee Has always been bigger, has more standard equipment, and offered more options (V8 engine, heated seats, etc.). The limited edition on both models was (is) the top of the line luxury editions. The Grand Cherokee offered special Orvis (ugly in my opinion) and Overland editions with special interiors.|`|Oliq3ZDnaa	The Cherokee is no longer manufactured.

You're talking about a single engine and with the extra weight she isn't going to operate as well as you might like.<br>  <br>  Look upwards to a 29'. The extra length and wider beam, possibly coupled with twin engines, will give you more comfort and a smoother ride. The cabin also will be larger and offer more amenities.

But at that rate, you might as well use any floor pan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, floor pans from all 1963 to 1966 A bodies (Dart, Valiant, Barracuda) will be the same (maybe 2 door and 4 door will be different, but you should be able to make them work regardless). If you can't find that, your second best bet would be to try making a '67-'76 A body floor pan work, as those should also be similar. In fact, they may very well be entirely the same, but I really don't know. They should still be close enough to work without too much effort.
32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	People prefer certainty to doubt.  Therefore, when they don't know, they speculate and pretend to know.

When you're in high altitude...you glide and fall slowly...but when you just took off...and get both engines failure, that's dramatic...so yes he was a hero and would have been even if some people would have died...because normally all die in these situations.<br>  <br>  When there are no known failures during the crash, no technical problems neither...but a weather situation difficult...then YES you blame the pilot or the first officer or both...dead people or not at the end. Why? Because he didn't react as he had too (for example switching on the anti-ice on wings at the correct moment) or other mistakes during approach...You know that if he doesn't descend within its "glide range", few meters above or below, he can be in a dramatical situation...|`|TdrgZwnoaa	It's the human condition; start pointing fingers at the people who cannot defend themselves before all the facts are in.

z7KhGeT7aa	you've most likely got a blown head gasket. you need to take it to a shop and have it checked|`|2k8TEiRtaa	You blew the head gasket. because it ran hot. there is a product called Blue Devil that says they guarantee to fix head gasket leaks. it is fairly expensive. But I would rather use that than have to remove the head gasket. And the heads may have warped. But it is totally up to you what you want to do. I hope that is all that is wrong with your engine.

Z13CWyNGaa	Be nice to know what kind of vehicle...<br>  Well are you going cheap? Legal? <br>  You can change the cams out that will be the cheapest most performance changing thing to do. You can also port the heads and even get stroker kits for some cars. Stroker kits increase displacement, more displacement more horsepower. Just keep in mind, if you change one thing, you usually have to change other things to see a real boost in performance.
Ty32khkaaa	The front axle is probably engaged. Try taking it to an empty parking lot and backing up for about 100 feet. That will often correct the problem. If that doesn't do it it is probably the module that controls it. They are not too expensive, maybe $100-$200.

Follow the instructions on the bottle or can. Then refill with oil and see if it clears out a bit. it is supposed to be brown in color. But the motor is pretty old and probably worn out a bit. But if it still runs good, flush out the motor.

Driving it in the condition it is in will likely make it worse.  The thing about cars is, when damage has been done to any of the wheels, axles, or anything internal, the car would suffer more damage due to driving it around.  Instead of waiting around or driving it, take it to the shop, have them inspect it, give you an estimate, and see if it fits your budget.  I guarantee you are better off getting the problem fixed rather than driving in poor condition.

r9H8AXIsaa	You would certainly have a "longer" run with it, not the quick start you would get with 3.35.  It's also a stronger gear that can handle higher torque.  Another benefit is you have a taller 5th gear than the 3.35 (not much though).|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Evidently the upgrade comes in having a trans that can take more torque through the gears.
fKVF8fufaa	Clean the area real good with some sort of degreaser or solvent (contact/brake cleaner works well). Take it for a ride stop and check very frequently to determine where it is coming from.  Another trick is to clean it and dust the area with baby powder, then ride it checking frequently, the oil wet powder just makes the source more visiable.<br>  <br>    Of course, you could just put a new crush washer/gasket on the drain plug and see if that takes care of business.
ivH8tRtsaa	No, it wouldn't damage the motor. If its running when it goes under, you may have to remove the sparkplug and dry it before it will start again. Boat motors are fairly resistant to water. Go figure! You can even sink a car and get it to run afterward.|`|EooU3QGnaa	I have done exactly that, and did get the engine going again right away and had no trouble with it, It was an old "Neptune".

If you put a safety chain from the motor to boat you have a good chance of saving the motor. Ive lost couple motors before and probably wouldn't have to this day if it wasn't fo the safety chain.|`|dKBE7Cf0aa	If your motor goes into the water you will need to get it running as soon as possible after you get it out.You will need to remove the spark plug and blow the water out with compressed air.You will also need to blow the water out of the electrical system.Then you will need to clean or drain the water from the carburetor.You will also need to drain and refill the fuel tank with fresh fuel.Once you have done all this your engine should start again.While it is running I recommend spraying some storage seal into the carb to lubricate the bearings and remove whatever water is left inside the engine.If you do this your engine will be fine.If you leave the engine without getting it restarted,it will start to rust inside very quickly.Then it's only good for an anchor.Hope this answers your question.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	If fresh water and not running> pull the plugs pull threw drain the carb> Spray down with a good corrosion block and try starting>|`|WhBc23VBaa	the out bord is mostlikly held with a clamp it will stay on <br>  but if you get wattern in it it is bad|`|BarjvQpTaa	It would sink, they don't float.|`|96vocRwBaa	yes you would lose your motor

lc1Fm7zJaa	Well, your distributor can't be the stock breaker point style and  really be able use or benefit from that coil (too much juice for the points and must add extra ballast resistors). An upgrade to a  H.E.I. type distributor has probably been installed at some time in the past. Keep in mind that no coil, box, or distributor is going to add Horsepower or Torque...they can't, it is impossible. The 1967 GTO with the 400 cu. in. / 335 HP engine, # 670 heads (72 cc chambers, 2.11/1.77 valves), the 9786286 intake manifold and the 9779066 cam was a masterpiece of Pontiac engineering. I would highly recommend Jim Hands book "How to Build Max Performance Pontiac V-8s" to you. It is the Holy Bible of Pontiac Muscle Car enthusiasts and owners. There you will find track tested and proven advice, tips and techniques. Much better than listening to suggestions from somebody that wouldn't know a '67 GTO if it ran them over in the street.|`|AA12095978	both!<br>  <br>  The distributor won't really give you more power, but it'll look awesome under the hood!<br>  the MSD box, will give you 3 sparks per cycle, so you'll definetely feel the kick of the MSD box.|`|AHygXkmfaa	If you really want to make more power, you need a camshaft and some good cylinder heads. If you're running an automatic, you really need to put a shift kit and a smaller torque converter in there. If you get that done, and you don't have a posi rear, then you better get one, along with some drag slicks, because you'll need it. <br>  <br>  If the distributor you are looking into, replaces your mechanical points type distributor with an electronic ignition unit, then it's a nice upgrade, but probably won't net you a noticeable difference.

f915b96cf0e8a3afb012b1b833b05df8aa	whats the question. all I seen was a bunch of toy cars<
ivH8tRtsaa	Sounds like belts to me. It could be loose or worn out. Make a visual inspection of the belts. Replace any cracked or frayed belts. If the belts are in good shape, adjust the tension(tightness) of the belts. If your not that mechanically inclined or do not have the money to repair it right, any auto parts store sells this stuff in a spray can that you can spray on the belts. This stuff makes the belts tacky in order to grip the pulleys better. Using this method can greatly reduce the life of a good belt. Hope this helps.|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Loose alternator drive belt.|`|QzAdWvW0aa	It probably is a belt. Here's an old trick I still use today if I have a multi belt system. I get my self a can of WD-40 with the stem on it. I have my wife start the car then I keeping my hands far enough from the fan and belts so as not to get tangled  in them I spray a little shot of WD-40 on the rear belt being very care full not to get any on the others If it`s the one that's squealing it will immediately stop. When you spray the one that's causing the noise it will stop and you will know which one to adjust or replace. Also don`t try this with out a pair of goggles covering your eyes. You won`t get that crap in your eyes but one time and you will have learned your lesson. I have found that on those old 72 models most of the time if they have A\C that is generally the beltthat'ss loose, or frayed or full of cracks.|`|cvtYbKXXaa	Sounds like the fan belts for sure.  I had a Hyundai that screamed bloody murder until it got a little warmed up.  It was embarrasing!  I used some spray you can get at the Auto store, I think Wal Mart carries it too.  That worked for awhile.  The belts stretch and get loose sometimes and need to be tightened.  This requires moving a pulley they are wrapped around (the pulleys are set so they can be moved for just this reason).  The belts also wear out.  Open the hood and look at them very closely.  If you see small cracks in it, they need to be replaced.  You sure don't want to be driving down the road and have one break on you.  Then the fan wouldn't turn, the engine would heat up really bad and that could warp the metal in the engine, destroying it.  Very, very bad.  good luck!|`|oE0ApHqPaa	My old car did that (also a Buick, but a 1982 Regal.  Yay Buicks!) and I had loose belts, I think going to the alternator.

QzAdWvW0aa	It is common for rookie mechanics \ oil changers to accidentally knock a vacuum line loose or off a fitting, which would cause a lean situation in your combustion chambers and a hesitation and loss of mileage. I would first look for a hose disconnected and while I was doing that I would also look for any cracks in the hoses. Any air leak in your vacuum hoses will cause your engine to run lean and to hesitate. If al looks well then I would next check the sensor that monitors the incoming air, most are in the o hose just behind the air filter box. Just one piece of lint or debris can cause your air fuel mixture to be wrong and consequently throttle response problems. <br>  <br>  But a good rue of thumb is any time your car has been running correctly and some one services it and then it starts running badly, the first place I look is where they worked. I go over every inch of where they have been with a fine toothed comb. Ninety nine percent of the time I find the problem. If you still can`t locate the problem then you need to have it put on an analyzer so it can be repaired. Any lean fuel problem can burn pistons and valves in the head ( s ).|`|z7KhGeT7aa	try the fuel filter if you didn't have that changed. i didn't see it in your question so that would be the first most simple thing to try then post back if you still have the same problem<br>  <br>  kevu and ky have good points too especially if you took it to "Iffy" lube|`|WhBc23VBaa	sum thing is bad with your fule managemint system im think maby a bad spark plug or coil pack,injector|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi<br>  You not in that bad of shape.

PAceoX2oaa	Your best bet is to replace your 7-bolt block with a 6-bolt block. There's a bit of work involved in making the swap work, but it'll assure that crankwalk won't happen to you in the future. If you must, replace your current block with another 7-bolt block.

sCqdisvnaa	All are differences of size, and price.  Going along with that is that the larger cars are typically heavier, with more standard equipment, and often (but not always) more powerful.<br>  <br>  The 3-series is BMW's most popular model, and is regarded as an entry-level luxury (or near-luxury in industry verbage) car.  It is the benchmark for competitive compact luxury sedans such as the Audi A4, Mercedes C-Class, Infiniti G35/G37 and Lexis IS-series.<br>  <br>  The 5-series is the next size up, a mid-size luxury car, and competes against other luxury sedans such as the Audi A6, Mercedes E-class, Infiniti M-series and Lexus GS models.<br>  <br>  Finally, the 7-series is BMW's full-size luxury car and competes against other large luxury sedans such as the Audi A8, Mercedes S-class and Lexus LS models.<br>  <br>  The essential difference between the BMW 740i and 740iL is in the wheelbase of the two cars, with "L" designating long wheelbase.  There are minor option differences between the two cars, as well.  I'm assuming you're looking at the 1994-2001 E38 7-series models with this question.  One of the biggest differences, for example, is that while there were supposedly Sport models of the 740i and 740iL, the iL version did not have the sport suspension and sport transmission of the standard wheelbase model.|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	The difference between the 740i and 740il is that 740il is longer but same engine.

Along with the increase in interior space.<br>  <br>  and the difference between the 740iL and 740i, is the 740i is the sedan series, for like a "family" package, the L means Luxury, this car is more for driven in, than driving.|`|880ec6527fe04278aef13b29d116c9d7aa	Price, price and price
WhBc23VBaa	you cant really adjust the pads but you can replace the pads ore calipers|`|0efdb09e1638363fed9f8404e8a84c77aa	you can't adjust disc brakes.<br>  <br>  If you have drum brakes and the car was made after the mid 1970's the rear drum brakes should have self adjusters. To adjust these you back up slowly pumping the brake pedal as you drive, releasing it completely each time. The self adjusters turn the adjustment ratchet out 1/16 of a turn each time the pedal is depressed. When the rear brakes are fully adjusted the self adjuster will no longer turn until they need adjusting again. This only works in reverse because the front shoe moves up slightly to activate the adjuster. <br>  <br>  If your car doesn't have the self adjusters then many of the other posts have accurately described how to manually adjust the brake shoes in drum brake assemblies. You CAN however, buy the self adjusters for about $10 a wheel. They're are simple to install and worth the effort.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Below is a link that confirms what I have written|`|2k8TEiRtaa	if you have a car or truck with break SHOES. Not pads. They can be adjusted. Using a small wheel notched devise at the wheel behind the drum. It is adjusted by tightening the brakes all the way , then going back 14 notches back. First check if the brake shoes are not worn down to the meatal or almost to the metal.|`|QzAdWvW0aa	You failed to mention what year and make of car you have. However, if you have disk brakes in the rear you can`t adjust them. If they are drum brakes you need a tool called a brake spoon. Some flat tipped screwdrivers will also work in place of the spoon. But, even if the rears are shoes, they should be self adjusting. You shouldn't`t have to do anything to them other than replace them when they wear out. <br>  I do not want to sound mean but, Brakes should only be worked on by specialist's as peoples lives are at risk. If you have to ask the question that you just asked then do your self a favor and take your car to a pro. You are not a specialist.|`|fDDgFrtNaa	unless your car is very old, it should be able to adjust itself, regardless of whether it has drum brakes or rotors. sometimes, however the self adjuster on drum brakes can get stuck. its easy to free though.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	If they are disc brakes then there is no adjustment.

When the a/c kicks on you can listen under the hood to hear of the clutch is engaging on the compressor-you will hear it click. If it's not then you need a compressor, if it is engaging then you may need a new orafice tube or condensor. It's hard to tell exactly what you need without hooking up the gauges and reading the pressures. A/c repairs can be costly and you are better off taking it to a shop and paying to get it diagnosed. You may need a compressor and a condensor or you may just have a simple leak in one of the lines. It's hard to tell without having the readings.

Don't race the engine or cause it to stall.<br>  <br>  BRAKING Bring the vehicle to a stop gently. Start braking well before your stopping position to avoid "jerky" stops. Make sure you stop your vehicle in the proper position of the lane.<br>  <br>  CLUTCH/GEAR Always be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. With either an automatic or a manual transmission, shift into the proper gear at the right time without "grinding" the gears.<br>  <br>  SPEED Obey the posted speed limit, of course, but also adjust your speed properly due to weather, road, visibility and traffic conditions.<br>  <br>  FOLLOWING DISTANCE Keep an adequate space "cushion" between your vehicle and those you are following. Use the "two second rule" described in the Driver's Manual. Be sure to increase your following distance in poor weather or visibility.<br>  <br>  TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES Know the meanings of signs, signals and pavement markings, and obey them consistently.<br>  <br>  STOPPING POSITION If a stop is required, stop your vehicle before it reaches an intersecting street. If stop lines or crosswalks are present, stop before crossing them. If your view is blocked after stopping behind the crosswalk, move up until you can clearly see your way, then stop again if necessary.<br>  <br>  LANE SELECTION AND POSITION Keep your vehicle in the proper traffic lane, especially when preparing to make turns. Don't allow room for another vehicle to pass you on the side that you are turning toward.<br>  <br>  COMMUNICATION Let other drivers and pedestrians know which way you want to go. Use your directional signals or horn consistently and at the proper times.<br>  <br>  OBSERVATION Look for and identify potential problems or hazards in the traffic around you - not just straight ahead, but behind you and on either side. Check your mirrors frequently, but be sure to look over your shoulder behind you when changing lanes or backing up.<br>  <br>  ANTICIPATE & REACT TO OTHERS Anticipate possible driving errors by others and be ready to react safely to make up for their mistakes.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	The best drivers are usually those with good hand-eye co-ordination, and those who are decisive.  <br>  <br>  Drivers who dither often get themselves into accidents 'should pull out? oh another car, should I go now? oh, oh OH, now I've stalled in the middle of a junction.

Knowing where the ends of your car actually is and how far it takes to correct for things like brake distance, steering away from something, ect.<br>  <br>  <br>  A simple way to learn where your wheels are, is to save all those soda cans. Find a big ole parking lot and set up a can somewhere on it. Get behind the wheel and driving slowly try to crush the can with the cars wheel. Remember to pick your cans up when your done.<br>  <br>  A good way to practice where the front and rear of your car actually is... is to get a rubber maid trash can that you can easily see above your hood. Going very slowly pull forward until you nudge the can. After you nudge it back up and try to get as close to the can as possible without nudging it. Put it in park and check how close you are. repeat for the back.<br>  <br>  <br>  To practice braking, using chalk, draw a line on the parking lot, call this the stop light. Practice stopping behind the line, the goal is to come to a complete stop behind the line without making your passengers or yourself jerk at the end of the stop. Keep in mind that when you double your speed say from 30 to 60, you increase stopping distance by as much as 8 times.   So if you are going 30 and it take 50 feet to stop, at 60 it could take you 400 feet. While most cars will stop faster than this always allow yourself the extra room when possible to apply your brakes and be sure they are going to work. Nothing like going 60 and waiting till the last second to stop only to find out you don't have any brakes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ceghY57uaa	The Pass Plus course is a voluntary one and is already available to anyone who has passed their driving test in the last 12 months.

f33xIzFWaa	if you are sure that it is the timing belt, the issue could be quite serious. i have heard that a timing belt breaking could ruin the engine but not always. sometimes it just breaks and the engine is okay. changing the timing belt could run anywhere from 500 to 1,000 dollars depending on who fixes it. it is costly because it is a pain in the butt to do. i have a 96 galant that needed a new timing belt so i changed it myself which i pulled the engine out of the car to make it easier to get to it, and it was not a fun task. my local mitsubishi dealership's service dept had the lowest price for changing a timing belt on my car so you might want to check yours if there is one in your area. the only way to tell if it did not hurt the engine is to have a mechanic inspect your engine for internal damage. any car that has a timing belt should be changed at the manufacturers recommended interval to avoid engine damage.  i say this because everyone will tell you something different. some people will tell you to have the timing belt replaced at 60,000 miles and some will say 100,000 miles but i would trust who made the car before i would someone at a local autoparts store. i hope this info helps and i hope you can get back on the road soon with your car|`|5CvocInQaa	If you haven't messed anything else up then around $500 or more.

I just sat in one at the auto show and was shocked to see how bad the right rear 3/4 view is.  The blind-spot from the C-pillar is huge.  I didn't pay close attention to the size of the right-side mirror but you definitely have to make sure it's positioned properly because otherwise you can have a Hummer H1 drive in your blindspot and you probably wouldn't see it.  That design is definitely style over function.<br>  <br>  "Feel free to explain why you don't like it or defend your idiotic opinion if you do".<br>  Are you saying that my opinion is idiotic if I do not agree with your opinion?|`|dQUISy3Haa	If you don't like the style of the new Camaro, that's okay, its not your cup of tea. That doesn't make it stupid. Variety of expression in design allows many people to participate in the auto hobby. Given the problem GM has is with profitability, the new Camaro and their other new cars (and current models) need to sell well and be reliable. GM produces and offers a variety of fuel-efficient cars and trucks. By the way, GM produced V6 engines (see Buick Grand National 1987) producing 300+ hp over twenty years ago.|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	I never liked the Camaro to begin with, now it looks like a cartoon of it's self.<br>  Every bad feature exaggerated!<br>  It was ugly to begin with, but now the complete ugly forest has descended on it and imparted ugly to the max!|`|4KF2cZWkaa	no. they look too played out. ugly.|`|uy4k4OlNaa	I think its ok.

328e52056e90a15c3247940d35d04602aa	So its not reputable as u incorrectly assumed. <br>  <br>  Either the salesperson lied or misunderstood the deal. Either way its not his decision to make.

You are just used to dealing with the lower end of the profession due to your credit issues. Nothing is firm until it is approved by a dealer and the lending institution. They say what they think you want to hear to aid in making the deal. It sounds like you need to improve your credit, save up some money and then go to somewhere other than a buy here pay here type lot.|`|bssOhC9jaa	What did she say?|`|NlYGbqnkaa	This deal isn't up to the salesman or the manager. They can agree to sell the vehicle for whatever price but ultimately the financing decisions come from the bank. The salesman, sales manager, and finance director really can only guess. It may be an educated guess based on your credit report but often they miss things and need to submit the deal to the bank. The bank will respond and tell the dealer what the rate, term and amount to finance will be. The dealer in this situation isn't anything more than a messenger. The salesman probably said a bunch of things then was told differently by his boss. Most likely it wasn't done to intentionally mislead you but an honest mistake. Remember they don't usually want to jack you around they only get paid if they sell you something and that won't happen if you feel like there lying to you.

AA12261615	a brake caliper sticking on one will cause it and so will a tire that's out of round or has broken belt in it,and most alignment shops wont check the tires unless they suspect one of being bad,you might want to have them check the tire for a broken belt,good luck.|`|Htv32zN6aa	It's actually suppose to be a safety feature on all cars, vans, and trucks.  However, it is actually suppose to pull to the right not to the left (so you don't merge into on coming traffic.)  However, you didn't mention anything about tire pressure.  If your tires are lower on the left than they are on the right this could cause it to pull. If this isn't the case, you can also use tire pressure to fix the problem.  You might be looking a shifted frame which is common with older cars.  If this is the case, it is only bad for the aerodynamics of the car (such as gas mileage.)  Check your tires :)|`|yzZchHHTaa	Check your air pressure in your tires, especially front.  If the left is lower than the right, it will pull left.  A bad strut will also make it pull, and yes a wheel bearing will make it pull too.  Just because it does not make a noise, the wheel bearing may still be bad.  Jack up the tire on the left side and wiggle it and check for movement in the wheel bearing.|`|IYGcehKLaa	pulling right is usually normal but pulling left not too good i would check your tires and the amount of air you are running in them it seems if your alignment is on the only thing it really can be is you tires or tire pressure|`|EMC7JwVBaa	A low tire will pull the car to its side. make sure the tires are properly inflated to correct pressure.|`|BXKtPk2laa	Cars are not supposed to pull, don't listen to Alianna. They often seem to pull to the right because roads are crowned, meaning they are higher in the center for water run off and such. Only things I can think that make it pull, you say have checked out. Bad tire? Alignment?|`|09TUzWtmaa	a bad tire can cause a vehicle to pull even if it is rotated to the other side. try rotating tires front to rear and see if there is a difference.|`|xL6zhYthaa	Hi, if you want to get more information about it, go to <a href="http://car-engine.synthasite.com/?q=car%20pull" rel="nofollow">http://car-engine.synthasite.com/?q=car%...</a>|`|zOIgzIy4aa	a low tire can do it. even a bad shock or strut. if it does it when you hit the brake then a caliper hanging up can make it pull.
JeUvm9NIaa	The effects are soley for groundspeed and ground roll to reach that speed.<br>  Since Vy and Vx are based off of Indicated Airspeed, or the speed of the relative wind, this number does not change due to the speed off wind. <br>  Since Vx is usually used for a short field takeoffs, the wind may decrease the ground roll necessary to reach Vx, or lack of wind may increase ground roll making the short field takeoff longer, preventing clearance form the obstacles at the end... Thats why a full t/o performance calculation  based on temp and wind needs to be calcualted for each flight.|`|nRCqF6Euaa	All V speeds including Vy and Vx are calculated using indicated airspeed ( IAS ) only, of which  wind is not a factor.<br>  <br>  Therefore the simple answer to your intelligent question is " None "<br>  <br>  To paraphrase a previous answer, wind may well effect when you attain a given Vspeed but not the speed itself.|`|KSUPtqCaaa	There is no effect on Vy or Vx, or on any airspeed for that matter.

The wings do not "know" if the wind is blowing or not.  They just know what the relative wind is.  Your groundspeed will be affected by wind, but your V-speeds do not change.

Some look like they would be rather fun to drive. but a different kind of fun from the classic muscle cars.  Not only that but there is also the "do something different factor" Go to a cruise night a see the same old camero and mustang but how many 69 hondas do you see?   I could see myself buying one if i could find one in decent shape for a decent price.  personally i think i would take a 66 mercedes.<br>  <br>  no as far as price no i really don't see them selling for more than a muscle car but i really don't care.  Im the hobby for the joy it brings to me and my family  not the dollar factor.<br>  <br>  I will also hand it to the owners of the imports on thier ingenuity and hard work.  I know parts are hard to find.  but i have seen a few nice ones here and there.  you can basically get everything you need for a camaro or mustang shipped to you over night.<br>  <br>  bottom line is i love all classic cars no matter what the make or model or country of origin. but i am rather partial to my pontiacs|`|1Bmo1JsYaa	There is no comparison between these cars.  The GTO is valuable and will remain so, the Celica has very little following that year and while it would be a curiosity, you would have more fun in the GTO if you can afford it.|`|HwUfcYsAaa	Go for a little Detroit Thunder.  Classic Imports are like old tin cans.  Not much use for them.  Classic Muscle cars are worth more money, sound better, and are much sexier than an old rice burner.

lOKXW3Icaa	depends on track conditions,weight,landscape. usually about 80kms per hour, slower if the have passengers|`|o3Z0Xrjsaa	Most trains if on  the prairie are aloud to go 70mph but usually no faster. In city it would mostly likely be 25-35mph which is still fast for train. Bullet trains in Europe can travel up to 125mph+ and Japan up 170+mph. While going down hills trains are suppose to go no faster than 25mph or even slower as the brakes like on a car can burn out and become useless leaving the train a runaway which has happened 2 or 3 times on one specific stretch of track in California, causing major derailments that have damaged or destroyed houses and railroad tracks and the Bridge in the area blocking the line for days.|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	The maximum"authorized" speed is the target.  It is different for each train, depending on that train's particular make up, including total trailing tonnage, tons per operative brake and the amount of dynamic brake available from the locomotives, as well as other restrictions posed by grade territory operations.<br>  <br>  "Track" speed is just that, no different than a speed limit sign posted on the shoulder of the highway.<br>  <br>  Lastly, some equipment has speed restrictions placed on them.  By way of example, air dump gondolas are usually restricted to no more than 35 mph.<br>  <br>  All of these things are taken into account by the crews when assuming duty, and it is their responsibility to determine what the maximum speed is for the train they are on.  In addition, if the train's make up is changed en route, any changes that further restrict speed must be observed.<br>  <br>  The gentleman above is quite correct, as freight locomotive "over-speed" is set at 72 MPH.  But, the reason why is gear ratio.  Most road engines have a 62 : 15 gear ratio that allows a top speed of only 72 MPH.  But, passenger locomotives are geared much higher, allowing for higher speeds.  They are not handling much tonnage when dealing with passenger equipment, so the higher gear ratio has little effect on their pulling power.|`|fKpBXXJbaa	Depends on design speed, signalling, track conditions, etc. The Pendolino trains on the UK's West Coast Main Line were designed to run at 140 mph, but it was too expensive to upgrade the signalling to allow them to run that quickly, so in practice they're limited to 125 mph. French TGVs, German ICEs, and Spanish AVEs routinely run at 300 km/h / 186 mph on their new high-speed lines, slower on older lines.|`|b69e65b2010abf344db1a751bcdb379eaa	For most freight or intermodle trains top speed is 70 mph and that depends on what the track speed is where they are at.

The right thing to do would be to take it in and pay to have it fixed, if you dont have the knowledge to check it out. Another (wrong, but will work) option is to install a battery cut-off, they arent expensive.they install on the battery cable and are basically a switch.easy enough. <br>  However, you say it dies randomly and needs a jump to start.

bMW1u8DSaa	Honestly you have nothing to be nervous about. I was honestly really worried about driving with my instructor for the first time too. I didn't know who I was going to have as an instructor so that added to my nervousness. Your instructors are going to naturally be very serious in the classroom about driving. When you get behind the wheel with them though, they are going to do everything in their power to make you feel comfortable while driving. I don't know how your program where you live works. With my program, you need to do 6 hours of behind the wheel instruction with one of your instructors. After that you are eligible to take your road test to get your license. During my first 2 hour session, we did the basics. Left turns and Right Turns for 2 hours straight, never going above 20 miles an hour. The second 2 hour session, we went to the town that I would be taking my test in. We drove the routes they might take me on. And he showed me where the DMV was. I also have to go driving tomorrow. And we are going to practice Parallel Parking (very easy done it a few times) and 90 Degree Backing. Honestly don't worry about it. The first session, you are going to learn the controls of the car and get out on the road for a while to practice turning and maybe doing lane changes. But that's about it. They might go over your road test requirements too. You have nothing to be nervous about. The instructors are going to be there in case anything happens. They will make you feel calm and relaxed.

AlJrVK8Gaa	It depends on your skill and how much power the car has.  If you are a competent driver who knows your way around a stick and the car has under 400 bhp, then you should be fine.  Your bf is just jealous that he is not getting a Supra.

AA10712251	Most of the cameras are placed in areas where their primary prupose is to entrap motorist. They may occassionally save a pedestrian but more than likely it will only fine an unsuspecting driver that went 5 miles over the speedlimit.

I think a manual 5 speed is about all you need. Six speeds (automatic and manual) are out there also. At least in some cars.<br>  But I want a clutch and a shifter, it just that a stick shift is hard to find in some cars. The auto makers need to certify emissions and fuel economy for the fleet averages and automatic transmissions are more consistent from one driver to the next. So they just don't make as many of them in most cases.|`|R7uCC0Dgaa	there still popular, but popularity has gone down, one reason is people are doing so many other things while driving, i.e. talking, eating, tending to kids ect. so it's harder to do such with a stick, <br>  <br>  another reason is people drive a lot more and there are a lot more drivers, sticks are not fun in stop and go driving, suck actually<br>  <br>  i drive a stick, but i also have an automatic that i drive when i know i'll hit traffic somewhere, only problem with that is going to put my foot on the clutch out of habit when i'm driving my auto and in turn slamming on the brake lol <br>  <br>  sticks are way more fun though, easier to control your speed, just more fun, you really feel more like your driving, if that makes sense|`|wd9EPcGWaa	I would rather have a stick|`|zEJuKS90aa	My preference is a manual over an auto any day of the week..just depends on you...its not abnormal, and not to mention you will get better gas mileage than an automatic|`|xXdMgGDKaa	No a lot of cars are stick, it's all personal preference. It's not abnormal. :]|`|W7IKifoEaa	Not as much, but yeah they're still some people that drive cars with stick shift. Preferably sportier cars.
g4vPxFCbaa	It should be 4-door, 4-cyls, not sporty. I would prefer Honda or Toyota... First time drivers usually have much more expensive car insurance, and it depends from car.

RWjvcCYoaa	No problem. All the dealer has to do is input your home address with zip code and the software will charge sales tax for your county, not for Berkeley Ca. <br>  <br>  You can get a one way pass so you can register the car in NM instead of CA. Then you'll only have to pay your state's registration fees. But a one way pass means you have to drive straight back home. It's not good for driving around CA while you're visiting.<br>  <br>  So you can either wait until you're ready to leave to buy the car. Or buy it while you're visiting and pay CA reg fees. Once you get home, you can re-register the car in your state and NM will give you a refund of the fees you paid in CA.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Yes, you can. You pay sales tax based on where you are registering the car, not where you buy it from.
v8TWvtQgaa	You can stroke it, but for stock type crank you only have 1 option. Then you will still need custom made pistons <br>  <br>  1955-67 used small journals. Rod journals was 2.00", mains was 2.30" <br>  <br>  68 up used larger journals. Rods are 2.10", and mains are 2.45" <br>  <br>  The 283 was only made as a small journal engine and it had a 3.000" stroke with a 3.875'' <br>  <br>  The 1962-67 327  had a 3.25" stroke which was the largest stroke crank chevy had in the small journal engines<br>  <br>  A 3.875" bore and a 3.25" stroke = 306.6 cid <br>  <br>  Bored .030" over with 3.25 stroke = 311.3 cid|`|dQrBlk4qaa	I believe you'll end up with a 307! The 307 is a 283 bore with a 3.25 stroke (if I'm not mistaken). I also think that's the best you can do - try to source a 307 crank since you may have issues finding a decent crank, given the small crank journal size on the 283. If I were you, I'd keep that vintage block as a 283, and push for about 300 horsepower with a good set of ported heads and intake. You may have to wind it up a little to get that power out of it, but still, it's pretty cool to hear that old engine hit those rpms. <br>  <br>  You may also want to research the possibility of fitting the 305-sized vortec style heads to the 283. The bore size will work, and the flow will be much better than the best heads back in the day. The only problem there is the need for a vortec-style intake.|`|wOQifWRdaa	the 283 has a short stroke, IIRC the crank was the same used on the 1969 302 chevy making it a real high rev engine, so if you want to turn this engine that hard I would focus on ignition, valve train and intake and exhaust, otherwise I would choose a larger engine to start with if you were after torque instead of top end hp|`|11zjz8WQaa	youd end  a 307 i think or something like that    thats a real small engine tho i would focus on the ingition ehaust and cam shaft
5JI64hBnaa	He's right, but working with fiberglass is not easy and it stinks to hell. Definitely not an indoor project and I'm assuming it's cold where you are too. I'm not trying to knock you, but getting a nice fiberglass box is not easily achieved as a first effort, especially if you intend to paint it. Wrapping it in vinly will allow you more room for little imperfections.<br>  <br>  If you do proceed, use fleece from the fabric store and spray glue to mold your shape. Keep in mind that the fiberglass resin will release the glue though, and the shape will sag somewhat once resin is applied due to the weight. It's possible, but you might want to try some smaller fiberglass projects first to get used to working with it. There is definitely a learning curve. <br>  <br>  Did I mention that this is definitely NOT an indoor project?<br>  <br>  Check JL audio's website. They used to have pictures and I'm assuming they still do.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|U99DiQEZaa	you need a fiberglass kit....you have to make your box from wood and then cut little pieces of wood and a ring....then you can put the wood pointing at a angle and the ring slanted and then apply your material on it and paint it and then you should have a unique box like you want...

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	Yes you need an interface harness/module for that car. There are a few different ones available depending on which factory stereo you have and depending on rather or not you want to keep the door chime feature in your car and if you want to retain the availability of the On-Star system if your car has that feature as well. There are 4 different types of systems for that car, a factory amplified system with On-Star, a factory amplified system without On-Star, a non-amplified system with On-Star, and a non-amplified system without On-Star. Go to the link below and enter your vehicle information, then use the drop down menu to select "Harnesses - Into car" to view the available interfaces for the particular factory system you have. You will also need an antenna adapter and a mounting kit which can be viewed by selecting the appropriate category in the drop down menu.

AA10249078	You are a very lucky person.  The kind of injuries you sustained can require months of healing before you will feel like yourself.  Some of the injuries may require a limited level of activity for quite sometime.  Discuss your concerns with your doctor and listen to him/her. While you may feel like you are ready to go back to school, doing too much too soon could actually delay your overall recovery time.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may agree to let you return to school on a half-day basis just to see how you do. You may find that you are so exhausted and hurting after a half-day's return that you will be happy to allow your body the time it needs to fully recover.<br>  <br>  You are to be commended for wanting to get back to your normal routine. Occasionally someone will be so traumatized both physically and mentally by a car accident that it takes months or even years after the body has healed for the mind to heal. PTSD can be a real problem for many car accident victims.<br>  <br>  As far as a cheap way to thank those who helped you?  A card would probably be the cheapest way of expressing your thanks. You could send a single card to the entire group (which is really a very impersonal way, and not recommended). You could just as easily get some personalized thank you notes and write a unique note to each person who helped you.  If you can make mention of a particular moment that you recall of them helping you, it will show that you really do appreciate what they did for you.<br>  <br>  If you spent time in a particular section or floor of the hospital you might want to consider sending a lovely thank you bouquet of flowers to the nursing staff on that floor.<br>  <br>  Good luck and get well soon.|`|AA12041870	With all those problems, you may not be back to school for a long, long time.|`|B1iJTtUbaa	that is def a question only your doc can answer, feel better soon!|`|gaWZ79gNaa	you should be happy you are alive, but I will be more than happy to listen to you vent!|`|35cOQFIDaa	thats something you should ask your dr.|`|PvV0aNvfaa	whats your name?

Q4O1v13Qaa	Converting the fronts to disc is a very popular swap for A-body GM cars (Chevelle, LeMans etc.). The cheapest way is to find a donor car in the junkyard. You want to change everything between the ball joints. The main thing is to make sure the knuckle/spindle is good, as you can easily find cheap replacement rotors, calipers and hoses. Any later model B-body car that has the same size ball joint tapered portion would work. Looks like 1970 might be the last year, but check with the counterman at the junkyard. <br>  <br>  The rear discs would probably require a kit, which are available, although more expensive, as they were never available on those cars. You're also going to want to get the Master Cylinder and Proportioning Valve from the donor car, or if you do the rears too, an adjustable proportioning valve. Also, if your car has manual brakes, the addition of a Power Booster is highly recommended, as discs require more hydraulic pressure to operate.|`|elfAmParaa	There are several companies who have Ebay stores that sell complete disc brake conversion kits for old Chevy's.

AA11264416	its because some people just assume its hard, it takes practice to drive a stick, you can't learn in just a few minutes, but then once you learn how to then it becomes real easy and second nature, a lot of girls also don't have patients to learn how to drive a stick, they get mad if they can't get it right after about 20 minutes and give up, but i learned it pretty fast compared to most people, after an hour i got it to where it wouldn't cut off and then about 30 minutes later i got it so it wouldn't jerk anymore, after that i was still a little rough for a little bit but it wasn't bad|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I tell people that I learned to drive on a farm tractor and the first thing they say is ""I didn't know tractrors had automatic transmissions.""

AA11264416	well i think its because people now a days would just rather have an actual convertible than T-tops, i personally would want a T-top, i hate convertibles, the whole convertible set up makes the car heavier than a coupe, like the convertible version of a car is heavier than the coupe version, and also a convertible has no roof protection if you flip or get in a bad wreck, at least with a T-top you have some protection, and actually T-tops don't leak any worse than a convertible, but im not to sure, the camaros and firebirds still could come with T-tops so they still have them if you look|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Because they are dangerous.|`|OtvkADSCaa	In the 1970s, convertibles stopped being built because car manufacturers were told the government would be requiring tough, new rollover standards for all new cars.

When they are in the paper for over $4,000 they sit for a long time. When they hit $3,500 they tend to be gone right away. If you are in the market for a Sportster, the $3,500 is a really good price. If I was selling one, I wouldn't sell it for $3,000 either. If it's nice and clean and it runs well, it would sell for $3,500 all day long. If you can get it for $3,000 then good deal for you! I just wouldn't wait too long and expect a good clean Sportster to sit very long at $3,500. <br>  <br>  Low mileage can be an issue, but if it runs right and isn't leaking oil from the forks or engine, it's probably fine. If that is original rubber, I would probably consider new rubber even if it has plenty of tread. Eight years is too long to leave tires on a bike. <br>  <br>  I would go for it. <br>  <br>  I loved the Sportsters I had, and I would add one to my collection again in a second.
WVyWefA1aa	Well, the car itself, if well taken care-of, should technically be fine. However, you need to ask about the mileage on it, and it being an economy level dodge, I wouldn't rely on it if it's below 90,000-100,000 miles. Your work commute is kinda far, but if it's only for a few months, I think you'll be fine.
RbsRpcIyaa	Varies from lender to lender. <br>  <br>  Usually, the lowest they'll even consider is $1500/month. They will definitely take a look at your income/debt ratio, so if you make $1500 a month but have a $750 rent payment, don't expect to be financed. <br>  <br>  The current credit crunch has really changed the ball game, however. So, expect quite a bit more scrutiny no matter where you apply.
z7KhGeT7aa	change the pcv valve  are you 100% there are no oil leaks with that kind of mileage. you gotta check underneath. oil pan gaskets, front and rear seals, valve cover gaskets. see if you have oil in your air filter if so change the pcv valves first and see if this helps|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	"1/2 - 3/4 of a quart of oil a month" - without knowing how many miles are put on it each month, it's difficult to say. If you are using 5w30 oil, for instance, you might significantly reduce this usage by simply switching to 10w40.<br>  When you have your next oil change, have the mechanic carefully check it over for any leakage. Odds are, if there are no leaks, the consumption is a combination of valve seals and ring wear. I certainly wouldn't get overly concerned with this amount of oil usage at this time.|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	look for leak|`|Ty32khkaaa	If it is not leaking or blowing smoke the only thing I can think of would be a blown gasket. It is likely leaking into your cooling system. Probably a blown head gasket, but it could be an intake gasket. Both are common on cars with high miles. Also take a look at your valve cover gasket, if that is leaking the oil often gets burnt off when it drips down on the the exhaust. You will see fresh iol on the head just below the valve cover gaskets.|`|CIR768SAaa	yep, check for the oil pan gasket, see if ur leaking.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	loosing this much or little oil is not noticeable from the tailpipe|`|AA10084083	depending on how many miles you drive in a month, 1/2 quart is not excessive oil consumption.

All said I still prefer the design and innovation.|`|AkHzDZDOaa	the new 9-3s have a very long warranty that will generally cover everything that can go wrong for the first 50K miles.  just make sure you change the oil with synthetic every 5K at the most and the car will last you for a very long time.  The factory recommends 15K but that causes the sludge build up and excess wear on the engine and turbo seals.  The engineers are on crack, no car can go for more than 10K w/out an oil change especially a turbo.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	Generally, yes.  They say they get shitty as they age though.  The big thing that has plauged their history is oil sludge problems, which usually leads to more serious engine problems.  One main cause was their unusually long oil change interval, I'm told.  Regardless what Saab recommends, I would do oil changes at 3k and use synthetic oil (especially turbo models).  The turbo models are a thrill to drive (i've driven one, simply amazing)!|`|g4vPxFCbaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

9dca1dd5e42bcda99289c2be71202077aa	Best thing to do is swap out the 3100 for a 3800 and then get a manual from a 4 banger grand am around the same year as the 3800 you get (if you do this) and then send you ECU to DHP and have them flash it as an manual and then you will need to get a wire diag to hook up a shift light, right now you at 3 grand if you find Your parts cheap ... add on the ecu cost your at 3200 est. then axles and custom headers for the turbo, but IMO get a SC 3800 you can do alot with them and they make really good HP numbers..www.3800.com<br>  www.dhp.com also check out gaowners.com there you will find more.and can help you out.. also you might want to look up on gaowners site my friend bigstribs he would love to helps you out.<br>  <br>  in all you can do it if you have a budget.. i guessing 5 grand if you spend your money right.<br>  <br>  Well if you need more info email me.,|`|fPBeY5Uzaa	around 50 large not a bad price for the power tho.|`|8zVxYkluaa	LOL, you will NOT get 400 horsepower out of a 3.1.<br>  <br>  It's a Grand Am, not a hot rod...if you want power move onto a real car, seriously.<br>  <br>  The 3.1 is not, and never will be a motor that makes big power, it's not intended for that and there's not enough aftermarket support to even come close to making that kind of power.<br>  <br>  Let's say hypothetically that you could get close to that power AND convert it to an manual...you're talking gobs of money....for the amount it'd cost you could probably buy 7 or 8 '94 Grand Prix's lol|`|39ixfEIraa	ok first off its  a 3.1 V6. A turbo charger will cost about 5,000$ easy. already tripple wat ur car is worth. 2nd the manual will cost you about 4 grand so thats 9 grand. If you want to stick with pontiac(good cars) than buy you a 1999 Grand Prix GTP. It is about a 5,000 car. Equiped with 240 horse power. U put a a charger in the 3.1 you might make 200 horse. So now you have 240 horse and it cost 5,000(or less). Put on a K&N filter, u may add 10-15 horse. So ur at 255 horse for a price of 5100$(or less). Next get you a nice exaust system( a couple hundred) which will ad maybe 20 horse. You are 275 horse for about 5300$. If you wanna keep going you could get some headers which would cost maybe a grand and add 30-50HP. so your talking potentially 325 horse power for about 6300$. to save alot of money on manual(im sure u want it) but with these cars it would be worthless, i would suggest getting a shift kit. Basically you can click a button and it will give you a quick take off, also it will allow you to change gear ratios for different set ups. about 1000$. So now you have a 7300$ car that will be alot faster than the grand am. it will have 325 horse which is nice. that would save you around 2 grand on wat u would do the the Grand Am. Also you could just save all of that money and spend about 8,000$ on a 04' gxp that comes with 305 horse, but i like the 99'  GTP i have on my self they are nice. Top it off they are much niceer than the Grand Ams. GOod luck

Not a big deal to replace.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Did you put the coolant in the reservoir or in the radiator ? If you put it in the radiator, you have to bleed the system of air pockets that may keep the coolant level low, to bleed the cooling system , you fill the radiator with coolant, then you run the engine to operating temperature. You then look for a bleeding screw that is located at the thermostat outlet on the thermostat housing. Turn that screw counter clockwise until only coolant come through and the air is out of the system. If that does not work. replace the thermostat. But bleed the system after you refill.|`|fDDgFrtNaa	the thermostat is probably stuck open and letting your coolant flow through freely without first heating the engine up to operating temp. changing the thermostat is a pretty cheap, easy fix. you just need to remove the upper radiator hose and theres the thermostat. you might consider flushing the radiator while you have it open if you havent in a while. good luck.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	when you put antifreeze in it was it over a gallon low? you may have a leak, check for leaks, if none?<br>  start and run it for 20 minutes, open hood and touch the radiator at the top, it should be just hot where you can touch it for 5 -10 seconds only,<br>  if cold it is most likely the thermostat that needs replacement|`|ktMefP0oaa	If your van warms up to  operating temp, and your fan comes on, the only thing it can be is either your heater core is stopped up, (unless you put a bunch of stop leak in your radiator not likely) or you flap under the dash in your heater box is not opening.|`|Ty32khkaaa	My guess is that the thermostat is stuck open.

AA12377112	Good friend of mine got his about a month or two ago and absolutely loves it. Then again he only drives high horsepower v8's. I would buy the 6-speed SRT myself, but I've all ready got a Charger. I'd say the bad part is you'll end up wanting to spend more money on upgrades, but otherwise they're reliable cars and the only problem I've had with my charger (basically the same car with 4 doors) was the interior fan started to squeal so I had it replaced at 30,000 miles.|`|R7uCC0Dgaa	buy an 07 WRX or STi, you'll be MUCH happier|`|AoNBI840aa	Well, you wouldn't buy one for the fuel economy, or the small size and ease of a ride.

morGmsELaa	Since you are implying ANY car for $70,000 or less, I'm going to have to opt for a used Dodge Viper SRT10.<br>  <br>  Yes, one can purchase a used SRT10 on eBay for under $70,000. There have been reports of a used GALLARDO being sold for $75,000 with 1500 miles on it.<br>  <br>  Why not a Corvette C6 Z06? Simply because everybody else has one. They are much too common and their exhaust note sounds much like to that of a diesel's. The Z06 might be faster around a track and have a little bit better gas economy, but the SRT10 is much more uncommon and in my opinion, much better looking.<br>  <br>  Take mine in black with smoked tailights and blackout Enkei rims. :]<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|M79W3Ct9aa	It would have to be the Subaru Impreza 22-B coupe in the oh, so famous WR Blue Mica.

WO68RZdIaa	You will need to go to court most likely & possibly even sue the dealership for the impound fees since it looks like the dealership failed to submit the required paperwork to DMV showing that you did purchase the car & to transfer the title over to your name. <br>  <br>  An attorney may be better to assist you in this matter than trying to fight this by yourself. Yes it will cost you money, but there is a lot riding on these charges by the police & you will not be able to recover the vehicle from impound until you can prove to them that you are legally the owner of the car. And all the time, that car will continue to be racking up daily impound fees while it sits in impound. The attorney should be able to get it so if you win, the losing party has to pay all of your impound fees, and attorney costs.<br>  <br>  You may even try Googling the name of the car dealership to see if they pop up in any of those pissed off consumer blogs that are becoming very popular online (like <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ripoffreport.com</a> for example)<br>  <br>  Does the car have a decal or plate that says where you bought the car? If so, the police may have had problems with that dealership before doing some shady or possibly even illegal sales transactions & due to those past problems decided that impounding the car was the safest route since there was no way for the officer to prove that you were the actual owner. <br>  <br>  Even if the officer did a VIN check, if the dealership failed to submit the paperwork to DMV to update the legal owners info to yours, that check would still come back to the previous registered name on the title & would not match your temp registration paperwork from the dealership or your insurance certificate & personal identification. In that respect, the officer was doing his job & you may not really be able to show fault on the officers part.<br>  <br>  After reading and re-reading your information above, I get the feeling that the police has had problems with that dealership before. You yourself even said that the Manager of the dealership is "acting very shady".<br>  <br>  My suggestion still stands- you need to contact an attorney.

eqZE40YLaa	If you still owe on your car, your bank will need to provide a release letter allowing you to ship it outside PR.  If you're credit isn't great, this will be tough to come by.  The reason - they can't repo it if they are in PR and the car is in the US (or vice versa).  Keep shopping around looking to re-fi the loan, including trying some banks in the States.  Many banks will let you apply online.  It is entirely going to depend on your credit though.  Still no luck - sell or buy the car where you're going to use it, get another one on the other end.  As you also may know, shipping and import/export taxes aren't cheaper - you're probably better off selling whatever you have on one end and buying something else on the other.

E0j6mhqhaa	First off, cam chains are endless and unless you break the chain, there's no way to change it without pulling the engine, splitting the cases and removing the crankshaft.  If you could find a master link of the correct size, you'd have to grind the ends off of an existing link (being careful to not let the grindings fall into the engine), press the pins out, attach a new broken chain to it and then pull the old one out while feeding the new one in.  With worn guides, there's always the chance of a master link being popped off resulting in a destroyed engine.<br>  <br>  That said, the chances of your cam chain being worn is about as likely as winning the lottery.  Why do I say that?  You can measure the chain length and at 105,000 miles, my KZ 1000 cam chain was still in great shape.<br>  <br>  There's several things that can cause your problem.  The top idler sprocket between the camshafts on the early '79s would fail and a revised replacement was made available.  Mine conked out at around 35,000 miles.  After removal of the valve cover (made difficult because the loose sprocket lifts up), it was easy to find that problem.  The cam chain tensioner itself may be at fault.  <br>  <br>  The first series automatic tensioner ('79-80) uses a spring, a shaft and 3 steel balls.  I never had problems on my 1000, but the same tensioner on the 1300s was the cause of a lot of bent valves and junked bikes.  On the 1000, one way to overcome that was to remove the little short bolt form the side of the tensioner, turn the engine over by hand with the valve cover off and when you were sure the chain was tight, screw in a longer bolt of the same diameter and thread pitch.  The tensioner is no longer automatic but neither does it loosen.<br>  <br>  Now for the bad news.  There's a small L shaped chain guide in front of the crankshaft below the cylinder block.  Mine broke off and I first found it when it came out while draining the oil.  This will let the chain strike the case up front and it will knock small pieces of aluminum off.  I don't know what the long term consequences are, but I too had a problem with a loose chain, thought it was the tensioner and rode the thing for probably several thousand miles before I found the guide.  <br>  <br>  Replacing the guide requires removing the carbs, exhaust, cylinder head and cylinder block.  There are several rubber rollers that help tension the chain and after much uses, mine were hard as rocks and coming apart in chunks.  If you tear yours down, you better consider the possibility of needing to replace those as well. <br>  <br>  If you're handy with a wrench and can read a shop manual, you will be able to change the guide without too much expense.  Head gaskets are expensive, but you might be able to find OEM on ebay or aftermarket much cheaper than through Maw Kaw (if the still carry them that is).  You'll also need exhaust header washers and probably a valve cover gasket.  Consider removing the rubber cam end plugs in the head and coating them with silicone sealer before replacing the valve cover.  When you split the cases, there's several little bitty rubber blocks on the camchain guides you don't want to lose when you take it apart.  If your bike has low miles, you can probably get by without replacing piston rings but if high miles, you should and rings are expensive.  Me?  I replaced my engine with an '81 rubber mounted 1100cc.  It works great but certainly isn't a job for the faint of heart.  Good luck.|`|72ddVB2iaa	FUNNY!<br>  <br>  Me and a friend had an old Honda apart tonight for base and head gaskets. We didn't use the wire. We used this stiff waxed sting stuff to fish the chain through. That first answerer had it 100% right. It's a cheap repair and if you do it right, that old Kaw can run for a long time. If you try to cob it together, that engine will eventually end up as junk. <br>  <br>  Plus, when you do work on things like that, it feels really good to have done it yourself. Ask around in a classic Kawasaki site and you could even end up with someone volunteering to help you. I have had several offers of help, advice, and assistance from the Buell site I am a member of. <br>  <br>  Real motorcyclists will always help another motorcyclist if they can.<br>  <br>  Edit: Not all timing chains are endless. In fact, in my limited experience, none of the ones I have seen have been that way except the ones in cars. The one I took off of the Honda had a standard master link. You tie a piece of string or wire to one and fish it through to put it back on. Anyway, I wouldn't try this without a service manual and that will let you know what type you have.

bqLvWpcZaa	The new GLK is a very nice vehicle.  I have admittedly only sat in it but I was impressed with it.  It is also based on the new C-Class ( which is a fantastic car to drive ) so I'm sure the driving dynamics are very good as well in the GLK.<br>  <br>  There are other vehicles within the same class of smaller-luxury SUV/CUV such as the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Range Rover LR3, and Volvo XC60, just to name a few, that your friend may want to take a look at as well and compare.

Your sister may have blown it from cranking it up too loud but the problem is more likely that you have too much amp and not enough sub. Replace the sub with one that can handle the amps power and not the same kind you had before or turn the amp down or replace it with a smaller amp after you get a new sub. I wouldn't blame your sister because if the amp and sub were properly matched up to begin with and the gain/level properly set she wouldn't have been able to fry the voice coil. That's the whole purpose of properly matching the system and correctly adjusting the gains.|`|EGEOOZLXaa	The amount it would cost to fix it yourself would exceed the amount of just simply buying a new one - which is usually the case with electronics of any kind.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	You should give her a swift kick in the ***.

It has the highest mileage, so rule it out. The benz is kinda for old people. You're young, you need something that looks young too. Do you want something old rich people drive, or something young rich people drive? The Audi or the Jeep are your best bets.

I will probably obtain a whole bunch of thumbs downs for this statement but.. Audi's engine have frequent breakdowns and very high replacement parts. However, it has quite strong skeletal structure which will be evident and helpful in a car crash. The A6 is also pretty uncommon, so there's another pro to opt for the Audi.<br>  7.5/10<br>  <br>  Let's skip the Merc for later.<br>  <br>  The Jeep SRT8 can work both towards your favor or against it. It can accomplish 0-60 in 4.6 seconds. This is faster than a BMW 335i, Chrsyler SRT6, or even a WRX STI. This car is easily the fastest car out of your four. However, the cons of this car easily outbalance the pros of this car. The engine, like you state, is MASSIVE. This will lead to poor gas economy, frequent oil changes, etc. Jeeps are notorious for being uncomfortable, having noises as if something is broken, etc. Blame old American engineering.<br>  6/10<br>  <br>  The last two cars are the Range Rover HSE and the E350. I PROMISE you that if you purchase the Range Rover, you will regret even contemplating about buying such a superfluous piece of crap. Terrible gas mileage, lopsided style, and average performance for a bucketload of money. Worse bet here.<br>  5/10<br>  <br>  The 2007 E350 had a style redesign, and in my opinion, is quite voluptuous. The Mercedes might be quite common, depending on where you live. It is very comfortable to be in, has ample performance, and has a lot of technological accessories that can be quite useful. <br>  <br>  8.5/10.<br>  <br>  Opt for the E350.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|y4xFNvBaaa	audi

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	You are going to get two very different sound from those two setups.  The ported enclosure is tuned low which will mean you will get good sound quality and decent output.  A bandpass enclosure will give you some output but only in a narrow frequency range, like said above.<br>  <br>  The pros of a ported enclosure is typically more output but worse sound quality.  Typically a bandpass enclosure will give you even more output but in a small range of frequencies and not good sound quality.  I say typically because it matters what subs you are using.  <br>  <br>  Forget the 3db or any numbers when it comes to what a ported enclosure can give you compared to a sealed or bandpass.  The truth is that every setup is different.  There is no set value of how much a ported enclosure can increase your bass.  You can make a ported enclosure that gives you a 10db increase over a sealed enclosure with the proper sub and enclosure specs.  Similarly, you can have ported enclosure that actually gives you less output then a sealed enclosure.  <br>  <br>  Many subs don't work well in bandpass enclosures.  These subs can actually give you less output then a ported design or the frequency range is so small that there is no point in choosing that design.  Obviously the subs you are looking at work fine in a bandpass.  I'm just saying that the 3 to 12 db increase is false.  You can get that much of an increase in a small range of frequencies but that is not a guarantee.<br>  <br>  In order to decide which setup you should go with you need to identify what type of sound you are looking for.  If you want output and sound quality is not as much of a concern then go with the bandpass.  If you want good output but better sound quality then go with the ported enclosure.  As I said before, the two you are comparing are pretty different in terms of sound.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|5JI64hBnaa	A ported box gives about a 3db increase around the tuning frequency.<br>  <br>  A bandpass gives a much higher boost like you say, but it is at a FAR narrower frequency range.<br>  <br>  If you value sound quality AT ALL do not use a bandpass. Go ported.<br>  <br>  If you want the most boom so people will look at you, go bandpass.<br>  <br>  Of course you have to use subs that will work in each enclosure. Not all subs can be used (well) in any type of box. <br>  <br>  Note: I've never seen a manufacturer give a recommendation for a bandpass box. Why? Because bandpass boxes make it VERY EASY to blow your subs if they receive frequencies below the tuning of the box. My buddy used to go through subs all the time with his bandpass box. It was loud, though.

You can use line output converters on the high level outputs of the head to convert them to RCA's then you will be able to use the 4 channel amp retaining the ability to fade and still have the heads RCA preouts to use for a sub amp.|`|5JI64hBnaa	You can, but I wouldn't personally. RCA signal tends to be better quality than speaker-level signal. If you tune your system right (headunit equalization, amp gains, crossover points (if they're variable)) you can get great sound off of splitting your RCA signal with Y's like you say. I've always done my systems this way because I didn't want to put a lot of money into a head unit. <br>  <br>  Hi-level signals will be a little muddy sounding. Some people won't be able to tell the difference, but I always could...unless it was my imagination....|`|ivH8tRtsaa	Absolutely. Just make sure you ground the amps as far apart as possible to prevent engine noise. Wal-Mart also sells an inexpensive RCA cable splitter. This allows you to run as many amps as you wish off of the same RCA cables coming from your radio. Hope this helps.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	The basic comment is that what is installed will be removed and new or newer units will be installed. There are some older radios that have "slide in replacements" but most will require a new "tray" which is the mount, wiring, and radio.<br>  <br>  The basic requirement is for communication and an encoded transponder. In most cases you will want more than that but that is the basic need.  The good news is that since lots of aircraft are upgrading to full GPS systems there a lots of inexpensive but still very good nav/com units available on the used market at very reasonable prices.  A good nav/com with ILS will run your about 3000 or less (installed),  a comm unit only installed is around 1200-1500. A good transponder with encoder can be done under 1000.<br>  <br>  We just upgraded our Comanche and the old radios (which were good) and worked well were sold for 1000 each, you will need to add for installation.<br>  <br>  --Add--  <br>  I have seen King KX155's for under 1700 add a ILS indicator for around 500 and add installation.  You can find some good Narco 12D units for 1000-1400 etc.  New transponders can be bought for 900-1200 if you want a new solid state unit. Older units are around for under 500.<br>  You can do some online shopping at <a href="http://www.avionix.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.avionix.com/</a><br>  or <a href="http://www.bennettavionics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bennettavionics.com/</a> or even better <br>  <a href="http://tradeaplane.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradeaplane.com</a>

addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Evo X and STI are main competitors. Audi S4 or RS4 is a luxury performance AWD sedan. The RS4 is a little faster. The S4 is about the same as the STI and Evo X.

mTwn8p79aa	It's probably the water pump.  It isn't usually the impeller that goes bad in car water pumps (unlike boat water pumps.)  It's usually the bearings that fail, that's probably the squeaking you're hearing.  This is usually accompanied by a slow leak out of the "weeping" hole in the water pump.  When the bearings fail the slide instead of roll, this causes heat and that causes the seal to fail and that allows water to come out of the weeping hole as a tell tail that you need a new water pump.|`|WPYjdsA4aa	sounds like the waterpump isnt pumping right replace it

6xyeYjkkaa	Without a car they can't quote you a rate or sell you insurance. It's based on the type of car and written against the specific car not the driver. Test driving the cars is fine as the owner should have it insured. Then when you find the one you want to buy take the information to an agent and purchase insurance against it in your name.|`|AA11914369	To begin with, if you don't have a car, you can't get insurance on a car, since it goes with the vehicle, not with the driver.  So if you are test driving, it's with the owners permission and you're covered under his policy.    As to the second part, where to go when you do want to get insurance and are buying a car:  You walk into the office of any local independent agent, and he will be able to assist you.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Many dealers may have an insurance agent on premises who can sign you up when you buy, but you'll have to find one who can.  Otherwise, ask the dealer is there's an agent nearby who can sign you up to make you legal.  I did this a few times when I shared a building with a used car dealer--one-stop shopping.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	A - without a car to start with, you would have to buy a non-owned vehicle policy.  Such policies are normally sold as short-term full coverage for rented vehicle, or as commercial policy endorsements.  B - state minimum liability is garbage for coverage.  It doesn't even give enough to cover the damages if you were to write off somebody's expensive vehicle in an at-fault accident, and heaven help you if you injure a young surgeon with a family to feed.    I carry minimum $1,000,000 on my car, and I am retired, only driving a couple of days a week.  We carry $5,000,000 on my wife's car, as she drives a long sales route several days a week, obviously higher exposure.  Do like the rest of the world does.  Buy your vehicle, and take the paperwork to a broker to buy your insurance.    Please ignore the poster who says to drive the car home without insurance.  If you have an at-fault accident, you will be sued plus you could write off your own car, leaving you thousands of dollars in the hole.  If you are stopped in a spot check, your car will likely be impounded for no insurance.  Officers do not have the option of letting you drive on even if they ticket you, as they then would have assumed financial responsibility for an accident you may subsequently have.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	I don't know of any company that will issue you a policy without knowing what kind of car you'll be driving. How could they?    Some auto dealers will make you buy insurance (from the company of your choice) before you leave the lot, I guess it's a potential liability for them. I ran into this and it was annoying.    Private sellers, on the other hand, don't generally care if you have insurance. Once they have the money and sign over the pink slip, it's not their problem. I wouldn't worry too much about driving a car home un-insured and arranging a policy once you get home. They will generally take effect the same day or at midnight the following morning, so the chances of you having an incident in that few hours is pretty slim!    If you're truly paranoid, call the insurance company of your choice from the seller's location before you leave and buy a policy. It only takes about 10 minutes and they can arrange it to be effective immediately and fax/email you the insurance docs. This is what I did at the dealership. As a side-note, I've generally found that calling the company is faster than trying to do it online. Just a tip.    As for the amount of coverage, I'm not sure I understand your complaint. I had no problem buying a "legal minimum" policy online from Geico. If you're having issues with the internet sites, pick a company, call them and state that you want a "legal minimum liability-only" policy. Yes, they might try to sell you more coverage because that's what they're in the business of doing. If you don't want it, don't buy it.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Some insurers sell a Non-Owned Automobile policy, however this policy is expensive and is hard to find. It is meant more for chauffeurs, vehicle movers or people who generally make their living driving vehicles they do not own but do not qualify for a garage policy (you wouldn't either). You will not be able to find this type of policy online but will have to contact several insurance brokers in your area to see if they represent a company who offers this. beyond that there is nothing you can do. You need a vehicle in order for an insurer to issue a policy. Besides, it's the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the vehicle is insured. so if you're going to test drive a vehicle and you cannot provide a police officer with proof of insurance for that particular vehicle you will be charged with driving without insurance (even if you had a Non-Owned Vehicle policy). If you decide to purchase a vehicle take all of the vehicle information to a local insurance office nearby and purchase the insurance then. DO NOT DRIVE WITHOUT INSURANCE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Ignore any idiots who say to take a chance and drive without insurance for a couple of hours.|`|pposouLYaa	autoinsurance.undonet.com - try this one. I personally have their car insurance, cause it is the cheapest for me in our area.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	As others responded, you cannot purchase minimum liability insurance without a car.  The cost of the policy will be based on the specific vehicle that your purchased, as well as other information such as how much you drive, where you live, your age. All carriers will let you customize your plans.      I believe that the state of CA has minimum liability limits of 15,000 per person for bodily injury / 30,000 max per claim and 5,000 for property damage.  As you might notice, $5,000 for property damage is almost nothing.  And if you get into a moderate accident, it is almost guaranteed that you will exceed your policy limits.    When you purchase your new pre-owned vehicle, the dealer that you are working with may have sourcing to provide on the spot insurance coverage.  This is usually fairly expensive.  You can also purchase insurance on the spot over the phone or through the internet with such carriers as Progressive, esurance or GEICO.  I suspect that based on your questions and situation, those three carriers are the most likely to provide you with an affordable insurance quote.  There may be other carriers that provide "instant" coverage over the phone or internet, you need to do your research.|`|BPuyPpNkaa	Your best bet is probably Geico.

lM9NvSwnaa	Depending where you are, there is a great place to go to see all the bikes from the major manufactures, but alas most of the shows are over with for the year.  The Cycle World International bike show.  It cost $10-$15 for a ticket, but you will have a chance to see all models from the majors.  You get a chance to sit on, test feel the bikes etc.    Of course if you want to go used, then start shopping the local papers and ebay or Craig's list for your area.    I generally recommend for entry level bikes something in the 400-600 size range.  All the japanese manufactures  made them back in the 80's.  The reason why I recommend used is that WHEN you drop the bike and you will, you will not be nearly as upset as dropping a new one.  Possible models to try and find, Kawasaki EN 454 LTD, or 500 LTD.  Kawasaki 450, Honda CM 400 and 450, Suzuki and Yamaha also both made 400's or 450's.  These were all twin cylinder fairly narrow motorcycles with reasonable seat heights-under 30 inches.  There engines are bullet proof meaning they will run virtually forever with minimal care.  They generally have right around 10,000 on the odo's and can be had all day long for right around 1000 dollars.     No matter what you decide we need more women riders out there.  It is not until our numbers come up that the manufactures will really take notice to our special needs.|`|AA10582974	Not to be stereotypical, but don't most women like to window shop?  Go to different manufacturer dealerships and look at bikes under 600cc for a first bike.  Sit on them to see what fits.  Talk to the salesman and ask what they recommend.  Then try to find a used one, no need to buy a brand new bike to learn on.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Well, I'm 5' 6" and and have a lot of lean muscle from growing up on a farm.  So, I'm not weak by any means.  My first bike wasn't really suitable for me (Suzuki GT250) because it was too small, but it was easy to learn on.  After that, I rode a Yamaha 650 Heritage Special.  It was nice!  It was light enough that I never ran the risk of dumping it over if I had to stop unexpectedly, and there wasn't a lot of plastic on it.  It's also easy to ride, and shifting isn't a struggle, nor is kickstarting (though it also had an electric start, I prefer kick starting).  As a matter of fact, even though it is completely a street bike (not meant for riding off road), I used to take it riding out in the field just for fun.    If I ever get another bike, it will be either another of those, a Yamaha Virago, a Honda Goldwing, or maybe a Sportster.  But, I haven't ridden in a while, so I'm not sure what sizes I would go for, because each size/cc of bike varies a bit.|`|AA10346371	People come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.  So do motorcycles.  I suggest going to several motorcycle dealers and sitting on a few bikes.    Checkout how the bike feels to you.  Sit on it long enough to really check out the seating position and ask yourself a few questions.    Can I put bot feet flat on the ground comfortably?    How is the seating position?  Do I sit too far forward putting too much pressure on my wrists?  Do I sit too far back?  Do I have to reach too far for the handle bars?    How is the foot peg position.  Is it comfortable?  Is it too cramped?    Does the bike feel too big or too small?    Then you have to ask yourself some other important questions like can I afford this bike.  Will it be so powerful that I will be afraid of it?  Will it not have enough power and I will get bored of it too soon?    You may want to buy a used bike first.  You will make mistakes learning to ride.  Most people will lay down their first bike at least once.  Would you rather lay down your nice shiny new bike or an older used bike.    After you have your used starter bike you ccan sell it and put the money towards a new bike.  If your starter bike is well maintained and not abused you won't lose too much money when you sell it.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	I give my vote to the Suzuki SV650. it is fairly light and not too tall. The basic SV does not have a fairing - or a very small fairing. it is a V-twin so it is also narrow. Very dependable engine. it is no slouch on power - about 65 hp - but that does NOT put it in "crotch rocket" (100 hp) territory. there is a sister bike SV650S (sport) which has lower bars and a half fairing - but it sounds like you don't want that. you should be able to buy a clean used one several years old - for 3-4,000 (or a new one for 6-7).|`|fl60KL8oaa	You sound like someone who does not follow the drummer, nor the beat of a different drummer, but instead wanders off doing her own thing not caring what others' think.  Suzi S40, under 400  wet, will do 85mph, will run away from others at the stoplight.  Rocking chair cruiser ride.  Often cited as a beginner's bike, I can vouch from four years+ ownership it is also a keeper for those who don't have a need for illegal speed.  Very easy bike to mold to your own image, be it bagger or bobber or tourer.    If you want something with a standard seating position, the Triumph Bonneville looks interesting, bigger than most would recommend as a first bike.|`|e6793d500dfaf665df5882dcbf7f1223aa	why not go visit your local harley davidson dealer .

My wife got a Rebel 250 for her first bike. It was only 3 yrs old with less than 4000 miles on it for $2000. I have a Nighthawk 750 1993 model, and I love it. I will upgrade to the big Shadow eventually. They also make a Shadow 750 which you can get pretty cheap as well. The Hondas are half the price as a Harley, and are just as good (probably better).

Get at least a 600cc up to a 900cc. You have to go to a dealer and sit on them and you'll find the one you like.  You need something that will handle good in crosswinds on the road. Light bikes do not enhance the riding experience/confidence when they get blown all over the lanes.|`|lSLoY2x5aa	I just taught my wife to ride my sportster.  Now she has her own sportster 1200.

Maybe $500 for just tires, another $200 for oil and tune up, but it's a keeper unless you know there's something that's gonna break soon.  I used to think , 20 years ago , that spending $500 a year on a used car to maintain it wasn't bad.  Now that number might be $800 a year, but you're still ahead of the game compared to the cost of a new anything.  Treat yourself to a $200 wash and detailing, maybe drop $1000 next year on a paint job.  Pretty soon it will be a classic and worth $10,000.   lol|`|WPYjdsA4aa	about 50 bucks for the oil change and good tune up   around 150 to 200 for good tires   my brother has one and it is a great car keep it|`|bfa542a41113a06bd1000a3f8b1b90b7aa	$550.00|`|j2gjD2NOaa	You have had your moneys worth out of that  car get a new one .

I7NkFJo2aa	Yes.  By this year model it would be a fourstroke I think from memory.<br>  <br>  It needs the starter motor assembly, the regulator/rectifier - I am not clear on if the stator has the charge coil in it as standard (wouldn't think so)  so that may be an issue if your engine was not fitted with that.  The next link has various diagrams of the parts and assemblies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.brownspoint.com/df9.9/999703.asp" rel="nofollow">http://store.brownspoint.com/df9.9/99970...</a><br>  <br>  1-2 32120-93E20 Battery Charge Coil part no.  This is apparently the one used for electric start 9.9's, the other may have less output.

Part of the regulator diagram.  <br>  <br>  Mostly it is pretty straight forward - the first thing is to identify the parts your engine requires, and go from there.  If you are not confident with the mechanical stuff it might be best to get a qualified person, or workshop to do the work - that way you get a warranty too, you won't get far if you fit the bits yourself and stuff it up or find a problem later and seek redress.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Contact Suzuki and ask the parts department as it also needs charge coils to charge the battery> Have your model #
SOfbIOzUaa	In 2004 the Accord had a timing chain instead of a belt.<br>  In 2006 the Civic went to chains instead of belts.<br>  The CR-V has had timing chains since 2002.<br>  All vehicles with a V6 engine still have belts.<br>  <br>  Older vehicles with belts called for changing the belt every 90,000, 105,000 or 120,000 miles unless the vehicle's use was classified as severe in which case it would be sooner than that. Even a chain could eventually cause problems especially when you have it in a car that runs forever. A chain would cost a lot more to replace but because it last so much longer there is no time recommended top change it.

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	Power inverters are not made for audio applications. AC current produces RF and EMI noise that will interfere with audio signals. You can try making sure that all audio cables are routed away from all power wires. Keep power lines as far away from audio lines and sources as possible. Use very high quality audio cables. Make sure the inverter has good connection to the battery with heavy gauge wiring, don't use the cigarette lighter adapter if it came with one, go straight to the battery with at least 10awg wire and ground it to the chassis as close as possible to the inverter.

M79W3Ct9aa	I'd go with the Chevy.  Forget about the horsepower cuz both will have more than enough horsepower to keep your momentum going.  You want to focus on the TORQUE.  That's the power that you feel and is also what gets you going from the start.  Chevy has been king in this regard when it comes to their stock motors.  The Interceptor clearly will already be built for high speed out of the box since it has more aggresive shift points from the factory, proper gear ratio, and the engine has got power, but it can't reach Chevy's numbers even with the upgrades.  You say that 350 puts out 350 hp so it probably produces 380 lb-ft of torque or something in that range.  The Ford Interceptor uses a 4.6L V8 (assuming its the stock motor) which puts out around 287 lb-ft of torque or so (its probably been really used, remember, and not necessarily in tip-top shape) so its not gonna reach the Chevy level even with a chip and intake.  Just make sure you got some sticky tires on the rear axle.|`|ZndQTqr5aa	I would guess the Vic, only because it's an intercepter and I had a Vic with a 302 that was petty quick.

The older the vehicle and the more miles it has been driven, the more expensive the warranty will be.  In some basic warranties, there are many exclusions on things like upholstery, bright metal trim and most plastics.  In CALIF, for example, there are separate warranties, for the battery, the glass, the electrics, bright metal, etc.  A Typical warranty might say: "Warranted for 4 years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first."

STeK38kgaa	First I hope you mean parking on hills and not driving because you should never engage the emergency brake while moving. Parking wise I wouldn't be too worried about using the e-brake as long as you leave the vehicle in gear it shouldn't move anywhere.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	There is a trick to using the pedal type park brake and clutch to accel on a dead stop incline without rolling back. Any driving school will teach you.But for even more fun join your local Jeep club and they will teach you while out on a wheelin trip<br>  Good Luck have fun and Keep on Jeepin|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Its a pedal to the left of the clutch and the release is right above it.|`|C1JghW33aa	be sure too check with a jeep dealership after you buy it.  there was a recall on alot of the yj's  with the e brake.  it has a habit of disengaging on its own. i still have yet to take my 94 in and have it fixed. its free but the time it takes  , i just dont want to deal with it....
ND1nFEWSaa	your question is too vague. was the wrong key forced into the ignition?is it stuck inside?<br>  <br>  spray lubricating spay in the area, try to remove wrong key with needle plyers,
WhBc23VBaa	in mn the speed ticket is 80$|`|DzlZ42plaa	it says so on the back of the ticket - you were going 19 over so you have to multiply that by the ticket rate (i think its $5 a mile) and then add the court costs as well.  Read your ticket for the most detailed information.<br>  <br>  And just be happy the cop didn't give it to you for 55 miles.  Then it would have been Reckless driving and cost a whole heck of a lot more and add more points to you license
QzAdWvW0aa	Just keep the oil and filters changed and you should be fine. Just keep in mind that there are service items like alternators, water pumps, shocks or struts, tires and a multitude of other little items that do wear out long before you put 200K on them. Some parts start failing at 80 K . I would also call a dealer and check to see if the car was ever recalled for any problems and if your car has the up grades in it. Today everything is in a computer at the dealerships. good luck and happy driving|`|2k8TEiRtaa	The main thing is that you replace the timing belt at least every 35000 miles. And do regular oil and filter changes. At the most every 5000 miles. Checking the coolant and regular maintenance. Including changing the serpentine belt every once in a whilke or checking it for cracks or "threads" which means that the belt is losing threads at the edges. It should last you a good long time.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	20,000 a year is a little high but not bad.  Don't worry about resale value now because it is not considered a low mileage car.  Regular maintenance is always good.  You may want to replace the timing belt at 100,000 to 120,000 miles.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	No, cars are designed to be driven. It's actually more damaging to drive a car 1k-2k miles.15k-20k miles won't damage it. If you maintain the car, you'll just hit 200k miles much faster.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	On the contrary, letting a vehcile sit will do more harm than<br>     driving it. If you do a combination of local and highway miles with<br>     your Camry, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>      95 Camry Owner V6  103,000 miles... ( sitting too long has always<br>      given me more problems than getting it out on the highway ).<br>      And those were minor issues anyway.  Mostly component bearing<br>      squeals till I get it out for a long ride ). That's moisture do it's<br>      dirty deed....<br>  <br>       Good Luck
NPfmdsg8aa	EBCM - electronic brake control module, it's combined in one housing with the brake pressure modulator valve(BPMV). this comined assembly is then called the electrohydraulic control unit(EHCU), all this gibberish simply means that the computer that controls the ABS operation and the solenoids that operate the hydraulic valves are assembled in one package. chances are you where sold that whole unit because with one part of that unit gone the junk yard couldn't sell the remaining unit minus the part. what I'm saying is they wouldn't sell you just the part you needed because the rest of the unit would be worthless to them and for resale.|`|n9AvvZLjaa	that is the abs motor and proportioning valve that controls the fluid going to the wheels
WhBc23VBaa	yes and not hard<br>  if you read the directions|`|uWpwXn6paa	It will be easy to install, but may not start because of the carburetor.Remote starters are for fuel injected engines, if I was to try it I would use one that has an extended crank option.
WhBc23VBaa	cheep 300 real fancy 10k pluss|`|ND1nFEWSaa	being an old model, I would go to maaco auto body, their price to completed job is worth it|`|yh5nYM6baa	just figure around $1300 to $2000 for a really decent paint job.. plus the costs to repair dent damage.. and remember if you dont like the way they did it.. ie: something wrong with the paint job and you complain they should take care of it for free.
bmoCpcdraa	try buffing compound|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Do you mean "primer"?<br>  <br>  Try fine grit wet/dry sand paper and water.<br>  Rub gently, the polish. Then wax....|`|QzAdWvW0aa	Go to your nearest body shop and ask if they will take it off for you. They will be able to tell by looking at what type paint it is and know the best way to remove it. More than likely they will remove it for free while your there. I use to do little free jobs like that while I was in the business. That way I got to meet a new potential customer and possible a friend that wold remember I helped him out when he needs a 10k dollar collision job repaired. Bear in mind some paints are really easy to mess up. You start buffing on it with the wrong compound and you could possibly knock the metallic or pearls right out of it. The same thing with removers. Some are really aggressive and can do a lot of damage before you can get it wiped off. Leave your paint to a pro|`|0B1elHiUaa	Start with a good wax, one that has a cleaner in it or even a polishing compound. Don't go cheap on the wax if you want that paint off.  If it doesn't work then you may have to have the car sprayed.|`|WCBSGuplaa	Easy-Off oven cleaner is what the professional pin-stripers use to remove pinstriping.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	If you do it very gently then use a liquid sandpaper.
AA11914369	Yes, you will have to take the test.  From the SC web page:    Applicants with a Valid License from Another State    If you have a valid driver's license from another state and your documents have been verified, you may be issued a South Carolina drivers license by passing the vision test and surrendering your out-of-state license. If your out-of-state license has expired by 9 months or more, you must successfully complete the knowledge, skills and vision tests.      It's only good for 9 months past the expiration date.  Sorry.
lmSoNMhPaa	you have a bulb burnt out on one side.|`|lMIrbwifaa	HI  If its only one side not working then you probably have a bulb burnt out.. If nether side work it might be the flasher relay unit (its down by the fuses and just plugs in and out). Turn on your 4 way flasher and see what is not flashing from one side to the other. that well usually tell ya which bulb is burnt out.  good luck  tim|`|bfa542a41113a06bd1000a3f8b1b90b7aa	that stinks
eg71zQ5Raa	If you are driving your own car and it is insured for driving abroad then no problem.|`|mKVFIklaaa	No, but you have to be 18 to drive in France: Handy page here;    http://www.drivingabroad.co.uk/driving-i...|`|DolkCwxIaa	You may be getting confused with rental rules. A lot of car rental companies won't let you hire a car unless you've had your driving licence for 3 years. However if you're taking your own car over to France on the ferry, then you should be fine, as long as you meet the legal requirements for French driving.
QdzecSwdaa	The resistor is probably in the dash, where you adjust the speed of the blower, the knob you turn is connected to it

WPYjdsA4aa	floor board wet would indicate your heater core is bad again  does it blow white smoke when running ?   if it does then it is head gasket
ZasNwdXaaa	What Gabriel said.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Better than an auto repair shop, look for an auto upholstery shop.  They'll be able to cut out the bad panel of leather and replace just that piece with a similar color.  This shouldn't be too expensive, a whole new interior is about a grand.  One panel should only be about a hundred or maybe $200 tops.    You won't be happy with any "do it yourself" repair.|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	I would recommend going to a reputable auto body shop for assistance.  The auto body shop will have access to special techs that may be able to help you with the upholstery issue.
rV1uAtt3aa	Go to the library and get hold of the car issues of Consumer Reports.  Another good resource is Cars.com.    I recommend anything by Toyota or Honda.  Avoid American cars as they have a bad track record, and it gets worse the further back you go.    Good luck.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	Toyota Yaris.    Small hatchback.  Fuel efficient.  Inexpensive.  Good resale.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Chevrolet Malibu Maxx,  good mpg, roomy, sharp, power.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You can't go wrong with a used Honda or Toyota, they are quality cars and hold a good resale value!|`|18a5d7e369330da3a47ede67c6e1e096aa	My parents have both had Subarus in the past 5 years and they are both very happy with them. All wheel drive, handle well in the mid-west snow we've been getting. They are VERY sound vehicles and very safe. I thoroughly enjoy driving it. Also, its rather economical for a non-compact car. I would give it a shot.     Best of luck with your search and your ministry!|`|328e52056e90a15c3247940d35d04602aa	Acura Integra coupe is a very nice hatchback. Very reliable and gets 30mpg.|`|SOTdDxfvaa	pray my brother!
TdrgZwnoaa	Too complicated and costly. An engineering nightmare and too many maching processes plus the added casting complexity. Nothing is for FREE.   All that plus the fact that you are adding excess backpressure to the engine and totally fouling up any effective way to clean up the exhaust byproducts.|`|DAilkzubaa	A turbo is free energy, or rather energy that is present and utilized rather than wasted in a supercharged or naturally aspirated engine.|`|3snDlDweaa	But that first answer is totally wrong about everything. I need to study it in more detail and will get back to you. The extra valves seem to be the key.
lmSoNMhPaa	wheel loader some type of tractor? you would be better off to rebuilt it.|`|2yrEjfmLaa	first you need to identify what it is. The bell housing mounts are all different. You can't just hook up any engine. It could be a wisconsin engine as they were commonly used. State the year and make and model if you can't tell what the engine is and someone might be able to tell you.
3UQrUNMSaa	What qualities are you looking for?    Corolla has better fuel consumption, easier to source spare parts.. etc..    And toyota has better resale value compared to hyundai.|`|Tcp3vHMzaa	Corolla, better gas mileage, more reliable, cuter.|`|LuqZXXyBaa	TOYOTA!!! Never pick a Hyundai over a Toyota!|`|LzeMMeWraa	Toyotas are by far better than Hyundais.  Hyundais are made by Korea vs. Toyota made by Japan. (If you care.)  Also, you will get better gas mileage.  I own a Toyota and love it.  My whole family owns Toyotas, and we only have to do regular maintenance-nothing ever breaks.|`|AA10724010	I'd take the Hyundai Elantra over both and it's the true competitor to the Corolla and rated higher by Consumer Reports.  Comparing your 2 choices, it depends on your needs.  The Tucson sits higher and drives more like a truck with greater cargo room and better warranty.  The Corolla is likely cheaper, gets way better gas mileage since its a car and since it's a Toyota will likely depreciate slower.  You can compare at http://www.hyundaiusa.com
w5oQJpDwaa	There are cheap ones out there but I don't recommend them. The Rox are the best IMO and run from $85 to $160.
u3HrKSGqaa	Just the two drive tires.  The other two are just "along for the ride" and not attached to the powertrain in any way.<br>  <br>  Here's a video explaining how it splits torque between those two wheels (With the good old American "CLEAR AND LOUD" teaching method)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4JhruinbWc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4Jhruinb...</a>|`|ivH8tRtsaa	A two wheel drive is exactly what it says. The engine provides power to only two wheels. The next question is," Is it front-wheel-drive or is it rear-wheel-drive?" One easy way to find out is- If your engine sits sideways under your hood, it is front-wheel-drive. If your engine sits in line with your car(front to back), then it is a rear-wheel-drive. Hope this helps.|`|z7KhGeT7aa	actually on most setups it only provides torque to one wheel unless that wheel starts to slip then the differential transfers power to the other wheel. watch someone do a burnout ever notice how one wheel starts spinning then the other|`|XlkdUXkcaa	in 2 wheel drive cars, the engine will pull the car (the front)  <br>  <br>  in 4 wheel drive, all 4 wheels will pull and push the car.  suitable for all terrain|`|KZCQWkfQaa	most will only spin the wheel with the least traction unless it equipped with a limited slip or locking differential in which it will spin both. you cannot have a fully locked differential on the road as it will drag your tires when you turn.|`|k55p1pKraa	Two wheel drive means that only two of the tires or pulling the car, 4 wheel drive means that you can make all 4 wheels pull the vehicle|`|2k8TEiRtaa	The car is using only two wheels to move the car. If you mean like having a 4 wheel drive and then taking off the 4 wheel drive switch or hubs, then the car will run on only 2 wheels. the front or back depends on the car .
fl60KL8oaa	Dude is right.  And don't fret the rain, there are suits that will keep you dry.  If you don't ride in the rain you don't ride.  You might want to get lockable hard saddlebags.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	Well the bike maybe cool but your new college GF's will think its cool too for about the first 2 week's it gets old quick having to hug your back on that noisy rice rocket with a helmet on and she just did her hair and with that FL humidity her hair will stick in that helmet. Besides which would you rather do? Hug your babe in the car or hug your gas tank? Get a car for school and get the bike later to ride with your buddies and maybe when you get older you'll get a Metric chopper and then get the real babes instead of bubble gum Paris|`|5JI64hBnaa	Are you level headed? Get a bike. Sounds like you want it. I think the ninja is fugly though. Don't worry about sun and rain. Get a walmart cover online for $40. Annoying to constantly deal with, but worth it.<br>  <br>  There is nothing like riding a bike in my opinion. But there is a risk. You seem to understand that. Buy a jacket, gloves, and the best helmet you can. Take that MSF course ASAP. <br>  <br>  Do get full coverage insurance in case it gets stolen. And get a disc lock to deter theft. Might even consider an alarml, with a piezo siren or two.|`|fKVF8fufaa	Fortunately you would be in a place where you could ride all year. Unfortunately, you will have no garage, which means your precious bike will have to sleep out in the rain and hot sun, which will really take its toll on your bikes finish, not to mention the chance that it might get stolen.  Just get a cheap piece of crap car for now, it will be one less thing to worry about.|`|rpeArrXdaa	Bikes are really cool ,but If you have no where to keep it it will get trashed by the Sun or ripped off by the dead beats. So get your self a car, until you have finished Uni then go for a bike .<br>  <br>  Triumph Speed triple , or a naked CBR1000, or a GSXR 1000(Gixer) with a Yoshi pipe learn to do stoppies and wheelies then pull the chicks, & race away from the Cop's give your parents some thing to worry about
Q2wdm3spaa	You don't mention whether you've taken any training courses or not. If you haven't, try that. Your local dealer or ABATE chapter should be able to help you get into one. Beyond that, like Jayman said, find a place to practice. Plastic cups can make good cones, and you can carry a dozen or so pretty easy.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Observation is one of the keys to good riding, when cornering you will tend to go where you are looking so you have to assess a corner as you approach it, can you see the exit, if so, as you approach you need to concentrate on the apex (not to the exclusion of everything else) and once that is achieved, look at the exit. At a right hand corner move to the left of your side of the road, that gives you far more time to see the exit, you do not need to clip the apex but get near to it, a left hand corner is the opposite. (NB these road positions apply when you are riding through corners not at junctions – as this will confuse muppets in cars). <br>  <br>  As a beginner you do not want to be applying brakes in the corner get that over before you start to turn in, select the correct gear and ride around the corner with a trailing throttle (that is with some throttle applied – do not corner with the clutch in or with no throttle). Do not increase or decrease the throttle until you are past the apex as that will cause you to go wide (increasing throttle) or too tight (decreasing).<br>  <br>  When cornering look at the exit but also watch the point at which the left and right kerbs meet, if that point seems to be coming towards you the corner is tightening up, if the point seems to be moving away from you the corner will not be as severe as you first thought.<br>  <br>  When riding you should always be aware of what is in front of you and behind you – frequently beginners find themselves fixating on the few feet in front of the front wheel, move your point of vision all the time, look as far ahead as you can, check out side turnings, anticipate them by looking for clues, breaks in hedges, trees or buildings could indicate a side road. Apart from frequently checking the mirror before you perform any manouevre check over your shoulder (the lifesaver), for turning left check over your left shoulder (and vice versa for right). Any manouevre includes pulling away from a junction, changing lanes, making a turn off. Do not ignore your peripheral vision this can pick up moving objects very well.|`|aAOgJvjSaa	Just practice, practice, practice. Set up some cones in an abandoned parking lot and practice with out any traffic around you.<br>  <br>  P.S. You should be taking a quick glance in your mirrors every few seconds so you know what the rest of the traffic is doing.|`|246c4887a1d51a98dcfd5795d476a2fcaa	Go to The Motorcycle Safety Foundation's site, <motorcyclesafetyfoundation.com>  and see about attending one of their schools. it's around three hundred bucks, But the skills they'll teach you could well be the best life insurance you'll ever buy.

I used to have several just about like you describe except either 402 or 427 c.i.  They all ran low 12s on 7 inch slicks and were practically unbeatable street cars in the early 70s.  You will probably find the engine to be a 2 bolt and can tell by looking at the block above the oil filter pad.  If a 4 bolt it will have two large fitting holes about 1/2" pipe thread for installation of an oil cooler.  A two bolt will have much smaller fittings, 1 or 2, about 1/8" pipe thread.  You can cut these oval port heads 60 thousandths easily to raise the compression but I would seriously try to afford some aluminum ones.  Also, you valve lift is great for the street but if you go much higher watch out for the valve spring retainer coming down and hitting the top of the valve guide/seal.  If that  happens you won't get 30 miles out of the cam.|`|TKgVwBF2aa	Thats a pretty big job. Aint to many people gonna answer that. But you are the man. not to many people would do that. Except me. I am  taking on an project myself. I'm planning on putting an supercharged 283 in my 1966 Bel-Air. u know to release all my horses. I would not order a crate engine though. I wont to do it by hand and get it right the first time. + i wona get my hands dirty.|`|AA12143825	As far as being able to tell the difference or to see if its a big block or small block motor without taking off the oil pan, Just look at the headers. If its a small block the exhaust ports are close together in the middle of the head so the header will have pipes that sit close together in the middle coming off the head. if its a big block it wont. The pipes will be more evenly spaced coming off the head. <br>  <br>  the 454 in 1981 wasnt much for power because it was during the dark times right after the oil crisis. As a matter of fact some of the slowest and least powerful motors were manufactured in that time period. <br>  <br>  I think the Corvette that year had like 170hp or there abouts. <br>  A far cry from the 400+hp from the late 60's or even the current Motors that make 400+hp and get 30mpg on the highway not to mention have more power all the way through the rpm range.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt waste your money on that. For what it would cost you to build it up your better off buying a crate motor from Summit or RHS etc

oE0ApHqPaa	When I got rid of my Wrangler, it had almost 200,000 miles on it and it still ran great.  It just depends on how the previous owner(s) have taken care of it.  I think 8k is a pretty awesome budget to start with (unless you are looking for something shiny & new-ish, mine was a 1992), I only had 2,500 and still managed to find a good one (for less!), it just took a while.<br>  <br>  Listen to the advice about the 4 cylinder, I didn't and it's the only thing I regretted about my Jeep, you have barely any power at all.  And don't bother with auto transmission, it just doesn't feel right.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	It just depends on how well the previous owner has maintained and treated the jeep. Be it wrangler, cherokee, or grand, with out any major engine work from you average John Q. Public 185-210K a well maintained jeep 300-350K. Check on craigslist for your wrangler and make sure you do not get the 4 cylinder, less cost yes but less HP and in the long run you will regret it, And for 8g's you could buy 2 Grand Cherokees, buy a 3.5 inch lift kit, rims tires and neat stuff for both of then and go out for pizza and beer with change for a couple tanks of gas<br>  Hope this helps Good Luck and keep on Jeepin

You do not have the skills to under stand a sport bike goes from idle to 12,000 to 14,000 rpms an upwards of 180 horsepower in a quarter turn of the throttle.  Too violent for a beginner.

I've never dropped the bike and it had ample power for me. I just took it slow and went for many a ride on empty country roads, I put on a lot of miles before I even rode on city streets. Get a good feel for the bike and just take it slow before you start to go faster. Also be weary of the clutch! Let that sucker out slow and easy, I nearly flipped my bike over backwards by letting it out too fast!|`|Q8GFvklUaa	learning to ride on a 600cc super sport bike is like learning to fly in an F-16. <br>  <br>  The problem comes in parking lots for one, until you learn how to control the violent throttle and heavy bike you fall over and get bucked.<br>  <br>  Shifting gears, you think your in 4th and actually in 3rd or 2nd (due to lack of experience) and you hit the throttle and flip over.<br>  <br>  Going around corners, lack of experience will make you want to go slow then you have some one on your tail or you accidentally blip the throttle and you go off road and wake up a few hours later.<br>  <br>  All these things I listed are from people I know that got a 600cc super-sport to learn on.<br>  <br>  If your seriously asking this question, have never ridden a bike, then get the Kawasaki Ninja 250r, if your just insecure and think it's too weak (it's not I have one and love it) then get the Kawasaki Ninja 650r.<br>  Both bikes have height handle bars and less violent acceleration. <br>  <br>  If you get a cbr600 to learn on give me your number, so when you lay it down or get hurt and become scared to ride it, I can buy it from you because your desperate to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  All the guys telling you to get one are either messing with you or they had extensive motocross experience. If not they are the 1 in 100 that actually had pulled it off.<br>  <br>  The other 99 out of a 100 became a S.Q.U.I.D. Look it up.|`|AA12161154	I started on a 1999 Honda CBR600F4 and I loved it (and survived). In response to everyone that says "It's too big", yes, they're right but that doesn't mean you can't handle it. I would definitely recommend taking a MSF course. I took one and that took to the streets of Boston with my cbr600 and was fine. It was scary at times but as long as you're not stupid then you'll be fine. There is plenty of power there to hurt or even kill yourself but you just have to be mindful of that. You can hurt yourself on a 250cc bike too. Maybe not as easily but the chance is still there. If you're going to be smart about it, meaning . . take the course, buy all of the gear (helmet, gloves, pants, boots, jacket), and take it easy then go for the 600. You'll enjoy it.|`|5JI64hBnaa	Anyone who will "quickly outgrow" a cbr600 is a maniac or doesn't know what they're talking about. <br>  <br>  Let grandad tell you a little story. I met a fellow with a new cbr600 and was jealous at first. Asked him if he wanted to go riding. An hour later he dumped it trying to make a u-turn on a street with a little bit of mud on it. Gave it too much power, the rear tire broke lose and that was that. There was very little damage besides his ego and we continued riding. Maybe an hour later on a twisty road only doing about 40-45mph this guy flew right off the road (I mean he FLEW) because it had about a 6 foot drop. He luckily survived with little injury. Even the bike miraculously had little damage besides scratching. Took 3 of us all our strength to get that little 400 pound bike up that little 6 foot hill due to the loose soil. They his motor smoked for the next ten miles (I'm guessing cuz the bike was upside down and oil made it into the top of the engine).<br>  <br>  Okay that was long winded, but my point is that a 100 horsepower bike that weighs 400 pounds is not the best beginner bike. You are probably going to drop the bike at minimum, dump it, or even crash it in your first few months. Get a beater to learn on then upgrade when you have some experience. <br>  <br>  PS not all 600s are created equal. I recommend a yamaha seca II to begin on. Maybe even a suzuki bandit or sv650. They have less HP, and the sv has tons of torque which is fun. Suzuki gs500e perhaps. A bike with a more upright seating position will help you learn better.<br>  <br>  Most important though is your BRAIN. Do not let your ego tell you you are special **** or that you can keep up with experienced riders. This will almost certainly result in an accident. I promise.<br>  <br>  I have been riding for 9 years. 9 different bikes from 50cc (laugh if you want) to 900cc. I love my yzf600r. It's fast enough but not crazy fast. I've never crashed knock on wood.<br>  <br>  Trust what I'm saying here.<br>  <br>  1. dont ride at night<br>  2. dont ride during rush hour<br>  3. dont ride while late or in a hurry<br>  4. always give yourself an out because people dont look for or respect bikes<br>  5. buy the best helmet you can, gloves, jacket, etc.<br>  6. don't EVER tell yourself you can beat an oncoming car (while you want to make a left turn)<br>  <br>  I'm partial to yamaha's after nothing but good experiences. 3 yamahas and 20,000 miles and no repairs ever needed. Honda is good, of course, but not better than Yamaha. Suzukis that I've had just didn't feel as quality, but they were a bit older.|`|5c38535818f81c4f57fb43674b96a789aa	It was my beginner bike. so yes!|`|L2LlCuLkaa	Personally, I would go a 250 upto a 400, depending on the bike.<br>  <br>  600 is way too much power for a beginner, I'm also learning and have a ZZR250, nice faired bike, and just enough power for me as a beginner.<br>  <br>  The last thing you want to do is have too much power between you legs, loose bike from under you, it happens...... and either kill yourself or injure your self, - if not, Scratch the crap out of your bike. not good with a nice bike like a CBR.|`|rpeArrXdaa	Any Honda product is a quality product.<br>  The CBR600 is a great little sports bike , however the CBR600 RR is the best 600 on the market very quick , lite and responsive . If your short then yes go for the CBR, If your over 6ft tall you may look a bit big on the bike . But for your first bike , great bike ,but please treat it with respect and it will look after you.|`|YoC5ksLkaa	600 superbikes a not the best bike to start on best thing to do i to go to a motorcycle school and take the course but i started with a 650 dual purpose and probably the best bikes to start with very easy clutches and very forgiving and sportbike is not forgiving and you can go too fast for your own good <br>  please make a safe decision and get some thing you can handle this is from your fellow rider|`|thGfyqHraa	A 600 is a perfect size for a beginner.  If you are sure you're going to stick with it, I'd consider something larger.  You will quickly out-grow the 600.|`|tLf8ZNaDaa	Too big, too fast. My brohter sold 26 Honda cbr600's a few years ago. Every one that was sold as a beginner's bike came back to the shop smashed up.
gkrNPM5Daa	It would need to pump the throttle once or twice to set the choke and squirt a little fuel in to fire it up cold. I looked around for a kit to do this and found nothing. I never tried it but I figured if you find a solenoid with the strength and travel to pump the throttle you could pump it. I don't see how the remote start would know how to pump it so I'd hook the solenoid to an auxiliary button on the remote. Hit the aux to give a pump then hit the start button.<br>   If you don't want the alarm function you can get a remote start without it.|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	AWW THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!!!<br>  <br>  SO I THINK ITS JUST THE WIRING BUT U ALSO HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING FOR IT....WHICH IM NOT SURE ABOUT YET.<br>  <br>  AND THE REMOTE START IS ONLY TO WARM IT UP.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	When you say older car. How old. If it is not fuel injected no.  Not a definite no as there may possibly be kits available for carburetor engines but I doubt it very much as it is a pretty elaborate system in comparison to fuel injected.|`|1Xq0W8XWaa	I had remote start on my 90 camaro and eventually when i would hit the remote start button it would scratch my engine like as if you were to turn the key in the ignition and keep it held to the right. it worked fine for months and then started to do that..
0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Bad "knock sensor" not adjusting the engine timing properly.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	that tinking that you mentioned is detonation, the singe most destructive noise in an engine. it is cause by ignition timing that is off, or a lean fuel mixture or even  carbon build up on the pistons i=or in the head. since you mentioned a fuel leak, i think that the mixture is the problem ( a knock sensor should still be able to adjust for this to an extent). i would look the car over with the engine off and the key in the on position so that the furl lines do indeed have some pressure, now look for a wet spot. when you find that wet spot replaced the failed part and go for a test drive.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	have your car checked at any autozone or such store for a trouble code. This will give you a general idea of what it might be, It could be a faulty EGR valve, a bad  sensor, bad Idle Air Control Valve, or even a bad fuel regulator. But having a trouble code will narrow it down considerably. If you from the US the code will start with a P001 on.|`|QzAdWvW0aa	You could have cracked vacuum lines, cracked fuel line, Bad sensor, Dirty or faulty mas air flow sensor. First with your engine off and cool look over every hose and line in and around the engine. Check that there are no broken wires or wires hanging off the senders. Check your air filter make sure it is flowing good and not plugged up. Also if you live in farm country or near wooded areas check all the wires around your engine for any that may be chewed on by mice. Some times mice or a rat will crawl under your hood and really do some damage
qTiPGoHaaa	High beam filament is blown|`|2FT7sVkbaa	ummm  aaahhh  burnt out headlight bulb?<br>  <br>  the headlight bulb has 2 filaments , one for the low beam and one for the high beam, the high beam filament is burnt out
ojxfzv7Faa	Upright, it usually isn't a good idea to set a fridge on its side or back. Some refrigerators have compressors that aren't design to be transported that way.<br>  <br>  Use some strong ratchet tie downs to hold it to the rails or sides of the trailer. If you can, try to box and hold in the fridge with whatever you can use to help keep it from shifting.<br>  <br>  And make sure it's at the front of the trailer, you'll need tongue weight in the front of the trailer to transport it safely.|`|AA10091300	upright you don't want to tip it on it's side at all. tie or bungee strap it in well. don't speed|`|yeu17dNOaa	if there are hookes on the inside then use a bungee cord, rope, ect. See if the person that you are buying it from can deliver if it is not to far away. You should alwars lay it down so the handles are up so you can put the ropes throught the handle. Also the handle could brake off or the fridge roll around if the front is domed.|`|MTkXXOsjaa	A lower center of gravity is always better/safer so put it on its side and strap it down both longways and shortways.|`|dz084ZoNaa	The ghetto way is to just stick it there and have some guy hold it......wouldn't recomend that though, unless you're ghetto.
