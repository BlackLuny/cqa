Isn't lying wrong?  Should they tell Nazi sodiers, "we have them upstairs", because that is the truth?    So, depending on the situation, the end can justify the means.    BUT not always.

Especially when they say that they know Him closer and more real than they do their own flesh and blood family members.    This is a flat-out impossibility.    They lie about archaeological finds:  http://www.tentmaker.org/WAR/    Bishop Eusebius, who was an Early Church Historian, was one of a few who had decisive control over the formation of Christianity.    Everything in his employment was dedicated to making Christianity appear legitimate, and in that sense, he is the first semi-honest Christian apologist.    He writes,    "We shall introduce into history, in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity."                       Ecclesiastical History, (Vol. 8, chapter 2)    and also    a chapter in his Praeparatio Evangelica is titled, "How it may be Lawful and Fitting to use Falsehood as a Medicine, and for the Benefit of those who Want to be Deceived" (book 12, chapter 32).    In fact, the first mention of Jesus (Chrestus) allegedly by Josephus (an earlier Jewish Historian  Antiquities of the Jews), came directly from Eusebius  there is NO mention of Jesus, Chrestus, or any reference of anything remotely related to the Gospel story in any original Josephus manuscript!    The same is true for Pliny and Tacitus.  IT is a fact that references to Jesus were forged by the Church.    Q: Since it is evident that the early formation of Christianity, as well as all literature (all literature was confiscated by the Church [no matter the fact of wide-spread illiteracy, the fact remains that the Church had total control of knowledge]  is fraught with deception, why is it that people of faith cannot understand that their feelings of knowledge about their relationship with God/Jesus is not also suspect  especially in the context of so many other religions confessing a similar, unshakable relationship with their God?     Doesnt it follow, that since all of them cannot be right, each one is an indictment of the other?    Here is my site and on it you can find debates between me and J.P. Holding from Tektonics (He quit responding two months ago, since I won the debate) and also you can find the entire quote from Eusebius  and for those interested, I have debates on here with Josh MacDowell and Lee Strobel:    http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/r...|`|B5Fm455paa	The ends justify the means when the ends justify the means.

He was an observant social theorist who simply pointed out that when it comes to politics, such a policy happens to be effective for helping keep a ruler in power. The fact is, if a leader is good at getting things done and giving his people what they think they want, they tend to be willing to overlook his methods.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	are you talking about any specific ends?|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	First we must separate Reality and illusion.  The physical plane is the illusion and there is no Reality on the physical plane save the Souls hidden within the many people, animals and plants inhabiting this plane.    So, the key to what something "costs" is the Karma involved in the action taken.  And what do you mean by "ends"?  Do you mean goal, as in some goal in the illusion, or do you mean Goal as in the Purpose of Life?    For every action taken there is coming to oneself the same action being taken against oneself. This is the Reality of Karma working in the illusion.  The Law of Karma:  As you sow, so shall you reap.  And this is an Absolute Law that no one escapes, avoids or gets around.    In the illusion a person can rob, steal, kill, and obtain a goal in any way one desires.... and then one will pay for such action at the time of ones death in some hell, and one will pay again as each action one has taken comes back to one in ones future lives.  Karma is Absolute.    Peace|`|eO2rnf7yaa	It is never OK to willingly do evil so that good will come from it.  Sometimes it is confusing as to what is evil.  The most common challenge I have heard on this is something like "What if you had to lie to hide someone from a murderer?"  We are not supposed to lie, so what is right?     It is not a moral obligation to provide the  truth to someone who has no moral right to demand the truth.   A murderer has no moral right to demand cooperation from others in the murderer's attempts to carry out the murderer's evil actions.  To lie to the murderer in such a case is not morally wrong.     Most times that people choose to do evil in order to achieve some alleged good, the person is just taking what they think is the easy way out.  Doing the right thing is often difficult.  We have no moral right to demand an easy life.  Doing things the right way, without committing evil acts is our moral obligation at all times.    It must also be remembered that mere humans are not omnipotent.  Some situations can arise in which we do not have the power to achieve a good thing that we see is called for.  In situations that genuinely do not allow us to achieve a good outcome and to totally avoid anything evil,  we must hope and trust in God's ultimate eternal mercy for victims of evil.  But under no conditions is it morally permissible to engage in an evil action in order that some desired good outcome will come about    To the best of your ability, choose Good and always reject Evil.    Peace be with you.|`|dl97DmmYaa	Do the ends ever justify the means?   No.    So what do you think, is committing a few sins acceptable to carry out the greater good?   No    Are their certain situations in which it would this would be acceptable and others in which it wouldnt?   Maybe.    Are we more harshly judged by our peers (and God for that matter) on the ways in which we accomplish something than by the actual result?  Sometimes.    Also, if you belong to a certain faith or school of philosophy which has shaped your ideology on this matter, could you list it.   Karl Marx, Albert Einstein, Schopenhauer.    So if you are greatly influenced by the works of Machiavelli and that makes you believe the way you do, I would be interested to hear it.  No.

RrQNJsVsaa	Yes actually, they actually are souls so they can still die but just for a while. They can't die forever. Well that is for Angels.      Demons can rarely die. They have a power that allows them to control their own death. They don't die unless they want to. It is their choice. If they do die though, it is just like Angels, they will come back. But quicker. Sooner than the angels do. Demons are said to be stronger than angels. They kind of basically are. Demons come to life quicker than angels because angels like to die. When you die as an angel you will be in another body for a while, while the body-soul owner is switched to go to heaven until the angel leaves the body and than doesn't know a thing and just acts casual.  Demons they just see pitch black.|`|OoJNjnW6aa	No, but demons you can push back through the portals back to hell, any angels; why would you want them to die?|`|a86de0fc85e991d8d111b09367571df7aa	Only if you kill 'em dead.    :P|`|E2oH02h8aa	This question is one that has no true answer, but endless theories. In my opinion (well in a nutshell) I believe their is the possibility that if they truly exist,  one that has died can die again. Of course, I have no scientific explanation, mainly because one does not exist. Another personal believe is that Angels nor Demons exist (one that does not exist cannot die, for it never exist).There is only people and things of that nature. When you die you will enter a mental abyss, there will be no Angels nor demons, heaven nor hell, happiness nor sadness, just nothing. Luckily though (if you want to call it that) you are not in the proper state of mind, so you will never make the connection that you are in eternal darkness.|`|QGRZUMj8aa	I'm not sure about angels but yes demons can die. But an average demon's life span is a lot longer than that of a humans. A demon can live over 1000 years.|`|7nbqb4e2aa	No... They wouldn't be in "body" form, with hearts/brains/etc that can stop working.    Plus, I hate how the media (usually video games) portrays even the Christian context of Angels/Demons as often "at war" as if they could fight or die or something... The Christian context of Angels/Demons is that Angels are of extreme power (100% untouchable), and Demons are former Angels that are basically reduced to mush, removable by a mere thought... Their power can only manifest (come into play) in the life of a PERSON (only) that openly says "yes" to their ways.|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	I don't think so.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	Angels are spirits without bodies, who possess superior intelligence, gigantic strength and can not die    Demons are spirits that act malevolently against human beings.and can not die      D?mon~~?

Ever heard of Pascals Wager? I think that is a pretty clear indication that some people "beleive" just to cover their own butts.|`|Lgmg6uYKaa	Well in a way, yes. Jesus and the practice of being indicative of him in every way possible is the only way to an everlasting life in heaven.    But that's not the only reason why Christians practice Christianity.    Ever heard of a mass charity/organization fueled by an aetheist group?    Didn't think so.    The point is, the "insurance" as you put it is the major point of Christianity, but God deeply stresses other things to go with that as well.     Did you know that the majority of the working class are Christians or those who believe in God? Or did you know that most of the charities in America were founded by a Christian person?    The point is, if you are a Christian, the "insurance" is the personal aspect of it but if you are a true Christian, the other stuff will come naturally because God stresses it in the Bible.    Don't ask the Christians to prove to you there is a God. In the end, it's your call. I hope you find it someday. Truly.|`|C9nOqOZKaa	Can you elaborate more please?  Insurance?  Is it wrong?

I have never in my life had anyone yell at me and I keep myself under control and speak softly with a big stick . . . Just kidding about the stick.    It's all about self control and treating others as you would like to be treated.  DeeJay.    EDIT: Why are you angry - kick that anger in the butt.  It's possible.|`|mCS5Dy7paa	i get lost in my music, and i listen to different music depending on my mood, and it helps me get out any bad thoughts or energy.. other then that, i vent with my friends and talk about what is bothering us.

I just kind of ask myself if this thing that happened is worth me get angry over and after I think about for a few minutes I always decide that it is just way to much effort to get angry. Just to exhausting. So, I let most things go. But, I make that choice.

I find that helps me see things more clearly and I can really trash the person who angered me without actually saying something to them that I would probably regret later.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I get a notebook with lots of blank pages in it.  Sit down and write about it.  Write anything that I am thinking.  Write, and write and write.  Finally, I have writer's cramp, and the anger is all disbursed onto the pages and not inside me any more.    In the summer, I build a fire in my fire pit in my back yard.  Wad up all the pages and burn them all away.  In the winter, I run the pages thru the shredder.    There.  Anger is all gone.  No one got hurt.

bTA5ndeMaa	The answer is self contained in the scriptures.  The symbol of the beast is a political unit or a unit composed of many such.      The horns and mountains also refer to governments or kings.    Dan 7:17 says relevant to this: "These great beasts, . . ., are  . . . kings who shall arise out of the earth.    When we see the violent behavior of governments, the uncontrolled killing going on throughout history by such, isn't it the most apt simile to apply to these?    Rapture:  Is a teaching that all Christians shall be removed from earth at some time.  A better explanation may be found on Wikipedia.    It is not correct in all its implications.  All Christians will not go to heaven, only the saints shall.  Thus a modified rapture teaching is necessary for it to be correct.    You are not alone in using Biblical names in your story.  Star wars and superman also use many such names, even using borrowed profiles modified heavily to meet their stories needs.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	In prophecy a beast is always a kingdom of man    In revelation the two beasts are:    1- Western Roman Empire (based in Rome)  2- Eastern Roman Empire (based in Constantinople)    Rapture as it is taught today does not exist.

Are you going to eventually publish it? Before I go on, I am a Christian. I hope I can be of some help.    Okay, in the bible, there's a lot of figurative language. These stories have a greater meaning, there's really not going to be a river of fire or anything (even through it sounds interesting). What that analogy means is that in the end, the devil will be conquered with the Antichrist (a person like Obama, promising loads of poo) and the false profit, his sidekick type guy.    The rapture is the first coming of Jesus back to Earth. Everyone who believed in him will be taken up to heaven, non believers will have another chance to believe like seven years after the rapture takes place.     Remember, a lot of Christian websites will have this information, like Rick Warren. Good luck with your book, email me a piece of your first chapters; I'd love to read it!|`|U51pBeLfaa	I see you have got some good replies already. The rapture is supposed to be when the good people are taken out of this world leaving the bad people behind. Hence the joke: if you are a bad person don't rely on a Christian pilot (he or she could be raptured away leaving you in a plane high in the sky).    The beast is whatever evil you want it to be. If the cap fits put it on the beast.    In my opinion it has all happened. In which case the beast represents the Roman Empire. I take it as a story of encouragement that if we find ourselves in similar situations then we should place our hope in God who will fix all things and make them new.    The writing is obscure because the author was writing in prison and could not write something like 'Down with the Roman Empire'. The people he was writing it to  would understand the code that he was writing it in.    Other Christians have other ideas about what it all means.    I saw Underworld 3 that was awesome.|`|C9nOqOZKaa	REad REvelations, there you will know how the BEast LooKs LikE.

XzEGvaXjaa	XD That's hilarious. His screaming scared the **** out of me the first time.    We learned about something like this in my social psychology class today. Basically, people will often blindly believe authority figures for a number of reasons. Fear, ignorance, pressure, etc. are all reasons for this. For Christians, we often feel pressure from other Christians to believe everything a pastor would say. A pastor is presented as an authority figure; he is the one who knows everything and we are the lowly students who need to learn from him, and so we are pressured to conform to whatever he would say lest suffer "eternal damnation in Hell". This is also a matter of ignorance because we often do not know enough about our own religion to trust our own interpretations, therefore we have others interpret it for us. I have felt this pressure a number of times and while I did not blindly follow, I often followed anyway because of fear and ignorance. Once I learned more about God and began to develop my individual relationship with him, I quit church and will probably never go again. I still believe in the Bible and in Jesus, but I do not believe in church being the proper way to study the Lord. Not in this day and age anyway. In this day and age, churches are all about appearances and money...    That's just my theory based on psychology. Another theory is the fact that there are just batshit crazy Christians out there and they need a batshit crazy pastor to follow! And so they have him, lol.|`|casg30Ataa	whatever helps them get thru life|`|tl2pMkOcaa	...and you blame him for actually being passionate about Biblical principles?

Environment has all too often mastered religion. Page 1132-3    Religion arises as a biologic reaction of mind to spiritual beliefs and the environment; it is the last thing to perish or change in a race. Religion is society's adjustment, in any age, to that which is mysterious. As a social institution it embraces rites, symbols, cults, scriptures, altars, shrines, and temples. Holy water, relics, fetishes, charms, vestments, bells, drums, and priesthoods are common to all religions. And it is impossible entirely to divorce purely evolved religion from either magic or sorcery. Page 1004-1    6. The age of spiritual striving. When evolving mortals have passed through the physical, intellectual, and social stages of development, sooner or later they attain those levels of personal insight which impel them to seek for spiritual satisfactions and cosmic understandings. Religion is completing the ascent from the emotional domains of fear and superstition to the high levels of cosmic wisdom and personal spiritual experience. Education aspires to the attainment of meanings, and culture grasps at cosmic relationships and true values. Such evolving mortals are genuinely cultured, truly educated, and exquisitely God-knowing.

Nu6vDwLtaa	then what is written in the bible is not really gods will but merely an interpretation of it.  and if it is an interpretation the how can it be the word of god?  there are books in the bible that talk about the same subject, yet can disagree with anothers point of view.  each of these books says that it is the word of god.  compare to another book and the word of god has just been contradicted.  is it really the word of god?    the word of god should be just that, one word or sentence that should never change, no matter who is writing it or who is interpreting it.  no, the word of god has come to mean mans desire to have control over something he feels is below him.  such as women, gays, blacks, other religions etc.    was there really a word of god?  did this word of god say to kill all the pagans if they didnt convert, and the word changed and said thou shalt no kill?  this makes no sense to me.  did the word of god say thou sahll not kill, but then the word of god ordered moses to kill 10,000 innocent people in the name of him?|`|eAMq1iBWaa	You too eh?|`|3nw2Pwu8aa	It doesn't always coincide with our will.

Different people beleive different things because we are ALL comming to the knowlegde of the truth we are on this journey together to know Jesus.

So to discover what God's will is, one must find God and ask Him.  There is and has always been a God-Man on this physical plane since the beginning of time.  So if one is actually interested in God's will, one would be wise to search out such a God-Man.    The Soul of the homosexual is equal with all Souls, but not in this illusion.   The Karma that the homosexual is generating in denying God is substantial, and this life is just the beginning of paying for that denial.  And I am not speaking of paying lip service to some religion. But if one desires to "test" God by denying Reality and embracing the delusional thinking of this Iron Age, then one is free to do this.  But as I say, the cost is quite substantial.    Peace|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	It's because we choose to choose God over our selves. We don't tell ourselves he is not real when we have believed and know. Or ask for proof when we have the Bible, because we read it in ignorance instead of using logic, reasoning, FAITH and seeking understanding of what we read. Also you misunderstand the other things you put it would take to long to explain. Just read the Bible and get an understanding. People have different interpretations to benefit theselves but TRUE christians have the holy spirit and live to honor God not them selves. I love God and you but God loves you more than I do. God bless seek knowledge.

European here, and see the rest who have answered had to copy and paste it. I guess they don't study European history in the US|`|bda465ikaa	Empress Matilda was the only surviving child of Henry I, and the granddaughter of William the Conqueror. In present day she would become queen, but in the 11th century there had never been a sovereign queen.   -Matilda was betrothed at the age of 7, and a month before her 12th birthday she was married to the Holy Roman Emperor. This marriage gave her the title of Empress (a title she used for the rest of her life). She was widowed at the age of 23. The marriage produced no children. Her second marriage was to Geoffrey of Anjou at age 26 (he was only 15). Geoffrey assumed the royal name of Plantagenet.  - Matilda's father died just before her 36th birthday. Matilda expected to become Queen of England, but her cousin Stephen of Blois usurped the throne , breaking the oath he had previously made to defend her rights. Stephen's claim to the throne was that he was a man, and there had never been a sovereign queen. The civil war that followed lasted about a decade and was extremely bloody. It is referred to as "The Anarchy".  -------  The resolution of the war came when Matilda gave up her claim to the throne with the understanding that her son, Henry II, would accede upon Stephen's death. Traditionally, Matilda is not considered one of the monarch's of England because she was never crowned. However, her descendants would rule the country to the present day. The agreement was possible because Stephen's son died.  -----  Empress Matilda outlived Stephen by 13 years, but her son was crowned instead of her in accordance with the agreement. She lived the latter part of her life in Normandy and died at the age of 65 (very old for the 11th century).  --------  This agreement could have possibly been used as a model to resolve the competing claims of Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots. If Mary had renounced her claim in exchange for the agreement that her son James would rule, it is possible that it wouldn't have been necessary to execute Mary. Once Mary renounced her claim, people couldn't use her name for assasination plots. Elizabeth was already in her mid 50's and she had to name an heir eventually. She named James only a few year's before her own death.|`|N7CJSTr1aa	Empress Matilda, as she is more commonly known as, was the daughter of King Henry I. She married first Henry V Emperor of Germany, and than Geoffrey of Anjou. She fought against her cousin Stephen for the crown after her father and brother died, but lost. When Stephen died, he had no heir, so Matilda's son, Henry, then took the crown as King Henry II, thereby starting the Plantagenet Era.

God passed down laws for us to follow and He had perfect reasons for each on of them. For example, there were times when the people were not to eat particular foods.......when populations of people who did not follow Gods teachings got sick, and many died as a result of eating food which was bad for them, seeing the Israelites flourish without sickness at all among them would in fact be a wonderful example of How God just knows what is best for us....He has a perfect reason behind everything.

When government didn't exist, taxes couldn't be withheld from such governments because their laws didn't exist yet!  Could they now?!!    Before society got established in the present day manner, many of the laws presently common to most nations were unknown.  Even the issues were unknown.  Try to ask Abraham about illegal insider trading and why that would be wrong?  Truly your logic machinery needs an upgrade.    In the same manner, incest is a law that was found necessary as societies grew.  Under the law covenant this law was instated. Previous to the Israelites becoming a nation, there was no such law.    Since there was no such law there could be no such transgression.  Use you mental abilities so as not to display too much ignorance!    The law empowers acts to become illegal or sinful.  Without law, there can be no transgression.  -------  You're giving Thor a bad rep.  (Star gate Thor)|`|eAMq1iBWaa	It was the only way in the beginning. And the gene pool was pristine then.

It seems you're making excuses for homosexuals. The lifestyle is sinful and it is mentioned as so in the Bible. Some 'gay-friendly' "churches" have removed parts from the Bible which discuss the implications of deviant sexual behavior - adding to or removing from scripture has serious consequences according to God Himself.    (1 Cor 6:9,10) "What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit Gods kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit Gods kingdom    (Romans 1:27) "That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error."    Revelation 22:18-9 states:    "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book."    Finally, Matthew 16:26:    ""For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	Of course we all "sin", or have shortcomings...anger, temper, swearing, etc. because we are imperfect.  But even being imperfect, we should not use that as an excuse for CONTINUING to do wrong things.  We should be making an effort to STOP doing those wrong things.  Even the apostle Paul admitted he had faults, yet he was chosen by Jesus as an apostle.  (1 Corinthians 9:27) but I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.  From God's point of view, He knows we cannot be perfect, so it is the EFFORT we put in that He appreciates.  If we happen to swear because of pressures of life, we should immediately apologise for doing so.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Because gay people look funny, especially on their floats in their tutus.

But apparently you have seen this. To answers your questions in order.    1. Yes I understand it, these people are human and they are going to mistakes even in regards to judging other people.     2. Yes it does and I believe that passing a judgment for the sake of it doing so is wrong and that any criticism should be out of Love only    3. I can't say that.. its not my place to "judge" them    And lastly I think you gotta realize by assuming that these people you see only pass judgment or pay attention to the sin of homosexuality is a form of judgment also and you may not have the full picture.|`|AA11648578	Neither bacon nor shrimp is sinful but to live your life in sin is not good.  The atonement by faith should make you a new creature.  We are in a process of being perfected and we are perfected by faith.  We should not serve sin. You are correct all of us are sinners and there is no difference between sins they all end in death. The answer is through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Thee is no such thing as two married men. Marriage is defined by God as two a man and a woman becoming one flesh as we are body and spirit and are one man..We are not spirit and spirit nor are we flesh and flesh. We are one soul a marriage of body and spirit and this is the order of God who is Father Son and Holy Spirit and is one God.|`|OZAxA6J5aa	Well, I really haven't seen any Christians who went around condemning homosexuals for their sins at Denny's and I Hop. There seems to be a lot of this on the internet, but that's the internet for you.   Yes, I think they are Christians. And I also think they are just trying to help (or perhaps really annoyed). I mean, homosexuality is one of those sins that is very much debated. Most sinful actions are condemned by the majority of society as wrong. (I certainly get irked when a Christian tells me that the Bible doesn't condemn homosexuality.)  Regardless, the great thing about the internet is that you and I can easily avoid and disregard people that go pointing their fingers at all the sin in other people's lives.|`|XEyV0etIaa	Yes we do sin daily but some religions say that they sin all the time. They say only because GOD didn't have any "homosexual friends." Although in my opinion we should not hate homosexual because I think that is a sin too. Hating is (in my opinion) a sin. I don't hate homosexuals. They don't do anything to bother me anyway.|`|0z8XHKxuaa	Why do some of these self proclaimed "homosexuals" make a point of advertising their sin to the world and declare that they are in no need of repentance ?    As a Christian, I sin every single day ; and one of my greatest sin is condoning the sins of others because I am too cowardly to confront others ; I have never saved any soul and probably never will (after all it is God's department) but I will continue to proclaim the Truth because when I was a child this Truth was denied from me and I suffered great loss because of this. Eating bacon and shrimp is not a sin as the ban on impure foods was lifted with Peter's Vision (you should try reading the New Testament too). When a married man involves himself in adultery he usually does not advertise it. The self proclaimed homosexuals on the other hand seem quite pleased with the political visibility they are getting ; they elbow their way under this magnifying glass you are disapproving. Finally, to charitably confront the sins of others is not judgment ; it is an obligation as a faithful Christian ; one that if not met we will have to answer to God for.|`|0fYzvVk2aa	You are right in that we are not called to judge.  I think the media has portrayed Christians as people who are intentionally going after gays and intruding on their lives, when in reality most Christians are just refusing to say that it's not a sin to practice homosexuality.  Most Christians I know clearly see the distiction of the sin versus the sinner (i.e: hate the sin, love the sinner).         Additionally homosexuality differs from many other sins becuase it is now portrayed as a "lifestyle" by many gays themselves, it's promoted in Gay Pride parades, in clubs and organizations and on TV and other places in the media. And the Bible explains that our sexuality is sacred and that sexual sins are sins against God. Also, in a natural wold, if everyone practiced homosexuality only the human race would die out in one generation. No more being fruitful and multiplying.  And if people practciced bisexuality then that means they have to have at least two partners in their lifetime, so there goes the tradition of having one partern in life, i.e., a marriage.     It also scares a lot of people because they beleive it's important for families (children) to have that male/female balance in their lives.      I don't think us Christians are called to go around being hostile or judgmental under any circumnstances, but at the same time we ARE called to stick by what the Bible teaches and not compromise our beliefs or lie to ourselves and the world about what God considers a sin for the sake of popularity or to not hurt feelings.       There may be some Christians who break these rules but I personally see a lot more gays and defenders of gays getting offended at Christians who are unwilling to compromise their beliefs for the sake of making everyone feel warm and fuzzy about their sin of choice.    Good question! =)|`|s40sgQ45aa	You ask a question, 'Why do SOME Christians make a point of telling gays they sin & need to repent?, and at the same time condemning us by saying 'Why do SOME Christians make a point of telling gays they sin & need to repent?'  What gives?        Sin is sin regardless if it is homosexuality, stealing, lying, cheating, murder etc....  Sin is sin period.  As children of God's we are to cast out sin.  If we willingly know we are sinning we are to turn from it.  The bible God's words shows us what are sins.  Homosexuality is an abomination to God.     Lev 18:22   Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it [is] abomination.     Abomination  1) a disgusting thing, abomination, abominable  ...a) in ritual sense (of unclean food, idols, mixed marriages)  ...b) in ethical sense (of wickedness etc)      1  : something abominable   2  : extreme disgust and hatred : loathing      We know the wages of sin is death.    Rom 6:23   For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.     Homosexuals are only one of many that will not inherit the kingdom of God.    1Cr 6:9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,    Those who were not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire....  Notice liars are there too.       Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.     We are to be converted if we are to enter into the kingdom of heaven    Mat 18:3   And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.    The gift of God is eternal life.......    Rom 6:23   For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.    PLEASE NOTE: I am not making 'a point of telling gays they sin & need to repent.'  Remember YOU asked the question.     To answer your other question 'Doesn't the Bible say, "Judge not lest ye be judged"?'    Jhn 7:24   Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.    EDIT:  So with your understanding concerning 'abomination' then you should have no real problem interpreting how wrong it is for man to have sex with man/woman with woman...     Lev 18:22   Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it [is] abomination.|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	wow, ur question is long.  i will answer only the last part.  cos i think that religious people in general fear that thinking for themselves is wrong, and feel the need to refer to the book which was written 100s years ago and is clearly outdated and small minded.|`|G9VBTg47aa	"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone", I want stones thrown at me right now! C'mon Jesus you blasphemer!|`|eAMq1iBWaa	You make some valid points.    "I know how to read the Bible, know what's in it, and know how to locate the Church."    But are you saved?    Jhn 3:1   After dark one evening, a Jewish religious leader named Nicodemus, a Pharisee,    Jhn 3:2   came to speak with Jesus. "Teacher," he said, "we all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs are proof enough that God is with you."    Jhn 3:3   Jesus replied, "I assure you, unless you are born again,[fn1] you can never see the Kingdom of God."    Jhn 3:4   "What do you mean?" exclaimed Nicodemus. "How can an old man go back into his mother's womb and be born again?"    Jhn 3:5   Jesus replied, "The truth is, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit.[fn2]    Jhn 3:6   Humans can reproduce only human life, but the Holy Spirit gives new life from heaven.    Jhn 3:7   So don't be surprised at my statement that you[fn3] must be born again.    Jhn 3:8   Just as you can hear the wind but can't tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can't explain how people are born of the Spirit."|`|fEkKuGlEaa	They are obsessed with gay people apparently.     Some are just disgusted at the thought of same sex intercourse. Some are repressed homosexuals, apparently. Some have been falsely taught that homosexuality is the unpardonable sin and really think they are trying to help.    And I think a portion just like to have somebody they can rationalize spite and hatred for.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	     Yep, and we admit it. That's the key difference. You have to accept that there are some things you do that are called sin.

GAY MARRIAGE.     Marriage IS a religious ceremony whether they like it or not that goes all the way back to the Pagan days.    personally, your gay? fine who cares. you throw it in my face, THEN ill blast you. otherwise, i have alot of gay friends.I dont speak less they ask. If they ask, ill tell em how i feel.    otherwise we have other common interests that allows us to hang and BS|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Because they think that homosexuals are icky.     And I think there are a more than a handful of closet cases that feed the fire out of fear, convincing their fellow Christian its what God is saying and not just their fear of their feelings.|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	Exactly.  Maybe they will be the ones facing a judgment.  Maybe they will get reincarnated as a gay to see how it feels.|`|IYBTmH26aa	You are correct and bring up a very good point.  All are sinners.  If we are to be forgiven, we are to forgive.  If we are to be worthy of the Kingdom of God, we are to repent, i.e. change our ways.     it's the same reason why Jesus asked why we bother about the splinter in our brother's eyes when we forget about the log in our own.     God also commands that we do not proselytize His word.  We are to simply keep His commandments, but we can admonish bad behavior and exact correction.  It's hard to do when you're not setting the right example.      Judgment is not what we think it is.  We tend to confuse it with criticism and admonishment.  Judgment that God is talking about is condemnation to the Lake of Fire at the end of the Millennial Peace.   God will burn up the Devil, the Beast and any other of his agents in a humungous lake of fire.    Only God has the authority to condemn.  That would be like working in in the mail room at Microsoft but making decisions that belong to Bill Gates.  It's not our place.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	It's a cultural phenomena. There are many reasons. And one is just like a school yard bully they use it to get popularity. And your right it's a levitical law not a law from God. So by that standard you are right again, if you eat shrimp you go to hell too.|`|3nw2Pwu8aa	I'm not convinced you do know how to read the bible, you know SOME things that are in it, but so do most people who aren't christians.  The bible says "judge not lest ye be judged by the same measure" I guess some people are comfortable with being judged by the same measure, especially if they're not gay.    Yes bacon, and other things were prohibited in the OT, but if you did know the NT you would know that things changed    Why should gay people get married?? Marriage is for a man and a woman, even an evolutionist would have to agree that homosexuality is wrong as it's un-natural. Being gay is a choice...a choice to be sinful, end of story, don't believe that "i was born this way" garbage|`|4boTYkt7aa	You have to admit that you have sinned,to get forgiveness.Just because you pretend that something is not a sin,doesn't take away the fact that it is.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Only when the Christian is purged and ready for preaching should they go out into the world and teach the word. They should never tell someone to repent, but to tell them about the love of GOD. We know that homosexuality is a sin, just like fornication, so therefore can someone who claims to be a christian tell someone not to do something that they do themselves?    God be blessed in as much as I am aware I have shed the world altogether in the grace and mercy that he has given me. Homosexuals make themselves a target because they oft say that it is Gods will they are gay, and this is a LIE.    I know a few gay people and I dont tell them to repent, but I do not hang with them nor do I agree with their lifestyle, and if we talk about the LORD and they go off into how he made them, I be quiet, no need to fight. Just be content in the knowledge that you have.    Cant preach unless you are not involved in sins yourself.    Be like the button that we must click and SUBMIT!

6xyeYjkkaa	If the flower blooms once a year then it isn't once every other season as that would mean it blooms twice a year. Once every other season would mean that if it bloomed in the spring season then it would skip the summer season and bloom again in the fall season. Once a year would be once every fourth season. There are some plants which blossom once every two years. They would be said to bloom once every other year.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Firstly, it is "season" (singular) and "once":    "The flower blooms only once every other season."    Another example would be:  "I check my mail once every other day."  Which means I check it Monday, then Wednesday, then Friday, etc.    If a flower blooms once a year, then: "The flower blooms every Spring." or "The flower blooms every Autumn." or  "The flower blooms every April."    If a flower blooms every 6 months, you could say that  "The flower blooms twice a year." or "The flower blooms twice yearly."|`|9Qd1XQZNaa	If the flower blossoms once a year, you may not use any form of the phrase "once every other season". You should say, "it blossoms annually". If the frequency is every 6 months, you could say, "The flower blooms only once, every other season". "The flower blooms only biannually", would be preferable.    ***EDIT: Yes, your revised example "does" mean twice a year.   .

KszocgnSaa	I think you should just go over there. It may be uncomfortable but you have to give it a chance like she said you have to work up.

I know its easier said then done.|`|RXS9K18Faa	no your not being stupid. but its not your fault that her parents hate you its her parents fault. you are going to have to try and get her parents to trust you or like you again.  and she has to be willing to make this relationship to work. I can see you are trying to make this relationship work but she isn't trying as much. You have to make her want to try and work to make your relationship better. I think she has good intentions. She wants to come to your house and work your way up. I think you should take her up on that deal and see where it goes from there.    Good luck =)    Edit:  oh i'm sorry about that. then why don't you do the same thing that i said but make it fit for your situation lol     i'm so sorry i am trying to help.|`|Vu726Q18aa	no not at all|`|TZgVwGzeaa	OK... I will do my best!  This is just my opinion based on the above conversation and nothing else...I don't really have enough to go on.  But anyway...I really think that you should go to her home where her mother is...(don't get mad..lol) I just think that you are probably a very good trustworthy person and unfortunately by you not going over to your g/f's home, it just gives her mother more reason not to trust you.  If she sees more of you...she may grow to like and trust you.  Does it suck?  Sure does...but these are the sacrifices that you have to make to be with the one you love.  It isn't your g/f's fault...she is kind of in the middle and she should not have to choose.  It seems like she loves you and wants this to work out.  Just try it...and see what happens or else, down the line, you may regret it.  Family is important to people and unfortunately not all families are such a joy...lol.

If you become a mother, you would understand.|`|mxu1mzgqaa	i got a little confused...but i think that it would not be good to go somewhere that you do not feel comfortable. her mom does not have to like you for you to be with her. i don't see anything wrong with the things that you have said. i don't see anything that would provoke her.|`|P2kL3apWaa	You aren't stupid.  I'd say more like you are tired.  Give yourself some time to think through things like :  how hard are you willing to work to make your relationship last and do you need a break.  You've been through so much trying to work things out.  I think you may be feeling like you're doing all the work and she isn't.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  It just seems that way to me.    I think the more time you spend with her mom, the better chance you both have getting to know each other.  She will be able to see that you aren't the big bad wolf and hopefully you'll see she's not the enemy keeping you from your girlfriend.    sending you lots of hugs and some cookies...hoping it all works out well for you.|`|J4SHz2bTaa	your not being stupid but it would be wise to fid out why the mother doesn't trust you  ask to have an adult conversation and remember to keep your cool  good luck  *gives ice-cream cake and hugs*|`|Bq0n1i39aa	No,Mr. Panda, I think that you are just scared to talk to your girlfriend's mom.I would just hope for the best and just be nice to Clarissa's mom and give her respect.

io2HsUEKaa	Your question is...Is this person trying to convert me?  The answer is more complicated than yes or no. In the Krsna conscious or bhakti yoga tradition, particularly with the hare krsnas, their goal is a movement is to...and i quote,  "Inundate the world with kirtan, wherein true love (prema bhakti) can be developed within the hearts of all living beings".  There are bhakti yoga traditions where personal self introspection or meditation are the highest goal. With hare krsnas it is seen as the most loving compassionate interaction, when one encourages the development of a philosophical mind centered around developing bhakti, or a loving, serving mood to God in another person.  So in a sense, it may be that the person is trying to convert your Behaviors...but not you. You are a self-realized soul, full, complete, eternal, within the carriage of this temporary human body. So...they are not trying to convert you...they simply wish to encourage behavior within you that will unfold and nurture the seed of True Love.  You can very honestly express that you simply enjoy the kirtan and bhakti yoga events, and i'm sure they won't take offense. Just enjoy the transcendental sound, and if you eventually develop a desire to learn more or participate more, then you can do that at your own pace.  Its your own journey...enjoy it   :)|`|NlzlBV8Haa	Well it seems natural enough to me - you've been going to their events and he's thinking you might want to make a deeper commitment.    Of course, you are wrong as Jesus is the only way to the Father, but that's yours to discover?

a4G1HubIaa	Everyone who is gay, is born that way. It just takes different people to realize it at different times in their lives. My mom uses the word "decision" a lot when she talks about me being gay, and it really bothers me too. But in my heart I know this is who I am, who I've always been, and who I will forever be. Some people will never accept it, and others it just takes time. I don't think there's a way to convince your aunt. I think you should just let her think what she wants to think. If you show her that her opinion doesn't matter to you, or make you feel like any lesser of a person, she will eventually come to the realization that this is who you really are. You are strong, you are brave, and you are gay. Be proud. Flaunt it. :)|`|x7uRjwseaa	Oh I am sorry hon, it seems like your aunt is not ready to listen to your side of the story right now.

Something new is coming, but we've misinterpreted it as "we're all going to die!"    thats what i think personally|`|3m00lxxuaa	OHHHHH NOOOOOO!!!!!!!! Just kidding. Not worried about it. I think it's just another hype that people are jumping on, like the "Divinci Code" was.|`|raEUval8aa	Many of the theories have been disproved, most involving a sudden shift in the Earth's magnetic field, or Planet X entering out solar system.    This has narrowed down the possibilities to more positive outlooks, like several predictions or attaining a new level of self awareness and consciousness|`|JidCNnsNaa	I don't think it will end in 2012. May be sooner, may be later, may actually be sometime in 2012 (They base it on the polar shift or somthing like that, I base mine on when God decides for it to end), but I don't think it will end when they predict it. Says nothing about 2012 in the bible, in fact it says that no man shall no the day, so, yeah, thats my thoughts on it.    There have been so many predictions in the past, but they are forgotten the next day. LOL, the invention of the car was once a date for the end of the world.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	Well actually the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar which was made by the Maya is actually 4 years off so the end of the world would really be in 2016 but I think that is a bunch of crap.|`|35b5cce42b18603478e2fb3370a123d2aa	I like Unitarianism and do not believe in the rapture, which is just a dream by John.

This is a brave decision, facing the inevitable this way.  I know the pain of pancreatic cancer -- I had it.  It's like being in labor under your breastbone.

Hring sounds like it might be ring. Halmur probably can be found, but I do not recognize it off hand.     That is one nasty spell! I wonder how litteral it is? Where did you find it?    Contact me by email if you wish, it is always interesting to speak with another magical author!

We are of the human race compared to animals and reptiles and aquatic life, but within each species there are different kinds. For example within aquatic life there are fish, but there are like tons of different kinds of fish; Salmon, Catfish etc. They're all in the fish family, but they're different kinds of fish. Like with humans, there is black and white. They're people, but different kinds of people.

jard50Yiaa	Alchemy is both a philosophy and a practice with an aim of achieving ultimate wisdom as well as immortality, involving the improvement of the alchemist as well as the making of several substances described as possessing unusual properties. The practical aspect of alchemy generated the basics of modern inorganic chemistry, namely concerning procedures, equipment and the identification and use of many current substances.    The fundamental ideas of alchemy arose in the ancient Persian Empire. Alchemy has been thus practiced in Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Persia (Iran), India, Japan, Korea and China, in Classical Greece and Rome, in the Muslim civilizations, and then in Europe up to the 20th centuryin a complex network of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2500 years.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	Alchemy was an interesting hypothesis and definitely helped kick-start modern chemistry, but there was no truth to it.  Basically, alchemists believed (and still believe, as the case may be) that you can turn one element into another element if you apply the correct mixture, temperature, etc.  For instance, one might try the following: Mix together water, salt, copper and mercury, heat it to 200 degrees, cover for ten minutes, and when you open it up, you have gold.  Realistically, of course, you'd just have a potentially dangerous mixture that is nothing like gold.  Nowadays, we know that alchemy was faulty science, but there was a time when the practice was taken fairly seriously.|`|1f2movZZaa	A lot of alchemy has its roots in the beginnings of chemistry. "Kitchen chemistry". Most people think, without even trying it, that chemistry is a bunch of boring school crap, but you can make multicolored flames (easily, I might add), explosions, change the appearance of metals, make silver metal appear out of a transparent solution, etc. Be careful, though, because it is dangerous. Never mix bleach and ammonia, for instance. It can kill you, since one of its products is pure Chlorine gas, which once was used to kill people.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	"If you can cook, you can do alchemy"    Mark Stavish, ALCHEMY, published within the last couple years.    Excellent place to start. He really knows his stuff.
sGWVQcQmaa	I  come from a wealthy family and was raised to be charitable  always -the attitude in my family is that although you work hard to aquire your fortune, you really dont need that second bmw or whatever - ie there is no point in spending money on yourself just because you can.  I mean there comes a point where you just dont need anymore stuff!!  So yah we donate lots of money to charitable organizations because we feel like we have an obligation to help others who are less fortunate.  I think it would be selfish not to help ppl when you have money.   My dad just donated a bunch of money to the local humane society so that all those cats and dogs can have better lives.  i am often outraged by the selfishness of many other wealthy families that we are aqiainted with.  They think its silly that we give away so much money but i think its a necessity.|`|a66nvk0taa	We Europeans do this. But in the USA they call us communist lol|`|4m3z1ztEaa	Fine! give to the poor! why don't you just give all your belongings to government and let it decide what to do with you!

It's certainly not up to the government to dictate how much money rich people give to the poor.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes I do.|`|N1ot1wpRaa	I don't think there should be such a big gap between rich and poor in the first place...  The thing is, this 'giving' nature will never catch on properly with the super rich because it is this Capitalist society that is giving them the money in the first place, keeping the rich very rich and the poor very poor|`|WXCa8zQoaa	my family doesn't have much but when we get the chance we try and help people so why can't people with more money than me help out since my family can and we don't have a lot of money
XpaLyWYOaa	My guess is they are trying to get a reaction out of us. They know the U.S. is strong united. If they play on our differences, like Republicans vs. Democrats for example, (we all know how heated debates can get between political parties) they rip us apart like feuding children. We all to often forget that we are Americans and should support our government and President regardless of his political party once he's in office. We have a right to our opinions and to disagree with the president and with each other. But I think calling opposing parties names and "un-american" and all round just not respecting each others different opinions is quite childish and really does weaken us as a nation.     We shouldn't care what they say and move on and try not to act like babies towards each other so what they say isn't true.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	If we portray weakness, we will be taken down by those who wish to take us down.|`|AoepHvNPaa	i worry when i see the word muslims it scares me alote.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	becasue we are who we are you are just mostly honest people and that is why. i woudn't sweat the small stuff and those muslims are soemthign else not all of them mind you so just go about your business and ignore them most of us do they are mostly obnoxious any how and who cares what they say like the saying goes sticks and stone may break my bones but names will never hurt me.|`|yegDdZfRaa	America voted a weakling into office.

I bet if you don't call or text for 3 days, he'll call just to see what you're up to.  If he wants to hook up, set an alternate date because you have something else to do at the time he wants to me.  If he doesn't call or text in 3 days, that means he's busy with his life.  Get busy with yours.    Good Luck.|`|FzLVbwGlaa	i think you're overreacting, it's not bad, tho!

Volunteer to help others, like meals-on-wheels, habitant for humanity, or help young children learn to read. Take your mind off of yourself.

Too many people have been mislead into thinking that taking care of the planet consists of adopting a few politically correct measures dictated to the population through scientists and other so-called experts who have been accredited by the system.  Common sense has not been given a large enough role.  I feel that in order to tackle the problem of the destruction of the planet, the first measures have to be taken from the level of the inner core of the individual.  We need to first alter the patterns in our thinking and in our general behaviour towards one another and consider the ways in which we are not only taking from the earth but from one another.|`|A01w1dHqaa	In fear we give up our power to others or to the natural world or think we do .Right thinking cannot take place in an atmosphere of fear.The supposition that the world will destroy us seems to make us the effect of something foreign and fearful.

This applies not only to our pollution levels, but sociologically and morally, we will destroy ourselves if we do not put in check our avarice, greed, violence, and general wickedness.  In an age of religious sensitivity we are hesitant to label something as "wicked" for fear of how we may be viewed as insensitive, demeaning or religiously paranoid.  The truth be told, there are things which are good for humanity and things which are evil, irrespective of our religious ?or non-religious ?views.    If we act the way we have for millions of years, who is to say that the Earth really would want us to "save" her only to continue polluting her face (and I mean by our acts, not our emissions)?  Maybe she is looking for a break from our warlike and destructive ways.  I say, let us save ourselves:  if we do that, we will "save" the earth as a natural byproduct.|`|WW7hHBDTaa	In order to save, or at least preserve, what is beautiful and healthy about the planet requires conservation.

LOOK, AT WHAT IS COMING.  WHICH IS WHAT.  I DON'T KNOW, AND AS I WONT BE HERE TO SEE IT, GET HERE.,  I DON'T CARE.|`|IFQFt25naa	Mottos are nice, but Ive always had this silly idea that they really dont accomplish much of anything.  Unless people are willing to change we can have all the mottos, songs, or anything else and it is not going to make a difference if we continue doing the same things.    Sadly a lot of the worlds destruction is driven by greed.  The desire by groups to make a few billion, rather than simply a few million.  For there are cost effective ways to help the planet but alas those methods are not as profitable, or as I was told, can not be controlled by the industry so often are not pursued.   Or in the USA (as well as other countries) the solutions are often made non-cost effective by fees and licenses one must obtain to produce realistic solutions.    (If anyone wants a real life example, from personal experience, Ill be glad to share one with you.  Just email me.)    But to answer your question, I think the old saying that says:  Actions speak louder than words.  Applies heavily to any Save the World motto.    We can ALL either do something about it or we can ALL go down chanting the slogans, mottos and singing the songs.    May Our Creator watch over you and your family.

AA10665732	I personally would not consider this person a friend at all. No friend who is a true friend would allow another person to hurt themselves at all. He is not a friend. I really hope that Obie gets better.  I myself do not believe in getting revenge because when you do so most of the time it just turns into a cycle of each other trying to seek revenge on each other.     Best Wishes!|`|AA10601065	Taking everything you said at face value, the guy who turned his back on your friend is NO FRIEND AT ALL. I say this because: Your friend had a very bad life before he met you. Things were looking up since he met you because you cared and wanted to take care of him. He met this guy, and when a problem came up, this guy turned his back on your friend. As a result, your friend was thrust back into bad feelings from the past and it pushed his limits to the point that he is now in a coma. Why are you even asking this question? This guy should be punished for what he did to your friend. If I was in your shoes, I'd open my mouth big and wide and be out there telling everybody who would listen to me what a truly evil person this guy turned out to be. I would even go so far as to tell his family what happened. Screw what could come back on me for doing something like this. If he pushed your friend to the point of trying to kill himself, then he is NOT a friend at all. He should be called to the carpet for his actions.|`|pd2GnHnIaa	im so sorry that im a bad friend.........  its just theres a bunch of **** going on in my life atm  and i cant deal with anyone elses problems  im just not that good around ppl who are hurting          im extremely sorry for everything that ive done|`|TJHxVwrpaa	Dang that sounds like alot of drama. That so called friend isn't a friend at all if he was willing to have your friend hurt himself, and not do a thing about it. Friends are always suppose to be there for each other, and it seems like this dude could have cared less what happened to him. As for payback, I understand that you want to avenge your friend but we have to learn how to forgive people for their actions and behaviors even if it's really wrong, because getting payback believe it or not will not make you feel better. I wish you and your friend luck.|`|w92XRGvpaa	well. . .i think that you should make him suffer because he was supposed to be a friend and friends don't let friends get hurt, i think you should inflict pain into this persons life because now Obie is in a coma all because of that person not helping him out.  if he hurt you too dont just sit bye do something about it|`|NwGDlZl1aa	ya they seem like a nice person

Au1BVCvAaa	not me|`|rYaqoPTHaa	The basis of intelligent design      Paraphrasing the creation story and approximate history until today  (Extremely old school style)    By David Watts 2/09    (Literal) Day 1 Genesis 1:1-5 states that God created the earth.  On this first day the earth was a void in space staring at the sun.  This was not the earth we know today.  No plants and animals, a complete barren ball of water as land had not yet been introduced.    (Literal) Day 2 Genesis 1:6-8 states that God separated the waters above and below.  A shield of ice or mist was introduced into the atmosphere.  The expanse between the waters was called sky and this was the second day.  Basically, this is when He made our atmosphere.    (Literal) Day 3 Genesis 1:9-13 states that God created land and divided it from the water.  The world looked somewhat Pangea like in form, as the continents were all together.  God than created all the plant life we see today.    (Literal) Day 4 Genesis 1:14-19 states that God created the stars in the sky and the moon and set the revolution of the earth in motion around the sun.  The Earth was not capable of sustaining life before this step.    (Literal) Day 5 Genesis 1:20-23 states that God created the creatures of the sea and the air and he blessed them.  Incidentally, this is the first blessing in the Bible.      (Literal) Day 6 Genesis 1:24-31 states that God created all the land animals and than humans and gave us humans dominion over the Earth and told us to take care of it.    (Literal) Day 7 Genesis 2:1-3 states that God rested on the seventh day and made it holy as an example for us to use one day a week as a day of rest.    There was about 2000 years between the great flood when the waters above came and flooded the land and creation.  Before the flood, people lived to be several hundred years old and the differing atmospheric conditions allowed for constant growth.  As for dinosaurs, there were never any different species than what we see today.  For example, if my dog never stopped growing over his 600-year life Im sure hed be as big as a house!  These truths have often been cast aside but never disproven.    During the flood the earth below the waters broke apart creating the continents we have today.  The flood also dramatically changed the atmosphere, as there is no longer water above the earth.  The new atmosphere accounts for the differing atmospheric changes and climate we see today as before the flood the earth would have been fairly temperate.    After the flood there was 2000 years before God came to Earth in the form of Jesus.  It has almost been 2000 years since Jesus came.  His return is foretold in Revelation and many prophesies about that return are being fulfilled now.

I think that there are also some who abuse the fact that many people need and want to, and do, believe in a god.    Personally, I do not believe in god(s), but there have been times in my life when I knew that if I *could* believe, things would feel easier.  I'm very afraid of death, for example.  If I believed in a god and in a heaven, there would be an elegant solution to all my questions and wonders, and I'd probably stop worrying about it.  But I don't believe.  I can't.  It doesn't seem logical to me, and it's probably just how my brain is wired.    Other people's brains are different, and I say, believe in god if it makes you feel good.

Plus multiple parallel universes. Hard to swallow ain't it........ even in our "modern" existance!  Maybe someday we will know and truly explain these 11 dimensions.  But to instantly label them as impossible seems to be an act someone with out a lotta brain power might jump to.  We all know evolution is what is happening. But it's just a tool in the greatest design we'll ever know..Life!  Compared to the odds of "Just happened" For a lack of understanding most things, I should win a lottery every week!

Recent trends in international and bulgarian istoriografics - there are links between the Bulgarian and ancient Iranian culture.   According to new insights about the world of the ancient Bulgarians antropologic researchers determined the type of ancient Bulgarians as predominantly pamir-fergan. Bulgarian cult and palace architecture were built in eastern tradition, as there are some specific features ancient-Iranian. Today more and more researchers pay attention to the numerous Iranian expressions, remained in the Bulgarian language / system of consanguinity, business terminology, etc. antroponimiyata., And its grammatical features non-slav still have not historical explanation.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxckeS0qB...    The origin of the Hungarians so far not been clarified. The oldest theory of huns origin now rejected by most scientists. There are also almost unanimously agreed that the Finno-Ugrian origin of the Hungarian language does not mean the genetic relationship of the Hungarians in Finno-Ugrian peoples. Cultural and genetic studies indicate the most probable homeland of Hungarians is today's Western Region Chinese Hsinchiang (Uyguriya). For the first time, Hungarians (or Madjares) is now settled in Hungary in 670, but failed to establish permanent unity government. The second wave of Hungarians in Transylvania is settled and Panonia over 895 years as a result of war with Bulgaria Tsar Simeon I.

MSORDfOKaa	Easter is called a moveable feast because the date of Easter changes every year. Easter Sunday can fall on any date from 22 March to 25 April.  The reason for this variation in the date of Easter is based on the lunar calendar (moon) rather than our more well-known solar one.   Easter always falls on the first Sunday following the full Moon (the Paschal Full Moon) after 21 March. If the Full Moon falls on a Sunday then Easter is the next Sunday.  The Easter Season begins on Easter Day and lasts 50 days, ending on Pentecost.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	It's the first sunday, after the first full moon, which is after the vernal equinox.|`|R6pfYeioaa	Good Friday arrives on the first Friday that arrives after the first full moon that arrived after the first day of Spring and then the following Sunday after Good Friday is Easter Sunday.|`|NBO4q2wQaa	leap year|`|etMuDCQVaa	its the first sunday based on the lunar months|`|AA10286634	It is tied to the moon and the moon refuses to stay still.|`|OOtme2jkaa	leap year!!=]|`|Xverqpu4aa	Easter and the associated holidays do not fall on fixed dates because they follow the Jewish Lunar Calendar and not the Solar Gregorian Calendar.

The bible tells us that Christ died and rose again around the time of the Jewish Passover. Hence early Christians, many of whom were originally Jews, celebrated Easter at the same time as the Jewish Passover. Christians, however, celebrated Christ every Sunday so many of them celebrated Easter, not exactly at Passover but on the Sunday following. This became the custom of the Church following the Council of Nicaea in the early 4th century. It was nothing to do with paganism.    The Jews use a lunar calendar - each month begins with a new moon. Passover is on the 14th Nissan - the first month of spring so Passover is always 14 days after the first full moon of spring. However, Jews in different countries saw the new moon on different days so celebrated Passover on different days. The Church wanted everyone to celebrate Easter on the SAME day so it came up with its own independent formula which was the same everywhere    1. Easter falls on the first Sunday following the first ecclesiastical full moon that occurs on or after the day of the vernal equinox;   2. this particular ecclesiastical full moon is the 14th day of a tabular lunation (new moon); and   3. the vernal equinox is fixed as March 21.     The RC church now uses the Astronomical full moon as observed from Jerusalem.|`|eR14nyPRaa	For detailed info about Easter visit http://www.squidoo.com/everything-about-...|`|68LTH2q2aa	Its a  bit random really like once my friend had his b day it was on a saturday next year a wednesday So i dont really know just remember easter as a happy time :)|`|doxZYj0raa	Because of the febuary leap year  (29th feb)|`|4UhSsISBaa	cause it wants to  thats actually.. a good question.  i think its something to do with the months? ahh no idea sorry|`|JjbragXNaa	Because it's always on a Sunday.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Because it's a complicated algorithm set by the Catholic Church (when they had time on their hands) that involves moon phases.|`|PMR7RovEaa	it's just like the super bowl. it has too be on sunday. Sunday is when the whole easter event happened.|`|HXr2Qeiraa	Based on a lunar cycle and the 1st day of spring. Just another reminder that most Christian holidays have deep pagan roots.|`|HLUrB8NVaa	Easter is always the second Sunday, that never changes, like mother's day. Although the kings that "placed" all the holidays, selected the dates to appease the pagans, who celebrated the advent of Spring, the growing season, around the same time of year. The original church wanted to be sure to celebrate Easter on a Sunday to insure church attendance.     Plus, Christmas is also a fake holiday date, not because Christ is fake, but again wanting to get Pagans into their churches to increase their numbers. Winter equinox was a big Pagan holiday already taking place at that time.  Given that the books referring to Christ's birth and death were written 350+ years after his death, accuracy should not be expected.    At this point in time, holidays are selected for the convenience of the government and business and no longer represent the real sentiment behind ritual celebration.|`|DLcS15Uaaa	im not sure sorry, all i know that it is on my birthday :] april 12th.

McKinley was killed in 1901 - someone 110 years old now was only two when President McKinley was shot.  Vice-President Teddy Rosevelt after being assured that McKinley would recover had gone on a planned vacation in the Adirondacks near the southern slopes of Mt. Marcy (the highest peak in the Adirondacks)  when McKinlely took a trun for the worse telegrams were sent to have Rosevelt return to Buffalo.  He was tranported from the place he was staying near Newcomb NY to North Creek, NY by a series of four horse and buggies teams and drivers across Mt. roads to the train  station   When he arrived in North Creek work had arrived that President McKinley had died and Roosevelt took the oath of office on the train platform in North Creek, NY by a local judge.   He later took the oath again in a public ceremony|`|to8CkYp2aa	OMG! They shot McKinley?|`|8yE2sYGeaa	OK, anyone who was alive when it happened (1901) is dead.    You could easliy work up a tale of someone who was there, but also keep in mind that McKinkey was only shot, but doctor incopmpetance prevented them from doing exploratory surgery to discover his stomach had been perforated, his kidney nicked and his pancreas damaged.    he died six days later|`|YUAegpPoaa	Second or third grade social studies class I believe.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	I was not yet even a twinkle in my parent's eyes.|`|AA10860286	I was with him at his bedside when he died.

1TYZDRUqaa	You, personnally, have to go downtown and remove them?  How did you get that job?  But seriously, you can keep all that stuff up if you want.  Just let the Muslims put up a symbol of thier faith, and let the Atheists put up a symbol.  It's about fairness.  We don't want you to take down your symbols, we want you to let us put ours up.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	It is in poor taste and we should always do our best to keep poor taste out of the public view.  You want a stone with commandments on it, put one in your yard.  You want to pray, pray at home or at church, mosque, synagogue or whatever but not in public, that would be akin to passing gas and shows a total lack of manners.  There are some people that feel it is unfair that they can't fornicate in public and my answer is the same.  Keep your private life private and away from the rest of us.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	Separation of church and state.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Hey y'all!    We can only hope they take all of those things down.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	Because your religion is NOT the only religion out there. You have no right to force it down others throats.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	Not everyone is a Christian.  There are Jews, Muslim, Buddhists, Hindus, Atheist etc. all throughout America attending schools.  If you want crosses in your classroom than why not attend a Christian school?|`|wywdxhBAaa	Separation of church and state is a farce.  If this were true, then why do we have cities named Sacramento (Sacrament), St. Louis, Los Angeles (City of the Angeles of the Queen of Heaven), San Jose, San Francisco, St. Augustine, San Antonio, Santa Cruz (Holy Cross), Corpus Christi (Body of Christ), etc.?    The Liberal-Leftist-Socialists have hijacked America and forced down our throats Jefferson's words (which are NOT in the Constitution) twisting them into "separation of church FROM state", which he NEVER intended.  Originally, Jefferson used these words in a private letter to the governor of Massachusetts to discourage the establishment of a state recognized religion, in this case turning Massachusetts into a Catholic State, and that was all that was intended... NOT to use his words to isolate religious activities from governmental activities, because as the third president he signed legislation to BUILD CHURCHES ACROSS THE FRONTIER LANDS to bring civility to those wild and unruly areas, AND IT WAS PAID BY AMERICA TAXPAYER MONIES.    These Liberal idiots today are CLUELESS.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Religious displays sponsored by citizens are allowed anyplace other displays are allowed by citizens.  Student initiated prayer is allowed in schools.  Any school that funds student-led groups or clubs must provide comparable resources, such as a room after school,  to a Bible study or other religious group as would be provided to any non-religious student group.    Tragically, the amendment of the U.S. constitution concerning religion gets attention for only half of what it says.     The free exercise of religion is a protected right under the American constitution.    Stand up for your rights, and when a government agent or agency tries to trample your rights,  fight back.  And contact the organization below for help and information.    EDIT:  If we had a voucher system that gave parents the right to send their children to any school - public or private, this problem would be solved.  Parents who choose to send their children to a non-public school should get the money that the public school system saves by not having to educate those children.  That way parents could more freely choose where and how their children would be educated.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	They shouldn't be in "public" to begin with, if by "public" you mean government-controlled buildings like schools, courthouses, etc. This country was founded in part on the idea that people should be free to worship whomever or whatever they choose as long as it doesn't hurt others, and displaying the tenet of a particular religion infringes on the rights of people who don't belong to that religion.    Creationism shouldn't be in any school, because it isn't science. Religion and science are separate, NOT conflicting, things, with different purposes.    It's completely fair, then, that religious material isn't in public schools. Most schools teach a universal code of ethics to young children based on ideas like fairness and honesty. Any further moral codes should be formed at home and in the child's own explorations.|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	Because one of the principles of the United States of America is Freedom of Religion.  One of the effects of this is that the Government should not give even the appearance of favoring one religion over another.    This is the foundation of the principle of Separation of Church and State.  No religion is suppressed; but that also means that no religion can be promoted, or have the appearance of being promoted, over any other religion.  .|`|czf6uhIraa	To give children a better chance.

It is the so called Christians who won't stand up for truth. It is the 1st amendment.

But then the Bible already predicted this saying the church will fall. So now it is up to you as an individual to keep fighting.|`|teeQmWsBaa	Separation of Church and State was meant to keep government from giving privilege to a "one" religion, which is done giving favor to Secular Humanism.  Are the children healthier? Previous generations never had hyperactive, ADHD children. Test scores in all levels have bottomed. Do you really think things are better with your method?|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	My pary are with the father who lost his chrilden.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I assume you are talking about the U.S.A.    Public display is fine.  Put up a big 10 commandment monument in front of your church and no one will make a peep.    Display on government property is what is forbidden, because that implies that the government is saying your display is truth, and better than the things people with other faiths think.  And the constitution forbids the government doing that.    Same reason public schools (government run) cannot favor a particular religion over all others.  Open a private school, and you can lead prayers all day and teach creationism or whatever damn fool thing you like.  There are lots of those.  Up through university level.    You religion is your business and the government must stay out of it.  But, in return for that right to not have the government telling you what your religion should be, you must also keep your religion out of the government or it will end up telling others what they must believe. And that's not fair.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|uxfacsgmaa	I got it! You're trolling.

QaEZd14Vaa	You have forgotten those of us that see spirits often and accept them as a part of our lives.      Every person is like a radio...the "normal" person picks up frequencies in a very limited range...then some pick up frequencies above or below what is called "normal" that is when they see spirits.  It is not a case of chance spotting but of expanding the range of senses to out side of the "normal" range...because few challenge what is considered "normal" those who pick up other frequencies are seen as crazy...    I can't remember the first time I saw a spirit because they have always been around.  Animals as well as human.  They are not scary or dead just different.  I think it would more scary to be without them and weird.  My home would seem empty and life less colorful.  I also don't see them as much as feel them around.      May you be blessed.|`|fpHblEtAaa	I think because the person does not realize what's happening, or if your  like in a dream. This could happen for the first time for some people and maybe no body knows how to react to spirits or ghosts.. sometimes it can be a trance and you might not move until it's over! There can be alot of reasons! ;)|`|kkO92mWfaa	It's because humans are born and raised on the basis that supernatural creatures do not exist, so they go on through the span of their lives with the belief that everything is logical and scientific--that God and angels and such are the only supernatural beings. But when they actually see a supernatural or paranormal creature firsthand, they freak out and their mind tries to interpret what they are seeing, but their lack of belief and knowledge sort of numbs their mind and they are powerless. Humans, pitiful things.|`|0l9YOgkBaa	It goes to mankind's primate belief in the paranormal .|`|W05lqxGHaa	because they can believe that they actually seen it ...i mean me too would be so shocked if i see one coz i havent seen one either...|`|oSzACmfmaa	Well, probably because most people thinks that there is a 'rationalized' explanation for everything that happens, and spirits, whether they be ghosts, angels or demons, can't always be explained. At least, not what people call 'rationally'.    I've seen ghosts before, about 5 or 6 times. Most of the time, I just feel them. Like a few days ago, I was at the Cleveland Summit (used to be called the Cherokee Hotel) visiting someone, and I felt two people standing beside me. They were getting irritated, because I was standing between them. I am really never confused with spirits because I've felt them many times.|`|4cLuS7zAaa	I have seen the ghosts of people that were still alive. They lived for many years after I saw them. My brother has seen the ghosts of live people as well. So, explain that. If they were dead I would have said I'd seen a ghost!|`|1wNsBNmxaa	it would be like a person freaking out saying they seen a bigfoot are a werewolf or something         D?mon~~?|`|p7wnI6Jxaa	Thats like asking "Why would you be scared, all you saw was a dead rabbit in your chair, even though you have never had a rabbit!" Its not commen to fid a dead unknow rabbit in your chair, is it? It's also uncommon to see a ghost, most people would be freaked if they saw a deceased unknow person. A deceased know person is even scarier.|`|i48kxrbaaa	.......it's uncommon maybe?    It's like asking why would anyone freak out seeing an alien from another planet....|`|dieDR1sWaa	I think you answered your own question, but since childhood, were told ghost, spectre's, spirits,poltergeistt, etc.don'tt exist. its our culture that shuts down our minds and creativity. I believe that everyone has seen a spirit before, their mind just naturally tries to disprove what they just saw. When it becomes unexplainable other then it is in fact a spirit, its when we become confused and shocked.|`|rkadldDcaa	people i think he was stating an opinion :]    BUT i have never seen a ghost when i was in contact with anything creepy i was never alowd to open my eyes...  My grandma died before i was born and at the time a thought it was santa but now i have different views ANYWAYS!  It was christmas eve (hence why i thought it was santa) but i was sleeping NOWHERE near the tree and i was held by some fur like and i couldnt open my eyes but threw them i saw the christmas lights but i wasnt scared.. i just wished i could see its face ):    This one creaped me out! so when i went to church that morning my little friend who is 7 was playing bible school songs (if u wanna go swimming in the river of life u gotta jump right in with all ur you gotta jump jump jump right into the love of teh Lord) well that night i blacked out when i way laying down. i couldnt move open my eyes ANYTHING! all i heard was that song liek echoing. i was scared i didnt wanna go back to sleep

No, income maybe yes and maybe no but I am willing to bet the Church does far more charitable works with that money. And by the way why ask a question such as this and block Catholics?|`|TneDU9R3aa	who cares.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	definitely not, they may have assets like art and buildings which every other country in the world has , but monetary wise the year 07-08 was the first time for years the vatican had a surplus,when you consider the charities they run world wide that was a surprise|`|7nbqb4e2aa	The topic of the Catholic Church collecting money for the purpose of wealth/greed is one of the most stupid ignoramus topics in the world... The Catholic Church hierarchy is made up of priests/deacons/nuns/etc, then above them are bishops/cardinals/pope (kind of like me, except his religion actually has other people in it)... They ALL have the vow of poverty, and eat simple food (often purposely without enough salt), and usually live in small apartments (sometimes tiny ones) with little decoration, and certainly no "extras"...    What do people think the bishops/cardinals/pope in the Vatican DO "after work"? Put on their golden slippers, and turn on a big screen TV to watch wrestling, while drinking campaign on a velvet couch?    There ARE a few expensive properties owned where Cardinals live (some of them sold to pay for the stupid "pedophile" scandal that made the world think every priest was gay or something... when only 1 in 300 was ever even convicted of anything (try even counting that high right now, paying attention to how each number UNTIL you reach 300 is a completely normal priest who did nothing at all) but even living at those giant places (which were probably used for church business, like office buildings) would have been under the vow of poverty, with no "rich living" to speak of...    The money the church collects from people "tithing" (just doing what the Bible says to do, so that people can pitch in with getting good things done) pays for things like:  - New churches (it's SUPER expensive to build modern structures that big and nice, thanks to construction companies that overcharge for anything nice-looking or big, since the people buying them don't know better)  - Helping the poor (and also regular people who go to church and need help)...  - Paying the priests/bishops/cardinals/etc a small amount, so they can live...  - Helping local disaster victims (when something happens)...  - Any other place the church decides to send money (all kinds of causes/things/etc that seem good, so they help)    Next time someone says a joke about the Catholic Church stealing people's money (or a pedophile joke), I'm going to choke them like Darth Vader, except with both hands, ON their neck...  100% Ignoramus Fools...|`|AA10398522	You bet.

I mean personally,  I can honestly tell you that in asking the question "why are we here?", I have never come to the conclusion that a talking snake tricked two people - either both made of mud or else one of mud and the other of a rib (the text is unclear), and because of that a Cosmic Debt was established that must be paid by God coming down to earth, speaking some great wise lines (some even related to the Eastern Philosophies which predated Him by at least 500 years) but then deciding the best way to inject this wisdom into the culture was by having the authorities nail Him to a cross, thereby giving up His life (or at least a weekend) in payment for this Cosmic Debt. Then, since He forgot to give some basic guidelines concerning the distribution of the wisdom, he showed up as a ghost to a fellow (which the companions either heard or didn't hear, saw or didn't see - the text is unclear) who had every reason to feel guilty about his despicable persecution of a sect for their beliefs -leading eventually to a justification for the entire religion to be codified into an instrument for the persecution of many other people who held differing beliefs. It would then therefore continue to exist today as a strict religious philosophy that somehow finds the words of it's savior only valid when convenient, ignoring absolute admonitions about divorce and re-marriage while tending to side with the ghost-seer because he can allow them to still persecute a minority like homosexuality. I would then therefore begin to believe that the world would end soon; and because of that knowledge I would not only be allowed to but be required to tell rumors and spread a load of fear-mongering gibberish because I'm going to disappear one day while driving my car.      ...but that's just me....|`|PsWzUuTtaa	you have to also criticize other beliefs since all beliefs claim their way is the right way, they cannot offer any proof. To ask for proof of the truth of christianity is to insult the intellect of rationalists everywhere. There is no proof, only faith.    EDIT: Yea there was never a messiah, your book's prophecy never came thru lol.|`|6jAVElX7aa	It is not so much religion as faith in Christ Jesus as Lord and Saviour that keeps us on the right path and He is there when are faced with trials, sorrows and temptations.|`|AA11008046	When you say Christians who are you referring to?  there are many who claim to be Christians who do not follow christ (the true meaning of Christian)  There is only one true and complete Church.  that is the church that Jesus started on earth and called the "church of Christ" (no, not the Mormons)  the church of Christ is all those who truly believe in God and His son Jesus and the Holy spirit (the trinity) and these three are one.  Believers make a church, not buildings or signs over the door.  believers in Jesus christ an Him crucified for the remission of our sins.  Believer in every Word that God had written by divine revelation in  the Bible. and so on.  Now if you do not wish to believe it all then you are not a christian; or a follower of Christ.  Jesus taught "..why call me Lord and yet you do not as I have commanded.."  That is the measuring stick.  Either you accept it ALL by faith or you do not.  Only two choices in  this matter.  It is not a smorgasboard lunch.  You can't take some of this and none of that.  You either accept it ALL or don't be bothered accepting any of it.  That is Gods order of business to the professing Christian.  Now for your question:  It amtters not to God what you call yourself, what sign is over the door on your church building, or what you carry for a Bible.  What matters to god is that you keep His commandment and that means everything that is between the covers of the Holy bible.  Everything written in there is for the spiritual growth of  the Christian and is important  to be believed.  Somethings may not be credible to you but that is only a matter of further study and you will see how it all connects and correctly so.  If you have to have any other books to support your faith then you are a false Prophet and none of His (Gods) according to Scripture.  It is o.k. to have other books supporting the teaching if they are just that - literature. They cannot be used to hold up your faith in god.  The proof is that Real Christians will live a life that is amplified by the Wod of God.  If you do not see that in the person professing to be a Christian; then he/she probably is not one.|`|VRl1jENHaa	Hundreds of fulfilled prophesies should tell you something .......

That has to be the right one, because if it depended on anything we did, we'd all be in hell, because we all sin all the time and make SO many mistakes.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Christianity is the only religion that can prove it is the one true religion. How? By inviting Jesus to be your Lord brings the Holy Spirit into your heart. The proof is in the heart and that is more evidence than you can imagine.|`|QL0FOQMmaa	Actually, every other "major religion" does not claim to be the only one. If they did, then they would not be part of the "all paths lead to God" crowd, which most are, and there would be a lot more evangelizing on their part, and yet, there is not. Christianity is the only one whose Christ is alive, having been resurrected from the dead, with over 500 witnesses over 40 days thereafter. The bones of Buddah, Mohammad and every other "leader", are still in their graves.    As far as your comments on Prophecies go, ALL Biblical prophecy was foretold (not told afterward) most of which was foretold hundreds and even thousands of years prior to the events taking place. So, what are you using for references to support your comment to Suzanne?|`|FVLgdXoUaa	I believe it.  I can't prove it, and I'm not going to claim that I can.|`|RQ83sP4paa	Christianity is the only "religion" not started by mere men.    All others are  copies in one form or other, and all rely on "works" (good deeds) for salvation. Christianity is based purely on faith. If it wasn't so, it would not be a religion.    "For we are saved by grace through faith, and not by works, lest any man should boast".    There is nothing you can do to earn the love of Christ.....it is a free gift, as is your ability to choose whether to accept it or not. I chose to accept, and pray that you do also.

The attractive stutterer is probably aware that he stutters and has been made fun of several times before. That means he is probably used to it and it doesn't bother him, or it hurts his feelings. If it hurts his feelings, he needs to realize that 1) He let other people have fun at his expense. 2) The people that he allowed himself to be hurt by are insecure with themselves. 3) His speech impediment is beyond his control.|`|tENr2EARaa	thats really horrible that they did that  they dont know why he stutters and he probably couldnt help it  i would not do that ..sounds lame but i wouldn't like it if that was done to me either|`|rThIVk2maa	Those who would demean others because of a disability are the utter dregs of society and unworthy of anything but a horrified stare and perhaps "how dare you!".|`|JQJvW4KSaa	I think it's terrible too.

BevylvVSaa	Yes.     "people with alcoholism who are substantially limited in a major life activity will have a disability under the ADA. . However, even if a person with alcoholism meets the definition of disability, an employer may discipline, discharge, or deny employment to an alcoholic whose current use of alcohol adversely affects job performance or conduct to the extent that s/he is not "qualified" (EEOC, 1992)."    http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/alcohol.htm...    http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle...|`|fAcVndo7aa	To be protected under the ADA, you must have, have a record of, or be regarded as having a substantial, as opposed to a minor, impairment. A substantial impairment is one that significantly limits or restricts a major life activity such as hearing, seeing, speaking, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for yourself, learning or working.  As far as I know, alcoholism is not classified as an impairment.   Also, you must be able to perform the essential job duties, with or without "reasonable accomodations".  I can't think of any accomodations that an employer would be able to make to enable an alcoholic to perform job duties.    People with alcoholism have been defined as individuals with a disability under this definition, but employers still have the right to deny employment, as defined in later updates to the law.    So I would say, no.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Being a mental health professional with 20+ years experience, with much of it involving alcohol and other drug abuse and dependency, I think yours is a great question.   I hate to admit I don't know the answer, but I just had to voice my opinion on your question since I worked so long and hard with people with chemical addictions.  God Bless you.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	yes, it is considered a disability--but any accommodations still need to be reasonable-maybe excused unpaid OCCASSIONAL extar absence(depending on teh job)    showing up drunk or being routinely unabble to work due to a hangover probably wouldn't need to be accommodated--    A recovering alcoholic cannot be denied a job due to their status as beign in recovering-that would be discrimination    but it doesn't really matter-unless the alcoholic is rich--i found out teh hard way--that they EEOC takes a few token cases to publicize-and screws over anyone else--    In 2005-91% of teh disability discrimination cases they were supposed to investigate were rubber stamped NO REASONABLE CAUSE--and these cases are profictable enoguh for lawyers to take on contigency--so if you can't afford a lawyer-theres not much you can do...    Even the cases that were stamped CAUSE are questionable-as it seems they were only right 50% of teh time

That's why we have white skin.|`|RgymoiIQaa	Are you sure this is about white people? Or your stupid roommate? Just wondering.

Yup all the whiteys I know got their heat on.|`|qWu5F1O2aa	im white and i wouldnt turn on the AC... go figure|`|CN7klGgbaa	Its true, you are right, most of them do go out in the cold like that. Most white people believe that withstanding extreme cold makes them look special or superhuman. Like showing off. Most of them also like the cold because they still feel their skin color is superior to dark skin and the cold enhances their pale color making them whiter. So when they look whiter they feel better that is what attracts most white people to the cold. My husband is from Russia, he hates the cold, he loves the summer weather. Some white people don't like the cold. You do not have to be from a warm country or cold country to understand that wearing little clothing in the cold can make you sick and cause severe health problems, that's just logic.|`|Cqtb3T5Xaa	Menopause|`|TLNQZ63baa	Men usually like it colder.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Skin I guess.

When we go outside for recess my white students are always begging to take their coats off, while i'm standing there freezing my you know what off.     I don't know what it is...maybe because we (black people) are decendants of Africa as well are other minorities are decendants for places with hotter climates hence the skin color, so it's in our natural to be hot and we get cold easier.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Well, it is not all white people. It is the ones that were raised farther North. They are used to a colder climate. I am from the South, I am white, and I don't run the AC in 21 degree weather. I am like you. Turn on the heat and light the fireplace. I hate extreme cold and extreme heat. We are about to get freezing temps here in Florida.

xhz1kWroaa	I have never heard of the Armenian Genocide.  What a shame...  The Holocaust does overshadow a lot of other events, especially if they happened around the same time.  I will look it up now.  I'm curious. lol    EDIT:  Whoa... This is definitely a very significant event: "It was characterised by the use of massacres, and the use of deportations involving forced marches under conditions designed to lead to the death of the deportees, with the total number of Armenian deaths generally held to have been between one and one-and-a-half million."    I can blame my World Studies and AP Euro teachers for never going over this event.  I wonder why they didn't?|`|q9PVawNyaa	Which one, there were two Armenian genocides.    I have to admit though the only reason I have heard about it is that I am doing my postgraduate thesis on genocide.|`|gnABxaKmaa	The Jewish knows their ways of marketing...

I think most people don't know about it, because schools really don't teach you about it like they do the Holocaust.  It's sad that genocides happen, but genocides been happening and it's probably going to keep happening.  It's mess up, but it's seem like there will always be someone out there who want to wipe out entire race, religion, etc they can't get along with or just don't like.

d7oz9FV6aa	Relax. I think you just need to think of him as a good friend instead of a teacher and I think that everything will be ok. Just go up to him and tell him you would like for him to mentor you.|`|JknwX64saa	Awww I think that is cute.  Maybe you can talk to him about things, that you can't talk to with other people. And he can your mentor in many ways.  And you guys will become closer.  Good Luck!!!  Hope Everything Works Out!!!|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	The same thing happened with my Sociology teacher in my first semester of college. He was SO sexy, and he had an very cute butt. I would stare at it while he was writing on the chalk board.     He told me that he really liked my name, and would say it with a wonderful inflection. I almost fainted!    Anyway...as for your problem...just talk to him after class sometimes. It'll give you a chance to connect with him (in an appropriate manner!) and you'll be more comfortable around him during class time. With you being more comfortable, you'll be able to answer his questions without stuttering.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Just laugh and say "new teachers make me nervous".      Just make your nervousness seem like it has nothing to do with attraction or being gay.

It can inspire you, let you know you are not alone; uplift, make you want to be a better person.    Ask him - or write a note - saying how you feel. Be honest, and ask that he respect your privacy; and that you'd really be over the moon if he'd agree to help you out. That you also realise he makes you go weak at the knees, but you want to develop the relationship as a mentor/student, and nothing more. (If for no other reason than a whole lot of legal stuff...)    Good luck.|`|7wqIJbPjaa	lol awee i get this problem when i talk to pretty girls too, i stutter and fumble my words all over the place :/ but hey some girls find it cute lol, maybe he does too :]     anyways just act like he is your teacher first, and let him get to know you as a student, then inch toward getting that mentor bond thing going. oh and getting good grades in his class might be some brownie points, teachers always like their best students, as long as they're not obnoxious, but you don't seem to be :p, so you'll be set. :]|`|Hf73hMI9aa	I read some of the other answers and it seems to me like they are all geared towards teacher/student relationships, which doesn't seem like what you want to know.

I guess Asian men are seen as a threat? Asian men in general are doing better than white men in America. Better jobs, better education, more money, more opportunities, more stability and closer knit in marriage and family. Right now, most of what Americans own are made in Asia, from their clothes, household goods, cars, electronics, etc. When Asian men start taking white women, it's crossing the line. What else would White Americans have in their minds? It's no wonder why the cling onto negative stereotypes of Asians in the media. I can't blame them because it seems that Asians are taking over. I don't think anybody is confident to say that US super power will last. China is the next superpower. What do Americans have right now except great weapons? It's great Obama became president, but damn, we don't make anything here anymore.|`|IJgif2Czaa	it's not normal because many women don't give asian men a chance.
dnA6sAFqaa	Swedish is relatively difficult to learn (but ok if you are good at languages) when it comes to writing. Some of it is very straightforward - other things such as prepositions can be a nightmare because there are sometimes no specific rules other than just learning them. The grammar can be tricky at times too. However, it is a difficult language to learn if you intend to speak it fluently - especially for people from the UK and the States. People from Holland, for some reason, become fluent in Swedish very quickly - closely followed by people from Germany.   When I moved to Sweden from Scotland in 2002 there were people in my Swedish class from all over the world. The courses were conducted purely in Swedish with no other languages spoken in class from day 1 (not even to ask questions). It was difficult to start with but the immersion method is certainly effective. A few in my class were sitting the class for the 2nd or 3rd time and all of them were from English speaking countries. The course tutors said that the people who struggle the most are those from english speaking countries (partly because they expect everyone they meet to understand english) and people from some war-torn parts of the world (some of whom have not even learnt to read and write their own native languages).    I was a church minister in Scotland for many years before I moved to Sweden (I am married to a Swede). I was offered a job as a minister in a swedish church on the understanding that I learn Swedish as soon as possible. For the first two years I just got by really. It is only the past year or two that I consider myself to be fluent in Swedish although I can still make mistakes with prepositions.    One swedish course that I would recommend is Learn Swedish Now  http://www.amazon.com/Transparent-Langua...  This is also available on amazon uk. It enables you to click on sentences and paragraphs and listen to native swedes speaking. You can also speak swedish into your computer microphone and the arrow swings on the guage to show if your pronunctiation is good, bad, fair, excellent. This was a life-saver for me and meant my congregation in my church could understand me better.  Actually, I have discovered that my scottish accent helps me a lot because it's easier for me to pronounce some of the strong "rrrr" sounds in Swedish.|`|X7kKS3Iraa	This is a great question,  a british friend learned swedish a while ago and for him it came easily although the pronunciation wasn't all that great since swedish is quiet different then english. As long as you have the motivation to do it then why not. He learned it by visiting sweden on a regular basis, and by using them language dvds, although i cannot recommend them since they're ****. As long as you have the means and the resources to learn it then id say a few months tops.|`|fVTNgewKaa	If your speak English, Swedish is a relatively easy language to learn because of cognates and similar grammar. Go for it!|`|G7hQIq3raa	I already know english and german so I find swedish super easy. I've been learning it for a few months now.
EzrdyxAiaa	you will damage the valves if you do so i would not recommend it!!!
56dfvnwmaa	youre right. it is hard for some women to be voluptuous but it is also ridiculous for some girls to be so skinny    however us guys are even worse at setting unrealistic standards for beauty for women. many of us males(me being an exception) claim that we prefer a girl who doesnt wear make up.    but look at this  http://hitsusa.com/blog/538/celebrities-...  these are among some of the most gorgeous women and even they need make up. to find a girl whos just as gorgeous as these ladies without any make up must be extremely rare    what I will say though regarding body types is that at least with the hourglass figure it requires food and exercise. most "models" only need to starve themselves to look like skin and bones. so unrealistic "voluptuous" figures vs unrealistic "anorexic" figures. I'll take voluptuous over anorexic. cause at least the few women who do have the hourglass figure actually eat and exercise    EDIT: for the race part. it surprisingly does have something to do with it. I've noticed that for white women(no offense just pointing something out) it's harder for them to achieve the voluptuous look. for them to have the hourglass figure they would have to have wider hips than the average white woman and work extra extra hard on the sides(or obliques) to really have that hourglass thing going on.     with black women, some middle eastern women and some latinas they generally tend to have some wider hips. and I think I may even have seen some asian women with wide hips. but in america and europe the standard for beauty is to be anorexic and since a lot of white women try to fit that standard I guess over time their bodies got used to having less curves and less hips.     but its also a matter of bone structure. you can get boobs and a butt but you cant get hips to achieve the hourglass look|`|CN7klGgbaa	Like Hitler, the media and the powers that be think that people should look the way they tell them to look. (Blonde hair Blue eyes) As if the media thinks they are god and they control the way a human being should appear. My heart beats and my blood vessels pulse, but not because the media said so. And i do not think they have the right to tell me how i should look when they do not give a damn about me or my life in the first place..And i never give my money to these fashion labels that think black women are ugly and will not send black models down their runways (such as marc jacobs) My mindset is, if your company is insulting me and my body, your company is not getting my money or my business.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	That's true, but what can we do? I am not going to starve myself for Lima's body or get implants for Monroe's wither. I am me and I know I was maid this way for a reason.|`|VsamHLPOaa	Well its all about who controls the media and what they think is beautiful, not what the average women looks like.|`|ggTx6IR8aa	True. Back in the day(like in the 1600's) the perception of beauty for women was pretty much overweight, pale, and not very tall. Now they  the perception of female beauty is thin, tan, and tall.     I'd rather have no ideal standards. Everyone is beautiful in some way.|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, you're correct in that most women don't have an hourglass figure. But, back then, women were allowed to be wider around, which is more natural. I'm hoping we start moving away from the hourglass and the stick figure, and move into a healthier range that will make more women feel beautiful/sexy/etc.

Make sure your candle has plenty of space & a sturdy surface.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Wicca is about far more than casting spells. It's a religion, a relationship with the natural world and the God and Goddess. Spells are only a small part of Wicca.    If you want to know more, I would suggest Wicca for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham. It's a great book, and it'll give you a thorough grounding in Wicca. Stay away from anything by Silver Ravenwolf; she's the epitome of fake "fluffy bunny" Wicca. You don't want to be a "fluffy bunny."|`|zAkeKg5Qaa	There are plenty of books that might interest you:    Solitary Wicca For Life  Wicca for Beginners: Fundamentals of Philosophy & Practice   Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner     I think those might get you on your way. These books are geared to the Wiccan that practicing privately and alone. You might have some disagreements here and there but life is about the journey. All the steps are not easy or agreeable.     I would recommend that as you learn, discuss your feelings and beliefs with other Wiccans. You might learn and make new friends.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I recommend Scott Cunningham's "Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner".  It's a very good book that outlines Wiccan beliefs, as well as how to do spells and gives you some good ones to try.  When searching for books you might find stuff by Silver RavenWolf. I haven't read much of her stuff, but I was warned that her books aren't so good if you're just starting out.  As to whether spells work, it really depends on how you approach them. If you're expecting spells to be a fix-it for all your problems then think again. Spells are more a way of appealing to deities and the universe for their support - you still have to take action yourself.  e.g. If you cast a spell to find your perfect job, but then don't apply anywhere, the spell will not come true. If you cast it and then work hard to put your resume in to all the places you would like to get a job and actively take steps to appear like a desirable employee, then the spell will work. Life has to be a combination of magic and non-magic actions.  Other books I have found useful are ones by Fiona Horne - her Handbook for Teen Witches was one of the first books about Wicca that I read, and it's a good starting point for knowledge.  I suggest that you start off by reading and learning as much as you can.  Good luck, and blessed be.  ??    Edit: Looks like people agree with me about Scott Cunningham but we have mixed opinions about Silver RavenWolf - it's really up to you which books you read, so my final advice would be to read anything and everything you can get your hands on. You can never have too much knowledge!    Edit Again: After reading some more answers, I have to say that I completely agree with everyone who has made a point of saying that Wicca is a religion and you shouldn't be in it just because you'll get to do spells. It is a belief system first and foremost.  Also, I disagree with the suggestion that you learn the left-hand spells as well - I feel that you disagree as well because you have said that you want to be a "good witch". The truth is, there is no such thing as a good witch or a bad witch. I'm not going to say that you mustn't do left-hand spells, because it's not my place to preach, but I would like to stress that the Golden Rule of Wicca is to adhere to the Wiccan Rede - An it harm none, do what ye will (or a variation). One Wiccan belief is that life is a balance and a duality - you have to acknowledge and accept the "evil" parts of the world as well as the good, but that doesn't mean that you should be casting left-hand spells, because that would be against the Wiccan Rede.  Oh, and one last thing:  Ever mind the Rule of Three,  Three times what thou givest returns to thee.  This lesson well, thou must learn,  The only gets what thou dost earn!  It's the threefold law - not all Wiccans believe in it/agree with it. Personally I do. Here's a great website that discusses karma and whatnot from a Wiccan perspective: http://www.geocities.com/k_garber/lawgoa...  ??|`|dFBccLExaa	Solitary witch means that you don't work within a coven. Most witches are solitary, as it takes time to find a coven, get accepted into it, and to practice within it.   There are hundreds of books (and websites) that you could use. I'd tell you to go to your local Barnes & Noble and look through the new age section. A good overal book is "Buckland's Guide to Witchcraft" By Raymond Buckland. Has a lot of stuff in it. Great for beginners.   Yes, spells out of books usually work, as do some of the ones off of websites. But really, your best bet is to learn about witchcraft and magick, and then write your own.|`|AA10852244	I will suggest you get the following....            Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|`|Asyn8sLkaa	From my experience with paganism and witchcraft, it's not anything about what you say, what you use, or when you do it. It's about intent and being clear about what you want to happen, unless you are talking about strict ceremonial magic. If the book you are using is by Silver Ravenwolf, I hear she is a good introductory writer but lacks the depth and consistency that writers such as Christopher Penzcak or even Cunningham offer. I'd suggest you peruse a few pagan podcasts to get a clearer view of what modern witches do and think on the topic.|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	Start with Scott Cunningham's "Earth Power".  Yes, the spells work.|`|W9C7m130aa	Yea, if your into the religion for spell casting, then your in it for the wrong reasons.     Theres way more to Wicca then casting spells.   But I do reccommend Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner|`|758f1c16f8aa9b1d1195f3f7d3415ca4aa	Start with Scott Cunningham's book "Earth Power" then go to his sequel to that. After that, read up and learn.     Oh and I do suggest you learn the left hand spells, not just right hand ones (left hand = "evil", right hand = "good"), that way you can be well prepared to deal with both aspects of our lives. I would suggest that you wait to learn the left hand stuff later in your studies...
oVKPxClQaa	"people that don't believe in god don't answer"  silly    2 things wrong with this:    1) Why are you letting someone else tell you what is, and is not real?  Shouldn't you make that thought for yourself?   What if your teacher told you that if you were to breath underwater, you wouldn't drown, would you go try it?    2) Closing off a school of thought just because it doesn't mesh well with what you want to think, is completely ridiculous.  The best term I have heard for such ways of thinking is "Willful Ignorance."  Don't get caught in that trap.|`|cFrtOg45aa	Your teacher should be reported to the Catholic diocese.

Revelation 21:1  Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.  2  Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.      3  And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.  4  And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away."      5  Then He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And He said to me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."  6  And He said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts.  7  He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.    ...10  And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,  11  having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.  12  Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:  13  three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.  14  Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.      15  And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.  16  The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.  17  Then he measured its wall: one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.  18  The construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.      19  The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,  20  the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.  21  The twelve gates were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.      22  But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.  23  The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.  24  And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.  25  Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there).  26  And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.  27  But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.|`|Johiu2cwaa	Listen to your teacher.

There is a heaven because we have to go somewhere.|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	First of all don't stick to religion stick to God. Learn God's word and seek knowledge. There is a heaven because there is a God. Heaven is God's kingdom/dimension or realm. If you know God exists so does God. God is real. Some cathlics and Christians are corrupted.

We do not know if heaven is a physical place, another universe, a state of mind, or something we cannot even imagine. Trust God and it will be better than anything we can imagine.

Santa, Easter Bunny, Harry Potter, Superman, Thor, Zeus, etc..and your idea of god along with all other gods,  Stay in school.|`|50azgKE8aa	Ok first of all heaven is a place that the Lord has created for his children( born again belivers).  The Bible says that all who accept the Lord as their savior will be in heaven with him, but if we don't accept his gift of salvation he has give  to us by sending his son to earth to die on the cross for our sins then we can't go to heaven we will go to hell.  Which as well as heaven is a real place.  I encourage you to read John 3:16 and Revelation in the Bible or go to biblegateway.com and type salvation in the search bar.  A bunch of verses will pop up that you can  read.  How you can get to heaven is by praying to the Lord and asking for forgivness, admitting you are a sinner and putting your 100% total faith in him.  The Lord is amazing and will use you for his will if you let him.  I encourage you to start reading your bible everyday and learning more about the Lord.  The more you learn about the Lord and live like the Lord tells us to in the Bible the closer you'llget to Him.  And think about it... God made us to bring glory to Him but if we don't run to Him and flee from sin then how can we glorify him?  Try reading psalms and proverbs as well!!! I wish you all the best and I'll be praying for you! Hope I answered your question!!!!!|`|NqxYL9aKaa	I to am a Catholic and your teacher is right heaven is a thought, and Christs thought about heaven was a paradise and that is all he shared about it and never went into details, so no one really knows what heaven or hell is like so really heaven is simply what you perceive it to be, and that can only come from thought so do not hate your teacher trust in God and stick to what you believe and share it with no one because a relationship with God is vary personal and he really likes it to be kept that way so pray in private and in your closet like Christ has told us to do stay pure in heart and blessings will be abundant for you. May God Bless.

H1DrMEZxaa	Does it matter?  People will call you a lesbian, but it comes down to what YOU want to call yourself.  If you don't think you are, then you're not.  Love is love, and love is beautiful.  Everyone should just remember that and forget about these stupid words that people have made up like gay and straight, male and female, black and white.  That's all they really are:  words.|`|UYFumRVVaa	bi? been there. dont that. no fun =[|`|vHFx2iy6aa	It does if you want to move on sexually with her|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Nope.  Lesbianism implies being potentially attracted to all women, based on the fact that they're women.    If you like her because of her, the best words to describe you would simply be "I'm straight, but love is gender-blind".|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Your only a lesbian is the thought of sleeping with or having a relationship with a guy does nothing for you ever  Sounds like your bicurious as it is possible to love someone based on who they are not what gender they are|`|MuALb7lxaa	No. You are just accepting people.

If you like a girl you like a girl, regardless to personality. If you tend to only like girls, then yes you're a lesbian, but you don't sound like the type to judge on gender obviously|`|UHfjV57raa	Pansexual, maybe?|`|Uxs2wy7Haa	no not really, only u can decide that. but labels are dumb and unnecessary. when people ask me if im gay or straight i just say that im sexually fluid :D|`|JY0Ix1rPaa	who cares if you like her you like her  its simple really ..... why do you have to mess it up with labels ?|`|WRSNIusaaa	It depends. If you like guys as well then you could be bisexual, which would explain why you feel that you like people for who they are, rather than their gender.  Nobody, gay or straight, likes anybody just because of their gender. I'm a lesbian but i love my girlfriend for who she is, not because she's a girl, but the fact that i like a girl is because i'm gay. If we liked people for there gender then we would like everybody of that gender. It's our sexualities which determine which gender/s we will be attracted to.  A lot of the time (i've noticed), bisexuals seem to believe that they like people based on their "souls" rather than their anatomy. Which i don't believe is true. I think that bisexuals just aren't aware of how important gender is when determining who you're attracted to because they belong in the middle of both extremes (gay and straight). But it's still a sexuality which governs who we are able to be attracted to.  What i'm trying to say is that if you like a girl, and you are a girl,  then it's part of your sexuality, not just because she happens to be a wonderful person. If you have the ability to be attracted to another girl then you're either lesbian or a have a degree of bisexuality.
6tYQEwxGaa	Yes. Unlike heaven, hell, purgatory, nirvana, etc. etc., the place where you were before you were born is known to exist.     While there is no evidence to suggest that even a single person has been to heaven, billions and billions of people have been to the place where you were before you were born.

One of the main reasons for the blood shortages is due to the strict donor requirements.     So in a way, the AABB (American Society of Blood Banks) as well as the FDA (who regulates the policies used for blood banks, since blood is technically classified as a "therapeutic drug") kind of shoot themselves in the foot on this.  There's a strict need to be overly cautious about the purity of blood donations, which is why there's such an extensive list of donor questionnaire screening and such, but that also reduces the amount of eligible donors as well, unfortunately.      People SHOULD donate blood if they are eligible to do so.  One unit of blood can save two lives.  Also, not just packed RBC's (red blood cells) are used.  Often in blood transfusions, it's not the whole blood product that's used.  Often in a blood donation, that unit of blood is separated into platelets, FFP (fresh, frozen plasma), cryoprecipitate (coagulation factors), as well as packed red cells.     These different blood components are used for numerous things...to treat anemia, to replace blood loss, to treat people with clotting disorders like hemophiliacs, to create reagents for antibody testing to detect blood crossmatch incompatibility testing, and so forth.     There's been blood shortages for a very long time due to the need for blood.  There's always been a greater need than there is product available.      People with type O positive  blood are especially encouraged to donate since they are universal donors to anyone with a positive Rh blood group.      People with type AB are universal recipients.  They can receive blood from people with type A, type B, type AB, or type O. Of course the Rh factor (what makes you negative or positive) still has to match.     The only known time there has NOT been a blood shortage was following 9/11.  And that was due to sooo many people offering to donate blood that there was no way to store it all.     Platelets have to be stored at room temp and can only be held for 5 days.  RBC's are only good for 32 days, and FFP can be frozen for up to one year.  This is also a reason why there are blood shortages.  It expires faster than we can collect it.    *EDIT* to all the people complaining about gays being denied as blood donors:        This policy was set not by the blood banks themselves, but by the FDA.  They are over all the blood banks in the U.S. since they determine blood products to be a "therapeutic drug".  The FDA has VERY strict policies on their acceptance standards for drug therapy.  Also, it's been studied that gay men are at a much higher risk of not only HIV/AIDS, but also black gay men, black bisexual men, and black women who have sex with bi black men. Mostly because these black men tend to be on the "down low" about their sexual orientation, leading to a higher rate of the spread of certain diseases.        If there is only 10% of the population at risk for hepatitis, or even less for mad cow disease,  yet they are deferred from donating due to the POSSIBILITY of spreading hepatitis, or mad cow,  why would it be fair to let gay men who have a 50% or higher risk group for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases be eligible donors?  If you think about it THAT way, it tends to make sense.       Also, yes..blood is tested.  However, it's NOT tested for EVERYTHING.  It's tested for HIV, hepatitis, west nile virus, and syphillis.  And these tests are based on EIA's, or enzyme immunoassays.  They rely on a antigen/antibody reaction to produce a colored enzymatic result.  If the person is infected but still in a nondetectable "window" period, due to not producing enough antibodies to be detectable on an EIA test, the person can be positive and spread their disease without it being picked up by laboratory testing.  These is why, just because of the RISK percentage, these people are deferred.|`|x7uRjwseaa	Why should I care? They don't want my blood any ways.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=bloo...|`|VeXDGn62aa	I don't get why the FDA whines that they need blood yet they deny homosexual's blood, saying that homosexuals have a higher chance of having HIV/AIDS when that's not only a false statement but a ridiculous one. They test the blood for diseases regardless.    edit: Ok, the FDA is in charge? I'll edit that part of my answer. Dr. Cox, the fact remains that the blood is still tested and there is no reason to deny blood if there is truly such a shortage out there. Yes, the tests might fail, but if you're still going to deny blood as blood banks do, don't go around crying about a blood shortage. I have no sympathy for them.

Like America, it's a ''new world'' (post-Columbian) country, so you'll see people of European and African descent there. And to a lesser degree, some indigenous (Taino) roots. There's many full whites (mostly Spaniard, but other European backgrounds such as Corsican, French, German). There's also full black's too. White's are the majority of the island. Some have Taino in them, but it's usually a small percentage. White's make up around 70-75 percent of Puerto Rico. Black's make up from 8 to 10 percent. Mulatto's (mixed of white/black) make up around 1/4 of the island.    So without telling us what your ancestry is within your Puerto Rican ancestry, how are we supposed to tell you what your race is on your mother's side? All we know to this point is that your mother is of French background, which would seemingly guaranteeably make you at least 50% ''white'' at minimum. Who knows? Maybe you got French lineage within your dad's Puerto Rican side. Remember. Saying you're Puerto Rican is like saying you're American or Canadian. Most people in Puerto Rico would not be existing for today had it not been for colonialism, immigration and slavery. Similarly, American's can say the same thing.    What you should do is ask your mother what her ethnic ancestry is within her Puerto Rican ancestry. It shouldn't be that hard. You could probably tell by looking, but asking questions always can provide new information. If she doesn't know, ask your grandparents, or if they're alive, your great-grandparents. Remember though. Race is a ''social construct.'' That means it's something people make believe. It's really something American's put too much importance on.    Also, in response to a poster above, I don't know where you heard that Soledad O'Brien considers herself ''black.'' If that's actually what she said, I think her viewers may see her a little differently. Forget the fact she grew up upper-middle class in Long Island to a father with an Australian accent and a mother with a Cuban accent. Her father is an Australian citizen of mostly Irish and some Italian ancestry. Her mother's an Afro-Cuban. She doesn't hold the kinship ties to African-American's, so she is not apart of the ''black'' identity. Also, she doesn't really physically come off very black. She looks white. It's possible her mother was part white and if you mix that with her full white father, it'd make her more lineally European, which may be why she looks more white.|`|5HdTUIBeaa	The US system of racial classification has always been, uh, bad, period.  The quick answer nowadays is to pick the race you identify with the most, and look the most like.   But it hasn't always been this way.    (Now for the fun part)    The US racial classifications have historically been based on how "white" you are or are not.  Depending on what part of the country you lived in, the "locals" wanted to make sure you weren't asian, mexican, or black "pretending" to be white.  Especially after the Civil War, much of the focus has been to distinguish "black" from "white,"  and is reflected on many of the questionnaires that have appeared since then.  For example, on most "what race are you" questions, you will have at very least black, white or other.      Like many of the other answers, with no other information, it sounds like you'd be closest to white.  However, this will only work if your features are very fair (very light beige to light tan [think Italian]).  If you are darker than that (no other info) you probably should try "other" unless you want a lot of questions you will tire of answering.    Historically, the rule for checking black is if you have any known African person in your ancestral line (up to great grand person in some states, great great grand parents in others), you were considered "black/African."  This is the origin of  what is called "the one drop rule:" If you're "one drop" African, you're black, end of story.  If your mother is Puerto Rican, there is a very good chance of that.  It was and still is a very bad system for a lot of reasons, but unfortunately some people still think like that.  Welcome to human history (just about every culture has some form of this).     The newer race questionnaires usually include hispanic (and asian), some times just hispanic, some times with variations (white hispanic or black hispanic).  If you speak spanish as your first language or it was spoken at home, your parents/grandparents/great grandparents speak spanish, or your ancestors come from a traditionally spanish speaking country (even Spain and Puerto Rico), this is probably your "catagory." With the variations, it's back to the US system: if you have known African ancestry, black hispanic; no known Africans and fair features, white hispanic.    Like I said at the beginning, look at the list, and pick which one you identify with the most.  If your features don't look like what you've picked, expect a lot of questions.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	what ever box you check on the census form|`|GSuhBn8uaa	white,It also depends on your features|`|AA11993638	Human

If these groups were prevented from organizing and discussing, they'd do it illegally. And it'd make it more enticing.The truth is, little action actually occurs with either organization. Being apart of either organization is like an automatic black ball or trash label in the real world.    Membership rates for both groups are relatively low too. The only people who join these organization are losers with too much time on their hands. They should be worrying more about how to not lose their marriages or jobs. The Black Panthers and KKK got more in common with each other than the average American citizen has with another. The reason why is they believe, or at least are subjecting themselves to hear a message of hatred. Most wind up feeling terrible about it before they die. These people let the system overwhelm them.    To even call them a ''supremacist'' is a job, because they're among the least ''supreme'' of their own racial background, when speaking financially and educationally. Similarly, black panther's are losers and are polarized from the average African-American.    The fact that you think this is okay shows that you believe too much of what you hear. Or you believe in the message the media sends.    Stridency sells, so the media will show what sells. It sells more to show white shame, so that's why the KKK would be more heard of than the Black Panther's.    This kind of argument would be similar to that of someone saying why is it okay for a black person to say the n word, but not a white person?    The answer would be it's right for neither, but the truth is, it's only a word, and by providing importance to a word, you provide life. The fact that the descendants of those most discriminated against are the most using it though is beyond one of the most disgraceful elements among not just African-American culture, but American culture, and it's letting Jim Crow smile in his grave.    People should use their minds and realize hatred is wrong and that race is not biological, but just something people make up. Sadly, there's American ignorant enough to believe that poor black's speak differently than white's because that's just how they naturally are. It couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth, because if it were, than black's in other country's would speak differently than white's. Spend an hour in London and you'd know British people, white or black, speak alike.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Black panthers dont lynch white folk.   enough said|`|joa30mM8aa	Black Panthers arent PC either....I dont like WS, but I get tired of the double standard|`|MtweOtuLaa	They can do what they want, as long as they're not inciting violence on others.

You also did a very, very good job.    When you write the article "la" in front of hamburguesa, or ensalada, or pizza, you are writing "the."  The sentence is COMPLETELY correct, but I don't think you would say, "I eat the hamburger..."  I think you would say "I eat a hamburger, " or "I eat hamburgers."     If I'm right, then you would say...    yo como una hamburguesa, o una ensalada de frutas, o una pizza.  OR  yo como hamburguesas, ensalada de frutaas, o pizza.    The same is true for the drinks...  yo bebo agua o un refresco...  (I drink water or A soft drink...)    The verb encantar does not agree with the subject pronoun (I, you, we, etc.).  It agrees with the thing that you like, so it can only be "encanta," if there is one item; or "encantan," if there are more than one.  So for papas fritas, we say "Me encantan las papas fritas."  Also, for I love lunch, we say "Me encantA el almuerzo.    I want to contradict what someone else said here.  AGUA is a feminine noun (agua fra, agua pura), but it's article is always "el."  There is a reason for this - the first syllable in agua is stressed (A- gua), and you can never have the article "la" in front of a word that begins with the letter "a" in a syllable that is stressed.    el agua        Again, I am impressed with your efforts.  You must be a great student.

When I tour Europe I noticed ugly Americans as well and when I watched that Dateline show it was the Americans that actually said something to the ugly Americans about embarrassing them and how things should actually be done.    While his question is borderline with if it is a TOS violation, there is an answer.  Antarctica.   So it could be seen as seeking an answer.  Just posting a youtube video isn't really a question seeking knowledge.    Personally, I love America always.  I mean yes some Americans are horrible @ssholes.  Well, many French and Russias are too.  One German started a World War.  The English can't cook.  Nigeria condones their Nigerian scams.  Many Kenyans are ignorant.  Lots of Chinese are racist.  None of that makes me dislike the country itself.  I love America for all the good, and never change my mind based on one person.

WseLyvSpaa	Intuition is a lazy word for all sorts of perceptions, usually involving personal relationships.  The fact is, we can pick up very subtle cues from people by their behavior, and quickly get the impression that "there is a bad vibe" or "somethign good will happen" .  There is nothing psychic about this.  It simply involves processing a lot of very subtle sensory information:  things like the way people look at us, the way the interact with other people when they see us, the way they speak to each other and to us...We are mostly very sensitive to this type of information because social interaction is an extremely important aspect of human life. On the other hand, there are others who are socially more inept, even to the extent of autism, who are not receptive to these kinds of social cues. There is a healthy balance.    The fact that you only notice bad vibes means you may be suspicious and a bit neurotic. And/or you may find yourself in dodgy environments a lot.  Try to enjoy safe environments, with friends, and don't be too sensitive!|`|vH2OF9z8aa	you are Opening oneself to intuition and enhanced awareness.

It can also mean consistent, stable, discoverable, and exhibiting affordances. And some other things. The reason it means different things is that intuitive is not a concrete or objective       D?mon~~?|`|16vMIGPiaa	Psychic, no.  Being psychic means you can "see around corners" so to speak.    Really intuitive means you can draw conclusions from sparse information or a large collection of apparently unrelated data.    It can be a big asset in problem solving, but learn to be cautious about how you use it.  You'll arrive at wrong answers often.|`|9vTWgiGgaa	Being intuitive is being able to sense energies from other people aand being abl to pick up on clues. You're right. I'm also that way too but I'm trying to elude the truth that I know about my intuition and it grows faster than the human being. It's like an extra kick of wisdom.
NwYwLdsNaa	Mayan  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation, search  The adjective Mayan is sometimes used to refer to the indigenous peoples of parts of Mexico and Central America, their culture, language, and history. More formally, the use of "Mayan" is restricted to referring to an aspect of their languages; "Maya" is the adjectival form preferred when referring to non-linguistic aspects.    Mayan may also refer to:    Maya civilization - dealing with the historical pre-Columbian Maya civilization, culture, history and archaeology   Maya peoples - collective designation for the various indigenous peoples of the region, sharing cultural and linguistic heritage   Mayan languages - a language family of related languages traditionally spoken by the Maya peoples   Yucatec Maya language - a specific Mayan language, often referred to simply as 'Mayan' (or Maya)   Maya script - the writing system in use by the pre-Columbian Maya civilization|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	mayan just refers to the people. the Mayan people. not sure but i think the area they used to occupy is what is now the Riviera Maya.

NmGf6B1Caa	"Racist" might not be the word for it but there is definitely discrimination here.  Now, when you add the penis thing, it's sounding pretty ridiculous lol I mean... come on.  If you're serious, you should ask yourself if it's really that he's black or that some guy's penis is floating near your 16 yr old daughter.  If the guy were white, would it be better?  If you say yes, then you definitely have a problem.      It's also about how you were raised.  I suppose if your parents instilled upon you this type of mentality, then you're destined to share it, but honestly, it's 2009.  Come on!  As long as he treats her with respect and loves her, what does his ethnicity matter?  And for GOD'S SAKE just because he's black doesn't mean his wee wee is gargantuan!  Ugh.... sounds like your stereotyping mentality needs to just let it go.     I'd be more concerned about ANY penis near my 16 year old daughter rather than what shade the penis is.  If you can't just accept that he's a person just like she is, then you should talk to a professional about your rage issues.  Just remember, a jerk is a jerk and not just one ethnic background has the majority control over being an *** towards people.  So be thankful if she has a decent person who loves her and not an a-hole who beats her (and again, that can be anyone of any ethnicity.)    I hope this helps and if you're just being a prejudice troll, thanks for the points.|`|a7IAkpJtaa	yes, obviously you are|`|2ZZt1etIaa	You are racist, but it isn't your fault. From what you've described, you seem like you are someone fighting the racism you grew up with and have succeed in many ways so far.    My advice to you would be, to treat him the same you would any other guy your young daughter wishes to date. ( Watch them together, get to know his personality and how he treats her, then if he is acceptable in THAT manner, allow them to continue to date.)    If you are honestly concerned about a penis near your daughter, you may want to convince a motherly figure to talk to her about contraceptives.|`|B66y8c9caa	Yes u r    U jus mad his iz bigger than urs|`|fdMKpXCHaa	By the way you've described the situation you're a racist.  You're saying that blacks are ok to have as friends, but not as potential in-laws.  The fact that you believe the stereotype that he has a large penis doesn't help either.  It would be normal for you not to want ANY penis near your daughter, but that's not what you've suggested.  Good luck.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	That's not right, you just have to accept your dathger dating a black guy|`|AA10067344	Yes, you're racist.  A lot of people are.  For the most part it's okay as long as you don't do anything silly like forbid them from dating.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Well first of all yes that is racist and that is also a really stupid stereotype. Not all black guys are large in that regard. They are just like anyone else.|`|VpTxqL2Aaa	You arent racist really but just overprotective. Its what your daughter wants that matters and you will need to try and get passed this prejudice.        Perhaps you are intimidated by his "large black penis" because you are uncomfortable with your sexuality or you are jealous. Men in general are way too competitive about their manhood mainly because they are uncomfortable with some guy having one bigger..... News flash.... their is always one bigger.|`|77f2295c3cf2cea79caaed785ef71e9eaa	Be honest with yourself the only reason it bothers you is that e is BLACK|`|8I4QY6osaa	ONCE YOU GO BLACK, YOU CAN NEVER GO BACK!!      edit-  No, I don't think you're racist.

All this does is make you a prejudiced troll.|`|7q78bhAaaa	you are definitely very intolerant. If the guy is a good person then let love be love. If he is taking advantage of your daughter, then you have the right to feel afraid but not to the point where you don't want her with another race. Hope you get over being racist peace!|`|kHYHFwkYaa	umm yes this would make you racist..   get to know who he is not what he is, & trust your daughter..|`|cd750eea4217ae61281dfe63b451de8eaa	Yep.  Yep you are.  The thought of any man's 'penis anywhere near' your daughter should bother you if she is 16.  When the color of that particular organ is the source of your rage, then yep, you are a racist.

Sounds like even though she has THE degree, she is still very lacking in self-confidence.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	Sounds like she's a bit of an attention whore.    My personal opinion, based on the info you gave, is that she expected you to do back-flips for her and praise her godliness- which also means no matter how sincere you are with it will never truly matter unless you lose your dignity to express it, because her focus is herself, and what everybody can do for her.

Don't let her argue; if she starts to refute your sincerity, just look her in the eye, turn and walk away--let her deal with whether she wants to believe you or not.  She is obviously a very very insecure girl who is going to continue to be very insecure since she feels she has to point out her Ph.D. (which doesn't mean a whole lot to most of the world except you've spent an awful lot of time in school rather than working for a living).

BuOHv2XKaa	I have a dream that man will be judged by who he hates rather then who he loves.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Show the hypocrisy of homophobia.  Nobody wants to be a hypocrite.    Edit:  Also, and this is a message to Jase also, show the hypocrisy of using religion to hate gays.  Try not to insult religion, but say that since being gay is not a choice, God makes people gay.  So if God sends gays to hell, then he is damning us even though he made us this way, therefore he is not all-knowing, crumbling the very foundation religion rests upon.|`|syIp6d2Naa	The one thing I always fall back on when trying to explain that this is not a choice.  Can you really make yourself believe that we wake up one morning and just say I think I'll be gay, lesbian, asexual, transgendered, or bi sexual? That we would willingly put ourselves in the situation to be held in contempt, disgust, have people prejudice and deal with homophobes. Be ridiculed and damned by many religious people. Does anyone think we want to be abused verbally, and in many times physical violence even to death. Would you think any of us would want to be denied rights to housing, work, medical treatment. It happens all the time. Do you really feel we should not have the right to be with the person we love should they be hospitalized and in intensive care where the rules are immediate family and spouse only. For those of us who are parents, say you have been with your partner ten years and you have a child, the two of you are all the child knows as parents, and you die. Your child can be removed from their home and away from the only other parent they have ever known. This puts the child into the foster care system, your rights to even see the child is taken away. If a relative takes the child they can prevent you from seeing the child also. It this case you have lost not just one but the two (or more if there are more children) people you love more than anything else in this world. Why would you begrudge us the right to carry the other on our insurance if we're paying for it, why can't we have the tax credits and other rights that straight couples have. As far as us being born this way I know I was, when I came out to my grandmother who raised me from 8 months to almost 10, she told me she knew already. Then told me of my fasination with women even as a toddler, she continued to raise me as any child would be learning that a girl grows up and gets married and has a family. She said she knew it had not made any difference over the years I was growing up as she could see the difference in my reactions to males and females. By the time I wnet to live with my father and his new family I knew something was very wrong. I didn't think like the other girls in school. When I rebelled from my fathers drunken beatings and emotional abuse I turned to a female for comfort. We became a couple and when she was killed in an accident I was subjected to treatment by a shrink, I do not honor him with the title of Psychiatrist as he did not treat me as a person suffering from grief but as an abnormal person whom he must make straight. These things still go on now, Yes we can cure you, and they proceed to brainwashing you into believing  there is something wrong with you. Slowly though they are figuring out we're not in need of a cure for being abnormal but of an understanding and being helped to handle the stress placed on us from so many different directions. You also hear how promiscuous we are suppose to be, well I can help debunk that too. I have been with my partner 29 1/2 years this month. Neither has ever cheated, we have good relationships with family and friends and are very happy.   I hope this will give you a lot to go on so you can make the speach and maybe teach a few people out there some tolerence, and thank you for coming to us for the information you can use.|`|7q78bhAaaa	watch Milk for inspiration.  edit:  research some Anita Bryant and it will piss you off so bad, words will come to you|`|Nd3qRjtuaa	A gay or bisexual person needs great strength to rub across the grain of society and has the ability to love another person for the person they are inside, not the person our eyes initially see.|`|3CBxuMrFaa	Well, i've never been much good at talking, but i've had my share of homophobes.

Allah and HIS Allmighty's Angels doing the same for us 33:43    This verse is one of the most distorted and abused verses. We translated the word salli ala as "support/encourage." The same word occurs at,4:65 33:43 and 9:99,133. When these verses are studied comparatively, the traditional abuse and distortion becomes evident. Through this distortion, Muslim masses are led to commemorate and praise Muhammad's name day and night, rather than his Lord's and Master's name (33:41-42). Also, see 2:157.     such a powerful command of Allah Allmighty,to send durud n salam to Prophet ,but strange Allah Allmighty didnt tell us in Glorious Quran the words of Durud o salam !!! and we find it in book of bukhary !    33:43 He is the One who supports you, along with His angels, to lead you out of darkness into the light.

Blond hair and blue eyes are recessive so if more blond haired blue eyed people marry people with brown hair/black hair and brown eyes then yes after a while blond hair and blue eyes will die out.    But even though it is a recessive gene it can pop up somewhere down the line unexpectedly so I guess it can never completely die out. There will always be a blond haired blue eyed person just it will become more and more rare until it's almost non-existent.|`|3IVqoH16aa	If everything keeps going the way it is and blonde hair and blue eyes are recessive genes then probably.  If something significant happens, like radical climate change or some killer disease for example, then maybe not.  Genetic diversity is a strength of a species and not a weakness.  Hitler wanted to create a "master race" with everyone having blonde hair and blue eyes.  But this genetic similarity could mean his whole race could get wiped out by one disease or something like that.|`|TZeKta4haa	not unless allians come and kill everyone exept for one ma and one woman that are not blond or blue eyed.................mwahahahaha........... like that will ever happen!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VUfT35UQaa	Interesting question.    I heard somewhere that in 100 years there will be no ginger hair, a it was a mutation in genes a long time ago, which is a shame, because red hair is lovely, but i think we will all look better (mots beautiful people have more than one bloodline) Blonde hair is common in many countries, as are blue eyes, so in places like england, cultural melting pots, I think we will all look more mixed but, more exotic :D|`|BWttPY1taa	They won't die out over time, cos even they really die out, people can still dye their hair and wear coloured contact lenses.
kkO87h0Xaa	Are you talking about these sect arguments?    Shia and Sunni Muslims, etc..?    I agree with you on that, then.

MGEYaehVaa	How about a coloring book and an action figure?    Seriously?  You have your whole life ahead of you to be dating!  But, if you insist....    A home-made card and candy is perfect.  Seriously try the action figure, too.  He'll love it.|`|Ot2AERbcaa	im nto going to say your too young because girls are most of the time way mature for their age but dont spend a lot of money on him just like candy and a card or a shirt or something nothing to expensive there will be other guys trust me (:  good luck though
GdvzZRFMaa	My worst was a coffee pot I was given and I didn't drink coffee.    The best was a dinner show to see Elvis.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	The first birthday after I was married, back in 1975, my husband got me nothing. A card would have been nice or just a hug and "Happy birthday." I never did forget his birthday. Worst thing about it was, he knew it was my birthday. I think that is worse than forgetting, to remember but not acknowledge it like you don't matter. He did some better as years went by, but that really hurt. The best gift? My second husband threw a surprise dinner for me with some of my family attending. He's a sweetheart, thoughtful.|`|AA11650395	My worst was that I asked for jewlery or Olive Garden (possibly both)- that year I got studded snow tires for my car (I really couldn't complain because I needed the winter tires, but I was hoping it would've been something special). - That was an ex by the way as I'm sure you can see why.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	I have never received a disappointing gift. Any gift is always a treasure to me. My best gift was a full length mink coat that my husband gave to me about 15 years ago and I still wear it every Winter. It is the warmest coat you could ever find.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	The worst was a large cast iron skillet with a lid.  The best was a trip to LAS Vegas.  Different husbands as you can imagine.|`|0ede6ed5af86402f961daba9a691dc95aa	The most disappointing would have been the IOU for a trip out of state to go gambling, but we would stay with hubby's parents.  I never redeemed that IOU.  The best birthday gift was one where we spent the day together working in the yard and then * cleaning up together.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Best?  The automatic car starter was a real biggie.      Worst?  Maybe the bed comforter that was blue on one side and navy blue on the other.  Very masculine.  I'd rather have had white, or something with flowers.  Or something else...    Never cared for it when he bought me a new vacuum or frying pans.  Would much rather have flowers or candy, or something impractical.|`|8G42oyydaa	some absolutely beautiful raku pottery ! I couldnt have picked anything better myself, the one and only gift I got in 8 years, after that he said I was too hard to shop for and he had no idea what I would want.     Which meant he had made a gesture and was too damn cheap to ever buy another gift,  not for my birthday, mothers day, valentines day, anniversary or xmas.  Did I mention this is the EXE SO?|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Aside from not getting a gift at all when we were too hard pressed  for money, it had to be one year when he told me the coat he gave  me for my birthday was going to serve as both my birthday and  upcoming Christmas gift. That made for a bleaker Christmas. But  we've had plenty of them during our marriage.     The best Christmas gift, was a ticket to come up to see my family  when our only child was around 15 months. I spent most of the time  having morning sickness, not knowing I was PG again.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	A monkey pot from Laguna Beach Art Festival was the dang-est gift I ever got in the late 70's. A small shop outside of La Frenz' where we were staying.    It was both.    I learned how to make monkey bread and I still have the gift some 30 years later.    But when I got it I thought what will I do with this!    Still remember who gave it to me as well.

Doop6GpLaa	Someone who doesn't know you believe in psychics.|`|4NV4bew9aa	Go and read some books perhaps psychology texts.    Also do not give out your personal details online.    For one thing not all psychics are astrologers.     Also this birth date suggests you are college age and old enuff to know NOT to waste your time on psychics!|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Stop asking these things. Psychic's dont hang out on yahoo answers! Track one down for goodness sake.
WQjDQgB9aa	....who have you been shaking hands with??|`|RgymoiIQaa	Either way I don't shake hands. What if they have scabies or something else contagious. And like you said where have their hands been? They may have a cold and that is how colds are spread. And what if they just scratched their butt, or picked their nose, or shook someone else's hand and they were sick. EWW. I never shake hands.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	I can't even answer this question.|`|hpdZDBVQaa	I never had a wart.
dqnLZaIRaa	Don't try to memorize...just enjoy!  Let the experience soak in by enjoying every moment.  There's no reason for you to remember every detail...fond memories aren't made that way.  Enjoy your trip!|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	No.  I do look around just to enjoy a different scenery but I don't try to burn it all into my faulty memory.  I don't even take pictures because I don't take very good pictures and they usually cannot capture the depth and awesomeness--like a sunset always comes out as this little bright orange spot in the middle of this dull looking beach (or whatever)--so I generally buy a good picture book from one of the tourist stores of all the sights, maybe buy some slides too.  I don't want to start collecting things and having to put them in a scrapbook or store them somewhere when I get home.  I just let myselt enjoy and let the feelings go through me.  I do what makes me happy, not what my travelmates want me to do unless I really do want to do them.    And then if I feel like it, when I get home, I sit down and write a little essay, just for myself (maybe on a blog) about my trip, how I felt before leaving, the getting there (I hate planes), my hotel room, what I ate, what things I did, etc.  Just as my journal entry so years from now I can recall (since things change so quickly these days, when I go back a lot of these things won't exist anymore).    Just open your eyes and let things go in them.  Your brain will store what is significant.  Don't try to force it.  It's kind of like taking effective notes in class--you can write down every single thing that's said in class but most of it will just be a waste of paper, you learn to filter out the important stuff.  And what's important to one person on a trip may not be important to someone else.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I think you will have much better memories if you just live in the moment and take it easy on a trip.  You'll look back and remember those few things that really stood out and impressed you and aren't those memories better than silly things like how detailed the pattern of the wall paper in your room was?    You could always take a digital camera and just take a zillion pictures if you are really obsessive about this memory thing.  That way you can go back later and look at all those little things but not have to be spending time memorizing silly things.|`|ZjmjCpiWaa	I guess I'm not understanding.  What would you memorize on a vacation?|`|ghz5D5iLaa	No. Live in the moment and have some fun. You will remember.
6LBJgACSaa	ya the same thing happens to me. Like I can't eat during that time. I can only eat light things, smelling or even seeing anything that seems heavy in fat or anything that isn't light will make me feel sick. I can't stand certain foods such as chicken, fries, ....all the oils basically. And ya I get nauseous and sometimes because of that I end up throwing up. My cramps are TERRIBLE to the point that I literally can't do anything. I have to take an advil as soon as I feel the slightest pain otherwise I won't be able to control it, if I wait it out.|`|Eo7qRPJyaa	It's quite normal. In fact, I am on it. Ugh. I get heavy blood clots, too, and yeah, it is normal.    Sorry, it happened to you. Being a girl totally sucks.|`|efb24eedcf484b875157731a08fef57aaa	I get very emotional when I PMS, and if someone pisses me off, I blow up, and I tend to be a little on the "ughhh" side lol.      I have blood clots too :(  I think its because I'm becoming an old women lol  Also as a doctor, I advise you drink water, blood clots are normal.  99% blood clots are normal and the other 1% can be something bad. If you witness sharp pain with all that nausea you need to see a doctor.     Asalamu Alaykum|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	I puke, faint have no idea where I am. It's not normal but it is due to my weight (I need meat on me). Never had clots though, maybe theirs  blockage or something hence causes that, if it does happen regularly get your self checked out Insha'Allah.|`|WGUfF7reaa	I dont have my period nor have I ever pms'd  hehe I hope my luck lasts for a while longer:)|`|zWKqEa9vaa	it is not common but natural.eat well,drink plenty of fluids get yourself some vitamins and see a doc.there is no shame in that.  hope you feel better soon|`|aYi8oEkJaa	tell me about it  *sigh*  my entire system is changing!! .. i feel nauseous, extremely thristy, loss of appitite but yet i crave for something, extreme low or high in energy levels, mood swings ... blah blah ... on right now actually =(  blood clots are normal .. i know people that have those. you were going to black out?! whoa! i hope you are eating well , loads of iron rich foods, esp. while pmsing.  take care.|`|nyReGoBhaa	No.|`|Ca29B3eiaa	yes habibti that happens to me. I fainted twice because i hadn't eaten the night before. I wouldn't worry about it that much though, your body is losing blood so it's normal for your body to feel weak, just eat eat eat during that time.   Hope you feel better :)|`|IEaedB5Eaa	When im pm'sing, I have headache, dizzy, crave sweets, and very moody. Although I bleed heavily, I don't clot. You should keep seeing your doctor to see whts really happening down there. :-)|`|prUTCU8raa	Some people get nauseous when pms'ing. It's not very common but not unheard of either. As for clots, they are fairly common. It happens when your flow is very heavy.

The Miller-Urey hasnt been undone for almost 30 years now.  But i agree that is you atheist, you see fossils you want to construct a timeline and understand an alternative to God. Cant stop you there.|`|GwYeI7Vuaa	I believe in God WAY MORE than evolution! It makes a lot more sense! Plus, if evolution WAS true, and if there wasn't a God, what would be our purpose here???

Tennis practice was canceled (the one thing I actually look forward to). I love my best friend but she always leaves me to go running off with her boyfriend, which hurts me more than anything. Of course, he is her boyfriend. I'm pretty sure she is finally getting tired of seeing me around too. More than likely, she's going to cut me off sooner or later. I had 4 different projects assigned to me today with one of them due this Thursday. My friends always seem to use me for my stuff. Yeah, life sucks. But compared to other days, this was probably one of the better ones.

R4jDg5Ksaa	I first seen this website (it was advertised on myspace) today. I clicked out of curiosity. I remember learning about the Mayan calender and whatnot in one of my history lectures. Going to the site I was thinking meh heh. lol Kind of like Oh My gosh with an eye roll. I learned that it doesn't necessarily mean the end of the world, it's the end of the world as we KNOW it. Meaning drastic changes.   This website completely makes me think it should be a movie. You know this company shows up, supposedly hidden in secret until now. Some people laugh, some freak and take part in "the lottery" and then catastrophe happens and people are scrambling to get in on it.   I don't put too much stock in it. Besides. If it's the end of the world then it's the end of the world. I've we're supposed to survive we will. That's just my opinion.
LPO8RlVdaa	Is anyone else getting really annoyed with that wild man of borneo idiot?    I assume here you know the biblical history behind it. One of the myths about the Ark is that it had the power to make an army invincible, destroying all in its path. That is possibly one of the reasons Hitler tried looking for it!|`|GPrw1JZkaa	One of the most famous of the Bible Myths is the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Its said to be a sacred container that was built from commands from God in accord with Moses prophetic vision on Mount Sinai.   God is said to have communicated with Moses from between the two cherubim on the Arks Cover. The Myth of the Ark was made a bit more known to the public because of the Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark. The Ark is thought to perhaps offer mythical powers and could possibly be a link to God himself.  The Ark being a sacred container was said to hold an array of sacred items. The Bible mentions the Ark as containing the two stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments , a golden jar containing some of the manna from the Israelites trek in the wilderness , the rod of Aaron that budded. It is said that the rod and golden jar may have been removed from the Ark at some point prior to the building of Solomons Temple.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.

1f2movZZaa	I've had to be creative with gifts for quite some time, since I'm in college, and therefore have little if any money to spare. Here are some of the things you could do which cost you nothing or very little (I tend to do a few of these to "pamper" my friends and loved ones as much as I can):    -Photo album or scrapbook full of old photos and memories. Especially of the two of you together. You can put in photographs, little notes to each other, or just things that remind you of her.    -Bath salts (these are pretty popular - everyone loves to be able to soak and relax in the tub), bubble bath, fancy soaps, body wash. You can also make bath salts very easily. For every half-pound of epsom salt (pretty cheap), mix a couple tablespoons of baking soda (for the fizziness), and a couple of drops of essential oil (make sure its essential oil rather than fragrance, because the second one can cause allergic reactions). Some of the popular oils are rose or lavender. You could also add the appropriate dried herbs in with the bath salt (lavender for the lavender bath salt, or rose petals for the rose bath salt), but make sure to put them in a little pouch to keep the petals from clogging up the drain. To do this, just take a small square of fabric, something that water can pass through, usually a transparent fabric works best for effect. Place about a fourth of a cup (or a little less) of the salt into the center, and tie it with a fabric ribbon. You could even make a few of these, and all she has to do is toss the bath "tea bag" into the tub. The salt will dissolve and the herbs will fill the air with heavenly aromas.    -Baked goods, and chocolate. You can't go wrong. Depending on your cooking abilities, you can make anything from chocolate chip cookies wrapped up nicely, to my favorite, anise biscotti. You can find a multitude of recipes on www.allrecipes.com, sorted by rating. Biscotti isn't actually very hard to bake at all, so if you're feeling courageous, its a huge hit. Use vanilla and anise extract for flavoring, throw some crushed almonds into the batter, and when its all cooked up, dip the bottom in chocolate and let it solidify. Brownies or Blondies are also great.    -Since you're going to be at your father-in-law's place, set up an at-home date. Decide what kind of dinner sounds delicious, and buy all of the ingredients for it. Don't forget dessert, too, and maybe even an appetizer. Buy some nice candles, and wine or champagne, and have a genuine candle-lit dinner.    -If you're thinking of a more laid-back, casual sort of way to spend the evening, you can always watch a movie. Make some popcorn at home, and snuggle up in a blanket.    -If she has a favorite author or loves reading, get her a book she'd like. A great compliment to this gift is to make a bookmark. Spend a few bucks at the local craft store on a couple different sheets of scrap-booking paper (It's about .50 to .99 per sheet where I go), some nice beads, and have some string or ribbon on hand. Figure out which paper you'd like as the background, and cut from it about the size you'd like your bookmark to be. Next, from another type of paper, cut a strip that is the same height, but slightly narrower, so that a fourth of an inch or so will show of the paper behind it. Glue it on top. Punch a hole in the top, tie the ribbon or string there, and decorate the end(s) with the beads. The more important part is that, on the back of the bookmark, write a little note to her about how much you love her.    -If your wife likes music, and if you have any blank CDs lying around, burning a CD is always an easy thing to add to the gift you give her. Pick out her favorite songs, or songs that remind you of her. Either use a CD label for the front of the CD, or using a sharpie, give it a title and write her a little note.    -Love Coupons. On some of that nice paper, cut out small strips of it. Write a little favor on each of them. Some ideas are: breakfast in bed, a night out, a kiss, etc. Anything you can think of. Make a nice stack of them and tie them with a ribbon.    -Write her a love letter. Or a poem, if you're up to it. Pour your heart into it, write it on nice paper (but make sure to hand write it - don't type it). I guarantee it'll be the gift that she'll never forget. Words are very powerful, and shouldn't be underestimated.    -Flowers. Everyone gets flowers for Valentine's, but the thing to remember is that you can do this many different ways. You can get cut flowers; roses are the norm, but try to think outside the box. Stargazer lilies, for instance, will sweep her off her feet. Also, try a living plant. You could get her something fancy like an orchid, or something a little more simple, like potted forget-me-nots. If she's big on culinary stuff, try some chives or basil.    -February, around where I live, is the coldest part of the year. It's a perfect time for hot chocolate, mochas, coffee, and hot tea. If she's a hot cocoa fan, look up a re

AA11982425	According to Dean Martin:    How do you speak to an angel  I'm completely in the dark  When you know that you've just met an angel  Is there a proper remark    We were alone for a moment  Why was I lost in a cloud  Do you speak to an angel in a whisper  Or do you just say I love you out loud    We were alone for a moment  Why was I lost in a cloud  Do you speak to an angel in a whisper  Or do you just say I love you out loud|`|AA11830534	There's no specific way to speak to angels, you don't necessarily have to speak softly. Once you get to know the Angel, you'll know how to speak to him / her.  I'm used to interacting with angels, I work with several, ones kinda of boisterous and loud, I can laugh with him tell jokes, etc. Another doesn't speak the same language I do so we communicate with eye contact, and coffee. While some of the others are more laid back, and even a little shy, and so I treat them and speak to them accordingly..|`|oP3VVW5raa	Just as you would speak to anyone :    With respect.    The hard part is listening.    I came across this little story recently about a man talking to his barber :    The man said to his barber as he cut his hair, " Do you believe in God ?".  The barber replied, "No".  "No ?'' queried the the customer.  ''Yes, no, I do not believe in God.  Look at this hobo outside", the barber went on, "If God existed he would not allow his people to go around homeless and unkempt.  But God does not listen to the hobos prayer".  The man listened quietly to the barber, then thanked him when he was done, paid and left.     Within a moment he was back at the door of the barbers.  The barber said "Did you leave something behind ?".  "No", replied the man, "I don't believe in you".  "What ?, said the barber quite taken aback. "You don't believe in me, but I am real I just cut your hair".    "If you were real'', replied the man, "You would cut that hobos hair and beard for nothing.   But you don't listen''.                                          ~~~~~~~~~    Good question !|`|fyrj50Braa	Very early in the morning as soon as you wake lay still and talk to them as a question quietly to yourself and you will here the answer it's always the first one you here.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Normal voice and listen VERY carefully when she replies.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Just speak in a normal voice. If it's coming from your heart, it will be heard.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	There are many ways for you to contact angels but you can just speak out loud as you would to a friend or just think the words in your head. Always to remember to say thank you for their time when you have finished.  Many people set aside a special time each day or week, like making a date to meet up with a family member or friend for lunch. When most people say their prayers before they go to sleep, I spend time talking to the Angelic Guardians that are around me. I thank them for watching over me and my family, animals, friends etc and I always ask them to support and guide me through the following day. I am not a religious person and I separate angels from what is believed to be God, however that is my preference, most others that I know put them both together.  I also use meditation and self guided visualisation to connect with the angelic realms. Guided visualisation cd's can be obtained from most new age shops, or internet sites such as ebay. They usually cost between 8 and 15.  I hope this helps you, if you feel that I can help you further, please feel free to email me.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	I too don't know how to talk to angels. All I do is thank God for sending an angel to watch over my children and grandchildren.

First prayer is Angel of God, my darling dear, to whom God's love commits me here. Ever this day (night) be at my side to watch, to guard, to rule and guide Amen.  Second is -O my Good Angel who God has appointed to be my guardian, enlighten and protect me,direct and govern me during this day (night) Amen. I also never use an alarm clock I simply ask my Guardian Angel to waken me at a certain time. Try it.......it works!|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Oh, Under Pressure.....you devil you!.....lol.

FF4J59pMaa	You can get him something that represents something he really likes. Like if he likes football a football jersey of his favorite team. Guys aren't very sentimental so things that you would like aren't a good idea like pictures or things like that. Unless its like a funny picture you guys took. Then that would be really cute! A funny but loving card would be good too. You can be sentimental without going overboard. Get him a movie he's wanted to buy or even something like a nice watch. My dad always gets my mom a teddy bear thats a lion cause my mom loves lions. You can start some type of tradition like that with him. He might like some Sees chocolates too.|`|ZivgciCLaa	Here are some nice choices:    1. Gift card to his fav place.  2. Love.  3. A getaway.  4.

Vv465eJMaa	Your right,but we live in a way that we no longer say nice things to each other or acknowledge how we value someone.It is all taken for granted.  Christmas with gift giving and Valentines give us a nudge to say and give what we take for granted each day.It makes us take stock and reflect on things.  Of course money is the real motive for companies,but you can still get something from it on a personal level|`|FF4J59pMaa	Yeah it probably is just a way for companies to make money but it is a sweet gesture. Of course you know your husband or boyfriend loves you with out getting a card or anything like that but its nice to see that they think about you and take time to buy you something. I think its so romantic when they bring you a bunch of flowers and chocolates. It just gives you a way to show your affection because some people aren't very good with words. I don't think people should be getting mad because they didn't get them anything cause I mean come on you seriously have to be materialistic to be acting like that. But I think it is a good holiday. Its not just about boyfriend or husband love its a day to show all the people you love them. I always get my closest friends something. Its not anything big but like a box of chocolates. My parents always buy is a valentines day teddy bear and a little thing of chocolates.|`|GyCGI09Yaa	anotther day 2 me even when i was with my ex|`|jky64DZ8aa	i think the idea in general is nice, although i agree its a day for big companies to make money and i dont think it should be over done  but something about it makes it feel more special  i feel closer to my boyfriend and i just like to show him how much i care even though he knows already  its good to spend time together properly as we dont live together its something i dont get to do very often and it means a lot to me    although i would hate it if i was single...i used too|`|tk7qxYcpaa	worst day ever in my opinion, but thats only if ur single.|`|qFtBqFx0aa	The same could be said for Christmases and birthdays then...

hHjPFxEdaa	Try asking. Not even Asians can always tell by looking and the doofusses who said eyes are doofusses. Even if you could tell Japanese eyes from Chinese that still leaves a lot of other Asian nationalities. Could you tell them all by their eyes? Smh.|`|i9XnU8pkaa	koreans have "pie" faces    chinese people have full, wide noses    If a person has the surname "Nguyen," they're Vietnamese    Filipinos are mixed with spanish....ex : "Pagara" for a last name    Japanese.......listen to them speak.

Of course, you could just ask "What's your ethnicity" without sounding too excited about it.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	Ask them where they are from.|`|StRaKUf6aa	You ask them.

However, China has long been settled by people from all over the place, so it's really hard to tell. Chinese people have a very diversified look.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I don't try to go there, because no matter what you assume about someone's appearances you can always be proven wrong.  (Example:  Some African-looking folks may actually be from the Caribbean or whatnot, a pasty red-hair guy may be from Brazil, etc.)  If you are really interested you can ask them what their ethnic background is, but do try to do so with tact.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	You have to educate your ethnometer by becoming personally familiar with people of the various ethnic Asian groups. Once you know what you're dealing with, you can tell by facial features, body language, and accent what kind of asian an asian is. Same as Africans can tell a Hutu from a Tutsi at a glance.|`|fbama92eaa	To me it's very simple, you can tell by their names and their language. If they are an American born of Asian decent, you can tell by their surnames. You don't go up and ask "What Asian Ethnicity are you?", I think it's kind of rude, you can simply just ask their name.    It's obvious that Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans are much more similar in appearance as well as the other South East Asians. We're not much different than each other, besides the obvious nationalities. But what differs within the nationalities is the histories and languages and customs. Then you have those who look different because of their geographical locations. The more Northern they are or descended from, they tend to have single eyelids that are lower and the more sothern they are, the more rounder their eyes appear to be.|`|PQ1vBjFdaa	ask them. can you tell white or black people apart?  as an asian, i could kind of narrow it down for you though.  east asians tend to be lighter than southeast asians.  filipinos kind of look like mexicans. they kind of look like a cross between east asians and mexicans.|`|9XA7KxK5aa	If a chinese, a korean and a japanese wear the same fashion and stand in a line to let people guuess what country they are from, it is almost no way for people to guess it right.    About the size and shape of eyes, southern chinese eyes are bigger and rounder than northern chinese, japanese and koreans' because of climate adaptation.

Im also atheist, I sometimes get some sh*t. I would NEVER ever stop being friends with some one if my other friends disliked them. True friends wouldnt do that. Youll find better friends and a boyfriend (if you want one) just ignore her.|`|W4ZxbmcEaa	Easier said than done, darlin, but - if she's going to dump you because no one likes you then she's not that great a friend, is she?  Why have her around when she won't stand up for you?      After the hurt, shrug it off and find some real people to be friends with. :)|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	Sorry to say your best friend is incredibly shallow (like most in school).    EVERYONE says they'll never put their love interest before their friends, but guess what?  It happens all time.  Time to find some REAL friends.      For what it's worth, there's not a single person I went to school with, that I can tell you anything about now.  They're all in the past.|`|f9269cf9fa662fc5360d3c82afdf9320aa	Yeah, it happens.  But do they Hate you ?  That is a pretty strong emotion.  If these people are 'haters' you are better off without them.  You'll come out ahead without these type of people in your life so rejoice!  And surely, don't give in to their little games by quitting school.  I am sure you will find friends, true friends who will value you for what you are.  So hang tight and keep your chin up, you will come out the winner in the end.|`|SJwRbuBHaa	I am sorry, that really stinks.    I have lost friends very dear to my heart..yeppers.,I am sorry you have to go through this right now.|`|UPMRdb4maa	your best friend "abandoned" you? gosh thats hard i dont know how long you have been friends but just to abandon you for the sake of a boyfriend she wasent your best friend to begin with.  i have a best friend who i grew up with since 7moths old(and he was 5 months old at the time) from then we went to kindergarten elementary and high school together. we have been separated(i live in Britain and he lives in Australia now) for 9 years now but we still keep in touch like every weekend or 2. he is like my brother now. now i dont know if your relationship was as deep as mine, but if it was sooner or later she will come back with or without a boyfriend  cheers.|`|3aEQqoM8aa	she was no real friend of yours to begin with that's why i don't have alot of girl "friends" there all stab in the backs.  sorry but that's how i feel guys are so much easier to be friends with even some of the straights are better.|`|8JTxTBvfaa	Yesssss :'(...  It hurts "really" bad, and you feel lonely once They tell you.  But you have to remind yourself that they must not of been such a good friend if they decided end the relationship over something REALLY stupid..  And I don't want any part of someone that makes stupid choices as that =/|`|UDr6FD2Zaa	People say a lot of things . She said what she said and she should stick to it, however people change . Just as some one may say they will love you for ever and always be there , and then a year later the brake up with you . She might feel very  unhappy about the hole thing. She is your friend , but she loves her BF and its the hole " Look at me I am in the cool group now " syndrome we all love to hate so much .    I mean my true feelings on this is, if she could not sit you down and explain to you how she really feel . Then she is not your friend ....and you should just move on . Ya it hurst sure, but do you really wont some like that around you ?? I would not....but I am strong person .    I think you should talk to her tell her how you feel, but straight forward . Then move on .
FwJLD1uDaa	i dont know, and i wish i did. i am single too and its kinda sad around valentines day, but then i look at my parents and feel better because i see how much they love each other and it tells me that there is hope for me - im young still and i know the right boy is out there somewhere...|`|jsS03HSNaa	Like crap.  This boy kissed me on V-Day in 1st grade, and I told the teacher.  Stupid, I know.  Turns out this boy is now the hottest guy in my half of the state and won't even look at me in Church, because we go to different high schools now.  Drives me crazy.  To make myself feel better, I go on yahoo answers and give goofy answers to lovey dovey questions.  Then, on V-Day, I tell my parents I love them then watch some stupid satire or really gory movie.  Tip- avoid The Notebook at all costs.
Qmgn6JHLaa	Yes.  Assuming this is in the U.S., if your neighbor refused to sell alcohol to someone based on their disability, he'd violate Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (which prohibits discrimination based on disability by private businesses) and, likely, state anti-discrimination laws.|`|AA11247439	yes of course they are allowed       if fact if you refused to sell to them you could be sued for discrimination|`|fAcVndo7aa	If the person is old enough to buy alcohol, then yes.  Not selling it to them could constitute discrimination.|`|pckuIRhsaa	Of course. Anyone who buys alcohol has a mental disability.|`|jKmbJyxJaa	If they're old enough, I don't see why not. I'm not aware of any law saying they can't.|`|BevylvVSaa	Sell it to him/her. It is against the law NOT TO. People with disabilities have all the same rights as anyone else - unless they have a guardian. And since there is no way anyone can tell if a person has a guardian - you have to assume they don't.     You can ask for ID - and must accept driver's licenses and state IDs.    http://www.moonmoss.com/resources/newsle...    http://www.justanswer.com/questions/jy4m...
LPO8RlVdaa	Common heritage, also known as diffusion, is the most likely theory I think. Great events such as the flooding of many cultures after the thawing of the last great ice age (circa 10.500 BCE) would have been catastrophic and resonated through many different cultures, leading to a variety of myths and cultural legends based on one event.     Others such as the myths of great heroes are deep in the human subconcious and so will always find a way into the popular myth of many cultures. They are just basic archetypes, heroes, damsels in distress, etc.     Then of course, there was always people who traded and travelled, swapped stories and embellished them.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Cos maybe they are true.....hmm???|`|UxlL89rHaa	People spread throughout the world over time taking there stories and beliefs with them.|`|HUMn6SMaaa	You have to keep in mind that people in general have a common heritage. Most of the old world certainly share a common ancestry. and it is possible that many of our abstract ideas stem from such an ancestry, not just our languages.     Contrary to what some one has said about leading back to atlantis myths(Rot). Early civilisations are the seed from which modern man has grown. We are aware of factual cultures in the so called cradles of civilisation and then of course we have the ancient cultures of the Egyptians, and Minoans the biblical lands and Greece and Rome.    Not to mention the peoples who were responsible for the Megalithic cultures. Evidence for which is to be found blatantly littering most of north western Europe and it's atlantic seaboards. We don't know enough about these guys but they must have at least orally passed on the legacy of their cultural psyche into evolving cultures.    Then of course as cultures and societies grew up and evolved, often side by side there was trade, and commerce and this in turn would have led to the traffic of stories, concepts and beliefs.|`|uzVaMiMUaa	Some of the myths have undoubtedly spread through human migration. Others can be related to the human subconscious and the desire to make sense of their surroundings and bare similarity through geography.  Myths and folklore about plants and animals can be related directly to their common usage which bares similarity through out all cultures.|`|08a92b58f4c232dc4f67d55c8ffecf70aa	ain't we wonder why every normal human has two eyes, nose with two hole, hand with 5 finger each...?    (because others being killed and called monster?)|`|c0525648e7f1a8cbba7c650f4cec06ceaa	Synchronistic archetypes manifest through the collective unconscious of many cultures.  The same gods and constellations have different names in different cultures.  Also because the same myths led to other versions of the story in other places.  The historic myths were told in different ways by different cultures who experienced them.  The same principles and paths are represented in the universal story of man in different expressions but with universal themes.    In the case of the flood it's a historical myth experienced by different cultures and hence it became part of their story.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	There are two possible reasons.  First, diffusion, the idea that there was a common, ancient culture from which the ideas originated and then spread as humans migrated across the planet.  The second is parallel development which argues that the structure and processes of the human brain are common amongst all peoples and so the same symbols and metaphors to explain the natural world developed amongst people without any contact between the cultures.      The idea of diffusion has fallen out of favor with most scholars.  It leads you down the path of an ancient, lost civilization such as Atlantis.  The idea of parallel development gained a lot of strength from the work of Carl Jung and his archetypes as well as the comparative mythology scholar Joseph Campbell.
k3TKEOJBaa	Hey Sweetie, well first of all oral is sex and you have to be real careful it's hard when your young and I know exactly what you mean but I think it is best to play it safe and wait for the right one it makes it so much more special that just a cheap thrill. Please think this one out before you make an action people admire strong beliefs in something and if its something you dont want to do yet please dont its not worth it there are so many bad things and sorry people out there who want there piece of booty and then just say thanks and bye its very hurtful to feel used. But as I always say you are the only one who can take care of you just be careful and if you decide to play use protection.|`|4tFuosueaa	Oral sex IS sex and even though you can't get pregnant, you can still get Aids that way.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	It is worth it  - WHEN YOU ARE READY FOR IT!    And only you can know this. So, don;t do anything you feel you are not ready for. YOU are the person that will know if you are - no one else.    Anyone that pressures you to do something that you don;t want to do is NOT your friend.|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	The emotional implications associated with any sexual relationship aren't worth it. Enjoy being young while you can. There's no need to jump into something just because everyone else is doing it.|`|meqoZf0zaa	You shouldn't feel obligated to do what you don't want..Oral, like sex, still comes with it's emotional baggage and if you feel you're not ready for it, you shouldn't do it no matter who is..
BevylvVSaa	Such places have very long waiting lists. I suggest you look into hiring someone to take care of him while he is living with his mom as an immediate solution.    Longer term, look into buying or renting him a house/apartment with 2 or more bedrooms. The second bedroom is for a live in caregiver. The caregiver gets free room and board and a small salary. If it has more than two bedrooms - advertise for a roommate with similar disabilities and the caregiver takes care of 2 people instead of one.|`|jjt2enntaa	That's a tough one.  Mental illness is so difficult for everyone involved.  I would start by asking this man's psychiatrist or physician.  If the physicians don't know, I would think they could give you information of who to contact who would know.  If his physician treats other people with mental illness they may very well treat some patients who are in a nursing home.|`|bSqzbDPFaa	i work in a personal care home that has mainly mentally disabled adults. its in pennsylvania. most of them act like children and they go to outside facilities for counseling and do lots of activites with and outside the home. look up homes in your area in the yellow pages. call and ask lots of questions. tour the different places and take your bosses brother along to see if he is comfortable there.
wR1XyyrUaa	The thing is, anyone could be an atheist, and you would never know it unless you asked. Few atheists go around wearing "Death to religion" shirts...|`|AA11923447	Of course not. I have many atheist friends, and would hate to be without their company. I support freedom of religion, which includes freedom from religion. Why should I discriminate against people just because they don't share my religious beliefs?|`|fEkKuGlEaa	It would make some of them happy.     I'd like to think my friends who are atheists would miss me, though.|`|q5rTjkjgaa	no i have some good christian friends...well im not atheist no more but i dont want to not have the atheist friends i have now because they dont believe like i do im not christian i think its stupid almost as stupid as scientology|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Ah, but the atheist cooties are an invisible plague. You (or they? which one are you?) will never know until it's too late...|`|9vLJbiHeaa	i no !!  but i think everyone is entitled to thier opinion and thier beliefs so why are some people so bothered by other peoples beliefs?  athiest have thier belive which is that there is no god  as a christain i belive there is a god but i still respect the athiest belive as well as keeping mine.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I'd say that Christians should avoid ANYBODY else like the plague.  The rest of the world would be a much better place if they did; they cause nothing but problems, in my experience.    Maybe we should have some kind of anti-fraternization law???? ;-)|`|MdyHKQRGaa	If that means they won't invade public schools anymore, than sure.  I joke, of course.|`|V0oc22ryaa	No, they need Christ and salvation, it doesn't hurt to befriend them and be friendly towards them (as with all men) but be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers does apply.|`|AA11008046	It is the responsibility of all christians to teach about Jesus.  You can't be active in witnessing for christ if you avoid people.  If you are talking to an atheist and they do not want to hear your teaching, honor their wish.  God does not honor bully tactics in witnessing for Him.  Those who do not wish to receive your doctrine has the right not to.  It is their free choice.  However, there will be a day when they will bow and they may not like the end result.|`|MK0cqBCfaa	I'm athiest and I have a lot of christian friends. We smoke pot and discuss spirituality with eachother. Its really great.|`|4HUZJdVNaa	You christians cannot avoid running into us atheists are everywhere you go and we will haunt you and scare you|`|HIskrREJaa	are you afraid that we will give you cooties?    ***  no, that wouldn't make me happy to do that. more than half of my family is christian or religious of some sort..|`|k1W70RHFaa	No.    See, there will be hateful people in whichever group.
DArAz67Caa	all could learn from the word of God----all could learn from Evangelic teachings-----they are the most clear path to God and the heavens---|`|AA10223196	I am a Christian and in my non-denominational church, I can really relate to the sermons on Sunday.  My preacher talks about common sins we commit like adultery, drugs and alcohol, lying, cheating, putting other gods before God like money, computers, TV, etc.  Of course I don't do any of those things but I can relate to ordinary people and their sins against God.      I learn something every Sunday about asking God for help and worshiping Him without asking for anything.  I learn about the importance of helping others in need and loving my enemies.  Sometimes I share what I learn with my friends.|`|asX2hxFXaa	Well, it depends on the sermon.  You can't ask such a broad question and expect a specific answer.    If the sermon applies to me, than I learn from it.  If the sermon has absolutely nothing to do with me, then perhaps someone I know could learn from it.|`|31cc91292d4acf2ddc9a6d449e86868eaa	"Man what a great message!

Sometimes when you go to a church, temple, or synagogue you can really learn how to act everyday on normal things|`|8OeulLkmaa	Depends upon the message.  Sometimes I think, "I sure hope Sister so and so is paying attention" but most of the time it's about me.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	i listen..i like what they preach up there..allot of it is also fun...preachers aren't always fire and brimstone ministers..they add lots of humor in their sermons...after all they want to keep our attention...yes..i can relate to allot of their sermons..the preachers seem to come up with sermons that touch everybodys life..because nobody is perfect or without sin|`|NDTLeIUKaa	a synagogue is a temple    I listen to what is said and imagine the story as it happened.  then i try to apply what i l;earned to my own life.  i'm Christian, and my Church doesn't bad mouth others like other Christian Churches I used to go to, so I don't think that "wow, that sounds just like so and so", or anything like that.  I used to go to a couple of Churches that were fire and brimstone kinda sermons, mega millionaire obese preachers, etc.  they all had the same scam, and it involved the audience thinking exactly like that, that anyone who was not in THIS church was going to hell.

But that, I will likely only end up getting hurt opening up like that, or that he doesnt even care anymore anyways.  But, I have to try.  But I dont know how.  Its too big a mess.    My heart being in it is part motivation, but its also a handicap here, adding complex emotions to the mix.  But, on a moral level, what I did was so very wrong.  Is there any way to make it right, or will I just have to live with what Ive done.

Why cant people just answer the question and leave it alone? anyway about your question, i have the same problem but what i do is talk like a retard and pull my pants down past my waist to mock the gangser wannabes. When someone asks you if you are emo, i say in a sarcastic way of course "Yes, yes i am. If it makes u feel special then yes" then i whisper loud enough so they can hear "f a g g o t"    or you can just say dont judge me. Dont lable me. Or what i also do is shrug it. You can do what adults tell you and ignore them. hope i helped|`|JMJsCU1vaa	kids would find another thing to tease you about... they try different things to find out what gets a rise out of you, and then they hammer away at it..  Actually you'll be picked on just because you're the only white-boy in the class, I hd a same situation when I was your age and it was right after MLK was assassinated, so it was clearly racial...  Today it's not readily acceptable to be racist, so they cover it up with something else, but in your case it's because your a minority in their class..  Ignore the comments, and they will eventually tire of trying to tease you when you no longer show that you get upset over it.  In fact if you laugh at them, it might even expedite them stopping, but could also provoke something if they feel the joke has backfired on them.  Isn't racism fun?.... NOT|`|sQq8q4Biaa	well from personal experience you cant really be emo without someone giving you hell, if your lonely and/or depressed , I know how you feel... I go to school where the black to white ratio is like 3:1 and im white but its not the black kids that give me hell, they fear me and im not sure why. I don't consider myself "scary" but that's just me, and are you emo cuz if not don't dress it cuz it'll depress you even more but if you are, IM me I'm always on at all hours of the day, Emos really need some1 to talk to cuz if I didn't have my friend Felicity to help me I would have killed myself a week ago... talk to me, I can try to help|`|zWLlxZMeaa	Don't...dress...emo?

If you wanna pull off saying that you slit your wrists whenever you go home to relieve the pain, dress and act how you feel you want to, which people usually call emo. But, dress and act how you want to, don't go with labels and what not. If people make fun of you, just ignore them. If you don't say anything or give them anything to feed off besides your outward appearance, they'll eventually get bored and stop.
30b5fac62378b9be69757aa6b696edf4aa	Typically, lesbians do not think that sex with men is hot nor do we want to have sex with men...on that note I would have to say that you are probably bi, with a preference for women : )|`|m2cxGTwgaa	Theres nothing wrong with liking both men, and women.

NlzlBV8Haa	Yes I do.  Nobody has a perfect theology, thankfully we don't need to - as Jesus's finished work on the cross is enough to atone for everything in our lives.

The long answer would take a book to explain.|`|cIPziIdnaa	Well putting aside for a minute the fact that there's only been one good Christian - and we crucified Him - yes, I believe Creationism and Evolution are not mutually exclusive theories, and one can be a Christian and accept both.  After all - evolution does not explain the origin of intelligent life.    Only God can do that.|`|sFAtAWE8aa	You have already abandoned all reason by believing in an imaginary friend in the sky and a zombie jew who has super-powers...so might as well go the full monty.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	not from what I have heard.|`|ysVNRN6Laa	They're bootleg christians, sorry.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	im not christian but i used to be and i think i can answer your ?.    my friend is the same way. he believes that god created animals and dinosuars and such and we elvoved from their. he doesnt beleive that the whole shabang started with adam and eve( he believes that adam and eve came later)|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Absolutely.    Evolution does not explain how it all started, it just explains how it progresses.    There are MANY people and scientits who are creationists, and believe that 7 days is not literal, but was a progression over 10000's years of evolution.    If you think about it, how did the fossil fuels get there, and everything that was historically how is it helping us progress now...    Intelligent plan perhaps?|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Not really.  To believe in evolution, one must reject God's Word.   Compromise beliefs, like the "Gap Theory" which blends the two belief systems, have for the most part been deemed heresy.     The Vatican has embraced evolution.  They've been wrong before.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Yes.  I do not believe God is close minded.  I have always felt this way.  God gave us the option of choice.  We can choose our own path.  If we couldn't it would make for one dull world!|`|eAMq1iBWaa	No way    If Adam and Eve never existed then neither did Jesus because He descended from them.    1Ti 6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:        1Ti 6:21 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.

That Christian would have to have little knowledge of the Bible.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Jesus confirmed the literal truth of the Adam and Eve creation account, and Genesis is literal.

Truth is constant, and truth has two best friends: time and consistency. The truth never changes, only the circumstances surrounding the truth changes. Truth also "makes sense" and can be proved over any period of time simply by applying syllogistic logic. Needless to say, we all have our "opinions" that could be argued as our own personal truths, but at the end of the day when all evidence has been presented someone's opinion will become a fact, and someone else's opinion will remain just that; an opinion.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Yes, 'by God' -  it is!  :D  And what is right or wrong for me won't be for someone else!

Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible factor in the philosophy of the universe. Evolving personalities are only partially wise and relatively true in their communications. They can be certain only as far as their personal experience extends. That which apparently may be wholly true in one place may be only relatively true in another segment of creation. Page 42-3|`|R8K9H21Uaa	This might help-    The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making.    With our concept making apparatus called "mind" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The ideas-about- reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept.    We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids.    A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle.            Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.            DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.            The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the ERISTIC ILLUSION.            The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.            Reality is the original Rorschach.|`|mSFjbetxaa	I like the words of the Buddha:      "Believe nothing, no matter who has said it, not even if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and own common sense." --Buddha        None of us knows, for sure, the truth spiritually.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Well, the big bang theory is true for some, but not for all...

I find that to be true, because if you look around today in regards to religion, I find the Egyptian Faith to be accurate, although the creation story is out in left field, but I hold it true for reasons I don't quite understand, but I do. You have Christians and Muslims who are the same way who will defend their faith against all others. Atheists defend their non-belief against those whom push their faith onto them.

That's really all there is to it.    When I broke up with my first boyfriend, I learned that what is considered "real" is strongly linked to perception. He said that he was innocent and only did good for me in which I threw in his face by "abandoning him". I said he was a total jerk and did mostly abusive things to me in which I had to escape, but constantly tried to return to. The only way to know which one is the truth is to have witnessed it yourself (I was right by the way; I had people around who in fact witnessed it and I was right...).    When you have a lot of "he said, she said" going on, you can NEVER tell what really happened unless you were there yourself. That's what happens in religion; its basically a lot of "he said, she said" because none of us are truly "there" to know what's the actual reality. Therefore, we can only choose sides and decide to accept this as our reality, as our truth. We will learn what is the actual reality at the end.    Did that make sense?|`|WdAuncq9aa	islam is the true  In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.    Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "(It is) Allah."

Or the depths of darkness equal with light?" Or do they assign to Allah partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar?

q7Y06Xxcaa	I believe that abortions need to be up to the women themselves. It is the way it is today. Those who believe it is murder believe it enough to want to impose their beliefs on others. They want to take away a personal choice that each woman has.  There are people who abuse it. That is wrong, it isn't meant to be a birth control method. But the 15 year old who was talked into having sex with the incredibly cute boy, who ended up pregnant, and alone. I think she deserves the right to decide if she is ready to provide. Or the 14 year old who was raped, and ended up pregnant. What kind of life would those babies live?   Abortion is a personal choice, just like religion.   As I said earlier it shouldn't be abused. But just because some people think they are right, and want to impose, and bully others into agreeing. It isn't going to happen, as long as their are rape victoms, and young people having sex!!!!!|`|KJAKihaCaa	I am very Pro Life and i think it is murder but i don't try to force my beliefs on others  But I do think there should be therapy available for women who get abortions cause i would think that it's very rough.

On one hand, I have my general philosophy which is: Take responsibility for your actions.  If you willingly have sex and get pregnant, then you should be responsible and have the baby.  Abortion is a way to make people find a way out of facing the consequences of their actions.  If a girl doesn't want a baby, then either 1) Dont have sex;  2) Get your tubes tied; 3) Use pregnancy pills, condoms, and female condoms (close to 100% effective as you can get when used together);  Basically, I feel that if you make a decision, even if you don't like the outcome, you should take responsibility for your decision and accept the results.  I am pro-choice in the sense that the girl has a choice: sex or no sex.    I have mixed feeling about women who are impregnated by rape or who will die by giving birth.  For being raped, it was not their decision, so my philosophy of "take responsibility for your actions" can't really be applied.  However, I don't feel that an unborn baby should be denied birth either.  For the women who will die by giving birth, I have not yet formed an opinion, because it is pretty much impossible to decide which life is more important.     Whether abortions should be banned or not....I personally am against them, but that doesn't give me the right to enforce that view upon others.  Before that decision can be made, many opinions on abortion such as whether fetuses count as human beings must be established.|`|k8AUdPnfaa	Well abortion is just cruel who wants to KILL a living creature!

To pro-lifers, abortion is an issue they clearly feel strongly about as it involves the killing of innocent unborn babies.  2. People who are pro-life can be very defensive about their viewpoint, as people who are pro-choice are not generally understanding of their position and can also be quite rude.|`|AA10451488	I've always found it interesting that the people with so much "respect for life" have little respect for how people choose to live.

While there is nothing wrong with HAVING ideals, and idealist is so hyper-committed to an idealist view that he will deny or distort his reality rather than adjusting that ideal to better fit the real world. An authoritarian believes that departure from the norm must be punished or order will not be maintained. Abortion hits them from both sides at once. In their ideal world women who do not want children do not become pregnant and abortion does not exist. When forced to face the reality that unwanted pregnancies DO happen, the reaction is feel very threatened by this intrusive and disturbing reality AND to heap punishment on the person who departed from the norm and forced them to deal with this distress. They all need a healthy dose of pragnatism, but if they were pragmatic they'd be busily working to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies instead of going ballistic when it's too late to do anything truly satisfactory.|`|39rXZUeQaa	I don't like the idea of abortions.

I can't and I won't judge anyone who has ever had one or is thinking about it. That is only up to one person and it's not me. If a person wants one or has had one, that is their business and no one else's.     Let me ask you this...I had an ectopic pregnancy that was terminated to save my life.

And how many are children that have been adopted? A big fat ZERO!!!!|`|YJO1O49faa	I completely agree with you. There is no reason to call people murders. We actually have protesters all the time picketing in front of the abortion clinic downtown. I think that it's a good idea depending on your situation.     At my school I found out a 16 year old girl in my photography class is pregnant and she is about to get evicted from her apartment for the 3rd time. They have no money and she barely ever goes to school because she has a job that is more important. I honestly don't think she is in a stable condition to support a baby, and i don't think that's fair to her mom or herself OR THE BABY! Another girl in my circle of friends just had her 4 year old baby (she had the baby when she was 14) taken away because she neglected and now she doesn't know if she has the money to get her back.     I baby should be brought into this world by stable parent(s), how can afford to love and support their bundle of joy. I think if your in school or living with your parents a baby is not right in to bring into the world. There will come a time when a person will have everything a baby needs to survive. If you don't have those necessary items, then I'm sorry but the baby shouldn't be born.    Yes, a baby is living and breathing but the mom has more right over the baby. It's an fortunate situation but it's how life is. It's mom and/or dad's decision no one elses.

If upper middle class whites from the north dropped their R's and said things like "wit" and "fo sho" people as a whole wouldnt be so much against them, but because the faces attatched to these words are typically poor, workin class or black, they dont get cut any slack.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	I don't like urban talk period for the most part, out of anyone's mouth.  Unless it is original.  I find urban slang from whites, blacks, asians, etc...to be overused and cliche phrases become the lazy way of communicating.     Economic circumstances should not effect your diction .  All schools teach standard American English and basic vocabulary.  It's up to you how you to choose to formulate your own words and express yourself.|`|RgymoiIQaa	It just depends on your environment. What you have been subjected to and where you were raised. But being poor and having had hard times isn't why someone would speak one way or another.  It's who you have been around not where.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Lol. I'm black african my accent is mixed with how white people talk and my native country accent.  But I get starred at cuz I have different accent.

Just be sure to sanitize it with some peroxide or alcohol afterwards and put a band-aid on it.    If it's bigger, like say a knife blade, key, or anything...then please just go to the hospital. Don't pull it out, you may bleed to death before you get to the hospital if you don't have enough pressure on it.|`|WjRqYf6naa	The hospital might be your best bet.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	Chuck Norris would gnaw it out with his teeth.

It could be close to a blood vessel or muscle that you could ruin.|`|fspebSraaa	well your taking a risk doing it yourself, you could pull it strait out if its sticking out some or you cut a little and use tweezers if its small. the thing of it is you could still be leaving small debris in and risk infection. good luck with that!|`|IpiFULsPaa	It depends where it is. The major veins in the thigh are located at the inner thigh. The major artery is located on the outer thigh along with the major nerves. So first stop the bleeding, tourniquet if you have to, treat fro shock. Try to numb the leg and get some kind of antiseptic like vodka, whiskey, etc... if the projectile is lodged in the bone make sure to be VERY careful when GENTLY prying it out. Then try to get the projectile out with as little digging or cutting as possible. After it is out CLEAN the wound WELL! Stop the bleeding and then try to find a stong antibiotic and take two a day for fourteen days to prevent a blood/tissue infection. Good luck.
14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	The statement "Spiritually Speaking" is an oxymoron since Spiritual Energy cannot be conveyed on the physical plane since it is not physical.    What "own image" means is that within Man is an access to all levels of Creation and thus, Man is the microcosm within which resides the macrocosm.  This access is Esoteric and hidden from all but those who are "ready" to discover it.    One becomes "ready" by simply completing many, many lifetimes and completing a great deal of Karma.      It was of course Man that gave Neutral Spiritual Energy the name God.  Satan is one name given to the lord of the three lower planes of Creation, who is also the administrator of the MIND, of which each Soul has one.    Peace|`|ysVNRN6Laa	God's God's|`|93aY6WzAaa	You're mixing it up. Nobody created God. God made man in His image. Satan was a screw up.|`|a6SdY0fCaa	If a horse had a god, it would look like a horse.

God created us, but he isnt a human, hes more of a spirit, but I cant even say that, because he isnt anything a human could comprehend.     God exists outside space and time, but we automatically think of him as something, someone created, but hes much more than that. He is Life.     When you say 'in his image' its probably more of a personailty thing?    Emotions; Think we experience all the emotions God does. Love, Sadness, Despair, Joy, Anger etc...theyre things that can only exist because God experiences them.|`|3m00lxxuaa	Nobody. If you believe in a creator, then the Creator should be the creator. If God needed a creator, then would that higher god need one, and where would it end. God is God. Which also means Satan was also a creation, but God doesn't make mistakes, otherwise we'd be a mistake.|`|2LsR22g9aa	Me.|`|IYBTmH26aa	God and Jesus were not created.  They always are.

Satan is a fallen angel.
NrOg2hrZaa	They do not hold eye contact with you when your speaking.  When this happens, they are thinking of way's to leave your company and the conversation.  Depending on the situation.. then comes,  I got to go.  There's so and so, I have to talk to them.  I'll talk to you later.  I'm late for ?? see ya.  etc.etc.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Are they talking to you less and less?  Do they avoid you at all?  Usually they will make it clear so just don't bug them about it.      I know most people aren't as straight-forward as I am.  If someone asks me if they are annoying and that is the case.. I'll tell them clearly that they are.  Most people don't like getting put in that position so they'll either shrug or say "no."  You should be able to read their body language by that point anyways..|`|KBVAbwUXaa	put a hidden video camera in their bathroom|`|S6P9gSX8aa	you should read their body language..  like if they're leaning back or making awkward faces. small talk..|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You can tell by the expression on their face.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	They usually make it clear.|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Body language! You can tell right away if they look uncomfortable and want to exit the conversation right away. If their eyes shift a little bit to look around the room. Or if they roll.     Also listen to the laugh they do, if its forced.. its pretty clear you are annoying them. Body language is always the first sign though

Decode this lyrics " Knowing me knowing you"  Will ask Lucifer the great Satan alive himself in person in "All Blacks" from the twilight zone who was suppose to be in hell.  Will ask Lucifer what is he doing out there in different time zone in time?  Will pass Lucifer a small pocket mirror to have a good look at himself in the mirror.  Pointing out to Lucifer that Mr.Look-see-here was the dirty old man with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ is at the wrong place and in the wrong time in different time zone in time.  Will also ask children of Lucifer too to take a look in the mirror on who is the Son of a dirty old man with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ in "All Blacks" too like Lucifer was their father back in the past with pictures of murals on the walls in the street of Lebanon, Iran and in Iraq too.

Aw9ADXGPaa	I have a Guy friend who just went through this he cried about it. The reason is you were totally and utterly in love with him no doubt about it. you were emotionally attracted to one another as well as physically and the guy my guy friend just broke up with was only physically attracted to him. I say you treasure the moments you two had and move on. you won't fall apart and die. Just find someone else and make great memories with them. But don't force yourself to.|`|AA10953937	Possibly it wasn't what you thought it was.  If you two talked about everything, why didn't the subject of breaking up come up? It was a fad and it's over. I always tell people to enjoy the ride with things and it appears you did.  Thank him for the time and move on.  Mr. Right is trying to find you also. However, he can't as long as you're stuck on your ex.    Good Luck.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Because you are choosing to hold on to him!  My suggestion!  Fill up your spare time!

Remember dating can be fun!|`|HnXSOk2Xaa	sometimes these things take time.

I caught my ex cheating on me and we broke up in 2004. it was around 2007 or 2008 when I could say that I was finally over him for the most part. I still miss him every now and again, but I have healed. I tell you this because everyone is different. It might take some years to get over it and it might take a few weeks in others. It just depends. Just know that you broke up for a reason and you deserve better. I know it is tough, but you will eventually get over him. I would suggest reading a book called "He's Just Not That Into You". I think that would help you. Good luck out there!|`|xIF2lShpaa	You should have moved on by now,as he probably has. You were just in love with the wrong person. You will find someone who is deserving of your love.It sounds like you are a great person.

If it's very sexual, then give him what any guy wants. Sex. But in a romantic way that he will remember. If you guys have more of a love relationship that doesn't revolve around sexual activity, then give him something he likes. Something his favorite color, or his favorite candie's wrapped up for valentine's day. Make sure he knows you love HIM and not his physical qualities.

PHulI9apaa	I have a list of rules (mentally) about not dating friends etc so it takes them out the game. I find it helps a lot!|`|HvIS1Mk1aa	Absolutely nothing at all is wrong with you.    In fact, you reflect with impressive candour that part of the human condition that the naive (and the deliberately deceitful) usually try to deny.    In short, you're just being human.    The predicament you describe is why friendships can't exist where there is sexual attraction.    Man/woman, man/man, woman/woman - the combination just doesn't matter because the principle doesn't recognise gender.    Because you're homosexual you can never have male friends.    Because I'm heterosexual I can never have female friends.    This is because friends don't jump each other - lovers jump each other. So we have accept that the effort needed to keep things platonic with those to whom we are attracted is counter-productive to the formation of a long-lived relationship with them.    For what it's worth, and sexual polarity aside, I have to say I find your honesty very refreshing.    Life's a bytch at times, innit?|`|W4ZxbmcEaa	Put this into your head everytime you start feeling that way:  L O S T   C A U S E.  Seriously - why, oh why in the world would you go careening out of the realm of self control for something that you can never have?     Have you ever had a girl crush on you? This is how she feels.  Think of it on the other side.  There's nothing you can do to make yourself attracted to her.  That's what these guys are feeling too.      Hope this helps.  Remember, LOST CAUSE....|`|XT51fZq7aa	Unrequited feelings,I went through this when I was in college.Its crap but you have to try and not get attached because however you feel you have to respect their sexuality and that they dont feel the same.Youll move on from these infatuations believe me because thats all they are when they dont feel the same,it happens all the time,sometimes even the other way round and thats crap too.
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Spit.  Though technically you are suppose to spit back into your glass and then dump the glass into the pour bucket.  Often people do not swallow it.  Maybe they are the DD.  Maybe currently they are medication that doesn't mix well but would still like a bottle for 2 weeks from now when they are not on those meds.  Maybe the wine WAS that bad.  I've been to several wine tasting where it was just not worth drinking.  For example I feel if you are giving someone a muscadine wine, you need to prerequisite it with this and not just say Flavors of peach.  Ugh!  I've also had numerous people tell me that while I don't like merlot (I like others but I've never had a merlot I liked), I should at least try THIS merlot.  It's terrible just like all merlots and I don't want to drink a whole pour.  Some places do just about 2 oz but some pour about half a glass.    The fact that you only get to taste a few is exactly why you should spit.  If you drink something potent or terrible, your palette will completely mess up the next wine.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	That's what the bucket is there for.  Some of us tour wineries regularly just to see what the coming wines are sizing to be like.  We are hitting a handful of wineries to do this.  We don't want to get drunk in the process.  Many of the wines offered at the winery tasting rooms are young still and haven't developed their full flavor (and we know it)--so they aren't wines we would DRINK at that stage of their aging.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	that's the same question I ask my women.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Most of the judging is done before drinking.

I'm an etsy seller and one of the benefits of the site is you can request custom stuff from the sellers, usually at the same price or a slightly increased price.    I think the idea is GREAT.

"  -Shakespeare    "It is not night when I do see your face." - William Shakespeare    "How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard." - Annie (The Movie)     "If music be the food of love; play on." - William Shakespeare    "My bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep; the more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite."  -William Shakespeare (i don't know if this is appropriate.)

lRGfqnYAaa	Ask yourself: what could it possibly hurt?    I don't think a thank you letter is necessary, but a resume or coverletter would be nice. If you really want the position, I don't see how it would hurt your chances of being accepted. It shows that you're dedicated and thorough in what you do, in my opinion.    Ace the interview? Know what you're talking about. Show confidence and personality. Convey to the person that you're dedicated and want to help out with the hospital. Smile and be positive.    Good luck with the interview.|`|N37Udp4Iaa	Treat it as a interview for a paid job. The hospital are still a professional organisation and would expect its volunteers to act the same.

9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	I think that the man in question should tell his ex-girlfriend (maybe in front of a couple of people) that the relationship is over because they simply weren't compatible. He can then tell her that he does have feelings for you, however, nothing has ever happened between you both and it's now none of her business.    He shouldn't say any more than that and he should just walk away after having said it - no name calling or finger pointing. A statement of fact. The reason for why he needs to do it is because it will say two things about you and this man. Firstly, that he's honourable in that he will stand up and speak the truth during *his* break-up (it's not your relationship and doesn't involve you) and, secondly, he's laying the ground work of respect for you by acting maturely and by not making you take responsibility for something he knows didn't involve you.    If this person cannot confront his ex. in a nice way then you should keep your distance as some other people have suggested because you will be the subject of suspicion. This man had the relationship and he needs to be clear about the messages he's giving out to other people, too, if he truly has feelings for you.        - Pepper.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	"Ex-girlfriend" is the operative word here.      There is no reason that you should not explore this relationship with him.    Good luck to you!|`|AA11482835	I'd give it time before the two of you start to pursue a relationship or start talking about a relationship. His girlfriend is probably not over him and if she's blaming you for their relationship problems, it's best to wait awhile otherwise said gf will keep popping into your relationship. If you're sure that you didn't cause the break up, then you have no reason to feel guilty. In the meantime, I suggest you keep being his friend but keep your distance if the ex comes back into the picture.|`|6eGZGEw4aa	I agree with Iamcrazy..    I would give it time. If he's meant for you, everything will work itself out eventually, but at the moment he still has "baggage," to call it like that, because it's really soon after their breakup.|`|pN0EOoepaa	I would give it time also. He admits he doesnt know what he wants so maybe some alone time will help him straighten out his feelings.     The ex gf I wouldnt worry about, shes hurt it expected. Stay freinds and if this relationship is meant it will happen in time.

6uGxPczpaa	A person "gloats" when they feel they have won a competition or that they have something desirable to others.  It is not considered good sportsmanship to gloat.  For example, if the athlete who won a Gold medal at the Olympics said to the Bronze medal winner : "I'm the greatest, you suck!  I win!", that would be gloating.     Similarly, the prettiest girl at the party might "gloat" when she gets to leave with the richest man, thinking that the other people there might be jealous of her.  Gloating doesn't have to be verbal.  It can be a facial expression denoting smugness or beating one's chest or a victory dance...

Guys don't like getting gifts like that.|`|u5ZjG99Kaa	hmm. im 16 ive had the same gf since i was 12 and she usually gets me candy. and i love her for it. cuz candy is amazing. get him candy. the movie's thoughtful but he's gonna watch it one time and then it'll be done.

I would appreciate that gift. It would have sentimental value. but never really look at the thing more than once.     sometimes a "special" gift is finding out what he's interested in and getting something so fitting that it will make him think you know him better than he thought.     example:   I record music a lot. it's what I want to do with my life. If my girlfriend got me say, a specific microphone say, a Sennheiser E602 - I would be thrilled and in awe. a gift like that would say so many things. some of those things are:     1. she knows what my passion is   2. she cared enough to research microphones and to pick one out that is considered good and usable.   3. she somehow knew I need a microphone designed for a kick drum and got the right one.     Let's say she knew I needed it because she took the time to look into what I'm passionate about and realized on her own that I don't have one, but I need a specific style of microphone to record a kick drum.     that, for me, is what makes an amazing gift. being able to know who they are enough to get them something that makes how well you know them surprising.
8qfo3FvYaa	You could give her flowers and chocolate.  It's simple but traditional.  If you want to do something special you could make something for her.  I'm a girl so ik that girls love home made stuff even if it doesn't look very good.  My friend Elaina is making a paper mache heart and filling it with candy for her boyfriend.  If you're not very artistic you could get a necklace that's shaped like a heart cut in half and you both wear half of it. Ik that guys don't wear stuff like that but it would probably mean a lot to her.  Good luck|`|ksdNnJVmaa	teddy bear and chocolate would be nice...  jewlery also.. but not very expensive jewlery. maybe like a necklace that has a heart on it or something. that would be nice =D|`|PkiHXdSBaa	you could make her a card with something lovely inside it like     happy valentines day (insert name)   hope you have a lovely day  i hope we can spend our lives together for now and forever..    love (insert name)    also a picnic would be good|`|FwJLD1uDaa	chocolate is always nice...     or give her a secret love letter :)
NYU37jfGaa	In 'Marie Antoinette', Joan Haslip writes:      'On February 1 1785 the necklace was delivered by Boehmer tot the Hotel de Strasbourg, and the delighted jeweller received the deed of acquisition with each paragraph signed 'Marie Antoinette de France'.  That same evening the Cardinal set out with the necklace for Versailles where Madame de la Motte was staying in a hotel.  He had no sooner handed it over to her than a man arrived whom he recognised to be the Queen's servant whom  he had laready seen that night in the garden, and who was none other than Retaux de Villette. That was the last that was ever seen of the legendary necklace that had brought its creator to the verge of ruin.  Within a few days it had already been broken up, smuggled by Monsier de la Motte to London, and sold piece by piece in the jewel markets of the city.'|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	A very interesting question.

The emphatic form of the pronoun yo is m (with accent). Mi (without accent) means my. Thus:    A m (with accent) me gusta(n).
FyHaU0D6aa	Many (if not most) ergative languages switch the cases depending on whether or not the verb is transitive.    In a nominative-accusative language, the doer (agens) is always in the nominative, while the sufferer (patiens) is in another case, often the accusative.    In an absolutive-ergative language, the agens of an intransitive verb will usually be in the SAME case as the patiens of a transitive verb: the ergative case. The absolutive case is reserved for the agens of a transitive verb.    (Im basing this on Greenlandic, the only ergative language I have any real knowledge about)|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	I (nom.) go to work, and they (nom.) pay me (acc.). (Real English)    Me (abs.) go to work, and they (erg.) pay me (abs.). (Ergative English, morphological, using objective case marking for absolutive)    Morpho-syntactic Ergative English might also look like:    Go me (abs.) to work, and they (erg.) pay me (abs.).    with the intransitive "subject" using both the syntax and case of the transitive object.
nyReGoBhaa	Take the shaikh when you ask for permission. If he refuses than the Shiekh can assign a new Wali.    To be valid, a marriage has to meet certain requirements such as ishhar (announcement), the payment of the mahr (dower), the consent of both parties, the permission of the wali (woman's guardian), and the presence of witnesses.    As far as the consent of guardian is concerned, it can only be dispensed with if the guardian is simply refusing to give consent for considerations other than Islamic, in which case the judge/Imam/Shiekh can authorize the marriage after having followed the due process. If, on the other hand, such is not the case and no attempt was made to ascertain the consent of the guardian, then such a marriage would be considered invalid and, therefore, unacceptable in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "There is no (valid) marriage without a guardian and two reliable witnesses."|`|4aveC2aaaa	lmao@ you speaking about american rights    well sis/bro:    your situation is very sticky and tight :-S    i know exactly, exactly, exactly what you are talking about. not that i have been in that situation about race and all, but my father is one who is EXTREMELY strict and if i ever slept with a guy, he would...well, take business and matters into his own hands. o_O    you should really see whats best from your parents, i know what you are talking about...but still, your parents are a gateway to heaven    best of luck to you    speak to a sheikh for further help|`|0yTM98Odaa	That avatar makes you happy?  why exactly?

If the father has a legitimate reason for objecting, then he must be obeyed and not disobeyed; disobeying him and going against his wishes comes under the heading of disobedience towards parents (uqooq) which is a major sin.   But if the reason for his objection is a worldly or social matter that is contrary to Islam and the aims of shareeah, then there is no sin in going against his wishes, but you should try hard to please him and convince him."  http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/84052/    "Our advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and avoid division, then do so."  http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/1805/    Best Wishes, insha'allah!  and don't forget to do Isthikaara!

AM7CgQ4daa	Louis military excursions can be neatly separated into four distinct conflicts:   1.  the War of Devolution with Spain   When Philip IV of Spain died in 1665, Louis seized the opportunity to invade the Spanish Netherlands (present-day Belgium) and the Franche-Comt (now Burgundy). Both provinces were more French than Spanish. Louis cited his wifes claim to those lands, since she was the daughter of the deceased Spanish king.    2.  the Dutch War  England, agreed to an alliance with France. Louis then confidently invaded the Netherlands on April 29, 1672. The Dutch, however, proved to be tougher opponents than the Spanish had been.  In August 1678, the war finally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Nijmegen.     3.  the War of the Palatinate and the War of the Spanish Successionthe last of which might be called the first truly global conflict of the modern age. In 1686, a coalition, known as the League of Augsburg, began to form against Louis.  It included England, Netherlands, Spain, Savoy, Sweden and the Hapsburg Empire.  Aware of impending war, Louis struck first, invading the Palatinate  By 1697, Louis had had enough and concluded the Treaty of Rijswijk, in which France returned everything she had taken since the Treaty of NijmegenLorraine, Catalonia, Flanders, Luxembourg, the Rhine fortresseswith the exceptions of Strasbourg and the Alsatian territories.    The war of succession  The precarious health of the childless King Charles II of Spain left the succession open to the claims of three principal pretendersLouis XIV, in behalf of his eldest son, a grandson of King Philip IV of Spain through Philip's daughter, Marie Thrse, to whom Louis XIV had been married; the electoral prince of Bavaria, Joseph Ferdinand, a great-grandson of Philip IV; and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, who had married a younger daughter of Philip IV, but claimed the succession in behalf of his son by a second marriage, Archduke Charles  England and Holland, although willing to recognize Philip as king of Spain, were antagonized by France's growing commercial competition. The French commercial threat, the reservation of Philip's right of succession to the French crown (Dec., 1700), and the French occupation of border fortresses between the Dutch and the Spanish Netherlands (Feb., 1701) led to an anti-French alliance among England, Leopold, and the Dutch.  In 1713, France, England, and Holland signed the Peace of Utrecht. Charles VI continued the war, although Eugene had been defeated (1712) at Denain and had been forced to retreat in the Spanish Netherlands. Seriously weakened by the defection of his allies, the emperor finally consented in 1714 to the treaties of Rastatt and of Baden, which complemented the general settlement (see Utrecht, Peace of). With this settlement, the principle of a balance of power took precedence over dynastic or national rights in the negotiation of European affairs.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Wikipedia or google?

An appropriate age for marriage of girls in my opinion is when a girl gets her first menstrual period as she is an adult as soon as she starts her menstrual cycle because her body is able to bear children and give birth. For men I say as soon as they finish high school at least, and can support a family by getting a job.  I don't know how to explain it really, I just felt that Allah(SWT) meant for me and my husband to be together.  I left it up to Allah(SWT) to decide what was good for me.|`|GMJCjMqmaa	I do not think any one should get married to young. I am glad Education is your priority right now. I think a person also needs some time to grow and learn about themselves, who they are, define their identity as a person before marrying another.   I think marrying in your 30's is pretty good. You would still have time to have children, if you desire too, and have lived and been educated too.
s9zC9r9Uaa	Just because its Valentine's day doesn't mean that you have to get him something romantic. My boyfriend and I always get each other something practical or something we know the other wants (not like a cheap bear or something like that).    find out what his likes are and build off of that. for example, I know my boyfriend likes to read a lot so I could get him a book that hes into. I know video games are expensive but if he has an xbox or something like that you can get him a gift card to gamestop so you can help him get that game that he wants.

Luk 13:3  I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.     Luk 13:4  Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?     Luk 13:5  I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.     and     Joh 8:24  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.    and    Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

That would mean that a huge amount of the human population would go to Hell (Dharmic religions, animistic religions, indigenous peoples, Jews...etc).  God loves all of us.     Remember the Bible is just a book.|`|AKFlMCToaa	Friend,    If you want the Truth, here it is:    The teaching that the dead go immediately to a burning Hell, or the saved to Heaven is false.   The Bible records that the dead are dead, and they remain dead until they are resurrected by God.      There is more than one resurrection (Rev. 20:5).  In the final resurrection, the wicked will be burned to ashes and then cease to exist (Mal. 4).    The Jews in question you are talking about are indeed God's chosen people, and He will not let them down.   In Ezek 37, God shows that He will raise them up to a physical resurrection and then He will have mercy on them and allow them to repent.  He says they will have His Holy Spirit because He will give them a new heart of flesh, and remove the one of stone.      Of course, it is for each individual, Jew or Gentile, to answer God's call for repentance.  Those who refuse to repent of their sins will be destroyed in the lake of fire.  They will not be tormented forever and ever.    Read I Cor. 15, the resurrection chapter of the Bible.    Good luck.|`|mMo2hwUBaa	All who reject Jesus die in Sin and are bound for hell.  Those in Abraham's bosom were resurrected at the crucifixion.  But more importantly, they didn't die for the sake of God.  They died because we live in a fallen world.  But, many go through torture of various kinds during life, and it only worsens at death.  The good news of Jesus is that although everyone is deserving of death and hell, because of the sacrifice of Jesus, all who accept Him are saved.  All who reject are not condemned by God, but by their own Sin of rejection of the Love of God, and the obedience of His son Jesus.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Jhn 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.      says it all........|`|AA12059478	They went to Abraham's busom.|`|5xvXOj1Saa	idk|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	The Jews did not die because of God.

In the truest translation of the Bible, if they were able to trust Jesus even after death they go to heaven. If they didn't, they went to hell where God waits for them to discover the truth.

Do you think thats what God would really want, for his people to kill eachother because they believe different? For his people to be intolerant?    I think the concept of heaven and hell is so messed up. What about the good spirited person with a heart of gold that isn't exactly "godly"? Do they deserve to suffer an eternity of misery and pain burning in hell? Something about that just doesn't seem right to me. So matter what the bible says.     And the jews didn't have to die because of God, it was because of Hitler and all the anti-semitism. But thats a whole different story.

Judaism does not have a hell, or what you would view as hell, so to them, if they lived a good honest life to the best of their abilities, they will reach paradise. If not, they do not reach paradise and they start a new life with no memory of a past life. Therefor, with the Jews being God's Chosen people, whom live a good honest life, they went to Heaven.

It is irrational to keep any of these services if these dumb companies aren't thinking about giving a discount or lowering prices and they simply don't care, however you can show them this by changing to another provider and, or disconnect your service as I did, I got rid of may satellite service with Dish Network, after they ripped me off and were charging me for a DVR convertor and a 4th convertor I got sick of it and settled for local channels by installing a regular antenna!  That saved me over 120 dollars a month, DSL changed provider after they increased the charges by over 17.00 dls/ month, cell phone, disconnected one of the 2 and eventually went to another company.   I'm not giving my money away ever any more I don't care if the economy ends up getting better or I become well off, and that is one of the reasons why I don't shop at Target, always Walmart, you really save a lot, Target and any other retailers are rip offs!  Look around Macys having over 7,000 layoffs nationwide, Target itself, many people don't have cell phone service, Cable or satellite, people are seriously struggling these days, just to keep a roof over their head and the very basics.

We don't call them "emo", we call them "posers".    Emo came from a music genre, but apparently is the "new goth". If ya hate life and wanna die, that sounds pretty emo to me. If you like to have a sence of fashion, that just makes you normal.    I don't see why emo's barely just hurt themselves, a real emo would finish the job.|`|Aw9ADXGPaa	Look, Don't listen to what other people say. If you Cut your wrist then your emo. If suicide sounds like paradise or an escape from hell then your EMO other wise your not and screw who ever says other wise.
dCewrtXaaa	Yes. If you are capable of it, try to imagine how you would feel if the same thing had happened to a loved one of yours and the same thoughtless remark had been made.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Although he did not exercise sound judgment, the guy did pay for his stupidity with his life so you should leave well enough alone, hopefully the other students will learn something from this but yes, go ahead and write an apology letter.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	thats terrible! i mean, dont feel TOO bad, but its not polite to make fun of the dead. it was his fault, yes, but that doesnt give you the right to be so cruel. next time, think before you speak.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes and it is wrong to make fun of anyone.|`|YJO1O49faa	i honestly don't think so, you would of said practically the same thing if he was in the hospital or got a just a bruise from the accident. I mean guys at my school were joking around about a guy that died at football practice a couple months ago, they were saying "well the idiot should of said something when he his throat started to close" and "well if he had just not partied the night before and slept in and forgot his inhaler"  i see how people can be upset tho  just watch where you say things like that and who you say it too.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Yes. That was a very insensitive thing to say, especially since the guys girlfriend was in the room.     Don't write an apology letter, that is the cowards way out. Speak to the girlfriend and everyone else you offended. Apologise and say how wrong you were for saying that. Tell her that if she needs support you are always there, even if you don't know each other well.    It must be an extremely traumatic time for the girlfriend and the guys family. You just made it hurt more.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	It's a little bit insensitive, don't you think?  What if your brother, mom, (whoever you care about) died like that and you overheard some random kid saying the thing you said?  I know it'd piss me off...|`|HtZBATJNaa	yeh he will haunt you soon. watch out|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Yes! Completely disrespectful. You didnt think of the other people affected by your comments. We all make mistakes, and this mistake just happened to end his life. It's not fair, but that's what happened. I'm sure you've done really stupid things but you've just lived to tell. Thats so rude of you|`|rUgC7SPsaa	YOu definitely seemed to have been very insensitive to people who may miss him or feel that he died too prematurely.  I would be a big man and apologize...  but really mean it because that probably really hurt someone who loved that guy very much.|`|7DlEN6lXaa	You were extremely cruel. Yes, he made a bad decision but did he deserve to die?  Haven't you ever made a bad decision?  "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."    Now be a man and own up to being an unthinking clod and apologize.|`|N1ot1wpRaa	It's insensitive but you can still do the right thing    Write the apology letter as soon as you can and really mean it :-)|`|WqI4rCrhaa	I dont think so.  He put himself in that situation- so he was a dumb-***.  Write an apology if you're sorry for what you said. Otherwise, you're entitled to your own opinion and no one else can judge the way you feel about the situation.  It's always more socially acceptable to sympathize, but I promise you're not the only person who feels this way.  Don't be shhhh'd and afraid to speak what's on your mind.  Stand behind the things you say b/c you're only as good as your word. :)|`|bBqPja7eaa	It is plain disrespectful and senseless, would you like it if you had been the one and your brother or sister heard it?   yes I think you are absolutely wrong for doing this.|`|ZjmjCpiWaa	Yes.  That was very insensitive.  Perhaps you should rethink that apology letter, and write it like you mean it.|`|TepR1rACaa	No, you just tried to have a sense of humor about something not so funny. You wouldn't believe how many family members crack jokes after a passing. No biggie.     After all your assumptions are correct right?    Perhaps the girlfriend could write one as well since she felt the need to spread private information about her boyfriend?    Joking is part of the denial stage..by the by. It is a coping tool. These people are not ones to state how one person should be allowed to cope and how not too. Just apologize at the most if you feel the need to. But I think them requesting a formal written apology is a bit much.     I just graduted from a mortuary science program and have heard much much worse come from family and friends.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	this is a sensitive matter kids our age don't loose people close to us like friends very often i mean people seen this guy at school every day and is now dead be a little sensitive then again they are also being a little sensitive because if it was the truth then they well have to get over it|`|79cyxGEwaa	You cannot hurt the dead guys feelling's, maybe the live kids can take this as good advice|`|KvOByW8naa	I think writing an apology letter should be up to you, i personally agree with you, i think he's a dumb piece of **** for joining in a street race, and without a seatbelt on?     I would have said the same thing and it wouldn't be anybody else's buisness what was said.|`|rThIVk2maa	Yes, that was insensitive and rude to those who are still mourning his loss. You should write an apology.
1GCLKkpTaa	Hi, Matt..Vedas are thought to be composed by around between 2000 to 1000 BCE by various Rishis. They are more or less concerned with animal sacrifices and rituals. If you see Hinduism today, it does not have even a 10% of Vedism in it. The concepts like Karma, Moksha, Samsara, Ahimsa, reincarnation etc. were not there in Vedas and were incorporated in latter vedantic texts like Upanishads from the Sraman religions. Jainism and Buddhism which are non-vedic are continuation of this Sramana stream that is even more ancient than vedism. Vedas did not have gods like Shiva. Vishnu and Brahma were minor deities and Indra reigned supreme. So Vedas cannot be called perfect texts. Had they been so, then Animal sacrifice would be routine by Brahamans and no one would pary to Krishna and Rama who are non-vedic deities. Ultimately Hinduism has cast away most of the vedic concepts and heavily borrowed from Jainism and Buddhism (Although the Hinduatva vadis and Orthodox establishment swears by Vedas)|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	You don't need a religion calm down.|`|LtLADeNzaa	hindus pray in a mundir  hindus wear sari  hindu cant wear shoes in the mundir|`|zuOPSr5Eaa	you're better off being an athiest honey|`|XEyV0etIaa	You do some research. The bible, google it, yahoo or talk with the people in your neighborhood of different religions
GuBF5xhDaa	Not in the sense that you see in the movies. They are normal people who have a physical need for extra energy because they don't have enough of their own to stay healthy. Sanguines drink small amounts of blood from willing donors, and psychic vampires pull the energy directly from their donors. They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition. They don't sleep in coffins, they aren't immortal, and the worst that they get from the sun is a burn. If you have any questions you can ask me.  http://www.sanguinarius.org/  http://www.drinkdeeplyanddream.com/  http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/  http://vampirewebsite.net/   http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm|`|igI5yX0vaa	No.  They are just an example of something that has abilities some of us wish we had.    That is why Heroes is so popular.    They are not cool to me; just my opinion.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Um...I'll bite. What's the answer?|`|cDz6jxxnaa	vampires are not real(i wish) i love the twilight saga. edward cullen is mine( i sooo wish he was real) so yea they are soooo cool!!|`|h1eBWehMaa	vampire posers are real, and they are far from being cool. i guess they could be cool in their group but to the rest of society... they are lame|`|EFXT4rj2aa	i love vampires lol to bad they aint real. anyway you should read the twilight series there really good but its more on a line of a love storie.|`|QK4r41Hqaa	I have to agree with Twilight killing it :(    I don't think vampires are real, but ever since I was 4 I've wanted to be one XD  I love the idea of them for some reason- and am addicted to reading Vampire stories (but again, twilight killed it)|`|b1sB4fuGaa	They used to be really cool to me until Twilight came along and ruined it.|`|zW67wcRVaa	Never really got into the whole "twilight vampire" thing.|`|MQb4I2w1aa	haha no there not real. and nah i dont think there cool. they just give goth and emo bitches poeple something to obsess over|`|kRamCXlKaa	No offense, but exactly how old are you? Everyone knows they are not real, and pesonally I don't like them...      Don't take it personally.  JJ|`|rVLolY7raa	No, no.|`|xRd6Nxdvaa	i think theyre really cool.  and if anything twilight only made them better!  i mean yeah the movies sucks but the books give so much insight and detail. i mean who would really want to be fang bearing people i think the twilight sega puts a better history and more fun story to them!  DaNiElLe!|`|LPilzLnZaa	ummmm.... ive never really been into scary pale blood sucking guys so no, they're not cool.|`|XfhkQwKIaa	No, they are mythical creatures that murder innocent human beings. How can that be cool? Google "Vlad the Impaler" and you'll understand what a monster these myths come from.|`|CfXKolVUaa	they are interesting 2 read about|`|iLeG9v2xaa	no vampires are not real|`|0PgdLh9Uaa	no they arent real..  i enjoyed the twilight series but i dont really care about them anymoree.|`|gSIGZmq8aa	YESSS!! I vaunt to suck your bludddd!!!!!|`|UplpiqdCaa	i thought they were really cool, until Twilight came along and messed a lot of sh!t up|`|EkmbrFvRaa	They're real to me. Twilight is amazing. Edward Cullen.|`|lzx32Cvcaa	since a long time i have loved vampires i   think they are not real but it doesnt hurt to imagine  i love reading books with them|`|SIUj7uvDaa	i think they could make a cool graphic design decal on a tshirt or something|`|hs5kKoNwaa	i really don't know if they're real. there's definitely a bunch of old tales about them if you search 'vampires' on google. But i guess if they were real, it would be pretty hectic on the world, & there would be a lot of random disappearances of people. if they were real, we'd most likely would've seen them by now. hmmm...in some ways i think vampires are cool, but in other ways, not so much.|`|lWuZR8wBaa	They're not real.  They are only cool if they burst into flames when exposed to sunlight.|`|qIIKyyn8aa	vampires aren't  real, but I love the twilight series I've read all of them. to all you haters: you're just jealous cause you wish you were them.LOSERS!!!!!!only to the haters though.|`|LWdwLlhcaa	It all depends on the reality you accept, if you believe them to be real, then they are. Don't ever let someone tell you or try to get you to think otherwise of something you believe to be true. Even if it is outrageous. But onto the book franchise, the vampire genre has been ruined ever since Anne Rice has been around. If you want a good book series about vampires check out Amelia Atwater Rhodes books. They're amazing. Onto Twilight: No one, NO ONE, should ever be published from fanfiction.net. Plus here's the entire book series in one paragraph to tell how s***** it is: Oh who are you? Oh Edward! You can best be described as a virgin Greek god with all your abilities and looks, oh my that guy is attacking us! Next book: I really like this guy but I like this other guy more! Last book: I can't have sex with you because I'm a virgin but I'm 100 or so years old, but we can if we get married. Done.   It's just another one of those plots to save yourself for marriage with the vampire twist to it, it's completely dumb.|`|egBy7RqOaa	YES vampires are indeed real. how do i know? i am one. i was transformed by my best friend (vampire) on my fourteen birthday. i think the main reason everybody thinks we are fake or lame is because of the stereotypes about vampires let me clear some of the truths up for you guys so that you can see how real we are.    we sleep in beds  we eat real food  we drink real drinks  occasionally drink blood (only donated blood which cannot be of use to a human)  don't have 'special powers'  the difference is that our senses are sharper  we are not immortal-we don't live forever you just can't see us age physically as you would a human.  we don't transform people by biting them, we exchange blood or through sex.   we do not burn in sunlight-we get headaches/migraines      any questions about our existence feel free to email me.    and for all you non-believers, one day we will prove our existence and you will eat your dirty words.     this is why we are more powerful than you, because your minds don't function logically (some human minds) because if they did then you would clearly see the evidence that is put out in front of you.    hope i helped. =]  vote best answer?|`|gztbbl52aa	i believe there was some type of vampire not like twilight or anything like that but i believe all fiction has a fact and if there isn't a type of modern day vampire then there was a type of some sort of vampire.     i also like the old fashion vampires not twilight kind.|`|0JERmAslaa	no they are not real
3rGkm0rDaa	Dude, he loves you. He might even be obsessed.|`|B3Cd58ehaa	No I think he just wants to have another dude to hang around|`|mxu1mzgqaa	i would think so, but then again, he seems so controlling. something that really bothers me. i had someone try to control every part of my life, we were not dating, but he thinks that we are still good. he messed up. i control my own life, i make my own decisions. he may be a controlling type, that you may not be happy with. it is possible that he likes you, but i would not read into it too much. if he says he is straight, then just leave it at that.
dCewrtXaaa	Let the guy go for good. He is no friend.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	That is not a friend by any stretch of the imagination, def let him go. Life is too short to have assholes cluttering up your day.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	you seem to deserve more respect then they have to offer. they are being selfish to you, and should not be reffered to as a "friend" if they cant be sensative to your feelings, and expect you to be. forget 'em!!!|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I have a "friend" just like that.  We used to work together on the same shift and talk every day, she always had some crisis to cry about but when I went through a horrible depression after a miscarriage she had far better things to do and completely blew me off even when I actually asked her to come over and talk.    I say, let this person go.  They are not a real friend.  Just let them be in the outskirts of your life.  He he calls or wants to talk, just treat him like a casual acquaintance and talk to him about trivial things.  These kind of people will never me more than "takers" so just don't put yourself in the position to be hurt by your "friend" again.|`|kKpYQ42oaa	I think before you let him go for good, you should openly communicate to him why it is that you no longer wish to be his friend. A true friend would be understanding and giving in that situation.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	maybe you should wait till they want to cry on his shoulder and say suck it up . then again not a lot of males are open for situations like that .|`|ykIleAQ7aa	I think we've all been there with a person in our lives.   I say let them go they don't sound like a friend at all.|`|rThIVk2maa	Your acquaintance is no friend, so yes, let him go. Friends are people that we can count on for mutual respect and understanding, and this person obviously can't do that, so cut him loose.
aPuUuWlLaa	Well, statistically the UK has a much higher number of atheists and agnostics so I would think that would correlate usually with greater acceptance. I think it was up to 40% and growing in the Uk at the last census.|`|a86de0fc85e991d8d111b09367571df7aa	I would guess the UK, but in my town it isn't that big a deal.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	From what I've heard and talked about with people- the UK is more tolerant and accepting of atheist.|`|AA10696542	UK.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	the uk!|`|AA12257580	Atheists are much more accepted in the United Kingdom (or most of Europe, for that matter).|`|alyr0SB8aa	I'm not exactly sure about the UK, but the US seems to be pretty crazy (my view of opinion) when it comes to religion.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	I'm guessing the UK, there are still too many back water red necks here|`|fAA3rjTbaa	what do u mean more accepted? thier not discriminated agianst anywhere|`|15OwIh91aa	UK|`|FEfUqngJaa	uk|`|eAMq1iBWaa	yes definitely!|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	UK|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	I'm guessing UK, but I don't know|`|1bJ6KV0paa	UK and other places where most people are smarter.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	The UK seems more accepting of all things, not just Atheism.|`|8fp5dSW4aa	I would say the UK, only because Europe has much more religious tolerance than our country, regardless of the religious demographics|`|QictQpZzaa	More or less the same, unless you count the death threats from Muslims in the UK.    Christians in the US act like they're annoyed by it, but that's basically it.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	I'm guessing UK....I've heard of atheists being persecuted in the States, but never in England.|`|a6eb6e311bd16dad988d64e4f060d69faa	UK hands down|`|AA11264399	Almost everyone is an atheist here in the UK.

jIk2ttH1aa	Lack of emotional support.

For me it was lack of emotional support.  BF would not talk to me about his sex drive issues and left me wondering if I had done something wrong.  Just needed someone to communicate with and it was a bad idea to stray.|`|5etQRgqQaa	Every person is different but the main reason people (both men and women) have affairs is because of a lack of emotional support.|`|im9HVuWfaa	You can't choose only one.  Real people don't work that way.  They are complex, and it probably was a combination of both.  The lack of sex/connection could lead to an affair, and it could also lead to a divorce (which is the better option).  I understand that he was probably feeling bad about himself and took it out on her, but there is no excuse for cheating.  She should have offered him support (if she didn't), and he should have sought help rather than hurting his wife.    Lack of sex could cause someone to want to stray, but lack of an emotional connection can kill a marriage.

XJKLel5Jaa	I like these verses: Romans 14:13;1 Cor:8:9;Ezekiel 3:20    Here is how I believe we should act: Colossians 3:5-17    5Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 6Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.[b] 7You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 8But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 11Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.      12Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 14And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.      15Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 16Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. 17And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.    I also thought of a verse that describes the "rules of engagement" so to speak, regarding how we are to approach a brother who is living in sin. Do you know which one I mean? Where we are to go with another believer to confront them, then take them before the congregation if that does not work. While we are not to judge others, we are to admonish one another in love. But not until after we remove the "plank" from within our own eye. I also believe that while certain behaviors of believers might not be a problem for that believer, we are not to be a stumbling block to our brother. If we are then I believe that is a problem. We should be edifying one another. Lifting each other up. Not tearing each other down. And while our sins are forgiven and forgotten if we ask it of our Father, if we truly Love Him the right way, we will desire to please Him, and not give in to temptation and sin further if we can help it. Certainly forgiveness is not a license to sin.    This is from a commentary that I found:    So Jesus offers what became known in the sixteenth century as the "golden rule": Do to others as you would have them do to you. The verse has Old Testament roots (Lev 19:18). In addition, numerous such ethical statements existed in ancient Jewish and Greek culture. Jesus' formulation of the rule, however, is the least self-focused. Jesus is not saying, "Do good deeds for others so they will return the favor." Instead he is calling for actions of love regardless of how the other responds. Nor is he saying, "Think of what you like, then do that for others." Rather, we are to be sensitive to the needs, feelings and concerns of others and seek to meet them. Sensitivity in love means listening and serving. This does not mean ignoring moral limits, as Jesus' own ministry makes clear, but it does mean caring enough to be concerned about how others feel. The old adage "walk a mile in my shoes" may fit here: look at things from another's perspective and then act with concern.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Rom 6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?

WE as Christians have a covenant with God, to follow his commandments and have Faith in HIM, and in the Son of Man, Son of God.    We All sin and will continue being tempted to sinning.  We must strive to avoid temptation to stop sinning.  We do not have the Right (vs. supposed) to judge no one.  ONly God has that Divine Right.  We must imitate JC.  We have the responsibility to guide our brethen when they are walking in the wrong path for that is what JC did.  HOw do we guide them in the right path?  By saying and doing what JC taught us, by doing everything JC said in FAITH.    After all, whoever thinks the way you asked ur question is doomed to continue sinning and breaking up the covenant with God and JC.|`|vvgodUChaa	jesus died for the sins of the whole world back to adam an forward to eterinty,salvation if life and jesus is the only one that laid down his life so he could give you hisl ife and that life he gives is eternal life,he not dealing with us on sin anymore.if you will stay in his word he will lead you into all truth,truth is whats sets us free,and error is what keeps us in bondage,the grace of god is what cause us to say no to unrightiousness,if we are in christ he has given us everting we need for a life in godleness,hope this helps|`|v7Wflu78aa	My guess is that you are about fourteen years old and are struggling with figuring out what is right and wrong, and deciding how you are going to lead your life, and who you are.    I think religion is making this process very difficult for you.  Using religion to sort out your life (as a young teenager) is like trying to bake a cake using pictures from a magazine and crayons, rather than a recipe and the correct ingredients.  No matter how hard you try, no matter how pretty it is, crayons and photos don't make a cake.    I highly recommend you seek the friendship of non-religious, well-behaved people, and find out how to live a righteous, non-religious life.|`|pbT0tJvqaa	Amen!!   We should strive to be perfect.

f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	The best feeling in the world is doing a kind or selfless act with no possibility of reward, or even acknowledgement.    It has a very uplifting feeling to it.    I don't like the idea of just doing good things in order to get into heaven.    How do I know what I'm really like then?  How do I know that all my good deeds are not just selfish acts to keep myself out of hell?    (I'm a spiritual, but non-religious person and don't really believe in heaven, but thought I would answer anyway.)|`|v7Wflu78aa	That makes sense - that being good for the sake of being good shows a stronger character, than a religious person who is good in order to avoid hell.|`|AA11648578	Salvation is not a reward for doing good deeds.

In fact, the Bible specifically tells us that no man can do enough good deeds to earn his way into heaven. Any good deeds that man does of his own accord are worthless in the eyes of God.  (Ephesians 2:8-9)     For that reason mankind will not be judged by the good we do but by the sins we've committed and the price for even one sin is death/hellfire.(Romans 6:23)      That was why Jesus came and paid the price for our sins.(John 3:18)      Our good deeds are the manifestation of the Holy Ghost within us and the only way to receive the Holy Ghost is through acceptance of Jesus Christ as one's savior and repentance of one's sins.(John 14:6 and Acts 4:12)|`|hR1wc0taaa	gosh, if only everyobody was as sophisticated and generaous and smart as you.

8TCiGHKaaa	Arrogant people tend to be boasters and talkers.  The more people talk the more insecure they are.  Insecurity = subconscious fears.  What are they fearful about?  Could be anything, anything at all.    Relaxed, centered experienced people don't need to act that way.  No issues.    Only when there is issues is there a lotta "flack" or "discordance"....|`|qLsTyKVDaa	People may show arrogance to make it seem like they have confidence.They may also use this if they want to seem cooler.On the other hand,they also may show arrogance if they want to hide their insecurity by trying to fool others that they are happy with their so called flaws.|`|AA11199456	I think they're insecure about the fact that they really have nothing to be arrogant about.

Arrogant bullies (or just bullies in general), however, are constantly called insecure. I suppose there are a lot of cases in which that's true.    But in my opinion, there are just as many cases when it's not. There are people who look down on others because they're of a different race or sexuality. And that's not insecurity (not all of the time, anyway).     Like Legend in your own mind! said, sometimes it's just ignorance. Sometimes homophobes and racists are just homophobic and racist, and they're perfectly stable in all other aspects of their lives.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	getting caught making porno movies with prostitutes
TpG33NoWaa	Forgive my temerity in answering, as I haven't done the involved statistical calculations that you must have done.       I wonder what was your definition of a 'nerd' when you were doing your painstaking sociological research.       Is it, perhaps, 'somebody who thinks you are a combative, brash, mean-spirited, smug person' and deigns to socialise with you?        Is it somebody who is obviously more intelligent than you are?       Maybe it is someone who has friends that also find you obnoxious?    The relevance to Religion and Spirituality contained in your profound question escapes me, but your tone, aggression, and apparent anger have not changed -  not that I can tell.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Because they spend more time cultivating their knowledge on the computer or in books than they do working on getting social graces and learning how to relate to others.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Sorry that you see yourself as a nerd, but you shouldn't use that as an excuse to not even try when it comes to social interactions.

It's an interesting label, most commonly used by people wishing to denigrate those more intelligent than themselves. But in the absence of any clear definition, I'll just have to speculate. Regarding whoever it is that you're referring to ... perhaps they are not quite so clueless as you seem to think.  They may just be wiser about how they invest their energies. It may well be that they are simply more discerning in who they engage in social interaction with, and you may not be particularly high up on their list of desirables.|`|yPncyjK1aa	It's because they think more carefully about what to say and the possible reactions, instead of just blurting out the first piece of nonsense that pops into their heads, like so many others do.|`|hyoLpWKJaa	I'll put it simply to ya:    Why in god's name do you care? When I go out and watch idiots leaning against the wall the entire night hating on people that has 2 digit IQ for having luck with women for example, I can't help but laugh.     Take my advice. The more nerds the more women.    There are people you keep around to do your home work, there are people you go to for advice, there are people that are a blast to go out with but are not reliable friends, there are reliable friends, etc, etc, etc.    What you need to understand about life is that you should not complain about the way people are as this will often not change. Instead, use their weakness to your benefit.    Most nerds are tools. They go to school to be tools. They will get a job to be used as tools. They will make money and get an attractive wife that will tool them around, give them almost no sex and take half of their life earnings when they divorce them.    So remember, don't ask why people are the way they are. Find the right people.|`|8z0UZpkoaa	Social interaction with somebody like you might be difficult for an intelligent person.

d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Never had that issue, but they may just want you to make sure this is right. From their actions right now, they may either be just making sure you're ok or they may be trying to "convert" you to straight. (Which you can't do) From what you mentioned though it just seems like they are looking out for you. Think it this way, most trans people when they come out they usually, if they haven't already, start therapy; the therapy is for a few different reasons but mainly to make sure that this is what they want and they aren't confused. There was one person I knew at school that wasn't sure whether she was a he or a she. She'd (because that was what she was born as physically)  been dealing with it for a while and still after months of therapy still wasn't 100% sure. (I think back now it's because the school therapist there wasn't very good)     Not that your parents think its wrong, they just want you to make sure of your feelings. The thing is, if you are already sure, I can only really see therapy reassuring that for you.|`|7sO3tfSIaa	Well I didn't come out until I was an adult, so no.  But I can tell you this.  Even if your parents want you to see a therapist, they cannot control the content of your therapy sessions.  Make the best of it.  Teenage years can be trying times at best, being gay or bi can make it even harder.  Seeing a therapist could provide a safe and neutral environment to talk about your feelings, with no part of it being about "turning you straight."  Just go with it, maybe your parents really do just want to help?|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	it never hurts to talk to someone. In fact you might find it enlightening  best wishes|`|vXREV1Bzaa	They may just think you might want to talk to someone because they understand how difficult and confusing finding out your sexuality may be. I would talk to them about it. Sit them down and ask them if they truly do accept you for who you are.|`|d9zLKgg9aa	no..but they have thought of it...they actually were thinking of taking me to a priest to see if i could be saved from this horrible disease.... xP... i just started laughing lol... ;p|`|Mok3ewI2aa	Nope, I think they need a therapist.|`|PVYBLGFuaa	It took my parents time, but they accepted it.    They probably think they can change you. WRONG. They probably believe in "reparitive therapy" . Also wrong. Therapy or religion cannot change a person's sexuality, it can only suppress their thoughts altogether. The result is MAJOR DAMAGE to the person's pyche.     Your parents are wasting their money, they should just learn to love you for who you are.|`|mxZUt1iMaa	Actually yes. My mom had found out I was going to my school's GSA meetings and wanted to know why. I told her I was bi, and 2 weeks later she sent me to see a therapist. Eventually the therapist herself told my mom there was no need for me to be there in the first place, and that was the end of that.|`|LOSfacl5aa	My parents did not even send me to a therapist when I tried to kill myself.    When I came out they disowned me|`|5NyrFrZpaa	I was over 18 so, as an adult, my parents couldn't have forced me to go to a therapist. Mind you, I grew up in the UK and we find it amusing at how people appear to be obsessed with going to "therapy" - it seems like such an American thing to do.     The view is that therapy is useful if you have some serious problems (e.g. severe depression, maybe going through divorce or a partner just died) but for something like expressing your sexual preferences... well, you should be able to work this out on your own or with your family (which is what they're there for...). But if they won't help you, then maybe counselling can help...     Now, the counselling kind of therapy, that's different. Someone to chat to because you need the moral support, or just to get stuff out, help you sort out your feelings... when nobody else can help, that's useful.    Sounds to me like you aren't that bothered by it and are fairly sorted in your view of your sexuality. Whereas your parents seem to need it so that they can cope with your pronouncement. If you don't think you need it, then tell your parents so. If they keep on about it, go, but agree with them that if that one session shows it's of no use to you then you'd rather they didn't waste their money on something that is pointless (don't try and bargain for an alternative from the money saved - that's tacky).    When you go to the session, be up front with the therapist and explain that you're quite happy with your decision and tell them why. Explain why you understand that your parents are upset and why they think life might be difficult for you as an adult (prejudice and stereotyping, etc.). That should be enough to show that you have approached this maturely and know your own mind.    Best of luck.|`|iGBMtmYXaa	nope not really. my parents kicked me out of the house for a week. it is fine now. the only thing is that i cant close the door of my room when my gf is with me.|`|m0LTkitaaa	I came out a few weeks ago and my dad was nice about it but he asked me if I needed psychological help.

This fierce dog would protect the boundaries of the Land of the Dead to make sure that the dead did not cross to the world of the living and that no living person would cross into the Land of the Dead without dying first.    Nike, as you said - she is the winged Goddess of Victory, so having her as a sports brand is brilliant! Everyone wants Victory to bless them!    Dike - the Goddess of courts and the law system. You can see her wearing a blind-fold and holding the scales of Justice in her hand so that she can make a right decision... the blindfold doesn't mean that she doesn't look at evidence, rather it shows that she does not see people like we do. Dike would not see a person's ethnicity, race or social class when making a decision - unlike what often happens here in the US where poor or minority people are often accused and convicted unfairly.    The Three Fates - there is a lot of talk in movies and television programmes about fate and destiny... these Goddesses make both. Klotho (her name means 'The Spinner') wove the thread of a person's life, Lakhesis, (her name means the 'Apportioner of Destiny') measures the thread of a person's life and Atropos (whose name means 'She who cannot be turned aside') would cut the thread of a person's life, which marked their death.    Herakles - one of the most famous of Greek Heros has a name that now is associated with stregnth, determination and skills.  If there is a big or seeminly impossible job to be done, people will compare it to the adventures of Herakles (whose name means 'Hera's protection is on him').    Narcissus - anytime a person is so selfish that they care only for themself, we call them a Narcissist, after the man Narcissus who was so self-absorbed and warped that he literally starved to death staring at his own reflection in a pool, even when a beautiful goddess was there trying to seduce him.    Owls are a symbol of wisdom, and we often see pictures of them wearing mortar boards (graduation hats) or glasses. This is because the Owl was the companion and symbol of Athena, Goddess of wisdom.    Gaia - this is a name for the Earth that is often used in environmental science and Ecology to describe the entire living ecosystem of the planet Earth. It is the ancient Greek name for the Goddess Earth, and she is considered the Mother of all living beings (he husband was Ouranos, or Father Sky).    The names of Planets, Stars, Constellations, Asteroids, etc - most everything in outer space is named after Greek and Roman Gods, Goddesses, heroes and people from Greek Mythology.|`|10fef0b14524d535c54a941a510b7f6baa	Erm.. I know the Cyclopes was created into that X-men dude (i think he's called cyclopes too?) who can shoot red lasers out of his eye... :)
3ScWB3WDaa	I don't wish, I pray!  And with prayer the things that are meant to come true do.|`|FkYY5SjDaa	Wishes can be prayers and prayers can be wishes. So what was the differance in your initial wish from your later and immediately answered prayer? Do you think that god was not listening?     Once I had to get away from an explosive situation immediately and the person who was just completely out of control stopped in his tracks, got a funny look on his face and went to the paddlocked gate and unlocked it for me. Right before he stopped I felt a huge presence and stopping of time. I now 'know' that divine protection. I know that it will be there for me. I had been praying for at least 6 months straight for guidance and a solution. I just kept hearing in my heart the answer, 'soon'. When the moment came that I needed out right now time stopped, the doors opened and the wish that had floated out of my heart just a few moments before was answered...it was not formal..it was just a cry..(actually a scream)  for 'help'...that moment also answered my prior prayers. It was later and it was immediate.    My prayers are always answered...in the perfect time.    How about you?|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	No can't say as I have.  Seems like I been prayin' hard, for everything all my life!   God does answer prayer...   God is oh, so good!    He never fails us!  :D|`|bYqWHuzyaa	Nope.  I still love God though.|`|AA12059478	God isn't Santa Claus.  He doesn't give things to you simply because you want them.  There's a lot more to spirituality, whether it be Abrahamic, Buddhist, Wiccan etc then just praying for gimmies.|`|BgzVBclBaa	no, it didnt come true immediately, but it did come true, & now i'm talkin bout a thing that i wanted very much ..|`|FmazIF6Maa	Yep... praise the Goddess for all Her wonderful blessings.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Yes, it did happen to me.  However, when you pray God and ask for something, don't believe he will always give you what you want, he will give you what is best for you.|`|6yD5k9Azaa	nope. when i use to have a slight hope that god was real and answered prayers i never ever had him answer one.   another reason i'm agnostic.|`|TNbhUSAIaa	I don't ever wish for something.  I ask God to put in my mind the thoughts that he would want me to have.  I also choose not to want things he wouldn't want me to...When I do pray for things, I don't do it on selfish motivation at all.     The questions really vague....When I pray for guidance, it's always given.  When I ask for help, it's given--a lot of the time in ways that I didn't know possible.    Even though God does say no frequently, I know that he is in control, and I don't worry when things don't go the way I planned.  I know that it will work out in the end...|`|q5lreoiWaa	No The God of my understanding does not work like that - instead though prayer my Heavenly Father gives me the strength to bear what I have to, and He provides what I need, not necessarily what I want.
jIk2ttH1aa	The kids a jerk and the teachers should have reprimanded him not just tried to stifle a laugh.  I can't believe any teacher would think that calling you a freak and treating your and your personal property with such disrespect is funny.    I think you should talk to the principal about the student and the staff and I think you should say that you were under the impression that school had zero tolerance for bullying.  If so, why was this allowed.  You don't even have to say what you were writing because that is not relevant.    Oh, and no, what you were writing about was not "weird" it is a romantic creative mind.    What's wrong with that? NOTHING!|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Sounds normal to me would love to have you post some of your stories here|`|TLOgBy3caa	Nah. I'm an avid shoujo-ai writer :]  I also write poems for girls I like, I even had enough courage to give a poem to a girl I liked last year.  If you're weird, then so am I.  (no, you're not weird)|`|7wqIJbPjaa	nahh it'd be like a straight girl writing love stories about a boy.     they just don't get the LGBT thing. maybe they should come chill at  Y!A and learn a thing or two :]     ps: i think its kinda cute :p|`|Hf73hMI9aa	I personally don't find gay stories or whatever weird. It's just that people are so prejudiced against gays. There's nothing wrong with being gay, lesbian, bi, or transgendered and there's definitely nothing wrong with writing it. As long as the story doesn't get too mature...|`|DIj072Sqaa	No, it just sounds as if he's immature.|`|ur4Eje3Paa	Nope!!  I write Callica fanfiction, so you're not the only one!|`|m0LTkitaaa	I don't think so I write gay stories to.
4WqvTAfmaa	Yes, I know one, but she is currently going through one of the medium's worst nightmares: she is not proofing the spirits that come to her, and has misidentified at least one that I know of. She is spiraling down into negative living and does not recognize it. She also is self centered enough that no one can point out anything to her. We have to wait and see if she pulls herself out of it.    Many mediums etc have problems with alcohol and drugs. It sort of goes with the territory. Part of the reason is that spirits usually don't need to sleep, and want to keep on talking.     For sanity sake, you may want to consider setting some boundaries. Any that you talk to on a regular basis, establish ground rules: don't wake you up, not when you are driving a car, things like that. Astral boundaries are important too. Its fine to talk to everyone you meet, but not ok to let them inside your head and heart. A good source for this is PSYCHIC SELF DEFENSE AND WELL BEING, Denning & Phillips. It is sane, good, and has lots of stuff that works well.    I wish you a wonderful life, Cherish this wonderful gift, it may seem like a curse at times, but it really is a gift.|`|zY6WXobEaa	yes-I can but I cant see them from other "worlds". I only see spirits. They aren't scary or even mean they look more..........lonely. maybe we could help each other out with a few things.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	No I don't - and neither do you.    You may sincerely believe in what you do, but I challenge you to prove it in any way.|`|dFBccLExaa	One of my friends has that ability. She's really quite good at it, and when she was first tapping into it, it was a little odd- watching her go in and out of it. She's also able to access the planes through astral projection, so that's cool too.   Not sure what to elaborate on, she does it, and sometimes it messes with our daily routine, but overall, she works with what she's got lol.|`|QGRZUMj8aa	Sorry hun but I don't know of any such channellers/mediums.    Although I do know that their world is parallel to ours. It's just a gift that God has bestowed on you - for what reason, I'm not sure. All I know is that anyone with such a gift should not be afraid of it but should embrace it. I think most of us that do not have such a gift are afraid as it's something strange to us and we're afraid (maybe due to the way Hollywood has always portrayed such things).
6Whz1p5Eaa	Yes, this old man named Wilbur that I knew back in West Virginia died and I feel very sad because I wanted to ask him something, and I went to google to look up his address so I could send him a letter, and his obituary came up :-(    I know he's in Heaven though.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Put a shirt on girl it's winter!|`|A01w1dHqaa	We are not our bodies. We are mind.   When the body has lost its usefulness as a tool for learning and communicating, it passes on. You can't go by looking at the body, you must know the person's purpose.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Suicide is a coward's way out!    I would be ashamed of any of my family if they opted to take this path. Death and pain are nothing to fear, nothing to dread. If we can't have the balls to go through it, then how can we expect anyone to believe a word we say about God's love for mankind?    All suffer, all go through pain, why should we, (Christians) be exempt?|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	A dear friend just died two weeks ago and she was 77.  I feel a sadness because I will not get to see her for some time and will miss her but am happy that she is no longer suffering nor became a burden to anyone (she would not have liked that.)  Sadness is natural and yes even a bit selfish because it is about us.  If one of my children were to die I would be very sad because of all the joy I will miss and yes glad that they never had to go through some of the  tough times or rebel.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Trusting in God does give us reason not to mourn the loss of a loved one. We are not to stop living, but mourn for a time and then get back to our lives. I hate the thought of losing an unsaved member of the family, I would probably mourn them longer, because I will possibly never seen them again at ALL.     Thou shalt not kill. If the person wants to die then they can elect that they don't want to eat and drink, take morphine and die if this is the case. My baby mother had brain damage and before she got critically ill, which is intended,m she told them if she went brain dead Not to use the life support system.    Nothing else to be said. She was saved, rest in peace until we meet again.|`|h1eBWehMaa	we are sad because they are not here with us, but at the same time we will be reunited someday in heaven and that is peaceful|`|ttCkz39aaa	good question  iam agnostic so cant really answer that|`|HRvPoQzKaa	niceboobs.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Yes, on all counts.|`|8OeulLkmaa	A death of a loved one is bitter sweet.  You know where they are if they are saved but you are still sad because we are seperated.    I support people who are sick or dying and do not want to be put on life support and have given DNR orders.  I would want it to be a painless journey but I would never "euthanize" someone.  Give them pain medicine? Yes.|`|ghHD4afhaa	die chriatians die for Halo!!1|`|8rbQBaIeaa	I  couldn't answer that until I was to be fronted with it. It sounds good in writing, but my mom has Parkinson's, my dad as heart trouble...they are having issues...I want them here...not gone...even knowing that mom is in so much pain. She is going to Heaven I know that...but God can wait a while longer for her, because I don't want her to go. Selfish...sure...am I serious....yes|`|OZAxA6J5aa	I was sad when a family member died. I know he went to Heaven. But I still miss him. Even though I know I'll see him again some day, it still hurts. I mourned his death, but I mourned with hope because he is in Heaven and we will be together again someday.  (So really, I'm more grieving my loss of his company, which is sort-of selfish.)   I'm not sure I support euthanasia though. It seems, odd. I'd much rather let the person die in God's time instead of ours, even if that means for pain and suffering for us.|`|A9EydXySaa	well, idk.  i wouldnt be happy that they died no.  who says heaven is a better place anyway?  no one has come back and said so.|`|PoxcQk5Gaa	I would still feel sadness even though I knew they were in heaven simply because I would miss them and would feel emotional loss.    Admission to heaven or hell isn't predicated necessarily upon suicide.  It depends solely upon whether one has accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and savior whereby your sins are forgiven and you're made acceptable to God.    I am not in support of Euthanasia because it puts the elderly in grave danger.  Those who are really pushing this have an agenda void of the nobility of ending one's suffering.  Its agenda is similar to abortion: taking life for purposed of convenience and easing the burdens people have come to believe the elderly really are.|`|kdo6qnS9aa	God gives life and He is the only one with the right to take it away.
SygvUa0Eaa	First of all... No one can answer and be certain whether or not Adam (and/or Eve) existed. So there's really no point in asking.    Now, if you don't believe he did exist, then you're pretty much left to assume that Jesus was a psychotic man who wished for people to worship him, even after death because as a child he was molested and tortured beyond belief. =D Otherwise... What really can you gather besides the fact that he was insane?    However, in my opinion, who says crazy can't be smart too? I mean, if you really think about it... His mere claims cause wars 2000 years later. It takes quite the scholar to cause such havoc 2 milleniums later, eh?|`|AA10988107	1Cor.15:22-28,51-53, As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

Exodus is right next to Genesis and has the Ten Commandments and parting of the red sea, those are like 2 of the main Bible stories, as are Noah and the Ark, Sodom and Gommorah, etc. and w/out the Ten Commandments, that's like that and Jesus are like the root of Christianity. Real.|`|AA10556726	Well, there is nothing to confirm that Jesus existed, much less that he was anything different than the other messianic figures of his time.|`|dl97DmmYaa	Then he's real.|`|v7Wflu78aa	While the story of Adam is myth, it's useful to know because it is one of the better known creation myths used in literature, art, and popular culture.    Part of growing up in a country or society is learning the myths - both religious and non-religious.    It is often easier to learn a myth if one pretends it's true, rather than as an observer, watching what other people say about the myth.|`|pbT0tJvqaa	Adam was real.    In Matthew 3:23 - 38 It gives the genealogy from Jesus back to Adam.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	It's a matter of faith and you can choose to believe it or not, it's up to you.

There are places in the Genesis that still exist today, but I won't persuade you to believe in the Word of God, only you must do that.    The Cruxifiction is not Fiction as you put it.  But if you think JC is fictional, then what is the point of discussing Adam?|`|TneDU9R3aa	The story is an allegory; probably constructed to teach and unlikely based upon any historical event.    Jesus was crucified because he refused to worship Caesar: Jesus was making a stand, refusing to give up practicing his values even if it meant death.|`|Csi5Vjb0aa	No he's real. Jesus died for every one's sins not Adam's.

They were great spiritual protectors, and they protected the home. Not to mention they got rid of the local pests. They believed this so much that they have a deity based off of it- Bast, or Bastet. They were super big on protecting what they had, so they went out of their way to make sure that they kept Bast and her kitties happy.|`|bR6mKXDqaa	They thought it was funny I guess....|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I think a better question is: Why don't we?  Actually, I don't know why they did. I know that there is a cat goddess (Bast or Bastet) who looks after kittehs and children or something like that.|`|FVLgdXoUaa	Kind of complicated, but I tend to think that it's because cats were probably domesticated for religious reasons in the first place.  The wild animals that were bred down into today's cats were very hard to domesticate, and the people who did breed them were taking a big risk with nothing practical in return.  Some anthropologists think that some people living in Africa probably revered large wild cats enough to actually raise them.  It's reasonable to think that belief might have carried down to some of history's earliest recorded societies.|`|AA10852244	What the heck is a revere kittehs?|`|555adb4fb8480541b78851e79f127a7daa	cats have always been sacred to the Egyptians because they killed the rats that threatened their wheat and barley crops.|`|nN3mHJVhaa	Well, kittehs are to be revered.

If he said yes, then I would gladly lead him in the sinner's prayer. If he said no, I would respect his wishes and do all I could to make him as comfortable as possible.    Also, it goes without saying,I would be praying with all my hear the whole time this was going on.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes, they would teach the boy lies.    "Believe what I tell you to believe.

If there is an age when people are responsible for their sins then it stand to reason that  individuals under that age are guiltless and heaven bound.  This age may vary but it is probably after birth.  Hence one who aborted babies before they were born would be rendering them to their eternal reward  prior to the age of accountability and guaranteeing them eternal salvation.

Well, you see the nice thing about the bible and I won't give you quotes, but Old Testament gave a lot of prophetical reference to the Messiah which is Jesus Christ or Immanuel. Anyways.. to make the long story short, mathematically speaking the odds of 1 of these prophetical events coming to pass is like 1 in a few hundred million. The thing with the bible is that it gives over a few hundred of these prophetical events to come to pass, and well if you do the math.. it is mind boggleing.. Hey did you know for example Israel became a nation again on May 14th 1948.. Guess, what (God) or book said this would happen ?? That's right.. the bible.. it's God's authority.. and our creator and God is wonderful..    don't you think so ?? Now the rest is up to you..Know Jesus and Know Heaven or No Jesus and No Heaven... ??? To me if there is a God and this is His word.. common sense tells me I better listen.. anyways..

So, if they are all different, yet, all claim to be the one and only true church embrasing all universal truth, Than Only 1 can be the one true church, which really does embrase all truth, Or they are all wrong.  And no church does.    It was this very question that was on the mind of a young boy in the year 1820 in A little town called Palmyra New york.  There was great religeous excitement in his hometown.  Different church's were fighting very hard against each other, each telling the other that they were wrong.  The lutherines were opposed to the baptists, and the catholic's against the quakers, and so on and so forth, and there was a general  religeous fight in his home town,  In fact it got so bad, that on one corner, in town, there was an intersection where there were 4 different church's on all 4 sides of the   the intersection.  Each claiming to be the one true church,  Those 4 church's are still there today.    A Young Boy Named Joseph Smith, who lived in palmyra was looking around at all the chaos that the arguements of these church's caused.  And began to wonder, He asked in his own heart and mind, if they are all different, yet each one claims to be the one true church, which one is it, and how will I know.    And he was reading a passage in the bible one day that said if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of god, who giveth to all men liberally.    He concluded that if god gave wisdom to them who ask, perhaps he could pray, and find out for his self which church was true.  So, that's what he did, it was a spring day in the year 1820, he went into the woods to pray, In answer to his prayer, he Saw 2 bright people standing above him in the air, One was God the Father, the other was Jesus christ.  They told Joseph Smith, that none of the church's of the day were right, and that they would restore the one true church through Joseph smith.    That church today is the one true church in all the world.  Having all truth and  God Given authority.  And this church is the only one that has the true pathway back to god.  and it has god himself at it's head.    There is no way to get back to heaven but by the authority possessed within it's ranks.  And it's docterines encompas all truth.  The name of that church is the church of jesus christ of latter day saints.|`|AA10696542	I do not know. I've seen what people say about Islam, some strong arguments.

And since people have different ideas about what the Universal Truth is, we have different religions.   But I think of my "Christianity" as a way of life, not a religion. (Because most churches I've gone to are very dumb and most "religious" people I'm met don't have a clue.) I'm even wary of calling myself Christian since there are so many people who call themselves that, and they can't all be since they all believe such different things. (It's like calling all the reptiles lizards!!)|`|VDTTzwlUaa	If you ask for no religious scriptures then you are basically asking for a philosophical proof of God and his attributes, something that isn't definite.    In many religions prophecy or other knowledge that couldn't have been known at the time is the HUGE proof they use; study of philosophy and jurisprudence also help.    examples with the Abrahamic religions: Jews claim that God revealed himself to their entire nation (the Exodus I guess) and sent prophets that gave them signs and accurately predicted the the events of the future.    Christians revere the Hebrew Scriptures as holy as well so they also believe the signs and prophecies in the Old Testament. However, they also have what they believe to be prophecies that allude to the coming of Jesus, his life and his death. They also claim that Jesus predicted the fall of the temple in Jerusalem accurately.       Muslims claim that some of the prophecies of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures apply to them but not all (as far as I know; this could be a matter of debate between different sects or individuals for all I know). The Muslims claim that Mohammed correctly predicted the victory of the Byzantine empire over the Persians, as well as the invasion of the Mongols.    Aside from being taught a specific religion from birth or having a spiritual/emotional experience these are some of the biggest reasons why people believe in these religions (especially if they have had doubts about the divinity of their religion). If people could without a doubt refute all the alleged prophecies I don't feel like the religions would be nearly as credible.    About the prophecy regarding the nation of Israel: this doesn't seem to be one of the best ones because it was a bunch of world leaders that decided to give the Jews a nation, and they were most likely (if not definitely) influenced by the Bible having said it will happen; it was a British mandate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel Inde... Also, the nation of Israel today does not resemble the nation of Israel as it was in the Bible; many of the Jews are secular Jews.|`|v71arPUDaa	Because I prayed and He answered. and boy did He answer|`|4DbjZlAdaa	not me|`|p7r2Ageuaa	because when im taught my religion i always feel a warmness inside and i can feel that its right!!! im able to keep my attention span for three hours and im only 12!!! every one there is always so happy and when we talk about our religion we are all quiet and respectful !!! even kids 5 and under are!!!|`|ffd293aab0fb04b2c3f99065cb53c6b8aa	I don't think there is one universal truth in religion. everybody believes something different. who are we to judge what others believe.

AyEkA6Flaa	First, you don't need to be scared, confused or worried about your sexual orientation, because you are still an awesome young man no matter who you fall in love with.    And I've lived as married to a woman and with kids -- and now that I no longer deny my feelings I live as a gay guy, single and waiting to find a boyfriend.    I was happy most of the time before, and I'm certainly happy now.    What did get me down before was that I was constantly lying to myself, thinking that I "had" to be straight and that God would not love me if I were gay.  I spent years stuffing down my true affections.  I also prayed, fasted, bound temptation, everything.  Eventually I fell into clinical depression, and meanwhile my wife divorced me!  I thought my world had ended.    But it did not end.  My life continued.  I came to grips with the fact that I like males.  I also found the Gay Christian Network and found some really great gay guys to be friends with.  I'm now very happy, confident, and know God loves me as I am.    Anyway, if you are bisexual, it would not be the end of the world.  You can live a great life if you fall in love with a girl.  And you can live a great life also if you fall in love with a guy.  Just make sure you only get involved with someone who is a quality human being -- trustworthy, gracious, kind, good and faithful, strong and true.  Someone like you.    No matter whom you fall in love with, whether you are gay, bi or straight, you are an incredible human being.  Love yourself for the miracle you are.    Email me if you'd like.    Hugs!|`|Vu726Q18aa	bi-curious|`|CDft5bscaa	What gender(s) are you getting erections for?

e08zWhUjaa	well first of all the relationship you have with your dad sounds great... my dad never said i love you ever...  He does now but i guess that's how old age affects you.. he says it all the time now when i talk with him on the phone...  but to tell you the truth I am probably closer to your dads age... so it really was a different generation.  I have a son who is 14...and a daughter 12 and my relationship with them is way different then the relationship i had with my parents...  i mean my son gets home and come over and give me a hug.  I tell both of them i love them on a regular basis... actually I am on the verge of soon coming out to my son.. which is terrifying to me... HELL its not fair to hav to come out to your parents, friends AND kids..LOL...    Deal is.. your Dad loves you I am sure... and things may take him a bit to come to terms with but that love will always be there... and in a short time i am sure things will be back to usual.. just give him some time to deal with it and wrap his mind around it.... I would make sure you tell him that you are the same son he has loved for years and that his love and acceptance means the world to you.. believe me no dad can walk away from those words... and hell you got my eyes watering now...   well best of luck...|`|ZzYy2szvaa	Heya Jordy.    My relationship with my father is great.  It's his birthday tomorrow in fact and I bought him a HA-YUUUUUGE chocolate and got him a nice card.  He always says he loves me and he's very proud of me.    My father knows I'm gay.  He has told me that it's a little hard to understand, but he still loves me the same.  His sister (my aunt) is a lesbian, and my dad and her were best friends when they were younger, so he grew up with it.  He's taken it very well (unbelievably it was mom who took a little while to get used to it.  She was 100% ok with after about a month).    Tell your dad at your own pace.  If there's no reason to tell him now, and you feel like you're not about to explode, then maybe you should rather hold it in a bit more, but I seriously doubt he will have a problem with it - he sounds like an awesome dad to me! =)|`|3aEQqoM8aa	ya, my dads like yours hes very cool with me and my friends|`|AA12005401	My father molested me when I was a child.  My husband's father is great!  He did not like his son being gay, but after a 2 years of us being together, he is coming around.  He asks me how I am doing when he calls my husband.      Honestly, I think all parents already know.  Just tell him and let him come into your life at his own pace.  He will be fine. :-)|`|ypVrHE1iaa	Well.. When I was four years old a drunk driver hit my dad  head on and he died instantly... But my mom said he was an amazing person.. I wish I could have known him better... I think that if your dad loves you he will love you no matter what! :D|`|JXH9vbs8aa	really interesting question jordy :p  Goes along with the people who think that you become gay partly due to an absence of a father or something like that...    mine is ok.  not bad or anything but not close, and we don't really talk|`|0JmTIcy0aa	I hate my dad so much, but he thinks we get along well.  I'm just using his money right now for school and stuff.  He's those type of beer belly man.  So yeah.|`|u7x0LLR5aa	gotta admit, Jordy...sometimes you ask GREAT questions!  Great responses from everyone.  Totally fascinating to read.  I tend to think Dad's get the short end of the stick in many case in how their children feel about them.    they tend to be home less with the kids, and they also tend to be less communicative which I think leads to distance and the perception of not caring.  When, in most cases it could not be further from the truth.    My dad however...hated him.  lol.  Mom and him divorced when I was 2 or something like that, so the only memory I have of him is me and my sis having to go spend summers with him from like when I was 5-10 or something like that..  OMG....I hated it so much.  I was a sensitive kid, and my dad was not sensitive.  He also drank too much and always would rail on about how awful my mom was.  I hated that so much.    One summer when he showed up to pick us up, I finally rebelled.  I ran into my closet and refused to come out.  lol.  I said I would not go with him.  And my mom and dad knew I was dead serious.  So, he left without me.  Can't remember if my sis went with him.  If she did, now I feel bad for leaving her!  But, that was the last summer I ever spent with him.      A few talks over the years on the phone and then when i was finally starting to accept who I was, I wrote him a letter.  It was a brutally honest letter about how I felt, my fears of him and my feelings towards him.      One thing I wrote in the letter....something that happened that I never forgot....him, my sister, and me (I was prolly 7-8?) were out on his boat and something happened, and I started crying.  My dad for whatever reason got very angry and flustered about my crying and came up into my face and yelled, "what, are you going to grow up to be a f.a.g.g.o.t!?"  That always stuck with me.  I didn't even know what i meant, but I knew it hurt by the way he said it.    And that's how I finished my letter to him with that story.  And I concluded with...."Yes, Dad, I grew up to be a f.a.g.g.o.t."  I heard from him a couple years later (really bugged me he never reacted to the letter).  All he could say was that was all lies planted in my head by my mom.  Till the end, he was "dear ol dad".  lol.    Over the years though, I learned to forgive him and realize he did as good a job as he was able to.  Then I found out in 2005 he had died...a full year earlier!  It was a very surreal feeling.  My dad was dead.  I didn't cry.  I wish I could have though.|`|C2sCmdmzaa	Seeing how my father is also my older brother, I'd have to say we get along great. = )|`|r6fGmJK1aa	We are friendly but not close at all.      He has called me irresponsible on several occasions. When my sister-in-law died and we were all in the room, he was the closest to me, and would not give me a hug, but he did everyone else.     I have no hard feelings towards him, but we will never be close.     I know when he finds out I am gay, he will try to give me all kinds of lectures, and will cut off all contact with me.      So no he does not say I love you. I do not ever remember him saying that to me or any of us kids.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	I don't have a good relationship with mine.    he's an asshole    no, and that wasn't weird it made sense|`|2gyJUTzRaa	i have a bad relationship with my father.  he's an alcoholic and an asshole.  no, he doesn't say "i love you" though i'm sure deep down he does.|`|JegrP4rQaa	I have no relationship with mine.   Sure, he is there, he just isnt talkative.    Like the rest of my family, he is far from affectionate.   He allows me to do whatever as long as he knows where I will be.|`|ErN3pbTeaa	My parents got divorced when I was like 1 and a half. So I was always split between them custody-wise.   He was a decent father for the most part, until he left St. Louis when I was 7. Then I wouldn't see him more than 2 or 3 times a year.      He's a big guy (as in wide :)), very passionate, great motivator, risk taker, money man, and touchy-feely/playful. He always wanted the best for me and for me to be the best. I was his favorite, and he fought really hard to have me, but I was still a momma's boy.     He said I love you every time he was leaving or I was leaving. So I hated those words from him, because that's when it would turn into those movie-scene like departures when everyone cries.... But anyways he is and was very emotional. God! Just thinking about all the times he left me makes me cry...    I feel really bad because I lived with him for 3 years in MN, and then I decided I had to come back to STL (to be out and happy). So I just packed up and left. I hated his wife and my step brothers...But anyways..he is a great guy and I miss him a lot.     We don't talk at all now except for an occasional email.  And I don't plan on ever coming out to him. Good Luck to you though!|`|YwDbuXOWaa	Well my answer is a bit late hahaha    well for my dad i can't stand him i haven't seen him in almost 8 years.   and my step dad we get along very well i consider him to me my dad, i have taken his last name (when my mother re-married).    We have our ups and downs but over all he is one of the best people that i know, he takes care of my family as well as his kids (to another marriage).  And he treats me no differently then his own kids. (between you and me.. i am the favourite though. hahahah Shhhh its a secret )|`|JHDbuNxpaa	Didn't have one|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	he died when i was 1, i never knew him|`|PVYBLGFuaa	He's a good guy, can't thank him enough for accepting the fact i don't like girls like he wanted me to.|`|ltYtxmjEaa	um... i dunno.. we don't get along all too great. i guess about average.. i do get along with my mom better. but even with her we don't get along very well. normally im quiet around my family. and he does say i love you sometimes. he is actually kinda feminem. not flambouantly but a little bit. but  mostly he tries to be a manly man.... i dunno... interesting though..|`|RkjKDh6yaa	My father isn't bad, but I've never been close to him. We have almost nothing in common and I don't see him as much as I see my mom. My mom and I are like friends, though.    I am out to my family and he has no problem with my being gay. But he's been a jerk to me in the past. I guess I never really got over it.     I remember posting a question if this caused me to be gay or at least contributed to it. I have no idea. I sure hope your father doesn't change after finding out you're gay.
74fe5c642d059f46a34e9d235a375172aa	I am the one who proposed my husband.   He worked in the same building with me, and I know he's a devout Muslim but he's so quiet. Even I am not sure he knew me.   I think I love him, so I asked him if he's interested to marry me.  He met my family and then took istikharah prayer, and fortunately he accepted me.   I can't explain how did it feel when I was waiting his answer, it was mixed between worried, but happy coz I've told the man that I like.  And Alhamdulillah, I didn't make wrong decision, coz he's the best man I ever meet    ouuppss.. forgot to tell  before I meet the man that now become my husband, there was 2 men came and proposed me.   It wasn't a nice feeling coz I know I'm gonna refuse them.  the first man, I dislike coz he's so wealthy and proud about his wealthy, a bit arogant. He thought I will be interested to him coz he's rich. He was totally wrong.  The second man, I can't accept because he doesn't know anything about Islam.  It was my dream to get a man who can be my imam, and pious enough to lead me to the way of Allah.   So when I was proposed by men who aren't in my criteria, I felt very uncomfort and a bit confused about what is the best manner to refuse them.|`|Izn1ye9Raa	My husband didn't propose to me.  We met on http://www.qiran.com and after talking for a few days he asked me if I wanted to come live with him in the town he was living in, and I said yes.

This may shock you but everyone hears things everyday that offends them. Everyone feels uncomfortable sometimes. Confront your problems, don't go running to mommy and daddy. (or whatever authority figure is around)|`|svpcp8jLaa	Well, if you don't like confrontation, I suggest telling your manager that you feel uncomfortable. Don't tell him that you feel like they're "perverts" but kind of hint him towards you feeling uneasy with their compliments and glances. If you report this to human resources, they'll consider it sexual harassment, because it is but if you're feeling generous, that's the last thing you want to do because a lot of people will get into well.. trouble.     If you don't mind confrontation, lie. I know it sounds stupid, but it's the fastest way to get them to stop. Buy a huge obnoxious (fake) obviously diamond ring, or just a simple mock wedding, or engagement band. An obnoxious one works better because when they glance at you, say hello, or cat call just smile politely and say, "Sorry, I appreciate the compliments but I'm married." Or you can end with a ".. but my husband doesn't."     Boyfriends are excusable in a man's eyes. A man will hit on you with a lot more ease if you say "Sorry, I have a boyfriend" rather than, "Sorry, I have a husband."|`|Gge69PK0aa	Immature males are afraid of attractive women.

I had a contact on my previous account who due to her very beautiful voluptuous figure always had to deal with guys being ****** around her and being disrespectful. what youre dealing with is nothing at all compared to what she had(more like has) to deal with on a daily basis.    you can also use this to your advantage. if they really like you that much see if you can get a free meal from the kitchen. or mess with them. since you already have their attention just play mind games with them and have fun with it. thats why the way I look at it is that if somebody is obsessed with you, show them all the bad things about you so that they no longer want to be around you.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Anything that makes you feel uncomfortable in your work place can be reported.  Tell them to knock it off or you can have the manager tell them for you.  If they know you are going to report them it should stop.  Don't just let it go on without saying anything or they'll think you like it in some weird way|`|2D1uxlUfaa	talk to your employer that your colleagues are making you uncomfortable.|`|rThIVk2maa	Then report them to HR.

Just like any other intoxicant, though, its use could become a sin if it is overused.  Also, there are some verses in the Bible which suggest that committing a crime is a sin, although in the context, these could be telling Christians to stand by the laws of the Romans, so that their government wouldn't be able to find a new reason to persecute them.  As with anything in the Bible, I think that it is best if you read it on your own and interpret it in context.  As someone else has posted, it is located in 1st Peter, 2:13-2:16.  It might be a good idea to read what the text around it, too, in case there could be some indicator of its meaning there.|`|qKSn0AVsaa	No.... not out right. BUT, it does say to look after our bodies and to not defile them. (2 Corinthians 7:1)     It can effect others around you. The Bible also says: "You must love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22:39) Love for your neighborsand your family members are your closest neighborsis a powerful reason to not smoke it.      A number of countries are considering legalizing marijuana, mainly for medicinal use. The drug has been found to alleviate the nausea caused by chemotherapy, and it evidently helps AIDS sufferers to overcome loss of appetite. It has also been used as a pain reliever.    While there is disagreement about the results of research findings, tests that were reported on in New Scientist magazine have established some of the harmful effects of marijuana.    A Harvard University test compared a group who smoked marijuana daily with a group who used it less often. They found little difference on standard mental tests. However, on one test dealing with adaptability, the heavy marijuana users scored much lower.    Another university tested a group of regular marijuana smokers and a group of cigarette smokers, over a period of 15 years. The marijuana smokers usually had three or four joints a day, while the cigarette smokers had 20 or more cigarettes a day. Equal numbers from both groups suffered from coughing and bronchitis. Examination of the lungs revealed similar cell damage in both groups.    Although the marijuana smokers indulged much less often, it was found that a single joint releases three times as much tar as a cigarette. Furthermore, New Scientist reported: "Marijuana smokers inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer."    In addition, immune cells from the lungs of the marijuana smokers were found to be 35 percent less capable of fighting bacteria than were cells from the cigarette smokers.    The Bible is beneficial for our health. It is full of wisdom. If the Bible says to look after ourselves and keep ourselves clean.... do you still think as a christian it is ok to smoke it?|`|AA11232725	No, the Bible doesn't mention marijuana. If a doctor legally prescribed marijuana for a medical condition then a Christian could use it that way with a clear conscience.    The Bible does however say this about obeying laws and the will of God.    1 Peter 2:13  Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme,  14  or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good.  15  For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men  16  as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God.    A Christian who buys and uses illegal drugs is going against God's will for their witness to unbelievers.|`|E9chZY74aa	Be sober minded.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	nope...

I am racist but i am racist to every race including miens..i wont hate on whites just because or mexicans just because.    and logically goto youtube.com and type in serial killers and watch a VIDEO of them..99.9 of them are all WHITE. Lol. white people steal and commit suicide way more then blacks but EVERY race steals. So for you to be stupid to even say "why do black people commit more crimes then asians and whites".

You wanted a logical answer there you are.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Statistically there are very few black people in Ireland, so crimes committed there must be committed by mainly white people, so your point is ..... what exactly?|`|HZubplhvaa	Because of African Americans past.

We're only human.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Wrong category, but here's da thing man, you said that azns are like whites which isn't true & might as well consider it a stereotype.

Before more black people chose to come to the UK or were invited to do so to work 50 years or so ago..we had no crime in a predominantly white country? Of course there was crime from petty theft to murder...young men have always used knives..Teddy Boys in the 1950's were white...Mods and Rockers in the 60's white youths. The question should be more specific why is black male crime viewed differently from white male crime? Lets stop focusing purely on the colour of the criminals skin and also ask why boy's/men's behaviour is not able to be adequately controlled or indeed, punished.  Young black women are not stabbing each other, shooting each other in the numbers you are talking about, if at all!  We also have to ask about the way our black communities are policed, over representation of black people in prison is not purely down to the fact that they are more criminal than whites. There are factors of racism to be accounted for as well.  Poverty and learned hoplessness, lack of opportunities and aspiration are also factors.  Not all black people have the same opportunities. The debate has to adopt a synthesised approach to the issue.  Also, be careful about quoting stats regarding black crime..are shops more or less likely to press charges against black or white 'lifters'? These questions need to be asked not just assume that blck people must naturally be thieves...dangerous acceptance...|`|441GSyaMaa	I believe that statistically black people commit more petty crimes such as shop lifting, car crimes, drug crimes and such.

There are criminals in every race. People never acsociate crime with Asians... But I hear a lot of crazy stories about Asian murderers etc.|`|5J8OZAJFaa	This is one of the biggest questions in criminology, so there's a couple of answers:    1. Black people have less attachment to their families that Asian and therefore have less support from home and rules and regulations to follow.     2. The the world of justice is biased against black people, which means that a black man is more likely to be stopped on the street, be arrested, stay in the custody, get prosecuted and finally end up in jail. This makes the crime rates higher for that race.    3. Black people are a part of the British culture. They are born here, go to the same school as white British kids.. etc, and therefore have the same expectations on themselves as everybody else. However, since these goals are harder to achieve for black people because of the sociological construction (racism) they use other ways of achieving their goals, by committing crime.     Many asian, on the other hand, came to this country or are fully aware of a belonging to an another culture. This means that their expectations on themselves would be lower|`|ndW3nWWHaa	First off, this is in no way intended to be racist, just based on trends of society I see, and is above all a THEORY:    I think there are people in the black community, going along with the poor theory, that feel that the system isn't designed for them. They feel victimized growing up in a poor community or when they see racism in the media. They in turn feel like crime can be their only option or is justified.    If you're talking about the stereotype that blacks are more criminally inclined then I would think that's due to the fact that prison census' will usually have a majority of blacks or, more than likely, just close-minded racism.|`|DIj072Sqaa	It's a mixture of cultural and socioeconomic reasons although some of the statements made in the question presupposes that this is statistically true on a global scale when I suggest you mean within certain environments. Just by sheer numbers there are probably more Asian criminals in the world on the grounds that there are more Asians in the world so it would make sense.     There is an association of black people with crime and drugs that is frequently propagated through the media. Sadly there are significant numbers of people who justify this stereotype even though it represents a small minority of the population. Why? Because of visibility.    To draw an analogy - imagine I go on holiday to Mumbai, I read Lonely Planet and stay in a backpacker's hostel which is surrounded by beggars. I get extorted by a taxi driver and then become nervous to leave the hostel so stop travelling and end up going home. In this instance I've created an image in my mind based on limited experience which can be paralleled to the before mentioned stereotype.    There are two more factors. Crime figures can also be distorted by stereotyping by the police and if there is a sociological impact of stereotyping of young people within a society then they are more likely to fall into the proscribed role. Of course there are almost certainly hundreds/thousands of academic papers on the subject and I'm sure they would make interesting reading.|`|OUBKWrf2aa	B/c When u think of African, u think of Drugs, sex, gang, homeless.

Many do not have their fathers in their home as they grow up.  So they are left to run the streets when they should be studying or learning something to improve themselves.    What makes Asians study to improve themselves?  As a group, Asians seem to understand, like the Whites,  what it takes to have a life.    Do the crime, do the time.  What a waste of human lives.  Rev David Manning says many Blacks are dishonorable.  He is on YouTube.|`|kq1RIDEoaa	Are they?  not in my town.  But then we have quite a high crime rate but over 90% of the people who live here are white?

BTW do you have a sister, cause asian women are so dirty in bed!|`|819sWJJtaa	you do not make sense.|`|li0MavQ0aa	The answer is so obvious but people fail to notice. It is a fact that in more poverty stricken areas, there is more crime. No matter what race it is. Money is not the root of all evil, on the contrary, the lack of money is. The reason being is that poverty creates depression. Depression can create aggression. Now throw alcohol and drugs in the mix. Get it. Not all poor people are aggressive and depressed but when you are speaking amongst thousands of people, you'll find that there are more depressed and pissed off poor people then there are of people who are well to do. Now think about history and what some races have been through on a mass scale and imagine their mind sets. Those people had children and passed down there aggression and depression to their children and they in turn taught their children. And so on and so forth. It gets deeper than that but that's the jist of my understanding.

AA11648578	In Sura Hajj (Pilgrimage) 22:52-53, Muhammad confessed his mistake, alleging that all prophets were tempted by Satan who inspire them with demonic verses, as if they were actually revealed by God. But later on Allah abrogated those Satanic Verses with new revelations and instructs his prophets with new verses. According to Islam, Allah permits such demonic inspiration to test weak believers and to cut off those with hardened hearts.  Never did We send a messenger or a prophet before thee, but, when he framed a desire, Satan threw some (vanity) into his desire: but Allah will cancel anything (vain) that Satan throws in, and Allah will confirm (and establish) His Signs: for Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom:  That He may make the suggestions thrown in by Satan, but a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and who are hardened of heart: verily the wrong-doers are in a schism far (from the Truth): Hajj (Pilgrimage) 22:52-53.

Peace ?  ^_^|`|cd969f9c7a6bf20748a5b6528e2da246aa	'Arab' when used in the Qur'an or the Sunnah is usually always referring to a beduin(desert Arab)|`|mOWyzwubaa	Glorious Quran doesnt speak very good about arabs,therefore the traditional so called scholars had no other way to change the spelling of arabs  they call Araab = ??????? = bedouins = desert people    what in arabic language is spelled for arabs in Glorious Quran !    there are 8 verses in Glorious Quran which has this word "araabs"    ???????     9:90 ???????  9:97 ???????  9:99 ???????  9:101 ???????  9:120 ???????  48:11 ???????  48:16 ???????  49:14 ???????  i guess all are for desert people ! what is the plural for word  Arab  in Glorious Quran ,   this is how they distort and play with the words of Glorious Quran,
14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	It is the role of the MIND to prevent one from accessing the Esoteric realms within oneself, and it does a wonderful job distracting and preventing one from making progress.    Create for yourself a little Matra that you can repeat to yourself that makes you experience being at peace and intricate enough to require a little concentration.  Then sit in a comfortable position and concentrate on repeating your Matra, over and over again for as long as you can.    If you experience some relaxation and some peace then you need to congratulate yourself... meditation is not at all easy.  Oh, by the way, As ones attention nears ones throat chakra [which is the sleep center] one is tempted to fall asleep and one can do this without even knowing it.    Peace and good luck|`|CnqGu1Taaa	you need to fast while meditating............cleanse your soul as well|`|FmazIF6Maa	Try guided meditation tapes until your  mind learns a little discipline. You can buy them or make them yourself if you've got a mic.     They help  give you something to focus on so your mind doesn't wander as much. After a while you find you don't need them anymore.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	say "ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"    I hear meditation room smell like fart...|`|AA10696542	In Satanism, they tell you to picture a bright light. Bright as the sun. Just picture that color.|`|Wt398Yueaa	Many in the west have that problem.  We are trained to think our way through everything - and then we don't know how to stop, or even pause.     One stepping stone, which worked for me and has helped many others, is active meditations. The idea is to first move the body energetically. This loosens the grip of the mind and makes it easier to fall inside. In the end all techniques fall away - but they can be very useful along the way. Apart from the links below, there are many people involved in 'shamannic dancing', 'dance therapy' etc. For that matter, I think that many involved in the dance culture are looking for meditation, even if they might call it something else.|`|llDXCv4raa	You're probably trying to hard. Thoughts will cross your mind. Just observe them kind of floating by and don't linger on them. Think of them as a passing breeze. Focus on your breathing and try to feel as one with your surroundings.|`|AA11043053	Sometimes noticing your intrusive thoughts is the first step in meditating. You've found that there are many things cluttering your life via these thoughts. Acknowledge them and allow yourself to return to noticing your breath, with every detail that you can: The way your chest rises and falls, the expansion of your ribs, one by one, the feel of air on each hair in your nose, the changes in temperature in you windpipe, etc. Focusing on the breath brings you to the here & now. The more detail you can add, the fewer intrusive thoughts will creep in.|`|02eopur0aa	You should meditate on the word of GOD! Clearing your mind will lead to things you should avoid!|`|bGUWUgUqaa	In the 3rd section of the Ninth Lecture of the Zhuan Falun book on the web, you can learn the tips about achieving a calm mind.  The mediation mechanism is well explained in the 'China Falun Gong' book. The effects and advantages are discussed in details in the Zhuan Falun Lecture. Both books and meditation demonstration video are free to download from the URL listed below. If you need any help, contact a local practitioner in your area for free instructions.    Falun Gong was found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China. About 100 million followers like the practice in over 80 countries worldwide. Falun Gong is an ancient practice for the body, mind, and spirit based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Falun Gong consists of five sets of powerful exercises.    Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Daoists have been persecuted in China. The most offensive human right violation is the organ harvesting from the Falun Gong practitioners in China. Can you kindly sign a petition to stop persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China, please ?  http://cipfg.org/en/news/petition.html

Okay, if you fight back and win by a landslide, he should leave you alone. But you could easily get in huge trouble with the school. You should take some self defense classes. (Knowing pressure points, arm locks, and where to block is much more useful than knowing where to punch.)    Really though, you should avoid being around him when there aren't teachers around or talk to the school councilor. Playing things by the book might seem weak, but its smarter and it always works to your advantage.

Ra8cdjbDaa	It is human nature to use the stall that seems most clean.  I usually use the farthest one away from the door because I have seen that the leas amount of people go in there, hence, cleaner stall.  The fact that someone else is in the one next door doesn't factor into the decision at all.  I don't think most people are thinking about who is next to you doing what.    Just feel glad you don't live in China.. I lived over there for six years and they stalls are only about 4' high, without doors in most cases.  You have to look at the person next to you while you're in there doing your thing. ~ugh~|`|AA11341587	The human nature part is to use the far stalls.  Although I am less likely to sit next to an occupied stall when given a choice of 10 stalls.    Maybe try the close stalls or the ones in the middle and see if you get the same results.  And 5 minutes later you should be about done anyway.|`|ojFatDVnaa	man law says privacy is golden and to leave as much space as possible, it must have been a woman dressed as a man.|`|YCpDZGH6aa	they also want to be furthest from the door. By the way, because this is a fact, the stalls closest to the doors are not as frequently used, making them cleaner cleaner than those back ones you use.|`|2D1uxlUfaa	they wouldn't know you're there, unless you were making large pooping and farting sounds or the person stooped low to see your legs. But if they can sense that you're there, they want privacy too so they use the next farthest one.|`|41dbd5f49217df2a78323631830fd261aa	the other 10 might have had some surprises in them that would have made it difficult or unsafe to use.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	people don't wanna sit by the door anything can happen

It's a coincidence that both translate into English as "after".    Maybe it helps you to consider similar English pairs, like "despite"/"although" or "during"/"while".

I guess that is a question, but I am not at all sure what you are asking.

If so, fine with me, but I am not holding my breath, since humans have been thinking up definitions of hypothetical gods specifically to prevent this from happening.    But now a question for you.    Are willing to consider that science and logic might someday prove the existence of god, but prove a god completely different from anything you have imagined?    Instead of rewarding blind faith and uncritical obedience, She rewards critical thinking and fair skepticism and before she was proved to exist, she had only let skeptical atheists into heaven with her?

Any god that existed but wasn't  understanding of that would not be very just.|`|h3gMzNS3aa	The more science progresses the more it's been in conflict with religion. The scientific method is brutally objective and religion has had to bend to accomodate itself to science (eg. noone believes it took 6 days to create the earth anymore) when it's honest with it, though this doesn't stop religion from trying to bend science to fit it though it's never accepted by objective scientists.    It's not possible to prove or disprove god because if god doesn't exist you can't disprove a negative. But religion can be disproven. That means if there is a god then it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the figure you think god is. So in the end the proof or disproof of god leaves atheists in the same position they're in now.|`|AA11043053	I think you're so open minded that parts of it leaked out.|`|zlHgIltOaa	I agree with the first answer. A true "thinking man/ woman" would be agnostic.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	God is possible, just not probable.    Especially not as described by any of the various religions invented by mankind over the ages.    Science might someday show that there is something else out there - some kind of higher intelligence, etc. - but it is just as improbable that it would turn out to be the judeo-christian 'god', or islams 'allah than for it to turn out to be Odin, or Ra.    In the meantime, even if there is a miniscule chance that science might someday disprove the atheist position - I still don't consider that sufficient reason to accept bronze age mythology as 'real'.

You need to know yourself, know what you are passionate about, and pursue that. If there is something you can't wait to do, then that is the thing you do.  You say you would like to pursue higher education. You don't need to commit to a full schedule. Take a class or two, to help you find out what interests you and accumulate credits along the way.    BE A BETTER PERSON? Try doing volunteer work at a soup kitchen or youth program or old age home. Plant a tree. Doing something for someone else is not only good for the community, but it wil be fulfilling for you--AND make you "more interesting" as well. It is hard to be bored when interacting with others.    HAPPIER? Again, do something for someone else.    Perhaps your relationship did nt fail for the reason you thought it did. Maybe it was not that you had ceased to be "the life of the party" but that you are still too self-involved, worrying about being boring, worrying about finding happiness and love.

(Maybe not so good in the rain.)    Learn a more interesting instrument than the guitar, such as the trombone, pan-pipes or maybe the accordion.    As you are dressed like a pirate, start a pirate club in your local neighbourhood. You could have weekly meetings and watch all the classic pirate movies, and drink piratical drinks such as rum.    Take afternoon walks around the town and stop into every shop to get to know the people who work there.    If you ever have any spare time, volunteer somewhere - it can be very satisfying to help other people.    And a way to make yourself feel happier all the time:    On a regular basis, remind yourself that you are unique and special, even if you don't do any wacky activities.

Going to the gym wouldn't hurt either. You get healthy, meet people, and look good for girls, you win all the way around.     Inform yourself about current events. Be able to talk about popular culture, what you like, what you don't like. Don't talk about sports (especially soccer, what is it about soccer, men are obsessed with it) all the time. Read some of the best-selling books (get them at the library and save money). Read some internet news sites from other countries. All of these give you interesting facts and opinions and make for more interesting conversation.    And don't drink too much Guiness! :D
rYaqoPTHaa	A day in the life  sort of    A long, long time ago (last Tuesday) in a land far, far away (actually about a 10 minute walk) there was a knight who happened upon a huge castle.  (Actually, our library is pretty small.)  It seemed fateful that on this very day there was a maiden (rather plain looking older lady working at the library) trapped inside suffering great peril!  Just than a handsome knight arrived (that parts true) and inquired of the maiden what was troubling her.  (I asked the old lady why she looked confused.)  The maiden spoke of an evil force blocking her way to freedom (the computer was down) and asked the handsome noble knight for assistance.  (She said, what you think it is?)      Filled with fury and a keen sense of adventure the knight charged through the huge labyrinth and came across the beast and did slay it with a mighty blow!  (I turned the computer off than restarted it.)  The maiden was overcome with joy!  (She cursed under her breath.)  The knight than turned and went about his heroic business.  (I went to check my e-mail.)   In the hamlet below that mighty castle there are stories of the brave knight and his heroism to this very day!  (She left a note for the next shift.)    Trudging on for days through an immense forrest (I walked down the road for a minute or two) the knight came upon his greatest foe yet!  (There was some ice on the road.)  After a fierce battle he escaped the wrathful grip of his foe (I walked around it) just in time as the earth itself, protesting such evil swallowed up the foul beast forever!  (A salt truck came by)    Continuing on his heroic journey, after many more weeks of wandering the wilderness, our hero the great knight had finally arrived at his destination!  (About a 5 or 10 minute walk to the post office)  His package for the king was of paramount importance (I was sending off a resume) and haste in his travels quickened as he saw the citadel up ahead.  (I sauntered towards the door)  The king was thrilled to finally receive his important documents of crucial state matters (the postal worker looked annoyed when I handed him nickels) and declared the knight a national hero!  With great pomp and celebration the knight left the dwelling of the king feeling a sense of great pride!  (The door clipped my shin on the way out.)    After all his adventures the night finally decided to retire to his modest castle on the mountain top as there was no more peril distressing the nobles and maidens of this great land.  (I started home as there is really nothing to do in this town.)  Even in this last journey there was adventure as he yielded passage of a great heard of buffalo (stoplight) and crossed a mighty river (bridge over the stream).  At last he climbed the mountain where his home stood and entered in triumph!  (I walked up the hill and let the dog out.)

syMxQEF3aa	I wish you went to my Mosque, I would love to help a new Muslim learn the religion and prayer. Maybe you should ask for help. People are depressing, I know....don't lose hope though! And all those people will be held accountable on the day of judgement, those that didn't help you even though they know you are a new muslim and you said you needed help, and those gossiping are doing something very haraam. Keep trying!|`|VN30ib8eaa	You need to communicate with people, dont expect everyone will come to you and offer things.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	You should make an effort.

I have been a Muslim for about a year now and i haven't stepped one foot in the masjid-only because i'm shy and i've heard a lot about how reverts are treated.

You said you asked and keep asking, and you continue being ignored. I would say if you are comfortable and willing, call the imam and explain your situation (explain what you are comfortable explaining, and at the least the fact you need help with these things and you feel no one is willing to help).    If there is another mosque in your area though... perhaps you should consider going there instead. I understand what some said about ignoring what is going on with the members, but I know personally I would have trouble with this. Sometimes words hurt whether we feel like allowing them to or not. If you feel that hurt by your experience and feel it will effect your time spent there, and there are other mosques within your area that provide you with another option, I don't see the harm in going there instead. Perhaps, if you do go to a new one, you might even explain your current situation to the imam there (the first time you go). That way they will hopefully usher you in with open arms, and be more than willing to teach you whatever it is you need to know.    Though congratulations on going to a mosque in the first place :-) I'm still not ready to take that step, yet I'm encouraged someone out there (who had a little fear as I have) had the courage to go anyway. Don't give up just yet. You give me hope I'll one day be able to do the same.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Intersex conditions are frequently not discussed in high school health classes.    The only reason I know so much about them is because of my training as a nurse.    Please don't be so hard on people who are ignorant to these physiological conditions.  I think you need to lower your expectations for people.    I know that you want everyone to treat you a certain way, but sometimes you just have to be forgiving and understanding of their ignorance.    I do not really like the term "hermaphodites" for intersexed people...but anyway....    Look, just do your thing (praying, etc.) as best you can and then go home.  No need to dwell on whether your mosque is supportive or not.  Are you going there to commune with God or with people?|`|HnX6qyuGaa	http://www.islamicfinder.org/prayer/inde...    this site will teach u how to pray in voice  picture and translation|`|Fe8Wvmyxaa	Asalam Alakum    Sorry about your situation.  And welcome to Islam.    That is a sad story ,I wish that never happened to you.    Now you are learning Islam,that doesn't mean that the other muslims know Islam fully.    Maybe you could teach them that in the Quran that Allah says"If you backbite it is as if your eating you their flesh(body meat).    JUST like people on yahoo answers didn't know about what intersex meant ,and said weird things that's probably how they were.You could try telling them and they will hopefully try to understand , and if they hear others talking about you they ll tell them.    Their is at least someone else their that understands,hopefully.    I know if you came to my mosque(masjid) I would have been soooo happy(no kidding). I love people who newly except Islam. If I could I would bake you a cake (even though I dint know how to )and invite you to my house.      If you need help with anything e-mail me.  Ill tell you about prayer ,zakat , end everything I know.      Peace-your new muslim friend.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	I dont get what u mean by intersex even though with ur defintion.  I am sorry if i offended you but i dont hate you.  I like you that your a muslim and i am fine with it even if ur intersexed.    My question is that is the imam also being ignorant ?  Where do you live???    I am sorry, But have patience.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	It took me a few yrs to get the courage to go to a masjid, and I was so nervous, plus I thought everyone was gonna ask me a million questions - guess what? No one cared I was there!!  LOL. And the funny part was I taught myself how to pray, but I though we recited every word - I had memorized it all, and boy was I surprised!  I go to a place with mostly Pakistani's and the sisters are so shy.  Even now, a few yrs later, I will return salams' and say salam alaikum,  and we smile at eachother, but that's all. I am glad no one made a fuss over me. I just kinda kept going and blended in as best I could. I love standing shoulder to shoulder with other sisters, even if I have seen there face for yrs, and don't even know their names.  They miss me when I am not there, there eyes light up if I walk in and have been away for a week or two!  I have vistited other nearby masjid, some very huge and beautiful, I just blend in, and I like that. I am there for Allah, no one else.  I love the sisters and omg, the lunch that is sold after Jummah is out of this world Pakistani food! Chicken Biriyani, samosa's, chicken or beef kebab's, you name it.  I imagine you are more ID'ed as a man, and go to the men's section.  Just keep going, don't worry, they could be as nervous as you, and sometimes that can come off as being very unfreindly.   I think if I would have gone to the masjid, needing to learn, and all, I would have really dumfounded them.. There are some americans there, but in the men's section(blacks and whites).   But I tell you, I would be the 1st one there to help someone new, who DID come in like you..   Perhaps this will be your place, in time, to help new reverts, insha allah.  May Allah bless you, brother, for your devotion and Allah lighten your heart, insh allah.  I say stay. But go where you are led.  Here is a link- enter your zip at the top, and you will get a pop up kinda thing that will show you the Islamic centers in your area, and also any Muslim owned businesses.  Everything will be fine.  I always say, I am glad I met Islam, before I met Muslims!|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Oh dear Yousef !  I am really sorry to know about the indifference and lack of cooperation by the local masjid worshipers. Depending upon where you leave, they might be half literate, semi-skilled workers whose first and foremost consideration is making money. Normally Muslims take the new converts with open arms and try to help them as much as they possibly can. But you know, all people are not the same.    Permit me to apologize on behalf of them. People born with seeing or hearing disability are given all the sympathy in the world. But many people treat inter sex  persons differently, because of a wrong notion that they indulge in unnatural sex. If someone tries to lead a normal life in spite of his disability, he should be encouraged and helped. I am sure God Almighty who made you, will surely help  you to lead a happy and meaningful life and will reward you highly in the hereinafter for any inconvenience and deprivation you suffered.  Accidents and mishaps do happen. It is a sad fact of life. Look at mentally retarded children. The poor souls even do not know the problem they have. God Almighty must have given lot of other faculties to overcome the disadvantage you have.  So do not despair and do not go to Masjid, if you do not want to.     Allah is everywhere and if you can clean you heart of greed, lust, hatred and jealousy, He would like to enter your heart. He is nearer than your jugular vein.  So relax and take it easy. Help is under way.    Feel free to write to me, for exchange of views. May Allah bless you.

You are not required to tell anyone about your personal situation regarding your sexuality. This must be a very difficult situation for you already. Just rememeber that Allah made you as you are supposed to be and through every hardship comes ease. People can be wary of new comers mostly because they are feeling the same as you. Just nervous and trying not to put any pressure. Speak up and let your needs be known.      Please contact me by e-mail, I will help you all I can, to learn what you need to know, please don't be discouraged.

No lol, I'm JK!    Ok listen brother, you need to go back and discuss with the Imam, do not give yourself excuses and forget what they think about you, their opinion should have no impact on you, because it is not they who are going to judge you at the end. Their view does not matter only Allah (SWT)'s does.   So go back and talk to the Imam and hold you head high, because who cares what the others say. May Allah (SWT) guide them.

D9k5Fou5aa	I think part of is is that a lot, if not most of the Asian girls who date non-Asian tend to bash on Asian men. As a result, Asian ppl REACT. On the other hand, most Asian guys, and most non-asian guys who do date out of their race tend to be open minded and not bash on their own race. Most non-Asian women who date out of their race are open minded as well. If you think about it, which race and sex bash their own ppl more than others? Asian women! Not saying all are like that, but it's very normal.  How often do u see an Asian girl say "I only date White guys,  I hate Asian guys cuz they're this and that". COMMON! On the other hand, it's common to hear Asian guys say "I open to dating non-Asians". Rarely will you see Asian guys bash their own women.|`|nuUsNzj7aa	because asian girls who date non-asians usually sucks,not all but most.|`|3r252UIRaa	Asian women date and marry white men very often.

0fYzvVk2aa	Wow, that's a tough situation.  It's frustrating to think of a child being raised with opposing religions and then being expected to chose one of them to practice. It's as if neither one of your parents takes their beliefs seriously, they just practice a religion just to do it.       If I were you I think I would need some serious time-out from going through the motions of practicing two opposing religions which didn't have any meaning to me.  Maybe if you tell your parents that you don't intend for your abstinance from holidays to be permament they will not throw such a fuss.      I don't blame you for feeling the way you do.  I hope you continue to love God and seek out his word and his will.  I can kind of relate because your parents seem like the kind of people who think of religion as something that you're just supposed to do and that there is no one ultimate truth (otherwise how why would they have married each other and exposed you to both religions?). But there IS one truth, One God and One Way.  It sounds like you definately need to take some time to distance yourself from your parents opposing view points that neither one really believes to be THE truth and find the truth for yourself and your children =)|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	what do your kids want to do?|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Talk to your parents in a loving and non-confrontational manner.

You can have Christmas in a non materialistic way. It can be about serving the poor and appreciating family. IF you are Christian (if not, nevermind) then I just think why not let the kids have their fun holidays.    I know John Piper advocates celebrating Christmas in a non materialistic way, they give out one or two good presents, they have a "Joshua Tree" instead of a Christmas tree (a branch decorated with symbols meaningful to the family) and spend the holiday doing community service. Sounds nice to me.|`|99f3375ecb12e908f1956b8e03fc4f44aa	Why does the holiday have to be religious? Im agnostic but I still celebrate all the wonderful (or awful, lol) materialistic fun of christmas and i intend to do the same with my kids.  I feel like they will be missing out on a happy family celebration if we just make it like any other day, and may feel left out when their friends talk about all the fun they had on christmas.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	First of all, in BOTH cases, the holidays did not start out materialistic. It is more an American problem than a religious one.  There are many Christian sects that do NOT celebrate the birth of Jesus with materialism.  Also, Hanukkah is a MINOR Jewish festival, NOT a major holiday.  All you need do is light candles and celebrate the REAL meaning which is the survival of the Jewish people against overwhelming odds.    Your parents probably want to indulge their grandchildren, and holidays are a way to do it. Instead, let them give gifts on the children's' birthdays, and use holidays to be together with them and celebrate the family.|`|XpaLyWYOaa	Mmm... I think you might be a little out of place to ask that of your family. It would probably be in the best interest of everyone if you just educate your children about both religions and explain to them why you don't celebrate those holidays yourselves. Not letting your family include your children in their religious holiday gifting only teaches your children intolerance.     Plus it's just rude to not accept a gift from someone especially if it has religious importance to the gifter. I'm Christian and I wouldn't tell a friend of another faith I'm not going to accept a gift from them on a holiday they celebrate and have chosen to include me in their gifting just because I don't believe the same things they believe in.|`|p4fLAt7aaa	By the time ur kid is 6 he'l be beggig for christmas     TOYS|`|q6KmVWS1aa	Each person has their own views.  Jesus was not born on Dec. 25th Actually He was born in the Summer around Aug-Sept.    Holidays should not be about materialistic things it should be about the celebration of God's love for us.    Religion, isn't going to take you to heaven-your relationship with God is!  Tell your family that its your relationship with God that's what counts, not what religion you are.    Religion isn't salvation!

Csi5Vjb0aa	SOme prayers God will not answer. The Bible plainly teaches us  that ours is a Prayer hearing, and a prayer answering, God instead of a dead God.  The Bible clearly teaches us that the Heavenly Father is more likely to bestow his blessings upon us, than we are to receive them. Prayer is the divinely ordainedchannel through which we are to receive the blessings from God. What then are some prayers that God cannot answer?  To pray for forgiveness while not forgiving other is a prayer that God cannot answer. It you are not willing to forgive then it is senseless to be praying for forgiveness. Disobedient Christians who do  not try to win souls, need not expect God to answer their prayers for sinners to be converted. If you've benn praying for a long time about the same thing maybe you should try doing your part. If your asking for peace but you go and curse people God cannot answer that prayer. Make it so where you prayer is easily answer but don't stop praying because God hears your prayers he's just waiting for you to act upon them. But make your your praying for the right things because you could be praying for something thats not meant for you. Or maybe God isnt ready for you to have what you want he's not a GOD of instant gratification have patience and if it is the will of God it will be done.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophren...|`|IYBTmH26aa	God usually answers in a still, small voice.|`|ttCkz39aaa	what does your gut feeling tell you|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Seek a counselor ASAP.|`|31cc91292d4acf2ddc9a6d449e86868eaa	Follow your gut.

God created Souls as aspects of Himself and then the Creation so that they and God through His Souls can explore and experience what Neutral Spiritual Energy can be.   This Knowledge is still growing and expanding, and we Souls are likewise rising on a "ladder of Life" and ones position on this ladder is determined by ones Spiritual Evolution, the result of ones Knowledge acquired by completing Karma.    I say this to suggest that God is not hiding in the other room, or behind some cloud, but ones Spirituality is a part of God and is focused in ones Soul.  It is our own Knowledge that we can access via our intuition, if one is able to do this?    Each of us is living out a life based on ones Fate Karma that one designed at the close of ones last life  specifically to address Karma in this life.   So the margin of wiggle room in ones Fate Karma is low to non-existent.  So hopefully what you want to do is what you must do, that is of course the most happy of circumstances.

You may actually be hearing God, but that's not going to stop people from thinking you're crazy, and it won't stop you from becoming homeless ringing a bell and yelling in the streets about the second coming, at that point it doesn't matter if your hearing God or just crazy either way your life becomes doo doo.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	What did you ask God for and what was His answer to you ?  God cannot go against His Word, so if the answer is something that would go against His Word or the nature of God , most likely it is not from Him...  But it happens that sometimes we think we hear God and we act on it, just to find out later that it was not God, that happens to all of us, then you just repent and God will forgive you...  God knows your heart, if in your heart you want to do His will then He will clear it up for you...  When I am not sure if it is God or not...I usually wait until I have clarity...and you can pray that God would make it plain to you...then He will...God bless

Xsen794Aaa	If you get any self-study guide like the Tuttle flash cards, Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary, etc.  They have most of the 2000 kanji.  You should know a bit of Japanese already before you learn kanji though; you definitely have to know hiragana and katakana perfectly.      If you don't know any kanji right now, I'd suggest finding workbooks. "Remembering the Kanji" is good; here's the link to Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-...     If you know a few already, "Essential Kanji" is a good quick reference, but it doesn't have a lot of information.  I wouldn't get "Kanji Pict-o-Graphix;" it's a fun book for getting the basic meaning of some basic kanji, but it doesn't teach usage, which is the important thing.  Tuttle makes the best kanji flash cards, but unfortunately, they're not perfect; they have mistakes sometimes and they're not laminated.    My favorite dictionary is "Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary," but you need to know a bit about kanji before you can use it properly.  It has all the useful information a learner might need including ordered lists of frequently used kanji.    Some kanji you should definitely start off with are days of the week, numbers, seasons, north-south-east-west, hot/cold, common verbs like come and go, and some other ones.  There's a long list I could think of, but I've typed too much already.      Ganbare!|`|b3835ed6ecba00bbca3e1188d38ea41caa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji Ortho...
fWrygrgMaa	The atheist is one that has no belief in a god or gods. Some however will go as far as to claim that no god or gods exists. It comes down to a person's view on the lack of evidence. Some may simply find that there's no evidence and therefore do not believe. They are open to the idea of some such entity. While others will find the lack of evidence, nature of the universe, and logic of the matter convincing enough to declare no god exists. A third possibility between the two is where some won't declare there is no god but find the lack of evidence convincing enough to state such an entity is extremely improbable. They have no god belief and highly doubt that one exists.    Agnosticism means there is a lack of knowledge. It can refer to anything but is commonly used in reference to religion. It can be said that one, or all of us, does not have enough information to determine if a god or gods exists or not. However, that does not answer the question of god belief. Either you believe in a god or you don't, there is no middle ground there. One cannot be only agnostic.|`|z74a7wvlaa	Does not, do not are the same negatives... meaning lossers.

Da1krM3Daa	On Valentine's Day we think of those  Who make our lives worthwhile,  Those gracious, friendly people who  We think of with a smile.      I am fortunate to know you,  That's why I want to say,  To a rare and special person:  Happy Valentine's Day!                                   OR              Kudzu is green,   my dog's name is Blue   And I'm so lucky   to have a sweet thang like you.   Yore hair is like cornsilk   a-flapping in the breeze.   Softer than Blue's   And without all them fleas.   You move like the bass,   Which excite me in May.   You ain't got no scales   But I luv you anyway.   You're as graceful as okry   Jist a-dancin' in the pan.   Yo're as fragrant as SunDrop   Right out of the can.   You have all yore teeth,   For which I am proud;   I hold my head high   When we're in a crowd.   On special occasions,   When you shave yore armpits,   Well, I'm in hawg heaven,   I'm plumb outta my wits.   Still them fellers at work   They all want to know,   What I did to deserve   Such a purty, young doe.   Like a good roll of duct tape   Yo're there fer yore man,   To patch up life's troubles   And stick 'em in the can.   Yo're as strong as a four-wheeler   Racin' through the mud,   Yet fragile as that sanger   Named Naomi Judd.   Yo're as cute as a junebug   A-buzzin' overhead.   You ain't mean like no fire ant   Upon which I oft' tread.   Cut from the best pattern   Like a flannel shirt of plaid,   You sparked up my life   Like a Rattletrap shad.   When you hold me real tight   Like a padded gunrack,   My life is complete;   Ain't nuttin' I lack.   Yore complexion, it's perfection,   Like the best vinyl sidin'.   Despite all the years,   Yore age, it keeps hidin'.   And when you get old   Like a '57 Chevy,   Won't put you on blocks   And let grass grow up heavy.   Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie   With a RC cold drank,   We go together   Like a skunk goes with stank.   Some men, they buy chocolate   For Valentine's Day;   They git it at Wal-Mart,   It's romantic that way.   Some men git roses   On that special day   From the cooler at Kroger.   "That's impressive," I say.   Some men buy fine diamonds   From a flea market booth.   "Diamonds are forever,"   They explain, suave and couth.   But for this man, honey,   These will not do.

AA11232725	Romans 4:13-  For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.  14  For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect,  15  because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law there is no transgression.  16  Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all    Galatians 3:7  Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham.  8  And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, "In you all the nations shall be blessed."  9  So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Yes.

Wafa Sultan, intelligent women. I knew her daughter in high school.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	From 3:52 to 4:20 or so. It says about the flogging verse.     My questions to her:  Did she live at that time?  Did she know how the society worked back then?  Were there the same rules as of today?  Were there the same technology as today?  Were there the same clothes as today?  Were the structure and surroundings same as today?  Were there places such as named China or India back then as today?  ______________________________________...    If she doesnt like the punishment, it doesnt mean its wrong. Is She great? No! It is Allah who is the Greatest.  At 5:46 she says she "shudders" when she hears the hadith "A woman's paradise is under her husband's foot".    Meaning of Shudder - http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/s...    Does she not know the meaning of being mature and adult?  Did she not go to an english medium school?   That hadith to my expectations doesnt even meet what she says. Why would I shudder? WHY WHY WHY ????????????  Husband's foot doesnt directly mean under the FEET.   IT is rather that A wife should be obedient and not a slave. It means the reward of obeying her husband is PARADISE. DOES SHE KNOW WHAT PARADISE ISS?????????????????????    At 7:37 she gives us a hadith.  Well tell her that After Muhammad was done preaching his message. WHOLE OF ARABIA ACCEPTED ISLAM. AFTER RASUL'S (SAWS) DEATH EVENTUALLY STUFF STARTED TO GET CORRUPTED AS WELL AS CONFUSED. TELL HER TO READ THE SEERAH OF THE 4 RIGHTLY GUIDED CALIPHS.    IF SHE STILL NEEDS PROOF TELL HER TO PROVE HER STATEMENTS BY GIVING HER SOLID EVIDENCE FROM HER FAKE RELIGION.     Makkah and Madina are Holy cities and Allah is protecting them. Im not going to show the hadith or verse here BUT They were made sanctuaries.   And why does it matter that the jews were of the region?  There were muslims and christians and jews in Arabia.   As Allah said " This day I have perfected your deen and etc..."    At 8:30 - If they critize Muhammad (saws) and his actions and etc..It is as if we chopped off their noses.   That is one lack of knowledge sentence.   Look there that person is meaning if they find fault in our last prophet's (saws) stuff then it is as if they find error in us. So let me remind that person that Muhammad is a prophet of Allah and we are not.     At 3:50 - What she saying is full of useless baseless info.  Look here buddy, Islam = Religion. Muslim = human.  If what she said is that at 4:20 it forces.  Then if ISLAM FORCES US then ALL MUSLIMS WOULD HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH OSAMA. IF ISLAM FORCED US ALL MUSLIM WOMAN WOULD HAVE WORN HIJAB.   And you dont see all muslim girls wearing HIJAB.  DOESNT THAT SOUND LIKE FREE WILL?|`|atAZlwGdaa	Like I said you can make anything up and call it Islam. The books other then the Koran have no basis in truth and have been made up as needed. The books refer to the messenger saying and doing things as needed to prove whatever they want to prove at the time but that does not make it true. Islam is based on the message of Allah in the koran delivered by our beloved messenger muhammad. Find me something you disagree with in the koran and we can discuss it.

The Mayans had a long history of tracking the winter solstice (probably for planting crops) and creating calendars (at least 17 that we know of). At some point, they developed the belief that our sun is a god and that the Milky Way, called the Sacred Tree, was a gateway to the afterlife. After learning from the Olmecs, they began keeping records of the stars patterns of movement and continued to do so for the next 200-300 years. The Mayans then developed their own calendar (The Long Count) ca. 355 B.C. They were able to use their observations and mathematical prowess to calculate the future movements of stars across the sky. The result was that the Mayans discovered the effect of the earths wobbling as it spins on its axis. This wobbling rotation causes the stars patterns of movement to drift gradually in the sky (called precession) in a 5,125-year cycle. The Mayans also discovered that once every cycle the dark band at the center of the Milky Way (called the Galactic Equator) intersects with the Elliptical (the plane of the suns movement across the sky).     During that year, the sun reaches its solstice (a brief moment when the suns position in the sky is at its greatest angular distance on the other side of the equatorial plane from the observer) on December 21 for the Northern Hemisphere and June 21 for the Southern Hemisphere. That year, the solstice occurs at the moment of the conjunction of the Galactic Equator with the Milky Way. The year this occurs (in relation to our Gregorian calendar) is A.D. 2012, and happened last on August 11, 3114 B.C. With Mayan mythology teaching that our sun is a god and the Milky Way is the gateway to life and death, the Mayans concluded that this intersection in the past must have been the moment of creation. Mayan hieroglyphs seem to indicate that they believed the next intersection in 2012 would be some sort of end and a new beginning of a cycle. The Mayans also believed that the blood of human sacrifices was what powered the sun and gave it life.    All the so-called Mayan prophecies of 2012 are nothing more than wildly speculative extrapolations, which are based on the yet uncertain interpretations by scholars of Mayan hieroglyphs. However, the truth is that apart from the astrological convergence, there is little indication that the Mayans prophesied anything specific regarding the events of this distant future. The Mayans were not prophets; they were not even able to predict their own cultural extinction. They were great mathematicians and accomplished sky watchers, but they were also a brutally violent tribal people with a primitive understanding of natural phenomena, subscribing to archaic beliefs and the barbaric practices of blood-letting and human sacrifice.    There is absolutely nothing in the Bible that would present December 21, 2012, as the end of the world. While that date is no less valid for an end-times event than any other future date, the Bible nowhere presents the astronomical phenomena the Mayans pointed to as a sign of the end times. It would seem very inconsistent of God to allow the Mayans to discover such an amazing truth while keeping the many Old Testament prophets ignorant of the timing of the events. In summary, there is absolutely no biblical evidence that the 2012 Mayan prophecy / prediction of doomsday is in any sense valid or probable.    Accepting the Mayan 2012 prophecy logically requires acceptance of the following theories: our sun is a god; the sun is powered by the blood of human sacrifice; the creation moment occurred at 3114 B.C. (despite all evidence that it happened much earlier); and the visual alignment of stars has some significance for everyday human life. Like every other false religion, the Mayan religion sought to elevate to the point of worship that which was created in place of the Creator Himself. The Bible tells us about such false worshipers: They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator (Romans 1:25), and since the creation of the world Gods invisible qualities  His eternal power and divine nature  have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse (Romans 1:20). To accept the Mayan 2012 prophecy also denies the clear biblical teaching about the end of the world, because Jesus told us of that day and hour no one knows, no, not the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father (Mark 13:32).|`|WN4gHMLQaa	The Mayan and the Chinese say no such thing. The Mayan Calendar is supposed to end this day, and the sun is supposed to align with the other planets(this is called the "Dark Rift") It was Nostradamus who came up with this theory, and that is the only reason people believe it is true(because other predictions he made came true.    I don't believe any of this hoopla...|`|yB0nVXfWaa	Oh dear oh dear!  If you knew your Scriptures, you wouldn't ask such questions!  But I do see that you are still very young and have a lot to learn.    Firstly, you are not asking about when the world will end (that's a lot farther on - at least another 1,000 years - see Rev.ch.20), you are asking when Christ will return, because that's what the Lord Jesus was talking about when he said nobody would know the day or hour.      And, whether we're talking about the Lord's return for his Church, or his return in glory to judge the earth at Armageddon, we're still in the right 'ball park'.  I reckon that the reference, is properly speaking, to the first event, because, when that happens, it will then be possible to know exactly when the Second Coming proper will be - in my understanding, 7 years later!    So, you see, we have at least 7 years to play with (excuse my levity) before Armageddon (which, I take it, is what's bothering you).  So the mayans and the chinese have got it wrong, and time will tell whether they're in the right 'ball park'.  I personally believe they are, on that one, but I think you should also beware of giving too much credence to 'extra-biblical' writings (eg. Nostradamus, etc.) on this topic.    For example, there are throughout the religious writings in the world, many 'Flood myths'.  They all agree that the Flood actually happened, so in that they concur with the Bible.  But, if you read their details, you will find there are things added and things taken away when comparing them with the biblical account, making them invalid as regards total integrity.  For it is only the Holy Bible which is totally trustworthy to teach you, for only that has been totally inspired by God.    You see, once you put the Bible amongst other tools by which to evaluate truth, you devalue it.  What you should do it check all these accounts against the biblical account, using it as a yardstick, and then you will not go wrong.    OK, I've visited the website - what's this about the IHC lottery?  They want you to subscribe to a lottery in order to save the world?  How will that knock out the meteor? - but, of course, it will buy some folk some very nice, shiny little rocks in the meantime ...  Cmon - it's 'the love of money' thing again!  Just scratch the surface and money always appears in things that are phoney.  America really does spawn some weird things!    Oh, and by the way, why are you worried?  Are you not sure whether you are going to be with the Lord?  Do you think that, even if it is very near now (which I believe it is), that the Lord has left you out in his care and provision?  That's if you truly are one of his?    Scripture shows clearly what the Lord Jesus will do about his Church when the time comes - for he will not judge the righteous with the wicked (Gen.18:23-25).  Do you not know that these times are spoken of in Matthew 24 and also the Lord says his coming will be 'as in the days of Noah' and 'as in the days of Lot'?  The reason he says this is that this coming time is a time of judgment and, since the righteous (the true believers) have 'passed through' judgment by repentance and faith, he will not judge the two types of people together, but will do for his own what he did for righteous Lot and also for Noah and their families.    Still unclear?  Well, in a nutshell, God got them out, before the judgment came, and there are many promises of this in the Scriptures - it's in just about all of the epistles (especially Thess.), the Lord's Prayer ('Do not bring us to the Time of Trial, but deliver us from (the) evil') and Rev. 3:10.      Also, if you read I Thess. chs.4 and 5, you will see, in the context of Christ's coming for the Church, that this message should be, above all, a great comfort to them (4:18, 5:11).  I mean, if you realised that you had the promise of such a deliverance (I Thess.5:9), wouldn't you feel comforted?
SygvUa0Eaa	Well, obviously, you can't force him to ask you. And asking him, to ask you, would be way out of the question.    The only thing you could do is have someone ask him if he likes you. Whether it's a yes or no answer, she/he can *try* to persuade this guy to ask you out. However, no guarantees are made.    And really, if he doesn't like you, then you're sort of out of luck.

Alternatively there's:    Sam   Mara     I know someone called samara who uses the above two nicknames. The letters in her name are quite similar to the beginning and end of your name ('mar' and 'sa') add a or m to get mara/sam!    As you're quite young it will be fairly easy to get people to call you by your nickname because they won't already have been used to your real name for years and years.

x0giFK1Naa	Speaking as an very long term AP-practicing Christian, sadly the essay above is wrong in just about *every* important detail, yikes!  Never trust driving instructors that haven't seen a car before.    The basics of projection are covered well here:    http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/...    But for a lucidity-specific method, "reality testing" is your search phrase.  Once lucid, either project in your dream or discard the dream imagery and work from the resulting vibrational state instead.  Also research the Monroe Institute's "Lucid Dreaming Series".|`|0fYzvVk2aa	Astral projection is very dangerous and completely pointless. Don't do it.|`|yegDdZfRaa	What is Astral Projection?    A Christian perspective    Astral projection is the idea that one can, with practice, project ones consciousness, soul, or spirit, outside of the body while in a sleeping state.     There are many books and resources that would tell you how this is achieved with much practice. But what isnt always exposed however, are the negative aspects, and harmful/terrifying experiences and attacks the practice often brings about.    If one were to think of our fleshly body as an automobile and our spirit as the person inside it driving around, one might gain a more accurate view of astral projection. One would never drive into a known dangerous neighborhood, get out and leave the car unlocked. Yet, with astral projection, this is exactly what people attempt to do. They try to get out of their bodies while asleep and roam around in their spirit. All the while their body remains open and unguarded. It is theorized, in the opinion of this author, that this may be one possible way for demon possession, prior lives, and and/or split personality to occur.  If one leaves their body, it is a very real possibility for another spirit to come in and occupy it as well.     Most people who have become involved in this practice have many fears about leaving their body. Remember, fear is a good thing. Fear is a God-given self-protection mechanism. Fear keeps us from doing stupid things. Fear helps keep us alive. When we stand on a high precipice and look down, why do we feel fear? The answer is obvious--So we dont fall and get killed! Fear is our instinct that tells us we are in danger when our mind is ignoring common sense.      So why do people do things that are very dangerous and potentially harmful to themselves? Probably because they become addicted to the adrenaline rush they feel if they survive.  Keep in mind the old saying,     There are old pilots, and there are bold pilots. But there are no old, bold pilots!    If you play with fire long enoughyou will get burnt!    Ecclesiastes 12:6-7  Remember him-before the silver cord is severed,   or the golden bowl is broken;   before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,   or the wheel broken at the well,   and the dust returns to the ground it came from,   and the spirit returns to God who gave it.    There are some who believe the reference to the silver cord in the above bible verse is a reference to the silver cord that is thought to connect our soul to our body that is at times reported by those who have left their bodies. If this cord is ever severed, we cannot get back into our body. The separation of spirit and flesh becomes final. In other words, we die. Our body then becomes a carcass.     So as the Bible advises us, it is best to remember God and abandon attempts to mess around with things beyond our understanding. For anyone who has successfully astral projected, they should now be aware that there is a vast world that exists outside of the physical realmin confirmation of Gods Word-the Bible. And the Bible advises us on that as well. King Solomon, who wrote the book of Ecclesiastes, concluded by saying,     Now all has been heard;   here is the conclusion of the matter:   Fear God and keep his commandments,   for this is the whole duty of man.   For God will bring every deed into judgment,   including every hidden thing,   whether it is good or evil.     -- Ecclesiastes 12:13-14    If you are interested in this subject, you are probably seeking and searching for answers as to what life is and what life is all about. You are probably curious about the creation we live in and what is out there. The Bible tells us answers to many of lifes questions, such as, Why are we here?, What is the meaning of life?, and How did this all come about? You should know that God has a whole new world that he seeks to share with uswith you. The Bible teaches that there will come a day when Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead, and to reward those who obey Him with eternal life in this new world.      In Acts chapter 17 when the apostle Paul was in Athens, Greece about 2000 years ago, he spoke to a group of religious and spiritual people, people who wanted to know God, and told them:"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of h eaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. 'For in him we live and move and have our being...

Women are to submit to their husbands. That is about as far as romance in the Bible goes.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	The Bible says that it is forbidden before marriage.    Torah, Bible, Qur'an|`|a8kAassWaa	Although there are no references to the word romance in the Bible, there are 281 mentions of love. Since the dictionary definition for romance is "ardent emotional attachment or involvement between people; a love affair," these two terms can sometimes be used interchangeably. But the true meaning of love, as defined in the Bible, has been corrupted in the common usage of our English language and society. Most often, love is confused with infatuation - that elated, "high" feeling we get when we "fall in love." This kind of "love" is something that lasts typically a short time and, unless replaced by true love, results in broken relationships.    The Bible covers two types of love: agape and phileo. Agape love is represented by God's love for us. It is a non-partial, sacrificial love best demonstrated by the gift in John 3:16. "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life." This kind of love is unconditional. The "Love Chapter" in 1 Corinthians deals more explicitly with this. "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails" (1 Corinthians 13:4-8a). This passage is often quoted at weddings and other celebrations of love.    Agape is a connection through the spirit. A true manifestation of this requires a relationship with Christ. For without Him, agape love isn't exhibited in its truest form. We, as humans, can't reach this level alone. We need our Heavenly Father's Spirit in us, working through us. "The Spirit produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humility and self-control" (Galatians 5:22-23). Only through that Spirit can we reach this goal.    The other kind of love, phileo, is considered "brotherly love." It is usually based upon how others treat us and our feelings in any given situation. It involves direct interaction and sometimes comes with a price tag of expectation, wanting something back in return. It's a demonstrative form of love offered through the soul. But, it's also a command from God. "Let us love one another, because love comes from God" (1 John 4:7).  Love is the attribute of God that means the most to us. If God didn't love us, whom He created, He would have traded us in for a better model long ago. Despite our many failures, God keeps working with us (Romans 5:8). Time and time again, despite His patience being tested, He demonstrates that love for His people. He only banned Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. He didn't take their lives. He spared the world because He found one man of upright faith in Noah. He rescued Lot from Sodom before destroying that city. He made Abraham the father of many nations and blessed him with his long-awaited son, despite Abraham's impatience when he fathered a son through his wife's servant.    In the same way God shows His love for us, He expects us to love Him totally and to show love toward each other. "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself" (Luke 10:27). Jesus spoke these words when the Pharisees questioned Him about the greatest commandment of God. Although they tried to trick Him, Jesus didn't change the law; He fulfilled it. His sayings about love were not new. The emphasis was merely changed.  The relationships in our lives will either be governed by agape or phileo love. When thinking in terms of romance, we allow the manifestation of that agape love to pour out from our hearts. As a result, we are eager to do everything we can to please the other person and make that person happy. In a love relationship between a man and a woman, the romance is the physical evidence of the love that exists. When that relationship progresses to marriage, the love built between the man and woman only grows deeper as the bond is made stronger through the intimate union of body and soul. "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). Biblical love elevates the husband's affections for his wife to the point of loving his wife "as his own body." It also instructs wives to submit to their husbands as the head of the household (Eph. 5:25-29). But submission doesn't mean subservience. On the contrary, when true agape love is manifested in the marriage, the two will act as one, and both will love the other as they love themselves. The tenderness and romance will come out of that love.    By far, the best book in the Bible on this romantic and agape type of love is the Song of Solomon. An oft-quoted and many times favorite of romantics, this book demonstrates the parallel between the agape love Christ has for His church and the deep, abiding love a husband has for his bride. The lover and beloved exchange dialogue with each other, and the beloved speaks with her friends. Every passage attests to the deep and abiding love between the lover and beloved. The two are so consumed with that love that it fills them and gives them strength to face each new day. They find comfort and solace in each other's arms and are incomplete without each other. Being together excites them, and when they're apart, they anticipate their reunion.  But, above everything else that is demonstrated in God's Word, it's important to keep in mind that love/romance is an action. It's not passive, and it's not a feeling. It's a verb. It requires you to do something in order to bring it to pass. It also requires that you put the other person's wants and desires above your own. Whenever you need a reminder, go back and read 1 Corinthians |`|lYQDCJgeaa	"roadside confessor"  overlooks another kind of love that is portrayed in the Song of Songs: eros.  It is a natural part of human life--the "falling in love" part that draws men and women together and bonds them as phileos and agape grow.|`|z7aYNtojaa	Um... what do you mean? want to go a little further into that?|`|R4RsQxJEaa	The book of the Bible, "Song of Songs" is about romantic love.

The following are MASCULINE:    nouns ending in -age (except cage, image, page, plage and rage)    nouns ending in -ail, -eil, -euil    nouns ending in -ai, -oi, at    most nouns ending in -acle, -ge, -me, -, asme, isme    also days, months and seasons tend to be masculine    as do animals and also languages     The following are FEMININE:     nouns ending in -ance, -anse, -ence, and -ense (except le silence)    nouns ending in -sion and -tion    most nouns ending in -ie, -uie, -ire, -ine, ise    nouns ending in a double consonant followed by an unpronounced 'e' -elle, -enne, -esse, -ette    continents are often feminine     also fruits, countries and rivers ending in 'e'      Although there are several rules (as shown above) you'll mostly just have to look the word up in a dictionary to find out its gender. With plenty of practice you'll begin to remember them. Good luck with your language learning :)

About two hours into my first day on the job a very loud, unattractive, mean-acting woman walked into the store with her two kids, yelling obscenities at them all the way through the entrance.

The ugly woman stopped yelling long enough to say, "Hell no, they ain't twins. The oldest one's 9, and the other one's 7."  "Why the hell would you think they're twins? Are you blind, or just stupid?"  So I replied, "I'm neither blind nor stupid, Ma'am, I just couldn't believe you got laid twice. Have a good day and thank you for shopping at Wal-Mart."

I prayed and got no answers.  Truth is there is probably an afterlife and a life force.  I do believe we have spirits but religion is divorced from logic.  I admire Buddhists and Unitarians for putting logic back into religion.      Why do something because a book tells you to?  It has historical, spiritual and cultural value but it is not the word of God.  People claim that Ezekiel saw aliens.  I figure he either had epilepsy or schizophrenia.      Mohammed hallucinated, possibly due to the traditional use of hashish and khat in Saudi Arabia.  That and maybe because he had sleep apnea and psychopathic delusional tendencies.|`|I5LaDqe3aa	Back then, even the Sun revolved around the Earth.  (And it was made to stand still at least once.)|`|U8QQkeQ4aa	I believe that the bible suggests that the Earth was the center of the Universe....and most astronomers had believed but many cultures have also known, such as Mayans, that the moon revolved around the Earth...and they did not have the same science and the Eastern world.     If one were to understand the Bible literally, it would be hard to suggest that the earth revolves around the sun. The church fathers believed that the Bible teaches a geocentric universe. Modern astronomy has shown such an interpretation of   the Bible to be incorrect. Most Christians, therefore, have accepted that the earth revolves around the sun, in order to   avoid the idea that God is deceptive in His Creation. It would be good if we approached all scientific discovery the same way.       Joshua 10:13  And the Sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people   had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written  in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of  heaven, and hastened not to go down about a whole day.    1 Chronicles 16:30: He has fixed the earth firm,  immovable.    Psalm 93:1: Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm  ...    Psalm 96:10: He has fixed the earth firm, immovable  ...    Psalm 104:5: Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so   that it never can be shaken.    Isaiah 45:18: ...who made the earth and fashioned it, and   himself fixed it fast...      Ecclesiastes 1:5: The sun also ariseth, and the sun   goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. Psalm 104:19 Thou hast made the moon to mark the seasons;   the sun knows its time for setting.    1 Esdras 4:34  The earth is vast, and heaven is high,   and the sun is swift in its course, for it makes the circuit  of the heavens and returns to its place in one day.|`|3b592d2cb161619b043cacf776619609aa	I don't get it?

They thought that the earth was flat and so is was the sun for them that revolves around the static earth  and so with the moon. God knows that it will be learned scientifically and even he said how it was to the early man, they may have a hard time understanding it. Learning as life goes on is a part of creation. Had man been as intelligent as now maybe the world has long been gone because of his irresponsibility and stupidity.|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	When they wrote the bible most people of those days thought the world was flat even most who wrote the scriptures. Just because God inspired men to write the word of God dose not mean they understood. In Acts chapter 1 the Jews were still asking Jesus if He was going to restore the kingdom back to Israel (Act 1:6  When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel)? Even when Jesus told them, that His kingdom was not of this world! (Joh 18:36  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence). They were looking for an earthly kingdom, the same as those of today who think that the kingdom Of Christ is to be here on earth in Jerusalem. They did not under stand the scriptures and neithed do many today.|`|mSFjbetxaa	LMAO!!!!!    Fundie, they did not know.

Such records are the words of men, not very holy men, and they are not the word of God. The Scriptures always have, and always will, reflect the intellectual, moral, and spiritual status of those who create them. Have you not noted that the concepts of Yahweh grow in beauty and glory as the prophets make their records from Samuel to Isaiah? And you should remember that the Scriptures are intended for religious instruction and spiritual guidance. They are not the works of either historians or philosophers.

None of the people who wrote the Bible ever heard God speak the words they wrote.  How do I know this?   Because God speaks in Spirituality, and spirituality cannot be found in any realm of existence other than in the realm of Neutral Spiritual Energy, or that of God.    Even in the next inner realm , which is the Astral realm, there is direct Esoteric communication between ones own Apapsyche [Operational Energy of ones Soul] and that of another.  No writing and no speaking.    So the words in the Bible are Man attempting to convey an Esoteric Spiritual Reality  that  cannot be conveyed in written language.

Of course, the ancient Greeks, who were around about 1000 years before Christ, already knew that and had even calculated the circumference of the earth with remarkable accuracy, based upon shadown lengths at the same time of day in two different locations.     But the writers of the Bible would NEVER plagerize, would they?? (Sarcasm, in case you missed it. Because Jesus is a plagerized version of Horus and many other pre-existing gods.)

If you were unaware of what was happening, and this person took advantage of you without your wits about you and you don't find men sexually attractive I would say your not gay.     Beating a person up doesn't make you gay nor does it not make you gay. If you were sexually assaulted when you were drunk is one thing to be angry about, but if you were willing and aware then you need to come to terms with what you did and accept it. You cannot get angry at the other person if you wanted were a willing participant.     If you have sexual feelings for men it's a bad idea to pretend you don't, it will make you a very angry person and if you get married and pretend you aren't it's going to be a horrible thing to do to a woman and kids if you ever have them.|`|V2IJHt94aa	Whip me, beat me make me your *****....yeah you are still gay|`|Rt0e1eEeaa	If you beat him up then you are evil and a criminal and you WILL be sent to jail.|`|AJeaWX8Paa	It makes you a royal asshole

AA10024451	Your only obligation is to be respectful to your siblings, yet firm in your resolve to refrain from any involvement in the birthday celebration. You need to explain that to her as well. If she has any love for Jehovah, she will need to explain that to your siblings and that because of that love she will not have anything to do with any birthday celebration. If she's weakening in her resolve, have her discuss it with the congregation elders. But from your side, make it known to your siblings that a birthday party is not wanted and neither of you will have any part of it.|`|Y9GRLyajaa	Im sorry Debbie but did you think Yahoo Answer is the best place for ask about this.

Well now things are different, you may talk with her about why she is going this and why now she want to celebrate a BD, and if she doesnt understand and if you really a JW then you will know what you should do and who you may talk, umm, there is a book that in a chapter talk about the form of act in situations like this, if you a JW you will know which book is that.|`|jbKQZVkhaa	There are no rules, we can do whatever we feel our conscience will allow based on our bible training. For example: I dont take blood fractions but some brothers and sisters may. It is your (and your mums) reationship with Jehovah that matters.

Should we not do it all year around?|`|AA10472482	Obviously, you love your mother AND you both love Jehovah.    Telling the elders is not for the purpose of getting anyone in trouble, but to help her.     I would guess based your statement of her faithfulness that she is not wanting to do something she knows is wrong, but rather perhaps due to her age some of the things she knows (has known?) are beginning to slip from her mind. As I said, just a guess.    Jehovah has put the elders there to help us - go to them for the help they can provide, and of course go to Jehovah in prayer, by yourself and with your Mother.|`|1B8zf7J2aa	Preface:  I'm very sensitive to gray areas, if there are any, but this one is cut and dry.  Pretend that you have to make your case about birthdays and the non celebration principles which we abide by to a householder or a bible study. If this goes through under your watch, you no longer have the freedom of speech to talk about such things in these two instances. If you are the principle care giver, then you should step in and say no, & inform the elders, creating a support wall-and reason with your mother that if she is sentimental, then wouldn't she rather have millions of years of memories in the new system than throw it away in the old system possibly by starting with this to be on the wrong side of Jehovah's favor?  Worldlings use the word "only" a lot to coerce people into wrong doing.  "It's *only* a dollar that I found on this man's property, it's *only* a pinch of incense that I throw on the altar to not be eaten by a lion...What harm could that be? I can go on worshiping Jah right after...  If she is baptized, then she knows perfectly well what is proper in Jehovah's eyes. Remember in the Biblical examples two people died at birthday parties.  Thank you very much for the question, and I hope this helps.  -And yes, Jehovah knows best.|`|ZL4HQn49aa	It's a difficult situation your in Debb.  If you have talked to you mom and she won't listen to you then you will have to go to the older men in the congregation, the elders. I really feel for you. It's never an easy task to go to the elders but Jehovah wants his congregation to remain clean. If you can't reason with her hopefully the elders will be able to, and it's up to her heart and Jehovah as to the outcome. You'll be in my prayers. As far as your question about nostalgia making us turn against what we know is right, there is a dear sister in my old congergation, she is 90 and she doesn't remember anything except for the turth. There is no question in her mind as to what is right and wrong and she always does whats right despite being the only one in her family in the truth. Also keep in mind the faithful men of old such as Abraham, Issac, and Jacob. Despite their old age they never turned away from Jehovah.|`|bW4RET0Waa	My first thought is if she understands what the rest of the family is wanting from her. Does she have times of dementia? If so, I'd tell the elders anyway and maybe they can be there when some other family member is so they can see if your mom is seeing it correctly. Maybe an elder can be there and talk with her before any family is there. Hard to arrange but worth the try. Jehovah will be with you for it.     A hard call sister, I'll pray for you and your mom.|`|8YPENuRhaa	i think that you should tell the elders. this way they can talk to your mother and siblings explaining why she shouldn't celebrate her birthday.

When things like happen to me I firstly seek jehovah's advice. Have you tried that as yet. If so you are to be encouraged that Jehovah has heard you. Lets remind ourselves of the origin of celebrating a birthday was to celebrate the birth a pagan god. We are not to have any other god before Jah. If we celebrate any of the festivities of the world we are thus worshiping these gods. Im sure your mom will not want to be guilty of that. Also you said she goes to meetings all the time. Obviously she is going through something. maybe her faith is weakening. Remember she is 80. she's seen alot of years come and go and still no paradise. She needs encouragement. This is a test from satan in his efforts knowing that he has a short period of time. Also he preys on the weak. Please encourage my dear sister. I can't stand to loose another relative in the faith to this wicked world. Take care and let me know how it goes.|`|rg4lS9E9aa	if possable have an elder talk to her before the party takes place.ask her why with the end so close would she want to jeapardize her relationship with Jehovah.remind her that it is  a test from satan and you don't want her to fail.|`|TLLklriUaa	You have every right to choose not to attend if it goes against your religious beliefs.

You'll feel so much better. Sometimes we get caught up in a situation emotionally and we don't know what to do. Then there's that one person that can give you a little nudge. Here's your little nudge Debbie.    You're in my prayers tonight. So is your mom. :)|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	My Mom turned 80 two years ago. She is not a Witness. But she studied many moons ago and still reads the literature quite frequently and we get into a good discussion now and then. She even told me that if she went on Millionaire she would make sure I was on the list for the "religious" questions.    None of my younger brothers and sisters are Witnesses. Although again they have all studied a little in their growing up years.    They were planning a surprise birthday party for her. And it was really a little more than a birthday party. My Mom had been a professional musician in her life, and they were inviting several persons that she had worked with, etc. (She wrote songs, recorded records and was a regular on a TV program). It was a commemoration of her career.    So of course, my brothers and sisters wanted me to be there. But I told them I could not. I reminded them that I had been a Witness for 50 years and Mom knew very well why I would not attend. Of course the efforts to persuade were pulled out - how this would upset Mom and others, etc. But I said there was no changing my Bible beliefs.    I told them that Mom knew how much I loved her and that I showed my love for her by doing other things for her, some my choice and some at her request.    About a month after the event, I visited my Mom. And after several hours into the visit, she mentioned that my sister had found a website of the old performers and she gave me a couple "publicity shots" and a copy of one of her records. And that was it. No harsh words. No sad feelings. On either side. My Mom fully understood.    The fact that you and your Mom are in the same household does put the situation in a different light. Think about that. How would you react if it were Christmas or Easter, or Halloween. What if there were card games with money? Or any number of other situations that may only be observable from within the home? Thinking about those and what you would do may help you to think about this situation.    Do you think that her thoughts of her mortality may be setting in? And this might be a reaction to this? Sort of one "last ditch" effort to see everyone? Not that it is an excuse, but that may be the rationale in her mind, rather than a "real" birthday party. Perhaps in her mind, that is what is needed to get THEM there. To see her.     Just a thought.    EDIT: No, but aging does seem to affect some people to go back to what they did earlier in life. That is the reason that altzheimers sufferers go back to memories from so far back and can't remember what happened 5 minutes ago.    I'm not implying at all that your mother is anything near altzheimers. But I bring that out to show that the mind can and does do funny things when some people get older.    I'm sending an email.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Jehovah certainly knows best and since you know all the details already about birthdays,  Think of the 3 young Hebrews out in Babylon taken from their parents and all alone. .When the horn blew all were to rise and worship the statue of gold,this is not a statue of gold,but it is still a test and  it is your test. Read the account  Daniel 3:8-30   t it will give you strength.You know that there were other Hebrews there with the 3 youths,probably friends and family.Can you see them poking fun and mocking at the boys? But they had resolved in their heart to serve Jehovah.    What were their words?  17. If it is to be our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us,out of the burning fiery furnace and out of your hand,oh King he will rescue us.But if not let it be known to you oh King that your God's are not the ones we are serving,and the image of gold you have set up we will not worship.    Your mother it seems want praise for herself and before she goes through with it you should talk to the elders and let them know what is going on.     You have to remember that since she is 80 years old maybe her mental faculties are slipping ,the elders will be able to discern this.They will be able to give you strength also in your time of need.And in a few months from now it will all be forgotten.  Philea'  Numbers 6:24,25|`|AA11025703	If your Mother Wants the party, and is in her right mind, then ultimatley it's up to her.    You probably should just bow out gracefully.  Not bother to help or support the party, but leave her to make her own choices.    I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Hmmm  Celebrate how? The same way as the world does with gifts etc.?    A birthday celebration honors the person who has the anniversary of their birth on that day. Since this is restricted to close family members only, there might be some consideration to the fact that we are told to honor our parents. Honor your father and your mother in order that your days may prove long upon the ground that Jehovah your God is giving you." Exodus 20:12    So is this to be a birthday celebration in the worldly sense or is it unique in the way it will take place and in it's purpose? Unique enough that all could feel comfortable being there if they were Witnesses?    You don't mention your father so I would assume he has passed away or ...[whatever]?  When both parents are alive for many years we will often honor them with a family get together on their wedding anniversary and even give them gifts expressing our gratitude for what great parents they have been over the years. We may even throw them a party and invite many friends that they had over the years especially on a notable anniversary like their 50th.  Perhaps your mother would appreciate such an event and misses it now that Dad is no longer around? Why not celebrate a family day that coincides with what was their anniversary or some other day that would be suitable. Maybe the day that marks the anniversary of your mother's baptism?     My parents are 83 years old this year and I have noticed how in recent years that the family getting together as a group has come to be more important to them than ever. They really treasure that. They have been married for 63 years on January 25th, just over a week ago.   Oh and today I am 62, but don't tell anybody, OK?    Is it wrong to eat turkey on the last Thursday of November? Is it wrong to honor your mother on her birthday? If only family members are there, it's not like the world might do it where they would invite friends and others etc. If there are no party hats and no decorations and no cake with candles on it... Again, it is not like the world would do it. Jehovah reads hearts and he knows our motives and judges accordingly but we must also be careful not to be a cause for stumbling.  So much to consider. For instance, since your siblings are not in the truth they would likely bring gifts [not necessarily a bad thing], gifts wrapped in birthday wrapping paper and and birthday cards instead of generic "I Love You Mom" cards. This would surely contribute to making the event distasteful to you and possibly or hopefully even to Mom. Discuss this with Mom and perhaps if it is decided that a get together would be in order that Mom could lay down some rules.|`|WN4gHMLQaa	I think that Jehovah's witness should not stop you from  celebrating anything, I think it is completely stupid not to celebrate something that is definitely wroth celebrating...think about what you believe, why do you believe it...etc.|`|C9nOqOZKaa	Im not a JW, however, I know from some JW (and a sister who converted) that they do not celebrate birthdays because God and JC never celebrated this pagan festivity (Herodes celebrated his wife's b-day and she asked him the head of John the Baptist as present, so it's said).    Your obligation as JW your siblings already know, and if you dont go, your mom will understand as well.  I suppose they know you dont celebrate anything that is pagan in the teachings of JW, and that includes Bdays, Xmas, Easter, etc.    You can visit your mom on that day just to make her feel special, for you still have responsibility with your mom as u mature, just make sure she doesnt think or believe that you are there to celebrate her birthday but that you are there for a regular visit for a few min so to avoid being sucked into the "party"|`|8Ddi57v2aa	You know guys, I honestly can't recall where Jesus said a "birthday" is a sin.  But I do remember Jesus saying, "Love your God with all your soul, all your might, and all your mind.  And the second is like the first, love your neighbor as yourself."  Love is too great a reason to worry about a innocent birthday get together where there will be no unforgivable sin committed.    I don't think President Barak Obama is going to outlaw birthday get together's so no crime committed.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	If I was in your position I wouldn't shoulder this responsibility on your own. Sit your mum down & explain to her that you won't be able to bear this alone & you'll have to share it with another JW (preferably an elder) If she's mad at you, tell her that it would affect your conscience too much for you to keep it to yourself.  You could always try to reason with her that she's been in the truth for over 34 years & that if she goes against what she knows is right in Jehovah's eyes just for one day's celebration, that her conscience will be affected for a lot longer after the day is finished.  And also point out that those in your family (no matter how well-meaning they seem) are not really giving respect to your mum by pressuring her to compromise her beliefs in this way.|`|332vXA6oaa	I believe the Bible sums it up very clearly. He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me. and he that has greater affection for son or daughter than me is not worthy of me. Mathew 10 : 37 .

" Our marriage partner can betray us, our sons and daughters can betray us, our mother and father can betray us, our best friend can betray us, but Jehovah and Jesus will never betray us."|`|0l1ZairMaa	Oh, Debbie,  this must be truly hard for you.  Not that you want to participate, but the fact that your mom being an active witness, actually wants to go along with this celebration.   You didn't mention if your siblings were also in the truth.  If that is the case,  why would they want to do something like this?  Your mom isn't suffering from dementia is she?    Debbie, it must to be hard for you to go to the elders, but Leviticus 5:1 says that if we witness a bad deed being done, that it is our obligation to go and report it.  I'm so sorry that this is happening to you Sister...I truly, truly am. ~sigh~|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	He that is faithful in what is least is also faithful in what is great  thats in the bible.    As a Jehovahs wittness myself , I would not use things like 'nostaligia' for an excuse to take part in a pagan celebration.    Your mom needs counseling from the elders to correct her wrong thinking. We all get of course sometimes and need a swift kick in the pants to bring us back to reality.    If you are a JW too you , you know what they are planning on doing and it is your responsbilty to go to the elders and let them know.    If your mom has bible studies what is she teaching them? That is is okay the 'bend the rules' once in awhile?    I know you might be afraid of back lash from your mom and maybe yoru siblings but didnt Jesus say he didnt come to bring peace but to cause division between mother and son  mother and law and daughter etc..  This could be a test for YOU,  remember    Proverbs 27:11 "Be wise my son that I make a reply to the one taunting me"    Satan is watching to see what you do, do the right thing and talk to the elders so that you are not guilty in anyway before Jehovah.    ESPECIALLY with all the info that is comming out right now , we are in the last moments of this system if your mom cant see that we need to continue to walk in intergrity...    have courage do not fear earthling man but Jehovah you can do it|`|HItbioaMaa	Why do family members take it upon themselves to decide what's good for others? Because, that's where their heart lies; and that's okay for them, but, just as we as Christians do not impose our beliefs on others, the same should apply to well-meaning family members also. You should approach those that initiated this party and find out why they would do such a thing. Remind them that your mother served Jehovah faithfully all these years, and ask why on earth would they want to ruin the memory of those years for their own selfish reasons. Ask this of your mother also. We are so close to the end of the wickedness we see all around us. We must do everything possible to prevent Satan from causing us to think like some here who've said things like "She's 80; give her a break and let her party". I hope you can convince everyone involved that this is not in her best interests, so both of you can remain faithful through the end! Agape, and please let us know how this works out.

6y29MTyyaa	Uh, a hippie is more of a cultural stereotype -- a laid-back, promiscuous, very liberal drug user.  Depending on whom you ask, the hippies were a cultural phase in the late 60's or a general stereotype that's still around today.  Thing is, a lot of the original 60's hippies grew up, put on suits and joined the rest of rat race.  So people might disagree on what a "hippie" is today.    "Radical" is a lump term for anyone with an extreme political viewpoint, with generally violent rhetoric.    Beyond the crudest comparions that A) both terms are loosely related to political views and B) they're human, the two terms have little in common.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Differences and similarities:    Hippies are usually more laid back, we want it done, just can't get the motivation to do it man - but I give it to the 60s hippies they got a lot done and a nation changed because of their movement    Hippies tend to be more peace and love, while I feel that radicals tend to feel they need to do whatever is necessary to get the point across    We both get worked up about issues, but radicals usually take it farther        Those are what I could think off the top of my head|`|0QqK4Gyraa	All hippies are radicals, not all radicals are hippies.

The Polish army was told that the German tanks were made of wood instead of steel. They were told this because the German army did train in wooden mock-ups. However, because of this misleading information, the Polish army use horse cavalry to attack the German army and were subsequently nearly wiped out. After that the "Pollack" jokes started and hadn't let up.

They hang out to ghettos and they have absolutely no intentions to try to fit in the Irish way to life. They are famous for coming into the country, work and spend 95% of their money back to Poland... in other words, not contributing to the country itself.    When Irish people work in Poland, they get heavily discriminated and barriers just form... No one who is non-polish and worked in Poland ever came back being happy with the people...    Hatred forms when people are selfish... so, it not that they are Polish... it's it fact that they are selfish in general...

You're led to believe he has some low intensive secret to avoid lots of hard work.  Classic!      "Know why they call it the American Dream? Cause you have to be asleep to believe it....."   George Carlin (RIP) 1980's       Its the same BS today as yesteryear, though the term "american dream" came from historian and writer James Truslow Adams, who coined the phrase "American Dream" in his 1931 book Epic of America:     "The American Dream is that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position."

This was a disaster as over four million people in Ireland depended on the potato as their chief food. The blight returned in 1846 and over the next year an estimated 350,000 people died of starvation and an outbreak of typhus that ravaged a weaken population. Despite good potato crops over the next four years, people continued to die and in 1851 the Census Commissioners estimated that nearly a million people had died during the Irish Famine. The British administration and absentee landlords were blamed for this catastrophe by the Irish people|`|I5LaDqe3aa	Because the English were meaner.  Around 1600, the English defeated and scattered the Irish nobility and took control of the entire country.  They began to bleed the country dry, basically by ruling it with English landlords who were given the Irish land.  The landlords demanded so much  be given them that the Irish could eat little or none of the livestock that they raised; that went to the landlords.  The Irish became almost completely dependent on the potato for their nourishment, as the potato was easy and cheap to grow and the crops were large.  Unfortunately, Europeans had only imported one type of potato from America, in spite of the fact that there were many to choose from in South America, and this type was struck with blight in the 1840's.  The Irish began to starve to death and the English government did little or nothing to help them for quite some time.  The Irish began to emigrate to the U.S. in vast numbers, not knowing what a harsh reality they would find there, but they at least had a chance at success and freedom.|`|q9PVawNyaa	Leannain: I'm not sure what version of Irish history they taught you but it's complete bull. I am Irish (Irish Irish not American Irish) and I have a degree in history. Why would Protestant England seek Papal approval?    To answer the question:     The potato famine was a catalyst in Irish emigration but not the main cause. The blight in late 1840s saw many being left with no food source and the option was emigrate or starve. The British parliament were out of touch and didn't realise how much the Irish depended on the potatoes (they simply didn't know, it wasn't an issue of spite). When they finally did realise they sent aid but it wasn't enough. If you are ever in Ireland you will actually find some roads that lead nowhere (very rare nowadays, most were incorporated into the road network). These were known as famine roads and were commissioned by the British to give work to the poverty stricken Irish so that they could afford basic rations.    Even before the famine emigration was common and not just to the US but to the UK, Canada and Australia (there was also seaonal migration to Scotland at harvest time). Many of the people in Ireland were small famers often with an acre or less of land (conacre). These would often emigrate hoping for something better and when they got there they would be too proud to admit it was a mistake and sent home letters saying how wonderful America was and how they had become wealthy. This then encouraged others to follow them over unsuspecting of what actually waited for them.|`|mNZCMuSpaa	potato famine.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	The potatoe famine|`|EMYImof1aa	they were starving to death because of the potato famine and the english government was oppressing them, so they escaped to the new world in hopes of finding work and freedom and food|`|RgymoiIQaa	Was it not for the purpose of obtaining a better life?

Claiming papal approval the British invaded Ireland, seized the land, punished the inhabitants (penal laws) and drove them into the west (to hell or Connaught)     The reason the Irish starved during the potato blight was because the English forbade them to keep any other crops.    Look around the world today at every trouble spot African continent, middle east and the British had a hand in mucking it up

While it is true there are programs for families to help them understand, the general public is not aware of any beneficial programs.     Understanding is the key to awareness & compassion. Unless disability touches someones life, they are likely to perceive the disability through a lens of stereotype due to this being promoted in popular culture.     Education benefits friends//family when it is available to them. Unfortunately, some families refuse to seek assistance-they see asking for help as a form of weakness. Many times they are not informed of all agencies available to help. Cost can be a prohibitive factor. Many small cities don't have programs/access to needed professionals.Travel can be darn near impossible in certain cases.     The general public is the source of much misconception and hurtful statements/actions twd PWD.

Please visit     www.Self-injury.net      Other thoughts:      "Triggers for self-harm can include bullying, bereavement, pressure at work, abuse, financial problems, pressure to fit in and relationship problems. When these pressures pile up, people can find it difficult to cope. Some say that they feel things are out of control.    One sufferer said: 'I think control's a big thing. You can't control what's happening around you, but you can control what you do to yourself.'    Self-harm is often linked to feelings of self-hatred and depression and appears more common in women than men. Experts suggest this may be because men find it easier to express emotions like anger in an outward way or take it out on others. Some people find it difficult to give up the behavior despite realizing that it could be life-threatening and is not rational" (BBC News - medical report).|`|RXS9K18Faa	don't worry i know what are going through.

If you can't do that then you need to  TELL someone that you're doing it, and they would most likely have to take you to a hospital, because if you cannot control yourself from self harm, you need to be in a hospital. Is that what you want? Most likely not, so you get control of yourself and you stop.    Now, as for the way you are feeling, you are depressed. You need to talk to a psychologist to sort out your feelings.     You need to first tell your parents, then you need to see your doctor and he or she will find a person that will be able to further help you with your issues. There is nothing wrong with talking to people about your problems, lot's of people do it.    Here are some resources for you:    Information about depression and how to help yourself:  http://www.depression.com  http://www.webmd.com/depression    Self harm recovery:  http://www.thesite.org/healthandwellbein...|`|e7gkttgcaa	dude...thats not an excuse to hurt yourself    ..i felt the way you did and I turned to heroin for 2 months|`|PpKJIT0aaa	All attack is a cry for help.    You've taken the first step and said that you need it. Now take the second and talk to Samaritans or the suicide hotline. It is the biggest, best and bravest thing you can do for yourself, and will in time, lead you out of your tunnel of darkness and shame.|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	Take a rubber band and put it around your wrist.  Anytime you get the urge to cut snap it really, really hard against your arm.  It hurts like a mother, and will help stop the urge to cut.  That's just a quick fix though, you need to get help from a professional because there are obviously very deep issues you need to work on.  Even if it's just a school counselor, you need to talk to someone.  Good luck, and please be careful.|`|H1DrMEZxaa	I used to cut all the time.  I was majorly addicted so I know what you mean when you say it is hard to stop.  Basically I just told myself that I needed to stop doing this.  I started avoiding situations that got me down or made me want to cut again.  Sometimes I would start again though.  I recently went to see a psychiatrist (through my school).  They diagnosed me with bi-polar.  I know this seems like it might not relate to you.  But my point is I guess, that everyone is different.  The first thing to do though (and it sounds like you've already done it) is to decide that you don't want this to be a part of your life.  Then you've got to figure out what makes you want to cut.  And then you've got to figure out if you are the type of person who is able to deal with this problem on your own, or if you need to tell a friend, family member, or even just go see a therapist.|`|YBcGxCKUaa	ooohhhhh well try to find other hobbies or activities to keep you busy. That way you will be to busy to cut. I have never cut, but when I get sad which is quite often I usually just sleep or listen/play music.   You have fallen in to a bad habbit that will hopefully end soon. I know you feel. I don't want to be either most of the time.   I'm not gonna suggest speaking to someone unless that's something you actually want to do. Do you like to talk it out. I personnally like to keep quiet, and I wouldn't see much good in speaking with a guidance counsellor who I will probably dislike.|`|vs5YwpzWaa	Okay,  Take a deep breath. Just relax. I know it's hard to believe but your not alone. You got your family and teachers, and maybe even some people at school.    Do an internet search for some suicide hot lines. They will be a nice voice to talk to. And they are really good at listening.    If you like to have a face-to-face talk. Pop into a teacher's office tomorrow. They are trained on how to help with this.    Also even though its hard to do, you may want to tell your parents. It's scary as hell to do, but trust me once they're on your side they'll go to bat for you every time.     When you get the thoughts about cutting, DON'T pick up a glass. Instead pick up the phone. Either call a hot line or a friend. Have they help you talk yourself down.    I know when I get down on myself I go for a run, crank the music, and just run. Try doing something you really love to get your mind off it. Whether it's running, drawing, dancing, whatever, just don't cut.    The only other advise I have is ask for help. Which you already have done. :) Keep it up you're doing the right thing by not cutting.     And keep us posted, the LGBT forum doesn't want to loss anyone. :)|`|5cCIDpGfaa	Just realize that the longer you do it, the longer it takes to stop.     We are crazy people who like to hurt ourselves. I mean, think about it. There are people out there being abused and people like you and I are hurting ourselves on purpose. I've never been able to understand that. How can someone like pain?     It's been a month since I last cut myself, and it has been a hard month. I've started scratching myself and hitting myself which is just as bad but I haven't cut yet.  It's hard, it's really hard.   It's an adiction just like drugs or alcohol.    If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.|`|c8qgyBgsaa	I cut. So i know exactly how you feel. I would say get help while you are ahead. It will get worse and worse. It's just not worth it. I know how hard it is to quit. I tried and tried i went like 3 weeks and i couldn't take it anymore. So i definatley know what you mean. You never think it's that big of a deal. You need to get help. Talk to a conselour or teacher or parent. Someone that will understand. Lifes to short to be sad all the time. One way to help is to put a rubber band around your wrist and snap it whenever you feel like cutting yourself. Try to think of happier things. Try staying away from sad things that would cause yourself to cut. I know its hard. I know exactly what its like. I still do it. I just can't stop. I really hope you get better(:

WE in latin america have a saying that goes something like this.  "The Right to be Respected, among individuals and among nations, such peace will be endured"    In the WEstern world mentality, everything is becoming politized, politically correct.  Cartoons not always hit the target (make pple smile), sometimes they offend other groups.  For example, a cartoon could be funny for you for offensive to others.  The Mexican govt, issued a postal stamp a few years ago, and the postal stamp character was Memin PInguin (a Mexican black cartoon boy).  THE NCAA was appalled and demanded the US govt to boicot that postal stamp, saying it offends the african american ppl.  The end result was that the Mex. govt. stopped the Memin Pinguin postal stamp circulation.    Your question is addressed with malice for you know that the cartoon you are drawing is targetted to a group and that group's dignity will be damage with your malice, no matter where you intent to print it out.  Thus, your cartoon's intent is not to make us laugh and smile but hurt a particular group.    What should your "punishment" be?

But in the business sense the people of Yahoo! seem to exaggerate the importance of it.  We would conduct business with them in English, because outside of China it is not spoken as much as other languages.  The culture and the sheer number of speakers make it important.  It would look great on an application too, but honestly in the business world you will not be using it to the extent that some will say on here. Don't get me wrong it is an important language, but the way the language is set up it would be a huge inconveniance and highly unlikely that it would ever become a global language.|`|fVTNgewKaa	I've taken Chinese for two and a half years and I'm still wondering why it's supposedly such an important language. Most Chinese people would rather speak to you in English anyway, and find it charming and quaint that you speak a little of their language. So, I'd still say that it is a good and neighborly deed to learn a little Mandarin, but there's very little reason to learn it fluently unless you're married to a Chinese person or have a passion for Chinese culture.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	Mandarin is a silly word to call Chinese language...    well, Italian is also useless anywhere outside Italy, same happens with German and Swedish... nevertheless people are learning them... history, culture, business, there are factors that attract people to China... cooperation with Chinese partners from abroad is also easier with the language knowledge...    actually nobody forces you to learn it... you decide what is important for you...

egBy7RqOaa	yes vampires and werewolves are indeed real. although im not sure about the witches thing though.    i am a vampire and a lot of my friends are too. but let it be known that vampires and werewolves aren't the typical types that you read about in books or see in movies we are more 'normal' than that if you will.    we don't sleep in coffins-we sleep in beds  we eat normal food  we drink normal beverages  we don't have 'special powers'  we are not immortal  our senses are slightly sharper though.  we don't burn or die in sunlight, we get headaches or migraines.    for more information email me ill be glad to help.       hope i helped.  vote best answer please?|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	no they are not|`|jBYxEX8taa	Yes, they are.

They know they aren't immortal, can go out during the day, and they don't live in caves or coffins. Therians, sanguinarians, and psy's are real. The only thing is that Hollywood got to the masses first and screwed the real people over. Now, there are teenage role players everywhere.|`|k4DxnbMCaa	I think it's just superstition. Nobody has ever created an eyewitness account of one of those creatures. Deep belief in some of those creatures (such as witches), may lead to paranoia, which the Salem witch trials have proved so eloquently.|`|jLL7sDILaa	Witches = yes. Witches cannot just say a word and do something amazing, though. They're just normal people who believe that personal Will can influence the world.    Vampires = I believe so. I am one.    Werewolves = maybe.|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	Vampires ARE real, but they're nothing like the media portrays them. Vampirism is something you are born with. Genetic, I believe. However, one is not aware of it until age 15-16. No superpowers or anything. They are technincally human, yes humans, that have an energy deficiency and have to get 'extra' energy from someone else. There's the psychic kind, which feed on a person's energy. There's also the actually blood drinkers that get the it from donors. They can be beautiful, but it depends on genetics, just like any other human. They can be strong, but they have to work at it, they like any other human. They don't have a phobia of garlic or anything. Get the point?    I wouldn't know about werewolves... but who knows? They could.    As for witches, of course they exist! it mainly depends on what you would define as a witch, though. One who pratices magic? Witchcraft? Or the Halloween-type ones?|`|rh1p29Praa	Well, you see if you haven't seen one then they are not real. Imagine what would happen when humans find an alien or aliens living on earth...... It would be the same way if they found a real vampire or a werewolf.... There would be  havoc....(scientists would wanna know how there body works.... and for sure it would be in the media and the News all over the world) And all the proofs ppl give you to prove that they are real and all those fake pictures and stories they show you could be just made on a computer or they could be totally FAKE....  And no offence ppl who think (they) are vampires or werewolfs or witches who think they can do magical stuff...are just ... lets just say they have problems.|`|anfhcnWeaa	vampires are real we are not the monsters that we  are portrayed as in movies and books we are not immortal we can come out in the daytime   we can't turn other people into vampires so dont even ask me.    as for witches i do believe they real     and werewolves i dont believe they can actually turn into monstrous beasts during a full moon though i do believe that they are affected by the light and phases of the moon in ways more emotional then physical.|`|kA14rQvXaa	you been thinking about twilight too much have you?|`|OrE9yA9baa	yeah, and santa's gonna be bringing the girls gone wild movie to horny 6 year old.

Wicca, and other branches of Paganism, are very old Earth-based religions which are still practiced by some people today. Wiccans are not evil, as so many people think, and do not worship the devil. They don't even believe in a devil. Rather, they try to respect the earth, and every person living in it. They are a very peaceful people, and do not believe in harming anyone.    To be honest, the Wiccans I know are a lot kinder than some of the so-called "Christians" I know. There is a social stigma against most non-Christians, especially Pagans, which is honestly not fair at all, considering how long they've been hunted down and persecuted only because they are the minority.    Wiccans are normal, kind people, who live normal lives.

wvJxtmJTaa	Lol No. If shes a TRUE lesbian there is no possible way. BUT if she a supposed lesbian..and she has sex with a guy she is bi sexual if she has sex with women also|`|D1BNSf5uaa	No.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I know of quite a few lesbian-identified women who fell in love with men, and a couple of lesbian-identified women who have found their sexualities shifting naturally to men.    People don't like to admit it, because then people try to exploit it (i.e. saying that there's no such thing as a real lesbian, that it's unnatural, etc.), but there is a minority of women who used to be lesbian and who currently are straight-identified.    Now, let me caution you: NOBODY CAN CHANGE THEIR SEXUALITY.  NOBODY.  AT ALL.  People's sexuality can change, but we don't yet know how or why.  Nobody can consciously choose to go from lesbian to straight, so you better forget about it.|`|Dkylapi6aa	no i think the people that can "turn" straight were never gay in the first place.|`|7wqIJbPjaa	you can for a little while maybe confuse her or convince her straight for a day or two, but then the feelings return and she's gay again....so wait...that means i lied. no, sorry.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Nope.

ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	Wanga dolls are a bit iffy -- there's no real tradition behind them, and I only know of one website that sells them: a commercial site that also sells spells and magical supplies with bizarre characteristics, like the "Valentine's Day Money Spell."    The dolls themselves are very traditional and I've heard many people report their effectiveness. For example, I knew a girl who was cursed by someone hiding a tiny one in the lining of her purse -- it was years before she identified the problem.    Doll Babies, or "Voodoo Dolls" as they are more commonly called, have a variety of magical uses. Purposewise, they are used as a stand-in for an actual person on whom a spell is being worked, and are not themselves inherently used for evil. They are generally used in a symbolic way that is representative of the sort of effect the practitioner wishes to produce upon their human target. In previous times, they were a virtual necessity for any sort of influencing or commanding spells; however, the advent of photography has put them somewhat on the decline, since photographs are typically cheaper and easier to use. The doll baby still holds a certain place in magic, however; for it is a time-tested and traditional working of the oldest sort. A curse is known from Ancient Egypt in which practitioners would make up such a doll, and after covering it in magical writings it would be wrapped up and thrown into a fire. The ashes would be mixed with dung, and it would then be burnt a second time.|`|E9chZY74aa	The power is in God, not dolls.|`|AA11785285	about as well as macaroni monsters, and sky daddies.|`|ZNo1Ah5taa	Yes.Yes they do, so pick up a six pack of them today!|`|7mhRDbvsaa	nwo|`|AA11124121	if the castor and castee believe they do...|`|gtVGRvfhaa	if the 'victim' believes, yes.

Dgwy3YHsaa	Honey, it requires LOVE.  This is an attribute Atheists are deficient in because LOVE requires selflessness.  The acute Atheist is "self-centered" and "egocentric".  Hence, the Atheist cannot LOVE in terms of True Love, but rather engages is self-seeking love.|`|cFrtOg45aa	Grow up, atheism is not the "in" thing anymore.

Maybe some counseling?|`|eO2rnf7yaa	It is often through our emotions that we are most vulnerable to Satan's temptation.  Since you deny the existence of God, Satan knows that you are easy prey.    Subconsciously, maybe you know that you are at risk of increased temptation from Satan,  and your subconscious mind is leading you to be emotionally closed to help protect you from Satan.  Admit God exists,  and perhaps you will not feel so threatened to be emotionally more open.  If you accept Jesus Christ into your life, Satan will be put on notice that you are less vulnerable to his temptations to sin.|`|qvW5ZYruaa	That has nothing to do with your religious or non-religious beliefs, but with you as a person.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	your evolving into an emo|`|3oCdTWYZaa	I agree with the first answer!|`|AA11785285	Being atheist, and being socially constipated are not related.

Those that have a natural love and affection in themselves can show emotion and love towards their neighbor.    GALATIANS 5: 14 - 26:    For the entire Law stands fulfilled in one saying, namely: You must love your neighbor as yourself. If, though, YOU keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that YOU do not get annihilated by one another. But I say, Keep walking by spirit and YOU will carry out no fleshly desire at all. For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that YOU would like to do YOU do not do.     Furthermore, if YOU are being led by spirit, YOU are not under law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, divisions, sects, envies, drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these.     As to these things I am forewarning YOU, the same way as I did forewarn YOU, that those who practice such things will not inherit Gods kingdom. On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus impaled the flesh together with its passions and desires. If we are living by spirit, let us go on walking orderly also by spirit.     Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.  -----------------------|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	emotion is what make us human, it's our greatest strength but it's also our greatest flaw.

3eGS6p9Jaa	The answer to your question is two fold the hard thing that you are fighting is the power of the symbol of the confederate flag.  You can use the stars and bars as a symbol of southern pride but the hard thing is that part of that southern pride is the perceived support of slavery and racist attitude toward other races.  The groups that have embraced the southern flag mainly white supremacists and other extremest groups.  The answer is yes it can mean southern pride in a positive way to you, but it has a negative aspect to many.|`|uBJokWtuaa	Hrmm.....  All decent answers so far. But think on this-  If I flew a WW2 German flag, would it mean I embraced the philosphies of WW2 Germany? Or would it mean I was just proud that grandpa fought in the German army?   Whatever I meant by it, I certainly wouldn't be able to go around saying 'You'll just have to accept my German pride' and not expect a lot of people to be offended and fearful.   Symbols mean what you want them to mean. But some have already been imbued with serious baggage.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	You know they can say all those things about southern pride, but they know that for many people that flag will always be associated with slavery.    And you know that many people in the south still have the same attitudes of racism.  I think it would be a nice gesture on their part to alter the flag in some way, or to drop it all together.  Because of their history, they should make an effort heal the harm that has been done, and a different flag would be a start.  But I guess America in general should make a gesture also, like a national apology.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	1. The Confederate battle flag is not racist. This is a myth generated by Yankee propagandists  2. The flag shows the pride we have in our ancestry and traditions. It is also the designated flag of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who also have black members. I have seen blacks native to the South fly this flag and put it on the back window of their pickups like the Southern white boys do.   3. It is part of our culture, like singing Dixie.

All his teachings has been commited to memory for a few generations since the Buddha  (which explains why our current scriptures are extrememly repetitive and excruciating frustrating to read). It is some few hundred years that these teachings are inscribed onto leaves using needles. Then the next phase is copying them using ink and paper by hand before printing finally took over. This first part explains how we get our current scriptures.    Now, the Buddha travelled along the Ganges to preach his Dhamma for 45 years meeting different people of different castes ranging from monarchs to slaves. How he teach is dependent on who the audience is. His personal attendant Ananda who is blessed with a super memory, recited all these teachings after the Buddha passed away. For the sake of categorisation, each "instance" is recorded as a "sutra" or "sutta", and is normally named after the person to whom the Buddha preached. For example, the "Kalama Sutta" is named because it was preached to the people of Kalama (this sutta is famous for encouring free inquiry and discrding blind faith).    Over the years, all these teachings has been compiled into 3 huge sections, collectively known as the Tipitaka which means (3 baskets). So the Tipitaka would be the rough equivalent of the Chirstians' Bible, the Muslims' Koran and the Jews' Torah.    The classication of the Tipitaka is as follows:    1. Sutta Pitaka, which contains the Buddhas' sermons. There are further divided into 5 categories:  Digha Nikaya (the collection of long discourses), Majjhima Nikaya (collection of middle-length discourses), Samyutta Nikaya (collection of miscellaneous discourses), Anguttara Nikaya (collection of "further-factor" discourses, up to the factor of 11) and Khuddaha Nikaya (collection of small texts). The first 3 are available in popular book stores in hardcover by Widsom Publishing. The famous book "Dhammapada" is a sub-set of Khuddaka Nikaya, the last of the division.    2. Vinaya Pitaka - This is the collection of texts which concerns the rules of conduct of the monastic community. They also include the stories and incidents behind each rule thus explaining not just what a monk cannot do but also WHY it should not be done.    3. Abhidharma Pitaka - Not directly taught by the Buddha, this section is basically the doctrinal principles taught in the Sutta Pitaka but just reorganized in a more digestable infrastructure (unlike the Sutta Pitaka which is all over the place). This is also the section that deals with the nature of mind and matter, which provides the basis of why many modern psychologists and physicists are fan of the Buddha ;)

I find him attractive, even though I'm not sexually attracted to biological men.     As far as females, I think Sara Gilbert (played Darlene on Roseanne) as well as Renee Zellwegger are both VERY attractive to me, everyone else tells me they both look weird and/or ugly.  *shrugs*|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Definitely.

AA10819407	I think it was a bit rude on their part, they should have made some sort    of conversation to try and include you...( women can be a bit catty)  You may have to go out of your comfort zone sometimes to get others attention. Don't be a wall flower,let people know who you are.Bring up a topic that is in the news, and ask them what their opinion is on the topic. You may also end up with some good female friends....Good Luck!!|`|dPsaYMOvaa	The women where probably engrossed in their own conversation. If you wanted to chat, why didn't you inititate a conversation? They are probably thinking the same thing about you.|`|rThIVk2maa	Well neither of you tried to initiate conversation, so I'd say both sides were... not rude but perhaps a bit antisocial.|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Yeah, I tend to agree with you. As you are the "new girl" and by yourself it would have been nice if they'd made an effort. I always try to make this effort with a newcomer because I know that not everyone is nice enough to care about another's feelings in a new situation.      - Pepper.|`|kKpYQ42oaa	I think what you are trying to say is that you were a little bit offended that these women did nothing to make you feel more at ease, and that you wish they would have been more hospitable.  I would not take it personally. The reasons that you feel they failed to make you feel comfortable are innumerable.
p1e15P7Laa	She should take one becuase that just seems better
G4vFjh0yaa	Now temper this response with the fact that I do not mean to insult you or to be rude.  Stop referring to or thinking that any man who loved you is  a two year old. That is not a good start to problem solving. If'n you want to get mad at me then do so............that said  Put him in a comfortable place and tell him you have something to say and do so. Then let him walk away without an answer at the time if he chooses to do so. Or be prepared to hear what he might say.  You fostered this situation with your "I was never allowed". Now seriously you had the power to change that then and didn't.  Now follow through and maybe it isn't even as bad as you think.  I certainly hope not. Anyone on here for any  period of time knows that you don't put up with much.  In my humble opinion.  If that doesn't work then open a can of whoop on him and get it over.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	If you were legally married this stuff about the mortgage should have been answered during the divorce.If the divorce is still pending then talk to a lawyer.

I don't know if you are in a 'common law' state or not, but you may have some legal rights. Most lawyers give free consultations of about 20 minutes or so. I am willing to bet he has more assets than you know about. That is why he kept 'his' money separate from yours.|`|LisP31O8aa	I'm sorry to say but you have already answered your own question really.  Nothing has worked and you have done most everything possible to get this guy to come around and do what you'd like but - - - - - - he just doesn't, he hasn't and most likely, never will.      Go on to the next level and do what you must without him.  Since he refuses to have anything to do with the conversation you want, let him have it with an attorney or whoever , otherwise just do what you want to do and can do.      Stop obsessing about what's not going to work and stop beating the horse that's already dead, so it seems.  If he hasn't by now, he's not going to.  Put your energies into something else.      You don't say what you need to discuss or why so I don't know if you need an attorney or just good advice or if you are still sharing some legal stuff with this man.      This is a pothole you have fallen into and it's leading you nowhere.  Get out of it.  Good luck too.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Do you live in a community property state? If so then you have a huge advantage in forcing knowledge of  his assets, even those hidden. The court will compel him to disclose. Since you are no longer with him then you have nothing to lose.    I wonder how you hooked up with him in the first place, you must not have been paying attention.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	You were not legally married.  Guess what, no community property etc etc.  He can do as he pleases.  It was your mistake allowing the problem to begin.  Your only option is to hire a lawyer.  Good luck.|`|6ozmjp3xaa	You have a lot of unanswered question here, Like were you legal married and for how long ? If you were married to him for over 10 years I wouldn't bother to even try to talk to him I would seek a lawyer, He might be dragging his feet while he is doing         a way with        all your combined assets*** EDIT** I think then he still wants to hold on to YOU
AA11703455	I think this is trick question.    I would say "Die" since that is the last thing I am going to do that day.    Ok, since with my family history, no males pass the age of 65, and I am 55, the day that I die may be sooner than I want, most likely I will have no notice that it is my last day.     But, if the heart didn't die all at once, I wouldn't waste my time doing something I hadn't done before, or try to change something in the past.

b8yhcxmRaa	Your situation poses a difficult dilemma.  On one hand, loyalty is a dying trait, especially when combined with the trust and experience that have been built over 20 years of working the same job.  However, some businesses require new blood and fresh ideas for advancement, and sometimes survival.  If firing the loyal employee for the skilled one means the survival or your business and the bottom line of the business, then it would be a tough decision that needs to be made. In other words, if replacing the loyal for the skilled means more profit that secures others jobs as a result, then yes.  However, if the benefits are marginal, then i would not trade loyalty and trust.  Maybe you could "invest" into the loyal worker and have them work on their skills that is required for your business, and therefore you'll have both traits at the end of the day.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Too many questions left unanswered to know if I would or not.  If it happened, I bet there was a very good reason for it, however.  It simply doesn't make sense to fire someone that you've known well and who is doing a good job.  Perhaps the job outgrew the person, and the person wouldn't or couldn't keep up with the technology.  The business owner, in such a case would have no choice.    There is more to loyalty of an employee than just showing up everyday on time for work.|`|rThIVk2maa	Depends, why am I firing the older employee? If they aren't performing as needed, I'd offer them their retirement and let them go. If I've put up with them for 20 years, I can put up with them another few months till they get their retirement package.|`|sGWVQcQmaa	no - loyalty means a lot to employers!|`|oJsrGmmPaa	Depending on what the employee has done to deserve to get fired. Or you can nudge this employee towards retirement....oh, wait, the economy sucks.|`|Ltv37Azzaa	You could try to reassign the older worker|`|hyA664XIaa	No. I'm not an employer but I suggest keeping faithful and maybe on occasion hire skilled labour or better still educate to higher standard.  My view is yes extremely skilled is valuable to you and other employers. how long can you keep if high skills are on demand?     increase business potential, then you can hire both.
1TYZDRUqaa	There are plenty of online churches that will ordain you.  A few of them really are god respecting.

You do not have to be ordained and only need a minimal of training so you understand the Gospel and are a Born Again believer.   Actually all Christians are called to preach the Gospel, but not necessarily from a pulpit.   Preaching the Gospel is usually to people that are not saved and mostly outside of a church setting.    If you want to be a Pastor that is another thing..  This is a calling, and God really calls you to be a Pastor.   You need training and need to be able to TEACH the people in the church the Bible.  You also have to be able to administer people under you and run a church and it's many functions.    You do not have to have a DD, but should be a Bible school graduate, and have a good understanding of the Bible.|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	For the denominations you need to go to their collages to learn al of their lies.

As for protestant churches, the denominations really just pick and choose, however they require a class in theology.

Those ordained by men are not ministers of Creator nor speak His words. But the words of men. For only the Spirit can speak through men to teach and those are chosen by Creator. For we are instructed by the bible to make no notes prior to speaking. Because the Spirit is who teaches through us.    Romans 13:1   Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.   For there is no power but of YHWH:  the powers that be are ordained of YHWH.    Hebrews 8:2  A minister of the sanctuary,   and of the true tabernacle,   which YHWH pitched,   and not man.    You can go out and minister to others, as in spread the word. You can go assist others, etc. But to hold the title of minister, pastor, preacher and it not given by Creator. Is blasphemy.    I myself am an ordained minister of YHWH by YHWH. I am a keeper of the law per Romans. My job is not to speak unto a congregation nor to visit those in hospitals. Those are ministers of Yahushua, the care takers. Where I am the old man in the basement hand writing the bible to ensure its proper.    Trust me from being ordained, do not take a title of His unless He gives it. You do not want His wrath nor the weight upon your tree unless you understand completely. For being a minister or such, any you teach wrong, that wrong is removed from their tree and added to yours. So the titles come with great weight attached and are not to be taken lightly.    Jeremiah 23:2   Therefore thus saith YHWH Elohim of Israel   against the pastors that feed my people;   Ye have scattered my flock,   and driven them away,   and have not visited them:   behold,   I will visit upon you the evil of your doings,   saith YHWH.    Jeremiah 23:1   Woe be unto the pastors  that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!   saith YHWH.    Matthew 18:6   But whoso shall offend one of these little ones  which believe in me,  it were better for him   that a millstone were hanged about his neck,   and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.    But we are told to go out and minister, which means speak of the word to others, the non believers.|`|d7FP0VmDaa	Setting aside the idea of a preacher named outlaw and why would you want too.

midmBgJJaa	I would imagine. Many lines in the Koran condemn, denigrate, and threaten non-Muslims. But I could find similar passages condemning non-believers in the Old Testament - so I think that Islam can be reformed by liberals to be more consistent with the modern world - including freedom of speech, religion, and gender equality. It's largely a backward and coercive faith at this moment in history - "Islamic law" is nothing but a shrill justification for Iran to execute ex-Muslims, for old men to marry young girls, and for mullahs to stone adulterers and ban books.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	There is NO Western religion that has NOT been violent at some time in its history.

As Yeshuah allegedly said: "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|A5HPUGxraa	first of all muslim teach or speak just to tell the truth with the hope someone will see it that's all and the theory of "to convert or eliminate non-muslims" i guess you need to rethink it again ( the only way is to read or know more about islam)    islam the word itself has something to do with peace both inner peace when you believe in god and peace with the entire world (it means no more violence no more fight no more hatred..)    those words would be enough to give an idea about how peaceful this religion is i guess but there is more    muslims has no option to force anyone to convert or to change their religion check the sentence in Albaqara no. 256 (this is the second surah of Qur'aan the muslims' religious book)  this is very important to clear the misunderstanding that simply came from either muslims who do not completely understand islam or other non-muslims for being unaware with islamic rules and beliefs     islam told us to let people free and the only measurement in this life is "manners" yes manners not the one who worships god most in mosques or so    a muslim in islam (this is hadith= said by the prophet) is the one who doesn't harm anyone else even by his mouth (this needs more thinking so the name of the religion is about peace and a muslim is the peaceful person who does not harm anyone i guess this is more than enough to give you an idea about the true islam)    i know unfortunately and sadly there are misconceptions, misunderstanding, and nonsense about islam as i mentioned above either by muslims who do not completely understand islam or by other non-muslims for being unaware with islamic rules and beliefs     is this enough to realize that the core (both islam and muslims) has nothing to do with violence? it is the perfect core for a peaceful religion! as if god is telling humanity it is time to stop the fight it is all about manners be good humans that's all     now you the one who can decide however you will need to read more about it so there are some links:    Liberal view of other religions by Islam  http://www.muslim.org/islam/tolerance.ht...

ANYONE WHO SAYS ISLAM IS A PEACEFUL RELIGION MUST HAVE CARTOON NETWORK ALL ALONE AS A TV CHANNEL...LOL!|`|zAkeKg5Qaa	I think at its heart, Islam is a peaceful religion focused on the glory of Allah. For 100s of years, Islam represented the epitome of science, medicine, philosophy, architecture and theology. I think that some societal extremes filtered their ways into Islam and usurped its true message of peace, love and faith. I don't think it is rampant. I think the majority of Muslims are wonderful people. Unfortunately, there are small cross-section of ignorant, illiterate, disenfranchised, hateful, extremists that have done terrible things in the name of Islam.     It is a little like Hitler taking the Swastika and redefining it in a negative way that endures.|`|C9nOqOZKaa	From what i understand about Islam is that their main goal is to erradicate all non-muslim religions from the earth.  The Koran is composed of the old and new testament and the dreams of their prophet or messenger MOhamed.  They believe JC was a prophet but not the Son of God, and that He did not die in the cross but was hidden to avoid his death.    There is a fundamentalist Islam, and there are two main groups of muslims, the Shiite and Sunni.    Islam is a way is violent for it discriminates women in the eyes of christian denominations, among other issues.    Yes, all non-muslim religions are said to be infidels in the eyes of Islam.  They say that Islam was and is the first religion that Abraham and his decendents preached.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	The Islam-haters will say yes. Intelligent and fair people who have actually studied always say no. In fact, I am yet to come across a critic of Islam who doesn't hate Islam.  Anyway, here are some peaceful verses which may answer your question:    Bismillah errahman e eraheem:    On war:    "And fight for the cause of God against those who fight against you: but commit not the injustice of attacking them first: God loveth not such inustice." 2:186    On captives of war:    "And afterwards, let there be free dismissals or ransomings, till the war hath laid down its burdens. Thus do. 47:4    On Christians and Jews and those who believe:    "Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians -- whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor shall they grieve" (2:62, 5:69, and many other verses).    On unbelievers:    "And if they lean to peace, lean thou also to it; and put thy trust in God: for He is the Hearing, the Knowing". 8:63    "...but take onoe of them as friends or helpers, except those who shall seek an asylum among your allies, and those who come over to you-their hearts forbidding them to make war on you, or to make war on their own people....But, if they depart from you, and make not war against you and oofer you peace, then God alloweth you no occassion against them." 4:91    "He who slayeth any one, unless it be a person guilty of manslaughter, or of spreading disordre in the land, shall be as though he had slain all mankind; but that he who saceth a life, shall be as though he had saved all mankind alive." 5:35    You simply can't miss the peaceful and tolerant verses in the Quran-unless you choose not to see which a lot of people do and this says something about those people. What kind of people ignore the good verses and rip the so-called jihad verses right out their contexts? Fanatics and extremists do that. In short, these verses are an inconvienience for the haters-including the Muslim fundies.    Moreover, Muhammad (pbuh) has a repuation for being so kind and fair to his enemies. He enjoined his followers to feed captives of war (even if they themselves had to live off a few dates) and they were not to be harmed. Also, when Muhammad (pbuh) conquered Mecca-the Meccans who drove him from his home and tortured him-all he said was, "Depart, for today you are all free!". If he was as murderous as they say he is, he would have absolutely slaughtered the Meccans for what they did to him wouldn't he?|`|kFpFU97zaa	Says the same thing in the Bible and Torah.|`|Iva8drdfaa	No.    Islam may appear violent on the Crust, but that is because that is all you can easily see.        At the Core, Islam is one of the more peaceful religions.|`|Dimi8By2aa	The first answer is right, it isn't much different than the Bible and the Torah.

I think the Christians were termed "mislead" and Jews were outright wrong. So I think the whole religion breeds intolerance from what little I read.|`|FvoxgjbJaa	Yes, Islam, Mohammedanism, or whatever name it goes by is a violent false religion. Their god is the devil.    The Koran says terrible things about Christians which I wll not repeat.    Mohammad himself, after he had been run out of one town, for trying to pass himself off as a prophet, later returned, when he had a sizable following of those he had duped, and wiped out the inhabitants of that town. This is the example Mohammad gave to his  followers then and now.    Here is another example: there were some Catholic priests living in a Muslim country (Turkey) where they had in their employment as a manservant a muslim. He had worked for them for many long years but one day revealed to them that when the time comes for Jihad (holy war) he would kill them quickly by slitting their throats.    What separates Christians who follow the true Faith (One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic) and the Muslims, besides the fact it is a false religion,  is the absence of mercy towards others.    Our God is a God of love; a merciful God Who puts up with a lot of ingratitude on the part of a very sinful mankind. Unless you find Him in the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church that He founded for the dispensation of mercy towards sinful men, you will never have peace, joy or happiness in this life.    Jesus Christ, the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob, gave His Apostles and disciples instruction to go and teach all nations, baptizing them for the remission of (original) sin. Before He ascended into Heaven He said to His Apostles and disciples: "in peace I leave you, my peace I give unto you."     The false prophet of the false god of Mohammad preaches violence against those who disagree or refuse to accept their false message. The true God teaches us to simply leave the unbelievers, go to another town and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against the unbelievers. Or as our Lord said: "leave them alone, they are blind..."|`|WjRqYf6naa	The Muslims I know personally seem to just want to be left alone to live their lives and raise their families in peace.

But we all make mistakes, and everybody deserves a second chance for we know God forgives all our sins; Jesus died for our sins on the cross so that we won't have to face any suffering. As far as the terrorist and religion aspect is concerned, they just use it as a weapon as the trend follows.

IJZZkDUvaa	The myth of the constellation Sagittarius is this:    There was a good centaur named Chiron. He was very old and wise.  Chiron is who taught humans how to use herbs, plants, and flowers for medicine and cooking.  He taught humans all about the stars and planets, and he taught the ancient Greeks about astrology and how to tell the seasons from the stars.    Chiron, because he was half man and half horse, was very strong.  He could perform tasks that ordinary men, even those like Herakles, were too weak to do.  He would often help men in their tasks, especially when they had to face horrible monsters.  One time Chiron was helping Herakles to defeat an especially horrible monster - the Hydra - with many heads and a poisonous bite.  The monster bit Chiron in the leg. Because Chiron was immortal, he could not die of the wound, but because the monster's bite was especially poisonous, it would never heal. It hurt worse than any wound since has hurt.    Chiron gave up his immortality so that another man, Prometheus, who was suffering in Hades for giving fire to humans (after Zeus told him NOT TO DO THAT!) could trade places with him. This way both Prometheus' and Chiron's sufferings could end.     Because he was so generous as to sacrifice his life for another, Zeus placed him in the stars as the constellation Sagittarius, where we can still see him today.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	Cheiron  Cheiron, or Chiron, was the King of the Centaurs, and unlike the rest of his race was known for his wisdom, kindness, and his extensive knowledge of healing. He was the son of Cronos and Philyra. Originally, he was the Thessalian God of Healing, but that changed when the Hellenic Gods took over. He was incorporated as the wise centaur. In Greek Mythology, he was the tutor of Asclepius, Theseus, and Achilles (among others). When he left earth, died, or whatever, he was placed in the sky as the constellation Sagittarius. The name means "hand".|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	Damn, I just read this somewhere. It said centaurs were party animals, drinking and getting carried away, and they do so at a god's wedding, so someone came and shot the wisest of the centaurs with an arrow. I forget what his name was, but apparently he became sagittarius then.    Wow. That was almost no help at all.
AA10464706	Most schools are populated based on where you live.  Hence, people living in city X send their kids to school X.  The only way would be to force people to bus their kids to different schools.  Let's take MA as an example.  There are two cities right next to each other, Lawrence and Andover.  Lawrence is a poor town with mostly colored folk and poor white folk.  Andover is super wealthy (a respectable house is $1 million) and mostly white.  However, they are side by side on a map.  You can easily walk or take a bus from one to the other city.  You have to randomly pick some kids from Lawrence go to an Andover school. You could never force the kids from Andover to go to a Lawrence school.  The parents would just send them to  a private school.  In this case, you aren't blending by race but by wealth.  Let's face there is no black and white.  Just rich and poor.  I'm a well off colored person and people treat me just fine when they know I have money.|`|rd4G85ksaa	I'd put them in a massive blender|`|wKjxESbBaa	hahaha seletive breeding only the strong survive nah really the blenders' a good idea|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Unfortunately its more about status.

Significantly, Paul does not cite any scriptural precedent for his advice, presumably because there isn't any.  That being the case, Paul's advice was simply that, a recommendation, likely based on the Jewish cultural practices in the same way that Pharisees built 'hedges' around the commandments delivered by specific Divine instructions.

As a martial arts practitioner one will have to adopt certain rules, e.g. rule of dress, bowing towards the opponent, etc. This is no different to having to adopt the rules of soccer if one wants to play soccer.     When evaluating something one should look below the surface and not judge and dismiss something based on mere appearances.|`|AA11923447	I know a number of Christian martial artists. Some of them do practice Zen and other forms of Buddhism. Since Buddhism is non-theistic, there is no conflict with Christianity (I know several Christian clergy members who are also Buddhists). The reason that I am not a martial artist myself is because, as part of my Christian beliefs, I am a pacifist. It has nothing to do with a fear of Eastern influences, but with my personal ethics. I do not wish to engage in combat with other people; hence, practicing martial arts would be a bit pointless for me (unless I did it purely as a sport, which I do not personally find interesting).|`|UK0HFbCyaa	Forms of fighting is just techniques to protect and to conqueor...I don't see why something that came out of a religion has to represent that religion. If there's was a Martial Arts called Nae, and Nae was created by Buddhists, and Nae's goals were to calm the mind and increase physical reflexes, couldn't a Christain want those goals while not being Buddhist and still being Chrsitain?|`|q9C46Wuqaa	Yes, Martial Arts is from Buddhism... Christian Martial Arts? What's the difference other than the name.
XxWovDNCaa	Hell, like heaven, Oz and Narnia, Is imaginary.  As is your god.  Hell is nothing more than a threat, designed to keep the gullible idiots in the pews and filling the collection plate. Nothing more.|`|iX0CoNkXaa	We have to many mamby pamby preachers afraid of scaring people.    Preach it hot!

Your fundie neighbour is a tool.|`|Dgwy3YHsaa	Because it's called the "falling away of the church", which now teaches on pleasant happy-go-lucky things, sunshine and lollipops, like prosperity and good sex, though Jesus taught most and exclusively on perils of hell if people don't repent.|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	It is sort of like watching horror movies. You see enough of them it takes more for you to be scared. It might be true, but since life is still going for most people they ignore it. You can cry wolf only so many times before it becomes meaningless. The lukewarm Christians have not bothered to check things out so for them life goes on. Since they have moved on the pastor now has to change his or message to get people into church. If people would check things out they would know that certain events have to happen in the world that haven't happened yet before Jesus comes back. But since they don't care, the passage about Jesus coming back will come true like a thief in the night. Someone needs to get their attention again before it is too late.|`|k5X78IM3aa	"And what does the Lord God require of you but to do justly, love mercy & to walk humbly with your God"...    I see no reason to learn about hell if you live as Micah says.|`|E9chZY74aa	Jesus spoke more about Hell than about Heaven.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Yes if all else fails use threats.|`|pYrooh0Haa	Hahaha. fool. your god is a false god.

Silly me!|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Because people realised a long time ago that fear of eternal torture was a stupid reason to be a good person.|`|AA12070800	Jesus himself didn't say he came to save people from hell.  Why does salvation need to be all about being saved from hell?  Perhaps salvation and redemption are about experiencing healing, love and grace, and about "having life and having it more abundantly."  Faith is about learning to love God and love neighbor, not just about what we need to do to avoid hell.

Not that you should let her mess up your life or anything but if you could just see that she has a problem and love her anyway it would be to your benifit. My brother is schizoid and has caused a lot of problems over the years for me and the rest of my family. I love him anyway and always will. I won't allow him in my house without me being there, but I love him. I try to always remember what a great little kid he was and how he loved everyone and everyone loved him.

No one serious uses the term Warlock.    We don't believe in Satan. And we don't possess *powers.* That's the silly kind of stuff you hear on evangical websites and teeny-bopper Charmed and Harry Potter boards. Oh, and those posers and wanna bees who love horror movies too much and want to feel special.      Magic is part of nature, like making an herbal tea to heal your throat or meditating on an orange candle to clear our minds for a test, or meditating to improve our intuitive abilities.    It's reallly sad how so many Christians indiscriminately spread lies about what we believe, what we do, etc., believing other Christians who unfortunately have it wrong. It's sad; you're going against your own religion bearing false witness against others because you're willing to listen to anyone who calls himself a Christian and has a sinsiter story to tell.     Go to www.witchvox.com and read our articles and essays. At least learn what we really believe and do before you start telling people what we are or criticizing our beliefs.|`|UxooffHZaa	Why would you want to make others realize something you yourself are not certain of?

I believe you are speaking of demonic possession, and that is real. Some people have been known to do all sorts of things when they have been possessed.

In the Qur'an there is also mention of such things and their existence and how their powers are given to them through the Satan or Devil. It is not as common in areas where there is a lot of population.  But you will always hear stories about it from rural areas around the world. My grandparents have told me many stories of things they've encountered of such nature...as well as my mom. Even I've witnessed some encounters and unless someone has witnessed it for themselves, they most likely will never believe you.|`|HB5VY91faa	MSB  ...I could not have said it better myself.  Step out of the box of bigots, ignorance, etc.and educate, open your mind.  If you truly understood anything about witches, you would know that their belief does not include Satan. The true magic that witches see, feel, even tap is a natural flow of energies.  It is the sound of a child laughing.  It is the beauty of a bud becoming a flower.  If is the taste of ripened fruit....etc.      People exist...with differing beliefs, perspectives.  Instead of being so judgmental regarding these differences, embrace them.      I hope you find what you are seeking.  blessings|`|xzJxxCd9aa	look love stop looking at medieval  dictionary deffinitions then declaring them as hard facts.

But any way I was driving to school one day & I got ran off the road by a person, I went down a hill, & on my way down I went or my 2 right wheels & somehow it turned me around so I was going backwords. & I am not sl;amming on the gas to try & slow me down but it didn't work, So I am now at the bottom of the bill on a field that had anout 1-2  inches of water in it. I tried for hours to get the car back up the hill in the mud (Turned it into mud with the wheels) & then I get it back up & I was so relieved that I went out sode of the car to look around it, & I slipped down the tracks that I made trying to get back up & in to the Mud.

If the Abrahamic God exists, certain logical entailments necessarily follow.  One of these is that He speaks Truth.  I'll be honest and confess that proving that one ought to speak and believe truth is a lot harder than it seems.  I've done so to my own satisfaction, but I won't bother you with all that.  He certainly has given (taking you premise that He has spoken) adequate reasoning for His actions.  But you have to know Him in order to understand what He is doing.  As to your last question, He certainly showed up and helped me in a critical situation.  I see Him doing it all the time.  But again, He has chosen to operate through human agency.  We are image bearers, after all.  So most of the time His work is done behind the scenes.  But not always.  The faith that religious folks go on about is really simply a willingness to trust that He knows what He's doing even when we can't see it.  Believing in God is easy.  Trusting Him is hard.    peace|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	That is what faith is, taking God at His word. You have a negative/wrong  view of God, you think He should act like a human. He is their with everyone at any given time. But you what to know why He dose not interfere in our situations. Because He cannot, what kind of God would He be if He helped someone and not every one? Why dose He not stop our loved ones from dieing, from getting sick with cancer. These things Satan put into motion, not God. He is trying to give man time to come back to Him. He is longsuffering, not willing that any should parrish, but all sbould come to repentance.    2Pe 3:9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.     The word that Jesus has spoken will be the standered that will judge us at the judgement, Joh 12:48  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.     Believe His word (the New Testament) or be lost.
G6Uy43coaa	Wow...I understand completely.  Through your poem, I feel confident in a decision I made about an hour ago.    Thanks for helping me understand another point of view.  I just hope he receives what I will say with an open mind and welcoming heart.    It was beautiful.    Thanks|`|MzWiGnqdaa	Well, convincing her that you are not a screwball is already out of the question.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	It sounds like you want her pity. You come across as needy and weak- if a woman wrote this to you, how would you react? I'm not negating your feeling, nor the emotions of your words, but think about the impression you want to make. Does this portray you as a strong, confident man, ready for the challenges of a true relationship?    I'm not hacking on you man- I'm trying to help. But in a relationship, there has to be a bit of tension, a feeling that you're a challenge. Isn't that part of what you like about her? This is the kind of poem you give after you've been together for a while. Show her some backbone if you want to stand a chance.  Besides, I don't know her, but what if she LIKES phony, fake screwballs? Or is incapable of responding to real and genuine people at this stage in her life? You might be wasting your time here no matter what you do. But I'm a hopeless romantic- give it your best shot.|`|zRPXczxAaa	If I were the person addressed in this poem, and I knew you as slightly as it seems to imply, I would not be pleased by what seems to be a needy and presumptuous plea for intimacy.  I would ignore it.|`|Et011ogJaa	I would think and hope that everyone wants honesty and deep intimacy.Some are not ready to suffer the pain of it....so the charade does go on. I can relate to the plea for honesty...    Reach out to me!  Act from a place of honesty,  Risk your happiness, your purpose.  Bar the returns of unhappy strife.  Put away the tools of damnation.  Limn my voice, which makes you so sure.  Say what you feel; say what you fear.  But dont think our hearts wont break  Because there is nothing that is as real as that    Edit: Thanks
vvHI8roYaa	I find it so funny that some people use online websites for translations and have random tattoos and logos that say the weirdest things in Japanese... I saw a guy that had a symbol "arm" on his neck the other day and had to force myself not to laugh. haha      The translation for "Greed for speed" is    ( what Babelfish says)  (don-yoku) means not stopping for anything, greedy... so I think it's perfect for this case  but  means the speed of something, like the speed of light...  it doesn't mean Fastness.   (speed)(building speed; acceleration)  seems more fit for a motorcycle.  How about    or   or      hoped it helped :]|`|AA11928403	How about:   >> supeedo iyoku = speed drive(strong desire)     >>supeedo yoku = speed greed    supeedo( is speed in Japanese it's imported word.|`|1XWpiGs3aa	It can be:    Greed for Speed        zensokuryoku no tame donyoku     full speed   a particle in Japanese   = for   = greedor  read as 'gouyoku'if you want to emphasize the greediness more)    Hope it helps

TLLklriUaa	Every person whose e-mail with this claim I responded to eventually ended up bringing up the fact that Obama was black.    There's the reason.    When you ask these people who claim he "fits the bill" for the Bible verses to back up their claim, they stammer around before falling silent.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	The Antichrist is naturally against what Jesus taught, preached and gave his entire life for.  Jesus is and always will be the the role that we should live.  Some think Obama does not live up the standard. IDK since I have enough trouble keeping up with my own misgivings.    It would be quite impossible to find perfection among men and some will always find something to complain about. Locating the imperfections and expounding upon them may make a person seem to be more Antichrist than perhaps they really are.  Only close and personal friends may know the truth and sometimes even they may be fooled.|`|PDUoC5Zsaa	Because of the cult like following, not just stateside but world wide.

If everyone expects Obama to be the Antichrist, its definitely not gonna be him.    3.The end times haven't begun yet.

xWSIIOpaaa	Because nobody wears more than one hat at a time. Otherwise, since the verb "portare" could either mean "to wear" or "to carry", the sentence with the plural would sound like: "We carry the hats".|`|o2ANkJi2aa	well..because a person can wear only a hat...it wouldn't make sense in italian the sentence "noi portiamo i cappelli"... :)
DQxmUL8daa	Each of the sentences are grammatically correct in itself, but do not make sense when combined to express a thought.      "Every other" means the event occurs within one specified time period - season - then does not occur in the following one, and occurs again in the one following that; this pattern continues until a specified end.     Example:  "1" Occurs once every other character.    1, g, 1, t, 1, 7, v, 1, O, 1, Q, 1...  The "1" appears, a character occurs that is not "1", then "1" occours again, and so on.      In yor premise, the flower would only bloom once per year - four seasons.  In the sample sentence, it would mean that the flower would bloom only once in two out of the four seasons in the year.  So, yes, your sentence does mean twice per year.    To illustrate it using an example similar to the last:   NB (one year)    (Bloom, None, Bloom, None), (Bloom, None, Bloom, None)...           =2 Blooms/year                    =2 blooms/year|`|cRz31MlMaa	No every other year means like every 2nd year or so.

The life bestowed upon plants and animals by the Life Carriers does not return to the Life Carriers upon the death of plant or animal. The departing life of such a living thing possesses neither identity nor personality; it does not individually survive death. During its existence and the time of its sojourn in the body of matter, it has undergone a change; it has undergone energy evolution and survives only as a part of the cosmic forces of the universe; it does not survive as individual life. The survival of mortal creatures is wholly predicated on the evolvement of an immortal soul within the mortal mind.

Trust in Jehovah and do good; Reside in the earth, and deal with faithfulness.  Also take exquisite delight in Jehovah, And he will give you the requests of your heart.  Roll upon Jehovah your way, And rely upon him, and he himself will act.  And he will certainly bring forth your righteousness as the light itself, And your justice as the midday.  Keep silent before Jehovah And wait longingly for him.     Do not show yourself heated up at anyone making his way successful, At the man carrying out [his] ideas.  Let anger alone and leave rage; Do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.  For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.

Mind and soul are eternal and always close to whom loves them. She knows it inside, she can still feel her sis close but she cant see. And she miss her... But they heart are still linked, one there above, other here in our dimension... nothing its against Lords laws. and everything has a why and a reason to be..  one day she will discover it and see it very clear...   ( sorry my grammar, actually im from other country)|`|nwnILcEAaa	That must be sadder than any of us who are not twins can imagine. It is nice that she has another sister and that you care about how she is feeling on her birthday. That must be consoling to her, too. Maybe it is time for the two of you to do something new and different together. Try an adventure of going somewhere or doing something together that neither of you has ever done before. Even if it is just a bus trip or a restaurant. It will be a distraction to keep her from dwelling too much on her lost twin. Time to enjoy what life has to offer.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I don't know what my mother felt when her twin sister died. They lived  apart due to marriage all their adult lives. Only an occasional visit  after a very long trip was my mom and her sister able to see each  other and that was a stretch of five years or so. My uncle by marriage  was the reason. He was an alcoholic and didn't want to be around  my mother and family. He passed on to his daughter things that has  kept her away from her moms' family since her mother died. Now all  the elders have passed on, and no one knows where my cousin lives.  Nor she for knowing where her cousins are.        My mom didn't grieve that I ever saw. She was a strong woman  who rarely let her emotions show. Even when her parents passed  away. She left her emotions at the cemetary, and went on with life.    She continued to have birthdays without her, just as she'd always  done as an adult. And she never showed any remorse on that   special day. I actually don't think she missed her sister. Whom  she felt was prettier, more talented, and a better person all in all.  She always had remained in her shadow as kids. So maybe she  felt that she was no longer in competition. I'll never know.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	There is nothing you can say that will heal this pain. Just being there for her is all you can do. I have a twin brother and losing him would affect me terribly. There is a special bond with twins. Not sharing my birthday would feel so weird. So just be there for her. You sound like a very caring and sensitive sister. She is lucky to have you.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Are there any lovely pictures that you have of your sister that passed or the 2 of them together? or all of you together that you can copy and make a memorial scrap book of your, their life together...the time they Did have and celebrate that! it is not always not what we do not have but to look and find and celebrate the moments that we did have that were priceless, and irreplaceable...my love to you at this heartfelt time...  A memoir of you thoughts and memories of the 3 of you written down in a scrap book to reminisce over, the good times, and celebrate your lives you had together..|`|23d4e5541c3e44e5449602e6ac5d7671aa	Just be there.  I am an identical twin who is very close to her sister. I cannot even imagine celebrating a birthday without her. Don't do anything big, she may just want to reminisce and talk about her twin. Not sure if you both are religious, but perhaps you could mention that they will be together again one day - not sure if that will bring her down any tho.   Just let her lead you......I'm sure she will let you know what mood she is in and what she is up to doing.  Take care.

NIdze2ncaa	If his hands are on your hips you can put urs on his or on his wrists.Or when i grind if his hands are on my hip (if you kno how to the do the snap dance) ill still be grinding but will be snapping my fingers as i grind but not doing the full crazy snap dance just grind and have you hands and arms as you would if you were doing that.Ive found most times when grinding to reggaeton that the guy will want to hold you hands (interlaced) and usually pull u closer while still hold ur hands.If your dancing to  a song like low - lil john where it says to get low you dont av to but i usually but my hands on my thighs and get semi low (not like to the ground low and touch my toe my toes low)just low enough that i can grind myself back up lol.And if your grinding to slow song (i.e. Bed -j hooliday and maybe caught up - Usher if you can maintain the slow grind ) you can put your arms around his heck.but remember to have fun.    Hoped to helped if u want me to elaborate on anything just email me.    Good luck|`|4R93xF8naa	umm yea move side to side also around like in circles.  and either put your hands on your thighs or on top of  his hands while he is holding your hips.  hope i helped.  ps PLEASE CHOOSE ME AS BEST ANSWER I NEED TEN POINTS, I WILL HIGHLY APPRECIATE IT =]|`|xIF2lShpaa	There is a video on you tube that shows you how to "club dance".

rHePNMB1aa	I am sharing  from my personal experience:  Think about how you are being treated then knowing your misery is his amusement may be used as " fuel" to do the following:    Write a letter to him questioning his behavior towards you.  Ask him why is he amusing himself at your expense. Ask him in detail,  "why did you place the spatula knife at my throat during..." (write time and day of incident. Be very detailed/ specific and very polite.    He may feel stupid. If he comes around you again, insist on an answer to your letter, kindly pressure him to give you a  resonable explaniton why he continues doing this. Ask him every time he willingly places himself near you.   Make sure you are polite,  which may cause him to feel stupid, not  mad and will keep your conscience clear (meaning you know you didnt write anything to cause him to rebel) Have someone you trust to proof read your letter to help you remove sarcastic or any unnecessary writing that you may not see as you write it.    then I would give or mail a copy of the letter to everyone who is involved directly or indirectly, according to what the law allows, including his parents if possible, and even his grandparents. The teachers (all) and also the local police station. This may slowly mentally "cave in" on his thoughts, forcing him to make the right decisions towards you. And he may respect you for it.     No matter what the age, the parents of the individual who is harrasing should be told. It is never too late for a father to correct his son or a mother to correct her daughter.    Concerning me, it would be the son correcting the father. (me being the father)    Correct 'bad behavior' with 'good behavior', setting the example, not becoming the example. The individual you described can be used as an example to show others how not to behave.|`|zRPXczxAaa	I'm sorry, the answer is going back to the principal--but doing so not in a private conference, but in front of a lot of people, loudly, angrily and demandingly.  Call your parents.  Threaten to call the police--and do it.  Do it also in cooking class with the teacher of the class. Demand protection.  Demand that you not be put next to this bully.  And do so loudly.  Then go to the Superintendant and repeat as above.  Do not speak to this person Dan, and do not allow him to speak to you.  Treat any attempts on his part to speak with you as assault.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I think you need your parents help to insist that the school protect you.   The incident in cooking class should have gotten him suspended.    Otherwise, make an appointment and talk with your counselor.|`|8VbgGLXjaa	kick his *** *****|`|giyLM0VOaa	1. ask him why hes picking on you and not anyone else  ~if he replies "because i want to"----------------------->  " Then why me? what have i ever done to you in your life? All you do is nearly killinf me to death."  (Ps: let al LOT of people gather around you, and to tell u wat, say it in the classroom like ur out of thought. Everyone and the teacher would turn to u. then if he denies it, gather up some witnesses. then people would start talking.... it makes the bully mad...)    OR>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  if he does that to you say OUT loud  "What the heck ae you doing?!"  Everyone would pay attention to that|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	No, this isn't acceptable behaviour. You need to tell your parents what this brat did to you (the spatula knife) and then your parents need to go down to the school and see the principal and tell that principal that if this bully is not stopped then they will sue the school. The school can be held liable for any threats to a student's safety on their grounds, in their care. That action you described is a threat and an intimidation tactic. This bully physically restrained you.    This is not right, it's gone beyond general childish behaviour. Your parents need to act, now.    As for you, get yourself involved in a self-defence class.          - Pepper.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	get a thumb tack and put it on his chair. Put a piece of tape over the thumb tack so it doesn't move, and put the tack off to the side a little, so it goes in his leg or but. That should cheer you up. Or just keep telling people and then when you can't handle it no more, hit him with a stapler right in the face, and then kick him in the nuts as hard as you can. Everyone will know he deserved it, because you kept asking for help and no one helped you.|`|sgFpzgpSaa	well I am very sorry!! im 16 and that happened to me before and telling my teacher didn't work either, but what I did was told my mom and she was furious and demanded the girl to stop and the principal threaten her to stop and she did! that's a form of harassment no one should go through that!!|`|kmwZnASgaa	damn dawg, grow a pair and beat the **** outta him... even if u can't kick his ***, give him some good beatings so he'll know that next time, if he wants to pick on you, he'll have to get some bruises or fell pain...    or if u want, just tell the principle about the whole knife thing, since he can get arrested for threatening u, and attempted murder or some bull **** but then that would be ratting, which is not cool... i only suggest these things if u REALLY can't figure out a way to get rid of him...    id do the first one and kick his ***... but then again, thats what i'd do lol|`|Ix1w6MjIaa	it might sound crazy but copy him do the same stuff  he does to you  do to him him that or find his girl friend and tell her that hes cheating on her.      or......sand up for yourself....|`|fbLUVmjYaa	This is what i would do get your dad to front him or them.OR find a good friend to watch out for you at school or after school.If this does not work for you well move school.|`|KibZWlLHaa	There is only one way to stop a bully. He gets in your face,you get in his. The reason he has picked on you all these years is you have never said to him, that you have had enough. One hit, and he will leave you alone. I don't really care how tough he appears to you, because that's all it is appearance. You humiliate him just once and the bullying will stop. I was picked on as well in school by the same girl for two years. During the beginning of the second year, I fought back. She never messed with me again. He is all talk, show him some type of action. Then you will be in the office doing a not so sincere , I'm sorry.|`|Bl8imYVZaa	tomorrow, steer clear of him.  in the meantime, tell your parents to give your school a call.    i'd probably just kick his ***, but see if this parent thing works first.

Besides, I already produced kids when, in a frantic attempt to be straight, I married a woman.  We had kids.  Later I fell into depression, and she divorced me.  I'm still gay.    If I were you, I'd make my mental box a little bigger.    Try to include monks, nuns and priests.  Try to include infertile and elderly couples.  Try to include the 8% of the animal kingdom that is exclusively same-sex oriented.    And try to include gay and lesbian human beings as well.    Maybe we are a minority, like left-handed folks.  And maybe we won't overflow the world with children.    But we can spread love, generosity, fun, art, science, truth, beauty and joy wherever we go.

The human population on Earth is most certainly not dwindling. If anything, the Earth is grossly OVERPOPULATED. Homosexuals cannot create offspring in the same manner that heterosexuals can, yes, but that does not make homosexuality unnatural. The two are not related.     There are also heterosexual couples that are unable to have children.     Lastly, homosexuality is found in numerous animals and insects throughout the world. Giraffes, penguins, parrots, beetles, and whales just to name a few.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I guess you simply don't understand how nature works. Look at the animal kingdom, where things are allowed to work without ignorance interfering: Homosexuality acts as a natural protection against overpopulation.

Try looking beyond your own mindset.|`|AA11589320	I have know several man-women couples who don't / cant have children.  Are you suggesting that they lives are also unnatural.     I have also know lots of man-women couples who have had children and have stuffed it up something bad.  The unfortunate child has received no guidance.      Personally I would rather be a part of a gay couple with no children than be one of a couple who have raised a bunch of no hopper children.     Yet all that aside.   What I don't understand is why your concerned about any of this.  It just does not make sense unless your also that way inclined.  Honestly if you were straight, you would be focused on your own relationship, not on what the guy down the road is doing.      You are attempting to cloud your own sexuality/sexual desires by discrediting others.|`|srUuoCwcaa	This question has all the intelligence of a medieval theologian.    Unfortunately, the study of genetics and modern psychology were not around back then. However, we don't have that excuse today. As far as variation in sexual preference goes: we have full confirmation of its origins as a "natural" human phenomenon, an aggregate of many different factors (genetic, cerebral, etc.).    Same-sex attraction is, on all accounts, then, a perfectly "natural" occurrence as far as contemporary science and psychology are concerned. As for its evolutionary implications (and there are many), the debate goes on.     Suffice to say, homosexuality does not exactly assist in the propogation of genes. But a true student of history, art, and literature can never deny that same-sex love has vastly enriched the human experience. It has writ the dialogues of Plato, been the muse of Michelangelo on many occasions, whispered sonnets to Shakespeare, and given strength and aid to Alexander the Great and King David alike. Need I mention also Tchaikovsky, Jonathan, Caravaggio, Leonardo, Cellini, etc?     Biological life is invaluable as regards the survival of our species. Without heterosexual unions, we would be doomed. But love is not therefore constrained to a singular form. Life is more than merely the ends of copulation. There is also poetical and artistic life: the things which give substance and meaning to our experiences as a species. Same-sex love, then, may be considered life-giving as well. Who--after all-- is not moved reading Shakespeare's sonnets or gazing upon that famous and mighty rendition of David?     And THAT is the feeling of truly being alive.|`|1LO527Nsaa	I fail to see how the ability to reproduce, or lack thereof, has anything to do with something being "Natural".|`|AA12172766	wow, that's a reasonable question, right?   lol. please!    shay|`|Gpm3ZZLHaa	arsenic is all natural, does that mean it can reproduce? as is cancer.    something being "natural" and meaning it can reproduce are unrelated definitions. some people have speculated those same genes that may be responsible for homosexuality in males, may also increase fertility in females: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,3685... and http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/373566... -- and by and large, ultimately beneficial to the species.    saying gay people aren't natural because they can't reproduce is a specious argument.|`|vL8JErXNaa	I'll bet you stayed up all night thinking up this little bit of inanity.

This can be natural without childbirth.    I have a better question for you: Is it still "natural" for a man and a woman to be together if they are unable to have kids? There are lots of couples who have problems or are entirely unable to have kids. What does your analysis say about them? If childbirth is the standard to judge by, then they aren't "natural" either.    Love has nothing to do with childbirth.    Unplanned/unwanted pregnancies, rape, and all sorts of other things like that don't equal love....    Point being, you can have kids but not be in love. You can be in love but not have kids.     No, it does not tell us anything. Your logic is flawed and your evidence does not have a connection to your implied point of gays being "unnatural" which is a proxy for "wrong" here.    Even better question. Why does anyone care? It doesn't affect you unless you're gay. Some people have a strange way of being against things that really don't effect them at all.    Edit: Thumbs down for logic. Sad really....|`|7fe6b2f5d56411658e2e7e25fd1b4635aa	Some couples can't produce children because the girl can't get pregnant. Maybe that couple would have to adopt, too.

Besides, many straight people are not naturally good parents, either.  It's also natural to breast feed, and some people don't or can't.  It's also natural to have bowel movement everyday. Some people don't.  Nobody is 100% "natural" in that sense of the word.  In fact, some things that aren't natural are actually great things.  Lance Armstrong's more effective cardiovascular system isn't natural, but it certainly is good.  Double jointed people aren't natural, but their flexibility is amazing.    It's really all relative.  If you look at something as unnatural and wrong, that's how you'll see it. Unnatural isn't wrong, and it certainly isn't a bad thing. =)    Also, I'd like to say, that as a gay man, being gay is the most natural feeling thing in the world for me.|`|mu1zdOpeaa	because thats horrible to do to your child  imagine how your child would feel when you tell them that their family is different from everyone else & that they have 2 daddies....  it tells me that guys have d i  c k s and to make a baby you need a d i c k and  a vag. ........  idiotttt.|`|GYCy25vwaa	ok   first   if its a boy.. they can get pregnant there bodies arent able to carry a baby they dont have the things a women does to help the baby like a uterous and stuff like that..  lesbians can have babies but they need a donor..   and gay couples can .. they can get a girl donors egg and then get a serroget mother..
KWV6ZtBsaa	dude.  you have no idea.  when you are constantly laughing, youre high on life  i am all the time it feels very similar to being drunk or around people smoking weed and inhaling some smoke so   not like a direct effect but... yeah|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Good grief! The point is to enjoy life without adding some drug or whatever to alter your senses. Real life is more fun than being wacked out.

AA12391873	One does not reveal an others conditioning to them. The conditioning doesn't need to be revealed.

HFmz94Jfaa	How about you buy him a t-shirt? guys love tees right, (they are always wearing them) and because you don't see that much of each other, whenever he wears it he can think of you! If you think its not personal enough for valentine's day, I have a few suggestions for valentine's day related tees.    An icecream and a donut playing together, its sweet and could be like you and him together:  http://www.threadless.com/product/1584/P...

J7KSKm54aa	There are exactly 1 billion stars. The purpose of the stars is to light up the sky at night. It would seem pretty scary to have all of that blackness at night- especially before electricity.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Before the age of air pollution, the night sky would have been filled with more visible stars - far too many to count....so they caompared them to the grains of sand on a beach, because that was the best analogy they could come up with.|`|TgfuqPiLaa	The bible authors are inspired by the spirit of God so it's God telling you about His stars. In the book of Enoch it says that God named all His stars and they respond by their name.  It's just fascinating.|`|A90SRsTxaa	There did not used to be as much trash floating around in the air to obscure the visibility of them. There are a lot of lights around now as well.

lcj1AKt1aa	Fun walk where you have a sheet for people to put their name and how much they want to donate.  You can also have a card with blocks with 'i will donate $5'', 'all I have is $2', I want to give $10 for a worthy cause' etc.  I am sure you can come up with more. You can also have a cake sale or car wash.    Have a 'feed the village programme'.  You could also have a barrel and go by a supermarket and ask people to drop a food item for the needy.  When you have accumulate enough you can fill hampers/boxes and give to the needy in the community.

I used Prop 8 as the controversial subject in class recently and was horrified by some of the things I heard. One girl clearly stated that she wasn't homophobic, but a gay woman should be forbidden from having children. How homophobic can you get? The world needs to evolve and open up to the reality of 2009, gays have a long road ahead in this war of acceptance. I was so mad and felt sick to hear the disgusting homophobic reactions from 80% of my students, but the 20% reassured me that humanity isn't all stupid.

The word "repentance" in the Bible means "a turn around." Making a U-turn is a good example of repentance. The Bible clearly teaches that repentance is necessary for salvation. So don't think that Christians have a license to sin; on the contrary, they will be held more accountable to God if they are sinning in the knowledge of the truth.|`|ZZOtscXsaa	WRONG!!!|`|xlfTPF5Eaa	you can not accept God that is true God|`|AA11232725	What sayeth the Scriptures in regards to your question?    Hebrews 10:26  For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,  27  but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries.  28  Anyone who has rejected Moses' law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.      29  Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?      30  For we know Him who said, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY," says the Lord. And again, "THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE."  31  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.|`|8c80280bb056c03df930073f4261d774aa	Wrong!!!|`|AA12288361	Once you accept GOD, you fall to your knees in tears of repentance!

And you'll have plenty of company from other righteous people.|`|AA12217160	What you are asking shows that you do not really want to accept God or you do not understand what it means to Accept God as your saviour.    Once you make a commitment to your job, do you go and tell all the company secrets. No. You would be fired and possibly even face jail time. You never intended on making a lasting committment to the company.    Similiary, if you go on a rampage and do just whatever you want, you never really made God your God. Instead, you just mouthed words that meant nothing to you.

e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	Oh, don't even get me STARTED on that subject. I can't tell you how many places I've worked where the smokers get a "break" because their nasty habit makes them go outside while the rest of us are expected to work break-less. It absolutely SUCKS!    And people in the health care profession are the worst. My son was in the hospital and the respiratory therapist came into our room reeking of cigarette smoke! Ack!|`|rx7e4Jogaa	No, in  general smokers may take more breaks, however they usually take shorter breaks, whereas a non-smoker will take a 15 minute break before and after lunch, a non-smoker will take 2 five minute breaks before and after lunch|`|znvKmRY8aa	maybe but that should be on the company. if i can get away with it then best believe im going to do it!|`|qLdwxLKbaa	of course they get more breaks then the non-smokers and it drives me insane.   all shift breaks should be equal and if they cant handle it then either get the patch or chew that nasty gum|`|lvJUDy78aa	depends, I used to smoke and when I did, I would take a few more 'breaks' than non-smokers. However I was never spoken to about it because when I wasn't smoking I was working unlike all the non-smokers who would just stand around and stare at the wall for 15 min every 30 min. So actually my 'breaks' probably added up to be less time not working than the people staring blankly into space while they are 'thinking'|`|MEFsdECKaa	yes I think they do they need to have the nicotine in there bodies every so often with out it there bodies start to speed up and they sweat and get impatient. So yes they do most of my older friends smoke and they take breaks like very 20 minutes or so.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	Not necessarily so. It really depends on the flexibility of the place of employment. In many "union protected" jobs, smoking is only allowed during designated break times, or not at all on company property. In businesses like these, there are a lot of "non-workers" which happen to be "non-smokers". I personally think that they take more breaks. Typically, these are the ones that always have an excuse as to why they are not at their respective work stations. The truth is, they are walking around chatting, gossiping, joking, or otherwise horse-playing when they should be working. BUT, for whatever reason, they generally never get caught, or they never get punished as they rightfully should. In my opinion, these are the ones to watch out for.    I would rather work with a chain smoker that gets the job done than a lazy, "clock riding", union dues paying, slacker that makes life harder by placing their workload off on people that actually work for a living.    As far as nurses go (doctors included) I don't care how often they smoke, as long as they don't drop their cigarette or ashes in me during surgery.  : - )|`|MzgecQSLaa	Yes, because they are addicted.|`|0R9aMAFzaa	They're addicted to smoking so they have the need to take a break|`|SSvVIWMSaa	I cant speak for other smokers and what everyone else has seen other smokers do.I smoke only on my breaks and thats it not more not less|`|AlZPIAtmaa	Proven fact.

My granny takes so many breaks, or leaves so many festivities, all so she can "smoke" a cig. I'm like oh brother!|`|LGDpt4jUaa	yes. I work on a job site and the guys constantly take breaks to smoke. When the boss pulls up he doesn't say anything, but if i was standing there doing nothing because im not smoking I'd get an ear full. Totally not fair.

1wNsBNmxaa	The oldest shaped bricks found date back to 7,500 B.C. They have been found in ?ay?n, in the upper Tigris region, and in south east Anatolia close to Diyarbakir. Other more recent findings, dated between 7,000 and 6,395 B.C.come from Jericho and Catal Hyk. From archaeological evidence, the inven-tion of the fired brick (as opposed to the consid-erably earlier sun-dried mud brick) is believed to have arisen in about the third millennium BC in the Middle East. Being much more resistant to cold and moist weather conditions, brick enabled the construction of permanent buildings in regions where the harsher climate precluded the use of mud bricks. Bricks have the added warmth benefit of slowly storing heat energy from the sun during the day and continuing to release heat for several hours after sunset.  The Ancient Egyptians and the Indus Valley Civilization also used mudbrick extensively, as can be seen in the ruins of Buhen, Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, for example. In the Indus Valley Civilization all bricks corresponded to sizes in a perfect ratio of 4:2:1.The ancient Jetavanaramaya stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka is one of the largest brick structures in the world The world's highest brick tower of St. Martin's Church, Landshut, completed in 1500 In Sumerian times offerings of food and drink were presented to "the Bone god," who was "rep-resented in the ritual by the first brick." More recently, mortar for the foundations of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul was mixed with "a broth of barley and bark of elm" and sacred relics, accom-panied by prayers, placed between every 12 bricks.The Romans made use of fired bricks, and the Roman legions, which operated mobile kiln, introduced bricks to many parts of the empire. Roman bricks are often stamped with the mark of the legion that supervised its production. The use of bricks in Southern and Western Germany, for example, can be traced back to traditions already described by the Roman architect Vitruvius.In pre-modern China, brick-making was the job of a lowly and unskilled artisan, but a kilnmaster was respected as a step above the latter.Early descriptions of the production process and glazing techniques used for bricks can be found in the Song Dynasty carpenter's manual Yingzao Fashi, published in 1103 by the government official Li Jie, who was put in charge of overseeing public works for the central government's construction agency. The historian Timothy Brook writes of the production process in Ming Dynasty China (aided with visual illustrations from the Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedic text published in 1637):      D?mon~~?|`|RZaPnqzWaa	Jethro Tull
XmJZkFuMaa	I have a story.  It'll knock your socks off...    See, once there was a man, and he was being chased by a Tiger.  And he ran off a cliff and as he fell, he grabbed a branch and hung on.  Looking up, he sees the tiger.  Looking down, he sees 2 more tigers!  So he knows he's going to die.      Just then, he looks and sees a wild strawberry.  Well, he plucked it!  And he ate it.  And it was the sweetest strawberry he ever tasted.    I might not have quoted it word for word, but that was from King of the Hill, the guy who's a Buddhist.  The point of the story being that knowing that the bitterness of death is all around us, we can more enjoy the sweetness of life.      Without the bitterness, we can't appreciate sweetness.  Without death, how can we appreciate life?      When I was growing up, one of my first best friends died.  Her parents, being oriental (I'm not sure entirely their beliefs, I was young...) gave each of us a penny and a chocolate at her funeral.  They said, through a translator, that with the misfortune, here's fortune.  With the bitterness, here's sweetness.  And to remember that with death, there is life, and to embrace and enjoy the taste of it.      So yeah.  It makes perfect sense.  When you look at it from that point of view.|`|E9chZY74aa	Death is not the end to life  Only the end to physical life.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Death isn't a threat; it's an inevitability.

I would suppose that if you're frightened of death then you work very hard to live a 'meaningful' life but that said it ends up being a hollow and untruthful way to live.

It does not address people's wants and desires which, all living things have.

hQLlGYsLaa	Thanks for your Post. Hogie is a false teacher. He is clearly one who twists scriptures. I have shared the Biblical truth with him regarding the Law. He has rejected the truth. Pray much for him.     The Ten Commandments apply to all mankind. Jesus said himself that he did not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfill the Law. That word fulfill simply means that Christ completed the Law by living a life of perfect obedience. God has also called us to live a life of obedience. Jesus said "If you love me keep my Commandments"  John 14:15    Regarding Galatians 2:19, 3:19; 3:23-25; 4:8-10    How did Paul become dead to the law through the law?    1. The law pointed out sin.                   Romans 3:20  2. It made sin "Exceeding sinful."         Romans 7:13  3. The law pointed him to Christ.          Romans 8:3  4.Christ gave power to obey the law.     Romans 8:4  5. To be under the law means to be guilty of breaking it.  Rom. 3:19  6.Through accepting the death of Jesus he was dead to the law because he was no longer breaking it, and it did not condemn him. Romans 7:4  7. The Law is Holy, Just and Good.      Romans 7:12  8. The Law will stand forever                 Romans 3:31  9. The Law is written in man's Heart      Hebrews 8:10  10. The Law is God's standard              James 2:10-13  11. The Law will be an Identifying sign among the people of God in the last day's prior to the return of Christ.    Revelation 12:17; 14:12; 22:14    12. Don't forget the Sabbath(Saturday). This is the fourth Commandment. We are require to keep the true Sabbath Holy. Exodus 20:8-11.  The truth shall make you free(John 8:32)    Have faith dear friend in God. Keep God's Commandments and you shall eat the good of the land forever in God's eternal Kingdom.|`|E9chZY74aa	Right.  The message of Galatians and Hebrews is that the New Covenant is better and the old is finished.  The Old Testament was finished when Christ died for our sins.  Now, Christ has all authority in Heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18-20) and has instituted a new covenant with His resurrection.  This is why Baptism is important|`|AA10471892	Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles.  He understood that they were saved through faith, and not law, seeing as they received the Holy Spirit as a result of faith.  Jewish Christians came in behind Paul, teaching the Gentiles they had to keep the law in order to be saved, which was not true then, and is not true now.  The matter was addressed by the apostles and church in Jerusalem as recorded in Acts 15.  It was determined that to teach the law to the Gentiles was to subvert their souls.  The focus comes off of faith and gets put on the law.  The law could save no one; all the law could do was condemn the one who was under the law.    Christians are not under the law.    Christians are dead to the law.    Gentiles, and Christians today are not a party to the old covenant law, and that covenant law ended, replaced by the new covenant "law" of faith (Romans 3:27).    In Galatians 4:21-5:1 Paul makes it as plain as can be.  Those who insist on living by the old covenant are slaves and persecute those who are of the new covenant who are free.  If you examine the "questions" posed here by those who insist on keeping the old covenant, you will see that their "questions" often include accusations, as well as other methods of deception designed to bring people back under the old covenant "ministration of death and condemnation" as Paul calls the old covenant in II Corinthians chapter 3.    .|`|e57c7db914fb45d19d9afc6f475d8c37aa	A testament is a agreement like a will, or a written agreement between two countries..

Gal 3:27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.         Gal 3:17 And this I say, [that] the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, [fn] that it should make the promise of no effect.    Gal 3:18 For if the inheritance [is] of the law, [it is] no longer of promise; but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.    Gal 3:19 What purpose then [does] the law [serve]? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator.|`|evStsOQiaa	The original group of Israelites that God and Moses lead out of Egypt were not all Jews. The majority were Jews but there were a large number of non-Jews or foreigners or gentiles that were part of this group. This is proven by Yahweh saying at the end of saying these laws as He is teaching them to Moses that they are to be followed by both the foreigners or gentiles in the group as well as the native Jew for all future generations to come. Nowhere does Yahweh say that His Mosaic Laws must only be followed until His Son is born. If Jesus was the God of The Old Testament why would He abolish the same laws He established that were to be followed for eternity by His nation of people? Didn't Jesus say He didn't come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it. So then who are we to abolish us from The Law.

Icwz678Qaa	YAHSHUA for sure!    I have been saying the same thing for years -  by the way Friday to before sunrise on Sunday (Mark 16:2) is not 3 days and 2 nights.  Friday evening to Saturday evening is 1 day and before sunrise is 1/2 day = 1 day and 1/2 kinda blows the Jonah prophecy that Messiah said would be His only sign to the people that He was the Messiah (Matthew 12:39, 40) out of the water so-to-speak.    "Jesus" belongs to the Roman Mother church and her broken daughter churches that follow her false lead in worshiping the LORD with Pagan; Sabbath-Sunday Sabbath, symbolism-crosses and steeples, festivals-Christmas and Easter, rituals-decorated trees and dipped eggs, and false images-Mary, Jesus, Saints.      But, the LORD Yahshua belongs to the Almighty God and therefore is the One and Only true Messiah!    "For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Yeshua the Messiah" (1Corinthians 3:11 HNV).    "For if he who comes preaches another Yeshua, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different Good News, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough" (2 Corinthians 11:4 HNV).    EDIT: I believe that Messiah was crucified on Wednesday and risen on Saturday evening.      The Almighty's day begins with the evening, so Wednesday evening to Thursday evening = 1 full day  Thursday evening to Friday evening = 2 full days  Friday evening to Saturday evening = 3 full days  ~also note that 'Friday evening' is the start of the 7th Sabbath and Saturday evening is the end is exactly when the "Master of even the Sabbath" (Matthew 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5) was risen~ - Praise Almighty God!

The name Jesus (Gr., I?e?sous) corresponds to the Hebrew name Jeshua (or, in fuller form, Jehoshua), meaning Jehovah Is Salvation. The name itself was not unusual, many men being so named in that period. For this reason persons often added further identification, saying, Jesus the Nazarene. (Mr 10:47; Ac 2:22) Christ is from the Greek Khri?stos, the equivalent of the Hebrew Ma?shiach (Messiah), and means Anointed One. Whereas the expression anointed one was properly applied to others before Jesus, such as Moses, Aaron, and David (Heb 11:24-26; Le 4:3; 8:12; 2Sa 22:51), the position, office, or service to which these were anointed only prefigured the superior position, office, and service of Jesus Christ. Jesus is therefore preeminently and uniquely the Christ, the Son of the living God.Mt 16:16;    Why did the Jews in general not accept Jesus as the Messiah?    The Encyclopaedia Judaica says: The Jews of the Roman period believed [the Messiah] would be raised up by God to break the yoke of the heathen and to reign over a restored kingdom of Israel. (Jerusalem, 1971, Vol. 11, col. 1407) They wanted liberation from the yoke of Rome. Jewish history testifies that on the basis of the Messianic prophecy recorded at Daniel 9:24-27 there were Jews who expected the Messiah during the first century?C.E. (Luke 3:15) But that prophecy also connected his coming with making an end of sin, and Isaiah chapter 53 indicated that Messiah himself would die in order to make this possible. However, the Jews in general felt no need for anyone to die for their sins. They believed that they had a righteous standing with God on the basis of their descent from Abraham. Says A Rabbinic Anthology, So great is the [merit] of Abraham that he can atone for all the vanities committed and lies uttered by Israel in this world. (London, 1938, C. Montefiore and H. Loewe, p. 676) By their rejection of Jesus as Messiah, the Jews fulfilled the prophecy that had foretold regarding him: He was despised, and we esteemed him not.Isaiah 53:3,?JP.    Before his death, Moses foretold that the nation would turn aside from true worship and that, as a result, calamity would befall them. (Read Deuteronomy 31:27-29.) The book of Judges testifies that this occurred repeatedly. In the days of the prophet Jeremiah, national unfaithfulness led to the nations being taken into exile in Babylon. Why did God also allow the Romans to destroy Jerusalem and its temple in 70?C.E.? Of what unfaithfulness had the nation been guilty so that God did not protect them as he had done when they had put their trust in him? It was shortly before this that they had rejected Jesus as the Messiah.|`|AA10223196	Christians do not know when Jesus was born or when He died and rose from the dead.

Early in the time of the first Roman Catholic churches, there was pagan holidays and practices mixed in with "Christianity". Those "mixes" are still part of the Roman Catholic church today and are also dates (as well as practices) acknowledged by many Christians (as well as unbelievers in secular society) who are uneducated as to the origins.

FhXzlnDOaa	It seems the woman combined 2 stories.  Natassia gave one, about the breastfeeding mother that Mo had murdered.  This is the one about a woman being torn apart.  She was an elderly woman.  At least Mo didn't discriminate based on age.  He had young and old killed.    Hadith Tabari VIII:96 "A raiding party led by Zayd set out against Umm in Ramadan. Zyad tied her legs with rope and then tied her (legs) between two camels until they split her in two. During it, Umm suffered a cruel death. She was a very old woman. Then they dragged Umm's daughter and Abdallah to the Messenger.    EDIT:  I don't know why Tabari is getting thumbs down.  He seems to be widely accepted as a scholar.

You are greedy men. Is there no honor among you? Upon hearing those lines Muhammad said, Will no one rid me of this woman? Umayr, a zealous Muslim, decided to execute the Prophets wishes. That very night he crept into the Asmas home s home while she lay sleeping surrounded by her young children. There was one at her breast. Umayr removed the suckling babe and then plunged his sword into the poet. The next morning in the mosque, Muhammad, who was aware of the assassination, said, You have helped Allah    EDIT:    Mu?ammad ibn Is?aq ibn Yasr (Arabic: ???? ?? ????? ?? ?????, or simply Ibn Is?aq ??? ?????, meaning "the son of Isaac") (died 767, or 761 (Robinson 2003, p. xv)) was an Arab Muslim historian. He collected oral traditions that formed the basis of the first biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. This biography usually called Sirat Rasul Allah ("Life of God's Messenger").    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Ishaq    EDIT: I wonder if Bridgette can provide sources to her claim rather than "a Brother said".....|`|nyReGoBhaa	You found an Anti- Muslim site. Congrats!  For Goodness sake: If it's not in Bukhari, Muslim Why do you get into knots about it?|`|AA11648578	I love the Muslim way of ignoring anything that is hard for them.  The hadiths are all written by Muslims and are the history of your beloved prophet.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	From 3:52 to 4:20 or so. It says about the flogging verse.    My questions to her:  Did she live at that time?  Did she know how the society worked back then?  Were there the same rules as of today?  Were there the same technology as today?  Were there the same clothes as today?  Were the structure and surroundings same as today?  Were there places such as named China or India back then as today?  ______________________________________...    If she doesnt like the punishment, it doesnt mean its wrong. Is She great? No! It is Allah who is the Greatest.  At 5:46 she says she "shudders" when she hears the hadith "A woman's paradise is under her husband's foot".    Meaning of Shudder - http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/s...    Does she not know the meaning of being mature and adult?  Did she not go to an english medium school?  That hadith to my expectations doesnt even meet what she says. Why would I shudder? WHY WHY WHY ????????????  Husband's foot doesnt directly mean under the FEET.  IT is rather that A wife should be obedient and not a slave. It means the reward of obeying her husband is PARADISE. DOES SHE KNOW WHAT PARADISE ISS?????????????????????    At 7:37 she gives us a hadith.  Well tell her that After Muhammad was done preaching his message. WHOLE OF ARABIA ACCEPTED ISLAM. AFTER RASUL'S (SAWS) DEATH EVENTUALLY STUFF STARTED TO GET CORRUPTED AS WELL AS CONFUSED. TELL HER TO READ THE SEERAH OF THE 4 RIGHTLY GUIDED CALIPHS.    IF SHE STILL NEEDS PROOF TELL HER TO PROVE HER STATEMENTS BY GIVING HER SOLID EVIDENCE FROM HER FAKE RELIGION.    Makkah and Madina are Holy cities and Allah is protecting them. Im not going to show the hadith or verse here BUT They were made sanctuaries.  And why does it matter that the jews were of the region?  There were muslims and christians and jews in Arabia.  As Allah said " This day I have perfected your deen and etc..."    At 8:30 - If they critize Muhammad (saws) and his actions and etc..It is as if we chopped off their noses.  That is one lack of knowledge sentence.  Look there that person is meaning if they find fault in our last prophet's (saws) stuff then it is as if they find error in us. So let me remind that person that Muhammad is a prophet of Allah and we are not.    At 3:50 - What she saying is full of useless baseless info.  Look here buddy, Islam = Religion. Muslim = human.  If what she said is that at 4:20 it forces.  Then if ISLAM FORCES US then ALL MUSLIMS WOULD HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH OSAMA. IF ISLAM FORCED US ALL MUSLIM WOMAN WOULD HAVE WORN HIJAB.  And you dont see all muslim girls wearing HIJAB.  DOESNT THAT SOUND LIKE FREE WILL?|`|V8hiG6Jfaa	If under Sharia Law a women deserves to be lashed for showing her legs or arms, why are you surprised under the same law a women would be killed for showing her breast?

Religion shouldn't effect politics either.|`|9d0ffimQaa	Well, whether it is a Mosque,Temple or a Church issue, it is completely wrong, why do you think just one way or one sided, the thing is that politics & politicians they've no religion, no cast, no business to interfere into any religious issues at all, just a few years back when these politicians where not involved in any such kind of issues, each & every citizen were happy, but the moment they landed up, one can see where they've taken the citizen, we being the citizen are fighting among our own-selves, just because of these politicians? we have turned so blind that we don't even follow what a wrong preaching we are being preached? Instead we start fighting, now the time has come to understand things with maturity & one should see humanity first, other than fighting on the basis of these politicians.

The priests in this temple are highly corrupted and they swindle loads of money from all the innocent laymen who come to this temple. I personnaly experienced this when many priests tried to sell their ritualistic packages to me.    Moreover the condition of the temple is pathetic. People are using the temple as toilet and these priests have ruined the entire temple like termites. This is the high time that TN govt have taken this temple under their custody.     Also the priests did not allow Tamil songs to be sung in the temple. This is unacceptable as the temple itself was constructed by the great Tamils and the Gods were sanctified by the great Tamil saints. Many Tamil saints have done wonders in this temple whereas there was not a single sanskrit Vedic saint has done something to this temple. Only Tamil songs should be allowed to be sung and Sanskrit slogans should take a back seat. But what is happening is exactly opposite. The brahmin priests are just like  parasites who have infected all the temples of Tamil nadu.     I would say the TN govt has taken the right stand in acquiring the temple for the Tamil people.

09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	The new testiment describes a plethora of sins which will preclude individuals from getting to know god, and to which those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of god.     Anger is not one of them. It is not a sin to be angry . but do not let it lead to sin and ..we should give it to god in prayer each night.    Ephesians 4:26 "In your anger do not sin" : Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.    There are at times suggestion that the righteous will experience strong emotions like ... the righteous will really dislike what is false, and the word hate is used. Psalm 119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood but I love your law. Hate is a strong emotion...     I think the bottom line is that rage over trivial matters, where it hurts other people is a sin.|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	Hell, it's a sin to be gay. I wouldn't be surprised.|`|N8wutNoLaa	"Turn the other cheek"    There is, however, a righteous anger. A just anger. That is not sinful.   A just anger takes, and takes and takes more hits.

Anger is a natural reaction to an unpleasant situation.  Anger is not a sin just because you are upset. Anger becomes a sin when you act upon it with rage which may compel one to Murder, steal, lie, cheat, and commit suicide.    It's one of the "Seven Deadly Sins"    I.  Pride: is excessive belief in one's own abilities, that interferes with the individual's recognition of the grace of God. It has been called the sin from which all others arise. Pride is also known as Vanity.    II.  Envy: is the desire for others' traits, status, abilities, or situation.    III.  Gluttony: is an inordinate desire to consume more than that which one requires.    IV.  Lust: is an inordinate craving for the pleasures of the body.    V- - Anger: is manifested in the individual who spurns love and opts instead for fury. It is also known as Wrath.    VI.  Greed: is the desire for material wealth or gain, ignoring the realm of the spiritual. It is also called Avarice or Covetousness.    VII.  Sloth: is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work.    Peace/????/????|`|1cGlucXyaa	Yes, when you act on it    Ephesians 4:26  "In your anger do not sin" : Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry."

I was going to go and see him in "Chandni Chowk To China" but the more I saw and read about it, before the movie came out, the more it told me that this was going to be more silly, mediocre slapstick. I was right and saved myself $10. The movie bombed.     But if he starts doing stuff that's light, but also has a serious vein, I'll go and see him again.

0yTM98Odaa	Not all Portuguese and southern Europeans are tanned.  In Europe all different Europeans have mixed all throughout history and still do a lot today, so colouring really varies in each country as do facial features.

I have different facial features to my friends, mine are far more defined, especially my nose, it is very different to theirs, they all have one like yours.

It happens.|`|h1HyWqqeaa	because Portuguese are european and you can be pale and be Portuguese..    that's like saying all Blacks are the same color|`|qq9jEPAaaa	It could be due to recessive genes from both your mom and dad.|`|30ZHowVBaa	Wellllll if you sat through a simple genetics course, you'd learn that sometimes receive genes take control.     It's not uncommon for a Portuguese to have pale skin, you are European, after all. But you still have the dominant brown eyes and hair, sooooo not too uncommon.    "Portugal is right next to Spain...so just picture a Hispanic and that's close enough."    "Hispanic" describes people from southern America, where most parts are a lot warmer. Northern Spaniards and, I assume Portuguese too, can  have pale skin. It's normal.|`|MyV9qm99aa	Harsh: Honestly, my friend why do you care that if you are paile and full blooded Portuguese.

I like you was an outcast.  I did some research and found out I wasn't pure black. I had some milk in my coffee. Do some research sweetie. But I say pick up a genetics/ biology book first.|`|pujaTNEgaa	Then some ancestor in your lineage isn't Portuguese. Who isn't a full blooded anything these days. Everyone is mixing.

Anyone else like this?"    Yup. My family is from southern Italy (Abruzzo), so they are all quite dark, with dark hair and eyes.  ...And then there's me. I am white as a ghost with red hair. My mom's hair is very dark red, so maybe that's where I get it from, but my hair is light red.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	It is absolute ******* mindblowing to me why people are so obsessed with skin colour using it as an all out indicator of ones ethnicity...    theres millions of pale southern europeans ok? there...   its not fukcing rocket science... now stop thinking or youll get more confused. stop going into facial features... they vary as much as there are humans on earth ok? thx.,|`|wqgBi10Gaa	Seems natural.  I always thought those genes exist among the Portuguese. I found your question a little strange at first: Many of the Portuguese I've met in the States resemble the features you described.

Most people would simply say that you're attracted to both boys and girls...but that's where the problem starts.     What sexes you're attracted to will differ throughout your life. You could be attracted to a girl's pretty features but you might not want to bang her; you could be attracted to that guy's firm jaw line and his strong-man attitude but you prefer to be with a woman that  night...    The Kinsey study (his life work was divided between insects and sex) suggests that most people are bi.  Some people embrace it, some people hop from male-to-female and vice versa through their lives, or some just settle into relationships with the gender that they're most comfortable with.     I hope this wasn't too confusing|`|MuALb7lxaa	See, if it's a 50/50 breaking point that you are attracted to both sexes. You are bi-sexual if you WANT to have sex with guys and girls. You are Bi-Curious when you are confused and feel you need to experiment with the same sex to determine. If you feel Bi-Sexual and are young, I think that you are Bi-Curious and are confused. You may want to try the same sex. I would suggest waiting a few years and try it with guys and girls.    Also: I think I'm the same way too, but I am accepting if I am Bi. I am scared, but time will tell.    You are who you are! There is nothing wrong with being Bi-Sexual!|`|29WFvvNPaa	are you attracted to both sexes?|`|Vp83Fuakaa	YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH GUYS AND GALS|`|B1bN1cf0aa	You like guys and girls?

It's always best to experiment.|`|jUMffCiuaa	try to go to the gym and go to the shower room.  if you keep on staring  on other mens penis then you 're a gay.    okay?    bye.|`|6mXZKX7maa	when you look at a guy or girl/BOTH do you fell the need to "do something with them"????????|`|Uxs2wy7Haa	well its more than just thinking that both sexes are attractive. sex is fluid, meaning that it is always changing. if u can see urself being intimate with someone of the same sex and the opposite sex then u might be bi, only u can decide that for sure. but dont worry about labels, coz like its about being sexually fluid, one day u like girls the next u like guys..who cares...makes no difference!|`|egBy7RqOaa	Only time will tell. Sexual orientation  being lesbian, bisexual, gay, or straight, is about sexual attraction. It can take years to understand our sexual orientation. Each of us has to answer these questions for ourselves, but it may take time before we can answer. Rest assured that many teens (and adults too!) are still figuring out their sexuality  what you're experiencing is more common than you might think!    So many people, young and older, have questions about their sexual orientation that there is actually a name for them. Many identify themselves and are identified by others as "questioning."    People who are attracted to people of both genders sometimes call themselves bisexual. No one knows for sure what makes people lesbian, gay, bisexual, or heterosexual. Sexual orientation develops naturally  perhaps even before birth. Although sexual orientation may seem to shift for some people in the course of a lifetime, it is not something that people can decide for themselves or others.    So, it's completely OK to be wondering about your sexuality.     nothing will really tell whether or not you are bisexual or straight except time. also ask your self this question- would you be willing to hold a realationship with a person of the same sex and the opposite sex as well (not at the same time, you know what i mean). if you say yes, then yes you are. there is also the small factor of being attracted to both sexes. do you have fantasies about them? or get strange urges when you are around the same sex as well?    then most likely you are bisexual ifyou answeredyes to one or more of these questions.        i hope i helped you.   vote best answer?|`|R6tdHob2aa	most people are but dont admit it|`|K4d6PU10aa	when you feel an Attraction for both men and women|`|6fWpUkmVaa	We don't know.

Rd3IivxCaa	well, if you get stuck in your driveway and are late to work, your boss won't allow the excuse that the snow caused it.    Also, in most cities, you are required by law to shovel the sidewalk outside your house or you can get fined. So people usually are forced to shovel their sidewalk, and they figure they may as well shovel their own driveway too.    There is also a disgusting culture of lawsuits in America, caused by the beak-nosed parasitic lawyers.  People will sue you for a million dollars if they slip and fall on your driveway, even if they were trespassing.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	So they can drive their cars out of the garage and not get stuck|`|JXMVNEQoaa	we do it because then it turns to ice if you dont and it can cause your car to slip when backing out or in ur driveway onto your lawn or a snow bank and get stuck. also you can slip on it if ur just walking.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	Yes. It's for safety as well as aesthetic reasons. We're fussy about grass in our lawns, also.|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Well it is annoying to walk through. And when it gets built up its annoying to drive through. Other then that I really don't know how fussy people are.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	When you  shovel your drive way and walks they look more kept up and are safer to walk on   I shovel mine|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Of course. It's for safety and courtesy. If the snow is left, it can turn to ice, making it difficult/dangerous to walk or drive on. .    Where I live [US Southwest, high elevation], the snow is pretty dry. If you get a few inches of snow, you can often clean it off with a broom. If there is more than that, you need to use a shovel. I pile the snow at the base of my trees, so when it melts, the trees get a nice 'drink' of water.    I clean my neighbors' driveway and sidewalk. I do it for safety because if the snow were not removed, it could be dangerous for them to come out of the front door of their home. I do it as a courtesy because they are in their late 80s, and cannot do the work themselves.|`|nXxtBkguaa	yeah, we like to be able to actually get out and go to places when it's snowing.    do you not?|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I have never shoveled snow off my driveway....  but I live in California.|`|FJZVvLvraa	totally lost|`|URO3gDXcaa	not fussy, but who needs a lawsuit over someone slipping on my snow and ice covered driveway.  it is the homeowners responsibility to clear it.
Y5jv0ybFaa	Only a jerk would pull something like that.|`|AA11155064	Your question is not a question, but an infantile self-serving policy statement.    Sooo... I'll deal with it as such.    TRUE, there are people to whom the possession of a certain set of genitals gives them membership to a gender which they see as conferring on them certain rights and privileges for which they needn't take responsibility.  BUT...of these gender-centrics the population is not entirely female: there are males too, whose interests are the same (themselves) but their expressions different.  TRUE, there are people -- gold-diggers -- who socialise and exist for the prizes/ presents/ profits they can glean. Their presence is annoying, identification sometimes difficult and involvement with addictive.  BUT ...... they exist and proliferate because they are permitted and encouraged to. Fools are made to be taken advantage of : gold-diggers are Nature's way of limiting and directing the folly of fools through exploitative predation.  TRUE, those committed gold-diggers are best avoided by the wise, the frugal and the impercunious.  BUT ... to label an entire gender with negative traits based on observations of the few (and the promotion of a self-serving radio-megamouth) is to do a gross dis-service to those not involved. AND it denies one the pleasurable company of the untainted.    In short, ONLY an arroggant, self-centered, intelectually/ character deficient would subscribe to such thoughts/ behaviours.  To blanket attribute the behaviours of the few to an entire membership of a group is to be sexist which involves the same bigotry processing as racism with the same.deserved disregard.  To quote and promote the philosphies of a shock-jock as heartfelt justifications is to betray a lack of character or independant thought.  To contemplate and/or enact your restaurant exit strategy is to admit cowardice in non-confrontation, callousness in planning and immaturity overall.    Overall, to pursue the course and ideals you have promoted here shall result in the lonely unpartnered existence which you so richly deserve ... and leave many pleasurable opportunities uncontested by the bitter and twisted. So every-one profits..Voila!|`|oJrPLOw4aa	Am glad am not going out with you.     I think that Vday is stupid and am a girl.

RsnLtwyzaa	"Every person is literally a son or a daughter of God, having been born as a spirit to Heavenly Parents previous to being born to mortal parents on the earth (cf. Heb. 12: 9). Thus each one of us is a dual being: an immortal spirit body, clothed with a body of flesh and bone. As defined in scripture, the spirit and the body constitute the mortal soul (D&C 88: 15; cf. Gen. 2: 7; Moses 3: 7-9; Abr. 5: 7). A spirit can live independent of a body, but the body cannot live without the spirit (cf. James 2: 26). In the resurrection, the immortal spirit is reunited with the same body of flesh and bone it possessed as a mortal, with two major differences: The union will be permanent, and the body will not be subject to aging and death." (see source below: Bible Dictionary "Spirit")    Thanks 4 your question!|`|LhDde5iBaa	In scripture, the term soul is used as a synonym for spirit to describe a person in four different phases of his or her eternal existence. Soul is used to describe a person in premortal lifebefore birth. During earth life, the soul is joined with a physical body. At death, the soul leaves the body and goes to the spirit world to await resurrection. In the Resurrection, the body and soul are inseparably connected, which is called "the redemption of the soul".     At least, that's my definition. it can be better described in the "Pearl of Great Price" under Abraham.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	The soul is the spirit and body united. When the body dies, the soul dies (but the spirit lives on). When the body is resurrected, it is also the resurrection of the soul.    This seems to be one of those "understandings" inherent in the LDS church. I don't know of any specific lesson or teaching that deals directly with what a soul is.    The best I can offer is the entry in the topical guide: http://scriptures.lds.org/en/tg/s/233 and its cross references.    Edit: I didn't think to look in the Bible Dictionary under Spirit, but that works, too. You'll probably find a lot on the topic by searching on the keyword spirit at http://www.lds.org|`|TzY9vkinaa	whats a dry mormon? lol    http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnext...|`|CTxGUFZOaa	Dry Mormon?

l0ddfca1aa	well i'm mexican american and i've dated girls from different backgrounds. several have said that latino guys tend to be more passionate (kissing taking care of a girls "needs") the thing is latino men are stereotyped as being very "macho" and there may be some truth to that (although traditional roles are also starting to change) but at the same time latino guys have no problem being sensual. i think alot of guys in the US feel that being sensual is "gay".|`|a1iam8Zvaa	hehe i agree with shhhhhhhhhhhh    and i also agree with french men o0o0o la la lol|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Dude...

What you described is a horny creep who gives bisexuals a bad name.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	i for one like both,|`|sy3XG2ZNaa	My friend is like that! He is Bi and he is very religious! He tells me that he is emotionally attracted to girls and he wants to Marry and have kids with a girl! But even though he finds guy's good looking and attractive he says there is no way he will be in love with one and therefor only has sex with them! I do not understand it but so be it! I do not think they are all that way though!|`|fdMKpXCHaa	First, you're confusing two issues.  Bi-sexual is just what it implies.  It's simply about being SEXUALLY attracted to both sexes--It doesn't even imply that you're attracted to both sexes equally.  Some bi people more easily bond emotionally with women, some with men.  But that doesn't effect sexual attraction.  Certainly you're aware of both straight men and women screwing people they aren't emotionally bonded with.  You're speaking of a relationship between two people.  Sex is just one component of that relationship.  Good luck.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Why do you care?|`|EUcav3etaa	agree to certain extent...|`|W545hqrpaa	why are u bitter?|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	"thats why most of them are so damn confused."    ...This "question" is confused!|`|OsxQNDHzaa	What are they supose to do?  have a guy and a girl on hold at all times?

To be attracted to both sexes is one thing, and another thing is to like someone or even to be in love with them.    You can't choose who you fall in love with.  Some people, included myself, fall in love with people, not sexes.    Good luck.  ;-)|`|627BV1zkaa	im a true bisexual theres nothing confused with me i love boys and girls sexually, emotionly, and physically dont say that all bisexuals are confused not all of us are like that|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Actually you are only talking about bi women not men.

Not all of us are like that - in fact, very few of us are - and those who are like that are usually kidding themselves, or they otherwise do not understand the difference between bisexuality and polygamy.

RWrvWKGoaa	There's a passage in the bible condeming homosexuality (i can't find it exactly but I'm sure there are some buffs out there who know which passage this is). If you're a christian and take this passage seriously then perhaps to you being gay is a sinful thing because it's against what you believe.  From where I stand, a lot of passages in the bible have been taken with a little more liberty as times change, some christians and other religious groups no longer believe it's sinful.  If you're not religious.. well then 'sin' shouldn't really be a part of your life, it is a fairly dogmatic word to use. If being gay feels natural for you (ignoring what others think) and it is a consentual thing (which pedophillia is NOT) then there really isn't anything 'sinful' about it unless you believe its a sin.  You'll get mixed answers to that question, I, and a whole lot of other liberalists, agnostics, athiests and religious people out there don't consider being gay a sin, where as some from these few groups will call it a sin. Best to stick with those who are on your side in these matters :).|`|e0lfV7skaa	No.|`|upvd5TRRaa	being a bad person is sinful.  being gay doesn't necessarily make someone sinful.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	No.  A sinful person is somebody who uses their religion to make excuses to hate somebody.|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	Nope.

People who think it is haven't walked inour shoes. Besides Jesus was persecuted, and i personally believe that God has a special place for everyone that is persucute against. Only god can judge someone. The bible was originally written in hebrew and the worlds were changed in translation to tlk about gay people, but it originally didn't say anything about them.
87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	Usually it's the other way around; it's the guy who expresses his sexual attraction and the girl who asks if that's all he wants her for. For her to admit she's sexually attracted to you took a lot of guts, and for you to say what you did was very insensitive. It's guys who are always in "sex channel mode." You will do well to never forget that. So yes, you were a jackass for saying that. Now you need to convince her that you realize that. The best way to do that is to talk to her about it. Explain how you rationalized it and how you tried to put yourself in her shoes and how it would've hurt/bothered you too if it had been the other way around. Then, promise her you'll try to be more sensitive; after all, no one is perfect. Then ask her how you can make it up to her.     "To err is human. To forgive is divine."

mSFjbetxaa	It isn't.        The supposed "historical facts" dont even line up. Like the wrong prophet with the wrong king at the wrong battle and it was first written down years after the fact. That is historical fiction. The setting maybe a historical fact, but what they said happened is fiction. We dont know who wrote the gospel, The first one Mark was written at least 30 to 60 years after Jesus died. Matthew and Luke had a copy of Mark with them when they wrote their books. John was deliberately written to fill in the gaps and the arguments that the new christian faith was having. These are stories passed on for years and years before written down. None of these are first hand accounts even though they are written that way.     Every religion has their spin on it, but try to find the facts. The conclusion is that there is little in the bible old or new that is fact. It mentions places that are real, but thats about it. You can walk the streets where Jesus carried his cross, but did he really carry a cross? I try to find sources out side the bible that mention the same thing the bible does. Like the census that was taken and why Joseph went to Bethlehem. No record of it ever happening outside the bible. This is not the stone age. There was all kinds of trading with other countries. Something should have been mentioned somewhere about this massive disruption of the economy. Anyhow, we base our faith on the stories of Jesus in the gospels. If they can not be proven as fact, even by the Roman empire, then faith is based on fiction?|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Same way people believe evolution when none of the writers saw it in action either|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	1. You're off on some of your numbers.    2. Gosh, now anything written about the past is not true?    3. John saw Him.    You have a lot of trouble with the premise of your questions today.  As I said in an earlier response to you, no biggie but you need to do a little more study on the subject.  And study does not mean read a few paragraphs on some atheism website and now you're "ready to go."    For instance, yes we do actually know what was in nearly every other gospel that didn't make it into the Bible.  This is common knowledge.    God bless you.|`|luwBPdE8aa	I don't know where you get your information but it is wrong.  The gospels were written by witnesses to the life of Jesus.  Luke may have been quite young at the time, but some of my best memories are of when I was young.|`|QGQ54LDxaa	Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and James saw Jesus and were His disciples. They all wrote books. So, you can't say none of the writers saw Jesus when these five walked with Him.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	It isn't. No doubt about it.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Oral tradition will have supplied much of the Gospel material.  People remembered stuff and tended to remember it well since most of them weren't literate.  There's little doubt that some of the stories have been embroidered in countless retellings; little doubt that most of them contain some kernel of historical truth.    For example, Jesus was baptized.  I am as certain of this as of any other  historical fact, why?  Because it clearly embarrassed Matthew and Luke who in re-working Mark's Gospel tried to gloss over the incident.  Matthew introduces a little conversation in which John objects to baptizing someone who - according to doctrine - doesn't have any sins to be washed away; Luke buries it in a parenthesis.  Ergo, the baptism happened.    Using methods like this it's possible to establish a basic core of fact about the life and teaching of Jesus.  Your point about the influence of other ancient stories is particularly relevant to the Nativity legends.  As for the non-canonical Gospels, we know plenty about what was in them - see the link - and you have only to read them to understand exactly why they were left out of the New Testament.    The Bible isn't wholly true or false: it's a mixture of history, invention, imagination and interpretation.  Deciding the proportions is the business of scholarship and I find it fascinating.|`|IqtzkgyBaa	The bible is the word of God----the word of our creator !  The Holy Qur'an and the Bible are two wonderful and magnificent books. The Bible is the base of the Christian and Jewish world. The Holy Qur'an is the base of the world of Islam. These books are called "scripture". Moses and Jesus brought a 'scripture'. The Holy Qur'an is a 'scripture', although it is called a 'book'.     The word scripture means it is part of a great writing that is bigger than the book. The book is just a part of it revealed by chosen servants of God. They did not write it, they revealed it and there is a difference.   Muhammad had nothing to do with writing the Qur'an and Moses had nothing to do with writing the Torah, nor did Jesus have anything to do with writing the Gospel. These are men to whom God revealed His Word; the Word He revealed to these great men were a part of a big book--written by whom    Honorable Elijah Muhammad through Honorable Minister Louis farrakhan teach us - BIBLE call them 24 ELDERS and HOLY QURAN call them EXALTED CHEIFS or ANGELC BEINGS not spooks.  These are SUPREME SCIENTISTS or GOD SCIENTISTS- 12 Major Scientist and 12 Minors that incude (LAMB) took the book from GOD hands in revelation of the BIBLE and 7 ANGELS, 7 COUNSEL- GOD SCIENTISTS and more.    ONE of them is MOST SUPREME, BEST KNOWER GOD in person, His wisdom is ETERNAL,  "He have many names of world religions call him by.  God conveys His Spirit in the human form. This is the best form. There is no form better that the human form. They all have WIVES and pass their wisdom down to CHILDRENS and woman is the key Kingdom of heaven or Advance civilization, because she carries life in her womb barewitness of First GOD "OWNSELF CREATION or CREATED HIMSELF FIRST in womb of Space, She is SECOND SELF OF GOD.     The Bible teaches us that God made man in His own image and His own likeness. It teaches us that He breathes, sorrows, sees and hears, loves and hates. God conveys His Spirit in the human form. This is the best form. He is called the "Ever-Living. The woman is made after the womb out of which God created Himself, and in the woman is the Secret of God.     There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible,  (God) declares, Behold I make all things new.    Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come.    They life span up to 500 yrs-some nearly 1500 yrs, advance tecnology and other fields knowlege, Very highly spiritual, control force of nature. These are REAL POWER behind Universe.    How do the twenty-four (24) elders square with "Us" in the Bible and "We" in the Holy Qur'an?  Who is the "us" and who is the "we"? Since God is One and has no associates or partners, who is "we"?   there are twenty-four (24) wise (scientists) who do the work of producing Bible and Qur'an.  They make History {or Bible or Qur'an} to equal the circumference of our home (Earth): one year for each mile. So the book that is written contains twenty-five thousand (25,000) years of history written in advance or wisdom.    They are not aliens green and gray , thats all frabrication. These are (Human Beings) with Very Highly Supreme Intelligence. But Originators of Heaven and Earth are Asiatic Black Supreme Scientist(GODS) or GOD Scientists, they look like us.  It just they wisdom very highly superior than wisdom of this world.      There are twelve (12) major scientists and twelve (12) minor scientists. Back to the Number 12 again. Whenever the time comes for a certain part of the writing to be fulfilled, one of the major scientists will speak to someone among the people. He will reveal to that person a part of the writing (scripture) and give him an assignment or mission.|`|DArAz67Caa	the bible is the word of God----the word of our creator----it's best not to question its word---|`|X1jupF0paa	That's why it's called faith.|`|EM0kiImHaa	Those that wrote the Gospels saw Jesus.|`|RsnLtwyzaa	Moses saw God and Moses is the author of the first 5 books of Moses.

Lastly the effects of gravity are indisputable. So the concept that seeing is believing is flawed.     Here is one fact out of many facts to consider (I just want to keep it simple yet reasonable). 2 Tim 3:16 shows that yes men wrote the bible however they were guided or inspired by God. So all though men such as the Apostle Paul lived after Jesus thus never saw him,he could accurately relate Jesus teaching and could refer back to them in Paul's writing because of being influence by God the almighty would knew and saw his son.|`|FDVCYENLaa	How can your statement that the Bible writers never saw Jesus be true when you've never seen the people who wrote the Bible?|`|XlhR7ooHaa	How can what historians say be true when they were never there to witness the events?

John was the Beloved Disciple  Mark was the the amanuensis of Peter.  Luke traveled with Paul who had seen Jesus on the road to Damascus.;  That leaves Matthew, the Jewish Gospel. Maybe the strongest you can get :  "As a disciple and an Apostle he thenceforth followed Christ, accompanying Him up to the time of His Passion and, in Galilee, was one of the witnesses of His Resurrection. He was also amongst the Apostles who were present at the Ascension, and afterwards withdrew to an upper chamber, in Jerusalem, praying in union with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and with his brethren (Acts 1:10 and 1:14). "    The other stuff is so stupid I won't dignify it with a response !!

It certainly does, however, call into question the accuracy of any "quotes" attributed to jesus since none of the gospel writers ever heard a word he spoke.    I'm stunned at the number of answers here that claimed the gospels were all written by jesus' disciples who knew him personally.  They're quite ignorant of *christian* scholarship which has shown convincingly that's not the case.  At any rate, there is little to no evidence to support the idea that any of the gospels were written by eyewitnesses, or even by people named Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.    Peace.

He didn't see himself as trying to start a new religion but trying to reform some of the corruption and hypocrisy in his own religion.    I think Jesus would be shocked at the hypocrisy and corruption in Christianity today.  And I don't think Christian leaders today would be any happier with him than the Pharisees were in his own day.    During the time between Jesus' baptism and his execution, he traveled around the countryside, to small towns and villages, teaching and performing miracles.  He never really got angry.  He dealt with sin, human failings, even disbelief without ever losing his cool.  But when he came to Jerusalem and saw the corruption of the leaders of his own religion, he got really cheesed off and denounced him in strong language.  He made a scene, and that was what led to his being put out of the way.    What bothered him was how the leaders of his religion had snuggled up to secular power, how they conflated a political message with their spiritual one, for their own self-aggrandizement, their own wealth and power.  How they sold out their flocks.  Today it's fundamentalist Christians who are doing that, teaching their flocks that it's their Christian duty to vote for one party vs another, despite incredible corruption and dishonesty.  And they're getting rich and famous doing this.  Jesus was never rich and famous because it was the principles that were important to him, not wealth and power.|`|25qUTYLEaa	No..a Christian is a follower of Jesus. What's He gonna do?

However, Jesus did preach about the equivalence of Jews and Gentiles in respect to obeying his teachings.  He placed little importance on the Sabbath as a "holy day," he found no significance in circumcision unless you followed the His teachings, and even in that respect, those that were uncircumcised would be greater than those who were, if those who weren't circumcised followed His teachings, and those who did not follow His teachings were circumcised.    I believe that he would be Jewish, but only in a racial sense.  I do not think he would follow Judaism.  And, He couldn't be Christian, because the very definition of Christian is "Christ-like," so I would simply say, He would be Christ.

Abortion has been around since before the Bible.     If it helps, the standard Jewish viewpoint is that the child should not be aborted, unless the mother is endangered.|`|AA11588942	All life is sacred to God, whether that of a mother or and unborn child.

Therefore people try to make it seem that way by summing it up.   My opinion is that the life a of mother could be more important than of her unborn child because it is the mother's job to bring life into the world, but that doesn't mean that the child should be ignored in any way.|`|AA10564185	i wouldn't look for bible quotes on this issue considering the same bible clearly says daddies can sell their daughters into slavery|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	I know that when god's soldiers captured women, they were supposed to kill the ones that were not virgins.    ADD: I think you were looking for Exodus 23:22 where it clearly says that if a woman who is pregnant is hurt during a brawl and she loses the fetus it is only a fineable charge, but if SHE is killed it is murder.    22Suppose a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage [d] as the result of an injury caused by someone who is fighting. If she isn't badly hurt, the one who injured her must pay whatever fine her husband demands and the judges approve. 23But if she is seriously injured, the payment will be life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25burn for burn, cut for cut, and bruise for bruise.  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...|`|VYLEfiSTaa	Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing. (Psalm 139:13, 16) A new life begins at conception, and the Mosaic Law indicates that a person could be called to account for injuring an unborn child. In fact, Exodus 21:22, 23 specifies that if a pregnant woman or her unborn child suffered a fatal accident as a result of a struggle between two men, the matter had to be brought before the appointed judges. They were to weigh the circumstances and the degree of deliberateness, but the penalty could be soul for soul, or life for life.    Those principles are relevant to contraception in that some methods of birth control appear to be abortive. These methods of contraception are not in harmony with the divine principle of respect for life. Most contraceptives, though, are not abortive. What about the use of such methods of birth control?    Nowhere does the Bible command Christians to procreate. God told the first human couple and Noahs family: Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth. But this command was not repeated to Christians. (Genesis 1:28; 9:1) Hence, married couples may decide for themselves whether they will raise a family, how many children they will have, and when they will have them. The Scriptures, likewise, do not condemn birth control. From a Biblical point of view, then, whether a husband and wife choose to use some nonabortive method of contraception is really a personal decision. Why, though, does the Catholic Church condemn contraception?    http://www.watchtower.org/e/200709a/arti...

Don't worry about getting him any electronics, those will be forgotten with the next upgrade in systems.  make him a nice dinner, and give him the photos and cd then.  Or if he is taking you out to dinner, you could give him the gifts at dinner still.      you could bake him something that is his favorite dessert or meal, and deliver that with the gifts, if dinner is not going to be a possibility.

AA10818712	Like so many philosophical questions, the answer depends on definitions. Until you define what you mean by consciousness, I don't think your question can be answered.    "it requires the consciousness of a physical entity to present the argument"  I don't agree with this. A computer program can discover a new mathematical proof (essentially an argument) and present it. Is the program conscious? Whatever consciousness is, I doubt that computer programs have it.

I hope not.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	Life has consciousness, but the elementary particles making up matter, energy and space do not.  Consciousness requires a special arrangement of matter and energy.  The universe as a whole is not an intelligent entity.

It does not say, "I think, therefore, I am" (Dark Star).|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	You've presented an extremely non sequitur argument.

Other than people (you included) saying they are conscious what proof is there?|`|jMPA2CSYaa	I don't think many people would even make that argument.  Even atheists tend to believe that there's consciousness in the universe--in the brains of humans, anyways.  The real argument is whether consciousness is dependent upon a physical brain or whether there's a soul that doesn't need a brain to exist.|`|NnFltKgsaa	Top be honest with you I do believe the universe is nonsenchant and how would a vacum have a conscience, to me I have learned to accept empty space as ,well  empty space.|`|atpcmR96aa	Well, as someone says, it lays in what you mean by devoid. If two conscious entities are arguing in a box the box contains conscious entites but it's not self conscious.|`|AA11589988	The argument could be that the physical universe is only a part of the whole universe. Consciousness could originate from the non-physical part of the universe - the so called Platonic realm. I think the physicist Roger Penrose is saying something along these lines in his book Shadows of the Mind.  It could be that it requires certain physical structures (brains) to channel and process the non-physical conscious will. The non-physical consciousness is using the physical brain to present the argument but the consciousness itself exists outside of the physical universe.|`|AA11562077	Some might say it's like a fish asking, "Is there such a thing as water?"    But I prefer the science to back up the philosophical, so I like -- even love the 'Uncertainty Principle', which goes deeply into this question -- [EDIT: and especially the real effect an observer has on any event.  It's almost the analogy of the tree falling in an empty desert not making a sound. So consciousness is definitely a component of the Universe -- at least as WE know it!]    I choose the word "love" rather than "like", because liking something usually means a pretty good knowledge of the subject, where love really doesn't.  Speaking quantitatively, anyway.    EDIT:  BTW Kfed has got it backwards.  In this case it's "Sum, ergo cogito."  Or is it 'Sumo'.  Hmmm.|`|IKyITYICaa	Cogito Ergo Sum.|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	There is consciousness IN it, but the universe itself isn't conscious.    It's like saying "I am conscious, but my house isn't.  The house I live in cannot think for itself."|`|2LsR22g9aa	LOL. I think they mean the universe itself. Not the incredible organisms that have been assembled out of it.|`|AA11297267	Your premise is poorly stated.    It is completely correct to say that IN the physical universe there are living beings that have consciousness -- us, and we can argue about it.    It is completely incorrect to assume that because there are physical beings IN the universe that have consciousness, that the universe itself has consciousness.  The universe is just the place where we are -- we don't define it.    The way you stated your premise would be like saying, "because there are physical beings on the earth that have consciousness, the earth itself has consicousness."  The earth doesn't have consciousness, we physical beings that happen to live on it do.    See your error?    Peace.

So loving and so kind?|`|7JIhZ0R0aa	There was never really something we could call "The Inquisition"a clear, unified, consistent Inquisition functioning throughout Europe and elsewhere down through the centuries. By definition, inquisitions were local "ecclesial investigations." Particularly in the beginning, they were investigations and trials conducted or overseen by the Church through a papal representative, the local bishop, or a member of a religious order appointed by the pope for the task. These inquisitions were rarely ongoing, and decades could go by without a given region resorting to any such trials. In England, inquisition courts waxed and waned; in the German states they were even rarer.     Inquisitions typically involved a judicial process that aimed at confession and conversion. Local bishops working with local authorities under local circumstances usually conducted the inquisitorial courts. Their goal was to secure a persons repentance for heretical views or for engaging in activities contrary to the faith. If that goal was not achieved and the person persisted in serious heresy, he would be turned over to the secular authorities.     The Church conducted the investigations and trials. Punishment was left to the hands of the secular authorities. In Protestant states after the Reformation, the state conducted the investigation and trial and imposed punishment.    An inquisition as a formal Church process was not codified until the thirteenth century. This formal institution was primarily to reserve to the Church the right to address heresy, as opposed to mob rule and the oft-incoherent secular courts that had frequently handled heresy over the previous two hundred years. It was a particular response, however, to the Albigensian Crusade of the early part of the thirteenth century that led the Church to formalize the inquisition courts.     Historyand its lessonsshould never be ignored. There can be no denying that the inquisition courts existed. As described in the papal apology of Pope John Paul II at the beginning of the New Millennium, "Men of the church, in the name of faith and morals, have sometimes used methods not in keeping with the Gospels in the solemn duty of defending truth."     The Inquisition is classic proof that the Church includes sinners who do sinful things, and that good people can make wrong decisions. It is also a classic example of what happens when those who represent the Church are caught up in the norms and ethics of the society in which they live. They can far too easily judge the Gospel with the eyes of culture, rather than the culture by the Gospel.    It has to be remembered that the Inquisition as presented in the Catholic urban legend is far from the reality of history. It is unfair to use it as a cudgel against contemporary Catholic positions, and it is pure bigotry to present it as a defining element of Catholic faith, yesterday or today.|`|yYYXVCGZaa	to instill fear of the church and kill heretics, aka people using their brains.  did you know that the word "heretic" actually means choice?
6y29MTyyaa	I'm with ?Maaadii?.  PDA would be frowned on and it would have nothing to do with you being lesbian; people don't like it when STRAIGHT people make out.  What's worse, a lot of guys have a lesbian fetish and would probably start woofing or something you kissed in public.    This should be about her, not other people, so keep it about her.  Make sure the first kiss is in private.  All the first moves should be in private, where both of you are most comfortable to go your own pace.  And go ahead and make the first move!  Heck, one of you has to do it.  If she's OK with how you feel, then what's stopping you?    You've had a rough life.  You're entitled to try to be happy.  And if you're worried there's a chance you might lose her if you make a move, I got advice for you:  The chance of losing her if you DON'T make a move is 100%.    Good luck!|`|kkFK74n4aa	There's absolutely nothing wrong with you kissing her first. She clearly wants it, but is just too afraid to initiate.

It can also pump water from a water hydrant. Fire trucks take fireman to the fires. They also transport the tools for the firemen. Different ones are used for different fires.    Trucks with ladders  Some have platforms or cages at the end of the ladder. These are used to lift the firemen to the high parts of buildings.    Trucks with hydraulic platforms     Trucks with hydraulic platforms have a mechanical arm. They have a cage or a small opening. The mechanical arm is used to raise water or firemen to high places.    Trucks with water pumps carry their own water reserve in a tank. They can also pump water from a stream or pond. They are used for country fires because there are no hydrants there.    Trucks with foam are used at airports. They pump foam to put out fuel fires from airplanes. Water does not put out fuel fires from airplanes.    Chemical trucks                          Many fires are a result of chemicals or electrical that can't be put out with water. Oil companies and other industries have special trucks to fight these fires. They use liquid chemicals and special powders to put out those fires.                               Fire boats put out fires in ports and docks. These boats pump the water from the port to the fire.                         When there is a forest fire, helicopters and airplanes are needed. These do the job of the fire truck. They spread chemicals to suffocate the flames. The ground firemen help by spraying water on the ground.

And why are they not chosen?     35 Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson     36 That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.     37 That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.     38 Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.     39 We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.     40 Hence many are called, but few are chosen.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	God wants all of His creation to be able to go to Heaven. He sent His Son to the earth to die for the redemption of the sins of the world. But He also made us with our own will to choose who we will serve. And He does not interfere with that will, because He wants us to choose for ourselves to love and trust Him, not because we are made to. He has already chosen us but not everyone will accept Him as their God. They are blinded by their own selfishness and have their eyes set on what the world has to offer them.

9Dq2176oaa	According to a second legend, one of the Buddhas disciples, a certain Bodhidharma, believed that true sainthood could be attained only by constant meditation, day and night. During one of his long vigils, sleep finally conquered him. That he might not succumb a second time to so base a human weakness, he cut off his eyelids. These fell to the ground and miraculously started to sprout. The next day a green shrub appeared. He tried the leaves and found them deliciously refreshing. Of course, it was the tea plant.      Despite similarities, Buddhist prayer is more correctly termed meditation. One form that particularly stresses self-discipline and deep meditation is Zen Buddhism. Brought to Japan in the 12th century?C.E., it is based on a Chinese form of Buddhism known as Chan, which is traced back to an Indian monk named Bodhidharma. He went to China in the sixth century?C.E. and borrowed heavily from Chinese Taoism in creating Chan. It is said that he once cut off his eyelids in a fit of anger after having fallen asleep while meditating. They fell to the ground, took root, and produced the first tea plant. This legend serves as the traditional basis for Zen monks drinking tea to keep awake while in meditation.

RvddYKqjaa	It might help if you talked to your priest or a teacher at your church. They can better tell you the requirements for confirmation. And they can answer questions about sponsors and patron saints. I bet you other kids have the same questions you do, so everyone could learn at the same time.   Your questions don't make you look like you are not devout. They make you look like you are questioning and that's a very smart thing to do.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Asking these questions shows you are taking your confirmation very seriously.  Your questions show that you are a devout Catholic.  Read The Catechism of The Catholic Church about confirmation.  Your parents should have some suggestions about an appropriate sponsor.      As for selecting a saint you especially revere and wish to be like, I recommend you read about Saint Francis of Assisi.  Your teacher should be able to recommend a good book,  or you can go to your public library and ask for a book on St. Francis or Saints in general.    The Catholic Church does not require a certain number of years of religious education to proceed with the Sacrament of Confirmation.  Your specific diocesan bishop can establish specific rules, though, so you should check on this with your priest and R.E. teacher.    Confirmation in the Catholic Church is a Sacrament that includes your willful asking for The Holy Spirit to become more active in your life.  You should approach this sacrament very seriously, just like you should approach any other sacrament seriously.   Be sure you are ready to proceed.  If you carefully examine your conscience and conclude that you are not ready, maybe you should postpone your receiving this sacrament until next year.   I'm not recommending you procrastinate, only that if you proceed now that you should be ready.    Pray about this matter, and go to Sacramental Confession regularly as you prepare for the Sacrament of Confirmation.   Accept the Mercy of Jesus Christ through the Sacrament of Confession and Reconciliation that God has given us through The Catholic Church.    I hope and pray that you will receive The Sacrament of Confirmation in good faith, and that your faith and life in The Catholic Church will grow richer as you grow older.    My prayers are with you and your classmates.  May Peace be with you.|`|KR64fnHjaa	think for yourself.  Read the bible and if it all still makes sense to you afterward then go for it.

Jesus was baptized at 30 years old and that's all that we should do.    Confirmation is a catholic "tradition" and does nothing but bind you to the church.  Jesus is our mentor and our inspiration.  We should follow his doctrine and none else.  Blessings.

DQxmUL8daa	In Chinese, characters are not used as individual sounds that come together to make words in the sense that we know.  Chinese characters on their own each have a meaning, as well as a sound.      Feng1 (first tone) on its own means wind, but when made into Feng1Su4Xi4Guan2 (means tradition.      The sounds of the characters are transliterated into the roman characters through the PinYin system so that westerners can read them without knowing the characters themselves.        becomes Hao3 because that's what it sounds like.      Similarily words from languages with roman characters can be transliterated into Chinese based on the characters that sound like the word.  For example Coffee becomes  (KaFei), a name created for a beverage previsouly unknown to the average Chinese.  Names can also be transliterated.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	Chinese language is syllabic...  that means no separate sounds for consonants...  syllables only...
Mx07dTipaa	no your not stupid. it's in your nature. you want to do what's right and you have morals to abide by. i was in a similar situation when a taxi cab pulled up and a passenger left, i got in as he got out and i found a digital nikon camera on the floor of the cab. before the driver left, i opened the door and shouted to the person that he left his camera. was i stupid for not taking the $300 digital camera? well, it didnt belong to me, so its not mine. im supposed to return it to its rightful owner. and plus, the owner would probably be pissed. so you're not stupid. just responsible.

And, if you believe in karma, then maybe that good energy will come back to you! :)|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	No, you were not. If you had kept it, then the honest thing to do would be to find the owner and return it. Sometimes the owners will offer a reward for a return. Knowing that these guys were gangbangers, you probably saved your life by throwing it back.
8bf456cc3e6af28494e91a0f89300361aa	Yes it is. For example, a sibling(brother;/sister or sister/sister ect.) argues ALOT. The reason for that is because they are so close that they dont mind sharing feelings of discontent or anger towards eachother. As opposed to two friends, one may not want to share feelings of anger or frustration with the other parnter because they do not share the same bond as a brother or sister would. Thats why you see couples arguing so much because of their comfort levels with eachother. The more comfortable the partners are, the more ideas of anger and discontent feelings are shared. If u are arguing ALOT with a close friend or relative, just lay low for a while. Pretty soon you guys will start talking again and the arguement will soon be permanately in the past. I do believe that frequent arguements is a sign of closeness. I argue with my brother everyday, sometimes i want to kill him! but i wait and wait and the anger subsides. At the end of the day i realaize that my brother is the only person i can throw punches at and call him this and would still die for him. If a couple doesnt argue at all, then one or the two must not feel comfortable with eachother because they do not share their ideas of frustration or discontent.|`|7g8UHUJgaa	i think arguing is a sign of closeness.    in relations to family, my dad and i do that all the time. lol    it is still communication none the less!    and in relations to friends. my best friend and i do too.    he and i argued about politcs. last year he said he loves me (i have not said it yet b/c we are still friends but maybe potentially more?)     anyways we argue about alot of things but if i get really mad about it, he says he is sorry and he does not want to jeopordize out friendship over it.    arguing, family or friends, is i guess sharing each others opinions.    you might dislike thier opinions and they might dislike yours but throughout it all you should both should understand you argue because you care.|`|8JjUpc7uaa	only if you're arguing about what brand of beer to buy|`|YJqw5Vtxaa	not always...i think it depends...I used to argue all the time with this idiot (a guy) and I did like him but things never got any better. It has been years, we have not been able to get to know each other much, and he does not seem to trust me much and I dont know what to think of him either.....soo to me arguing is not a sign of closeness.|`|HimBbU6caa	It's a sign of discontent and tension.|`|RvddYKqjaa	I don't think so. Arguing is what you do when you aren't mature enough to sit and talk calmly. If anything it would pull you apart very quickly. Arguing wears you down.|`|wnbz5gNzaa	It's a sign of a disfunctional relationship and/or lack of positive communication.
1SvJJFmfaa	I just learned the basics of speaking Chinese. It was practically effortless, although I didn't know a word before this. I got myself Michel Thomas mp3 files. There's smth like 10 languages to choose from. I tried at least 7 other brands, and they really didn't work for me. It's fair to say I didn't even learn a word thanks to those. Just because it was so simple, I'm now learning the basics of another language for fun    I don't think advices like "get to know some native speakers" are good or time efficient, since we're talking about learning a NEW language. Besides I've never interacted with native English speakers, yet I can write in English here and speak really well.      If you really want to learn beyond the basics, there's one method that worked well for me. I learned really good Swedish, because after knowing the basics I read a lot of novels by comparing every sentence in the novel in Swedish with the one in the novel in my native tongue. I was able to figure out which word is which, though it was slow at first. This method works for you, if you do it with a novel you are into, or are generally more interested in reading a novel than a school text book. Better pick some authors whose language isn't very complicated , such as Hemingway or Paulo Coelho. After this I moved on to audio books. And so after a half a year of reading I was able to fool a native speaker to think I'm a native as well -- judging by my writing online. But you need some oral interaction with native speakers if you want your speech to be fluent. This does not mean you have to go through the trouble of moving to a foreign country, just try find Swedish people online and use Skype (i haven't tried this yet though). (When it comes to Chinese, I'm not sure if this method works because of the different writing system. But just for the record for Chinese learners, you might want to try the "pinyinize" tool that converts the Chinese characters into Western letters and automatically adds spaces between words. The tool can be found on Pop-up Chinese.)    Also going to a country where they speak the language you want to learn, but don't speak even a little yet is not a good idea, at least if you want to feel relaxed and not consume all that much effort into it. I did it once in Spain for two months because of a job opportunity, and I didn't learn all that much, although I really tried.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	What answer do you need? The only way to learn is to study or to live and inter act with people of the place you want to know their language. the other way is try 'Rosetta Stone as advertised in television shows.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	Speak with natives, that is the best and only way to become fluent  in a language.

QOxtCMEAaa	I think the reason this idea has hardly come up, is because the act of taking the spouse's surname is mainly a heterosexual marriage process. If two men get married, there would be no different sex, so it would be almost an equal footing situation.  A homosexual marriage would simply be a marriage/union, but that's it, none of the heterosexual marriage processes or name customs apply.  That is, unless the couple would like to each combine their surnames, but that is something that would have to be looked into depending on where they live and the laws that are there.|`|pO8OzblHaa	I'm not sure.

They can:    Hyphenate    Each keep their last name    One changes to the name of the other  OR    Creat a new last name that they both take.        In my experience, most keep their last names or hyphenate.  I think this will change in time.  Right now most of the gay people getting married are older because their right to marry has only existed for five years--- all those people who would have married 5, 10, 15 years ago are getting married at once.  People who are older have lives, professions, careers, and children tied to the last name.  As gay marriage becomes a norm and a higher percentage of the gay couples getting hitched is young, that may change.|`|z0kSza6Eaa	Women change their names by convention, not law.

I just asked my partner, and he agrees.|`|SsEAvhs7aa	Well here in Canada, nobody changes their names since the end of the 70's. People here don't consider their wives to be their property anymore (because that's what it was for, the wife changed of name because she was changing of owner), so they can keep their identity. When marriage became legal for same sex couples, the law was already there for a long time, so we also can keep our identity.|`|plBN572qaa	simple answer: depends on the couple

xuuaMTmtaa	It can mean different things to different people, but usually the common theme is that these people don't experience their gender as either the way society perceives them, or in a binary way. Meaning, they often don't see themselves as JUST male or JUST female, but sometimes a bit of both, or neither.      Some genderqueer people feel as though the binary societal restrictions of "male" and "female" is too restrictive and doesn't encompass the possibilities of there being more than two genders, so sometimes genderqueer people choose the term "genderqueer" as a way of expressing their nonconformity to the gender norm.      I mean if you really think about it and break it apart, "queer" means to be unusual, odd, out of the norm, and "gender" is the way in which we as individuals define our roles in society as "masculine" or "feminine" or "male/female", so a genderqueer person would be one who experiences and defines their gender as something beyond the norm or expected.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer    It means so many things to different people.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Probably that he doesn't care to be labeled, including that one.|`|55h0RaYKaa	Genderqueer encompasses everything that involves a gender identity that differs from the accepted norms for a particular gender.|`|K35Tuf1oaa	Urge your friend to seek help

bda465ikaa	Ella,  I am not trying to be overly pedantic, but everyone alive is some kind of relative of Marie Antoinette. We are all related, we just don't know the level of our relationship. Every presidential election, the geneologists go into overtime to try and trace relationships, and everyone always acts like it's shocking that John McCain and Barack Obama are 22nd cousins, or George Bush is related to Queen Elizabeth. There is always a relationship.  -----------  Simple example that comes up often is how is Elizabeth I related to Elizabeth II. Elizabeth I has no descendants so you you back up one generation to her parents. They have no living descendants, so you back up another generation to Henry 7th. From Henry 7th you can trace 15 generations to queen Elizabeth II (via the oldest sister of Henry 8th). So Elizabeth II is the first cousin, 13 times removed from Elizabeth I. that is the closest relationship, they are also first cousin, 14 time removed via a different bloodline.  ------------  In the case of Marie Antoinette she had 12 brothers and sisters. Together they would have thousands of living relatives. They are the descendants of the Holy Roman emporer who was a Hapsburg. The descendants are mostly in Austria and Spain.  =======  Everyone of European descent is probably 40th cousin or closer. Everyone in the world may be as close as 100th cousin, but certainly no more distant than 1000th cousin.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Princess Michael of Kent, I believe is a Habsburg, as well.  Ummmm.

AA11008046	The chaplain duties are similar from one military division to another.  Only two types Catholic or Protestant.  I am current holding position as chaplain to the HQ of NATO Vets Asoc. Quite fulfilling.  there are tough times though.  Going to the home of a fallen comrade and having to break the news to your buddies parents is nothing to want to do.  It comes with a lot of grief from the parents.  However, if you pass that test you will find it very rewarding work.  The other thing I would ask you to consider is if you have studied engineering would you want to leave your profession behind?  Consider it carefully.  Of course in the services you can always re-muster and go back to engineering.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	There are more than just Catholic and Protestant chaplains, unlike that guy above me said.

When I was in officer's training school for the Air Force, we had  great chaplain.   He truly helped on a daily basis, as OTS is very stressful.      You'll need a lot more schooling in religion and also seminary if you are mainstream.  You'll start out as an officer, but some services do not require you to go through OTS.      If you really want to keep your education going towards this, look into the service helping you financially while you are in the service.  You will help a lot of men and women serving our country - and those who might be our enemies.  You get to help them too - I don't mean conversion - but letting them see how Americans can be their friends.  Good luck.  Having been in the Air Force, I have to say Air Force and Navy have the highest standards.  At least they did when I was in service.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	Just what the world doesn't need right now another delusional religious twat with access to advanced weapons.

To the unbelieving materialist, man is simply an evolutionary accident. His hopes of survival are strung on a figment of mortal imagination; his fears, loves, longings, and beliefs are but the reaction of the incidental juxtaposition of certain lifeless atoms of matter. No display of energy nor expression of trust can carry him beyond the grave. The devotional labors and inspirational genius of the best of men are doomed to be extinguished by death, the long and lonely night of eternal oblivion and soul extinction. Nameless despair is man's only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. Each day of life slowly and surely tightens the grasp of a pitiless doom which a hostile and relentless universe of matter has decreed shall be the crowning insult to everything in human desire which is beautiful, noble, lofty, and good.

We're all sinners. Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior without adding any of your own works, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16). :)|`|jW8Fm0eKaa	sounds like me.exsept i eat meat.  i highly doubt it, dont worry!|`|AA10852244	Since you are gay loving than yes.|`|WmU7jhObaa	please do a test for us. cut yourself in a throat and let us now what happens?|`|9mLOH7bpaa	Don't believe in hell, so no.|`|Dgwy3YHsaa	Yep, and you'd become human fried chicken for the next 666 gazillion, trillion, billion, million years; and Satan will find you finger-licking good.|`|lIaIDm8maa	Yes,but God can forgive all that and more|`|jwRcAOtfaa	god forgives ppl if you are like that now then you probably will in my beliefs but if you change and try to help people and maybe help an organization to prevent drug dealing then you wont go    if your mean and are doing horrible things and you died right now i believe you would|`|fAA3rjTbaa	yep i think|`|I0aosHnuaa	no  ... there is NO hell.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	I hate to say it, but heaven would look like a Vegas long shot right now.

Oh! by the way, I do not think being a vegetarian puts you in trouble (sin wise that is) with God. I believe that would be considered a falsehood.

But there is good news God sent His only begotten son to die for us so that we don't have to burn for eternity.  Jesus paid a debt that He did not owe.  I used to live for the things that you talked about but then I was never happy, maybe the moment I was doing them but I never really felt loved or whole.  Then the Lord came into my life and loved me more than anyone ever could and ever will.  He has changed me and turned my life around.

I could be wrong about all of that, way off, but God still loves homosexuals, liberals, reformed people, and even atheists (though they cannot be with him in heaven because of their rejection of Him), so if I was in your shoes, I might reconsider the possibilities of heaven instead of hell.

Origin: when adam and Eve violated what God told them not to do, which was to not eat of the forbidden fruit. This was when sin originated.     Jesus bears the penalty of sin for his people, That is why he came down and died for us, to forgive all of us of our sins, that is those that hear the word, believe, repent, and are baptized and continue with there Christian walk.|`|f6d81ae67869fe86d51ce4df292d2458aa	Sin is going against God's will in any way. Its origins are from our own selfishness and pride, thinking that we have the authority to do anything we want. Sin is meant to imply that God needs to be in control of that area that we sin in. And i know from multiple places in the Bible.   Gen 2:15-17  The first sin was when Eve gave into satan's temptation in Genesis 3. 15 The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die."   God commanded this to Adam.   Then Satan tempted Eve in Gen 3.  1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"     2 The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 3 but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.' "   She misquoted God and fell into the temptation and Adam did nothing to stop her. Then she fell:  4 "You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman. 5 "For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."     6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.   After all pride there comes a fall, and God humbles us at one point or another.   God also says that sin earns death.  Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord    Any other questions you have can be answered in the Bible. God is All-Knowing.|`|07xfGetvaa	transgression of the Law.  to lie  to go against God.  to not follow his Commandments.

To get his attention, just smile at him.     If he likes you then he likes you, but if he doesn't like you and you flirt with other guys, then he won't care.

The Jews, who come from Judah, are the tribe that maintains their identity because they keep the original Sabbath, Friday sundown to Saturday sundown.     America, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Scandanavias, Ireland France and many more wester countries compose of the other tribes of Israel.     Is it no wonder that that these nations and physical Israel (where Tel Aviv is the Capital) actually work together.  They are the same nation.     Jews are brother's to Christians.  We cannot cut off our connection with them.  Arabs are our half-brothers (the line of Ishmael).  We can't really cut off our connection with them either.     The Devil will always sow apart a family, especially the model nation that God chose to rear and set as an example for the rest of the world.      Neo-Nazis wrongly attribute their heritage to the Anglo-Saxon race.  That's not correct.      Anglo Saxons.  Saxons or Saac's sons.  Isaac's sons.  Sons of Isaac are the nation of Israel.   That's us.     Neo-Nazis/Hitler/Mussolini trace their roots aback to Aryans (Assyrians) and Romans, the very people who enslaved and massacred Jews and Israelites in ancient times.    Is it any wonder that Hitler was able to talk his entire nation into killing Jews and allied forces (all Israelite nations).  Only a man possessed with a Demon can do that.     Many Nazi generals have witnessed Hitler fall to the ground and spew strange demonic obscenities.     Palestinians (canaanites) are ancient enemies to Israel.  They always have been.      Because Israel (the lost tribes) and Judah (the Jews), have broken God's Laws, it has been prophesied that we would go into captivity once again before Christ returns to set the record straight across the world.  We have also been made to suffer.    It will get worse before it gets better, but it will get better in the end.|`|faT4MyVkaa	Some might think the Jews killed Jesus.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Ignorance.|`|iX0CoNkXaa	They can not be Christians if they hate the apple of Gods eye|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	Christians hate everyone that is not Christian, even though their bible tells them to love..they are hypocrites.|`|sgFpzgpSaa	I agree with jim the baptist!! im christian and I love everyone =}|`|QPbnFJGKaa	Because they don't fully understand that without you there wouldn't be Christians.

That being said I know many people who have incompatible charts and have been just fine and others who have not.  Love is love.  Take a chance and don't worry so much about the chart.

For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable things Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you.  You should prove yourself faultless with Jehovah your God.    Acts 18: 18 - 19    And many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly. Indeed, quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody. And they calculated together the prices of them and found them worth fifty thousand pieces of silver.  -----------------------

Like the saying the Christians have "Jesus loves you, but everyone else thinks you're an @$$ hole."|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	No, they do not view themselves as fanatics. They see themselves as normal, well adjusted, rational people, who have been called to serve God. They feel that their purpose has been revealed to them and they are going to faithfully serve.
AA11232725	Matthew 18:1  At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"  2  Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them,  3  and said, "Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.  4  Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  5  Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.  6  "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.    http://www.christianteens.net/ Christian teens    http://christiananswers.net/kids/ Christian answers kids page|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|AA11008046	I think your number one issue is to obey god and walk in His pathway. Some scriptures on obedience and the reward for same are:  Jeremiah 7:23  John 14:15,21  Acts 5:29  1 John 2:3-6  1 Kings 3:14  Psalms 143:10  Colossians 3:22-24  1 Peter 2:13-20  That should be a good starter.  There are many many more.  these scriptures will support you at 13 year old or 93 year young.

My key verse is Jude 24-25. Now unto Him who is able to keep you from falling and present you faultless before His presence with exceeding joy. It easy to find too. It's the second last verse in the second last book. I stand on His promise here that it doesn't depend on me and I'm still with Him 40 years later. No one told me about Jesus as Saviour until I was 27. A late start made it hard but He has kept me. Just claim these verses as His promise to you. It encourages me to see so many YP loving God. My other suggestion is to read the book of Job. This way you can see what your enemy is like. You can put your name in his place in the first chapters. I have worked with a group called YWAM. They have a internet site. They really encourage me.

Acts 2:21  And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'    Romans 10:9  That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.    1 Corinthians 15:2  By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you.

MSFgIuVUaa	You are getting the passage a little mixed up.  Look at 1 Peter 3:7.  It is husband that may have is prayers hindered based on his relation with his wife.    With all due respect, I have a very extensive search tool and I am also a minister.  1 Peter 3:7 is the only passage that comes close to it.|`|AM7cK4L9aa	1 Peter 3:7       7 Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	I think you might be thinking of the verse in I Peter 3:7    I Pet. 3:7  Likewise you husbands, dwell with them with understanding,  giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.    This is the only one pertaining to a couple having their   prayers hindered or unanswered.    Edit:  Oh my, I'm not the only one who has given you this verse.  It seems to be unanimous.  I always give my answer and then read what others have to say so I'm not influenced one way or another.|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	It is I Peter 3:7    MINISTER  Pray4Revival    SPIRIT  FILLED  EVANGELICAL  CHRISTIANS  UNITED    (Fundamentalist Pentecostal)|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	micros is right - here's the verse:    1Pe 3:7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.    It's kind of like this verse in Matthew:    Mat 5:23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;    Mat 5:24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

Baby chimps and baby humans are probably the closest in level when you look at age groups.|`|TEtOq1XCaa	That's just stupid. You can teach a 6 month old dog to sit, and at 6 months, a child isn't even walking. So what?    We didn't already know that different kinds of animals (and humans) develop at different rates?|`|LGBNKuxRaa	sort of figures... human babies are probably premature in chimp terms, I mean chimp babies are relatively ready to do stuff for themselves when they're born, whereas human babies aren't - their skulls haven't even set yet. also I've read that adult chimps are smarter than infants (but not toddlers).
AA11946554	Atheist literally means w/o a belief in God(s). I started off realizing that the God of the Bible can not exist (God v. Jesus even though they're supposedly the same character) and from there, I have seen nothing to believe in the other deities. (Greek, Celtic, Roman, Norse, Aztec, Incan, etc...) The argument that a person can't prove a negative would apply for me in that case (mostly b/c I don't know enough about them) but I do know that an omniscient, omnipresent, and loving and/or just deity can not exist given history and the present.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Lulz|`|HdmlZdyHaa	I think that they will say no.

We believe in God for one extremely compelling reason, It's extremely comforting to think there is some omnipotent super being who's looking out for us or who cares for us in the way we might care for a goldfish or pet.    One could just as easily ask how come adults don't believe in the Tooth Fairy, after all , conceivably there might be one.    I could hold out, but it's probably a little more effective if I learn to brush, floss and have regular dental checkup.     It's rather like that.|`|Gb1bVKBCaa	Atheism classifies us as having a lack of religious beliefs.

I personally love reading the Quran and Hadiths, every Muslim should atleast read Bukhari once. the real book and not online.    one thing that some of them say that is out of there Ignorance is "Shariah Law is Man-made" what the hell is that? your not a Muslim, Submitter beliefer in god if you believed that.

Also, what is your question?|`|atAZlwGdaa	Now pay attention to the answer!    It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast. They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah is Aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward you and relieved you. So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn. Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them not, but be at your devotions in the mosques. These are the limits imposed by Allah, so approach them not. Thus Allah expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they may ward off (evil).     There is no reference to anything being permitted or forbidden by the messenger IT WAS NOT A SIN.. In addition Allah did not follow what the messenger mandated it was the other way around. The messenger is his slave and did not ever forbid or allow anything it has always been Allah.    Try and read your words "breaking the prophet PBUH rule was a sin" That is how I would describe the one and only God. What do you think?|`|mOWyzwubaa	perhaps you didnt get my answer well my friend.  i guess the only thing which is wrong with us is that we reject man made hadith  we follow best hadith 39:23, understand it brother and follow The best.    2:183 O you who acknowledge, fasting is decreed for you as it was decreed for those before you that perhaps you may be righteous    2:187 It has been made lawful for you during the night of fasting to approach your women sexually. They are a garment for you and you are a garment for them. God knows that you used to betray yourselves so He has accepted your repentance, and forgiven you; now you may approach them and seek what God has written for you. You may eat and drink until the white thread is distinct from the black thread of dawn; then you shall complete the fast until night; and do not approach them while you are devoted in the temples. These are God's boundaries, so do not transgress them. It is thus that God makes His signs clear to the people that they may be righteous    Fasting was decreed to previous people too but sexual intercourse was forbidden,Allah Allmighty out of His Mercy made easy for us to practice deen, this prohibition was removed for us.    carefully read the Verse "Made Lawful", prior to this it WAS "NOT LAWFUL" since fasting, was also given to Prophet Ibraheem. why miss this point !!    Rules are NOT set by Prophets/Messenger, Prophets and Messengers Proclaim the message of Allah Allmighty,Proclaim the Laws and Rules of Allah Allmighty, and They Abide by it ,other than that they had NOT Authority.  we Follow the message of Allah Allmighty and we Follow messenger, but we dont follow bukhary & co.  and you propose every one to follow which is written in sunni hadith books !!!    EDIT : you asked in your previous question  the following     >>>>>>>>> "but I am not speaking of "what" happened, but about "why" it happened".      if i were you my friend i would have never asked this question NEVER ,if you insist. here is the answer.       [2:142] The fools among the people would say, "Why did they change the direction of their Qiblah?" Say, "To GOD belongs the east and the west; He guides whoever wills in a straight path."     nothing more to add after 2:142|`|vnEdfxeVaa	I don't know what is this Q got to do with Quran only Muslims ? Would you tell me exactly what is the Q .
9741a3f7ecd87afb6df1b22885eb0f22aa	Well, you can listen to straight people who more than likely do not know any gay people, or you can listen to gay people themselves.      I know I'm not going to change anybody's mind, but I am going to answer this question as honestly as I can.    As a gay man, I did not choose to be attracted to other men.  In fact, I tried for 35 years to get rid of those feelings.  Begging God to take them away from me.  It was when I stopped yelling at God, and actually listened to Him that I learned that He created me exactly the way He wanted me to be.  So now I embrace His gift of homosexuality, and use it to Praise His Name.  If I was demon possessed (as some people here in Y/A have suggested) I could not call Christ my Lord and Savior, nor Praise His Holy Name!  ALL Glory to God for giving me a rebirth through His Holy Precious Son!    Oh, and I have read the Bible.  I probably understand it better today than I did all those years I wasted begging God to take His gift away from me.      Someone quoted Romans 1.  I love those verses.  Please re-read them.  They KNEW God, yet decided to worship idols instead  For this reason God turn His back on them.  This does not describe me.  I know God, and I Praise His name.  Please re-read the Sodom story in Genesis and compare it to the Gibeah story in Judges.  The Bible says nothing (good or bad) about homosexual couples who commit themselves to each other and live monogamous lives.  Please open your hearts and minds and let God show you the truth!  He sent His Son to be the Savior for ALL.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	God does not make you gay, it is your choice.

Well, homosexuals can't bear to sleep with members of the opposite sex, just like you can't bear to sleep with the same sex.|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	No one is born gay. God is a loving God and would not do any thing that would cause a person to sin. Satan is the author of confusion not God.    I will not began to make you think that I understand why some people have this desire as I do not have a clue.     This I do know, homosexual activity is against Gods laws and therefore He can have nothing to do with it.    I also know that regardless of where the desire comes from. God loves the person and if they ignore the urge to sin and turn to God, He will accept them|`|i0OVwfcyaa	First they have to agree on whether or not to take their bible literally.    Baby steps.|`|1cGlucXyaa	I have never preached a different message. God loves homosexuals, God did not make them homosexuals. He loves the person, but not the way they choose to live their lives.

Or do they choose to be without legs? And if so, is being without legs a sin, or is moving around in a wheelchair the sin? After all, travelling about on wheels is not how god intended us to act.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	This Christian does not know if desire for gay sex is innate or learned.      However, this Christian thinks God does not want gays choose to  perform gay sex.|`|MSFgIuVUaa	Sorry that I answered your second question first.   I think the passage that I mentioned in James 1:12-16 works very well.  I believe it is a choice and not something that someone is born with.  If someone is born "gay" then that would either not be a sin, or God cannot blame the individual for his or her actions.   James says that God cannot tempt anyone, this would mean that no one is "born gay" or with gay tendencies.   We are tempted though in the things that we desire.  Any sin is not an overnight change, but a development over time.   The desires that we are tempted in are formed over time.   Temptation is not a sin though.  Someone can be tempted to have a homosexual lust or to act.   It is still up to the person as to what to do or think based upon that temptation.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	I think Gorillawitz makes a good point that alot of people are missing.  The thing that differentiates straight people from gay people is not whether or not one can love - they both do love, and Gorilla never said that they don't.  The difference is who you have sex with.    God says for us to love men and to love women.  We can express our love by buying gifts, sending flowers, cleaning their car, painting their house, paying for their kid's college, etc.  According to God, sex is reserved as an expression of love to be directed ONLY to you wife (if you're a man), and ONLY to your husband (if you're a woman).    Sin is simply doing something OTHER than what God said to do.  Sexually, that includes having sex with anyone other than your spouse (of the opposite sex).|`|M6VcuiyDaa	Both answers are just excuses to be hateful.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Having Gay sex has nothing to do with Love. Its about the sexual plaesure of screwing somone of the same sex.    So your question should be why did God allow someone to have feeling of want to have sex with the same sex?      Just because God me a man and my body desires to be with a woman is not a reason to go out and sin.|`|01b75bbcd20c3e82e1a4500548e5dd11aa	Nothing binds a group of people together like having something to hate. Helps keep that false moral superiority thing the Christians got going for them,    Hate comes from ignorance, which breeds fear.     And the most disingenuous and patronizing thing to say to someone you've just deemed unequal and beneath you - love the sinner, hate the sin. How cruel, how unchrist like! Right there, hate for your fellow man for no other reason than the way they were born, that's the abomination.|`|f6d81ae67869fe86d51ce4df292d2458aa	Sodom and Gomorrah was burned to ashes because of their homosexual sins (Genesis 19). God would not resist anyone because of the way He created them.   God loves us all. So do not let anyone tell you He hates gays. John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten son, so that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.  He created man, and He thought that the man needed a helper, so He created a women out of the man. (Gen 2)   Not to be inappropriate but think of why genitals fit well together.  Man is for women, and vise versa. No person is born gay. Don't believe anyone who tells you they are. But don't hate gays or let anyone bash on them, we all sin and that's just something that God needs to deliver them from.|`|VR3xtDGoaa	PAY ATTENTION TO THIS:   Romans 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.  24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. 25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.  26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.  28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; 32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.    1CORINTHIANS :he one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH. 17 But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him. 18 Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body|`|22dbbca70f3b06f8ab4be8dd2695fd31aa	G-d took their mind away from them, so thats when they start to do stupid things in life including sleeping with the same sex.

Valentines day this year falls on Saturday so Friday night take her to your house, just spend the night with her, talk, rent a couple movies from netflix (watching movies at home gives you a better chance to talk or cuddle or whatever), eat chinese take out etc... the point is it doesn't have to be fancy.  Just like any other date night but make it last a bit longer and concentrate more on her.     Take a walk through the woods in the snow on Sat. (Don't forget to wear a parka and mittens, COLD, haha) & talk. Girls love to talk.   Go to a cafe get lunch, something WARM. Get her a small gift, since she said she didn't like the cliche-ness of it all.  But make it sentimental.  Is her heritage important to her.  You could get her something that relates to that (lets say shes italian, get her Venetian earings).  Does she have a hobby, get her something to help her pursue that (ex. photography, get her the new photoshop), etc, etc, etc.    Just concentrate on her and let her know you love her, thats all it is.|`|159e14ec854d24444172426d492de79eaa	well: you know February 14th is "Valentine's Day and it's very important thing  with Society & Culture says we should celebrate  that together as Friends "
0UbWIuAMaa	Those are all fine...I assume for female vampires.  They are less serious than the names I focus on when drafting vampire characters.  What I will often do for vampiric names is to dredge up archaic and odd names from the victorian era.  They seem to suit vampiric natures well.  Names like Elizabeth, Venetia, Evelyn, Isobel, Jacqueline, Katrina, Anne.  Or for the males how about Gabriel, Caleb, Marcus, Antonius, Malachi, Constantine.      Another suggestion would be to look up biblical names or old european names in general.  It always seems that the strong vampire names are old-fashioned, perhaps because immortality and long life are associated with vampires and so the older names give them a sense of age.    More modern, girlie names give your characters a sense of youth and adolescence.  That is fine, if that is what you are going for.      In my opinion the names also seem to convey a bit of a "trying to fit in with the trend" nature to the character.  Knowing nothing about your story I picture characters with those names as young teenage girls without much wisdom or maturity to them...very teene-bopperish.  Again that is fine if that is how you want your characters to come off.  But if you are looking for something a bit more strong or deep Id look for names that are stronger or deeper.      I know that people say its just a name, but in truth a name conveys alot about the character.|`|TEyzimuYaa	Yes.|`|gSjjYctKaa	this whole vamp thing is stupid. it's progressed over the years from goth to emo to vamp to whatever the kids and Hot Topic does next.|`|GaBsQacmaa	I like Valerie

The connotations of "justice" assume that wrong will be done; that "justice" will be needed to maintain a society of fairness and balance.    Maybe we should aspire to not needing justice or other deterrents to live in a civil society.    When people accept that society is about "we" instead of "me"; that everyone has something to contribute and share - then maybe we can move forward as a unified race of beings. We can advance much further working together, realizing that no-one needs to take, if we live in a society where people give.    As long as selfishness continues, and the human spirit is corrupted by lust, power and greed; then there will continue to be a need for justice.    Up with respect, recognition & equality - Down with the need for justice, distrust & damnation!

I've known oodles of people who were able to use the assistance to pull themselves out of that dark place you're in.  It doesn't mean you need to take them forever, just long enough to give yourself a chance to work through some things.  You have absolutely NO reason to feel guilty for being Bi.  It's simply part of who you are, like your eye or hair color.  Part of your issues of perhaps clinging to people a bit too enthusiastically may stem from watching your parents relationship, and with the issues of abandonment that can stem from having a parent with a substance abuse problem.  It's hard to trust anyone in any kind of relationship when you've had that trust broken before.  I would really think about talking to a professional who can help you work through those trust issues.  As for the not having a relationship until this point in you life issue, don't worry about that.  You have enough on your plate that you need to work on for yourself before you can even begin to think about adding another person to your list, you know what I mean?  Work on you, the rest will follow.  Good luck, and remember you're not alone.  A lot of us have been there.|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	take the med's honey. they will do you a world of good|`|1UAuRQtfaa	get the help sweetie and it will be okay. open up to someone dont push people away if anything a friend is what you need. good luck stay strong!!|`|7wqIJbPjaa	clingy isn't that bad, i'd rather clingy than whore that doesn't love me lol. :]     advice: don't reminisce about your past. forget it, it doesn't sound too cheery, i'm sorry love, try to focus on the future and work your hardest to be optimistic. try to make some new friends, or just get out more in general. :]     oh and why not take the anti-depressants for a trial run? if you don't like them you can just not take them, its not an obligation. :]|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	go with the antidepressants or atleast therapy.|`|ltYtxmjEaa	wow... its like looking into a mirror.. you are just like me... excuding the parents being all messed up bit. but i know what you mean. i don't know how to deal with that kind of stuff.... so i just surpress it. :) the only advice i can give is watch some movies tonight and eat food. and if your looking for some kind of inspiration.... look up the songs incomplete, precious illusions, and so unsexy... would not come... i dunno... its all by alanis morissette.. she always helps me out when im feeling down or confused... so check her out. she has definitly changed me life.|`|8Pbevy7laa	Well I do suffer from anxiety and depression and I'm bi so maybe I can help, when we grow up we learn from our parents behaviour, so it sounds like you have not had a lot of real love or good examples to emulate. Remember you are not your parents, you will copy a lot of their mannerisms/behaviour but if you learn to recognise the destructive patterns like driving away your rescuer then you can try to change and or fix it. First you need to learn to love yourself sounds like a cliche but hey it works. Find all the things about yourself which you think are good or the things that you want for yourself and celebrate them, give yourself a chance take some emotional risks. And with the clingy thing I had the same problem, it stems from a fear of losing things which you love. You need to take control of yourself and force yourself to stop needing your other half all the time. Learn to be happy by yourself and then you can share it with another person male or female. Sounds like your life is falling apart but if you concentrate on positive things for yourself then you can put it back together again. As long as you're willing to give yourself a chance there is nothing that can't be beaten.|`|k2CwVuqqaa	I know people probably tell you this all the time, but it will get better. My life is horrible right now. I've had to deal with my mother going through a stage of depression, my aunt doing drugs, two people in my family trying to commit suicide. I'm not in a relationship either- I've had one boyfriend...when I was three. Do NOT concentrate on the bad parts of your life. Think of how blessed you are to have gotten this far and be thankful for the stuff you do have. Try doing an activity you like to get your mind off of everything else. I can't remember who said this, but: "regret for wasted time is more wasted time" You'll get through this. It may not happen soon, but something good will happen.|`|n0w7gISyaa	Hey.  I feel sorry for you-who wouldn't? Just cheer up. You just havent't found the right guy and he hasn't found you yet. But one day you will meet and be happy : )|`|k4fd4jnjaa	You are a person and we all want to be loved, but you have to love yourself first. Sounds corny, but once you put yourself in that place everything falls in place. You are who you are.  Who you choose to love is your choice. You don't need drugs. You need a wake up call. hop in the sadle and take the reins!!! Your parents will never understand you because things are not really working for them. Don't you dare give in and crawl into a hole. Get up enjoy the sunshine and smell the roses. Someday you will find another clingy version of you and you will understand each other, but you gotta fix you first!! Best of luck and you do matter. Every smile you can give a stranger might just have made their day-and yours|`|plBN572qaa	simple answer to complex problem: you're thinking about relationships too much, which is making you sad...make friends and listen to songs like get the party started by pink and unwritten by natasha bedingfield  these will boost up your self esteem ;)

21Lnhdfeaa	It doesn't matter if he saw his shadow or not.  It's either 6 weeks or a month and a half.  And that's the exact same thing.  Winter always ends on the vernal equinox, which is circa March 21st; 6 weeks from today.|`|7k5xrWq3aa	Yep he saw his shadow.  Which means six more weeks of winter, sadly. So bundle up!  Although, since Phil started his groundhog career, in like the 1950's...he's only been right 39% of the time. So we may have hope.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	yes he saw his shadow and bite the handler too|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	depends where you live, there are groundhogs all over the place, and they dont all agree. lol  my nearest psychic groundhog (lol) is "Wiarton Willy" and I think he did see his shadow today...|`|IJZZkDUvaa	Yes, the groundhog saw his shadow in Pennsylvania.    The reason that we have this myth is the following: the groundhog lives in Pennsylvania, which was founded by mostly German immigrants. This is a German folk-tale.    It has some basis in truth, like most folk-tales in that in Germany, if it is a sunny day in the Winter, that means that you have a High pressure system overhead, which gives sunny and cool weather. This would be the groundhog seeing his shadow.    In Germany, if it is cloudy, then it would be rainy and cold - a temperature pattern associated with Low pressure system and weather changes - which is what you get when the seasons are changing from wintry weather to spring weather. This would be the groundhog NOT seeing his shadow.    Spring officially happens on or near March 21st on our calendars and it is called the Spring Equinox because the day and night are both exactly 12 hours long.    According to the myth, since the groundhog saw his shadow, we are in for more cold weather  - and if you look at a weather map of the US, much of the Eastern US is still under the grips of the ice storm from last week!  London England had record snows today!    While some people may say its all just superstition, you can see that in some ways, this weather myth is useful!
6TuyXuJRaa	Anabaptists baptized after adulthood and they believed hell wasn't forever. Among other differences|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Anabaptists are a denomination of Protestant.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	In a fight I'm pretty sure Catholicism wud win|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Anabaptists are Christians of the 'Radical' Reformation. Various groups at various times have been called Anabaptist, but the term is most commonly used to refer to the Anabaptists of 16th century Europe. Today the descendants of the 16th century European movements (particularly the Amish, Hutterites, Mennonites, Church of the Brethren, Brethren in Christ, and other respective German Baptist variants) are the most common bodies referred to as Anabaptist.    Believer's baptism is one of the defining characteristics of Anabaptist beliefs, but was considered heresy by the other major religious groups of the reformation period. As a result, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th.    The above is from the wikipedia article. I'm not sure why the reformation of this/these group(s) are called radical, but they represent some of the earliest to break away from the dominance of Catholicism. They even make the claim that theirs is a religion of apostolic succession, the same claim made by Catholics. This, of course, is refuted by many. See the wikipedia article for more information and a good place to start researching this early religious movement.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	.What did the Anabaptists believe in? In general they believed in:   Adult baptism (learned repentance)     Mass to be a memorial service for the baptized       Pacifism; Anabaptists refused to do military service     Secular laws and oaths were not recognized         However, the Anabaptists had no generally accepted doctrine as each group adopted their own specific beliefs and there was no central organization.    The Roman Catholic Church recognizes the Magisterium, the Doctrines fo the Roman Catholic Church, Tradition, and Dogmas of the Church. We do recognize secular laws. Catholics do military service. Catholics recognize infant baptism as a valid baptism (if done in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). There are other differences, these are just some basic ones.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Anabaptists:  Bible alone  Baptism of adults only  Saints cannot pray for us  Only 2 sacraments  Truth of God decided by democratic vote  No separation of church and state.

6eGZGEw4aa	This is what I'm doing for my boyfriend. It's original, creative, and not too expensive:    Make a homemade card that simply says OUT OF ALL THE FISH IN THE SEA, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE FOR ME!     Buy a fish (I am buying a beta because it's the most beautiful) with a simple round fishbowl (of course I am going to make the bowl look nice).    Now the next part is up to you...you can draw out a bunch of paper fishes, all different colors, and surprise him by hanging them from his bedroom ceiling. OR you can buy him a bag of goldfish crackers and give them as the 'pre-present' then surprise him with the card, and the actual fish as a surprise, OR I also thought of buying a bunch of swedish fish gummies cause my guy doesn't like the crackers.    Get as creative as you can...your guy will really like it. :)|`|oxWpo4bqaa	offer to make or bring dessert.

And now I'm afraid to come out at my new school, but I and you will learn how to deal with gay haters. and if you need a new friend I am always here.|`|H1DrMEZxaa	I'm pretty much in the same situation as you.  I don't know if you would like the easy answer or the hard answer, so here are both:    EASY ANSWER    Tell them you are gay, smile, and the world will be fine.    HARD ANSWER    Here is how it went for me.  I sat them down.  Looked them in the eye.  Told them that I had something really important to tell them and I didn't want them to talk until I was completely finished.  I then told them that I am gay, but I was still the exact same person I was 10 seconds before I told them.  Except now I wasn't keeping a huge secret.  Then I started to cry my eyes out.  Results may vary according to friend.|`|vNEjL0xXaa	If he really is one of your best friends chances are that he already suspects. You can start out by telling him that you have something that you want to tell him but dont know how he will take it. Tell him you value his friend ship and dont want him to make a big deal out of it but that your gay and just wanted him to know. if you dont make a big deal out of it there is a good chance he wont eather.

That said, you have to remember that not all people will take the news that you are gay well. My own father tried to kill me when he found out that I was gay. I had 12 broken bones and didnt get out of hospital for weeks. I'm saying this to let you know that you have to protect yourself. You must learn who to tell and who not to tell.

UIhbK2xOaa	I'm not sure what kind of hat you mean by beanie. In Canada that would be a boyscout's cap or one with a propellor on top, but I'm going to assume you mean a toque. The general rule of thumb is that men's hats and unisex, functional hats when worn by women should be removed at the dinner table, in church, and during the singing of national anthems. Therefore a functional, outdoor toque worn by a woman should be removed, but a cute one that is part of the indoor outfit need not be. In any case the hat removal rule does not apply to all indoor situations like band practice, at least not in North America.|`|AA12225585	I vote that all hats for men come off.  All pretty hats for women can stay on but women only really wear nice hats to church anyway or to red hat society get togethers.  I say remove beanies and caps and hats unless you want to face the wrath of me!|`|zRPXczxAaa	I, a man, seldom wear a hat, but when I do, I wear it indoors and out, and never, ever take it off for anybody or anything.  I tell people who seem to take an interest in my hat to mind their own business.  There is no longer any such thing as "proper etiquette regarding hats."|`|rThIVk2maa	Men's style of hats, which includes baseball caps and beanies and any other style of men's hat, are to be removed indoors. It's just a respect thing. Women who are wearing such hats should obey that etiquette as well.     The tradition that women didn't remove thier hats while men did originated because back then, women's hairdressing included pinning the hat to the hairdo, so removing it would be inappropriate, like taking your hair down. I know it sounds silly, but that's how it works :)|`|KBVAbwUXaa	you can wear a beanie if your going through kemo therapy|`|e2926326f61b2becbde04426fcb444c8aa	Any type of hat used by a man should be removed while indoors.  The rules for women are not so easily stated.|`|zlwyUWikaa	beanie's as in yamakas?(sp) i believe they are worn both inside and out,  and if you mean like winter beanies, not the religious kind, then i'd take them off indoors.|`|d965e2dc138cf0b2dd651db63f42c311aa	A winter beanie should be taken off and any other hat that is not a religious hat should be taken off when you are inside but seems society has really gotten relaxed when it comes to these things.|`|a66nvk0taa	Women can wear hats in church etc. but men have to remove his hat when entering a church etc. Plus good manners to remove one's have when going inside someone house etc
1TYZDRUqaa	Makes sense to IJR.  Good old DNA, he died much too young.  So much left to say.  But he did die in a fitting way, trying to stay healthy running on a treadmill at a gym.

True in the complete statement, but not true that just seeing the beauty is the end of experiencing a garden or learning from it.    Edit:  Gardener??? I wonder about the cells and molecules.  I wonder about the webs of life that exist in the garden.  On the other hand the universe is not a "garden" it is pure nature and has not been shaped by any intelligent hand.    (And seriously, anytime I walk through any garden or park, I could care less who designed or maintained it.)|`|CBynwmKwaa	yes and no|`|U51pBeLfaa	I think the little gay gardeners should be thanked and appreciated for their efforts. Disbelieving them seems insulting and discriminatory. I can just imagine one of them saying, "Nobody believes in me. I don't care if I am not appreciated. Working all day in the sun with a pain in all my joints  down my left side."|`|iyLDTvsTaa	No it's not. I went to my local community garden. It's kind of like a park with trails where you can view all the beautiful flowers and plants. At the bottom of the hill, there were 2 guys getting it on in the foliage. See, there ARE fairies at the bottom--at least at the bottom of mine there is.|`|TLLklriUaa	LOL- I'm listening to Hitchhiker's Guide on my I-Pod right now.

8Pbevy7laa	If you really love him then you will accept his decision as a free individual to come out of the closet, trying to get him in a relationship might just add confusion that he doesn't need. Be respectful of his right to be gay and move on. You really have to realise he is gay, which means he cannot be in a relationship with you, I'm sorry but its the way it is.|`|x7uRjwseaa	I am sorry hon, but its unrequited love. Its best to move on now. =/|`|aaa3523f0b9d11f8a74170b04af40919aa	I have a girlfriend of mine who slept with a gay friend (male) when she knew he was gay, and he knew he was gay they even had some sort of relationship. Believe me you don't want to go down this road, feelings will get hurt you will get confuse. I know it's hard to get over someone, i suggest you acknowledge that it will never happen, then ask yourself why you would want to be in a relationship with someone that doesn't share the same deep feelings as you. You will get over it; you just have to work at it find yourself some other activities that makes you feel good, different scenes just to get away for a while.|`|Mvfqsyupaa	Can you say "FAG HAG"?|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Then you must be attracted to unavailable men. Did you not have a good relationship w/ your Dad? That's a classic sign.

Try and find a more available love interest :-)|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I know it's not easy. I'm gay, and when I was in college, I fell in love with a straight guy.

That acceptance alone is a large part of the battle.|`|KSq8DXlfaa	Instead of aiming to be bf/gf, what if you just tried to become friends with him?

Just try to be friends and see what comes from it.:)              If you know that for whatever reason you won't be able to befriend him, i know you don't like this answer but try to move on. If you need a "conclusion" to your crush, get up some guts and tell him you like him but know he doesn't feel the same way. Then move on. Find another guy (who's straight!) who you think is cute and try to focus attention on him. It may take a while, but you'll get over him in time. Maybe get a hobby to keep yourself occupied/happy in the meantime.     Whatever you choose to do, good luck!:)|`|vL8JErXNaa	And this great love is going to lead to what???

The truth is, you're not going to "change" this person.    I'm not saying this in a calloused way.

L0R92wWeaa	Well, It really depends on your heart. When talking to God, he wants all of you- and to be focused on him. That doesn't mean you have to talk like " O god, In heaven, thou art great". I'm not saying that's BAD, but just talk to him like you would anybody. A lot of people pray in there own heads. It's like reading a book. Every time your reading a book- do you read out loud? No. It's the same effect. But if your just walking through your day and thinking " God is going to support me" rather than asking god to support you, why would he here your prayers? So silently, out loud, w/e, just make sure your focused on God- and your sincere about what your praying about.    And I'm not sure what you mean by NLV. NLV is a version of the bible called " new living translation" just like you have "new international version" or "new king james version" but the acronym for old testmant would simply be OT and new would simply be NT.|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	air can't hear your prayers|`|6jAVElX7aa	Jesus our Lord and Saviour said not to do like the hypocrites and pharisees who go about the market place making long prayers, in order to be seen by men, but to go into your room and your heavenly Father who sees in secret,will reward you. So yes I think Christ hears prayers as Paul also mentions be in an out of prayer constantly.     I am not so happy about the NLV try NIV and the initials for the old testament are O.T
kQSkA2c6aa	I know exactly what you mean, I think there's a lot to be said for Buddhism's focus on the individual doing the right thing rather than on following a set of strict 'do this' and 'don't do that' rules on which no-one even in the same 'religion' (e.g. Sunni/Shi'ite or Catholic/Protestant) can agree.    There are 5 basic 'precepts' but like the 10 commandments these aren't really anything people of any faith (or none at all) wouldn't agree with to at least some extent.    not to take the life of anything living,   not to take anything not freely given,   to abstain from sexual misconduct and overindulgence,   to refrain from untrue speech, and   to avoid intoxication, (i.e. losing mindfulness)    Personally I narrow it down to 'don't do anything you wouldn't want someone to do to you' ... that's it... no preists or preachers... just that... I reckon if I stick to that one, I can take my chances whatever faith or philsophy (if any) is 'right'.    It seems you're looking for your own path as well... I really hope you find whatever works for you whether in teh company of others or just for yourself.  Good luck (and kharma) to you.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Half the people here don't really know what Buddhism stands for. And half the people here haven't even read their holy book, if there is one :D.

After all, the ultimate aim is self-enlightenment and realizing the ultimate truth -- a goal that can only be attained by following the noble path which stresses on ethical values, concentration, and wisdom.|`|PJmpTnlKaa	No Islam's not stuck up. Islam can be a very peaceful religion, depending on who you've been influenced by.    Personally, I've never been one to believe in Gods, Christ, Allah or Buddhas. Yet Buddhism, as a philosophy in life, makes the most sense to me.    To put it as simple as possible, Buddhism isn't about worshipping Buddha but more of adopting his practices. It's about finding yourself, doing the right things and abstaining from the vices.    Some other religions insist you believe in their god otherwise you go to hell (despite constantly claiming how much their god loves you...). The most wonderful thing about Buddhism is that it doesn't matter whether you believe in Buddha or not, as long as you live by its values and philosophy.
