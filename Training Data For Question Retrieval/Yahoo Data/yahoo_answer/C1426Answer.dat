6GmtcZteaa	You are born crazy you do not develop it ! ( and all my cries and hopes and wishes goes out to those of us who were sadly less fortunate than us )..Being lonely only makes you anti-social, if you stay lonely for a long period of time, it might even let you forget how to treat people, suddenly youre all that aggressive against everyone, brcause youre not used to listenning to someone or lettin them give you advice, the only voice youd be listening to well be your own. also you might start being paranoid about people in general like they want something from you, or are following you to mock your or something, it degrades your confidence social skills and self esteem, i wouldnt recomend anyone stay alone for more than a week. that would be just horrible. go out and have fun. people are fun. alot of things are fun, and its free, so go over there and socialise. tc|`|43eUq8hOaa	no,but it definitely sounds like you need to get out and make some friends.What's stopping you?|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Watch Castaway.    I live in a garage.  I don't go out for months sometimes.  Sometimes I go out once a week.    I am crazy.  But I think I would be crazy in the constant company of fellow humans as well.    You can become depressed.  It modifies your social behavior usually.  It will not however make you crazy.|`|8a79654618ecf04aeb281ca8a0b6b067aa	ya.. constant loneliness make a man crazy.. they think some crazy work. like sex with next door aunty, like sex with prostitute, reading sex stories, like this our mind go crazy..... may be u also may go this.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	yes, it seems that's the summary of the works of edmund Freud.|`|nQOaKiueaa	I agree with "broken veteran", watch castaway.  Sometimes you need someone to talk to, but all the time makes some people crazy as well.  So I guess craziness goes both ways.|`|0nVwF6JEaa	yes that person would go crazy because humans need to be in contact with other humans.
vAdtlZDpaa	To see a horse in your dream symbolizes strength, power, endurance, virility and sexual prowess. It also represents a strong, physical energy, a need to tame the wild forces. The dream may imply "horsing around". To see a herd of wild horses in your dream, signifies a sense of freedom and lack of responsibilities/duties. Perhaps it may also indicate your uncontrolled emotions. Smiling in a dream represents feeling content and happy in life.    Your comments about admiring the horses when you were younger, then beginning to fear them indicates that you were able to give free reign to your emotions when you were younger, but as you got older expressing your feelings about thing became more difficult for you, perhaps you fear the consequences if you were to express yourself more openly.      To see flies in your dream symbolizes filth and dirtiness. It indicates feelings of guilt or a breakdown of a plan. Flies may also forewarn of a contagious sickness. Alternatively, the fly could represent an irritating and annoying person in your life. Perhaps someone does not know who to mind their business. To dream that you are coughing represents your fear or dissatisfaction of the future. You need to put some distance between yourself and others.  Alternatively, it indicates that you have made a negative choice in some important matter.     It sounds like something happened recently to you that "left a bad taste in your mouth".|`|l3UVuGetaa	I think this is about how you feel you always give everything you can to people and situations, but time after time, you always feel like you are the loser.  You don't have a problem with speaking your mind as such,, but never really get to the heart of the problem, you will pick at things that annoy you, but never actually deal with the real source of the problem. You probably fear making a fuss, or upsetting someone enough to leave, but it leaves you feeling resentful.
1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	You're obviously trolling here so I'm not going to rise to the bait, but no equality is key. Beauty can be seen anywhere one chooses to; refinement is a personal characteristic; spirituality is a belief and emotional diversification is simply a statement that women feel a range of emotion, which incidentally men do too; just because they are capable of not being slaves to their emotions it does not mean they don't have any (If you mean women have emotions a man does not please elaborate as I'd love to hear this). The stuff you have listed here are qualities to be found in people from either sex.  Women are generally more empathic to others emotions, however I think this has more to do with social conditioning than gender. As a man I can recognise when someone is upset, angry etc. The difference is it's O.K for a woman to offer up support whereas there is always the suspiscion that a man 'wants something else' (or at least that's what goes round in your head) - this is often wh a man will not approach a lost child or offer first aid to a strangers kid (in the back of his head he sees a mum runing over and battering him with her handbag and a playground full of parents that will be thinking he's a child molestor) women don't have to worry about that.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	"Don't you think that women are really more superior ?"    Without a doubt, YES !    Case closed.    Good night and sweet dreams !|`|AA11307468	Of course, if you base superiority on specific traits which are more common in one gender over another, that gender would appear superior.  But does that really make that gender superior, or is the viewpoint flawed?  I personally like to see people as a whole, and while men and women are different, we compliment each other.  Because of this, there is no superior or inferior gender.  We are all equal.|`|0w5Apf1naa	I realize your a troll, but I would say many feminists here would agree with you.|`|d7rOO1Zwaa	If you are a man, yes, women are "more superior".    If you are a woman, you are a bad example for women's superiority.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	Is that what you think?|`|2bO7iiZdaa	No.|`|NJMGZ6TRaa	yep.|`|xh5EuJlbaa	Femitroll?

It's funny how some of these guys come back at you with their little "insults" and yet they obviously don't realize that they're talking about their own mother, sister, daughter etc.  It really shows that some of these guys don't think with the head on their shoulders often enough.  Anyone who feels they are or must be superior in order for them to be happy are never truly going to be happy...  all they're going to think about is how they can make themselves feel superior to the opposite gender in order for them to feel better.|`|wIoym87Yaa	I don't think women are superior.

However, I keep wondering why if they are so much better women are still attracted to us average knuckle-dragging, retarded male goons that can't make any of the decisions?

d7VxASN6aa	Don't focus 1-2 people so much, instead try to look at the big picture, that even if you lost those friends there are so many more out in the world. Remember a true friend is somebody who can stick with you through the good and the bad, and true friends are extremely hard to find, do not expect to find any more than a couple of these in your life. But that is still no reason to get out there and experience people and just live life. The best way i can tell you to stay on track is if your personal life is failing you, switch to your student/business life, get things done so you can feel more secure about your own future. And don't forget to take a you-day, where you take a day off alone and start get stuff done, like running or meditating, or even simple errands.  You'll slowly find your mind drawn away from your own worries, and that will surface more in your personal life. A care-free attitude is guaranteed to draw people to you, as well as drastically boost your confidence in yourself.  Personally i find that no matter how bad things are going, i think about "what is going on right now in my life, or this moment, that is positive, or can be looked at as a learning experience". At first you wont see a clear answer, but time works wonders, and you'll be thinking positive in no time.    Oh and just to leaving you with something to think about..    Remember to keep balance in your life, as in everything that you do.|`|6GmtcZteaa	You need to wake up to whats usefull in this life   Friends?

You can't depend on anybody else to make you happy; you have to make yourself happy.  You may be all alone for now, but isn't it better to be alone than be in a screwed up friendship?  You think just because people seem to have friends, maybe lots of them, that they're happy deep inside?  And what if something bad happens to you and you need a real friend to be there for you?  Many people are false friends and will abandon you the moment life gets really tough.  Plan and dream for your future, get involved with making it happen, develop your interests and passions, and watch yourself bloom.  You'll have others envious of your position in life, then, so you'll still have to watch out for phony people, because they are everywhere.  And one final word, do concentrate on your studies, throw yourself into them, and lessen the time for feeling sorry for yourself.  You'll get past it, if you're willing to try.|`|NxwSdiBGaa	same thing happened with me 3 years back  one of my friend come back to me...but she is changed totally  That time that filling was so bad, than loosing her...

Women are made to become warm and expressive because they function to take care of the offspring.

When we go to sleep at night, we dream, correct? We see pictures of things, but yet, our lids are shut. I could be mistaken, but I believe I heard somewhere that blind people, IF they had sight at one time and lost it (as opposed to being born blind) could still dream with pictures, though it they were really young when they went blind, this may not occur. Yet, still, let's say you go blind at 18. Apparently you still can have dream with images, although your eyes can't see even with your lids open, and now they are closed. So mind can perceive some things on its own.    But you want to know how we can see wat heaven looks like when we have never seen it, so our mind does not know what to create? Some may say heaven is what you want it to be. Others, who think heaven is a specific way might think (and I said might) of it in an almost psychic way. That we perceive the image just as people allege to get psychic impressions of places they have never seen.    Just some examples and thoughts.

Once we all realize we're all human beings, racial sensitivity no longer becomes a problem.|`|g8EfleRXaa	Racial sensitivity training would need to convey that the color of one's skin does not signify superiority or inferiority.  Perhaps a segment of the training would include having to spend time with people of different races.  In this way, one would gain facts about others, which might lessen the tendency of viewing them through stereotypes.  Consequently, it might be easier to display sensitivity once someone is more aware of another's norms.|`|rZSCtEf8aa	Colorblindness - I think it would be fascinating to present a panel of varied opinions to a class wearing blinders.

4su2AwvCaa	No offense but people like you make me sick    I have my reasons for being diagnosed with something serious and still having to hear people complaining in my ear about things so petty.    You should be thankful for what you  got  maybe you havent reached that mental maturity yet but complaining makes anyone sounds spoilt and maybe thats why you complain?    but put yourself in others positions or wait for an event to happen to you which will hopefully open your eyes from ur petty world you are now surrounded with|`|dDcX1NNOaa	It takes a conscious effort. It takes realizing how your thoughts happen in your head and forcing them to stop. It's not easy and I recommend starting small. A cpl times a days try to notice that you are thinking about the negative sides of any given event or situation or a person and force yourself to balance those negative ideas (which all may be true) with positive ideas which are also true.    When you can think of both negative and positive ideas on whatever you may be discussing then you will have the choice of complaining or complimenting.|`|ih8PG93Laa	I have the same problem, so before I say anything, because eI don't recognize when I am about to complain I try to run my thoughts through a little strainer in my head and take out all of the negative things. I still, very often, complain. I'm sure that I will ever stop, but when I think about it, I want to because I know that it could be alot worse. :-O|`|AA10458195	Try to put yourself in the other person's place. How would you feel if  you had to listen to someone that is a constant complainer?  Also if you consider the sick people in constant pain who are dying of  terrible diseases, do you really have anything to complain about?  Try to be thankful for what you have and look on the bright side of life.

That said, doesn't mean that she can't rekindle those feelings for you.      She says that she could never feel that way for you...does she consider you to be a really good friend? kind of like a big brother?   she may enjoy your company and she may really care about you, just not in the way you hope for.    I'd say ask her to dinner, spend some time together. Do things you both enjoy and take it from there. I would definately not push it on her. You may end up losing her as a friend also    Good luck :)|`|NJMGZ6TRaa	get back and chase her like crazy.

OutT1EbTaa	It sounds as if you are experiencing adrenaline withdrawals.  Within a week or two, you had to write 3 essays and take an exam.  So you were in constant "Go" mode for a significant period of time.  Now, your body is looking for that same level of stimulation.    You can usually work off the anxiety by going to the gym, going for a run, playing a friendly sport with a few friends, etc.  The physical activity will give your body that quick fix it needs so you'll be able to relax a little better and enjoy the last few days of your vacation.|`|4Ef8yCbfaa	It happens to all of us unfortunatly.

Well, the only way is to keep your mind away from this anxious feeling by engaging in activities you enjoy. Hope this helps! :)|`|nQOaKiueaa	You should start being an outgoing guy. You don't have to go to the malls or any crowded place, you could simply enjoy the park or fresh air. Maybe the beach? Go walk near the beach and play with the water.

When did this happen? is it only now? or have you experienced it sometime in your life other than this?    is the anxiety possibly coming from worrying about the examination?    is it sudden?    also, try to avoid too much caffeine. It may contribute further to the palpitations.    try to go out with friends for a while.    hope this helps.
nQOaKiueaa	Yeah I do.  It's just a lot of studying to do and when you finally get to work that's the time you get to buy everything you want and finally live your life.

ngxw9waWaa	I have yet to come across charismatic spanking, or abuse. Children can become volatile and require discipline. The parent who fails in their duty to admonish their child is then exposed to a society who will exact that task with far greater emotional injury to both.    Necessity for inflicting violence upon a child is a failure in good parenting skills. Charisma begins at home, and they who cannot win by love and guile their own children can hardly be considered charismatic or anything other than pretentious prigs. Raising a child in an order environment and reasoning when the child misbehaves is the norm. If matters have become dysfunctional as to require physical violence then the parent has failed and deserves the child it has reared. Children are our creations, and exhibit, sometimes to our dismay qualities and faults we may have. An intelligent parent creates sensible moral children, ineffectual parenting by hypocritical and disagreeable misanthropes creates angry children with behavioural disorders.    Violence should be the very last resort and occurs in times when the parent is distracted and disinclined to expend time reasoning with what may be construed as attention seeking matters of vanity than need. Hence the great and urgent need for family support networks in communities for stressed parents and unruly children in a time of social upheaval.
fofzdoROaa	I think that this question is important and that the answer has bearing on how we individually respond to others. The degree of emotion that we feel is not the same as what we share, due to a number of factors which are related to the social relationship between us and the other person involved.     Thus to continue with you example, if we are leaving a close friend or relative, the level of expressed emotion is likely to be higher than if we leaving for the same journey from say a business partner (who is not a special friend).     The degree expressed also depends on the nature of the person who has the chance to express emotion. If we have been brought up not to express emotion, it may be that even when saying goodbye to people whom we feel to be close to, we cannot and do not show our feelings here.     These differences are due to our up-bringing and to a degree to our genes. But circumstances also play a part. Celebrities in particular are expected to show emotion in public whilst political leaders are not. This is regardless of the amount of emotional nature of the personality involved when being expressed in a more private situation.|`|hpdZDBVQaa	I think some people just are made that way. My mother was not overly emotional in public. But I think in private, she would cry and let go. She didn't emote automatically when things happened. She was kinda of reclusive when it came to showing sympathy to others. That's just how she was.    EDIT: When I was younger growing up until possibly finishing undergrad it bothered me. But as I aged, I understood. I think it was a coping mechanism. She internalized alot but was a strong woman.
tjygjPmtaa	yes, it is possible that you have Generalized Anxiety Disorder but it's too early to tell, unless you see a doctor.    Some people suffer from panic disorder, some phobias (agoraphobia:fear of open space, which can explain why you fear people) and all other things but all of that is treatable    You're not alone.    I can sense that it's causing you distress and some dysfunctions in your life, you should see a doctor or talk to a friend or family member.    medication is the last thing to consider since antidepressants such as zoloft and paxil are addictive, they also have side-effects.  you can consider    cognitive-behavioral treatment: google or yahoo it.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	First thing you have to do its get a appointment with a doctor ; you need some good medication if you want your life back ; and do it today|`|bry9Tk3Maa	go goth, or emo, or if you really want to try, stop acting so teen|`|9jr5QaE5aa	dont underestimate a bar bt i wld say just visit one there u wil find someone to dicuss it with who knows u mite run into a doctor for free     i think u have self esteem issues and u want people to feel sorry for u i mean look at your picture    just get out of that shell babe coz ul miss out on a lot of things     do u have a bf?    r u hot ?    coz if u r hot it wnt take u long to find a job
fDGPbwdsaa	Feminism teaches women to behave this way... if someone says "women are better than men at xyz" it is acceptable, but if someone says "men are better at abc than women" it is unacceptable.    Larry Summers discovered this, to the detriment of his career. He and some feminists with fragile ego's were in meeting and he suggested that "maybe" men were more inclined towards math & science than women - one of these 'strong independant women' apparently felt physically sick and another nearly fainted... such strength.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Women have better verbal skills in general.

But they probably get it from the fact that women mature earlier then men both mentally and physically. Women start maturing mentally around 16-18 years old but guys mature anywhere from 18-21. WOmen also go through puberty and growth spurts sooner then men.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Cus they are fabulous and because they can ;)    Gurliegurlie girl gurlgurlgurl gurliegurliegurlie GIIIIIIIIIIRRRLL !!!|`|qVmIokXPaa	It's fantasy ; chill..

But, seriously I don't know why some women think that.    I also don't see how women mature quicker than men as someone put it.   Just take a look at any spring break commercial and you'll see 20 something year old men and women acting like brain dead morons.  They seem about equal to me.    In my experience most people don't mature emotionally till they're in their 30s.   Very few mature in their 20, and fewer yet in the teens.   And some continue acting like brain dead idiots till they die of old age.    I don't see it as anything to do with gender, just that as a whole the human race is becoming far less intelligent.  There are some Intelligent individuals left but, for the most part they are few and far between.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Judging from my time spent on Answers, people in general are vastly more dumb than I ever previously thought, and men are certainly no exception. The men that think telling a woman she's "pretty" will get them a sexual harassment complaint, the ones that think that "the law" states that if a woman has one drink, she cannot legally consent, the ones that think that ONE person's comment is indicative of the mindset of an entire group, the one's that think that women having the right to abortion somehow translates to men having no "reproductive rights" at all, the one's that think that just because a couple of the women they know behave in a certain way, that ALL women must behave this way, the ones who think that having a penis confers perfunctory superiority, (etc, etc) are certainly not doing their gender any favors in proving how "intellectually superior" men are.    EDIT @ Know It All-To be sure, it's better to err on the side of caution, but I was really referring to men who think that they can actually GET IN TROUBLE for calling a woman pretty, i.e. that that LEGALLY constitutes as sexual harassment. It does not. BTW, I think the women who think a man calling them pretty constitutes as sexual harassment are just as dumb, if not DUMBER, than the men that believe it. Nor can one "complain" for another. That IS dumb. Man, stupid people irk me.|`|ftbIWNydaa	They aren't.|`|C53stbyFaa	The same reason Men think that they are smarter than Women|`|qM1qoDhCaa	I don't. It seems men and women tend to have an aptitude for different things. Like women tend to do better in English and History whereas men tend to do better in Math and Science.|`|djuw8cfQaa	idk|`|dDcX1NNOaa	Women and men are groups of people with too wide a range of characteristics to answer this question. Individual men and women however can be intelligent and dumb, as you've probably noticed.|`|1qPgXNdHaa	How some women probably think:  Because there are more men that are into sports, cars, and that sort of stuff than women.  The majority of these guys are less intellectual than people that aren't as interested in that stuff.  Intellectual people are smarter.  Therefore, generally, women are smarter than men.    I don't agree with that argument completely, by the way.  There are a lot of other factors not taken into consideration.    Some studies also say that women have a 1 IQ point advantage over men in the US.|`|tK1yoGTkaa	Uh..because they are?  Geez, haven't you got the memo?  All of the worlds problems today are because of men.  Any good in this world today are because of women. Because we men have kept women down for ages we are in this warlike, economic quagmire we're in today!    It's a wonder why they marry us and have let us lead for so long. But never fear; they are rising to the top and all will be better, smarter, more peaceful. sigh.|`|AXNowGPyaa	They are.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Many women say it merely because MEN have been going around since the dawn of time claiming to be superior in every way.  It's only natural for women to defend themselves. Both sexes have their own strengths and powers, and there are some women who have greater mental and physical strength than some of the men.  Strengths are on a case-by-case basis, not a general one between the sexes. I've met women who excel in math while some men can't do division.  I have seen some men with better writing skills than some women.  You can go round for round forever but neither is superior.  Some women are smarter than men.  Some men are stronger than some women.  It's not across the board.  It is on an individual level.  I don't think either sex is superior.  Any man or woman who thinks so is ignorant, sexist and egotistical.|`|71mE0r7kaa	It depends on each individual person not one gender.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I agree with Miss.Motley. There you go girl !!!!    Wendy G : 'The men that think telling a woman she's "pretty" will get them a sexual harassment complaint' -  I was in HR, and know of reports from women employees for this same reason. Some reports from certain women were like "this guy called my friend 'pretty' and she feels uncomfortable to report, so I am reporting". I understand you're referring to the paranoia, but it is always better to err on the side of caution. No two women are alike. Just saying.|`|AA11307468	I can only speak for myself, not all womankind.  I think I'm smarter than some men and some women.  But I'm not as smart as some men and some women.  No one gender is smarter than the other.  Whomever you are, male or female, there is always someone out there smarter than you.

Jz3T68b6aa	Try this out. Imagine a work without money? It is possible, but we grew up in a world where money is involved with everything we do and not many people are game enough to try this out.    But to answer the question, who would be in charge of how money is to be split between the countries? Not to mention the possibility of corruption where larger countries get more than others. Also this could cause countries to goto war.     Besides the gov't shouldn't have to bail out companies. If they go down, they should stay down. Otherwise lessons wont be learnt.     But the reason the economy is in the can right now is cause of this thing called interest rates. Interest rates is theoretically non-existent money so every time you are paying off your interest, you are just paying off money that never existed in the first place and therefore increasing a gap that will ultimately increase the debt that the country is already in.

fofzdoROaa	Thats the second time you asked this question!|`|m89kGXBnaa	Perception:  a single unified awareness derived from sensory processes while a stimulus is present.    Attention: a concentration of the mind on a single object or thought, esp. one preferentially selected from a complex, with a view to limiting or clarifying receptivity by narrowing the range of stimuli.    So, basically, perception is the process by which we can gain information about anything in the outside world, and attention is the processes by which we select what to gain information about, what information to let through the filter, in effect.    Perception is the process by which we make sense of stimuli present in the world, or the information we are recieving from the world. Attention is the selection of stimuli of thoughts to continue/concentrate on (i.e. on which to expend the brains processing power). You need to percieve to pay attention, and attention is necessary for perception, but they are different processes. Attention is mediated by the frontal or prefrontal cortex, perception by the perceptual areas (i.e. vision cortex at the back of the brain, temporal lobes, sensory strip, etc)

The waitressing is also a good choice, however, as you said, people have less money these days.  If the actual basic pay, forgetting about tips, is lower than the clerical position, go for the clerical.  Tips are never guaranteed so you will be more secure in your clerical role.      Also, with office experience, you will find it easier to move on into other permanant positions with a greater chance of higher earnings.

I am not in favour of violent or capital punishment, I believe that is the animal instincts in us coming out and we cannot run a good society as vigilantes. We merely become as bad ourselves - if you kill someone who could otherwise be prevented from harming others (i.e. life imprisonment) then you are a killer yourself, you've just justified it. The only true reason to kill would be prevention of harm, when there are no other options.    If it happened to someone I knew, I would probably voice a different view, but this would come from emotional attachment, the need for revenge.

Are many teens ,like you, who were the "hood`s hero " and now at this age they became very shy  This is caused by your hormones, don`t worry, remember : you always turn back to the kid you was ( if you want it of course)  This happened to me too, at 12 years, I didn`t know where to put myself to not disturb the environment, cause I felt like I act like I`m not totally a balanced minded men  This things come and go with the age, the best we can do is to help the younger people to understand that everybody went through this  I suggest you only too do every day what you want,seriously, maybe you think that you can do something to change things, but only the time can do this because of your hormones  For now, just relax, don`t think much about the future, cause you could get in a really bad mood  Don`t get angry, and don`t take things so seriously  In fact, the life passes anyway, so still you are in this state of mind, just try to do things that you like, search a hobby, feel good with your life !

AA12360662	Well, you had a dream of guilt conscience.<br>  <br>  Normally, when you dream of death or anything related to court, you more or less have a dream of guilty feeling.<br>  <br>  facing death penalty = guilt conscience<br>  at your parents house = need protection, trust<br>  <br>  <br>  In your case, it is more than guilt conscience, you also have insecurity in you.  That is related to your fiance.   Somehow you are seeking for trust from others.  That may be from your family.  Projecting in parent house could mean that is only source you may find comfort and trust from.   Regardless what kind of crime you had in your dream, being found guilty is not a good sign.  It symbolize anxiety, insecurity.  More or less, it is about relationship.

Suggest to urself every night as u fall asleep "I will remember my dreams." If u wake during the night write down the main symbols and the entire dream will usually come back to u in the morning. Practice keen observation in your dreams through self-suggestion prior to sleep. If you are unable to decipher an important dream, suggest to yourself, before your next sleep, that the dream repeat itself more clearly. Be practical in your interpretations. Always look first for a lesson. What have you refused to face or been ignoring? Dreams are the reaction of the inner self to daytime activity and often show the way out of the dilemma. So relate them to current activity, because dreams may be retrospective as well as prospective. Dreams come to guide and help, not to amuse. They direct your attention to errors of omission and commission and offer encouragement for right endeavors. They also give us the opportunity to pray for others and to help them bear their burdens. Look for past-life experiences in your dreams. These manifest themselves not only in color, but in the proper costume and setting of their period. They come to warn you against repeating the same old mistakes; to explain your relationship and reactions to certain people and places; to reduce your confusions; to enable you to better understand life. Dreams are primarily about self. Only a few dreams relate to family, friends, and world events. Remember, persistence is necessary to learn any new language, and dream symbols are the forgotten language of the subconscious.<br>  <a href="http://www.near-death.com/experiences/cayce14.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.near-death.com/experiences/ca...</a><br>  Now to try to help interpret using Edgar Cayce's advice...<br>  Court-martial/court trial criticism (from others or Self) (195-42, A-1).

A lot of people I have talked to said they would find it harder to cope without friends than family, and I agree.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	Having friends is good for a number of reasons, but don't mistake them for loved ones like family.  Friends are allies, and people you enjoy spending time with, but they should put their own interests first -- just as you should put yours first.  You may develop a platonic love for friends over time, but don't think that as soon as you become friends, they're devoted to you.|`|0BJWUl5raa	Of course , having a friend is always a good thing.

When I was at my lowest point dealing with depression, it was a few close friends who made sure I got help, who checked up on me multiple times a day to make sure I wasn't going to do something stupid, and who stayed on the phone with me till 2 in the morning. If it wasn't for my friends, who knows where I would be today?    After that experience, I was able to sort out who my real friends were and the "bad" ones.|`|eA9U4kDEaa	I don't know honestly. I guess it's subjective to each person. I actually really value friendship. Thing is though - I expect too much from people. Im an overly over-sensitive person. I give alot from myself. But as i've grown older, I've come to realise that people don't really give me back that same appreciation. When i was younger, I enjoyed having 'good' friends. Since high school though - I've been mostly by myself. Just alone. People are just way too self-involved too invest time in maintaining a decent friendship. I only really trust myself now. I don't want any friends now. Because I want too much, and I know from what i've seen, that i'll just end up getting hurt. As cynical as that sounds, I believ it bo be true. So be thankful for the few good friends you may have.

WwXrTQgaaa	Most people in a 'position of power' are there due to their narcissistic tendancies. Narcissism usually is accompanied by other such undesirable dysfunctions.    Generally speaking, most people in 'positions of power' are dellusional and not capable of actually making sound judgement decisions.  Therefore, most of their actions cannot be explained successfully.
JI7NQ9TNaa	When consumers wean themselves from the habit of instant gratification, that might actually work.    Our economy is very different from the Post War economy of the last century. Its near impossible to "buy American", because we lost our manufacturing base decades ago to become a "service economy". That looked neat on paper, til companies started out sourcing jobs.    The thing is, in a sluggish economy, you can't eat a "service". You can't sell if everyone is cutting back.     But we got used to being gouged by businesses, in particular Banks in the last two decades.     I believe that we should all start being just as mulish about "fees" as they are.    Do you have a cell phone?  How much of your bill is use, versus fees and extra charges?    But it takes a willingness to say "No".  And do without the service until the companies become more consumer compatible. Until then...nothing will change.|`|lCwmfNuraa	You want to stimulate the economy? Give us all of the stim. money and everything else will fall into place.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	Well, I think you're absolutely right in starting to think we are at the breaking point. It is going to come a time - soon - when people are just simply going to not consume the same goods and services they consumed before. And that is when the businesses are going to understand that this is it.    You can't expect the president or the congress to deal with economic problems via legislation. That is just not how it works in a country like the US. Also, it is not efficient because of political differences, lobbying, PR, etc. If the government were to order rents to be at a certain level, do you think that law would pass? Think about what the arguments for and against it would be. What if you were a landlord?    Airline fees will only be dropped if demand slows down enough to force the airlines to do it. Prices are quick to go up in times when costs go up (like the price of fuel a little while back) but they hardly ever come down when the costs go back to normal levels. The only thing we can do is to stop flying with any company that charges the fees, until they drop it. Same thing with everything else... Sadly, most of us will have to keep buying overpriced items simply because there is no alternative. It feels wrong, but that is how a market-driven economy works.
TCB2C8NPaa	In depression research and literature, this is essentially always raised as a limiting factor.  Women are 2-3x more likely to be DIAGNOSED as having Major Depressive Disorder, but there seems to be no difference for dysthymia with the qualifier that people are in fact reporting it when they experience it.  Researchers are not blind to the notion that they people may not report symptoms.  We don't assume that men experience it half as often as women: they simply state that women report it.  Unfortunately, this comes across in non-academic literature as women experiencing it more often.    It is unlikely that men experience depression as often as women for the simple fact that women experience depression specific to their sex: postpartum.  However, researchers will always acknowledge that there are limitations to any research, and material on depression is no exception.  It doesn't make the statistics useless, they just need to be cited properly rather than misinterpreted to mean something that could not possibly be deduced from the data set.|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	Because men make them depressed !|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Some chick at the CDC just made that up so women's programs could get twice the funding.|`|84gK4XlHaa	I can't speak for how they would know that women are 2x more likely to be clinically depressed, as that seems like a hard thing to really survey.  But you can reason that the suicide rate in men is 4x higher because they choose more lethal methods.  Whereas people don't always seek help for depression, most serious suicide attempts do get reported and it's a fact that women actually attempt suicide more often.  They just tend to gravitate towards less effective means such as a medication overdose while men are more likely to hang or shoot themselves.  Therefore, if more women are actually attempting suicide than the only reason that men would commit it more often would have to be principally because they chose a more effective means.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	Statistics show that 90% of statistics aren't accurate|`|WkLJI40baa	Every social science study has the same flaw. They try to make fact from emotion. It can not be done.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	There are quick pencil and paper questionnaires that can give you an idea of whether someone is depressed or not.  (Eg. the Beck depression inventory)  Hypothetically, if I wanted to take a reasonable guess at the demographics of depressed people, I would try to obtain a study sample that is representative of the population (in terms of sex, race, age, religion...whatever)  and give them all the questionnaire.      There are drawbacks to self-report methods like this.  People may try to choose what they think are the most socially acceptable answers instead of the honest answers.  The scale by itself isn't really adequate to diagnose depression.  But you're right - people from some demographics may respond differently to depression than others.  So looking at who considers themselves depressed, who kills themselves, and who gets help, while interesting, may not tell you who's depressed.    I wouldn't be half surprised if somebody has already done the kind of study I'm talking about.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	It depends on how the data was collected, obviously. You would need to know that, to know the answer.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	I agree with you.  I think the rates are similar except that women seek help and get the treatment, whereas men don't.   Simply the difference is diagnosis.   The CDC only knows what is reported on the CMS 1500 form and UB92 form.   (Those are the complicated forms with all the little codes when you see the doctor).        I don't know if that is part of the macho attitude "I'm a man, I should be able solve my own problems".  I hate to see our men suffering like this.  I think it is the cause of increased drug addiction and alcoholism in men as well- they know something is wrong and they self medicate.|`|ftbIWNydaa	Great question.

Conspiracy!" LOL|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Agree with oleowl_2000 above. Men occupy both the ends of the spectrum - the dumbest zone and the smartest zone.

'Women are as good in combat, they're as good of firefighters, as interested in politics- hell, perhaps even as good at basketball and tennis!'     The reality is that I simply don't trust feminists. They've cried wolf too many times and have exhausted the trust of the average rational man. I wouldn't trust their offer for water if I were dying of thirst.

I've met too many morons of both sexes to entertain the thought that either one is mentally better than the other.    As I understand it, there is a belief in equal worth.

Some say no, while others say that men are indeed smarter than women. I was cruising the internet to try to find a source for an answer to your question and found links to a British study that claimed that men are the smarter ones. Many other links disputed this. Go ahead and put "human intelligence" in a google search and you will find lots of links to people that have opinions about this. One might ask if studies concerning this question are biased by ideology of the people conducting the studies or interpreting the results. It's always possible to twist statistics to conform to your specific agenda, whatever that may be. Below is a link that provides an answer by Marilyn vos Savant, .who has an IQ of approximately 230.     Really, why does it matter? There is a wide range in human intelligence.  Even if it were true that as a whole men are smarter than women, there would still be individual women who are smarter than individual men. And there are many measures of intelligence, ranging from problem solving to good old common sense. Edit: Even if all men were smarter than all women, that doesn't automatically mean that all women are stupid. Some people interpret this is the implication of this type of question, which makes some people defensive. No one likes to have their intelligence questioned, especially when the implied reason is arbitrary.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Neither gender is physically or intellectually superior. There are lots of women who are physically and/or more intelligent than men are.  Both sexes can be stronger or weaker than the other.  It is all on an individual basis.  It is not a generalization about either gender. Not all men are strong or intelligent and the same can be said of women.   Anyone who defends their gender as superior in any way is simply an ignorant, sexist fool with an ego problem.  That goes for any man or woman who believes they are superior.   Information like this is concealed in BOOKS.  Now you've been made aware - happy reading.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	No......men and women aren't different or the same. because you can't group peo0ple just by their sex. There will be 50 women stronger than you and 50 weaker than you. It would be like saying chairs are prettier than tables.|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	Well this question is a bit difficult to answer since all people are physically and mentally different to one another. But your point that being physically different and mentally equal are mutually exclusive is not 100% accurate in my opinion. Physical differences is an overall thing, whilst mental differences are only to do with the mind. Its like saying if two people are wearing different outfits they can't be wearing the same jumper - just not true. For example if two people had one body part that was identical to one another, but others that are different they overall they are physically different but certain specific physical aspects of them are identical.   Furthermore different and equal are not opposites of each other - things can be equal but different. Perhaps you should rephrase your question to why do people say they are physically different but mentally the same - because things can not be both different and the same.     Sorry, I am just slightly pedantic and I spotted a loophole in your question!|`|HekCbLHsaa	The professor is smarter than YOU thats for sure.

vAdtlZDpaa	Recurring dreams are significant and mean that your subconscious is trying to get you to pay attention to something that you are ignoring in your waking life. You will keep having the dreams until you get the message.    To dream that you have committed a murder indicates that you are putting an end to an old habit and your former ways of thinking. This could also mean an end to an addiction.      To dream that you are running away from the murderer indicates that in your waking life you are not facing an issue, but rather trying to run away from it.      Dreams of murder occur frequently during periods of depression.     I think the symbolism of trying to "conceal the body" and "lying" in your dream indicate that you are hiding something from yourself and/or lying to yourself in your waking life about whatever it is that has ended for  you.     Also, to see someone crying in your dream indicates that you have repressed or not acknowledged feelings of sadness, and so they feelings have no outlet except while you are dreaming.|`|YJGEEJhWaa	Recurring dreams are significant and mean that your subconscious is trying to get you to pay attention to something that you are ignoring in your waking life.

A situation in your life now is bringing up the same sort of emotion and so it is time to face the initial situation and let it go otherwise these feelings  will keep cropping up in more and more situations throughout your life. To face it doesn't mean it was ok, it just means you are not letting it affect your life any longer, it will then lose its power over you

CvBJ3RKPaa	Everybody hires lobbyists.  If you live in a large town, they probably have a lobbyist for the state govt, if not the federal government.  If you work for a large company, they probably have one.  Industries as a whole always have lobbyists, etc.  Their functions are to dispense information to pols, as well as to persuade them.  If a senator needs statistics on say, nuclear power, he may get that information from a lobbyist for that industry instead of having a staff member spend their limited time researching it.  Same with Goldman-Sachs.

I am sure that you do want something for yourself, or you would not have bothered to compose and send the question.

This is because of a lot of selfish or narcissistic trends. Don't hate yourself for them, simply think about how to change.    The answer is to stop thinking only about helping yourself and to turn your life around by concentrating on helping others, be they family, friends or poor or lonely people in the street.

BfmV2KpUaa	The movie-makers ultimate goal is to create an illusion that makes us forget we're watching a movie. It's about taking people somewhere else not normally within our experience, whether you're transporting them to magical lands or immersing them in a complex plot.   Of course we all know that the people are just actors, special effects are created by computers, and there are dozens if not hundreds of crew members just out of shot behind the camera, but if the movie works, then for a while, even if just momentarily, we allow ourselves to forget we're sitting in a movie theatre. That's the magic of cinema.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Builds expectations|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	There are two main effects with me: amazement, in some of these "special effects;" and, more often than not, disappointment that the film's budget went to the technology instead of the writing. A perfect example is this remake of "The Day the Earth Stood Still." It had some amazing effects, but it was otherwise a slow, plodding movie. I would have enjoyed seeing Reeves' character speak to the UN, and a bit more of a conversation between him and John Cleese.

As for knowledge, that may help us to decide what to do or to say, but there is no necessity for our knowledge to find use in this taking of choice. And if we try to put some sort of order into which of these three levels comes out bottom, then its obviously the brain because within it are both knowledge and wisdom, probably going upward in status in that order.

Although I can imagine the disappointment a lady must feel when she has gotten herself revved up for a first time encounter with a new partner only to discover that his tool is not large enough to be useful, but I still think it is overly cruel for her to implement such a savage punishment in retaliation.

AFqZEOlRaa	It's not a matter of choice, really, short of putting up a great wall of China around your country, cutting off all communication with the outside world, and owning only what can be produced in your own country.  Every country on the planet is globalized already.  Some are more globalized either because they produce more goods that the rest of the world wants or because they buy more of what the rest of the world makes.  Each country maintains their own government, although they are all affected by policy decisions that affect their ability to buy and sell in the others.  But if you are talking about a one world government, the only people who want that are not at all concerned about any disparity among the riffraff.
dDcX1NNOaa	If your worry was truly about her and nothing else then you don't believe she is truly over it or you can't believe it. And if that's true, then it's because she has given you a sign that she's pretending or you're not over it and you're pretending.     If you need answers you may want to confront the person who did this to you as a child. If you need resolution you may want to contact police. Before you do either of those things I recommend having a talk with your friend and discussing with her what you are feeling, if you feel close enough to her.|`|Ctdg2paYaa	One: you need time to adjust to the news, take the time.    Second: it didn't turn like you may expected, she's ok, yay! but she forgave her father :(, and I can see how you feel about it, but she is good, well adjusted and happy. Remember, he also abused you, she's not the only victim, you are a victim too.    Third: God Bless You, you are a caring soul, you have a heart, but please don't you ever sacrifice yourself in such manner,you'll end up hurting yourself. One day someone is going to use your kindness, understanding, compassionate, and loving nature to take advantage of you, all the good, wonderful qualities you have, will be used to cause harm to you and others. Why? Because predatory individuals seek people like you and mistake those wonderful qualities for a weak spot to exploit. Protect yourself.     Think about it, silence didn't help you, it helped that molester, his daughter forgave him, but you need closure for what he did to you. Keep in mind that molesters never stop, other little girls are in danger, is ok that your friend forgave her father, but did he pay for what he did? He sexually abused her and you. Did you think you were the only victims, ask her if he went to some sort of therapy, is he aware he is a pedophile? Did he stop? If not other little girls are in danger, you owe it to them.     And no, not everything is ok, a pedophile is free to molest other little girls, not ok at all.|`|89d25df90098a3a917f7a0232401b354aa	Although you are happy for her, maybe your heart is disappointed that you protected her for such a long time from her dad and now she has forgiven him....your heart feels that if this was going to be the situation in the future then you should never have protected her in the first place....

Or for that matter whatever your feelings are, like you mentioned in your last line that you feel bad for not protecting her.|`|8hvVvzIJaa	i think you may be feeling bad for not protecting YOURSELF. you are a caring person but that needs to start with YOU...God Bless|`|5BKHud3baa	Sounds like you have placed all your bad  feelings onto yourself.

I think anytime someone feels as though they couldn't protect someone in a bad situation some of the guilt stays with you if you believe there is more you could have done.  However, I'm not sure if that is what the root of what you're feeling is from.      This goes so much deeper than you protecting her, its also about all the years of how you felt about everything that happened to her & YOU.  You didn't deserve that & who was there to protect you? Her way of handling it was forgiving him but in your eyes does he deserve that forgiveness for what he did?  Doubtful & that seems like maybe that's what you are having a hard time coming to grips with.  He suffered no consequences for what he did & maybe after you left you thought eventually his daughter would be the one to fight back & he'd get what he deserved.          My advice would definitely be to talk with a professional, you should never have to feel the way you're feeling or have gone through what you did.  But also, just one last question - did your father ever know what this man did to you?
joiacDUdaa	We're spending a lot more for things we buy everyday.. If you notice in the grocery store the packages are getting smaller but, the prices are the same or higher.  I've always been a coupon user but, now even more so than ever.  I also use money-saving rebates and if I'm NOT happy with a product I will call the 1-800  and see what they can do.  In most cases I get my money-back or some coupons for other products.  I save about $100,00-$200.00 per month just using coupons and rebates...         I used to buy dept. store make-up-  I was in Walgreens a few months back and they had in the money-saver FREE mail-in-rebates for Maybeline and some other brands of make-up so I thought I would give them a try.... I also use coupons AND Walgreens gives back an extra 10% when you put it on a Walgreens gift card online.  The make-up was excellent and FREE- actually I made about $2-$3 extra $$$$ since I used the coupons as well +10%.  Now I go there monthy and see what's FREE !  I get shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, bodywash, asprin.. Lots of different things.  PLUS- with the Walgreens giftcard I used it recently to get ink-jet refills, for the computer for color/blk and wht. it was about $20 for BOTH !      We also stopped going to the reg. supermarkets and shop at discount markets like Marc's, Aldi's and Save-a-Lot for items we use everyday.

We're also NOT going on vacation this year as we don't have the extra money to fund the expense.  This past Christmas we opted to draw names to keep the costs down.

HpWujntlaa	Everybody's done it or something like it. The female form is a beautiful thing and as a young person just being exposed to it for the first time, drawing it was probably your way of coming to terms with it. As a child, we are exposed to all sorts of new things all at once that we need to make sense of somehow. It's perfectly normal. In fact, artistic expression isn't solely a way that children deal with sexuality. Many things. A young man I know who is 18 now used to draw the world trade center all the time after 9/11. You've got nothing to worry about.|`|atJxwFssaa	Maybe it means that attraction to the opposite sex can start at a very young age.

6dQT8uM3aa	First af all you have that girlfriend because you feel there is no other option, just like you have your father or your mother. she is not the cause of your feeling blue, you hate her because she is not supporting you and because she has a lot of what you don't like about yourself.   Reach out and volunteer, when you do something for others you feel good and you see your self worthiness. When you are depressed you want the world to fix you but nothing suits you, when you volunteer  you muster the energy you need to help and that alone will energize you. There is a lot of knowledge nowadays to self improve, to self actualize, to grow, and to realize that we only have this life to accomplish what we came here to do. Think of it like this If you had been selected to compete at American Idol and you have a shot to win, would you waste it or would you come out of yourself to prove not only to others but to yourself you are worth it, well Life is that reality show you are in you have time and you have you so go for it.

I don't know what the song means, but I like that line and I have my own definition for it.       It's probably winter where you are; that usually brings all of us "down" a bit.

Pride for being a good daughter.  Pride for being a great family member.  Pride for being a hard worker.  Pride for not being ugly.    You have to work on your self-esteem. That way you can realize that you are capable of walking out of that chicks life and start building a better one on your own. THEN and only then, will you be able to know what type of relationship you want and be happy.  Happiness comes from within. No one can give it to you.

They go on accumulating wealth for themselves and their children and grand children and so on depriving the basic amenities of many poor people.    If all the riches and upper middle class just restrict themselves  to maximum of 2 own houses and reasonable bank balance to provide good education for their wards and their medical needs, the world will have a very decent economy always.    The job should be offered only for either of the couple so instead of one family , two families can have a decent life..

Any such success will be tied directly to stabilizing the economy and then expanding it responsibly through policies that support a blueprint for future economic growth which will include critical infrastructure spending, various educational initiatives, a massive rationalization of the tax code and tax enforcement, rational reform of public entitlement spending, universal healthcare, and a long term plan to pay down national debt.    Tailoring policies to enable the economy to produce more and more rich people in short periods of time is a recipe for disaster. Rich people should emerge by dint of their hard work and intelligent risk taking. The field does not and should not be tilted in their favor. The rich should emerge the old fashioned way because they earned their wealth fairly and squarely, or because they inherited it, or because they married into it.    I disagree that the metric you propose would be an accurate indicator of the success or failure of Obama's  presidency.|`|DXXpHKupaa	That can go both ways.    If more rich people are created-it can be said that the gap between middle and upper class has grown even more.    If less rich people are created, then it can be said that the economy is to blame.    You can't win in politics, there is always another story and point of view.  Anything can be twisted.

(An important stage of treatment is self recognition.)     Bipolar disease is a very strange thing and its frequency of occurrence in different people can vary from being a few minutes up to several months.     It is regarded today as a serious problem about which psychiatrists have developed a number of treatments and medicines. So it is my recommendation that you consult with a psychotherapist and try to understand more about your problem and hopefully about its cure.|`|4Z5T98pKaa	you must experience mania or hypomania (lesser mania).

TbTO5SXlaa	Are you trying to say that you and I can better decide how to spend our money than our "Dear Leader" and his Socialist Democrat followers? Always remember its OUR MONEY. We work for it and then the government takes it away from us. Now you're silly enough to want it back?    Its all about control. Control. The Socialist Democrats want to control the money and you and me. If they relinquish control of the money then how will they reward their loyal subjects at the local, state and federal level? How will they direct you and me to spend our money the way they think it should be spent?     Thinking about buying a new vehicle? An SUV perhaps? No, no, no. Bad choice. You'll have to pay an extra tax for your gas guzzling, greenhouse gases emitting foolishness. Thinking about a hybrid? Good consumer. Good, good, consumer. Here's a tax rebate for being so wise.    Never mind the fact that you have 4 kids and need the seating of the SUV. Our "Dear Leader" and his Socialist Democrat toadies know what's best for you. Why they may decide to levy a tax on families with more than 4 members. Of course they're too smart to call it a "tax" - it will be a drastic reduction of the tax credit for more than four family members.    The fastest and best way to stimulate the economy is by a reduction in the individual income tax rates. Of course this isn't likely to happen for the aforementioned reasons. I've often thought that if the politicians who constantly babble about "helping the working poor" were really serious they'd propose a suspension of the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, currently a combined 7.65%, on the first $12,500.00 of earned income. That would put $956.25 back into the worker's pocket. This is as likely to happen as pigs sprouting wings and flying.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	IDK.  But, the amount is estimated at $27,000, plus, for each worker, or, $6,700 per person.    I think a tax holiday would be the answer, but, that would prevent all the pork in the bill by our "concerned", (LOL),  congress.  WTF, Acorn will get about 4 million or more.  That surely will create jobs, (like hell).  It will go for bonuses or some crap.    Imagine receiving $1,000 per month extra, for many workers, with no tax.  That was nixed.  WHY?    Can you imagine the uproar when the holiday ended and you or others saw $1,000 taken out of your paycheck?  Most people don't see the tax on a monthly basis, only their take home.    Interest on that bill?  $347 billion over 10 years.    The majority of economists predict runaway inflation in a few years from now.  Higher interest and less spending.  Read some history of So. America for that.    Even if we see deflation, less spending with the expectation of cheaper prices later, and lower wages chasing prices down.    This congress, all congresses in past, couldn't operate a peanut and popcorn stand.  They'd give away the profits to friends and relatives.

Just handing out money as opposed to making or producing something are two different things.    I know.. why did we give money to banks?  Wouldn't that cause inflation?  Not really.. they aren't loaning any of it out.    It's ok for inflation to occur when there is economic growth.  It is quite another when our economy contracts.    __  Taxes aren't the best way... that's always the solution of supply side econ.    If you cut taxes today, you could not be assured that businesses would reinvest that money into our domestic economy.  It would most likely be spent overseas.    If you cut personal taxes, they will just be saved..... assuming the American people are rational.    Also, when you cut taxes, they seem to always be absorbed by suspicious investments... like mortgage backed securities.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	Its the american tax payers that will get the world out of this mess Bush left.

CnX7zn54aa	Do you mean ethnographic research or ethnographic study? Is it right?    Ethnographic study/ research means when the researchers join one particular community group like Asian, European or Indigenous group for a period of time. The researchers need to involve in the ethnicity group to study about others' culture, value, beliefs and their lifestyles. By joining the community, the researchers have experiences, feelings and face the same problems as the group they study about.  From those activities the researchers will be able to empathise with others. The results that researchers collect will be obvious and less biasness as well as stereotyping. This is because they have the same experiences and they actually involve into the community.    The one above is the definition of Ethnographic study/ Ethnographic research. If you mean Ethnographic research paper, I think this is a plan from the researcher (including how they go out to do it, what will they research, what they need to find out and other information which relate to their research topic)

xmhOrjQLaa	What the hell is a competitive exam? Are we talking elementary, middle, high school? I am totally unfamiliar with the concept. If it is what it sounds like, what a cruel thing to put kids through! As if pressure wasn't enough on young people these days, then to add more stress on our youth by making them compete to see who is the "smartest" is an insult added to injury! Let me tell you from long experience: the people you think are smart will always disappoint you. The standards you hold for gauging intelligence in yourself and others will most assuredly be altered in time. I have known many people who I held in the highest regard because I thought they were the smartest, wisest people on earth, and they all proved themselves of low moral character or faint of wit, lacking in any real tangible intellect at all. Don't hold yourself to any standard other than this: Do only what you can do; never ever give anything less than your absolute best. You will accomplish your goals and dreams if you always apply this philosophy to your life's undertakings.      And one more thing: test results are arbitrary in nature. They are only general tools to gauge your progress, and they do so by putting your results against the backdrop of thousands of other students' results and making the average a "pass" grade. Then there is the bell curve, which pits you against morons and actually lowers your scores to make the morons feel better about themselves. Don't beat yourself up over such a little thing as failing some stupid test. Think better of yourself and you will be better.|`|aIjX0S1uaa	ur a loser|`|UDl8Ac76aa	No, it is not the end.

If you are always on the top, no wonder that you felt this miserable, especially if you got compared to others. There's no need to got embarrassed, people who never fail will never know the real meaning of win. You can still try to be the best. Maybe it sound ridiculous to you, but I had the same experience, always get compared, and I felt that I was in the end of the world when my ranks suddenly drop from the top to the almost bottom, but it's no need to cry over that though. You can still try to achieve the better result, just think it as a stepping stones. Actually it was really fun to chase after the failure, because when you're in top, you always worry someday you'll going down but if you aren't in top, you can always aiming to the top.|`|HpWujntlaa	Competitive exams mean absolutely nothing.

I freak out when I don't get good grades either. What grade are you in? How much is this exam worth? One bad mark for an exam will not stop you from achieving your goals. I'm sure you did fine on your other exams, as I can tell your quite intelligent from your description of yourself. You're not stupid. And, you can get better. All you have to do is find out what methods of studying work best for you. Also, you should find a way to deal with your anxiety, because this will leave your brain in much better condition to absorb information, and then transfer it to paper when your on an exam.    Edit: To JBK - by loser, do you mean someone who is actually trying to make something of themselves, and is worried about achieving their goals?|`|AT1CPDGRaa	It is interesting that you mentioned that your ears got totally red.

PQBEqS8Caa	U seem relatively ignorant abt world cultures. I apologize if i am wrong. But how much do u know abt japan and other asian cultures?  Asians are generally very honorable ppl. They respect and care for their elders unlike here in the west. They also have joint families. So, when u make fun of or offend one person it could be that they feel that their elders are disrespected. This is why they are offended.   It may not be so in the west since u are generally detached from ur family and are not as honorable.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	Because people are too uptight.

In that case, it makes them total douchebags and insensitive jerks. Some people take it personally because culture is shared by a group of people. Hence, if you say something about a culture, what you say pretty much is directed to people within that culture.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	they will though.....theyre humans..|`|CHPuw61Uaa	I think that's how more collectivistic societies, such as Japan, work. You dishonor somebody, you also dishonor their family, their friends, maybe their whole culture.    It's not necessarily a bad idea. It seems to me that such a system would encourage people to encourage *eachother* to be honorable, to prevent dishonor from spreading.
1NA1KvA8aa	First off, avoid Autism Speaks at all costs.  It is highly anti-autistic.     There are some movies that specifically mention people with AS or HFA, such as Mozart and the Whale or Snowcake.  However, these are typically overdone and too obvious.    In the movie P.S. I Love You, the character Daniel has AS.  One of the better portrayals I've seen - it's never specifically mentioned (he does make a joke about pills for rudeness, though it is obviously a joke, and he does mention "I have a disorder...I don't have a filter").    The other good portrayals I've seen are on The Big Bang Theory (TV series on CBS).  Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, and Wolowitz all appear to have AS to varying degrees - Sheldon the most severe of them.      And of course, learning as much as you can about the disorder, and talking to and interacting with actual Aspies should help a lot.|`|wRPuGTHMaa	In Batman and Robin, they did not have Asperger's.

The biggest thing about the syndrome is the lack of ability to change, and to some extent compulsive behaviour.     Your character would have trouble conversing with people with a flexible style, and your conversation may be one-track. You may also not be aware of your actions as percieved by others, and this manifests in shouting when a normal person would be quiet, raucous laughter at inapropiate times and sudden overreaction to a not-uncommon event.|`|dIxATqQoaa	The skinny on Aspergers is a lack of facial expressions and lack of tone and pitch in voice, while being very analytical.

AA12140689	Aspergers syndrome is a mild form of autism. Most individuals with Aspergers syndrome are high functioning. People with Aspergers syndrome lack social skills and have obsessive interests, but they have normal or above average intelligence and no speech delay. Many have sensory issues, poor motor skills and other problems.    Aspie is an affectionate term and is used a lot by people with Aspergers syndrome. Not everyone likes this word though, because some feel like its a label and they dont want to be labelled. I doubt anyone finds it insulting though, people just have different preferences about what theyd like to be called.|`|kHsDVN7aaa	general these people are fairly normal. they can fuction in society just fine. however they do tend to have some social issues such as having trouble making eye contact, saying things that maybe shouldnt be said, and have trouble when things dont go excatly as planned. for the most part these people are very bright though. this will explain better than i can!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_sy...|`|VELnLnIKaa	aspergers.com or web md|`|DRPhJnXzaa	What is Aspergers syndrome?     Aspergers syndrome is a developmental disorder in which people have severe difficulties understanding how to interact socially.    People with Asperger's syndrome have some traits of autism, especially weak social skills and a preference for sameness and routine. But unlike those with autism, children with Asperger's syndrome usually start to talk before 2 years of age (when speech normally starts to develop).     Both Asperger's syndrome and autism belong to the group of disorders called pervasive developmental disorders. As many as 3 out of 10,000 people have Asperger's syndrome.       I dont think its cool to call them aspies at all if they want to refer to themselves as that then so be it|`|AA12196812	It seems that the term Aspies comes from within the Asperger syndrome community and is considered affectionate and appropriate. I might be wrong. Pretty much the only place you really hear this term is on forums dedicated to the syndrom. I would not call it slang.    Basically people with Asperger's have diminished or no ability to understand other people or relate to them. In his book "Blink" M. Gladwell describes an experiment where they let people watch an intensely dramatic scene from movies, a woman and a man talking and she's very upset. The researchers recorded eye movements of people. So this Asperger's guy was looking at the light switch on the wall the entire time. All tht drama meant nothing to him at all, so he was looking at the only thing that did mean something.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	it's a mild form of autism however, people with asperger's are high functioning.

That sounds like an insult.  Autism is not something to be joked about like that.  Especially when the spectrum is so big now and includes so many people who can't function well in society.  You're right it's impolite, and whoever is using the term should be corrected.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	It's a mild, but complicated, form of autism - people with it have some emotional and learning difficulties but are often gifted in certain areas.  It can be lived with well and many people with it blend into society with little problem.  They may be quieter, appear withdrawn and in their own world at times and tend to work hard.  They can be possessive and and not fond of change.      And no - it's not very polite to call them "Aspies".  They're people, just like everyone else and we all have our problems.
AA10719402	Money backed by gold isn't all it's cracked up to be.    First of all, we would be subjected to gold shortages and surpluses that would cause contractions and inflations on its own... not manmade.    Second, we would find ourselves backed by a finite source of money and will eventually have to go to a fractional gold reserve system.  With growth comes more money... if your money can't grow, your economy can't either.    And I suggest you look into what Churchill did after the war.  Keynes warned against it, but Churchill insisted on returning the money to the pre-war gold standard.  Hard times ensued and Churchill has said that it was the worst thing he did in his career.    Might I also add that the Fed is independent for a reason.  If it were owned by the government (people) you would have a politization problem.  Dems and Reps would all lower interest rates and pump money in because no president wants to bear the burden of raising interest rates.      Just ask Jimmy Carter.  The Federal Reserve's actions during that time are often thought of as things Carter did himself.  He's rep. never recovered.    Is the Federal Reserve and our debt the best thing in the world.. no.  But neither is gold.. or walnuts... or cocoa beans.. or whatever other arbitrary thing we all assign value to.|`|604963ef82ec90b5bd0becdfe005c25eaa	Yes, let's eliminate the Federal Reserve Bank and the IRS!

That portion is retained by the Federal Reserve System to increase capital.  Feel free to coin your own money.  A number of private mints do exactly that, although they are simply commemorative.  Still, if people chose to use them as money there is no law against it.  Federal Reserve Notes are backed by the coinage of the US Mint, but do you really want paid in nickles?    A private currency system like Scotland's has long been proposed but it would take an important funding source from Congress and they hate giving up money.
YQOT68xFaa	It depends on the stress. I find that if it isn't a very big stress, then spending more time with my husband and kids really helps. But if the stress is big enough, both men and women sometimes retreat into themselves and just hide out for a while until they can handle things better. It happens as a coping mechanism. But it isn't healthy to stay there. After a while you have to come back out of the shell again. Because you're right, it does help to spend more time with others when you're feeling really stressed! It takes your mind off your problems and helps you see that life doesn't totally suck.|`|84gK4XlHaa	If I'm understanding the question correctly, I would have to say that this a complete generalization that really has nothing to do with gender.  Different people deal with stress in different ways.  I know plenty of women (myself included) who respond to stress by hitting the bars and drinking it away.  I'm not saying I'm proud of this, but it does happen at lot.  Similarly, I know a lot of men who completely shut down emotionally if something is bothering them.  I actually think it's more related to whether you have an introverted or extroverted personality than your gender.|`|WzWaz9hvaa	No offense intended here mate, but maybe she just doesn't want to spend time with you at the moment and she is trying to spare your feelings.|`|iqqQLSDDaa	I agree that it's a personality rather than a gender issue. I've known guys who just completely shut off from everyone and everything when they're having a rough time.     But, if someone is going through a rough time, showing a little compassion never hurts.     Because your question is a little rambling it's difficult to figure out what you're going on about...but if someone is turning you down because they have "issues they need to work out", it may be a way of letting you down easily.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	How can we not?

So by resolving the personal issues  first, chances of a successful social life are much more  promising.

"Why do some women who are stressed out, and  is in a state of crisis, have a tendency to block out or put off their  personal life." - As opposed to taking the men who want to be with them for a ride and bringing them down as well? I prefer the former. Let her sort her issues out and then get back to me. I don't want to date a live pandora's box.    Also, being in a relationship can sometimes be demanding particularly in its early stages. I'm not for compartmentalizing life into 'dating years' and 'fixing my life years', but I have always admired people who can take up one thing at a time and finish it to perfection rather than fill their plates and churn out ugly products.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	What you say is certainly true.  And if you are actually important to her, she'd explain what these issues are and why they are so dire and must be tended to so immediately.

5HTylrjGaa	I don't think this is an Oriental society vs. Western society question.    In either society, if someone in a relationship is really uncomfortable with something the other person is doing, the other person should make an effort to make the person more comfortable.    You are uncomfortable with her hanging out/talking to her guy friends late at night. I doubt you'd feel much better if she was talking to them several hours during the day. But it doesn't seem like she has tried to do anything about it.     While in a Western society it is more likely that a girl would have guy friends and stay out and drink with them...etc, if a boyfriend was uncomfortable with it, even girls here would do something about it. Maybe they would bring their boyfriend along with her and her friend, or try to get back earlier, or cut down on how many times they go out.    Have you ever heard of emotional cheating? It is when someone is emotionally involved with another person (without sex or kissing) with another person. Although it seems fine at the first time, it can really get in the way of relationships because it doesn't allow for you to bond with your actual boyfriend. I think this is what may be going on here.|`|AA10907244	Well, it could be purely innocent. She's young and clearly wants to experience the crap the most young people do. However, it's not healthy at all.    If I were you, I would ask if it was cool to tag along once or twice. Perhaps you can see how she reacts: if she gets excited that you are coming alone, then good :) If she doesn't seem to want you there, then it might be a lil' problem.    I've had a girlfriend in the past that always hung around guys. It sucked. It drove me crazy. She should understand that it's natural to be concerned.    Btw, you're Korean :) Go and buy her World of Warcraft or something so she stays home all day.|`|R2XDlMqTaa	to put it simply.she is not ready to make a comittment and you are.she is westernized to an extent. but she is not ready to committ to a relationship with anyone. you may need to find your soulmate somewhere else, or get used to sharing her with other men. and dude even here you don't share your girl with other men...the other man disrespects you by it and she is disrespecting you if you are a couple, she is just using you as her *****(to put it bluntly )if i were you i would cut my losses and find a new girlfreind.one who is looking for the same things you are looking for in life(comittment)good luck...|`|yoJNAihhaa	It's not unusual for a woman to have a social life outside of her romantic one. So I wouldn't necessarily worry about her going out with her friends. That said, hanging out with one man after 1am in a bar usually has certain connotations. And that is something to be concerned about. It could just be that he is a very good friend, but it's still iffy. I think you should talk to her about it because it seems that some of your feelings are not being reciprocating. One thing that could contribute to that is the age difference. You being older are probably ready to settle, but her, being young may still want to partake in all the things that being in one's early twenties has to offer. I think you both should talk to make sure that both of you are understanding the other so you can bridge whatever gap may be opening up in your relationship. Good luck.|`|0rpS2b97aa	I think that it depends on the situation.  If they are lifelong friends in public places...not a big deal if you know that nothing further is going on.  With that said, her friends being her priority all the time might be a problem.  This might be due the immaturity. Maybe she is not ready to be in the same type relationship that you are.  I think if the situation was right, you would not have these questions.|`|aZi6BvBraa	I dont think its a Western thing, I am a Western girl and i dont think that her behaviour is normal.

If I were in your situation I would feel cheated.|`|DhQMzN52aa	Yeah it's acceptable, she's young and enjoying her life, family has let her down so she lives for her friends, nothing wrong with that.  You could tell her that you're not happy with the situation but then you risk her leaving you for someone who accepts who she is and allows her to lead her own life without trying to control it.    What's that saying about if you hold onto love to tightly you will only break it, or something along those lines....|`|uhchod38aa	I think your girlfriend is very young and it is natural for her to want to go out with her friends. However, if she is going out with the same male friend after midnight to a bar...well, she's dating him.

She may love you, but I do not think she is ready to have a serious relationship.|`|71mE0r7kaa	That isn't acceptable for a woman to do in a western culture either if she is in a relationship. I live in the US and I wouldn't do that. I am 25.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	As a westerner myself, I can't really know if there's a noticeable difference between our mindsets as a whole. What I agree with is relationships are unique as are the people involved.     Jealousy and possessiveness are romantic and all that BUT, they are counter-productive to relationships. The statement "She says that she is suffocated by my excessive jealousy and interference in her privacy." - may or may not show that you are actually jealous or possessive, because they are relative terms, but she has said that. That is the fact. You can try thinking about what you did to her, or what she did to make you do it, and probably work towards changing her perceptions about you and your relationship. However, if I were to be in this situation, I would move on and find a compatible person. There's a big sea out there with plenty of fish in it, and we are quite young to find ourselves in this situation instead of enjoying our lives.    Good luck !|`|FLLVtAdEaa	I don't think this would be very acceptable in western culture either buddy|`|64eba52b7a7dcdb30b1e7b1223d7eb33aa	maybe you should be looking at other women.....and tell her that you are only seeing friends...........don't take her too seriously.....have fun!!......................................        HAVE FUN............|`|iHKJsyfTaa	In this instance ,I would say it's not about what is acceptable to a culture, rather what is acceptable to you.    Try this , next time she is going to go out drinking with her friends , tell her " Wonderful , so am I , I'm going to go to a club and drink with a group of men and women and have some fun too "    Or you could do what I would have already,, dump and replace her with one that fits you better.    You're not going to change her and it's apparent you are not comfortable as things are.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Hm. I don't think that sounds like a very good situation. She's up late alone with this guy....it sounds to me like maybe she's got more than just friendship feelings for him.     I think your complaint is justifiable in our culture too. Bottom line: if she is unwilling to compromise, if she insists on continuing seeing this guy and acting towards him like she should be acting towards you....maybe you guys aren't such a good match, you know? Maybe it's time to break things off.     By the way - your English is excellent.   : )|`|wkjncmHTaa	Perfectly acceptable, yes. If you're not happy with it I suggest you discuss it with her, but personally I would perceive asking her not to see her friends as a little controlling. It looks like the two of you aren't really compatible.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	Yes|`|AA10628838	Even if I am a Westerner, be warned that this does lead to eventual cheating and should not be acceptable. You will find others who say it is innocent and not to worry, but this is not true. When a couple is in a committed relationship you shouldn't look outside the relationship for someone else's company and companionship.|`|o1pXRFtUaa	I don't really think this is normal in western culture. I think your girlfriend is being very selfish.. she needs to understand how you feel and if she really loved you, she wouldn't be doing things that make you upset. She would want to do anything to make you happy (as long as your doing everything to make her happy- its a balance) I know if my girlfriend was out late at night with other guys I would be pissed! It's not that your jealous or even interfering with her privacy...its not right that shes hanging out with these guys. She should at least involve you in her nights out.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	I think that you should take a clue in that you say "she is suffocated by my excessive jealousy and interference in her privacy".    I would be suffocated by someone who wanted to tell me how to behave, after all I am an adult.  So is she.   You are far more committed than she is - move on.      Your writing just set warning lights off in my mind.   One of the first signs of a abuser is that they try to isolate their victim from friends and family.    They start slowly, first its at certain times, then certain days, they constantly call and have to know where the victim is......|`|1cde960f92f3cf52ea9b7b2bff72b659aa	I think what your gf is doing is unjustifiable in any culture in any country.     I can understand the fact that she needs to be with her friends (but that should be occassionaly, not all the time)     Why don't you go with her to these clubs?    When I got married, he was 8 years older than me. I was 20, he was 28.... I still wanted to party, he had done all of that and wanted to sit home and watch tv.  I did what he wanted and let's just say...I got bored, I felt trapped and held down.  Not saying he did it to hurt me or on purpose, but it did end up in divorce.     So maybe you should try to be a little more understanding, but at the same time, she can't be talking to other guys late at night and going out drinkinjg with them all the time either. One guy and one girl out in a club drinking... somethings not right there.    Maybe you should find a female friend to go out with and drink late at night..see how much she likes it ;)|`|iRKOJhYeaa	haha we know where Korea is, but its because of her age. Girls that age love to go out and spend time with their girlfriends having fun.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Why are people from the East always prepared to blame any kind of vulgar or loutish behavior on Westernization? That is just your own girlfriend's behavior, of course not every Korean woman is like this nor is every Western woman. If you are uncomfortable with it that means you are incompatible with her. 10 years is a significant age difference especially if she is in her early 20s. She may not be the best match for you. I personally wouldn't hang out with male friends after midnight in bars without my boyfriend, if I were in a committed relationship. I would talk to my male friends of course but ignoring my boyfriend and talking to a male friend for hours on the phone at 1am is just an insult to my boyfriend.|`|3J3IH2maaa	HELL NO!!!!!!!!!!! That is so not acceptable over here!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|edglcOydaa	sorry but I cant be arsed to read all that....can you do a short version|`|ftbIWNydaa	Yes it is.|`|iqqQLSDDaa	It's normal for most people to have close friends of both genders.    However, if she's spending way more time with her friends than she is with you, then I would understand you being upset/concerned.    I always think staying out late with a member of the opposite sex is a gray area though...and really shouldn't be done if the other person in the relationship is unhappy about it.|`|WzWaz9hvaa	It doesn't matter which society you are part of.   You should not try to monopolize her time. She wants to be free to enjoy herself. So set her free, go find someone who will appreciate you for who you are. :)|`|1Crt9jQXaa	It does sound like a western thing.  I have friends (both men and women) who are always out with members of the opposite sex, and calling them, even if they are in a relationship.  I would be upset too if I were you. But don't worry, not everyone is like that. She is just young and wants to have fun.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Her behavior is probably more common in western society, but I think even western guys would be having similar concerns. While it's common for young people to hang out at bars until all hours with friends, it's not a good sign if she's just hanging out with ONE guy until all hours. If she's with a group of male and female friends and they get in late, then it's not really a cause for concern, but if you see her attaching herself to one guy friend in particular, then you may want to see if there's something more to that friendship.|`|3VLvEeRUaa	No, I'd say it wouldn't be acceptable in Western culture. I have a lot of friends who would never do that to their boyfriends. There's a delicate balance that I think your girlfriend is not achieving. Spending that much time with her guy friends, and at such late hours, is asking for trouble. Eventually, something is going to happen. The question is: why doesn't she want to spend her nights talking with you on the phone, or drinking with you at a bar? You should ask her that, and then I think it'll be easy enough to judge if she loves you or not.
dDcX1NNOaa	You're not even close to the first kid to feel this way. You know why the argument you make dies after a while? Because all kids grow up to become adults with responsibilities.    It's good that you can observe that attitude in some adults. You'll be sure not to become that kind of adult. But I would caution that if you can't meet adults that are not like this then either it's your own insecurity that's shaping your dramatic perception or you need to break out of the environments you're in and meet new people.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	i dont think i am smarter than anyone, although i believe ithe longer you live you naturally know more about life than a young person doe. not because we are smarter , but simply because we have lived longeer and seen more. i think young people are a lot smarter today than what we were at your age.  you have a lot better chance to get a good education than what people in my age group had. but you can really learn a lot about life if you listen to  older people.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Either you have some sort of characteristic that makes people WANT to be an a**hole to you, or you're just surrounded by pricks.  A normal, mentally stable adult will never 'flaunt' to a younger person. It is indeed pathetic, just as you say. Any mature adult should try and give you confidence, not take it away from you.    What I notice is that many young people these days are so ghetto, so smartmouthed and, in fact, uneducated and honestly, ignorant even for their age. Now I hate to say it but it sounds like maybe you're one of those type.  If you are then you need to realize it and to something about it. If I'm wrong then cool, sounds like you're just hanging around a bunch of screwed up losers.    Something isn't right with this picture though. That's for sure.|`|9c7a3bd67fbfe6f08d3a5f7e9144b19caa	LOL. You just wait, kid.

But there's a way to deliver [brutal] honesty without making it harsh or hurtful. (If the honesty is something I'd perceive to be negative)|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes I prefer honesty but it doesn`t have to be brutal....|`|dBkEqT2naa	Brutal honesty. But it depends on who it is coming from, how they deliver their message, how they make a conclusion about you to act upon it.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Straight up honesty is the only way to go.  However that seems to go against 99.9% of what people are looking for on answers.|`|c2f7ef4507c724db34ebbcc925ef59e1aa	Honesty, definitely. Although I don't like it when people give a one-sided and harsh evaluation. One must consider all sides of the situation.|`|fkQUCwUhaa	just a simple honest opinion.|`|wT9QSAOeaa	A brutal honesty..  It gives us motivation to improve..|`|dDcX1NNOaa	Very detailed honesty which can sometimes be interpreted as being brutal.
xGb2CBgkaa	a nice article below that talks about high unemployment in europe.    personally, i think it's b/c:    -  higher cost of each employee in europe due to employee protections, benefits and minimum wages is the main culprit.    -  germany has higher corporate and income taxes, which dampens the growth rate of smaller growth companies.  small companies are the drivers of economic growth and job creation.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	well i'm not sure what the rate is in your country, but it most likely depends on the entitlement rate and the amount business is taxed. it might be wise for you to keep track of the rate here in the US because you'll see how government will bring you more problems than they can fix.

FhyYpuiUaa	Depends on what your definition of "weakness" is.     -The death penalty not being a great deterrent of crime  -Being jailed for "lesser" crimes (i.e., drug possession)  -Recidivism rates of criminals/programs to help repeat offenders (either not working, or not enough programs)  -White collar criminals and the crimes they are often not jailed for (white collar crime is a HUGE problem, but often we just glance over it.  But jerks like Madoff and Blagojevich will get what's coming)  -Too many criminals, not enough prisons  -Prior records and ex-criminals not finding jobs    Just look up "criminology theories" and read about some of the theories (labeling theory, social learning theory, etc.)|`|AA11658197	like DAN said the inmate population due to drug possession is amazing, those cells should be primarily used for incarceration of violent and repeat offenders. Your killers, rapists, molesters and high dollar crimes against society.  They say by inprisoning drug offenders they are detouring violence in the future, but that's a cop out.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	In my humble opinion our biggest weakness is using crime for political 'fear peddling' and revenue flow generation. Crime stats are quoted in election campaigns. Arrest/conviction numbers are used to sometimes show how much crime there is and at other times to show what a good job is being done to combat it. Privatized prisons have become big business. People are in prison at tax payer expense that really should be outside being productive and paying taxes. Not to say they didn't commit crimes or shouldn't be paying the price. But then, if you run a privatized prison, who do you want in your beds? People that will damage your facility and injure your employees? Or docile people that will 'be nice' while in your care? And gee, just look at how 'good' it is for the economy to construct all those buildings and employ all those guards....  Prisons were originally intended to segregate the worst of the worst from polite society and perhaps as an example to others to help keep them in line. Now, 'crime' is big business on both sides of the line.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Half of our crimes are drug related, foisted on us by Big Pharma so they can sell more,not better, drugs of their own.

And most people aren't "frugal" at all.    The Economy has been artificially maintained for too long, and needs to get into a more sustainable mode. Quick fixes and wild spending will not do this.|`|acVPPTD2aa	Nah is just being conservative and smart with your money.|`|K6KeN7sgaa	Not really, no.    Americans living beyond their means is definitely one of the weakest links in the economy.    A country which has a solid, strong, substantial SAVINGS base is very important for the FOUNDATION of the economy. Your money sitting in a savings account doesn't just sit there, you know. The banks USE the money, for loans (for small businesses to get started) and for CAR loans and for HOME mortgages.    The more money YOU save, the more BUSINESS the banks can do.    Thus stimulating the economy! Plus, YOU get interest off of it, and the reassurance of having a personal safety net.|`|rcRoF7WNaa	Banks need money.  Keep your money in the bank.  It may not increase in interest as much as it would have 12 months ago, but you'll still be better off.    Don't go into debt.  There's no certainty that you'll pay it off.    Look after yourself and just spend your money on what you need and DEFINATLY don't go into debt.  Bankruptcy will only hurt the economy more.|`|AA11071860	True. Nevertheless to spend money in tough economic times could end up causing a lot fiscal pain. The economy runs in cycles, and right now we are in a vicious cycle. No one spends, busineses don't make profits and lay off people. When people are laid off, people are more reluctant to spend an businesses lay off more people. The only way to break this vicious cycle is by government intervention, injecting billions to get people to feel comfortable about spending.|`|W0CpNeLAaa	well...i think its all depend on economy|`|19sa1ITfaa	YES!!!!!!|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Exactly being smart and making better decision where you can make your money last longer is the solution. We can't stop spending, we have to eat, travel, wear clothes, buy things for the house, cleaners, etc|`|AA10645224	YES    YOU SHOULD SEND ALL YOUR MONEY TO ME|`|z0B0fyT6aa	I think instead of giving everyone bailout money, or tax return money, they should split the billions of dollars, give equal money to everyone who is a citizen.... and think about it... if 25,000 or 100,000 dollars fell into your lap from the government, you would not only love your government, but you wouldn't just sit on it and not use it.... people would be BUYING things, and helping to up money circulation....BUYING houses, and paying off debt...

vAdtlZDpaa	To dream of jail indicates feeling restricted, confined, trapped. The number three signifies life, vitality, inner strength, completion, imagination, creativity, energy, and self-exploration. Perhpas you feel that these things have been curtailed in your life.     Three also stands for trilogy as in the past, present, and future or father, mother, and child, etc.     To dream of illness in your dream denotes despair, unpleasant changes, or some emotional breakdown. The illness may be symbolic of your inability to cope with a situation and you see that being ill is an easy way out.     Even though you dreamed that these things happened to your friend, the people in our dreams represent different aspects of our own personality. Your friend may have certain qualities that pertain to your situation in this dream.     It sounds like something upsetting has happened in your waking life, and you were using this dream to process your feelings about it.|`|BWQ8EMzEaa	www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary

45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	You might seriously think about studying anthropology and or psychology.    Anthropology is the science of man, and psychology is about what is going on in man's psyche and how human behaviour functions.

People will act a certain way until they realize there will be some consequences if their true colors don't show. I'll use 2 examples to try to illustrate, the 1st is a controversial topic.  An inexperienced, irresponsible guy is with a gal. He has talked the talk of how he loves her etc. Without planning, she finds out they have conceived a child. Now that this is real and there's no going back, he's wants an abortion.  That's just one isolated example, but I've personally seen it happen. The pressure comes and people's true colors show. This isn't a stance one way or the other about abortion. Just an illustration.  On the other hand, some people will act all mean all the time, but when pressure comes, they'll stand up for what they feel is the right thing to do.  Both examples show that pressure will bring out a person's true nature.|`|eibO5ax3aa	Probably their inherent belief system. Most people, ultimately, operate from this.

xGb2CBgkaa	Ok, the stuff that jim is saying is horseraddish (sorry, jim).    the reason why food prices you see in the supermarkets were rising is because of two things, one is a healthy growth of demand for american agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat, etc) around the globe, and the increase in oil prices.    what did oil prices have to do with corn?  when oil was trading at $140 per barrel, the corn lobby was able to get congress to pass a number of tax incentives and other legislation that supported the use of corn to produce ethanol.  so more corn was used for ethanol, and less corn was used for agriculture.  similarly, a lot of farmers saw that the good money was in growing corn for ethanol, so they planted less wheat and less of other things and more of corn.  btw, what's why beer prices shot up, too.  farmers were planting much less of hops, which is necessary for beer, and so hops prices skyrocketed.  and so did beef, pork and chicken because they are fed corn.    of course, as oil prices fell, so did the prices of things like corn and wheat.  check out the links below for corn and wheat.  if you compared these with the price of oil, you will see a very strong relationship.  ever notice that in the last year, not much discount in cereals?      it will take a couple of quarters for these price reductions to make it to your supermarket.  but as it does, you'll see it less in terms of permanent price reductions and more in terms of sales of things like cereal!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Gas prices were only part of the equation.    Flour, rice, and corn were trading at ridiculous prices recently and most foodstuffs are carb dependent. The manufacturers were used to paying pennies on the dollar...and suddenly found the cost of flour and others grains increasing exponentially.    You also need to consider how much of our food is now being imported from around the world...and the cost picture starts to look grim. Even local growers got whacked by gas prices during their prime growng season, so the savings you could usually count were also off.    I have always been mystified at how they calculate inflation, and GNP, since in recent years, neither took consumer goods into consideration.|`|64SObnr5aa	That is one of the big problems when you have few suppliers, few wholesalers and few retailers.    We have corporate farming, where less then 1/2 percent of the people are farmers.  Huge mechanized monopolies run by a few huge companies.      They have passed on the price of fuel to you, then will reduce your price slowly as the public demands it, thus increasing their profits.    Thus, because food prices are so high our government must subsidize the people who can not afford those prices through our food stamp program.  That was at about 13% prerecession levels, I suspect it is about 17%-20% now    Where I live, as a transplanted American in China, 47% of the people are farmers.  There is a lot of competition because of that.  The farms can be more competitive and give far lower prices because most of them do not depend on costly machinery, expensive fertilizers or transportation.  The cities also do not have the urban sprawl we have, having mostly multi story housing.  Thus, cities like the two I have lived in are surrounded by farmland and the local farmers bring their products to market at dirt cheap prices.  How about a head of cabbage for 8 cents?  Or a pound of apples for the same price?  Get my point?    Keep in mind, our population has 300 million, China has 1.3 billion, about 4 times more then ours, and they are roughly the same size as us with less arable land.  If they can provide their population with an abundance of food, virtually no one on public food stamps, and competitive farming, why can't we?    The answer is simple, huge corporate farms and a government that is lobbied by that, thus our food costs are extremely high and will remain high till we get off this insane greed of corporate conglomerates that do not have the peoples needs at heart, but only their shareholders and bottom line of huge profits.    Peace  Jim    .
vAdtlZDpaa	To see a house in your dream, represents your own soul and self. In your dream you bought part of a house, which could indicate changing part of your personality or psyche. I don't know what the $45,000 refers to, but it might mean something to you personally. For example, the number "1965" could mean the year 1965.      You can also add up the digits until you get one number, which in this case would be 9.  Nine denotes completion and that you are on a productive path. Rebirth, inspiration and reformation. You are seeking to improve the world.    Five represents your persuasiveness, spontaneity, daring/bold nature, action or the five human senses. This number may reflect a change in course. It is also the link between heaven and earth.     In your dream your bf leaves you, which leaves you feeling vulnerable. This could indicate a loss of the more "masculine" (intellectual, rational, assertive) aspect of your personality, and which may leave you feeling vulnerable with only feminine (emotional) qualities.     Cigarettes - could signify your need for a break or point to issues of  dependency.     Wine - refers to festivity, celebration, and companionship.     Lamb - represent all that is vulnerable, pure and innocent. Consider the metaphor "as gentle as a lamb".     Cheese - symbolizes gains and profits. Or it could be saying that you need to smile more.      Waitressing - To dream that you are a waiter or waitress indicates that you are catering to the demands of others instead of your own. You feel that you are waiting on somebody hand and foot and are not being appreciated. Perhaps you need to be more assertive and stand up for yourself.    Six is indicative of cooperation, balance, tranquility, perfection, warmth, union, marriage, family, and love. Your mental, emotional, and spiritual states are in harmony.  It is also indicative of domestic bliss.    Overall I think this is a dream about your need for companionship, dependence on your boyfriend, and desire to please and cater to others juxtaposed against your movement towards being more assertive and independent so that you can be a happier and more complete person.|`|BWQ8EMzEaa	www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary    that site is fun! you can look up any dreams! i have a blast on it all the time!

dDcX1NNOaa	No, there are always underlying problems with the individual. Certainly violent actions can be obtained and imitated from books, television, movies and video games. But there are no studies that link the root causes of behavioral problems to violent media.    How people act out and WHY people act out are 2 completely different aspects of observation.|`|9c7a3bd67fbfe6f08d3a5f7e9144b19caa	I don't think they're necessarily the cause of behaviors, but violence in many forms... tv, video games, etc. definitely influence and encourage negative and disruptive behaviors.    I think more than anything it de-sensitizes children to violence|`|atJxwFssaa	I don't know whether they can cause behavioural problems but they affect emotions.|`|wT9QSAOeaa	Yes, mostly it happens to the children..  They think that violent is cool and shows how powerful they are..|`|HpWujntlaa	It really depends on the child and the parent. If a child and a parent can come together and make sure the child understands the difference between video games and reality and understand that violence is not the answer, then there's really no problem with it. To be perfectly honest, blaming video games is just a way bad parents can get away with failing to teach their children everything they need to know about self control.|`|RAw3mZkQaa	Violent video games and good behaviour are not mutually exclusive.  What a lot of people fail to understand or point out (the hyper-reactive media included) is that there are a lot more factors than video games that spark violent or bad behaviour in children.    Parenting and social intereaction also play vital roles.  Bad parenting has been shown to lead to bad bahavior in children.  Violent behaviour is often a direct result of personal neglect, i.e. children behaving in a certain way in order to gain some attention.    Personally I have been playing games on and off since I was 10 and am now 21.  I was never allowed to play games with certificates over my age and my parents were constantly interacting with me and helping me to learn, teaching me good values, etc...  A lot of the games I played were violent and I do not have a violent or bad behavioural streak in my at all.  In fact I've just finished a politics degree and am currently training to be a solicitor.    At the end of the day age certificates are on games for a reason.  12 year olds shouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto for example, and parents doing their job as guardians and teachers from an early age instead of letting their children run riot, goes a long way to ensuring that children are not badly behaved or violent.    The problem in society today is that we are always looking for a scape goat.  Violent children?  Could it be the parents?  No that would create too much work for social services.  Blame it on video games and it's much easier.    Studies which have shown violent games to be synonymous with violent behaviour in the past have typically left out important information, and in actual fact most studies of certain types of games such as 'first person shooters' or 'massively multiplayer online' games have been shown to improve critical reaction time and social abilities respectively.    Hope this helps.
cteyFJxhaa	You're absolutely right that there's no specific age for every woman.  Just like not every girl starts her period at 12 years old.  As for what happens....I suppose that would vary from person to person as well.|`|WkQRC8Bzaa	Statistics don't indicate what your experience will be, nor does Yahoo. Just enjoy yourself.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	I think that women reach their "sexual peak" when they get old enough to be comfortable in their skin and understand/appreciate their sexuality. Women spend years hating themselves and their bodies and repressing their sexuality. A lot of women in their late 20s and 30s get tired of it and start expressing their true sexuality, and it brings them to their "sexual peak". That's just my opinion anyway. I'm 22 and I have embraced my sexuality and am not fearful of it. I have a very high sex drive and probably am in some kind of sexual peak, but I like to think that the best is yet to come. :)|`|71mE0r7kaa	A woman could go through that earlier. Yes it would depend on the women and other genetic factors. I have always heard the age was around 30-40. So that leads me to think that it will be a few years of going through it. I don't know for sure cause i haven't experienced that yet. But that is my idea of it. But a woman can orgasm at any age as far as I know. You just get a higher sex drive at those ages.

Biologically , I'm not sure, but as far as behavior I know that women at this stage do indeed have a significantly increased libido, it's very cool.    Women around 35 are up for a roll in the hay anytime , anywhere,  none of this " Oh I'm soooo tired" stuff.    I have always attributed it to the woman's body knowing her eggs are running out and making a 'last ditch' effort to get knocked up before it's too late.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	you want sex more|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	orgasm   u can have it at any age and i think menopause is the sexual peak  idk really no idea|`|iRKOJhYeaa	I reached mine in my mid 30s, oh wow!

vAdtlZDpaa	To see a spider in your dream indicates that you are feeling like an outsider in some situation. Or that you may want to keep your distance and stay away from an alluring and tempting situation.  The spider is also symbolic of feminine power. Alternatively, a spider may refer to a powerful force protecting you against your self-destructive behavior.    The number 2 stands for balance, diversity, partnership, soul, or receptivity. It can also symbolize double weakness or double strength. There is a duality as in male and female, mother and father, yin and yang, etc.     To dream of a dryer suggests that you need to start dealing with your emotions.    Walking in a dream is symbolic of making slow, steady progress.    To see green grass in your dream suggests that there is a part of yourself that you can always rely on. The dream is also symbolic of natural protection. Also consider the phrase "the grass is always greener on the other side." In your dream the grass was wet. Water in dreams signifies emotions.    To see slugs in your dream indicates that you are progressing through life in a slow, steady, and persistent manner. You may be moving painfully slowly toward a goal. Are you feeling sluggish?     To dream that slugs are coming out from inside your body suggests that you are having difficulties expressing some aspect of your emotion. Consider where in your body are the slugs coming out from.  To see a mouth in your dream, signifies your need to express yourself or talk about an issue that's bothering you. To see your own eyes in your dream, represents enlightenment, knowledge, comprehension, understanding, and intellectual awareness. Unconscious thoughts may be coming onto the surface.    You have several repetitive themes in this dream:  - making slow, steady progress and  - not expressing your emotions.    I would guess that something happened in your waking life that caused you to feel left out or upset you somehow, and this dream is a way for your to process your feelings, and a message from your subconscious to express your emotions in your waking life and to keep plugging along!|`|BWQ8EMzEaa	www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary

Linguistics, you will study language and everything about them (how they came to be, their impact, etc.)    Cultural, you will examine the human race, both living and dead.

Archaelogy, you will study human things of the past.|`|e2J4r10Raa	Well an anthropologist studies human remains, different cultures and peoples.

So..to answer your question...It's actually..."all three" in a sense and as a quintessence...It's just pure creativity "in general" !    The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves.

AA11735109	i was in 6th grade...the guy sitting next to me said "i love her...." for this girl in our class...since it was a free period for us with a substitute male teacher in the class, we were bored, and i happened to pen his words down and signing his name (for some reason the words "i love you / her" used to be a great deal at that time) and i handed over the piece of paper to him. another guy sitting at the far end on his side saw me giving him a note and was curious, we did not tell him what the note said and so he told on us to the teacher shouting in front of the whole class "sir, ashish is passing a chit to vishwendra". the teacher called me to his desk with the piece of paper. he saw it and punished me - "stand at the back of the class".    that was the most humiliating moment of my life as lunch break followed that period and i had to stand for whole of the lunch too and people even from other classes came to see "me". especially the girls were being real b!tches which humiliated me more, and of course i was "nervous", to answer your question :-)|`|Acwau1Esaa	Driving test or flying for the first time.|`|NbAGauDmaa	Going to meet a extremely rich client who judges people. i am still scared when i am sent to him but i try to keep a straight face.|`|fe45797c45f48ecace41d6efe7c9241eaa	When I married my second husband I couldn't stop shaking when we were at the altar.

Even before he was turned over and layed on my chest, none of those petty things even crossed my mind, I was just so happy I was able to meet him. Well, he didn't live this life long but I was nothing less than blessed that we had what we had. And all his "deformities" were nothing less than Absolutely loveable.|`|9dNPN9CSaa	From ages of 10-23, I had such a bad stutter that it took 3 whole breaths to say yes to the school register    Even at age 10, we were hearing @ bigger & bigger bombs, worse & worse violent crime    Only the Prince of Peace is the Sole Soul Supplier    He alone gives the 'peace past understanding'    I came into Y/A with this Word 4 Today that fits very well here, to help the nervous folk drawn to the question:-    Praying to Our Father   R.C. Sproul    Renewing Your Mind    The next time you attend a prayer meeting, pay close attention to the manner in which individuals address God.     Invariably, the form of address will be something like this, "Our dear heavenly Father," "Father," "Father God," or some other form of reference to God as Father.     What is the significance of this?     It would seem that the instructions of our Lord in giving the model prayer, "The Lord's Prayer," is emulated by our propensity for addressing God as Father.     Since Jesus said, "When you pray, say, 'Our Father,'" that form of address has become the virtual standard form of Christian prayer.    Because this form of prayer is used so frequently, we often take for granted its astonishing significance.     The German scholar Joachim Jeremias has argued that in almost every prayer that Jesus utters in the New Testament, He addresses God as Father.     Jeremias notes that this represents a radical departure from Jewish custom and tradition. Though Jewish people were given a lengthy number of appropriate titles for God in personal prayer, significantly absent from the approved list was the title "Father."     God has only one child, His only-begotten Son, the monogens, which restricts this filial relationship to Christ.     We do not have the natural right to call God "Father."     That right is bestowed upon us only through God's gracious work of adoption. This is an extraordinary privilege, that those who are in Christ now have the right to address God in such a personal, intimate, filial term as "Father."     Therefore, we ought never to take for granted this unspeakable privilege bestowed upon us by God's grace.     We note in the Lord's Prayer that Jesus instructs us that now when we pray, we are to refer to God as "Our Father."     Again the "our-ness" of this relationship is grounded in the unique ministry of Jesus by which, through adoption, He is our elder brother and He gives to us those privileges that by nature belong only to Him.     Now, by adopting us, He says that we may regard God, not only as His Father, but as our Father.    The first petition of the Lord's Prayer is found in the words, "Hallowed be Thy Name." The opening address, "Our Father, who art in Heaven," is simply that, an address.     From that address, Jesus instructs His disciples to offer certain petitions in prayer.     The first and chief of those petitions is that we pray that the name of God will be hallowed.     This is also extraordinary in that as the prayer continues, we ask that the will of God be done on earth as it is in heaven and that His kingdom would come on earth as it is in heaven.     Both of these desires can only be met when and if the God of the kingdom of heaven and of earth is treated with supreme reverence, honor, and adoration.     When we fail to observe the third commandment, when we fail to honor God as God, and use His name as a curse word, or in a flippant, careless manner, we fail to fulfill this first petition.     Perhaps nothing is more commonplace in our culture than the expression that comes from people's lips on many occasions, when they say simply, "Oh, my God!"     This careless reference to God indicates how far removed our culture is from fulfilling the petition of the Lord's Prayer.     It should be a priority for the church and for every individual Christian to make sure that the way in which we speak of God is a way that communicates respect, awe, adoration, and reverence.     How we use the name of God reveals more clearly than any creed we ever confess our deepest attitudes towards the God of the sacred name        God bless all who seek Him sincerely|`|G7UaCBDyaa	about three months ago when a certain person stood next to me...my heart was in my mouth and i could barely breath everytime they looked or smiled at me...
PLhk3dbraa	Social work is a profession for those with a strong desire to help improve peoples lives. Social workers assist people by helping them cope with issues in their everyday lives, deal with their relationships, and solve personal and family problems. Some social workers help clients who face a disability or a life-threatening disease or a social problem, such as inadequate housing, unemployment, or substance abuse. Social workers also assist families that have serious domestic conflicts, sometimes involving child or spousal abuse. Some social workers conduct research, advocate for improved services, engage in systems design or are involved in planning or policy development. Many social workers specialize in serving a particular population or working in a specific setting.i.e children/families, mental health, disabilities or older people/ adults.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I didn't know he was Korean either.     I think that the prejudice instead got directed against people with mental illness.  What upset me is that laws were passed against people with mental illnesses because of him. It wasn't his mental illness that made him violent - mental illnesses do not correlate with violence (except that you are more likely to be a VICTIM of violence if you have a mental illness) Because of people like him, I fear losing my gun rights, and I am a kind, non violent person with bipolar disorder who likes to go deer hunting, and our family food budget depends on that low-cost meat. I also need to kill woodchucks and rabbits that eat up our garden. I am extremely rural. Just because that guy hated the world, doesn't mean a middle aged woman should lose her right to own a rifle, but in several states I have lost that right due to people like Seung-Hui Cho.     The only person I have ever met that was anti-asian at all was a woman who was still angry at the Japanese for bombing Pearl Harbor, and her husband had to go to war while she had a tiny baby at home.  I think most people perceive asian peoples as very hard working and polite.  I know when I was getting my math degree, there was some resentment of how hard kids from some asian countries would work at their homework, so kids with ordinary work habits (read that - like to party a lot) felt they couldn't compete.  I've been out of college like 20 years now, so I don't know if american students still feel that way.    I have met many people who are anti-black or anti-Mexican though.  Many.  I just don't think there are enough asian people around for people to work up an unreasonable hatred of them.  I seem to recall when I lived in Los Angeles and the riots over the cops getting off beating up Rodney King - that black people targeted Korean immigrant merchants whom they felt were exploiting black people in poor neighborhoods.  (I notice the only people who ran amock were young men, though, and there were hispanics as well). So I think in some black neighborhoods, Koreans are not liked.    Anyway, hope some of that gives you insight.  I liked my korean students when I was a TA at a major university - they actually showed up to my office hours!|`|AA11658197	Perhaps in that town or that area the anti-Korean sentiment has increased but farther out I doubt there was any noticeable change.

"When you secretly kiss a wondrous love or joy that may be flying far from you, you live at the glowing dawn of eternal immensity".    Have a laugh. Good luck.|`|AA10695866	Its all in your head...
1Z13L9h2aa	Hey asker! :) Dont worry much.    First of all, do understand you are not alone and the symptoms you   experience when you get mad are very common.  Many people share your   same reaction to the emotion of anger, i.e. weakness and shaking or   shivering.    One of the first things that happens when you experience the feeling   of anger is that your brain stimulates the adrenal glands, which sit on   top of your kidneys, to release adrenaline.  That in turn signals the   body to release fatty sugars, increasing your blood sugar ? all this   to make energy available to the body.  This is the classic ?fight or   flight? response to stress, and anger is one trigger of this type of   response, along with fear or a perception of danger.  Ever been   startled, and then surprised to find yourself weak and shaky a few   moments later?  That?s another example of this type of this same type   of physical response.  In the case of anger, it?s just stronger.  But   what happens when you don?t actually have to flee or fight is that the   blood sugar that rose so rapidly falls just as fast, and that, combined   with the leftover, unused adrenaline in your system, is what causes   the shakes and weakness.  The more angry you are and/or the longer you   stay angry, the more pronounced the reaction will be.    **************************************...    Here are links to some general information about it:    ?The physiology of anger is the same as it is for several other   emotions;  a state of heightened arousal of the nervous system causes   a rush of adrenalin that increases the heart rate and makes blood   vessels contract.  This results in such physical reactions as dry   mouth, pounding heart, dizziness, feeling faint, shaking, cold hands,   red face, headaches, stomachaches, fatigue, crying, or simply feeling   a tremendous need to release bottled-up energy in some way.  ?  http://dynamicbalance.homestead.com/Tool...    ?During an outburst of anger, heart rate goes up to 180 beats per   minute or even higher compared to the regular heart rate averaging   about 80. The blood pressure too goes up, 220 to 130 or even higher,   compared to normal readings of 120 to 80. Other harmful physical and   chemical changes take place. Body uses up sugar extremely fast   creating a sugar deficiency. As a result an angry person shakes in   anger.? http://www.mindpub.com/art083.    Here?s a good article on the physiology of stress (including anger):   http://www.dstress.com/stress.phys.      **************************************...    Here are a few other, more scientific, explanations of what?s going on   with your body that are having the effect of making you weak and shaky   when you?re mad:    This fascinating account of an experiment on determinants of emotion   with young college-age men also talks about the effects of adrenaline   causing shakes.  ?...subjects were given an adrenaline injection and   warned of the ?side effects? of the drug (hand shake, heart pounding,   dry mouth, etc.)...? http://www.holah.karoo.net/schachterstud...    This site is promoting a certain type of medical treatment, but it   does have some good information.  After giving a very thorough   explanation of the steps involved in the ?fight or flight? response,   it goes on to say that ?This paragraph is the most important in this   article...so pay attention: If during these stressful events, the   Emotional Brain or Limbic System is involved (we feel fear, anger,   resentment, etc.), it then sends a message to the Brain Stem to   maintain the Stress Response ....?  http://www.placeforhealing.com/nsawork.h...    If you want to get even more technical about it, many studies say that   the adrenal glands actually release ?noradrenaline? (also called ?  norepinephrine?) in response to anger, and ?adrenaline? (also called ?  epinephrine?) in response to fear.  Their action on the body is   somewhat different.  Here?s a chart comparing the physical responses   of each:  http://www.mds.qmw.ac.uk/biomed/kb/resou...    More information here:  http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultrane...   here:  http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/database/bi...  html ,    **************************************...    Of course, anger is a normal human emotion, and nothing will stop you   from experiencing it altogether, but seeing that this response   distresses you, you might like to know that many people have, through   some sort of anger management training, learned to control their   reactions to anger, including physical reactions.  It?s not as easy as   just willing yourself not to feel angry, but with the right knowledge,   techniques and determination, it IS possible to actually reduce the   frequency of your anger, as well as it?s ne|`|RjpGomsyaa	I do just the same & also when upset although I have never found out why|`|fkQUCwUhaa	its normal,  i do it to when i lose it, its the adrenalin.|`|fusIwst4aa	I shake a lot , too, but usually it's just because i want to punch a certain person in the face,, :)  lol,  XO,Skullprincess|`|8TVD0koDaa	its the adrenalin rush u get.|`|0jlG2clBaa	yea,i do that too..and feel the tremendous urge to smash something|`|AA11288692	I laugh.

I decided to change my approach, and I am now focusing on what I love to do, what I am good at, and I am figuring out a way that I can make money from this. I feel my lack of success is the Universe nudging me to finally explore my passions. If you do what you love, you will prosper. My ideas are coalescing, and I am on my way to working for myself.     I am a big believer in creating my own reality/manifestation/energy work. When I felt I was at my lowest point, I realized that I had given my power away and wasn't utilizing the resources I have been given.     You have the power to manifest and create. Be creative....

When asking for the job or interviewing it can show if you're depressed so give yourself or have someone else give you a pep talk before going. Ask people that you meet if they know of any where hiring. I hope it works out and you find a job. Don't give up!|`|9c7a3bd67fbfe6f08d3a5f7e9144b19caa	I'm not in this situation, but any one of us could be at any time given the circumstances lately. I really do hope you find a job soon.

4wXEtk8gaa	the fact that you are wrestling with Sarah means you wrestle with her in your mind. There are so many factors which seem to influence your ability to be with her. How else could all that conflict and confusion manifest its self other than by a close contact control sport.  the dream is telling you to find a position with her and and try it. perhaps she will get the best of you or you her, but you need to attempt and see what happens.,afterall there was a kiss.|`|AA11962654	The wrestling is a way to have bodily contact is a safe way. wrestling gives you the persmission to lay on grab and have all the toughing you want without it being an expression of how you feel. Also the wrestling could just be that the two of you wrestle with how you can be together and both of you happy.  And of course the kiss is just the manifestation of how you feel about her.|`|qkOkKVkOaa	you love her right? well in this dream you show that there is some problems in both of ur lives that u cant control its just u still love each other that at the end teh only thing that matters is that u 2 r together and everythings resolved.

To dream that you are wrestling signifies that your are grappling with a problem in your personal or professional life. You are dealing  with ideas and habits that need to be brought back into control. To dream of a kiss, denotes love, affection, tranquility, harmony, and contentment.    I think this is a pretty straightforward dream expressing your feelings about trying to work out your relationship (sometimes she has the upper hand and sometimes you do) and your feelings of affection towards her.|`|K5yWLudIaa	first of alls pals, you donts need to includes every detailsed like about wrestlings moves and what nots, thats besides the point and annoyings to read. and secondly, the dreams means that you have some buried issues with a family pet growing up.  Im thinking maybe a reptile of some kind or rodent you had as a child.. You need to let that pet go, they are in a betters placed now, and once you have let it go, you will be freed.    and by the way pal.. you did more than rant.. so dont say you "dont want to rant" because you were just a rantin foolsed|`|U66CDN2Taa	There's not a great deal to interpret here as the actions of your dreams indicate some fairly clear and open emotions about how you feel about your friend.    There is some sexual tension involved in the physical contact you describe in the dream, and this is coupled with the metaphor of you wrestling with her. The wrestling indicates that you do not know whether Sarah reciprocates your feelings towards her, and by the sound of things you have had inconclusive experiences that have left you feeling insecure about it. The other people in the room represent those who have some peripheral knowledge of your relationship.|`|qeJKa3TOaa	Here is my take:  The wrestling is something very familiar to you and you are obviously very involved in it.  So you are associating the wrestling with Close Intimacy.  It is obvious you want to get back with her on some level, but your description leads me to believe you want to have a serious relationship this time around.    Your friends in the wrestling dream don't notice you and you don't notice them says that you don't really care what others think.  Its all about you and her.    Remember your better off starting out as close friends then taking it up a notch.  If you take her out again and try to ram your tongue down her esophagus right away, she'll bolt...regardless of how much she's into you.    Finally you kissed....that is a sign that you really desire her.  But be careful, don't be too over zealous.  Play it slowly and be cool and smooth like soft serve Ice Cream.  Just let it happen, don't force things.|`|BWQ8EMzEaa	www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary|`|a5c0fefc19fa6c84053d58f21fa14d8eaa	Okay, that is way to long for me to read.  but if you search (google) dream interpretations there are a bunch of sites that you can use.  dreamdictionary.com is the one i use.  here is what you do:  there will be a list of key words  click on a word that was a big part of your dream  it will tell you what that one thing means, you can do it for all the key points in your dream.  example: you had a dream about killing a spider  you would click kill or murder  and spider  both would have significance to what they mean : )  good luck!|`|E5KNhDKwaa	your gonna eat worms ,real soon.the dream says so.
vAdtlZDpaa	To see Santa Claus in your dream indicates that you need to be more giving, accepting, and/or forgiving. You need to acknowledge and tend to some aspect of yourself.     To dream of clothes is symbolic of your public self and how you are perceived. It is indicative of the act you put on in front of others. Clothes are also an indication of your condition and status in life.  Thus clothes that are not suitable suggest putting up a front and trying to deceive others. It may be a symbol of hypocrisy and being someone that you are not.    To dream of changing clothes represents the need for change and your need to fit into a new situation or role. You need to establish a new self-image.     To see a long beard in your dream is representative of insight and wisdom.      I think this dream is a message from your subconscious telling you that you need to change the way that you relate to others and image that you portray publicly, and to be be kinder and more forgiving.|`|PRCfCSDxaa	Santa Claus    To dream of Santa Claus is a warning that you will reap what you have sown.

Common dream scenarios include having your teeth crumble in your hands, fall out one by one with just a light tap, grow crooked or rot. Such dreams are not only horrifying and shocking, but often leaves the dreamer with a lasting image of the dream. So what does it mean?    One theory is that dreams about your teeth reflect your anxiety about your appearance and how others perceive you. Sadly, we live in a world where good looks are valued highly and your teeth play an important role in conveying that image. Teeth are used in the game of flirtations, whether it be a dazzling and gleaming smile or affectionate necking. These dreams may stem from a fear of your sexual impotence or the consequences of getting old. Teeth are an important feature of our attractiveness and presentation to others. Everybody worries about how they appear to others. Caring about our appearance is natural and healthy.    Another rationalization for these falling teeth dream may be rooted in your fear of being embarrassed or making a fool of yourself in some specific situation. These dreams are an over-exaggeration of your worries and anxiety.?    Teeth are used to bite, tear, chew and gnaw. In this regard, teeth represent power. And the loss of teeth in your dream may be from a sense of powerlessness. Are you lacking power in some current situation? Perhaps you are having difficulties expressing yourself or getting your point across. You feel frustrated when your voice is not being heard. You may be experiencing feelings of inferiority and a lack of self-confidence in some situation or relationship in your life. This dream is an indication that you need to be more assertive and believe in the value of your own opinion.    In the latest research, it has been shown that women in menopause have frequent dreams about teeth. This may be related to getting older and/or feeling unattractive and less feminine.    Traditionally, it was thought that dreaming that you did not have teeth, represent malnutrition which may be applicable to some dreamers.    Other Perspectives    A scriptural interpretation for bad or falling teeth indicate that you are putting your faith, trust, and beliefs in what man thinks rather than in the word of God. The bible says that God speaks once, yea twice in a dream or a vision in order to hide pride from us, to keep us back from the pit, to open our ears (spiritually) and to instruct and correct us.    In the Greek culture, when you dream about loose, rotten, or missing teeth, it indicates that a family member or close friend is very sick or even near death.    According to the Chinese, there is a saying that your teeth will fall out if your are telling lies.    It has also been said that if you dream of your teeth falling out, then it symbolizes money. This is based on the old tooth fairy story. If you lose a tooth and leave it under the pillow, a tooth fairy would bring you money.|`|bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	i get this one A LOT! i looked it up in various dream interpretation books,it apparently means something in ur life feels out of control.a lot of people dream this one before big tests,like the s.a.t's,for example. there may be a physical cause,tho.i have t.m j,and i grind my teeth at night.i bet tooth-grinders and people who clench theyre jaws at night receive this dream as a subconcious warning-after years of tooth grinding,without using a mouth gaurd,ur teeth CAN loosen.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	Insecurity!|`|q9t321ttaa	I had a dream that all my top teeth fell out a couple days ago.

To dream of a Secret;  Mysterious. Hidden. Ready to reveal yourself or to uncover the truth.

But I look like my dad, and I mom has shown me pictures of her with me when I was born, so I realize this blonde hair is just some weird mutation.       Ask your mom if she can show you pictures of you and her in the hospital when you were born.  If she can't. don't give up!!!!        You're getting older, they'll realize, so if you keep pushing a little each day, and you aren't a blood family member, they'll eventually tell you.  (It will probably end up being nothing at all.  Did your dad really have an affair with Kim?  Even if he did, just remember, that whether or not your mom gave birth to you, or Kim, you are still loved very much.)

There are a few sayings about dreams:  -it tells the future(old belief)  -it is about worries(due to)  -it shows ones internal fear/worries  -it is totally opposite    so you see, it may not mean anything at all since there are too many interpretations.  If u really believe something about it:  the present is more important than the past, right? no need to be upset! your mom is your mom!!!
7CXVSa23aa	of course a relationship will work out well if things are balanced because relationships are a "two-way street". i believe that if the principle of give and take is applied, there would be fairness so there would be less conflict in your relationship.    it takes two people to build a relationship, so both partners must act. both of them must be involved in things, such as decision-making, so no one is inferior/superior to the other.    this could be achieved by compromising. or taking turns. or by respecting each other and meeting half-way so you could agree on things. i think this is what they call balance. :D|`|9c7a3bd67fbfe6f08d3a5f7e9144b19caa	I guess it's a good thing if things are balanced, but then it could become routine, mundane, uneventful.

Like the girl understand if the guy have to do something important for his job/family/friends and vice versa. In these type of relationship when two people to cut some slack and space for each other then it's balance.   It would be out of balance when the girl demand the guy to be with her everyday or she will get mad..... That's completely out of balance and it will ruin a relationship.  Caring and involvement might or might not get reduced if you're in a balance relationship because you know the other person is trying to understand you, so you would love him/her more. Just my thought, there are other legitimate reason|`|i77cV7Q0aa	yes in any relation u shoud use your mind first then your heart  unless u will scru up

vKFneEuIaa	I have been reading Ayn Rand for years and always find her fascinating. She is so incredibly consistent in her viewpoint. And while much of what she believes can be dismissed as unrealistic, her work does offer very precise analysis. Most people are unable to live up to her superhuman ideals, but the idea of positive and honest values is refreshing. Someone who champions freedom of speech, property rights, individualism, work ethic, etc is worth reading. If only to remind us of the values that made the US great.            Ayn Rand would not support the current stimulus package. She was an advocate of laissez faire capitalism. Gold Standard. There were no social programs or regulation in an Ayn Rand universe. Chrysler would have collapsed 30 years ago...lol.         Read the essay Egalitarianism and Inflation in Ayn Rand's  Philosophy Who Needs It. You'll probably find it interesting.|`|AA10719402	I'm assuming you are referring to the Fountainhead?    I think it's time I head on down to the library and finally check that book out.

Declines in consumption are plain, including a drop of greater than 5% over the last quarter of 2008.  This indicates a shrinking economy worse than has been seen in over 20 years.    Much of the current crisis has been laid at the feet of the private sector.  Borrowers and lenders alike are charged with having issued and accepted loans that were too risky.  Once the road got bumpy, the foreclosures commenced.  This would not have been so bad, save for the fact that the collatera for these loans was also found lacking, thus putting lenders on shaky footing themselves.    Others would argue that the reason why these private sector issues have had such a painful effect is that government borrowing and spending have resulted in a commitment of too much American wealth to projects other than those that would serve the present-day economy.  These people would indicate that people are naturally harmed by being forced to dedicate such a large percentage of their wealth to pay for government projects of questionable necessity and government debts that should never have been allowed to accumulate in the first place.  But for these obligations, the private sector would find itself more robust and better able to withstand the crashing waves of recessions.    Nobody has found the cure for the business cycle.  The economist, John Maynard Keynes, thought government spending could defeat it in the 1930s, and the combination of New Deal spending and World War II produced some evidence to suggest he was right.  However, this belief would not last indefinitely, as in the 1970s, government spending increases did not alleviate a faltering economy.  Government spending only served to cause inflation, leaving the private sector with an ailing economy and a larger national debt - double the pain.  Next, attempts were made to mitigate the effects of the business cycle by influencing interest rates and, insodoing, regulating the flow of money out in the economy.  This was believed by many to be our best bet, until such time as reducing interest rates as far as they would go still proved insufficient to jumpstart the private sector.  Now we're back at the Keynesian approach with the proposd stimulus package.    In the end, the business cycle will continue to be a blessing and a curse for free market economies.  Market economies generate superior production than command economies and grow at a much greater clip.  However, they are not risk free, and people must be on their guard when entering into purchases.  It is not always clear that the economy will remain strong, so obligations must be taken on with care.      In either event, Rand would argue that it is a disservice to people in the private sector for the government to suggest that entrusting our money to it is the best way to guarantee the long-run security of our economy.  Government attempts to do so in the past have proven partially successful at best, and we are still paying the price for what has amounted to tempoarary fixes of recessions past.  In the end, with or without this stimulus package, the economy will recover, and while it may recover more quickly with the stimulus package, the price tag of $1 trillion per year added to our national debt places a heavy burden on generations to come.  If you think the private sector looked weak kn the face of a recession this time, imagine how it will look as the commitment to the national debt grows larger still.
0ulKsvXlaa	A vent is a good thing sometimes.     This seems like more than that though, to me it's more like a cry for help. I believe you need a degree of good advice, and not to be told where you're going wrong, 'cos you're not !  To hate yourself is a bit rash and I believe there's more to it than that.  I guess somebody has mentioned you wearing the same clothes.  That's pretty embarrasing, 'cos it shows others the financial problems of your own family. You can't do anything about these financial problems, so do something about your lack of clothing choice.     Leave a delicately worded note for your mum.   Explain that you understand the money situation, but also write that others have remarked about you always wearing  the same old clothes.  Say that you don't need "new" stuff, there must be "second hand" or "charity" shops nearby where you can get "new looking" clothes for a few cents.  You parents would be pleasantly surprised at how mature you are by writing such a note, I assure you, they will be very proud of you.   I'm sure your parents would be delighted to buy you more clothes, they will find the money somehow, because they will see how important it is to you.   Go shopping with your mum and pick wisely for "trendy looking" gear.   Nobody else needs to know that these are not new.  Now about school.  I don't remember thinking many good things about school.  A very old teacher took me to one side and spoke to me about this. He noticed how I wasn't doing so well at my studies. He also knew my family didn't have much money.  He told me that it was normal to hate school, that he did when he was young. "So continue to hate it. Only one difference, hating school does not mean you shouldn't try hard to learn. Because how are you going to get out of this poor way of life that you see that your parents live, if you don't give yourself the best start for the future. Not trying your best will only hurt just you" He told me.  His gentle words changed me completely. I found that I studied much harder, I felt I had more incentive, I had a reason, a goal.  When, two years later I passed all my exams I felt a self-satisfaction that I'd never had before. It was the first time in my life that I truely liked myself.  You need a similar incentive for living, we all need this.  Perhaps your parents, because their money problems overwhelm everything else, have unwittingly neglected this problem. This is understandable, adults don't always have things easy, or have everything under control.  You're going through a lot of changes, none of which are easy.   Take life as it comes, but give everything your best shot.  Bye|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Be a man - suck it up. It'll get better. Dude you need to try and see the good things.

BEe6jwNXaa	Yeah, that would be a terrible thing to do.  Unemployment will spike.  Businesses will raise prices to cover the added costs thus increasing inflation.

I daringly did a lot of things without much reflection, and I regret painfully a lot upon thinking of them.    But then I think that my present life, my own existence and perhaps the existence and presence of those that I love and who love me, and whatever good achievements, are the result of all that past behaviour,     and thus the things that I did, even those that objectively are so much regrettable, are deserving of utmost respect, of respectful silence, even those things that will give shameful memories and that I am afraid will nag me for the rest of my life, and that in moments of weakness or crisis might even affect me much severely, perhaps driving me mad.    I hope that I will always be strong so that I may not become ill because of so many regrets    and I hope to become ever more conscious and more able to do things that will not evoke feelings of regret.    I hope to ever be able to ardently optimistically declare "from now on ..." and so to diligently brilliantly purposefully ever try and "from now on" build up more glowing proud memories for a future.|`|6GmtcZteaa	yes because im a peace of sh*t  i did many bad things that i KNEW i shouldnt do  in the process of making up though|`|dBkEqT2naa	No.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	Yes and I do.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Yes =/   I regret it a lot|`|wUodHpEuaa	how many hours can you spare cuz this could take a while...
dSZNvizXaa	Considering you said it was a guy you used to like, I assume that means you are over him? or have moved on? anyways I am guessing that it means you have moved on, you are ok with letting him live his life, but are not hostile towards him. You still assisted him when the time called for it, but were okay with the fact that he was married.

vzVLGOezaa	Hi friend,  Its not necessary to master Psychology to work better or get motivated.Psychology is to understand feelings and behaviour.

You may be thinking that you are doing your part to support the family unit, but others are not.    You want everyone to contribute as much as they can, rather than opting to overly rely on outside entities to provide for the family's basic needs and wants.
vAdtlZDpaa	To dream that you are holding hands with someone represents your connection with that person. Walking indicates making slow steady progress towards a goal. A school in your dream indicates learning. I didn't find a meaning for bus stop, but to dream that you are at the bus station suggests that you have reached some new level or stage in your emotional or physical life.      A party is symbolic of enjoying life, especially social life. Your teacher represents wisdom.

dDcX1NNOaa	It's hard not to care what your parents think of you. A lot harder than a friend or a stranger. Anyone that would write an unwarranted antagonistic letter as you've described wants the conflict and the drama, badly. Addressing these things which were written in the letter would give the writer what they want. Do not give them what they want. Believe it or not, ignoring what was written is a strong rebuttal. It sends the message that you don't care enough about what was written to bother thinking about it let alone replying. You may not see a change overnight but if you are going to encourage a reply I suggest replying with a good-natured vague email consisting of harmless comments. No questions and no reaction to any of the things written in his mother's email. Do this consistently for a good time and if she responds at all, those responses will eventually change. She will realize she cannot get the reaction she craves.|`|AA11658197	I think the short and to the point reply he sent is better because it doesn't lend itself to a long drawn out argument about each of the points outlined in her initial letter. It's rarely about the issues and more about the attached emotions.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Let it go and move on. Any parent that would be that mean to their own child is distrubed and not mentally able to carry on a logical conversation. For this reason, nothing good will become of any further dialogue.    Seriously, parents that screwed up are not going to 'see the light'. Nothing he says will get through. A shame that his parents are absolute nuts, but best to face it for what it is, not try and 'fix' a helpless situation.    "You can't win an argument with a crazy man."|`|9c7a3bd67fbfe6f08d3a5f7e9144b19caa	It's his personal choice. Will all of the emotions he feels keep festering up inside if he chooses to ignore the e-mail? Maybe it will make him feel better knowing that he addressed the inconsistencies. If it were me, I'd probably reply, I wouldn't be able to just ignore it; however, I'm not in his shoes. I don't know how long this has been going on, what the disagreement is about, etc.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	People like her want him to reply. That is why she has been so outrageous...she cant bear to be ignored and will do anything to get his attention. Just ignore her and be happy. Stewing on things and being upset only hurts you...she is beyond that and will always find a way to justify things. Your husbands best revenge is to ignore her completely and be happy. Although expect the next email to say she has cancer and only weeks to live or something. People like that love drama. Just let it go and live your lives...she isn't worth all the aggravation.|`|0JP5ZnXIaa	I think it would be better to just let go and move on because if he responds the e-mails will continue to go back and forth. If your husband does reply it will get his mom more upset and a new e-mail will be created. Well I'm sure you get were I'm going with this. Good luck! I hope you guys can move on.|`|41Dwgx0Caa	My mum did the same thing to me a few years back.  I never replied to her last email as she really wanted to stick the knife in and instead have just kept it in my documents in case she ever tries to reconcile.  She was blocked from sending me emails afterwards and then I changed my email addy too.    I never read it as I don't want to be reminded of the hurt, but I keep it for the possible day where she may want contact again, I will read the email and it will remind me that we will never get along and how much she has hurt me.  Sympathies for your husband, some people should just not become parents you know?|`|puJxykXeaa	u have to first know who is wrong between you n them.then take a decision....and offcourse talking makes things better so just relax and have a chat and get things sellteled

BhumxInEaa	(1) If interest rates to commercial lenders were 8-10% no one would want to borrow. Already, the difference between the rates that the banks pay for their money and the rates the banks get for the loans they do make is unusually high.    (2) You are mixing up several interest rates. The Federal Reserve interest rate is the rate at which the Federal Reserve will loan money to banks. There is a related interest rate, which the Fed influences but does not control directly , which is the rate banks lend to each other.    The Fed has been keeping its interest rates (the rates that banks pay for the money they lend) low so that banks can lend to companies at rates the companies can afford while still making profits for the bank.    So, with respect to supply and demand, the Fed wants the banks to demand more from the Fed so they can loan out more money to their own customers. The banks don't seem to want to lend money to their own customers even though it shouldn't cost the banks. One reason might be that even if the banks p[ay a very low rate for their money, if their customers don't pay the loans back, the bank loses, and, as a result, banks are just afraid of lending.    (Recall that there are many situations in economics where the rational behavior for the individual is not good for society as a whole. The "Tragedy of the Commons"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_...  and the free rider problem are only two simple examples:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_...  but here we have a situation where what the banks see as being in their own best interest is not seen as being in the best interest of society. Given the decline in the economy and so many companies already going bankrupt, the banks have some reason to fear.)    (3) There are only a limited number of things a foreign entity can do with their long-term Treasuries:    A) They can just hold them for the interest they pay - currently quite low.    B) They can hold them as a repository of value - because they feel the risk of their value dropping is not too high.    C) They can use them to buy American goods or to make investments in American property.    D) They can sell them to someone else who wants to do A - D.    No one really wants to hold too much cash. That is very inefficient. (Even when it comes to "foreign reserves" there is an economic theory on the optimal level of reserves) So most debt eventually goes to C. Right now, however:    I. The Chinese and Japanese government do seem to be holding a great deal of U.S. Treasuries rather than using them.    The good news is that if they were to try to sell them, the dollar would drop so fast that it would make things much worse of the U.S. economy.    (The bad news is that if they hadn't held them, then the bubble would have burst sooner and not have been as bad.)    II. Having them buy Treasuries and hold them is still better than not having them buy the treasuries at all, especially when we have to go into debt for any stimulus package.    (Note that even the Republicans now claim we need a stimulus package. They just want it to be in the form of tax cuts rather than investment. But either way, the U.S. goes further into debt. Now wether they believe what they are saying is another matter.)    If we were to try selling Treasuries and no one would buy, that also would make the dollar worth much less very quickly.    All of this isn't to say that what the Fed is doing is right - there are a few knowledgeable people who disagree. But it is to say that there is a logic behind their position, and most knowledgeable people agree it is the most reasonable thing to try.
mU2eMSi3aa	Hopefully not.  It takes people like you who get involved and let people know that something isn't right.  Keep it up and don't be discouraged, some people just don't wanna hear it so they stick their heads in the sand.|`|fUdBPu01aa	This unequal pay issue is a myth. How many men take years off from their careers and delay education and training to have kids? Very few. However, this is the norm with women. It's called maternity leave.    Pay should be based on performance, not gender, race or any other issue.|`|TYW2OQM5aa	You'll always be able to find or shown an example of some kind of discrimination that still exist, but on the whole, I say the answer is NO.     It is also true that sometimes someone that doesn't have as much education or experience really is better for the job. We can't always promote on the basis of whose been there the longest. If we did that then John McCain should be President. A lot of people sure weren't using longevity as the only credential when they voted for the President of the United States. Why can't a person running a company have that same freedom to chose whom they want? It's their business. Literally. If they make bad choices their business will fail and they ultimately will pay the price.     But we're moving towards Socialism so that Capitalist ideal is on it's death bed.

However, the dreams that we have while asleep are controlled at the level of the subconscious, and therefore are communications in symbols - not to be taken literally (normally).|`|bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	i once had a long,vivid dream in which i married one of my coworkers.he was a silly,goofy guy i could'nt stand,so i called my mom and i told my room-mate about the dream,and we all laughed-a LOT!11 years later,(long after we both worked elsewhere)i ran into him while shopping,and we had a nice conversation and went for coffee.well,that was almost 4 years ago.u probably guessed-yes,he's my husband.so i guess i have to say,sometimes a dream isnt just a dream-maybe it is sometimes,a hint of our future!|`|ZuEfo9Sbaa	Yes, I pay close attention to my dreams.  This may sound stupid but things seem to occur in things that happen in my dreams, but extremely loosely.  Like if my best friend DIES in my dream, then the next day I lose my best friend.  I experience deja vu ALOT.    But, that's just me.|`|4wXEtk8gaa	Of course, dream states can be noted by sleep doctors. most dreams occur in the deepest sleep. all day we live and think and freak out.This occurs in our conscious state. We need to give our brains a break, so we go to sleep and when we get to the deepest level our subconscious takes over and we dream. Mostly to work out the issues of the day or we would walk around as basket cases with all that we deal with.
anF78HOxaa	The human mind is probably one of the most powerful things on our planet today. Because if you think about it, a human is an animal, just like a tiger or bear but we humans have expanded ourselves and developed such a culture where we have a written language that every one of our species can read and understand no matter what part of the world they're in and a way to trade/ communicate with others of our kind no matter what distance with a simple pressing of a few numbers [by telephone]. No other animal species has expanded taht much, even while some have been around much longer than the humans have. Everything that you see developed today, computers, TV's, and even calculators; a human made it and had to format it to so it can do the functions they do. No other species has been able to produce what the human mind has produced, from the satellites floating in outer space, to a simple sheet of paper. <br>  <br>  Also the human mind can do what it wants and it is still expanding over the world. <br>  It is the human mind that controls the feelings of a person, that ables to you get excited, sad, upset, happy, or anything else and it is the human mind that controls your body. Without it, we'd be nothing. When people are suicidal its because of the human mind, when people are happy, it is because of the human mind. <br>  <br>  I hope that helped to answer your question. |`|1V3eQRu5aa	Everything.<br>  Nothing.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's a speck in the universe.<br>  <br>  <br>  And the make or break of our planet.<br>  <br>  And something that will never occur to so many things.<br>  <br>  But something that has the power do attempt and consider anything.|`|w29tsXLUaa	Very powerful. It can control. It can destroy. It can create. It is the very soul of human beings.|`|PKe37L24aa	very powerful.|`|LPpAdlt5aa	very powerful|`|nDcbdaMHaa	very in many ways|`|7fa0FWu2aa	Ask Jesus into your heart and find out!|`|bd47f6bac4920ef3cb452d02aefcb041aa	more powerful than any supercomputer will ever be created....and the reason is because our soul is the true source of all this power.<br>  How do we allow the flow of data between the two, is a whole different story that would take years of study.|`|dr5ElP8Faa	Very Powerful
KYyJ67CWaa	Regarding the Media:  look at the theory of "power elite" as proposed by sociologist C. Wright Mills.  He focused on the military, business and government elite but you can argue that the growth of large media organizations as multinational corporations now qualifies them as either part of the business elite or that they now constitute their own "fourth estate" of power elite capable of influencing government, social policy and even military conflicts.  In addition members of the media now become elite members of government (example:president's press secretary) thus shifting from one elite group to another.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	lying, stealing, cheating, stalking.......|`|2206b0281b88485f9098f66c3af6eff9aa	Write about the stupid Illinois Gov.

mkr5lpWDaa	Hawaii|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	California would be the 3rd or 4th biggest economy in the world if it was its own country.|`|zM7ViED2aa	According to Arnold, CA is the 8th largest economy in the WORLD.    From what I've seen of the other states, I'd have to say CA is the richest.  I just moved from SoCal less than a year ago.  There, houses would be half a million if they were 15 years old and 2000 sqft with very little land.  Many people drive cars worth over $30,000.  And when there are so many people and many of those people are amazingly rich. . .it makes for a rich state.
