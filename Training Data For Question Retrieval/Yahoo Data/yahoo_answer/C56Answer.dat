204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	I can't tell you how exhausting it is to have the same invalid points constantly resurfacing.  Have you taken American History 101 & 102 in college yet?  I am not saying this to be condescending.  It's a legit question, because these courses will cover this.  It has to be at the college level, because you just don't get the detail and understanding of it in high school that they offer in college.<br>  <br>  The period of time around the industrial revolution triggered an ideological shift in which the Republicans and Democrats essentially began to switch roles from what they once were.   I fully assure you, with no misgivings whatsoever, that if Abraham Lincoln were alive today, the man would be a Democrat.   What started out as a purely practical logistical move by the Democratic Party to (I really hope you're listening and not posting this so that you can select an answer that happens to agree with your world view because I'm tired of having my time wasted like that also) to increase the size of its base by finding a foundation to get northern unions to back its cause, which eventually translated into making it the party for the poor and working class and the rights of the common man to exist with dignity, eventually became a deep-seated, ingrained inclination to work for the least among us.  As that happened, the Republican Party emerged as the party of industrialists, something it still is to this day, and the Republican Party became united around the "strong states rights" concept.  It always did believe in those concepts but it became inextricably linked to to it in order to appeal to the south, the very same south that produced that confederate flag and tried to secede from the union.  By the time of the civil rights movement, the official position of the Democratic Party was no longer linked to its past bigotry in any way, in fact, it was Northern Democrats who were at the heart of the fight.  This was unacceptable to southerners who had always been die-hard Democrats because no southerner "votes for the party of Lincoln" and they began to drop off in droves, turn to the Republican Party and support much of the anti-working class, anti-united, anti-growth positions we hear from the Republican Party today.<br>  <br>  So in answer to the question, no, the confederate flag is a flag of a dark time in southern history of which a disturbing number of southerners are still proud.  It has no connection really to either party, though I think you'd find that for the last 50 years, most of those who fly it consider themselves Republicans or members of other right-wing parties.|`|yoPNXiluaa	Eric,<br>  Uh Democrats were the racists back in the day. In fact most civil rights opponents were Democrats.|`|rrSaoOK2aa	yes|`|igwzwx13aa	The Southern element which is so enamored with that flag, the flag of a defeated enemy of the US, left the Democratic Party in 1964.  They didn't like the way that the real Democrats were handling segregation, so they split off and became Republicans.  A couple of them tried to form a "Dixiecrat" party, but they failed.<br>  Many left before 64, but the final nail in the coffin was when Johnson passed Kennedy's Civil Rights Act.|`|PcW8H1Asaa	You do realize that the Democrat party was supported by the K.K.K. at one time ?

It's been common knowledge among British troops for at least 4 years. I suppose it's down to it taking place a few thousand miles away and sweeping the problem under the carpet.<br>  <br>  It will eventually arrive here. These "British" Muslims are training in Northern Pakistan and then returning to the UK. It doesn't take a master mind to figure out why.<br>  <br>  They are becoming more vocal and brasher in their condemnation of the UK as they gather strength. Eventually it must come to an head.

The soldiers they are fighting won't stop to check nationalities.<br>  <br>  I have read the Australian Prime Ministers speech, and he is dead on, so if not me, please give AI G the points.<br>  <br>  As for coming here, there are to many moderate muslims in the Uk to let that happen.<br>  <br>  Please remember that during the Northern Irish troubles, the VAST MAJORITY, of people there just wanted to live in peace, with all their neighbours.|`|vIhgjb9paa	To the Afghans, the British are invaders.  <br>  <br>  I have no idea why we are there.

A lot of us have been fighting terrorism since BEFORE 9/11, you don't point out if those terrorists you were fighting were Muslims or not. (For me it was the IRA)<br>  <br>  getting back on track, the Australians had a politician who made a speech in 2005, reminding Australian Muslims that Australia was a secular state, if they didn't like it they were free to leave, I think this is the angle we should take on the Muslim population in Britain. <br>  Embrace the British culture or don't benefit from it - I use the word benefit to lead me to the next point.<br>  There have been cases where Huge families of Muslim immigrants are claiming housing, unemployment and child benefit, money paid by the very non-believers they are against. Surely there is something in the Koran about accepting gifts from your enemy, or at the very least biting the hand that feeds you!|`|c0be28b3edea48ead1b1905ccac2f3b6aa	We will see a rise in terrorist attacks on our own soil. People will continue to stare at the latest reality TV sensation on their massive LCD TV's, oblivious and indifferent. And our government will think about why these attacks happened, come to the conclusion that its our fault, and probably integrate sharia law in order to appease the fanatical vocal minority of British muslims.|`|b482e332c54a999fc8b09412daabe7bdaa	In some ways its already started.<br>  <br>  July 7th bombings and not too long ago a group in Birmingham were caught whose aim was to kidnap and behead a british muslim off duty soldier.<br>  <br>  Worst thing is, this government is completely incompetent and will only make things worse for all the law abiding brits and british muslims.|`|c1w5PZISaa	Of course it will, if nothing is done about it.  In many ways, it already has.  You have already had your 9/11 and it will continue.  All of Europe is being overrun by Muslim immigrants and they are not "adapting" to European culture.  There are many riots and protests all over and pay attention to their banners and slogans in those riots and protests.  Here are some examples that I have seen:  Islam will control Europe by the sword!!!  Death to all Non-Muslims!!!  Islam will control the World!!!  I could go on and on.  Get ahold of an English version of the Koran and read it.  It specifically talks about "Spreading Islam by the Sword" and calling Christians and Jews Dogs.  I could go on and on about the Koran.  Now, here's my point....Almost all religions talk about tolerance, peace, love, etc....  Those religions tolerate other religions and people can live in peace.  Islam, on the other hand is NOT tolerant of Anything, except Islam.  Basically, the BASIS of the religion is that anyone that is not, or does not convert to Islam, will be forced to or be killed.  This is not the "extremist" values...It is the core value of their religion.  People talk about tolerating Muslims and getting along, but it is impossible to tolerate or get along with people whose base beliefs are to spread Islam by the sword and will NOT tolerate you.  Also, Muslims have been fighting the western world since WWII.  They have killed tens of thousands of innocent people.  Now, it may be one person here, 10 people there, etc..., but it adds up.  Of course most sane people do not want war, but we sadly know that sometimes we have to go to war, no matter what any anti-war person may say.  The current War on Terrorism has only just begun...It is the "Tip of the Iceberg"  on things of the future.  They will stop at nothing, unless we stop them.  Lastly, a few people reading this may say that I am crazy and I don't know what I am talking about.  I have been fighting terrorism, since BEFORE 9/11.  They don't like to target military targets.  They target the innocent.  That should speak for itself.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Yeah, better move before that happens.

I say "forced" because things have changed a lot since WWII and Viet Nam, so I don't think things would be handled now the same way they were then.  <br>  Anyway, I don't believe employment status plays into the draft at all.  They do, however, take into account age, health concerns, and marital status.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope, <br>  <br>  The US has never had conscription where every ,male had to join the military.<br>  <br>  Even during Vietnam war, less than 6% of the eligible males, were actually drafted.|`|c59a4010def6f797e0a0e7c583f93ec6aa	It would take an act of congress to active the draft, the information is pooled annually by the selective service.

5axNEp8jaa	Its a Crime in Germany, France, Austria and some other European Nations the penalty is usually a prison term.<br>  As far as I am aware it is only the denial of this alleged event that is punishable by law in these country's.Rwanda, Tasmania (Complete Genocide) Ireland, Armenia etc are all open to objective academic discussion (perhaps because they weren't jews)<br>  All Genocides are indeed worthy of the same and objective critical analysis of them. however there is a political elite with its own agenda that constitutes whats morally acceptable and its forced upon society. The point is its so ridiculous and draconian, in Germany you can be jailed for saying only 5,999,999 people died rather than 6 million. The industry behind it makes it impossible for a rational debate upon it, its a socially engineered project. Believe it and your part of the lie, don't believe it or question it and your a bigot and Nazi. They legislate against denial because they perhaps have to much too hide.|`|EGEOOZLXaa	It's not a crime to deny the Holocaust. It's actually a malady of stupidity to deny the Holocaust. There's thousands and thousands of records, pictures and people who were involved with what happened. However, there is one thing people overlook concerning the history of the Holocaust. Not only were Jews killed in the  Holocaust. Many Russians and others were killed also. It wasn't only Jews. Of course, history could be telling lies about all of it. None of us were there, so how would we know? One thing is for sure: many, many Jews were killed in the Death Camps by the Zionists and Hitler. Zionists are not Jews. They are impostors. Zionists could purchase a Jew's freedom in the Death Camp, but they didn't. They let them die. If you don't believe me, read Theodore Herzl's diary - the founding father of Israel today.<br>  <br>  It was all done to set up the Zionist State of Israel. Many real Orthodox Jews will not even move back to Israel, because they do not consider the State of Israel the real Israel. Israel was a people who traipsed through a desert - not a country who oppresses Palestinians. Before the State of Israel was set up, there were many Palestinian Christians. 400,000 I heard. Now, after the Zionist State of Israel, there is less than 80,000 and declining. Do you see something wrong with this picture? I do. I'm a Christian.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	I assume you are refering to Richard Williamson denying the Nazi's use of gas chambers!!!  A person can deny ANY such event that has ever happened!

U69AYTZIaa	They have a paycheck coming in and they do not care. In Toledo Ohio road workers were lounging around drinking coffee in their vehicles while I saw only one or two workers working on the bridge.

AA12020119	None!<br>  <br>  "Nov. 23, 1998, was a notable and optimistic day in the fight against smoking. Forty-six states settled their lawsuits against the major tobacco firms to recover smoking-related medical costs. They, along with the four states -- Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota -- that had reached earlier individual settlements would receive annual payments from the tobacco companies far into the future, including a collective $246 billion in the first 25 years.<br>  <br>  The settlement didn't dictate how the states were to spend that money. But many state leaders promised to use the bulk of it for smoking cessation and prevention to fight the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States -- diseases associated with the use of tobacco products.<br>  <br>  So 10 years after the settlement, how have the states done in following through on the promises of that auspicious November day?<br>  <br>  Very poorly, according to a report recently issued by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.<br>  <br>  The report by the campaign, which includes the American Medical Association among its members, found that with hundreds of billions of dollars collectively available each year from settlement money and tobacco tax revenue, states do not even come close to their promises for spending on smoking cessation and prevention. They don't even come close to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended levels of spending, which would be merely 15% of that money" <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/12/29/edsa1229.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/12...</a><br>  <br>  And just think how much tax there is on a pack of cigarettes and the government and states spend nothing that I know of!
PI8VfiY1aa	Yes, you are voting for delegates. The delegates vote for the party nominee. <br>  <br>  Primary elections are different between the Republican Primary and the Democratic Primary. <br>  <br>  In the Republican Primary elections, whichever candidate gets the most votes in any state wins all of the states delegates. The first candidate to win 1,191 from all of the state elections goes on to run as the Republican Nominee in the General (November) Election. <br>  <br>  In the Democratic Primary elections, the states are divided into congressional districts, and therefore the delegates are also divided. So a state could be split in such a way as to award half of its delegates to one democratic candidate, and half to another. In the Democratic Primaries, there are pledged delegates, which vote according to the outcome of their congressional district, and Super Delegates, which are VIP's to the Democratic Party that don't have to vote with the pledged delegates.The first candidate to reach 2,117 delegates goes on to run in the General Election as the Democratic Nominee.<br>  <br>  Yeah, you were probably over-complicating it. No worries.

AA10134302	First of all , in my eyes dept is dept. No matter what you call it, a deficit or national dept. It is still money that our country is in the hole. The deficit is actually worse for us as tax payers because no matter what you call it, it has to be paid somehow. This money just doesn't come out of thin air. Obama is adding 1 trillion to the dept of the working man and women in this country. The $25 bucks a pay period is not going to stimulate my personal budget ... I will be paying more than that out in raised local and property tax. As far as I am concerned it is a mistake. To me it seems just like the people who over mortgaged their homes.

Otherwise, it needs to be 'disabled'; what this means is open to interpretation.  For example, if it had no engine then it'd clearly be disabled and would just be a piece of metal on wheels as opposed to a vehicle.

According to Islamic teachings, to be obedient and to show kindness to parents has been enjoined in the Holy Quran in such a manner as to say that among the noble deeds, to obey parents, treat them respectfully and to show kindness to them is next to worshipping Almighty Allah. The Holy Quran says, "Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor." - Surah Al Isra (17:23).<br>  According to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), the parents of a certain person arehis Heaven or Hell. What this means is that if a person obeys his parents, attends to their needs and keeps them happy and comfortable, he will attain Paradise. On the other hand, if he is disrespectful and rude to them, offends them by ignoring their needs and feelings or causes them grief in any manner, his place shall be in Hell. In modern times, a trend has arisen whereby when parents come to be seen as a liability because of old age and physical weakness. They are then sent to 'old people's homes'.<br>  <br>  <br>  "a person is indeed disgraced, who does not earn Paradise by caring for his parents during the life time and old age of his/her parents".|`|N8QLKpCMaa	Bro it's production of western culture & govt, so they will have to deal with such idea, the Q is govt, later on, 1st of all why young & settled down couples/ singles can't keep their parents with them.<br>  i explain as ,<br>  in east parents/ old bring us up , spend a lot of money on our education & career , when they are old we give them shelter , food, medicine , money to spend bing a bro/sis , son/daughter etc.........<br>  <br>  it was on personal level b/c here govt doesn't do their jowellwel then how about such issues, here in east , pensions are such lower than they can't Singlegle thing such as living / eating !<br>  <br>  I believe this mutual support too,<br>  older people supported us to progress<br>  now we must support !<br>  <br>  discussing issues is not enough but resolving them one is required !<br>  1.........<br>   combine family system that famiyoungstersers take care of their elders with them separatelyely,<br>  <br>  2...........<br>  & other people must donate the welfare cells of old .<br>  <br>  3...........<br>  govt reforms , people will have to make govt realize that old ones must get their all citizen rights, there must responsibleble, durable policies, people & media can play good role in it.

gasquENMaa	Hello Nicola. As noted above, a CRB will show the conviction. Some states allow a spent charge ( one that has been discharged 5 years or more) to be removed. I live in Ohio and this state does allow that little luxury. Charges here will remain  on record for life.<br>  <br>  One thought does come to mind however that may help you. If you have just the one conviction, you might inquire about having it expunged. You didn't mention if this was a felony or misdemeanor conviction. <br>  <br>  If this was a misdemeanor, go to the Clerk of Courts in the county of the arrest/conviction and ask for a motion to expunge a misdemeanor. It is a relatively simple form to fill out. Return it with the filing fee to the Clerk's office. A court appearance is not necessary in this type of motion and you will be notified by mail.<br>  <br>  If this was a felony charge, it is a little more difficult. Expungement of felonies are state specific, meaning each state has it's own rules over what can be expunged and what cannot. Best advice for a felony would be to consult with an attorney in the jurisdiction of the arrest/conviction. He can tell you if you qualify and if you do, he can draw up your petition and submit it to the court in your behalf.<br>  <br>  PS....If you feel challenged in doing this for a misdemeanor charge, you can use an attorney just the same as for a felony.<br>  <br>  You could expect to pay anywhere from $500 to $1500 depending entirely on what the attorney feels his time is worth.<br>  <br>  Expungement takes 4 to 8 months as an average and will remove the entire file from all public inquiries. It is placed in a restricted area that only law enforcement and the courts have access to.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful|`|l2MjVVpRaa	It will be on your record till the day you die.|`|oFiGyMWraa	The conviction will stay on the police record for ever.<br>  <br>  However, under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act many convictions can become "spent". When spent you no longer have to disclose them in most circumstances. IE you can legitimately answer "no" if asked whether you have convictions.<br>  <br>  Because you were fined your conviction will be spent after 5 years from the date of the conviction. So it seems that it is spent and you will be OK not disclosing. If you were actually under 18 when convicted the time is only 2 1/2 years.<br>  <br>  However, certain jobs are exempt from the Act and can require you to disclose all convictions. The application form will make it clear if this is the case. There are also several levels of CRB check. Only the enhanced check includes details of spent convictions. Again, if you are going to be subject to this level of check they will tell you and ask you to disclose anything first.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if nurses require and enhanced CRB, but I would guess they do. The primary purpose of these checks is to ensure your suitability to work with vulnerable people. As nurses routinely have access to patients' possessions a theft conviction may be relevant.<br>  <br>  The check itself would not be done until you were actually applying for jobs. If you find out at this point that you are going to be rejected then the training will have been wasted. I would suggest that you discuss the matter with the university first to find out what the employer's policy is likely to be.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	It will turn up. As you received a fine, your sentence is considered "spent" after 5 years. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 enables some criminal convictions to become 'spent', or ignored, after a 'rehabilitation period'.<br>  <br>  A rehabilitation period is a set length of time from the date of conviction. After this period, with certain exceptions, an ex-offender is not normally obliged to mention their conviction when applying for a job or obtaining insurance, or when involved in criminal or civil proceedings.<br>  <br>  They will still find out, though.  Though you don't have to, I'd tell 'em up front, so you are clearly being honest and open.|`|zu6tMtnkaa	Yes it will show up but tell them the truth and how you rehabilitated yourself GOOD LUCK|`|8sZTc64Maa	For life I'm afaid.

cOJyoXEhaa	in my state the houses on the reservation are nicer than most in the surrounding towns, or at least most were. I worked on a few that we had to rebuild walls because the resident cut the wall out to pull a car or truck in to work on it. one cut a hole in wall across from wood stove and would pull whole trees (minus branches) through and push it in the fire place instead of cutting it to pieces. Upon graduation they received checks from the gov for completing high school and they went to college on treaty money. Of course they are unemployed here because they receive 4,500 each on per-cap from the casinos. I do not know one Native American who does not own a brand new car, I see a lot driving hummers for that fact. Ask anyone in WI, they will tell you the same thing. As for the south west, I read a article from the union paper that they were recruiting young men from the reservation because they could not find qualified welders and steamfitters else where. I know at least 20 that are steel workers that I work with almost daily. The unemployed are that because of 2 reasons there is no work or just plain lazy.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	The Indians would have resented the intrusion on *their precious culutre*<br>  <br>  Big Whoopee and hurray for the Native Americans<br>  they are their own worst enemy when it comes to <br>  spending their resources wisely<br>  they have the Casinos and also the oil rights but<br>  they did not help themselves|`|XpcXs7qMaa	Don't know who told you that American Indians have been receiving "massive soical programs", but you either heard wrong or read wrong.  Your own updated question is proof of that.  American Indians have been treated at a lower level than the African American population since the beginning.  Do you see us demanding equal rights?  Do you see us blaming the "whites" for holding us back like the black population does.  Ever been to the low income black areas?  If you have, than you know that they are Palaces compared to the homes on he reservation.   We fight our battles in the courts, not the streets, trying to get our rights and our lands back.  Government Social handouts?  Who are you trying to kid?|`|8OaAmwq8aa	The reason for this is as old as time itself, their leaders have screwed their own people.

DTSUJe2oaa	A speeding violation is a misdemeanor in Georgia and it does add points to your license but on a first offense she would not have her lecense suspended.~<br>  <br>  TRAFFIC LAWS IN GA <br>   <br>  <br>  Traffic law violations are the most common criminal offenses in Georgia. That's right, a traffic offense is a crime. Most are misdemeanors. Speeding is an example of a misdemeanor traffic charge.<br>  <br>  Others can be the basis for a felony. For example, if a death results from a traffic accident, if the surviving driver is found to be DUI, he could also be charged with a felony Homicide by Vehicle.<br>  <br>  Still others can be felonies all by themselves. For example, if you have attained the status of being an Habitual Violator and if you are caught driving a motor vehicle (or even operating one - there is a difference), you are guilty of violating the Georgia Driver's License Act and could get up to 5 years in prison.~

In his State, there is usually only one licensed plumber on a job who has several people who are plumbers in the sense they plumb for a living , that work under his license.  <br>  <br>  When Obama approached "Joe" to shake his hand, he asked Obama a "what if" sort of question regarding his dream of one day owning his own plumbing business.  <br>  <br>  Whether the Louisiana Sheriff ever said something racist or not is immaterial to the point.  The point was, he was desperately trying to save stranded people (White, Black or other) but some bureaucrat was trying to stop him.  <br>  <br>  If you keep going along with what President Obama is doing, the only new jobs will be more and more bureaucrats.<br>  <br>  That is the point and it is a very important one.  <br>  <br>  By the way, how does that particular sentence the Sheriff said, racist?  If there is crime in the Black Neighborhoods, is it not the Blacks in those Neighborhoods that the Sheriff was trying to protect from crime?  Would a Fire Chief consentrate his men where there is fire or where there is no fire?  The Sheriff was looking to catch bad guys and protect good guys.

So, if he clocks in at 12:04, you can round to 12:00, but if he clocks in at 12:07, you must round to 12:10. You are not allowed to dock time from his clock as a punishment. (For example, you can't start paying him at 12:10 if he comes in at 12:04.) However, if your clock is accurate to the twentieth of the hour, and he comes at 12:07, you can round to 12:05 (but you will also have to round 12:04 to 12:05).<br>  <br>  Because he was using seven minutes as a guideline, I suspect that your time clock was only accurate to the quarter hour. 12:07 would round to 12:00, but 12:08 would round to 12:15.

I will help you out though. One relates to a matter of Constitutional Law. The other means nothing until such a time as circumstances require that such questions be asked.  Just for the record there were questions asked and answered regarding McCain's citizenship status by both Democrats and Republicans. In case you do not understand the significance of this statement.

She was 17, unmarried in a foreign land. Now if she had been married to a guy that was an American citizen, there would have been no question, but she was unmarried and Obama's dad was NOT a citizen. That's how the laws were written then, so that would have automatically denied him U.S. citizenship.<br>  Don't believe me? look it up.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	When he runs for president, then I will want to see his birth certificate as well, although there really isnt much mystery srrounding him and his family.|`|3ixmHSwmaa	Republicans don't really care about Jindal's birth certificate because he's not running for president. If he ever does, this Republican will want to see proof. If he is a born citizen, he will prove it, unlike certain other people we know.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Edna N.<br>  You said "his complete and utter lack of intelligence" but I wonder if you knew he was accepted to both Harvard Medical School and Yale Law?  Obama couldn't have managed that, so I'm just wondering where you get your information, or if you just make it up as you go along?<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  RE Additional Information:<br>  Your first responder gave you a simple answer already. "He's not running for president."<br>  The presidency is the only federal office a naturalized citizen cannot hold, so naturally it's important to establish ones exact status if they are going to run for that office. If the Obama campaign had dealt with his proof correctly in the beginning, we wouldn't have all the speculation going on right now. <br>  <br>  Obama and Bush both sealed their school records. Bush's no doubt was over partying, but Obama may be trying to hide his enrollment documents. Maybe he received special consideration or grants because he is a citizen of Kenya? No one really knows because all he seems to be able to produce in the way of proof is that silly rag that's floating around the Internet. I don't follow the Obama citizenship story, but it's pretty obvious why many people do.<br>  <br>  Jindal is the governor of a state, and not in the federal government at all. If the Louisiana Constitution required him to be a citizen at birth, you can bet the people of that state would be interested in his status, Democrat and Republican alike.<br>  <br>  Sorry my answer wasn't simple, but your first responder's was and you seemed to have missed it. If this doesn't make sense, send me an email and I will try to explain further.|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	Sounds like a double standard to me.|`|fKFvzlzQaa	I would be willing to bet that if Jindal decides to run for President, the Republicans will demand a copy of his birth certificate and publish it all over the place.|`|AA11518835	For the same reason that Democrats think that Obama's stimulus is a good idea, and thought Bush's was a bad idea.<br>  <br>  The answer is because people in both parties see themselves as members of a team. They support the team when it does good, make excuses for them when they do bad, and blame the other team when anything goes wrong. <br>  It really is because supporters of political parties don't think for themselves. <br>  I hold this truth to be self evident:<br>  If you believe in one party 100% of the time, you have stopped thinking for yourself and decided to let a party think for you.<br>  To say the least, it is EXTREMELY unlikely that anyone with their own, well-examined beliefs would fall perfectly into either party.|`|QjdHnrZiaa	Obama's citizenship wasnt in question.

Oh, you mean the money we are spending inside our own country to get the people back to work so the country can again support itself. Obama didn't rob the country of almost a trillion dollars that we all worked for & saved during the Clinton years. It was Bush who was handed that money & did not spend it in this country but made it disappear. It was Bush who brought debt up to almost a trillion dollars. It was Bush who left our country tumbling down. Obama is not buying seeds so construction workers can get back to work & off or the government assistance. They will then get the hot dog vendors back to work so they can go to the mall to keep the clerks working & the guy who cuts their grasss cause they are so busy again. What is wrong with people who can't see the difference & think it is OK that Bush robbed us but they think it is horrible to get our own economy flowing again? So to answer your question first get clear about what you call debt. Yes, it is important for us all to support the stimulus investment in our own country. Yes, it is important to have medical care & you must be healthy now or you wouldn't ask this.|`|ELAsvwE3aa	You can call me a socialist BUT I think it is appropriate for the government of the worlds richest and most powerful nation to take care of its sick, disabled, and elderly.<br>  <br>    I hardly believe that anyone is living retirement on a beach in Hawaii off of a social security check.  <br>  <br>  Medicare, starting at age 65, is not world class healthcare either.  It is healthcare insurance that keeps your nonprofit hospitals afloat.  Without medicare, without retirement healthcare from an employer(nobody gets this anymore, including myself as a healthcare provider), how does a 65+ person pay for thier medical exspenses? They dont.  And the hospital eats the cost or sends the elderly person into bankrupcy.<br>  <br>  You may question the method in which the President approaches these subjects, but your lack of understanding the importance of these subjects is troubling.

It's no wonder that so many republicans now believe that everyone 'not them' is some kind of commie, borrowing is better than paying taxes and that the world is flat.  Even the movers and shakers of the current GOP have come to believe their own disinformation.  We're flying in a shot up B-17 and the only pilot we have is Capt. Obama and his crew.  That's it!

Feathering the props that are on fire, dumping overboard everything that can be dumped, leaning out the mixture and keeping the nose up MAY get us back to base.  Bitching and moaning won't.  The problem here is that the GOP hasn't come up with anything specific except to 'cut taxes'.  P/Obama has suggested cutting taxes for 95% of those that still have income...the republicans ignore that. If they want to have some input they better do better than that.

Congress and the House was once made up of men that would look at the good of the USA not the good of the Pork Belly Projects when we were this bad off.  It is just unbelievable that they are getting these items.  And we have the Rep who are looking at the fact that they are voting on a bill that they did not create and they will not get credit for if it does not work.  And that was just the Band aid.  There is something to be said about having a King or Queen that made all the rules without having to deal with a group of people that could stop all the things that they wanted to do.  You just have to wonder how far do we have to fall before Washington with get the picture that we are dealing with something worst then the 1920's or the 1970's.  At least in those times, we had different items help us get through.  i.e., most people were still on the farms and grow their own food.

Midbg5BJaa	Have you thought about maybe just getting a Tier 1 UK visa and moving over for a job?

Fix that and apply right away again.<br>  <br>  I do see a problem though. You were denied a tourist visa and now you are asking about an immigration visa. It may be that you had no intention on leaving with a tourist visa.

If you dont have these, then yes you will be denied approval to immigrate. <br>  <br>  so then the next time you want a visitor visa, you will be denied everytime because you already tried to immigrate and were denied which means you have already shown that you do not intend to LEAVE canada.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Skilled worker visa would be an immigrant visa.

I used them to make a "future army wife" tee for my bachelorette party, I used a black tee, on the front I used one of my (then) fiance's name badges from his ACU's and just velcro it on like it is on their uniform, on the sleeve I bought an iron on flag(like 1.00 at walmart) and ironed it on the sleeve like on the uniform, then on the back I used my letters, my (now husband) loved it, and I was getting compliments on it alllll night...heres a pic of the shirt I made..<br>  <a href="http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww267/annamhanson/bachelorette37.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww267...</a><br>  <a href="http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww267/annamhanson/bachelorette35.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww267...</a><br>  <a href="http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww267/annamhanson/bachelorette28.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww267...</a><br>  hope this helps!|`|gSGQcgeLaa	You could also customize it with an iron on patch<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.vetfriends.com/catalog/catalog_item.cfm?SortBy=patch" rel="nofollow">https://www.vetfriends.com/catalog/catal...</a><br>  <br>  or a military Pin Commemorating his service<br>  <br>  Please Please thank him for me, he is a true hero and you are great for being with him while he is away.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.vetfriends.com/catalog/catalog_item.cfm?SortBy=lapel" rel="nofollow">https://www.vetfriends.com/catalog/catal...</a>|`|HQE8Yvicaa	This shirt will be on the floor in a few hours..<br>  Because my soldier is home!<br>  <br>  haha i used to have one that said something like that when my Marine came home from iraq. true and to the point!<br>  have a good time with your hubby!!|`|Fq3J2j7vaa	There  are old Army jokes about what the first things a soldier will do upon arrival home - tht I will not repeat.<br>  <br>  The clothes are a cute idea but the most important thing for him to see is your smile and kiss and hug.<br>  <br>  Been there, done that!|`|vOaa2d1Daa	Missed you (on the front)<br>  Want you (on the back)|`|AA10223920	On the front MY HERO IS HOME!!!!!|`|014NXPfFaa	That is a cute Idea...

gYNDNXAkaa	Are you asking can a wife use the money earned by her husband?  Yeah.  Joint accounts, etc.|`|jrdtQi04aa	Yes.  You can have credit in your name alone on his income.  The credit limit will be low at first, but as you make payments, it will go up. Also, since you are a stay at home mom, and your husband wants it that way too, you dont have to be mindful that you are not spending "your" money.  The money he earns is yours too.  You are working for the family as well.  Of course, be mindful that you stay within limits of the household budget.  But this "his" money stuff is nuts.  It's the family money.|`|AA11254601	Well, yeah.  But you need to be respectful of the fact that it si't your money you are spending.  I think you and your hubby need to work out a spending arrangment for you that he can easily afford each month.  But yes, you can and I find it odd that you feel the need to even ask this question.<br>  <br>  The only thing is that you have to make sure the bills are taken care of and the kids have what they need, food dipairs, formula, ect.|`|orfmhb2waa	yes your wife can use your credit card and bank account. my wife has a job and helps out, i appreciate the help.|`|MPQCX5yhaa	It depends on her credit history and the household income.  On the credit card applications they ask for the combined household income and you can get the card solely in your name.  I'm not about the bank account, BUT if you have the money, I doubt they'll turn you away. <br>  <br>  You can also become an authorized user on your husband's accounts. BUT you can get credit cards on your own, WITH your husband's income, IF you have a responsibly established credit history. The credit limit depends on your credit history, sometimes the limit may exceed that of your husband's, who has a card with the same company ( I thought that one was weird, however sometimes they see the income as your income regardless who brings it in). I know this from experience. <br>  <br>  I would advise stay at home moms to build their credit and resumes, to be on the safe side.|`|WF4Z10Paaa	as long as it is a joint account|`|AA11206283	That's up to a married couple to work out.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	Yes, but the credit card and bank account need to have your name on them. If they have his name only, you are technically not supposed to be using them (although some stores might still accept the credit cards).<br>  <br>  Usually, all he would need to do is have his bank add your name to his account, and call up the credit card company and have them issue a second card on his account in your name.<br>  <br>  Or, if you already have a joint bank account, you can open a credit card in your name and then pay the bills from your joint account.
sYUYkrzKaa	It took  my (ex) husband 5 yrs in total to get a green card. Two yrs later he split. Stamp my forehead STUPID.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	It varies based on which USCIS Center you file with, the type of petition filed and the location of the beneficiary.|`|djwrCIGoaa	There isn't an average because green cards are obtained through family petitioners and employer petitioners and they are accomplished by processings through consulates and embassy filings in the country of the person's nationality and also from filings in the United States. Your question may gain a more informative response if you provide more specifics.
ZLLNnKgzaa	I have just checked this attached website and it looks as if your little one might be actually a british citizen.  You will need to register him as British though.  It is worth doing that for him and getting him a passport.  It says that once your son reaches the age of 18 he can then apply for naturalisation himself.  He can have dual citizenship as long as your country of origin allows it.  To register him as a British citizen it says you need to pay a fee and the form you require is some form called MN1 which I have attached as well and it will cost you about ￡400.  Unbelievable!!!  All the best.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Bernadine: Britain does not have a system of "anchor" for babies born on British soil. It is dependent on the parent's nationality. In this case the child will not be British I'm afraid.|`|6106bf75a443c7ad47b50d9b2b1cadc6aa	How long have you been here as a student ? and how did your wife come here ? These are the questions that will obviously be considered. It could well be that you had a Plan to execute, and your marriage to another Non British lady will be looked at . Was she from your Country ? How come it is only now that you wish to switch your study to Post Study visa Status ? and then what ? Frankly it would make me suspicious of your real motives. You do not yourself mention your desire to be British but want to use your baby son to make your plea. Shame on you Mr Shah .|`|H93JbQS0aa	you definately need to make a passport of the origin you have come from and also apply for visa stamp for the baby, the child on no circumstances considered british unless your status changes.<br>  <br>   I have several employees whose babies are born please speak to your countries high commission based in london they will explain the procedure.<br>  Thanks,|`|buBF9qQ5aa	We offer professional advice on UK visa application procedures.

If DFAS Denver can not collect the entire amount owed back to the government before you separate from the miltary, then they send the remaining balance to the IRS to have it deducted from your income taxes each year until the entire balance is recouped.<br>  <br>  go to DFAS.mil and look in the garnishments section for more guidance, or just google DFAS Denver for contact info.|`|3xTNOevjaa	Here, goto garmishment section:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.DFAS.mil" rel="nofollow">http://www.DFAS.mil</a>|`|4VzVfKvdaa	Two parts of your story don't make sense.  First, the air force doesn't have MOS, they have AFSC.  Second, any career field that has an enlistment bonus that high wouldn't be involved in force shaping.  The very fact that it has a bonus to come in means it's critical and no one would be put out due to force shaping.  That said, I believe you are full of it and fishing or you got kicked out and they are taking back the unused portion over the years you had left on your enlistment.  If the latter, they would have taken it all back intially; not over time unless you set up some deal at discharge (signed something you don't remember).
3QtO3SpFaa	Yes! In all 50 states, you MUST have a concealed weapons permit. Unless you are in uniform, and have the right to carry. i.e. MP's, police officers, etc.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Being in the military does not change the fact that you want to carry a concealed weapon.  To carry a concealed weapon, you would need a valid permit; with the exception of Vermont and Alaska.<br>  <br>  The army commander of Alaska did at one time restrict the carry of concealed weapons by members of his command, so you will need to check with your commanders, to insure that you are not banned by the military for carrying a weapon while off duty.|`|U69AYTZIaa	Yes you do.|`|FpMCFvV5aa	Absolutely in most states.  Unless you are carrying your weapon while in uniform as part of official duties, you must have a concealed carry permit.  People in uniform do not carry their issued weapons concealed.<br>  <br>  The next answer appears to be correct regarding Georgia.  I'd still check with law enforcement if I lived in Georgia to make sure that is the case.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Yes, you have to obtain a permit in most states to carry concealed.  These permits generally cost about $40.00 depending on what states you intend to get permits in, and they last (at least in Delaware) for 2 years.|`|OWfu0VfVaa	in most states you still do....Georgia your ID works though|`|50NKXtlVaa	Two exceptions to earlier answer.  In Vermont and Alaska you may carry concealed without a permit if you are legally allowed to own a handgun.  You may carry OPEN in many states without a permit.

n2kBUWQOaa	I picked up on that statement also.<br>  Obama said American Invented the automobile. He was wrong. And despite what others are saying in their answer, you must take the president at his word. I am not going to sit there and listent to this nutjob speak and then try to decipher what he is saying. What else did he say that is not really what he meant. He said this was going to be straight talk in this speech. Obviously it wasn't. I thin the whole speech was a load of garbage. Gloom and doom and hope and belief. Nothing but garbage. He surely didn't answer any of the questions that Americans have been asking. No clear plans, only promises and vague statements. This guy is the worst president we have had in a very long time. He is worse that Clinton ever was, and I really hated Clinton, a lot!|`|o9AAlDOMaa	Obama was MAKING a POINT.<br>  <br>  While technically the patents for the automobile in other countries may have preceded our own, those versions were largely impractical. More importantly...THEIR GOVERNMENTS passed laws that created roadblocks to their further development.<br>  <br>  THE REASON that scientists used to FLOCK HERE from other countries is because their inventions were useless. They stayed on paper.<br>  <br>  Our support of innovation IS our claim to fame. Within the context of his words, Obama was talking about the auto industry and the invention of the car FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES and as we know it. It doesn't matter where an idea originates because, for DECADES, AMERICA was THE PLACE where ideas could be made into realities. THAT was exactly what he said. <br>  <br>  We DID invent the phenomenon of the auto mobile. It was a bulky unusable piece of machinery until AMERICA's ingenuity and free enterprise system made it a reality. We built the roads. We made it possible.<br>  <br>  Did NO ONE take critical thinking skills in college?|`|f917ecaa58105d18c93396f2c027b772aa	History is full of misinformation about light bulbs, cars, electricity, medical equipment and procedures and any number of other things. Historically, credit is attributed for inventions when it was really a matter of refinement. It's not unusual, history is riddled with it. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is I want my president to know about the big issues that affect me today. PRESIDENT Obama is very aware on that point.|`|cdfaf090d61b4780b0e9991dfb477d46aa	Well Benz wasnt the person who invented it either just the first to sell them.<br>  Ford just improved upon Oldsmobile's mass production who was producing them 12 years before Ford.  <br>  But I guess the Model T was considered the first affordable car for most people so I guess in that respect it applies.|`|OdrgLFFOaa	Actually the inventor of the "automobile" was a Frenchman named Nicolas Joseph Cugnot who built the first steam powered auto in 1769.  Benz is credited with the first viable gasoline powered auto.|`|AA11614944	First, this guy is not that smart. I am still in shock that people have bought into his line of bull. P.T. Barnum was right. <br>  <br>  Second, yes, it IS correct that Ford did NOT invent the automobile.|`|EAA6GIIWaa	Germany is one of those 57 states he talked about during the election.|`|oVDQLrYSaa	Yes,but Mr. ford was the first to mass produce and sell to many.I think that was what the President was talking about.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Well you missed out on a few others Mr. Smartguy,like Daimler, Maybach and Marcus.<br>  Not a basic bit of knowledge maybe, but before those Germans there were others who did the beginning work with engines like Cugnot.<br>  <br>  Ford developed the first method that made mass production of autos at a reasonable cost a fact .  He did invent the assembly line.  Without that they would be building handmade cars for only the very wealthy and it never would have become the most common form of transportation that it is now.|`|xiB1BPwsaa	Obama probably knew it, he just twists the truth. No different than any other time he opens his mouth.<br>  <br>  First and foremost Obama is a politician, not different than any other.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	He meant that we invented the means to mass produce them.  We as a country had a population that by and large could all afford to buy one.  We made them popular, we advanced them most and we made it possible for the industry to expand enough to employ and create this countries middle class.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	He also said we need to send more Arabic translators to Afghanistan.  (official languages are Pashtu and Dari)<br>  <br>  He said he would order his joint chiefs to withdraw from Iraq.  (joint Chiefs serve an advisory role and are not in the military chain of command).<br>  <br>  Shall I go on?|`|AA11303083	Yeah i had one American claiming an American invented the traffic light, when in reality it was just an improved version of a British invention.

Its the muslim way to behead or kill people in your family that embarass you.  Why isn't he charged with 1st degree murder?|`|5TB3Q88gaa	At least he was honest about it.  How many Christian men beat and shoot their wives, stuff them in a trunk or the garbage and then lie and say, she left me and I don't know where she went?|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Kum bah yah won't change the fact that there is no such thing as a moderate Muslim.<br>  <br>  BTW, did CNN, MSNBC, ABC etc etc report this story!?!?!|`|8OaAmwq8aa	That was Cheney wearing a disguise.|`|hTFalwX6aa	Sure. <br>  <br>  In their culture you stone a disobedient wife.  He was being "good" to her...(shakes head).|`|CRAatO4Kaa	yes, it is important to understand the religion.<br>  <br>  Obama says it's peaceful and he is now supporting Sharia law in 1 province of Pakistan to keep peace with the Taliban ... until they take over the rest of Pakistan.|`|B7qO5CsYaa	Yes he proved that Muslims are crazy fanatics not only towards the US but their women also. Wow what a lovely group of people. Glad I don't have any living next door to me.|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	Religion makes me sick in this form.

u6ALw1gAaa	They are not "non" lethal.  They are less lethal.  <br>  <br>  Yes you can be killed by a "rubber" bullet.  During training you learn that firing a special impact weapon (a rubber bullet) at certain body parts is considered lethal force. Those places are the head, groin, spine, etc.  <br>  <br>  If I am going to shoot someone with a special impact weapon and the situation goes to a lethal force situation (i.e. the guy pulls a knife and comes at me) I would be justified in shooting him in the head with it.<br>  <br>  Chemical Munition and Special Impact Weapons Instructor|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Of course you can. It isn't non-lethal it's less-lethal, meaning if you get hit with it you're less likely to die :)<br>  You can be killed from anything, baseball, getting tackled, falling, punched.. you're just not as likely to die from a rubber bullet as opposed to a lead one. So get out of the way of the riot police when they tell you to :)|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	You can be killed by a baseball.|`|AA11765933	if the rubber bullet hits a sensitive area like the eye i am certain you would die|`|zejFr1Ciaa	You bet kinda like being in the wrong place at the wrong time can get you killed.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	yes you can<br>  <br>  and the term we like to use is "less lethal" because just about anything CAN cause death|`|Q7ovix19aa	Yes.

WkJJuC9Waa	I totally regret even wanting Obama in office, at first yes I did because I didnt want McCain. but the moment he went in office my heart sunk. hes NOT going to do anything well for this economy, hell did you see what was IN that stimulus package.. a waterpark. an effing WATERPARK!! there was sure, some little things that COULD start up the economy but most of it was going towards congress bologna. there was a smaller package, that could bring us soo many jobs without spending trillions of dollars. he has no clue what he is doing. hes taking steps into socialism and I do not like that at all. it was the biggest mistake I believe, that we made to put Obama in there. I dont even care about his race and Im sure some people will go off saying I believe this because of it. no, I believe this... because its true.. hes only going to bring us farther down, and make the economy worse. who KNOWS what that man has up his sleeves.. <br>  <br>  <br>  watch Gleen Beck on Fox News once, its truthful and you learn a lot about this man..|`|6Nuaqihpaa	I voted for Nader because of his environmental views, but that doesn't mean I wasn't relieved when Obama won the election.

You have stated a lot of opinions, however, no facts to base them upon. It is apparent that you do not like Obama. That's fine & your right. However, I am guessing that you are not a psychic/fortune teller. We have tried the same old policies of the other party for 8/years. Things are a mess - is an understatement. Time to try a new approach. My attitude is positive and I am willing to give anything a try, at this point. Now for some change in my current, but hopefully not too much longer, home state of CA - where the Republican governor has just signed in.....MASSIVE TAX INCREASES which got passed through after days of debating by a REPUBLICAN legislator....Yeppers, it's true!
Th0cGRctaa	Repubs don't give credit to anyone but themselves.|`|WApucF8waa	If the USA recovers under an Obama Administration, Obama won't need credit, unlike many US banks right now.|`|eVsbtvi9aa	you know how this obama haters are on here, they wont give him any chance let alone credit......they just want to see him fall!|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Republicans would never give President Obama credit<br>  but this is just politics<br>  same for the Democrats will never take the blame<br>  this is just politics|`|7130dcb06a591c8850f1c6de810da84aaa	There is precedence for having a remarkable economic and national unity recovery for which there is universal credit given to that nation's leader but is also universally identified as leading to the destruction of the country. Conservatives have no problem giving credit to Obama when appropriate. We also have no problem assigning or even projecting blame where equally appropriate. Sometimes, as is the case with transitioning from capitalism to socialism, blame and credit can be applied simultaneously.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, the historical precedence? Nazi Germany.
PKzE3AVBaa	I served in the US Army on M-1's. I also served in West Germany. I have also competed in an international competition against the leopard. Once we drew the M-1 tank, we didn't ever take less than first place. I was in C co 3/64 armor. We were the first U.S. team to take first place company level. Remember, the tank is only a tool to do a job. Our soldiers are what make our military second to none. Give a Marine a rock and he will give you a hilltop.|`|ELAsvwE3aa	I think the M1 tank has a proven track record that the German counter-part lacks.  It does not mean the German tank is not formidable, but nobody has really tested it.  Everyone thought the T-72 was a decent tank until 1991, then its only accolade was the distance its turret flew after being hit.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Concerning most of these questions, which is better or whatever, I always say that it is not the machine that is the best it is the troops that drive them that make them the best.

However, it's fairly lightly armored compared to an M1 or British Challenger.  Both have excellent cross-country mobility, the same main gun-and similar fire-control systems (based on the German/US MBT70 program of the late 1960s).  <br>  However, the M1 (and Challenger) is combat proven in no less than three major conflicts-the Leopard has yet to see combat-in a tank on tank scenario.  Though admittedly it came close to being deployed in the desert in GW1.|`|My65doewaa	The M1 and the Leopard2 are about equal.  The M1A1 is superior to the Leopard2, and the M1A2 is significantly better.

RtHq6y78aa	Because they are following the ways of their leader...WE WON and we'll do what we want.<br>  <br>  Obama said to a Republican the other day that he still wants to work with Republicans and get them to see that HIS way is right.  HOW is that working WITH them?  They make no sense.<br>  <br>  Also, they're always wrong and have to defend  the wrong position.  It brings out the inner crybaby in them.|`|lAsbD5B7aa	It seems to me, that it is the conservative posters who resort to name-calling and racist statements, rather than debating with facts on this board. I have never seen a liberal poster do what you are claiming.|`|HLtf88Zkaa	Good question.  Probably something to do with most liberals not having all the facts, so thus, they make up for it by calling names, and other low forms of teasing.  So very high school...|`|vDLnslBFaa	You mostly ask for biased opinions.<br>  What do facts have to do with anything, especially since there's none behind this question?|`|guVFlOvuaa	they should have color the monkey white ...white folks would have laugh at this  but oh no not the blacks so here we go again...white folks get ready we will never hear the end of this one|`|lVjJcUj0aa	They are used to throwing tantrums to get their way!|`|Ocyrox5baa	It's the party genes.|`|SJTD3Ocxaa	you've got to be joking?  have you taken a look at just some of the avatars out there?|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Because they are guilty of not have a thought that they can defend<br>  <br>  Therefore their best defense is to go on offense<br>  <br>  And lately the Democrats are very offensive|`|S6XSLvjLaa	It is like the lawyers creed.  If you have the facts on your side, argue facts.  If you have the law on your side argue law.  If you have neither, start yelling and screaming and hurling accusations.|`|VLO7e4tMaa	Because if you don't agree with them, it's easier to call you a racist than to try to understand your point of view.  Also, factual information seems to be irrelevant to them.

They believe in self reliance and hard work instead of government handouts.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	It varies from the people that I know. The difference I see is the reps. I know only focus on taxes while the dems see the big picture.|`|0715360bb7f3efedfc0a181245dddca8aa	Conservative without a doubt, I'm one of them.  Many like me are ticked that the auto industry has to be "bailed out" because of their own stupidity. They simply allowed the UAW to screw them over for years and we the public had to pay for it when we bought american made cars and trucks.  After years of imported cars being bought because they are more dependable and fuel efficient, the big 3 find themselves paying their union workers way too much for an inferior product and now they "We" are paying for it. <br>  <br>  Sorry for rambling on, but the auto industry is one example of how liberals want a hand out, when I believe if you work hard you should be able to make it.  Liberals believe they should be helped, look at all the lazy people in this country that sit on their cans waiting for their welfare check every month, them complain about conservative values.<br>  <br>  I'd rather be a conservative nut job, than a liberal with no nuts and no job.|`|kJM65nXJaa	Probably about equal. If I had to guess, and that is what I am doing, I'd say maybe a little more liberal. Owning a business is a risk, and liberals seem to be more willing to take risks and think outside of the box.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	Practically every answer here is a generalization...<br>  <br>  I am a moderate Democrat and a business owner.  Why people think that only repubs are business owners, I don't know.  It just shows how narrow minded you all are.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	The ones who want to grow and profit I would think are conservative.

It may take a few years...but his brand of socialism will fail...just like every other socialist economy.|`|WApucF8waa	No, the antics of the free market fundamentalists are the most dangerous threat to the free market. People who have no understanding of protective role of law are always those who bring on the greatest, most crushing responses. It is as Dostoevsky said, "Boundless liberty begets boundless tyranny." The market sought to become its own regulation, and it succeeded to a great extent, and it soared...and crashed.<br>  <br>  We need government to regulate business.<br>  <br>  The Obama administration has so far proven to be curiously weak in its response to bankers' disastrous follies. The US Government should be nationalizing banks for re-sale later. Taxpayers are getting ripped-off to preserve the illusion of a continuing cowboy capitalism. Its Ponderosa government subsidy ranches time now in Masters of the Universe investment banking land.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Nah.

Ron Paul is an honorable exception.|`|bkav003oaa	It was not fantastic, but it wasn't horrible.

Actually, I have heard reps. on here say the speech was great & McCain is acting like it was. I think he is laughing inside knowing that Palin, Jindal & Steele make him look better.

Can you imagine if we would have had all of this transparency all along?  Maybe the screaming would have started years ago BEFORE we got in this mess.  Enough blame to around?  Yep.  But don't act like your so smart when you are a big part of the problem.  When Americans didn't have all of the information they didn't know who to yell at, they just watched the deficit in ignorant bliss get worse and worse.  I guess some liked it that way.|`|LZLQKUMPaa	just remember the dams have been in charge since 2006 and they did nothing to lose the blame if you're so smart .since 06 been going downhill .the barrel oil is about the same for cheaper than 06 you're paying about about dollar a gallon now look at dollars seven days to $2.00 a young and more .dams of the one for the job haven't what they can campaign on at the end of 05 to be elected|`|kr6nMXcLaa	Uh I think Bush signed the bills and he is a Republicon.|`|AA10079277	BINGO.  I asked a similar question.  What "inheriting" is Obama referring to.?  Most new administrations can claim they inherited a mess because most new administrating are governors, people from outside of Washington.  Obama was in Congress and he was a Democrat.  Democrats have been in control for the last two years.  <br>  They are at least 51% at fault.  Republicans are also at fault.  <br>  <br>  for Obama to claim he was "surprised" to learn about the mess, and he "inherited" this mess means he must have missed every single vote in congress.<br>  <br>  Intriguing new term one answerer has invented here: "lame duck congress".  I guess that is an attempt to absolve them of responsibility.  Bush never vetod any of the Democrat congress bills.  He went along with them all.  <br>  <br>  It is interesting that republicans say the blame is on both sides, but nearly all democrats, especially here on Yahoo Answers, deny even a shred of responsibility in the mess.

5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	tell her to call children services, explain the situation and ask how best deal with it. Technically the father can insist on that type of visit and get it, irregardless of what kind of father he is. Only way one can stop it is IF she can prove it would endanger the child physically, like he was a drunk, an addict, etc...............in that case a supervised visit would be arranged|`|sdXzS7rpaa	If mum can prove that the father is unfit, then they won't let him take the boy.<br>  <br>  If the father is proven to make an effort, and is dotted as sane, and competent, chances are extremely likely that he will be able to take his son for a bit. He could even go for shared custody or the like.<br>  <br>  Just because she doesn't want him to take their son for personal reasons isn't reason enough. There has to be proof. <br>  <br>  If she thinks he'll be safe with his father, she'll probably want to save a lot of time and money and just come to an agreement. Chances are possible that he'll disappear for awhile longer, anyhow. But it's also possible that they'll foster a positive relationship which could be healthy for the boy.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	The dad has every right to see his child, regardless of how much time he's spent with him in the past. If he needed to he could go to court and get a firm visitation schedule put in place. Which could mean every other weekend and rotating holidays. If he's current on his child support and isn't a danger to the child (i.e. criminal/drug user) then I can't see a judge not granting his request for these visits.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  YES the court would allow it.<br>  <br>  reedit:<br>  You say the mother encourages visits to the father, yet won't allow him a week long visit? What better way to get to know each other and to bond then to spend a week on holiday together. It's also a good way to break the child of his dependency on his Mum. <br>  <br>  I'd still have to say the court would side with the father. Sorry.|`|96d31f2eb78b0da781f956843c10646baa	In all such cases, if you were to pursue some form of court order (prohibitive steps order for instance), the Family Court will take into account what is best for the child.  <br>  <br>  You do not give any indication of how the child feels about spending time alone with his father or, in fact, what your actual query is.<br>  <br>  If the query is about the rights of an absent parent, then as I understand it, if the absent parent is not or has not been married to the mother, his rights are almost nonexistent - he simply has a legal responsibility to financially maintain his child until such time as the child reaches majority.  Any rights the father wishes to obtain must be done so through the Family Court (or informal arrangements).<br>  <br>  Good luck anyway.

AA11838675	Yes. They get extra hunting/fishing rights. Free housing (on reservations) and receive yearly checks from the government. At least that's what goes on in Wisconsin. I don't begrudge them any of it.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	Yes, the term "benefit" requires interpretation, as really does the loaded term "socialist".  Indians (native americans in the US or first nations in Canada) do obtain government assistance when eligible.  Given that these people have been often (one could almost say always, but that would not be quite true) herded onto lands of little value or use, the people residing there are often in need of assistance.<br>  <br>  Calling unique hunting and fishing rights part of these programs is incorrect.  Those rights typically were granted as part of treaty or have since been judged acquired rights due to their existence prior to the incorporation of the native lands by the europeans (or the governments subsequently created in North America that descend directly from the European powers).|`|ItOhkbj8aa	Hey Wally they benefit from treaty rights, the guy you reffer to you blocked as he tried to answer, couldn't and emailed me, as you are a racist.|`|MKNj2B0Daa	As do Blacks, whites, yellows, browns, its not a racial thing, and you are Stereo typing races which is racist|`|XpcXs7qMaa	Depends on what you mean by "benefit".  We can get food stamps if we qualify and unemployment if we have worked enough in the quarter to qualify.  We do not get $$ handouts.  Many of us are still living on the reservation in lower than poverty levels because of a lack of education.  Many of us are college graduates that paid our own way through college and are now in high paying positions, and yes some positions in government.  So to answer your question with just a yes or no can not be done.  And we will know that racism has left America when an American Indian has become President and gives the land back to it's people, American People.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	actually its the rest of americans that benefit from socialist programs of natives turning over land and resource rights so that usa can be the richest country on the planet until your governments wastes it all and then turns to natives again for even MORE. i guess your greed knows no bounds and neither do most know any shame.

They're more important than most of us think because they fund things like roads, education, etc. I took part in a political research study about a week ago, and the tax issue was brought up. I said that if we cut taxes, we cut funding, and if we cut funding, that cuts education. If we all want stable futures, cutting education isn't the road to success. <br>  You have to keep in mind that spending is what helps our economy. Prices rise anyway, and have for a very long time. Of course you know this (or at least I'm sure you do), but inflation has been happening for a really, really long time.<br>  Also, in regards to the loss of jobs. You have to be patient with the president. He's only been in for a month. We must give him time to help lead us. The fact that 300,000 jobs were lost within a month doesn't mean we can't gain them back. We just need to centralize more, and we have them back.|`|v3Motq8Iaa	Get some education.  Market responses like those (fees, pricing, unemployment) are carry-over responses to the momentum of market conditions existing months in advance.

People are afraid to attack him at the moment because we (as a nation) still have to get over racism.  He will make mistakes.  He has come at a time in history that we need major changes to happen.  The people that believe that he is the light that we need to fix our issue are we are emotional invested in: jobs, education, health care, and other items.  Others are emotional invested because he is the first black to be in the higher public office that we have.<br>  <br>  But you have to remember that he has only been in office completely for about a month.  The 300,000 job were on his watch but he has not had time to do anything to change the situation that we are in today.  These things came up through the years and years of government.  1935 Roosevelt did the "widows fund" or welfare in which at the time 50% of the children getting it had a widowed mother, 21% had been abandon by the fathers, 17% had incapacitated fathers, and only 2% had unmarried mothers.  In addition, Roosevelt was told that this could create a "chronic dependent" in the black community due to the cotton and other industries (seasonal jobs normal that paid low wages) that were worked by the black men at that time.  Therefore, we can blame Roosevelt for the welfare issues.  Banks offered loans to people who could not really afford it with loans that did not make common sence.  Clinton did not go after the people who bombed the boat at the time which in part helped create 9/11 and the war.  Regan make ketchup a veg in school lunch programs.  And Bush started a war that we will be paying for in the future that we might not even be able to get out of.  It is the same old story.  We are paying for the mistakes that our four father made and they were paying for the ones that their four fathers made.  We just have to try and weather this storm.|`|YOGgHoNdaa	You really can't blame Obama for our economic crisis . .. He's magical . . but not THAT magical!

If they don't find enough compelling evidence (again, this is known to have been done by 'Truthers' who claim the Govt did it), they digitally alter images and footage to trick people into believing their story, and as they have previously demonstrated, it is not beneath them to use quotes out of context and blatantly change the quote entirely.<br>  <br>  Another site to have a look at is this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://911myths.com/" rel="nofollow">http://911myths.com/</a>|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	I looked at the site you posted, thank you.<br>  <br>  This, I think is even more convincing, please take a look, it will help your argument with those unpatriotic Americans:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://patriotsquestion911.com/" rel="nofollow">http://patriotsquestion911.com/</a>|`|hOSOawRHaa	You don't seem to understand something about American politics, osama and his cohorts spend a considerable amount of money on technology, technology that's produced in you guessed it, the USA!

8OaAmwq8aa	I guess what bothers and rankles my feathers is how any working person in the USA can blame other workers for the wages that they receive or for the problems in the economy.  Doing so, in my opinion, shows a disregard or ignorance for U.S. labor history.  It highlights the success that the owning class has had in pitting worker against worker while absconding with the material wealth that all workers have collectively created.  CEO's don't create any new wealth.  Workers do.  And destructive Capitalist CEOs, and the owning class, do nothing but manipulate the labor and commodity-money-commodity exchanges so that all wealth can trickle up from the worker on the bottom to the CEOs at the top.  The owning class has been doing this for centuries.  They have been riding the worker-created gravy train during the times of Capitalism's boom cycle while blaming the worker for Capitalism's bust cycle.  The owning class always wins.  The working class, however, has been trained by them, to blame itself when the bust arrives.  Welcome to the bust.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	It wasn't the "rich" or "greed" that caused this . . . it was Liberal Politicians like Barney Frank and Chris Dodd protecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (because they got huge campaign donations from Fannie and Freddie).   <br>  <br>  The Liberals forced banks to make loans to people who could not repay them . . . .<br>  <br>  Had enough of little barry obama's Socialist agenda?<br>  <br>  Write the yo-yo's in Washington a letter and give them a piece of your mind.

prMwhfsxaa	I am all for medical use of marijuana but I think California has already taken it too far.  I work in an adolescent rehab center and have seen many times where use and abuse of weed leads.  I don't hate it or think it is really any worse than alcohol but I don't think legalizing it is a good idea.  It is just going to convince all those people who already think it is not a bad drug that it is fine.  It is a drug, maybe not as bad as others, maybe, but it still has bad effects.  If they do legalize than 21 should be the age but I hope they don't.  It will just lead us down a road I don't think we are prepared for.  Here is a link of bad effects:<a href="http://www.marijuana-addiction.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marijuana-addiction.info/</a><br>  It is a myth that it is not addictive and doesn't have bad effects.

True, it will not immediately stimulate the economy, but in order for our children to compete in a worldwide economy, it is essential.

Shouldn't we at least give them the opportunity to make enough money to pay it off?|`|erw1bkogaa	No. You have to have 14 kids and be "mentally unstable" to collect welfare.  It really pisses me off when I see all these welfare cases in Baltimore sitting on their stoops selling drugs and drinking 40's. I'm tired of it. Especially when I am paying my bills and holding my fort down.  If you work for a living, you have to agree. Why should you support someone who is capable, but chooses not to because the government allows you to be lazy?|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	just because you go to college doesn't mean you are employable,  just because you didn't doesn't mean you aren't employable.<br>  <br>  McDonalds University is the best some people will ever do.|`|8diTOnNiaa	well lets see, the average college tuition is around 15,000 subtract 2,500      you call this free   LOL|`|WD6uLJxvaa	No he is not

So giving out big tax breaks and coporate welfare isn't an handout?  I didn't get that impression at all especially when Mr. President said every American should get an college education.

AA10138269	People who have answered have forgotten that the government is made up with individuals. Individuals who have an spiritual conviction in whether to help or not those really need it or those who are co-dependent. It's impossible to filter out the ones who relentless and those who are in absolute need. To me I feel sad that the government has to take from our paychecks or increase our taxes just to help those who rely on social government programs. Some who claim to have morals should have stepped up to the plate before hand and maybe the government would not have welfare,food stamps,medicaid and etc....Christians suppose to abide by the good book and that's to help all regardless of their economic class or status but it's unfortunate that some only want to help those in families,social clubs and circle of friends of their own culture,race and ethnicity.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	OK, as soon as you get all of the dead beat individuals off of welfare that don't deserve it then we'll go with your plan.

When called upon to act in a truly Christian manner, they run an d hide.|`|AUcPY9Veaa	maybe yes,because they are the rich one so they must help the poor one's who need some support.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	YOUR question is: surely the idea that the rich should support the less fortunate is part and parcel of the Christian philosophy?<br>  <br>  ANSWER -- yes, but ONLY on a "voluntary basis."<br>  <br>  The FACT  ---  conservatives ALREADY do that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/conservatives_more_liberal_giv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  Thanks for pointing it out, though . . . . conservatives, evangelicals give MORE to charity than liberals do.   Conservatives even donate more BLOOD than liberals do . . . .<br>  <br>  That's becaause Liberals think the government is the solution to every problem and Conservatives believe individuals are the solution to every problem.<br>  <br>  The early church did practice a form of "collectivism" . . . but the "difference" between that, and what Obama is supporting it that Christians did it voluntary.<br>  <br>  You talk about giving to the "less fortunate" . . . .but your "annointed one" little barry obama . . .. hasn't even helped his own HALF-BROTHER.  <br>  <br>  Why should he tax us to help the poor of the world when HE, . . . a MILLIONAIRE . . . won't open his own damn wallet to help his own half-BROTHER living in a hut, just outside of Nairobi, Kenya????<br>  <br>  Dan in Miami|`|4b28c8d6c4701c9b0210498b25f2c3faaa	I believe that Christs own words explain their actions best in the book of Matthew, chapter 6:<br>  <br>  6:1 “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.<br>  <br>  2 “Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.<br>  <br>  5 “And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.<br>  <br>  7 “And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think that Christ is right.  Those that wear their spirituality on there sleeve publicly just to appear Christian are just hypocrites.  How can a true Christian just deposit Christs' philosophies in a box at the door when entering the politics arena?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Not only is Dan's article biased, so is the book that the article talks about.  The author of the book focuses mostly on the charitable giving to the arts and medical research.  Very little of the flawed and biased study deals with giving to charities that help the poor.  Apparently misrepresenting the truth is also a republican ideal.|`|882aadf45b04a15ccacc11c27555a716aa	I'm considered ULTRA Conservative because I am of Libertarian philosophy.  The Christ's own words..."Do unto others as you would have done unto you", is a perfect example of Christ promoting INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM FROM OTHERS CONTROL.<br>  The "helping the poor" is an individual choice NOT governmental mandate,  which would be illegal according to our Constitution.  America's founding fathers were Libertarian in philosophy & most were of the Christian faith.  Our Founding fathers were DEATH ON TAXES & governmental control of the people.  There was NO Constitutional provision made for people to OWE other people anything what so ever period.<br>  There was not even a provision made federally for a draft in case America was attacked by foreign powers.  That is how serious our founding fathers took INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM.  They were literally promoting ABSOLUTE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, same as JC did in the quote of His I listed above.
gZEn8k6Saa	Jindal had good substance but like you said following one of the best presenter Presidents is hard. Not to mention the President had a large setting, a crowd, clapping, etc. He admitted the Republicans lost trust rightfully so and this is their principals. I think he did well just didn't speak well.|`|hP4viLh5aa	If you think his intentions were good.How could you possibly use the word Slick to discribe him.

LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	Jindal agreed with the president as to what the problems and priorities are but not with the solution. He seems to align himself with the same philosophy as was in place in the early 30's before the New Deal. Economists and historians concur that the New Deal did boost the economy in the short term but had no sustainability because the economy was allowed to sink too low before taking action. From all I've read on it, it is strongly believed that the New Deal could have rescued us from the great depression if it had been introduced years sooner. Jindal contends, because of the Katrina response, we cannot and should not rely on the government. His answer to our failing public schools isn't to make them better but provide vouchers so people can send their kids to private schools. His answer to health care and energy is "people, get going on that but don't expect any support from the Fed".<br>  Well, on the upside, we won't have to worry about the republicans recouping power in the near future if that's all they have to offer.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Because reducing big business taxes doesn't work.  That's what Bush did.

I'm not sure that they will help either.|`|aQjl8niPaa	Oh please, Jindal was saying what great things the repubs did for Katrina victims. Please, after they let them marinate for a few days.

At least, President Obama is setting an example of articulateness, elegance, seemingly fair play, and the desire to help everyone out of the morass his predecessor did so much to worsen. Heavens, just by stopping torture, he has accomplished something! How telling that he only has to do what is decent, and he looks like a saviour after the Bush regime.|`|yRAU9MJDaa	Do you call 9% unemployment accomplishing more good?  Obama did no such thing.

R7Hexutqaa	No.<br>  <br>  He is cutting taxes now.  He proposes to let the Tax cuts for the rich expire next year - They were a bad idea and did not stimulate the economy (just look out the window) - and coupled with war spending added trillions to the debt.<br>  <br>  No banks are being nationalized.  It's called receivership and that is what is done with failed businesses and institutions.  The government is only involved because of the size of the failure and what is at stake.  <br>  <br>  A capital gains increase is probably a bad idea, but the threat of one is a really good idea.  If all those rich people sitting on their investments think the tax rate is about to double they will turn over those investments and plow their profits into new investments - which will get money moving again.  Then Obama can pull back from the capital gains hike (or reduce it) and say 'Psyche! - Gotcha!'<br>  <br>  Except for AIG and a couple of other big monsters the 'bailouts' are actually loans or investments - meaning that if everything works the governments makes money.  Your response to this might be to leave it to private enterprise - the trouble is private enterprise won't touch it.  Saving business in that is in crises because of a double whammy of a recession and frozen credit markets, and not an issue with the basic business model makes all kinds of sense.  GM, FORD, And Chrysler may end up smaller and different - but we will still need cars.  They could weather a storm of recession if they could get loans.  They could whether a storm of frozen credit if they could sell cars.  But right now they can't do either without help.<br>  <br>  And as for slavery of debt - Look to Republicans.  When Obama took office 75% of the accumulated 10 trillion dollar debt was produced by just 3 administrations:  Reagan, Bush 1, Bush 2.

yvPA8FSsaa	Cutting the gas tax was a good idea because it focused directly on the problem.  The problem was gasoline prices that more than doubled in a very short time. It had a very negative effect on the economy.  <br>  <br>  $13 per week is fine but the effects will be diluted.  If a person received a lump sum of $676 that would be useful but $13 per week over an entire year is not very useful.  <br>  <br>  Let's say you have a credit card balance of $2000.  A quick shot of cash like that would greatly lower the balance.  But at $13 dollars a week, the interest continues to accrue which negates the effect of the additional money.  <br>  <br>  Anyone who understands economics can tell you that money now is worth far more than money over time.  "A bird in hand is worth two in the bush".<br>  <br>  Besides, once you get a lump sum you can put it to immediate use.  The $13 per week can be recinded at any time as conditions change.

We put our pets down to get them out of pain, why not people? To those who can't have children, our pets *are* children.<br>  <br>  I don't believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control - that's irresponsible and stupid.  They should've taken the proper precautions before having sex.  If you really don't want kids, you will do anything to prevent yourself from conceiving.  To alot of people, conception is an afterthought when having unprotected sex.  As if they didn't believe it could happen to them, like they're the exception to the rule.  <br>  <br>  If we had proper sex education, abortion wouldn't really be an issue.  The pro-lifers & religious just believe that abstinance is the only true sex ed children require and it's just not realistic.  It should remain legal. Once you have a right that's suddenly taken away, people will go to extremes to maintain their right. Look at prohibition. That was a dumb idea and alot of people died to preserve their right to drink. Women have been dying for centuries for having illegal botched abortions because they had no other alternative.  More women are going to die if we take abortion away. It may not be morally correct to some, but it's necessary we keep our rights in tact.  <br>  <br>  The religious groups have to learn to hold their tongue because not everyone follows their views, and they have to learn to accept or tollerate that.|`|pNy8lakjaa	Completely depends on the situation. If its incest or rape, that is a perfectly valid excuse for an abortion. However a woman should think twice on how to handle herself in other situations.|`|AA10436595	It is murder, pure and simple.

At the time I knew i couldn't and had to make a decision, I think its smarter then those girls who have babies in the bathroom and throw them in the garbage.

It is legal now, but if it was banned in the future, some people would be upset and complain and protest to have it legalized again. <br>  <br>  I do lean more to the pro-choice side. I do not like the idea of using it as a form of contraceptive, but it is legal for that, and I will not stand in anyone way if they want to. I also think it is an option for rape, incest, or for the protection of the life of the mother.|`|2fd8Bltdaa	I am Pro-choice. Woman should be able to choose if they want to have a baby or not. It's true that if a woman is not ready to have a baby then she should not be having sex, however, things happen. People don't always make the wisest choices.<br>  <br>  And I do not believe that schools need a better Sex Ed program in order to steer teens away from having sex. With or without a well developed program, teens are going to have sex.|`|AA10379416	Based on my religious beliefs I am totally against it... however, legally it can be argued that it is the constitutional right of the woman to make the decision (unfortunately)... all I can do is try to explain the ethical, moral and emotional principles behind abortion so that the person can make an informed decision before expressing this constitutional right.|`|vRp9AqnNaa	every women should have the right to choose,  my opinion is prob not much help but i am against them completely with one exception. the only reason i feel anybody should get an abortion is if they are raped. and i think that if you get an abortion past the 3wk mark you're just killing your unborn baby|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	it definitely has it's place.......for rape victims, I have empathy for, unwanted teenage pregnancies, i have empathy for...........|`|5xS7sQOgaa	I'm pro-life<br>  It's not the destruction of fetuses I'm against<br>  It's that the women gets to make a choice|`|yoS4cAszaa	I am against it for the most part but think it could be used in certain circumstances.|`|dHPA390Qaa	If a woman has not planned the conception of a baby, and will be unfit as a parent due to not wanting a baby, she should abort the pregnancy as soon as she knows about it.  It is better then making her have that baby so she can resent it, abuse it, neglect it, and raise it up to be a person with mental and social problems.<br>  A fetus has no soul.  Babies receive a soul upon taking the 'breath of life'.

CNSGz12zaa	We don't, but we also think that you should help those that are less fortunate when you can and that everyone has a right to EAT and to get health care. Republicans think that it is survival of the fittest every man for himself. This is not in tune with our Christian values.

Unless there is someone else in the child's life ready to adopt them and take the rights and responsibilities the rights probably won't be terminated (unless the father is found completely unfit). Termination of rights doesn't mean termination of responsibility, if the child is not adopted by another party he may still be required to pay support- if the mother has been on any government assistance the father will likely pay to the state for what they have had to pay for the child. Get with a family lawyer in Oklahoma to answer particulars to your case, but it is not a clear yes or no- it depends on circumstances.|`|AA10118655	Why did he sign his right away? If someone else adopted the child, then no, he would no longer have any legal obligations to the child. If not, then he may still have to.

Obligations is the financial support to help the other parent raise the child.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	you'd best use google to find the specific law in Oklahoma.<br>  <br>  much may depend on the circumstances -- for example, if a man simply renounces his rights, this does not and should not relieve him of his legal obligations to support his child.

How is our social security program doing? Thank GOD government is taking over the banks, mortgages, etc...!  I know my money will be well managed and not diverted for something else.<br>  <br>  As Fannie and Freddie crumbled Chris Dodd and Obama both received over $100,000 each (look it up). Kinda interesting also to see $150 million spent on an inauguration for a president that has over 30 cases questioning his eligibility to be president, one petition has 280,000 American citizens signatures last time I looked. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately I believe our best years in America are behind us. I think a new world order will emerge soon and we will be slaves. Obama doesn't value life - look up his ILL record and also that of Kathleen Sibelius, who is Obama's top choice for Health Sec. If they don't value the lives of babies, next is the issue of euthanasia, and next will be the idea of population control for environmental health. <br>  <br>  Our leaders are engaged in a concerted effort to bring about "stability" in the world through a loss of sovereignty. Look up New World Order, Bilderberg group, etc.... We cannot GOD to bless America when our leaders are immoral and have a love of money, selling this country and our principles away.|`|AA11369432	get up ,brush off and try it again....|`|fKFvzlzQaa	The Dow will not hit zero.<br>  <br>  It is actually healthy for the Dow to drop to the point that stocks are not overpriced.<br>  <br>  The economic bubbles where the Dow stocks become overvalued is actually far more harmful to our economy compared with the times that the Dow falls to more accurately reflect the true value of the underlying stocks.<br>  <br>  The drop in the Dow is painful, I have lost some money in the stock market myself, however it is far more important that the Dow represent the true value of the stocks and not be as overvalued as the Dow was in the past few years.

CMjSkDOMaa	Dating....no, but sex...probably. I say probably because age of consent laws differ by area. In Virginia, age of consent is 16, but it is considered statutory rape if one party to the act is 18 or over and the other is younger than 18. Check legal definitions in your state.<br>  <br>  Side note: I'm not trying to judge here, but I would really like you to think about the age difference and the implications of pursuing a relationship with this man. Age differences really aren't a big deal as we get older (such as a 30 year old dating a 35 year old for example) but at 15 and 20 the differences are astounding. I take it you're in high school, and he is either in college or working. Those are very different places in life to be. I'm not saying you're immature- simply that you two probably have vastly different life experiences at this age. What would a 20 year old want with a 15 year old besides a physical relationship? In the end, it is your choice, but remember once you cross that line you can never come back. Just take some time and think about it. I wish you the best of luck.|`|AA11102015	Illegal to date? No... but don't look for approval from your parents about it. If you were to fool around, THAT'S illegal, and he could go to jail for statutory rape. <br>  <br>  While dating someone who's more mature than you are seems like a good idea, especially considering the maturity level of guys your own age, chances are, he's looking for sex first, relationship second. As he ages, his maturity level is going to change drastically within the next 2-3 years, and he'll be looking for an older girl to date, considering you won't be able to go to bars or clubs, drink, or participate in "adult" activities (no, I don't mean sex here). <br>  <br>  I've been where he is, and while her parents loved me, the maturity level issue killed the relationship. We stayed friends, even to this day, but the whole dating thing just didn't work. <br>  <br>  My advice: wait to date someone closer to your age.|`|AA10118655	Dating is fine.

gmaCvh00aa	That's a good question, I guess what we would need to find is the ratio of rapes to rape/murders.<br>  <br>  I'm going blind right now because I've been online too long but I found this site that might have it for you.|`|c07v7O80aa	Overall, it is rare, compared to the total number of sexual assaults. But there are specific types of rapists. Some of them are in no way dangerous (other than the rape). Some can be dangerous. Some are always very dangerous and are always moving closer to murdering a victim and will do it, if they are not caught. The truth is we don't know how many of those there. There are a fair number of women missing under circumstances that makes it almost sure they were abducted and killed and very likely raped. There are also a fair number of entirely unidentified female murder victims who were very likely raped. So, it's not how often rapists kill, it's how many people are being attacked by killer rapists.

This includes recruits who are married (or who have ever been married), recruits who require a dependency waiver, recruits with a history of collection accounts, bankruptcy, closed uncollected accounts or bad credit. In the Air Force, it also includes any recruit who is at least 23 years of age. In general, the services are attempting to ensure that the recruit can meet current financial obligations on military active duty pay. For example, the Air Force uses the "40 percent rule." Any recruit who's monthly consumer debts (not counting debts which can be deferred, such as student loans) exceeds 40 percent of his/her anticipated military pay is ineligible for enlistment. <br>  <br>  The Navy policy examines total indeptness, rather than monthly payments. The Navy Recruiting Regulation States: <br>  <br>  <br>  No person may be selected who has a history of bad checks (unless through bank error), repossessions, cancelled or suspended charge accounts, or indebtedness exceeding half the annual salary of the paygrade at which the person is being recruited. If indebtedness includes a long-term mortgage, total indebtedness must not exceed 2 ? times the annual salary.<br>  <br>  The Marines use the same Financial Eligibility Determination forms that the Navy uses. However, the Marines only do a Financial Eligibility Determination when the individual requires a Dependency Waiver. As part of the Dependency Waiver approval process, the applicant is interviewed by the Recruiting Commander (or his/her representative), who ensures, as part of the interview/review process that the recruit would be able to meet their current financial obligations on military pay. <br>  <br>  Like the Marines, the Army only does a Financial Eligibility Determination when a Dependency Waiver is Required|`|n2oEhdZiaa	pay your debts by joining the marines!

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	I live in Texas, and I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|AA11206283	There are some incredibly evil beings out there who are committing the most horrible crimes imaginable against the weakest and least of us.

A lot of what I found surprised and disturbed me.  Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|ESAVdvdxaa	well, the death penalty seems a bit archaic to be honest. Killing people wont necessarily reduce the crime rate. I can understand why some say that the death penalty is a good idea because ou would therefore simply get rid of the criminals. But also, where do you judge the levels at which you execute the criminal, because they stole money or because they killed someone. Its a bit tricky assessing each case. I think<br>  <br>  The US seems to have a rather different correctional system. You get bust for stealing a large amount and you get put in jail for longer than that of someone that mass murdered. Little weird. I stand to correction of course.|`|0c0c10aaa2ed97e03b187aae5e2dfd9baa	I think we need it for a couple reasons.<br>  Not just kill everybody that kills another, But it<br>  needs to be an option for anyone who is convicted of murder. And for THE MANY that get away with it or do there little time and get out and DO IT AGAIN. The Death penalty for sure!<br>  It's simple and complicated also.

AA11707728	The US constitution does not have the right of no discrimination.  In fact, our original method of government discriminated heavily....only white, male, land owners were allowed to even vote.  And of course, black people were originally slaves (as were alot of other white and other non-black people....something not talked about in the history books).  What the constitution did give people though were certain rights....freedom of religion, freedom of speech, right to equal protection under the law, etc.  Over time, these were LATER expanded.  Slavery was made illegal (a concept americans invented by the way, ending, for the most part, the institution of slavery throughout the world for the first time in human history).  Everyone, including women and blacks were given the right to vote.<br>  <br>  Many forms of discrimination have been outlawed.  However, there is no constitutional right to this.  Discrimination, by the way, is not what you say but what you do.  For example, if you refuse to hire black people, that is discrimination and illegal.  If you dislike black people and say so, that is free speech, not discrimination.  Unlike, say, the UK, that is LEGAL in the US.  In the UK, it's a violation of their incitement to racism laws, or whatever they call it these days.<br>  <br>  What you are really asking in your question is if bigotry is made illegal by the US constitution.  The answer to that is no.  But there are many behaviors associated with bigotry which ARE illegal.  You can't not hire certain people.  You can't not rent to certain people. etc.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to note.  Almost ALL cases where these laws are violated, involves foriegners.  Very few US citizens hold bigoted beliefs and far fewer would choose to act on them.  Not so with people who come here from other countries.  It's actually quite a problem as the concept is alien to many.  Very common for someone from say, south korea to come to the US, buy an apartment complex, for example, and decide to rent ONLY to other koreans.  They don't understand that is illegal here and get into trouble.|`|AA11206283	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

Listen closely and I won't have to explain it more than once. <br>  <br>  They will say it's not the individual that will pay for the increased cost, it's the employer. It will be those nasty old companies who will foot the bill not you and me.<br>  <br>  But stop for a minute and think about that. Where will the companies get the money from? It will come from the sale of products and services. And who pays for these products and services? In some cases you and I do. In others it may go through a level or two before it gets to us. But the end user pays for everything. <br>  <br>  Now if the company has more taxes to pay what happens to the price of the goods or services? It goes up.

3caq6SFxaa	People need to work to pay taxes to support those that don't/can't/won't is the simple answer.  Sweden had to make major changes to their system some years ago when it got to the point that half the population was working and paying high taxes to support the half of the population that was collecting.  Yes the ratio did get to about 50/50 before the system started to collapse and another major problem was the people working were the older people and the young were choosing not too because they were entitled to what they were getting.  So as the older workers retired it was getting progressively worse.  I keep hearing housing being talked about as a right-the necessity is shelter which can be many things besides "owning a house" such as a rented apartment, rented house, homeless shelter set up by the government or a charity, and so forth.  The necessity is shelter and "owning your own home" is not a necessity-it is a goal you strive for and a luxury.|`|SRDPnnIMaa	no one will<br>  <br>  not EVERYONE  can be on welfare|`|HLf1QYd1aa	We shouldn't.

3caq6SFxaa	The main problem is he has so far refused to provide a copy of his birth certificate and that is why the law suits continue.  The law suits which have been dismissed were not because they were deemed frivolous but on the technicality that the person (previously voters and the initial was a Democratic supporter of H. Clinton) does not have standing to bring the suit; the suit needed to be brought by some one directly effected such as another candidate who ran.  I don't understand the reasoning but that was the ruling.  President Obama's response since the start has been stone walling and refusing to provide a copy and asking for it to be dismissed on the technicality that they have no standing and it is the responsibility of the political party nominating him to ensure he is a legal candidate.  He did provide a scanned certificate of live birth from Hawaii on his web site but a certificate of live birth is not legally the same thing as a birth certificate and in the case of Hawaiian state law can be issued regardless of where you were born it just says you were born and they have evidence of that but won't show you and was not certified.  Really could be easily resolved if he would provide a certified copy of his birth certificate.  More then one issue-where he was born, was/is he a citizen solely of the US (cannot be dual citizenship under the great majority of legal Constitutional opinion) and did his mother renounce his US citizenship when he was in Indonesia and attended school.  Under Indonesian law at the time you could not attend school unless you were and Indonesian citizen and they did not recognize dual citizenship.  Some other issues are being brought up but those are the main ones.  I really believe with the exception of the "if his parents renounced his citizenship" question they are really immaterial-Born in Kenya or Hawaii I really do not think matters outside of showing a lack of honesty and if born in Kenya the dual citizenship could be tricky but that would have gone away at 18 but could be questionable but again shows a lack of honesty but if the last is true he is not native born under the Constitution and technically would be an illegal alien since he reentered the country claiming to be a citizen and wasn't.  Once citizenship is renounced you can only regain it through the same procedures as a legal immigrant and that means you are not native born.|`|YupMCYHlaa	This is a long-established Republican tactic.  You might remember when President Clinton was in office, the Republicans accused him of many crimes, a new one every week or two.  Small crimes like stopping all traffic at Los Angeles Airport so he could get a haircut on the runway in Air Force One, and large crimes like murdering members of his staff, raping a woman, selling drugs, and selling nuclear secrets to the Chinese.  They spent millions of dollars investigating these accusations but never were able to find any evidence.  Yet they repeated these accusations over and over, long after they'd been discredited.  They figured if people heard enough accusations they'd figure where there's smoke there must be fire.<br>  <br>  Now they're doing it with Obama.  The lie about his birth certificate, that he's a Muslim, etc.<br>  <br>  Obama produced a copy of his birth certificate but Republican talk-show hosts say it wasn't the -original-.  But nobody can get his original birth certificate, that stays in the files and they make you a certified copy.  If he keeps addressing the problem, then it looks like he's trying to cover something up.<br>  <br>  This is just how the Republicans work.  They believe in winning at any cost.  And in every election they lower the bar a little more with dirty tricks, smears and slimy tactics.|`|VBHOiIBlaa	Obama at this point has spent over $1.2 Million dollars on his Lawyer Defense team to keep his Birth Certificate sealed and to block all attempts to get it unsealed. He did show a CERTIFICATE OF LIVE BIRTH (which in Hawaii means that a child was BORN alive and not stillborn, and that child can be anywhere as long as its filed with the hawaiian regristrar by an immediate family member)<br>  <br>  Question is.... WHY would someone still continue to invest over $1.2 million on lawyers to block his Birth Certificate, when you can just show it for free and be done with it?<br>  <br>  Hell, for $1.2 million dollars I would walk butt-naked from Los Angeles to New York with mine stapled to my forhead.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	1.

I have been a supporter of Obama since he came into office, but something about this just doesn't seem right. Why would he not just show the public his birth certificate. And No, he hasn't actually shown the public the original, hes released a copy. How anyone became president without showing their birth certificate is beyond me, I didn't even think this would ever be possible. therefore, the situation seems a little odd to me. here's an interesting video explaining some things about his copy that he released. of course, i've always been told, believe nothing that you hear and only half of what you see...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIsQJNTvlUE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIsQJNTvl...</a>|`|AA11488001	I thought you were goofy at first still going after this.But then I started looking myself and am now not sure.The links below explain alot of what you're talking about.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	He still has not prodcued an actual birth certificate.|`|AA11600810	He has never produced a birth certificate, a lot of people want to see it.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	CHECK THIS OUT GO TYPE IN <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=page.vie..." rel="nofollow">http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=page.vie...</a> if you really want to find out check this out.

IW3jmnKbaa	No, the US government only takes bribes from large corporations, and banks, only they call it "contributions". and yeah, it get's things done, like "bailouts", "tax breaks", and absurd laws, and policy's that cause more harm than good. The only thing the government does for the people is tax the hell outa them, and remove any unnecessary "rights" that might interfere with "proper" population management in the future.  We have a new "universal law", that says,"anything the government don't like is illegal". It saves time, cause it eliminates the need for costly trials, and we now have an "asset forfeiture" law so if the government wants any of your stuff, they can just take it.|`|Ij26w9ataa	I am not an American. But I do know that corruption is universal. America is no exception. The only difference is that they don't call it bribe. There are some sophisticated terms instead. Lobbying and Contributions are the two most prevalent.|`|jgRRsG8Daa	While bribing in the US may not as blatant and unashamed as in India,  probably it is more sophisticated.Recently there were two cases,one of Sen.Ted Stevens of Alaska and another of Gov.Blagojevich.In the former the Senator was found guilty by a court of law while in the latter  the Governor was impeached by the Senate and removed from office.  But if found guilty,the punishment is very severe unlike India where people like Shibu Soren and some Marandi even after they admitted to accepting hefty bribes,were held innocent by no less an authority   than the Supreme Court of India.|`|8bWBLysaaa	corruption prevelent everywhere but you feel it only when you are pinched.In an  economically drained country like india where poverty is at the peak that is itself becomes a cause for corruption. our govt are beggers thay bargain even for paying the defence.that is state of affairs. ask chidabaram to go borders and spent one night ,if that bastard comes back alive he willunderstand the pains of a soliders.it is not like taking suitcases and switching on sides.|`|KHeR3hGIaa	Generally not, no.    Bribes are illegal, both for those offering and those accepting a bribe, and it's always possible that you're being set up, so even if you did offer a bribe, the odds are very good that official you offered it to would either decline it or turn you in.    Around here, rather than paying bribes, you pay your lawyer to cut through the red tape it seems :)  (and I'm guessing that bribes would be cheaper.)|`|AA12370001	Nope.|`|NS9yqfT6aa	Individuals generally do not have enough influence to sway government officials, however large businesses do have the resources available to influence parts of our government... we don't really call it "bribing", but in reality, it is a form.|`|AA12016333	i am not an american. however, i think that under the head lobbying, they spend much. if it is true, it is nothing else than bribing.
mZi7R0Enaa	Yes but it was also another *opportunity* for BO to hurl himself into the spotlight, a place he holds near and dear!|`|tDZMJue9aa	more campaigning to keep his followers blind|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Yes.  What did he say that he didn't already say except he quit bashing the economy and Bill Clinton had to tell him to do that.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	This is what the messiah does - he reads crap off a teleprompter.  Sheeple drink Kool-Aid and cheer wildly.|`|B7qO5CsYaa	There has been some grumbling even from his staunchest sheep, he's got to keep them under that old black magic spell.|`|LMPK5WBaaa	Heck.... he was all over the road like a bad haircut...I was like... <br>  <br>  Humm....which problem is he gonna fix first ...|`|UzRijICuaa	Yes.  His handlers told him to speak positively and upbeat in order to foster a sense of renewed hope and of course he did as he was told.

Some are better than others in doing that, of course.|`|4f79340641baff06271767646a480530aa	It was to keep the Democrats in a trance. Too many are waking up to the fact that the working class got screwed in the stimulus package.|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	My gut tells me it was to pull the chains of Harry and nancy to remind them who he thinks is in charge, just to keep them in line.  The normal people never even bothered?|`|HobgsxXCaa	Just another Sheeple crumb, gota keep them gobbling up the BS to sucker them into Socialism.|`|a5wh1mKzaa	yes  it  was  nitrous  to  fuel  their  thinking
hwFbLhD3aa	Well, seeing as how Obama and this Congress are not as economically "gifted" as Bush and the 103rd (I think it was the 103rd? probably not heehee) It would have a very adverse effect. Despite the standstill caused by 9/11, Bush still managed to turn it around into some of the highest economic growth periods ever.|`|CD1T7gaXaa	We may have a bad economy, but we still have plenty of first rate weapons. The American response is usually to retaliate in a big way, which of course costs a lot of money. <br>  What I don't understand is why we aren't using oil from Iraq to pay off the war debt and help our economy. Instead we got $4.00+ a gallon gas. and inherited a huge national debt.<br>  Well I guess if we don't want to be reimbursed for things, another 911 type attack would probably throw us into a depression.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	the purpose of the 911 attack was to break our economy, which is why they chose the world trade centers,,,,,<br>  <br>  so, who do you think won|`|nLpctnwgaa	it would be very bad.  Be ready just in case.|`|ujIinLzGaa	It depends on what country it came from.  If it came from Iraq or Afghanistan, we could just keep doing what we are doing.  If it came from somewhere else, it would be very bad.<br>  <br>  Be ready.  You never know.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	the attack only destroyed people, planes and buildings; the response is what destroyed all the rest. "They" cannot take us down but how we answer will decide our fate. If the man who spoke last night had been in the whitehouse on 9/11/01 he would have said many the same things GWB did, the difference is that he would have actually gone after AlQaeda and made getting off foreign oil a priority not tried to secure a foothold in an oil rich country.|`|deb8ebd3bb2b5195a0f012a0a8d6fb42aa	With all the touchy-feely wimps in Washington, I imagine there would be a tidal wave of urine coming from this gutless congress, Repubs and Dems included. They don't have the fortitude to handle it. Hold on !!!|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Well, I remember the country rallying together after the attacks, we put aside our differences to band together and help each other. Too bad it didnt last very long.|`|d76Mz5c0aa	its would be very bad and i would get to kick some a$$
RlZ0d70Baa	do you mean the fact that the kids name is Sky Walker, as in (Luke) Sky Walker from Star Wars?|`|ujIinLzGaa	That the perp's name is Sky Walker?
hik6nWzkaa	Its treason plain and simple.<br>  If this guy comes back and attacks the US Obama should be tried and convicted for it.|`|KsMLHzbzaa	DID HE ADMIT THIS WHEN HE WAS GETTING WATERBOARDED.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Thank you liberals.|`|oAWEcd5Qaa	Repaying campaign debts.|`|TzkV8Ivraa	Obama's goal. <br>  to release his buddies, who hate Americas way of life as much as he does.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	The charges were dropped against him in October--when George W. Bush was president.|`|uNZtYvwHaa	Obama is frantically dancing to an unseen piper.|`|etcMARCAaa	If he admitted to all those things what do you think the chances are he was being water boarded when he did?  If he was then his admission is worthless.  If you water board someone you can make them admit to anything.  Even if they are guilty as sin you can't honestly convict them of a crime where the only evidence is their admission derived from torture. <br>  Nor can you lock someone up forever if you can't convict them of a crime.  But if they are guilty then you could release them and watch them.  They will lead you right to others who are out to get you.  At this point they will probably do that even if they are innocent. So you let one "terrorist" that is fully "tagged" go and find 10 more you didn't know about.  Or you can keep him forever and accpet being called a tyrant who locks people up without a trial or convict them unfairly and take the same title.  What would you do?|`|AA11765933	not much and sending nearly a billion dollars to Gaza which will eventually reach Hamas does not make much sense either.  A much better idea to aid the people of Gaza would be to send money to the United Nations.

If he stops the oil, auto, and corn subsidies, that'll put the country over the top. Blackwater alone accounts for $100.000-$200,000  each. Imagine how much health care that money would do instead. Might even move us out of 37th place in the world. The average US citizen spends $7,900 a year in health care, and the leading  cause of death in this country is health care.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	He doesn't count letting my tax cuts under Bush expire.|`|nLpctnwgaa	yes, that SCHIP bill really hit the poor smokers.|`|TzkV8Ivraa	Any individual who hears a democratic politicians state they are not going to raise taxes and believes them need their head examined.<br>         Democrats are for high taxes for everyone who has a O.K. to good job. <br>      EVERYONE.|`|t74KHpcsaa	Since when did the president have the power to raise state taxes? <br>  This question is lopsided and bad attempt at trying to tear down a brilliant man.

The key word is SAID.  Lets see what he does.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Good point.  He was talking income tax.  That leaves out a lot of other taxes and fees.<br>  <br>  *|`|f917ecaa58105d18c93396f2c027b772aa	I believe that's what I heard.|`|e0HbdRNMaa	I believe Obama said 95% of Americans would get a tax cut. Even that is incorrect.  He is only referencing income tax not other taxes imposed or loss of deductions.  If your tax is lowered but you get hit by AMT and that increases your tax payment - he is still correct because you were in a lower bracket.
0nZHAaQDaa	It sure is and I have seen a whole lot of liberal racism, according to libs I am supposed to be a out of work hard core liberal democrat because I am American Indian!|`|nLpctnwgaa	yes it is|`|AA11614944	You would think that it would but, but apparently it is not.

Barack wrote 2 books about how bad being half white is.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Yes,...<br>  <br>  But I think the rules are it's only racist if its against a liberal.

But at least george spoke his own words not a play writer like Obama uses.when will he articulate on how he is going to start reviving our country. He is lousy at this job and you all know it but since he is articulate I guess that doesn;t matter. If you give a good articulate speech then it doesn't matter how much we lose in this spending spree he's going on. But it's not so bad when he's not using his money .|`|AA11593971	What? Again with this question!<br>  <br>  Bush was an awful speaker and while not a great speaker, Obama is definitely better than Bush IN THAT RESPECT. But I will remind you that there have been many horrible leaders in the world that were very articulate... and they hid behind their ability to sway a crowd to hide their true selves and intentions... until it was too late. So don't expect me... or any thinking person... to get all wobbly kneed just because Obama can turn a phrase... albeit often interspersed with "uhs" and "ums."|`|SkWzsnuxaa	I think it is sad that every time President Bush spoke and he is a well spoken man, idiots attacked and belittled him while every time President Obama speaks he is praised as a great orator rather than treated with the same disdain.

He can make a pile of sh!t sound good. But a pile is still a pile no matter how many flowers you wrap it in.|`|EdnQBmxZaa	Content is more important than delivery.  It is not all that difficult to deliver a speech that someone else wrote from a teleprompter.  Americans are eager for reassurance.  Obama is more than happy to fulfill that need while he systematically destroys our democracy.  Bush did do some controversial things, and he did seem to be absent during the early days of this economic downturn, but he never sought to take away our individual liberties.  Don't be fooled by political rhetoric.  In this case, the solution Obama is proposing is far worse than the problem.|`|LTNLIT98aa	After a President with Balls--isn't it depressing to see one without any?<br>  <br>  obama is about as articulate as Biden is capable of being taken seriously--or his wife..<br>  <br>  obama can't even get into a helicopter--and walks into windows--and except for ten thousand--"uh---huhhmm..'duhh's" I guess to his fans that's close to articulate--NOT.<br>  <br>  he's retarded--and looks it.<br>  <br>  I miss having a MAN for president...that I agree with...|`|AA11614944	yes, it is easy for obama to read a teleprompter, take away the teleprompter and he turns into obam-uh.

5axNEp8jaa	The 6 million figure was a stipulation of the Nuremberg trial, Henry H Jackson the presiding Judge was called into a New York hotel by several Jewish lawyers and told there would be no exceptions regarding the trial to this number.At this trial documents in the defence of the accused were witheld or destroyed,the Russians got an excemption from its war crimes and the 6 million was simply a relative number.It was a show trial that implanted the 6 million figure.<br>  The Germans did take meticulous records but none exist that record the killing of Jews, After the war there were many order documents lying around which could have been forged,But yet no one has ever produced a Document ordering genocide. The commandant of Austwich was tortured to an inch of his life for a confession that wasnt true<br>  The alleged mass murders did not get going until 1942 after the wannasee conferance that means 2 Million people had to be killed on an industrial basis every year. It would just be too physically impossible. the Book 'The dissolution of European jewry' cant remember the author argues that most of the 6 million were absorbed in the new Soviet Union/Eastern Europe after the war. There are an estimated 200-300 thousand Holocaust survivors alive today,given the rate of natural death of other survivors of say 5-10% per year since 1945 on the figure of 200k is 600,000 people so their were 1,000,000 survivors at least? It would be mathematically impossible or the Germans were not very good at extermination Its now been estimated that 300,000 to 500,000 died in the camps many deaths caused by cholera and other epidemics when the allies bombed supply lines and railroads.<br>  Many of the photos of bodies cannot be verified as holocaust victims, many are POW, Germans themselves and of course Jews|`|882aadf45b04a15ccacc11c27555a716aa	6.000.000 Jews was not the reported death total in the camps.

But those killed in the Death camps were the only ones we can actually prove. Hundreds of Jews were murdred in the polish Ghettos. When Hitler invaded Russia, it is alleged that over 2 million Jews, Gypsys, and others were murdered by the SS death squads, as the Germans advanced into Russia.

You could go to mexico to get dental work because it is a whole lot cheaper to get dental work there. If the immigrants were smart, they would make their money here and take it home to spend it.    Lucky for us, they are spending it here.     You said that dentist seeing illegals are working for some people you know. Maybe those people you know could offer you some extra work so you can afford the dentist, too.     Or maybe you can find a dentist who accepts payments.

AA11916920	Exactly.  I mean honestly.  Why do people and the media make it out like Gitmo is a torture camp?  They make it seem that is all that is done daily is the torture and water-boarding of prisoners.<br>  Did it happen?  Yes.  It was isolated incidents and against specific personnel, not everyone.<br>  It has since stopped and don't you think world organizations would have done something a long time ago if this were the case.<br>  As far as what the media reports from the prisoners themselves, are you kidding me?  Ask anyone in prison and they will tell you they are innocent, just like an inmate will say they are torturing them.<br>  <br>  Here is their definition of torture and abuse.

The Defense Department review also recommends that high value and violent detainees be allowed to pray and have recreation time in groups of three, the official said.<br>  <br>  Several detainees have claimed in court documents that they were tortured and subjected to inhumane treatment in the military prison at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay. Most of the complaints concern the early years of the facility, after then-President George W. Bush determined that “minimum standards for humane treatment” spelled out in the Geneva Conventions “did not apply to al Qaeda or Taliban detainees,” according to a Senate Armed Services Committee report issued in December.<br>  <br>  I'm glad they tortured those responsible for 9/11 and the beheading of our soldiers.|`|sTSBk9jhaa	To answer the second, they got a scoop.

Shifting the tax burden onto the people who make the investments which grow the economy is nothing more than: ' trickle up poverty.'<br>  <br>  And it would also add fuel to the growing resentment of those people who consider themselves the 'taxpaying class.'  The people who pay most of the tax burden (30% of the taxpayers are responsible for 70% of the tax burden) are already seeing the US as composed of two groups of people: 'Taxpayers' and 'Freeloaders.'|`|Q7ovix19aa	No.  It's Obamean.

AA10388256	I agree with Edna and Playgirl. To them visually Jindal represents that the GOP is diverse but they really are not at all. They are 99% wealthy middle-age-to-older white males and their followers. No offense to wealthy middle-age-to-older white males at all but that's what the GOP is  and that is what they are trying to hide by putting these people on the air. <br>  It would be like the congressional Black Caucus having a white woman do their response because it was the politically correct thing to do instead of putting someone up that is representative of their main body of members. Dems in society truly do represent diversity and a diverse way of thinking thus the diverse crowds at Obama's speeches. <br>  <br>  People are not fooled by Jindal or Palin puppets. All one had to do is ride around on election time and see who had the McCain bumper plates. I bet you would be hard pressed finding one minority. That is the GOP's problem. They are living politicing in a 1983 Reagan America instead of what America is now. Repubs are a dying breed. No one wants to talk about tax cuts and banning gay marriage when people can't eat and their cars are worth more than their houses - especially when republican CEO's control everything in the financial sector and get bonuses the size of NBA contracts. All the cuts they propose will go from the bottom up. Meaning the poor and minorities will get hit first and the wealthy will just cut jobs and continue to live high on the hog. Bye bye Rush & Co. No one is buying Jindal or Palin or any other minority puppet they put up there. They have been exposed.

6OLiuM9Gaa	I can only speak about the Navy... and even that information is dated.    With a BA you can enter as an E-3. This gives you six months to a year advantage over those without the education.    People will tell you to go for an officer program. They seem to think that life as officer is a bowl of cherries. I don't think they know what they're talking about.    I enlisted with a BA in math at age 20. I didn't pursue an officer program because I didn't know if I wanted to make a commitment. When it came time for me to extend for E-6, somebody dusted off my degree and recommended me for OCS. I took advantage of the opportunity and retired at 45.    Being an officer isn't all that civilians and enlisted personnel seem to think. The pay's a little higher, and maybe there are a few more perks, but there's a whole lot more responsibility and stress. And it seems sometimes, especially as a junior officer, you don't have enough authority to meet your responsibilities.    Also, starting on the enlisted track, one gradually breaks into management. Ones management skills are observed, evaluated and tested... before he's given more. Less so for an officer. An officer is expected to take command. In my experience, often the officer isn't enough of a manager to handle the stress, the responsibility, or the authority.    Finally, starting on the enlisted track gives one the advantage that if one becomes an officer, one knows what one looks for in a "good" officer before going that route.    Boot Camp's Boot Camp. It doesn't make any difference what your level of education is... or your age. The latter will be a disadvantage in that your husband will be trying to keep up with kids five years younger than he is. I'll tell you it's not easy, but it's easier at 24 than at 66. Your husband's age and education could also be an advantage. He may be given some "leadership" position in his company as a recruit petty officer. It's an honor, and not a promotion. He doesn't get any more pay. I don't know if it even appears anywhere in his record.    Addendum:    For the guy with a BBA in accounting who bashed your degree in Psychology, When I retired from the Navy I got my MA in Math and then my DBA in management. I switched to a business major because I got tired of studying. ;-)|`|3WYcPsm4aa	If he enlists.. he will go in as an E-3, but after that he'll progress through ranks like anyone else.    Job... nope... no special considerations for having your degree in a specific field.  Basic....EVERYONE goes to basic!  Whether it is enlisted basic, or OCS, it's still basic training of one form or another, and yes he will have to be successful in the PT standards set for everyone!    Best bet..... go commissioned!  Have him speak with an officer recruiter.  It will be an enlisted person, but they have special knowledge and training in dealing with folks who want to enter the officer corp.    Good luck!!|`|AOaHaRvBaa	Yes, there are several more options for him with a degree.    He can enter the Army directly as a Specialist (E-4).  He also may qualify for college option Officer Candidate School (OCS).    Either route, he will have to go to Basic Training.  If he wants to continue as enlisted, he will proceed from Basic to the Advanced Individual Training (AIT) for his job.      If he chooses OCS, he'll go straight from Basic to OCS.  Once he graduates, he'll be commissioned as a Second Lieutenant (O-1).  From there, he'll complete at least two more courses, then proceed to his unit.    Follow the link to the military pay scale below.  These numbers are only the monthly salaries.  They do not include other benefits.    http://www.militaryfactory.com/military_...|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	I think he can go in with the option for OCS in his contract.  With a bachelor's he should be able to get that, or at least go for a warrant officer position.  If he thinks he'd like flying he could try out for flight school.  Yes, you rank higher with an education.|`|LWzrCu5caa	With a bachelors degree he can be an officer.  Officers do not "enlist" they are commissioned.   He does not have the credentials yet to be a Psychologist so forget about that.   He would have to try to get a commission as a line officer and would go in as a Second Lieutenant.   Of course he would have to do all that "military" stuff but could possibly get into personnel management.       If he gets his masters in Psychology he can become a Clinical Psychologist in the service.   That would put him under the heading of medical personnel rather than line.       Enlisting would not pay near as much and if money is a problem,  I would not recommend it.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Look into OCS and be an officer.  Yes you will go in with a higher rank if you enlist with a degree but the pay is much better as an officer.  And the lifestyle is much better.|`|yFYFZRlFaa	He should look at the officer corps.  With a degree, he should look at OCS.  I believe he can get that in his contract, but not sure.  I would push them pretty hard on this.  Don't just enlist, with the hope that you might get into OCS.  Get it in your contract.        There is also the Warrant Officer track.      The degree has real value in the military.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	See if his recruiter can sign him up to be eligible for OCS (get it in writing) as soon as possible. Ideally it would have been nice if he went ROTC while in college but still OCS is a good move.    Yes he will have to go to basic training and all of that.|`|AUB1ieOHaa	I agree, look into OCS!!

I think Blair did make a tentative 'apology' a while ago but nothing substantial.<br>  <br>  The case of the Irish famine is well pointed out by Curious too. There was no shortage of food. People starved because the English Lords and bosses wouldn't allow ordinary people to eat the other food that was being produced in Ireland.<br>  <br>  Many of the problems we see in the so called 3rd world country's are as a direct result of colonialism and imperialism. Just look at a map of the African continent. All those straight lines were made with a ruler after WWI as the victorious powers carved it up...regardless of traditional tribal areas. Just look at the slaughter in Rwanda and Burundi!<br>  <br>  It's about time the Western leaders and post-colonial nations came clean and admitted that imperialism was a crime against humanity!<br>  <br>  Incidentally, British workers demonstrated against slavery and took direct action against slave ships while the British ruling class supported the Southern states in the US civil war.|`|jtPzPhHCaa	And when, exactly, are the African nations going to apologise for the enslavement of over 1 million Europeans in the 15th & 16th centuries.

This was private donations, not taxpayers' money. Its route to Hain was shady in the extreme, but it did not come from the taxpayer.

KKH9y0ECaa	Gordon Brown should have called an election, making dodgy deals in Islington Restaurants is not democracy, and if the system needs to be changed to prevent this kind of behaviour then so be it.  Indeed the British people now have acquired an executive presidency by stealth.<br>  <br>  People in Britain vote for a political party based on leadership as it dictates appointments to Cabinet and Government and therefore dictates the direction of a political party. A Prime Minister for this reason alone should hold a general election rather than seek unopposed Coronation, and I am positive if the boot had been on the other foot and the Conservatives had done this, then the Labour Party would have been up in arms.<br>  <br>  The fact that Tony Blair and New Labour constantly indicated that he would serve a full term third term before the last election also shows how dishonest and full of spin new Labour are. We also await other such Labour promises as a national referendum on the Single Currency, as well as a Referendum on the European Constitution set forth in the Lisbon Treaty, both have now been forgotten about, and the EU Constitution is being brought in via the backdoor.<br>  <br>  The fact is Gordon Brown should have called an election for the sake of Democracy if nothing else.<br>  <br>  Thankfully Brown no longer has much leeway, and an election will have to be called by Mid 2010.|`|g8EViy1Raa	We get ballot papers with names of those standing in your constituency.

PBq7ODPzaa	They are the same as the Army's Physical Fitness standards.  2 mile run, push-ups and sit-ups (not crunches).    They are based on your age.  You can see the standards here;    http://www.apft-standards.com/    Look at the column for your age group, a passing score is 60 in each event with an overall minimum to pass being 180 points.    For instance, a 17-21 year old male needs to do 42 P/U, 53 S/U and run 2 miles in 15:54.    The Push-up and sit-up events are 2 minute events.  You have that long to do as many as you can.    A word of advice, if you are prep'ing for basic you need to push yourself to do the best you can.  Set the highest standard for yourself.  The more physically fit you are in basic the easier it is.|`|Ln5XNno3aa	They are the same as the National Guard and Active components.

w6B0T7pvaa	It's relatively simple.<br>  <br>  First of all, the budget deficit is largely inherited from Bush.  That's $1 trillion of it.  Some portions of this will continue (remember, Obama isn't pulling the troops out of Iraq -- he's phasing them out, and putting more emphasis on Afghanistan).<br>  <br>  Second, the stimulus, another $800 billion, is a one-time expense.  Though there will be continued spending here, the deficit will naturally decrease in these regards.  Though the spending will continue over the course of the next 5 to 10 years for the sake of economic stimulation, it will be significantly less each year (with an especially significant drop-off in spending around 2013).<br>  <br>  Third, a lot is being done to make government processes more efficient and less costly overall.  This includes trimming spending in certain areas of government, and making investments now that will reduce spending in government industries like health-care (i.e., hospitals) in years to come.<br>  <br>  Fourth, part of the agenda regarding budget and taxation involves cutting out loopholes that are allowing major businesses to evade taxes by registering overseas, while still operating in the U.S.  Various loopholes like these will be closed (according to Obama and his administration), leading to more significant revenue for the U.S. government.<br>  <br>  Fifth, taxes for those in the $250,000+ income bracket will increase from about 35% to about 39% (this isn't finalized, just preliminary estimates).<br>  <br>  Sixth, Obama is going to allow some tax breaks that Bush approved for big business to lapse.  This will, again, increase U.S. government revenue.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are other factors as well, but these are the major ones.  By 2013, Obama intends to reduce the annual deficit from it's current 1.75 trillion to about a third of it's current amounts.  And analysts (more or less) agree that the numbers work out -- even if there are gray areas yet to be fully explored.<br>  <br>  Rob - <a href="http://www.utahliberal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.utahliberal.com</a>|`|ST7WcWfsaa	It's easy..<br>  <br>  1.

There are many good things that happen when people start focusing on taking care of their health. Just think about it cause you answer is so easy. Do you know what Clinton did to bring us from deficit to surplus. Ask or research about that.

Governor Jindal choses to refer to himself as Bobby - again, whatever.  <br>  <br>  Please focus on issues, not semantics.|`|AA10313141	They also called him Hussein Obama, but don't start referring to him by  a name he doesn't go by anymore just to put emphasis on him being a different race.  It's a dirty tactic when Republicans do it and all the worse when Democrats do it.|`|UzRijICuaa	Who knows.  Was it Barry or Barack?    Whatever works I suppose.   Bobby Jindal has been called Bobby since he was a very young child, Barry was Barry until he was told it would help him to sound "different"..(IMAGE, it's all about IMAGE)|`|9ogPeXWJaa	If America even lets an towel head run for election. I'm  moving to Canada. Anyways.. Its will be Obama. No doubt... he'll get two turns. He still has a lot to prove... but I have faith in him. Something I couldnt say about a president since I've been alive.|`|6yQqtbiIaa	Jan 20th 2013 it will be President Jindal. I'd rather Piyush Jindal than Barack Hussein Obama.

t7KHxE2Iaa	I agree. He didn't really even offer another idea, just criticized Obama's. People are losing their jobs, homes and hope for the future. I think we're all looking for something a good bit more constructive from our representatives than what Bobby Jindal delivered.<br>  <br>  And yes, Republicans had the power in every branch until 2006 when the Dems took congress, but even then the Democrats didn't have the majority they have now. Bush may not have the power to make laws, but he can veto them. Liberal legislation didn't have a chance of passing until last month.|`|6cm6MB66aa	If you ask me it all depends on the leader and how well he can get reps and Dem's to work together .Another words if he has a good plan that helps one and all Bush was just to cocky and made allot of bad decisions that's why he couldn't Control congress . Both sides are going to point the finger at each other when things go wrong . They do that to save there jobs . The first stimulus went to the banks which was another of Bushes failures . Most of the money went to the CEOs as bonus and to pay for the bankers bad decisions and lost investments corporate jets all the goodies for the rich . The reps made out like bandits . Its was like the vaults where left open and a free for all . They still cant account for it . Bad government was to blame . As far as we know bush is sitting on a Mountain of cash|`|nz8U5rNaaa	You are wrong the Republicans have not had control of congress for the last 8 years. they create the plan and send it to the President. All of congress all parties are responsible. You say you are neither party so try to stay independent and look and see they all have done this. this is common sense but peoples blind loyalty to a party keeps them from seing it.|`|ad2faoKcaa	People still haven't come to grips with Obama being president and being as such, some will try to make him look bad by any means necessary. The governor of Louisiana is an idiot !<br>  <br>  The 9th ward is still in disarray and this idiot is saying he doesn't want bailout money. They received approximately $170B dollars for katrina clean up and rebuilding yet the 9th ward remains in disarray. I don't get that !|`|VBHOiIBlaa	Lol, do a little fact checking...<br>  <br>  Republicans only had control for the FIRST 2 years of Bush's Term.<br>  The middle 4 of his Term were pretty 50/50 between Repubs and Democrats.<br>  Then the last 2 years of his term the Democrats had control.<br>  <br>  Notice how things got worse and worse the more control the democrats got?<br>  <br>  Simple to google who had control of the senate from 2000-2008
7PFgHRFaaa	Yeah. Let's see Piyush Jindal's b.c. Is he really American or a terrorist?  Does he really love America? Now the cons want to look pass race.  They are just using Jindal and Steele to try to win the next election.  They harass and called the First Family every name in the book but a child of God.  What are hypocrites. %|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	When he runs for president, he should (like anyone else) provide it to a board that verifies he meets the constitutional qualifications.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Thank you for the good laugh. I'm sure those on the right don't even get your point. I can also promise you that, if he runs, you won't actually be seeing anyone on the left making this demand.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	lol..<br>  watch how many say that "well, at least HE would show his". <br>  And no matter what, the legal concept that a candidate has NO OBLIGATION to show anyone his private records... <br>  will still go over their little heads. <br>  Berg plants the idea that (1) grandma in a foreign language on a video is more "fact" than the State of Hawaii and (2) any idiot walking down the street has authority to dispute your citizenship. <br>  Both are false. <br>  Obama (and the courts) are following the law. Jindal will be subject to exactly the same law. <br>  But how long does it take the conspiracy nuts to figure out that BERG doesn't have a clue to what the law IS??|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	I demand to know all the indoctrination and rituals he may have been exposed to as a child; all the people he may have associated with, did he attend any religious schools or ceremonies?|`|qRnXasisaa	very valid question I would like to see it too.. and all of those questioned Obama's birth certificate   can see where we are coming from|`|WD6uLJxvaa	When he runs for president then ask him.

d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	"Do nothing" is misleading.  It means that the federal government needs to do nothing.  Although they actually first need to do a lot to cut back on government size from decades of not doing nothing that put us in this position.<br>  <br>  Things do need to be done, just not by the federal government.  State governments need to make doing business in their states more appealing.  People in general need to stop spending beyond their income. We need to stop thinking of debt as an asset.  Loans should not be able to be sold beyond very limited options. It should be rare that a loan be sold and certainly not for reasons of profit.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	What about the Bold Far reaching Attitude of the New Deal...what a Bust.

lPwdDpxgaa	It just goes to show you that when the ultra-rich globalists pick someone, they can get away with everything and it doesn't matter.

This is not the time to continue with the rhetoric that has been the cornerstone of GOP politics for the last 8 years.  It would do well for them to consider that the efforts of the Democrats can and most likely will work and that if their negative endorsements continue, they will be the ones without a chair when the music stops.  I really think they should just apologize and shut up if they're not going to work and play constructively with others.

But, What about Non-violent offenders that are serving time. Do you think those individuals should be locked up and tossed away without ever being afforded the opportunity to better themselves. Maybe they have a god given talent to write. But, I would rather help the individual who is sincerely trying to make themselves a better person before they went to prison in the first place.

If i have a broken arm I dont want to wait 3 days to have an xray taken.  If it becomes socialized they set the appointments for you and sometime it can even be months.  Plus the cost of everything will at least triple because it is the gov`t that will be paying for it and in turn we`ll pay with it through taxes...meaning yes Taxes will go up.<br>  <br>  Why would you believe any of the Propaganda that he puts <br>  out?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You havent paid for your healthcare yet because you probably dont pay for taxes yet.  In reality you pay for your health care plus your neighbors healthcare plus that guy down your street who you dont like, yes you pay for his healthcare too through TAXES.  YOU think you can really get something, even healthcare, for nothing? Either you havent started paying taxes yet or you are naive and paying taxes for things you dont even know about.  I have friends in Sweden and it has taken them a week to get their prescription, they were amazed that we can get ours in an hour.  They have tons of horror stories of their healthcare system, but their ppl just roll over and accept it.  If your healthcare system is so great why do so many Canadian Doctors come to the US to practice medicine?  Maybe it has to do with the lack of profit from medicine in Canada...why do Canadians cross the border and come to the US for healthcare?  Why are they leaving such a great system?  Can you please answer that?  <br>  <br>  <br>  First off you havent answered my question posted to you.  If American healthcare is so bad then why are the medical schools loaded with foreign students?  It certainly isnt cheaper to go to medical school here.  They are learning in the healthcare system they will be working in.  I have friends who got accepted to Med schools in both places, obviously it wasnt their first choice but rather an option to fall back on.  It`d be a lot easier and cheaper for me to go to medical school in Canada or Mexico than it would for me to go to school here in the US.

qnqAENTEaa	Hi FreeRunnerOfManchester, thanks for clearing that up.<br>  <br>  The M16 has been around for longer so some could argue it's more battle proven. To counter this the L85a2 has been involved in combat conditions continuously for the last 6 years so both are well versed.<br>  <br>  Although the length of the M16 is often viewed as a flaw, when using the bayonet this is actually an advantage as it gives the soldier the extra 'reach' in hand to hand fighting. In addition, the bayonet attachment on the M16 is generally viewed as better than that on the L85 variants. The latter surrounds the muzzle, getting very hot when the weapon is fired and resulting in the tip of the bayonet having a tendency to break off.<br>  <br>  The M16 is more versatile in design as it is modular, meaning that more or less any sighting system can be fitted along with torches, laser sights, UGL's etc. The L85a2 needs to be adapted to take different sighting systems other than the iron sights and the SUSAT.  To fit any additional kit to the L85a2 the front handgrip needs to be replaced.<br>  <br>  The L85a2 is bullpup, which is both an advantage and disadvantage. The main advantage the non-bullpup M16 has over a bullpup design like the L85a2 is its ability to be fired from both shoulders. This means that the soldier using it is able to aim his weapon around the left side of obstacles without exposing his body- a significant 'plus' when operating in built up areas.<br>  <br>  Weight and balance is another advantage the M16 holds over the L85a2. It is extremely light and well balanced, although balance can be argued as just what you get used to.<br>  <br>  The M16 is an extremely good weapon and one of the widely employed small arms in the world. When commenting on questions like this it's easy to forget that not too long ago the British Government were considering replacing the L85 system altogether in favour of an 'off the shelf' design like the G36. They chose a HK upgrade instead (probably because it was cheaper) which has turned an all but hopeless rifle (at least in reliability terms) into one of the most reliable weapons in the world. <br>  <br>  The US use the M16 because they adopted it years before any other such 5.56mm weapon was available and since then have adopted it continuously to keep it up to date and comparable with the best rifles available. It is accurate, reliable (relatively), versatile, easy to operate and light.<br>  <br>  To date, the trouble of replacing it has simply not been justified in the possible end results. Saying this, the US are currently looking for a new system to replace the M16 in the relatively near future.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	I was going to answer but your getting a bit surly.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	Ex Brit Army here.<br>  <br>  "now, i hear both are Bullpups" <br>  wrong, M16 is conventional design, SA80 is bullpup<br>  <br>  "and the SA-80 is shorter"<br>  Because it's a bullpup<br>  <br>  "more accurate, reliable" Arguable<br>  <br>  "ambidextrous (M16 isnt)"<br>  Wrong, M16 is ambidextrous, SA80 Isn't<br>  <br>  "and can be fired from pretty much any position"<br>  Can you tell me what position the M16 can't be fired from which the SA80 can be??<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think you either need to link to your sources or do more homework|`|z1UXptEmaa	"now, i hear both are Bullpups"<br>  <br>  After reading your first sentence.

Why dont you go look up the weapons you are talking about and then maybe go look up the definition of the term bullpup, because the M16 is not one.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	doesn't the SAS favour the M16 over the SA80?|`|5H8kjwHDaa	The SA-80 or L85 assault rifle was adopted for British army service in 1985, but in fact the design is much older than this. The 5.56mm SA80 was originally the 4.85mm IW which was first produced in 1973 as a prototype weapon for the NATO calibre trials. Adoption of the 5.56mm SS109 round saw the IW become the SA-80.<br>  <br>          When it was due for adoption many British Gun writers voiced concerns about the design, but these seem to have been politely ignored.<br>  <br>          It was during the Gulf War in 1991 that the mainstream press became aware of the malfunctions, jamming and reliability problems that the SA80 was prone to, including, apparently, a tendency to fire if dropped or struck on the muzzle.<br>        <br>           In 1997 the SA80 was dropped from NATO's list of approved weapons because it was having difficulty firing NATO approved ammunition reliably.<br>          <br>            Eventually the MOD admitted that something might be wrong. It is reported that the weapon has undergone 83 modifications over 18 years, but despite this in 2000 a contract of ￡80 million was paid to Hecker and Koch to put the army's SA80s right.|`|vp8806Eraa	i stole this answer !<br>  <br>  I've used both the a1 and the current a2 version of the SA80 (L85a1/2) and trained alongside those using the M-16a2 in both temperate and desert conditions. The 'old' version of the SA80 deserved its reputation, a stoppage with every magazine or so could be expected even in temperate climates but handles like a different weapon after H&K worked their magic.<br>  My experience with the M16 is that it suffers far more stoppages in the desert and is generally less accurate, although not by much. It is long and unweildly in comparison with the SA80. Even the LSW (the long barelled version of the SA80) is still shorter than the M16. The SA80 rifle is shorter than the M4 carbine family while maintaining a barrel length longer than the full length M16. On the other hand, the M16 is very light and can be fired from both shoulders, whereas the bullpup design of the SA80 limits it to a right shoulder fired weapon only. Some people claim that the M16 is better than the SA80 in OBUA (urban fighting) because of this ambidextruity, however, being so short the SA80 is easier to handle in confined spaces and is capable of automatic fire. Despite the fact that in British service the fully automatic capability of the SA80 would almost never be used in anything other than trench clearence drills, it is still a useful function. In design, each has its pro's and con's. The shortness of the SA80 is in most cases an advantage, but the length of the M16 makes it the more formidable when using the bayonet. While on the topic of the bayonet, a design flaw of the SA80's bayonet is that the handle surrounds the barrel and becomes hot after the weapon is fired and the tip of the bayonet can break off. Ultimately the latter problem is hardly an issue, although technically it contravenes the Geneva Convention. <br>  In reliability, I can state from personal experience that the SA80a2 is more reliable than the M16 (I have NEVER had a stoppage with my a2 personal weapon and have seen many with the M16a2). <br>  The most modern versions of the M16 are modular, which means that they can have various accessories bolted onto them dependant on the needs of various operations. Whereas the SA80 has the capability to have specialist equipment attached (Light Laser Module etc), it lacks the versatile modular nature of the M16.<br>  To sum up, The SA80 is shorter, more accurate, has fully automatic capability and is more reliable. The M16 is longer, modular, and lighter. Usually the choice comes down to a personal one.<br>  The old argument of the SLR vs. the SA80 is more of an debate over calibre than it is over the weapons systems themselves. I have little doubt the SLR is superior to the SA80a1 as a weapon system, but having not fired one I cannot compare it to the a2.

Wall Street can't be predicted too easily at the moment anyway.  People are trading on pure emotion.  Last week is a good example of that. On the word of a single administration official that it might be necessary to nationalize banks, the market went into free-fall.  Obama comes out later in the same day and says don't worry, we're not nationalizing and the market began to come back up.  More reassurance was offered by the administration yesterday and there was a gain for the day. Nobody is thinking of the overall long term success that the market has proven.

I think some people that were not his followers did find substance in his speech. His ratings are back up to 80% & that is because of the people who are uncertain & feel better when they listen to him. The CNN polls are the ones that were exactly right on election day so you can read some other polls if it makes you feel better than others are like you & can't see that Bush robbed us of almost a trillion dollars of money that Clinton handed him from the surplus. Then Bush ran up a debt that is almost a trillion dollars. Now Obama is investing the money to stimulate the economy & people like you can't see how this money is needed because Bush destroyed our economy & now we have to get people off of gov. assistance & back to work.

I personally have bought two rifles and some ammo in the last month. I'm not worried about our government protecting us.  I think a lot of sales are happening because those who want them think it might become more difficult to buy them.  I bought mine because the price was right.  Maybe eight years of Republican rule brought the price down?  I'm not a Republican or a Democrat.  I'm a Liberal.  The Democrats don't want to take your guns away.  They want to monitor those guns that aren't used for hunting.  Pistols and assault rifles are what need to be monitored.  I have an assault rifle.  The crazies out there think that we're going to revert to Nazi Germany where they made everyone register their guns so they would know who to take them away from.  Pistol and assault rifles should be registered.  I'd much rather have to register them and still be able to have them then to lose my right to have them altogether.  I mistrust the government more than 99.9% of the people out there because only a few people control what goes on.  If everyone got involved and gave a little, the country would be a lot better place.  Transparency and citizen involvement are what our government needs.<br>  <br>  I have my guns to protect me from the idiots who have been abusing the word "patriotism" since 9-11.  This country should be run the way the majority of it's people want it to be run.  If we are ever going to be a democracy we have to aspire to that.  We're not a democracy, never have been.  We're a republic, look it up.  It's right there on the original paperwork that started this country.  It's the right-wing zealots that want all of us to live like they think we should that worry me.  That's why I have my guns.  Steve Martin said it best "I believe that Ronald Reagan can make this country what it once was...a barren wasteland, covered in ice."  Keep pushing us back to the Stone Age.  That'll work.

Yet if he and the rest of the dems screw up they will still blame Bush.|`|AA10138269	Speech said one word- Optimism|`|SEwG8Yl4aa	That is part of it.<br>  <br>  The real theme of Obama's speech was that only the federal government can solve our nation's problems.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	Reagan turned the economy around in months without demonizing anyone.  "Leaders" in trouble need someone to demonize....Hugo Chavez has the USA, Ahmadenajhad has the USA, Obama has Bush.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	He didn't Bash bush one single time what are you talking about?  He was saying that he is changing some things from the past administration that  do not work.  He never mentioned Bush.  Even the Republicans stood for almost everything except the bailout.  Obviously they cooperate more than you think they do.  Dont throw out fictional percentages to sound like you know what your talking about either.  To those of us that follow politics closely you look very ignorant.|`|CD1T7gaXaa	The speech was very good and Obama is a charming fellow. Very spirit raising stuff and all that. Not that I believe a word of it, but it was very well done. <br>  Now about all that money Obama gave to rich folks while people were losing their jobs and their homes....|`|EdnQBmxZaa	Talk is cheap.  Anyone who was reassured by more political spin is minimizing the problems our nation faces.  Who will Obama blame when Hamas attacks Israel with the 900 million dollars he plans on sending them?  Who will he blame when the terrorists that he plans to release from GITMO kill more innocent Americans in the name of Jihad?  Those mistakes will belong solely to him.  Bush is gone.  Our politicians need to take responsibility for their own mistakes and seek to improve the state of our nation...less talk, more positive action!  We need to clean up Washington.|`|FpMCFvV5aa	The mistakes of the last 8 years will pale in comparison to the mistakes being committed in the next 4 years.

He can't go into any great details because there is so much to cover and he has to keep reiterating that they will not nationalize the banks, raise taxes (except for those fortunate enough to make $250k+/yr), keep the military strong, keep your guns etc. The Democrats ARE better because they believe that in this nation everyone deserves affordable and decent health care and education. <br>  Most Republicans don't care about this because they have health care and send their kids to private schools. <br>  He kept mentioning the last 8 years because of all the damage caused by Bush will cost a ton of money to fix. He will trim fat and apply it to areas of great importance.<br>  It was a very good speech.|`|wDC4VAdDaa	alright so we now know you didn't watch the speech.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	There are many people who support Obama who needed to hear the speech. CNN polls show his rating is up to 80% again & it was down to 60% before the speech so some people needed this clarity. CNN was so right with their polling on the election so if you look at others they are just tricking the reps. into false security which might be why they lost.

Bush bashed Clinton in his first term as well.  I didn't hear Obama bash bush.  He talked about the mistakes, which are proven mistakes.  If he can identify 2 trillion dollars in wasted spending thats pretty much saying there was bad mistakes being made.|`|AA11832068	Heck I lost count at around 10, and that was early on.

He can't help it, his brain has been wired to find the nearest target (whether it's valid or not), get a bunch of other hate and blame buddies to make him feel comfortable about going completely against common decency and a moral conscience that is screaming for a higher level of focus and analysis........... spout whatever rhetoric of blahblahness works for the naive and not so well grounded masses, get a speech writer who couldn't come up with a single new and creative idea if it swirled around his/her head and flashed on and off in bright florescent neon red for 8 minutes directly in front of his eyes........ dare to walk around like his brain is actually functioning properly......... show up and spew, spew, spew, blah blah blah blah-blah, wait for applause, spew, spew, spew some more, applause, walk away and THINK something constructive has been accomplished because his brown nosing, well paid "we think you're just great" fan club members are slobbering and gushing all over him. <br>  <br>  Obama really needs to go to some kind of healing seminar and get his brain cleared of all that hate and blame that works sort of "well" while we're in our adolescence, but really gets in the way when we're trying to be grownups with something truly worthwhile to offer those around us. Otherwise, he'll just continue to be a "grownup" with an adolescent clang-filled, brass strained twang wherever he goes, whatever he does, whoever he speaks with.|`|W0VL46gDaa	He is subliminally brainwashing more people into thinking he is the Almighty. <br>  Hes gotta knock others down to build himself up. sad.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	I thought President Obama was rather kind in the way he worded the references.

But this is not a problem.<br>  The problems, in Italy, are the link with  Mafia that Berlusconi have with the Mafia's Boss (Vittorio Mangano e Tanino Cinà) and private institution.<br>  If you are alert,you can see that if he make a Law governament (decreto legge), he make this  for the Mafia's interests only.<br>  The law promulgate by Silvio Berlusconi are scandalous and do the .....(How the english says)....    "conflitto di interesse"?. He make a law  for hiself !!! The law abot drug, the law about school (university and elementary),justice,Messina's  bridge, wire tapping (about Berlusconi and other Berlusconi's friends)  .....!!!<br>  In the Berlusconi's house (Arcore), near Milan, in the 1972, there was a Boss,Vittorio Mangano, but, the italian people don't know this because the paper and the television are all in his hands!!!<br>  Vittorio Mangano was an important cocaine pusher and came from Palermo, the city where there are all most important Mafia's members!<br>  Vittorio was a Calò(another boss) friend, Calò is (now) a Riina friend......and Riina is the most powerful man inside Mafia (in Italy is called "the boss of the boss") Riina lived in New York and now the italian judges have imprison him. <br>  Berlusconi is dangerous for all in Italy....but none say this at the world!!!<br>  I have write this answer with dictionary, I don't know if the grammar is right but I hope that you can understand what I say....this is important for all.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhOJc1JBpKI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhOJc1JBp...</a>|`|FSsl25SLaa	He's done good things and bad things for Italy - mostly for the student and young person he is an evil man. Like cutting University courses with 10 students or less - this is common sense.<br>  <br>  Yes, he changes the law for himself. He makes a priority of the arts and culture in Italy also, which is good for the perception abroad of the country. Also he brought stability into politics since the WW2 because before then there was no stable government. If you want stupid and arrogant, remember Bettino Craxi!<br>  <br>  Re: University - This is similar to Thatcher and the Unions in the 80's. Reforms including failure if the conduct is not satisfactory are needed, you cannot think that you can do anything that you want and still be respected? This is the first good point, second - cutting out classes with very very low attendance is a cost-cutting measure. As far as I'm aware, the schools are state-run and state-run institutions are always a waste of money. The same thing would happen if the education sector was put in private hands (actually it would be better privatized as there could be more choice of course, albeit at a price). I know several students in favour of these changes infact.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, I agree with you that Berlusconi is arrogant - I don't like him changing laws for him to escape prosecution for corrupt practices & I don't like him making remarks about other nation's leaders. Furthermore I am so against the law preventing euthanasia, despite indication not to pass (and it angers me that the church has so much influence in Italy, and Berlusconi allows it). But we are all allowed our opinion.....ma forse sei un po' piu giovane di ricordare Craxi e Tangentopoli, la sinistra è pericolosa! <br>  Good day!

8dc5NMexaa	If they had dropped charges, the latest docket entry would have stated "dismissed."  "Removal from trial docket" simply means that they have knocked the case off of the docket for the days that it was previously set, and at some later date, they will reassign a trial date.

T8nap2Pnaa	actually you have to apply for a re-entry permit in the US, but you can have it sent to you overseas, unlike Advance Parole. that doesn't apply to your situation but with Advance Parole that has to be approved and in your hands before you leave. In your case, you have until Jan 10 to return and apply although sooner would be better. Your green card statis remains valid up to 12 months after you leave the US without a re-entry permit. one day over though, you'd lose it. However, if that should happen your husband could file a new petition for  you overseas.|`|2YLjd9uSaa	As others have said, it's too late to apply for a Re-entry Permit.

You can not get a re-entry permit prior to having a green card. I believe what you applied for was an "advanced parole" which would allow you to exit and re-enter the US prior to receiving a green card. You may want to talk to a lawyer about this. 1 year outside the US without a re-entry permit is grounds for revocation.|`|Maw2rtKZaa	If you have a green card, you can reenter the US up to a year later without many hassles.   However, if you are going to be gone longer, up to 2 years, you need a re-entry permit.  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, you have to apply for a reentry permit while you are in the United States. <br>  <br>  So, I would come back to the US before your year is up, apply for a re-entry permit while you are there.

All the blacks can get whatever they want for their 6 kids and getting brand new housing.  But the single white working woman cant get a dammmmmm thing! Somethings wrong. They are spending BILLIONS of OUR tax dollars to build these worthless people beautiful houses, that they are just going to run to shhhhittttt in a year or two and start slinging drugs out of.. and getting doors kicked in really soon! But there is still thousands of homes that are in rubble after the storm, but dont worry the blacks are getting new housing.. b/c they cry the loudest! Great job JINDAL!|`|0a3365e60ed6ac719c848e7eee088ff9aa	What can you expect from a Republican, if they are not placing the worst president in American history in the white house, they are soliciting gay sex in an airport bathroom, or having a creepy Indian version of Mr.Rogers talking to you like your a 1st grader.

I listen for substance & all I have ever heard from him is that he has been told what to say when he speaks then her repeats the same thing over & over. I have never heard him say anything of value. I look for that value. He was on Meet the Press Sun. & if you can get a copy of that look for the value in what he said & you will see it isn't there. So I have not ever heard him speak any better than he did last night & that was horrible. He is giving the dems so much to give back to the reps. for all the put downs they dished out. He is giving SNL a good thing to use against him. When I tried to warn reps. about him they denied he was so bad. I would love to see the reps. come up with someone who has made up a story (McCain) or has an extreme religion or boys in their closet. Yet, I was blamed for saying Jindal was not going to put reps. at an advantage. People are laughing at him calling him Shaggy from Scooby Do, I saw him as Barney Fife from Andy Griffen. I have heard he looked like he smoked pot before he came on or he looked like Dopey from the 7th dwarfs. This is not the democrats part we are giving back what we have been given cause we used to be so nice but we need to balance things out & the reps are bringing it on themselves. I look forward to people seeing Michael Steele. He will made Jindal not look as bad cause he is another one who has nothing to say but he puts people down to the highest level I have ever seen in an adult.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	Piyush Jindal made a big fool of himself and GOP...thank you 'bobby'...

AA11206283	You need to hire an American Real estate lawyer. They will know the  best way to petition for a zoning variance; and some things like set back lines may be grandfatherred in and legal when done; but not legal for new work. Building permits are public records; any good researcher should be able to go into Zoning and permits and copy them; or photograph them for reproduction (But I've never heard of a legitimate request for a copy of a BP being refused for a fee). Blueprints are not usually public records.<br>  <br>  As for the "2 wrongs make it right": most zoning codes specifically state that other violations do not exempt property in question from current regulations.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I would go there.|`|4uike3ARaa	Since you are receiving no cooperation from the regulatory body, perhaps the least expensive option to pursue would be: document the other houses, and their variations from the code. Use photography. Build a case. Present this case to the city as a choice: either grant my client the building permit, or we will take you to court.<br>  Most municipalities, especially in today's economic climate, cannot afford litigation. Odds are, they will grant the permit rather than risk going to court.|`|AA10109903	I would suggest that you or your client go to the LA county building inspectors office and request the building permits you wish have. Your client should consult with an American Real Estate Attorney to determine what options are available to get the nesscessry documents without running up a legal bill and paying ridiculous court fees<br>  <br>  Another possible option you might have is if you are in a court action now. You can file a motion to compel the city to produce those documents.  <br>  <br>  Good luck

You'd think they'd learn, but no, they just keep falling for it.
BphZi9yDaa	I sounds like a pretty crappy situation, but I doubt it will actually be seen as "unethical" unless you feel you were discriminated against because of race, sex, religion...etc. then they will probably just say there is nothing they can do. Sometimes in situations like this, if you go back and read your paper work that you signed when you started there in the first place, I bet there is some paper you signed that says something like they can "technically" let you go or lay you off or not promote you and all that for any reason(except the ones mentioned above, i.e. sex, religion, race...) without any explanation.Most businesses have you sign something like that. And since you were just applying for this position, I doubt they will hear you out if you tried. But i hope everything does work out for you. good luck!|`|AA11206283	uh...sounds like common practice.

No.<br>  <br>  You can try and make your case though that the position was offered to you and you were accepted. The bad part though is that March 2nd has arrived yet so they are not obligated to make you fulltime at this point.<br>  <br>  Don't give up hope though. Keep smiling in the office. Keep doing what you have been doing and when the next position opens you'll again be the leading candidate for it. It's tough to have something like this happen but if you're happy there show that you're a team player and just keep doing your job as you have been. You will be rewarded for it...really.|`|Maw2rtKZaa	That doesn't sound unethical to me but good business sense.  So instead of you getting full time, another person gets to keep their job.

If there is no such rule, then the question is whether your "offer" was completed. It sounds like it was not, in part because your boss did not have the final authority to give you the job. The unethical behavior would have been saying or implying your new status was a done deal when in fact it was not.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	It is not ethical as you were already offered the position and hired but you should look into the company policy for answers.|`|WypJADCuaa	I doubt very serious that you get anywhere by calling the ethics line..

He walked into the room like women, he spoke like we are in kindergarten & he was so boring no one knows what he said.

I've printed the list so I can keep tabs on how he's doing, so we'll see what kind of benefit comes out of it. He's assembled a good team, he's a smart, practical man and his office seems fully aware of the problems it faces, which makes me cautiously optimistic. I'm wary of trusting any politician completely, but I'm hopeful that Obama will succeed. I've supported him since the primaries.<br>  <br>  I always enjoy hearing him speak. His oratory skills are often complimented, and with good reason. The one thing I didn't enjoy was all the clapping!

I find this especially offensive when in the same speech he insults my intelligence by claiming some false devotion to deficit reduction. Not to mention he outright lied again saying that the stimulus bill had no earmarks in it. However, the most telling statement about spending was this one and it tells the whole story of just how out of control this administration will be. " this plan will require significant resources from the federal government - and yes, probably more than we've already set aside." He is setting the stage for the next stimulus bill already.

94f7a545cb2df2c615c0690382dec2d2aa	The quality and configuration of your dorm room really depend on the base.  The last time I saw three people to a room was 25 years ago in Germany.  You'll undoubtedly have a roommate at tech school.  And for the first phase of training (up to day 29) you can't have any "personal" bedding...just what they issue you.  You can certainly buy a TV and computer...but as to what is available in your area, it really depends on the base.    Most AF dorms are nice...quite a bit like college dorms.  When you're permanent party, you can usually rearrange your furniture and have lamps and nice bedding.  Some people have little area rugs and decorative items.  Of course you buy all that yourself, but it may be worth it.  Most dorm rooms have a mini-refrigerator and a sink, and the shared bathroom is the toilet and tub/shower.      Higher ranking people usually have better rooms...meaning more privacy and more space.  The AF spends a lot of money on quality of life issues, so they do try with their dorms.      You nearly always have to clean your own areas as well as "pull details" where you are assigned to clean common areas.  I never lived in a dorm with maid service, but my husband did in Saudi Arabia.      Within reason means not offensive, not destructive, not unsafe.      Most dorms have "curfew" and "quiet" hours...so you can't have a big old party on a work or school night.  But if you're of legal age, and no longer "in phase" at school, you can drink in your room, watch TV, play video games...whatever doesn't disturb others.|`|v6l3o2kvaa	They are like college dorms to a point, more like mini hotel rooms, but you have to buy your own TV and stuff for it like XBOX, or DVD Player.  Internet most likely will be the same outcome but if you have a laptop get a broad band card.    You can bring certain things but your beds will be to AF standards so no special sheets, pillows, and blankets.  Anything you do bring make sure it can fit into your wall locker because they do routine inspections.    Edit:  For the what you can have in your room question.  The only things your aloud to have out that are personal items are your tv and game console or dvd player.  You can have or bring whatever you want it just can't be left out during the day in your room.  Thats why I added make sure it can fit into a wall locker or you'll be spending your weekends doing ramedial training and not sleeping in on saturday sunday at Tech school.    Theres really no within reason it just depends on what your tech school is and the rules they enforce,    Hope that clearifys things|`|EtN6P9PPaa	Very nice.  I think the USAF even has maid service.  You should look into the Marine Corps!  they have the best barracks out there and the food is good too!|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Most AF dorms have gone to a 1-1 configuration, where there are 2 rooms that share a common bathroom.  It will have a bed, dresser, desk and chair, and closet.  Anymore comfort than that.... it's your $$.  Beds are normal single beds, so any sheets will fit.  TV, phone, and internet are on you.  If you want cable, you'll have to pay for it.  You want phone in your room... pay for it.  Internet... pay for it!  But, yes, you can decorate them any way you would like, within limits.    Now, that's once you get to your first duty assignment.  Basic will be a large room with lots of folks and bunk beds.  Tech school you'll probably have a room mate.      Maid service as the one person suggested... nope! Clean your own room and your own toilet!    ETA: Within limits: no porn, nothing racist, nothing treasonous.  You may or may not be able to paint (that will depend upon the dorm manager).  You will have room inspections, so keep that in mind.|`|kjtwQ167aa	The dorms are going to vary where ever you go. In tech school the dorms we lived in at Lackland were condemned (black mold) after my class had finished. My first dorm room here in Osan AB was small and i had a roommate (one room two beds with 2 suite-mates sharing a bathroom) now they moved me into a brand new 8 story $37 million dorm. 4 people, each have their own room with walk-in closet, bathroom with tub and then we have a living room/kitchen/dinning room area with a fridge, stove top, couch, chair dinner table and tv stand. We do have to pay for our own internet though. It all depends on the location of where your going.|`|mBJbssvXaa	This is what it says on the air force website. As an enlisted member new to the Air Force, you will find the accommodations a lot like a college dorm. You'll have your own private room that you can personalize to your tastes, including a private bath, full-sized refrigerator and computer desk. In the common rooms, you can catch the game on the big-screen TV, hang with your friends or cook meals in the kitchen.     Houses on base are designed to meet the needs of growing families. Most residences feature attractive interiors, updated appliances, multiple bedrooms and baths and grassy backyards. Best of all, they're often within walking distance of schools, stores, playgrounds and community pools.     If you live off base, you'll have a housing allowance that will probably cover most of your rent. Many single enlisted members also find roommates to help share the rent on a bigger place.     No matter where you choose to live, you'll probably find yourself spending a lot of time on base, taking advantage of the tax-free shopping, discounted food and free medical care that will help lower your overall cost of living.
SkwdQLdVaa	he would have to serve his time after his "reading".  he would be on holdover and his orders would be suspended for the time being.  as far as him still going to fort benning he should still be able to go there, but 45 days is still a long time and there's still a possibility that that might change unless he's supposed to go to airborne school or has that in his contract.  He sure was lucky for just getting a field grade article 15 though.  Reading means they would read his ar 15 and that's when he would do 45/45|`|v6l3o2kvaa	Well, the way you just read it off that's what he's gonna get.  He's lucky they aren't going to dishonorably discharge him......very lucky actually.|`|7149XmBqaa	They could conceivably put him on legal hold and keep him there to pay the piper.  That would be his best bet at any rate, because if he reports to his new command with Article 15 proceedings incomplete, they may just throw him in the stockade for a while.  That's what I would have done had a newbie showed up at my command with an Article 15 outstanding.  What a disgrace.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Another fine soldier.  An Article 15 during AIT!|`|rFFYCmOGaa	AR15 is an administrative disciplinary measure and has nothing to do with AIT training so he should be fine.|`|AUB1ieOHaa	i think every situation is handled a little different.  i received an article 15 when i was in AIT.  they took some money from me and i had to do extra duty for awhile.  they also said they took rank from me but when i got home i was still the same rank.  i do know some people that had to stay after for a few weeks, and i even knew someone that had to get recycled and start all over.  I think a lot of it depends on what you did to get the article 15.  failing the drug test is kinda a big deal!  I hope everything works out!|`|ZFaEb2hGaa	He is very lucky to not be getting discharged, but that is how things go when you are in an Initial Entry Training (IET) environment.  I would stress to him that he does whatever he needs to do to keep himself from repeating the drug use again.  If he gets to his first duty station and he comes up hot again, depending on how stringent the unit is, he could be discharged without a second thought.    He should definitely expect to receive 45/45 not to mention a reduction in rank, if he has any...    To be read an article 15, is that the soldier will appear in front of a company commander.  The article 15 will be documented on a Department of the Army (DA) Form 2627.  The commander will read out the charge, the soldier's NCO will be standing there also while the commander makes a decision of what the punishment will be.  Whatever the punishment, it will take effect that day.    What should happen is that he will serve is fourty five days restriction and extra duty.  Yes-- this is going to keep him from going to his permanent duty station.  However, once he serves his time at AIT he will be sent to his unit immediately thereafter.|`|aD6vgXP8aa	If he receives punishment, he will be held over at his AIT site, typically, until the punishment is completed.  One other possibility is that the AIT will take administrative actions also, not related to the punishment.      If the AIT cadre feel that he is no longer suited/eligible for the MOS, depending on what it is, he could be recommended for relief (thrown out of the course).  This could result in his be reclassified/retrained into another MOS at the needs of the Army.      This is a distinct possibility.  This happened to several of the students while I taught AIT.  They committed an infraction that resulted in their being removed from the course, and sent away at the needs of the Army.
YiY9Yd2Jaa	Yes, contrary to several comments here, in most cases. Some countries have more stringent requirements but most allow it. I was a Military brat, raised on Navy bases all over the world and I have dual citizenship - one based on my place of birth and the other my parent's nationality. Many of my friends both from childhood and during my own military career have dual citizenship for their offspring.    It is interesting to observe how many people react to a question like this with (incorrect) data that relates only to the US and its Military bases, although everyone knows that the internet and this forum is international. Only the Americans seem to do this - assume that the world ends at the US borders.    mamour I was born in the UK to US parents (one who was later to migrate to Australia) . I have UK/Australian plus US citizenship and have had since the early seventies. I lived and worked in both Texas and California for some years) I have several daughters, one of whom was born in Sweden to a French (naturalised Australian) mother. She successfully applied for Swedish citizenship. I am currently working with a journalist who was born to military parents who were based at the US embassy in Canberra at the time of her birth (seventies - I am too polite to ask exactly what year :) ) and she had dual US/Australian citizenship. As I said some countries won't allow it, many will depending on the "other" citizenship of the applicant. Recently - after Australia joined the US in Iraq - the US dropped the visa/green card requirement for many Australians.  It is not as straightforward as you assume.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	It depends.  If both your parents are American, for example, you only take their citizenship if you are born overseas while your parent is serving, even if you are born in a civilian hospital.  If one of your parents is a local, then you can have his/her nationality as well, if it is allowed.|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	no,you cannot.  ps:   midnite...  NO you cannot receive citizenship if you are born in another country, unless that country of course allows citizenship by birth on the soil. not many country do that anymore,   or? if one parent already has citizenshipin  that country?or in some countries? if the one or both parents have permanent residency in that country.the child can have citizenship (Germany for ex)but choice will have to be made at age 23 ,  now?   how about you putting the country of your birth? to resolve this?|`|X9oeSbrMaa	No, you cannot. Technically speaking the area of ground the Military base occupies, belongs to the sovereignty that owns the base.   For example Guantanamo Bay Cuba, is United States territory, not Cuban.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	Yes. But most civilized countries require that you have a parent who is a citizen of that country in order to get citizenship. US military bases are NOT US soil as a lot of people seem to think.|`|oRMJcPoTaa	It depends on the laws of the country that the military base sits on.  Every sovereign nation determines who will be allowed to become its citizen.
SIfHpxCOaa	You need to apply for a change of status ASAP and express mail it so that you'll get a notice of action within 2 weeks.      When I sent my application to change my status from B1/B2 to a Permanent Resident the USCIS also sent me a Notice of Action indicating that I am allowed to travel in and out of the USA for a year while my petition to change my status is pending.    When I went to the Philippines for a vacation I carried that letter with me w/ my passport.  When you re-enter the USA you just need to show that Notice of Action letter to the immigration officers and you should not have a problem.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	stay in USA until you graduate.     And yes you should have filed for change of status as soon as you wrere married.  If you have not done that, then you are probably in ILLEGAL status right now. Therefore if you leave USA, the chances are very high that you will be denied reentry to USA.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	You're still out of status and need to file I-485 and I-130 (etc) as soon as possible.  You also should not leave the country until you have an actual green card in your hands. I-131 (advance parole/re-entry permit) is no guarantee that you will actually be allowed back in, especially with you having been out of status for more than a just few months.
BLTq0vLWaa	I'm going to assume your referring the the UK Fire Service, If not ignore me.

xWSIIOpaaa	There are at least 14 NATO Military bases and outposts in Italy, with plenty of US military personnel stationed there. Do you really believe that mail addressed to APO and FPO addresses in Italy would be refused by Italian post offices?    Just send your mail as it was an international letter sent to an address in the US (remember to add USA below the address) with the appropriate postage. As a rule, registered letters and trackable packages are not accepted to be sent to APO or FPO addresses, as they are considered equivalent to P.O. boxes.|`|pMA4xoVEaa	Gotta love the Italians ,they know how to protect their own!|`|aYD9EoC9aa	I can't speak for Italy, just for Germany, but I would think it works about the same way. The postal workers might give you a hard time about this, but generally letters can be sent from civilian post offices to APO addresses.     I could send letters through the German post office. Those letters would all be collected in one place (Darmstadt for Germany) and then handed over to the Military Postal Service, which then would deliver it to the APO address in question. Postage would be the simple inland charge. You could do a trial run, get a stamp for Italian mail and stick the letter in a mailbox (I tended to bypass the German postal workers, since some of them didn't know about this and tried to tell me I need to pay more postage and whatnot) and see if it gets to where you want it.     I would think this works for any country that houses American forces.    However, they would NOT take any packages, something about seeing the PO Box and their stubborness that they can't deliver to a box...Quite stupid, but I guess they just follow their regulations...    Hope this helped some, good luck!!!|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Nope, the person at the USO is mistaken.  You can mail directly to an APO address from an Italian post office.  You need to make sure you put USA as the country, not the country he is based in.      It's just plain old international mail... no issues.    ETA: sorry to say, but just letters.  No experience with pkgs.

There are also many different Navy people who go to Joint Forces and fight along side other service members.    A lot of aviation will go to war too.    The Ships are a hazardous place. Ask anyone who served on the USS Cole.  That was the ship that was in Yemen tied to a pier and a boat hit the side killing 17 sailors. (Terrorist attack Oct 12, 2000)     Remember Pearl Harbor? How many more Navy died there?     Don't think because you go to sea that you aren't in the war.    Don't worry about what the chicks think...most women like a strong confident man.

Among the reasons for this law is the concern of Congress that buying and selling of organs might lead to inequitable access to donor organs with the wealthy having an unfair advantage.

Europe has social programs, their socialists (social democrats, democratic socialists) are virtually all second internationale, they are reformers of capitalism. People who want to reform capitalism want to preserve capitalism. In my view Europe is not socialist, the EU is a capitalist project. There's no European minimum wage and not even a minimum standard to join in labor conditions. Only in the mind of a social darwinist can Western Europe be considered socialist.    The socialist revolution, which signifies the forcible entrance of the masses into conscious political struggle, portends the greatest and most progressive transformation of the form of mans social organization in world history  the ending of society based on classes and, therefore, of the exploitation of human beings by other human beings.   Capitalism survived the 20th century not because objective conditions were insufficiently mature for socialism, but rather because the leadership of the mass working class parties was insufficient for socialist revolution. The working class again and again entered into epic struggles. But these struggles, misled by the Stalinists, social democrats, centrist and reformist organizations, ended in defeats.   Capitalism exists today because of the betrayals of the working class by its own organizations - the mass political parties and the trade unions. The world political situation as a whole is chiefly characterized by a historical crisis of the leadership of the proletariat. These words, with which Leon Trotsky began the founding document of the Fourth International, remain supremely relevant as a definition of contemporary political reality. There is not a single mass organization in the world today that presents itself as an opponent of the existing world capitalist order, let alone summons the working class to revolutionary struggle. This has created a surreal environment, in which the anger and discontent of the working class is suppressed by the old, politically sclerotic organizations. But as Trotsky also wrote in the founding document of the Fourth International, The Transitional Program: The orientation of the masses is determined first by the objective conditions of decaying capitalism and second by the treacherous politics of the old workers organizations. Of these factors, the first of course is the decisive one: the laws of history are stronger than the bureaucratic apparatus.    That's socialism, anything less reformism that inevitably betrays the working class in the end.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	Capitalism means freedom, where people are free to start business, innovate, produce and enjoy the fruits of their labor.    Socialism means the governments controls the means of productions , centrally plans the economy and control every facet of people's lives. Socialism often eventually leads to a totolatarian government.    Here is a short cartoon by Friedrich A.

A political philosophy that can only work on a relatively small scale, as is Communism.  Both are against basic human nature.    It does not apply to Europe at all, anyplace else for that matter.|`|G0XIQespaa	Socialism is a system in which the economy is non-capitalistic. In other words, the economy is controlled by the government entirely. This is the opposite of the American way becuase the people have control of the economy here. In a socialist system, the country's wealth is divided up equally among the people to get rid of competition. This system generally fails because people are greedy, thus competition is pre-existent.    In one sentence i would say, Socialism is an socioeconomic system in which the government controls all economic activity completely.|`|2FeDnO0Saa	I don't think any of the governments of Western Europe are socialist. Socialism does not mean top-down control from above; I think you are getting mixed up with Stalinism.    I live in Britain, which is part of Western Europe.    Where I live, many of our industries which were once nationalised were sold off by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. We are a largely service and financial-based economy now, which is why we are suffering so much from the recession. The Tories also sold off our railways and buses to private companies, which is why our roads are permanently gridlocked and public trasnport is so expensive.    Our healthcare system is still nationalised, but this is rapidly being privatised by New Labour. Most of our schools are comprehensive, publicly funded, but there is still a private education system for those who can afford it. The gap between rich and poor has widened in Britain, so much so that you are less likely than at any time since the 1950s to be able to escape the class you are born into. Therefore, the poor stay poor, their children go to the worst schools and they have the worst job prospects. The rich are still getting richer and creaming off the best jobs.    I live in a capitalist country. The few socialist things we have in Britain came about due to the 1945 Labour government, going a small way towards socialism, in order to rebuild the country after the second world war. They promised a land fit for heroes, but the NHS and our public services have been under attack ever since.    A socialist country would be controlled by ordinary people. It would be democratic - we would elect our bosses, so that workers could not be exploited. In Catalonia, during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), there was a real socialist society set up, albeit only briefly. People were paid in vouchers for each hour worked, rather than money, meaning that everyone got the same. This was very popular with the poor peasants, but not with the rich bourgousie. Ordinary soldiers would elect the officers in the army.    In 1968, in France, there was a chance of getting socialism - after the massive general strike, which saw De Gaulle flee the country. Workers' committees ran factories, but again this was all too short lived. The trade unions won massive concessions by the government, but again these have been under attack ever since.    A socialist government would have a planned economy. There would be no need for the colossal wastefulness of capitalism - why do we need hundreds of different brands of shampoo for instance? Why do we need to waste billions of pounds in developing marketing and waste the talents of people in persuading us to buy things we do not need? We could decide ourselves what we need to make and distribute resources equally amongst everybody.    See source below for an organisation which is fighting for democratic socialism in the US and in 40 countries worldwide.|`|FOai1n0Xaa	It really depends on whose definition you are speaking of.     'Socialist Parties' in places like France and Spain do little more than administer capitalism with some welfarist policies to protect the public from the absolute brutality of a free market.     A libertarian ideologues may view anything short of laissez-faire as somewhat socialist. Then you have people saying bailing out banks by handing large sums of money to their CEOs is socialist. I disagree with this. That's not socialist at all by my definition. Of course these sort of people don't consider themselves socialist, and Obama and Bush certainly don't define themselves as socialists so I think this definition is a grave and deliberate distortion.    Socialism to me has nothing to do with doling out cash to scumbag bankers and everything to do with the people who actually produce commodities and services being the ones who are democratically in control of who does what, what is produced, and how it is distributed.    This system stands diametrically opposed to capitalism as the motivation for production comes from satisfying human need rather than accumulating profit. Ultimately socialism means a much more democratic society. Now we have the right to (within limits) democratically elect a government to administers the state while the often more important decision of what gets produced and how it is distributed are under the despotic control of whoever 'owns' the means of production (ie the capitalist).    With socialism, democracy would extend right down into workplaces, schools, and anything else. Means of production cease to be the property of a private individual and become the collective property of everyone. It would also be a more participatory democracy where instead of just electing a bunch of professional politicians to be decision makers, the whole public would be constantly involved in democratic decision making right throughout every aspect of society.    The fundamental thing is the democratic participation of the producers. If you have a situation where the state assumes control of production without the democracy, and directs production in the interest of enriching a class of bureaucrats (like in USSR, China, Nth Korea, etc) you don't have socialism; you have another form of capitalism where instead of private capitalists there is just a strata of bureaucratic state capitalists.   This also goes for nationalizing the banks or the railways or whatever like Social Democrats often do. Its still not socialist because even though people have some democratic control over the government who administers them, the producers don't have direct democratic control over every facet of production.    Contrary to what some may say this is not incompatible with human nature, indeed it takes a very small minded person indeed to believe that what is observed in the context of our current society is all that humanity is capable of being. A casual glance at the many forms of society existing now and in the past that are not capitalist and stand in contradiction to it explodes this philistine myth.

I agree especially about the paid volunteers.  I was sickened when I learned this.  People were thinking that he had so many supporters and these people were drawing paychecks.  When I worked hour after hour on McCain's campaign, I was never paid.  I got a bottled water a few times and once a bag of chips.  I stood with a sign in cold Jan. weather during the primaries, and stood with a sign on election day.  I spent hours on the phone out of sheer dedication for this man and belief that he was right for America.  When I stood there on election day and saw dozens upon dozens of his "supporters" standing there taunting me and voters who had McCain/Palin bumper stickers I was sickened and then to learn later on they were getting paid to be there was the worst of all.  I think it should be a law that campaign workers should never be paid, it's downright sinful.  It made it look like he had many more people than he really did, I think, which contributed to his win.    The abuse Sarah Palin got was also a sin.  People were scouting around Alaska (MSNBC, mostly) just looking for dirt on her.  They made up tons of stuff and circulated terrible emails and lies about her.  Those kind of tactics are what trashes our country.  Federal employees shouldn't have cars, by the way, in any administration.  They should have their own transportation and be paid mileage.  If they don't have a car, provide an hourly car service for them and there are plenty of car services that use hybrids nowadays.|`|xEdhOEsqaa	You have every right to criticize our president or any politician on their decisions.

Simply criticizing our government is not inherently racist.     All of the things you listed are valid concerns, but only if you're really looking for an explanation.

Everyone has the right to decide what happens with their body. If they don't want to have a baby, they won't. Nobody should tell them what to do with it. Besides, the 'baby' is nothing but a cluster of cells when it's aborted. It doesn't have a conscience, it's not alive. If it can't function in the outside world then it's not alive.

Don't know whether I would keep it or put it up for adoption (I'm married, no kids yet).  I have no right to kill a person who has done nothing wrong; unborn children are no exception to that.|`|XtQbPiD1aa	The question that really needs to be asked is what business is it of the government to interfere in this situation.  The best answer I have heard to that is to defend the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  The sole constitutional purpose of our government.  This then extends to the question: at what point does the fetus/child have these rights?  This is what people have a hard time agreeing about.      My mother was given a life or death choice when she was pregnant with me and diagnosed with a fast metabolizing breast cancer.  She chose death to give me life by refusing chemo and radiation therapy until I was born.  For me to deny my right to life while in the womb would make her sacrifice less meaningful.    In the case of a rape I think a "morning after pill" should be offered as an alternative to the victim.  Not only is it a much less tragic solution for the victim than an abortion but it is a much easier pill to swallow for those that believe in pro life. (pun intended)|`|Q9MBZZMcaa	i really think its murder and just not right to do.the baby is a human just like u.and its not the babies fault if someone does rape u.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Because it's murder.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	No one can tell you whether to be or not to be pro-choice.

Cause a lifetime of pain and suffering for the mother for what she let occur to her defenseless child..  anything else?    What do you think actually happens to those babies?  They don't just automatically disappear-they are ripped apart in their mothers wombs.  Sorry to be so graphic-but killing children isn't acceptable.  And according to Planned Parenthoods own stats-92% of all abortions are simply birth control.|`|fDuCamMraa	I don't believe that most people think ALL abortions should be banned. But by the same token it should not be the FIRST method of birth control. Which is what the liberals want.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	I believe that every baby in the world should experience life.    Do you wish that you were aborted?|`|0kjWE73qaa	Murdering a baby is morally wrong. Completely. No question about it unless your life is in danger directly because of the baby.    The United States was founded on the Declaration of Independence. And one of the most famous lines in that great document is "All men are created equal." And I think Thomas Jefferson meant it when he said created, not born.    Life begins at the moment of conception, and no one, not even the parent, has the right to play God and choose whether or not the baby lives.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Most abortions are for social reasons, and not for medical reasons or because of rape.The latter are reasons to get an abortion, but the thing with rape is that there is no clear line when a rape has occurred. 50% of rapes are false allegations. This not only ruins the reputation of a man, but kills an offspring.     http://www.anandaanswers.com/pages/naaFa...     Anyways, I'm not going to try to change you. I need somebody to argue with.
fDuCamMraa	I seem to remember a famous quote. "Only the little people pay taxes." I do believe the Democrats around Washington DC have taken that to heart.|`|SkOALXv9aa	I do not believe ones political affiliation has anything to do with paying taxes.  I do however believe that there are far more secular progressives or far left liberals in the democrat party than in the other leading political parties.  Liberals are those who favor changing our constitution while conservatives see no reason to change something that is not broken.  Our Constitution has been protecting the American people for over 200 years.    As for the paying of taxes, the middle and upper class pay higher tax than the lower class.  In fact it is the middle and upper class that pay for the support of the lower class as it is our tax contributions that pay for all of the welfare programs that the government has established.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	No.  I think you have the silliest question today though.|`|D6kwriPxaa	Wow.

We are all slightly more stupid for having read it.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	Sure seems that way.    And to the poster a few posts above, paying 1/3rd in taxes would be a tax cut for the rich.|`|EjCaTfq0aa	There are just as many "Elite" liberals as Republicans.|`|8l2IMrsFaa	No, I do not.    they do however pay less of a percentage of income tax than the middle class though.  Some think it is unfair.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	Yes I do!    Before you were born, Christianity was the norm and the masses were strongly righteous and moral.  With such a clean-cut society, prostitution, gambling, alcohol and  drugs wasn't as profitable as the "mobsters" wanted it to be. So the mafia began to form "Unions" and used the enticement of a "job" in exchange for political activism. The Crime lords biggest opponents were the Churches. But now they had a "Union Congregation" to battle the Churches and loosen the morals of the public by any means they could. They worked to ban censorship (ACLU was founded by a Roger Baldwin, a Communist) and loosen the FCC Regulations so they could promote erotica, obscenity, violence and glorified drug/alcohol abuse (and at that time "smoking" was "marketed" in all the movies and on television)- this is called "product placement or hyper-commercialism" and it WORKS because you have a captive audience that idolizes the actors.      Before there was television, it was the radio broadcasting that captured America. The mobsters organized musicians unions and got bands and singers records played on air with their "Play for Pay" schemes with local D.J.'s and radio stations. The Songwriters Union wrote songs of rebellion, sexual permissiveness, obscenity and vulgarities. An example of "idol worship",  Britney Spears, who is drug addicted, lost her children and can't keep her pants on, that's what young girls have to look up to? There is a website that lists dead recording artists who died early tragic deaths from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide.     http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/7219...      Soon AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and SAG (Screen Actor Guild) unions fought the Churches by making movies ridiculing religion and making sexually risque' films so they could tempt more viewers and make MONEY from legal films, product "brand" placement and illegal prostitution, drugs, and at one time alcohol and tobacco.      Knowing that Republicans took the high moral ground, the unions became politically active as well, therefore the "Unions" or "Democrats" fought the Republican high moral ground by using influential Actors and popular Musicians, songs, TV and Hollywood Unions (Including the NWU National Writers Unions which controlled newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, textbooks, screenplays, comedians, media of all types, even news media lost it's objectivity.http://westernfrontamerica.com/2008/11/0...    Today the Pay for Play was recently the cause of Blagojevich (Chicago Governor) being prosecuted by the FBI. He's one of the few that got caught. Judges, Politicans, City Councils etc. are all financed by this massive network of unions that are used to control the money being fed to the mafia. Congress feeds them through earmarks (pork barrel). Judges feed them with their decisions (Roe Vs. Wade), (Eminent Domain) and City Councils the their Gov't projects (Casinos, horse racing, Contractors, Public Works & Transportation, Public Service Announcements (our tax $ given to TV/Hollywood & Actors).    Now, through the teachers unions they (Union Godfathers) have control over our tax dollars and our children. The textbooks they read are hand picked by the Unions, many of which are pro communist atheists that have been the cause of student rebellion & protests and degeneracy of morals.

Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.  17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda.  Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.  19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.  20. Infiltrate the press. Gain control of all student newspapers.   21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.  24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.  ?25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.  ?26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as "normal, natural, healthy."  ?27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch."  ?28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state."

I don't understand your point.    just know that these are rights that people have in public. but a company or institution can create their own policies. so you don't have free speech at work. so if you say something at work, you can get fired, but you can't get arrested.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	The First Amendment is more succinct and effective at getting the point across.

AA10460260	Oh my gosh are you kidding me, H yes I am bothered...<br>  <br>  A bit into my situation...<br>  <br>  About 18 months ago I bought my first house at 24.  I didn't want to get into all the trouble that was starting to come up with home forclosures (I lived in Michigan where Forclosures started a bit earlier then the rest of the country) so I made sure to plan out what I wanted to spend and what that corolated into total home price.<br>  <br>  I was approved for a 300k home.  In Ohio now, mind you...where 300k will by you 3000 sq ft, this isn't a Cali-Condo for 600k and 800 sq ft.<br>  <br>  But, I knew if I spent about 100k, that the payments would fit perfect into my budget and I would just deal with the downgraded home...100k mortgage is about 15% of my monthly income (I started using this number when they posted the 39% to 31% government figures).<br>  <br>  ANYWAY, now I want to put in a finished basement, but I can't get a loan because my house is only worth 100k...and the banks are all scared to lend out construction loans because so many people had defaulted!  Meanwhile...if I would have spent way over my head and bought a 300k home, it would have came with a finished basement already, and I would be getting government help to lower my payment so it was like I had bought a 200k home...<br>  <br>  Moral of the story...live above your means and try to keep up with the Jones' and if you can't handle it, the Government will give it to you for being a good sport.<br>  <br>  Sorry...it was a rant...but this really bothers me.|`|Zo8YzixSaa	I'm not being funny but everyone is critcising this approach to the problem without really thinking who is behind all of this.

He nominated 2 tax cheats (almost 3--Nancy Killefer withdrew her name due to tax issues) to serve in his administration:    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090131/ap_o...    He SAID he would ban all lobbyists (then waived the rules when it mattered):    http://www.politico.com/news/stories/010...    He then SAID George W. Bush was wrong for throwing money at the banks (but now wants to do it ON A LARGER SCALE):    http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/busine...    He also said he would veto any bill with pork in it (the solution: SECRET PORK!!):    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090125/ap_o...    And then there's the pork-filled "stimulus" bill which includes:  http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/g...    ? $75 million for "smoking cessation activities."    ? $2 billion earmark to re-start FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that the Department of Energy defunded last year because it said the project was inefficient.    ? A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers to buy motion picture film.    ? $248 million for furniture at the new Homeland Security headquarters.    ? $600 million to buy hybrid vehicles for federal employees.    ? $400 million for the Centers for Disease Control to screen and prevent STD's.    ? $75 million for salaries of employees at the FBI.    ? $25 million for tribal alcohol and substance abuse reduction.    ? $160 million for "paid volunteers" at the Corporation for National and Community Service.

Most people in Europe view homosexuals and other miniorities as fellow humans, unlike the majority of conservatives in this country. Other than that, I've never been interested in wanting the US to be in any way, exactly like Europe, but if you think Europe is what it used to be like in the 1700's, then you need to pick up a history book and educate yourself about Europe.

The US does not punish people for speaking their native language, for wearing their traditional clothes.  The communists were brutal in eviscerating cultural identities, deeming some groups as unfit to become a "soviet man."      bureaucratic coercion does not effect kinder people.  the Marxists who keep propagandizing about "racism" in the former soviet countries should ask themselves if there is indeed racism still?

MISSING MOVEMENT) they don't NEED to question him... they have all the evidence they need:    1) He wasn't mustered at the departure point.  2) He wasn't on the bus, flight, boat or whatever.  3) They took him into custody.

Eventually enough people refuse to obey it willingly that you must raise an oppressive law enforcement organization, like the IRS, to enforce an entirely unfair, unwanted, and unneeded law.  But rather than learn from their mistakes, the politicians multiply the error to the tune of about 700,000 pages that no one could possibly understand.

You think the people that use don't know what the risks are?  What we should do is make a sealed in city with a huge steel wall around it, one way in, one way out, drop all the drugs and alcohol in it and folks can go in and stay.  Make it like Las Vegas. Anything goes.   People should be treated like the adults that they are. Not like little children who can't make up their stupid minds about things.  We should in fact get rid of some laws as they're a billion times stupid and way out dated.  http://www.idiotlaws.com/   Go there and take a look at some really stupid laws.  Did you know in Texas anal sex is still a hang able crime?  I think we should leave drug use alone. If you want to stick some thing harmful in your body it's your choice.  I don't see anyone ripping apart others for eating junk food and that's just about as dangerous as most drugs.  Laws don't make people safer they make people more unsafe. The more forbidden a thing is the more people want to do it.  Make it so they can and make them aware of what can happen and people won't want to do it.  Besides some illegal drugs are in fact better for you than a lot of over the counter and prescription drugs but because there's more money in them being illegal we're not allowed to have them.  Our government is called "Big Brother" but until he has proven he can be trusted with my personal, mental and spiritual care I don't want him near my ability to decide things for myself.

YupMCYHlaa	LOL!  Doesn't she have a lot of 'em?  She didn't even get down to my favorites--Motorcycle Safety, Military Intelligence, and Wedded Bliss.    I don't think there is a secular leader!  At one time it was Barry Goldwater.  Up to last year it was John McCain, but he changed his attitude to get the Christian Right back in his camp for the election.  When push comes to shove, no Republican is able to cheese off the Religious Right.    But there's going to be some changes in the party in the next few years.  They have to redefine and reinvent themselves.  And I think a lot of party leaders are seeing that their unholy alliance with the Christian Right is doing them more harm than good.

If you claimed ignorance, the answer you would get back from the IRS is "It is your obligation to know you should have paid those taxes", mind you this is generally 2-4 years later when they get around to auditing your return.  He is already riding high avoiding tax evasion prosecution and he gets the break on Penalties too.  I just love this new message the goverment is sending us about individual responsibility, but if you are an insider you get the breaks.

lAZWTLtRaa	Um I'm guessing you're talking about Canada?  Federal = control over Canada, Provincial = control over provinces.  They have control over different areas: for example, federal = control over postal service, and provincial has control over direct taxation (that's all I can remember haha but look it up on the internet)  Federal obviously has more power, and they have GST, provinces do PST, which explains why Alberta doesn't have to pay PST, but Ontario does. (Im not sure about other provinces or their rates).  I think it's just a matter of power that separates them.  Federal government has control over the court system, and anything that should be equal in all provinces.  I think provincial government was just used to get all of the provinces to join confederation, but that's my personal opinion.

So, have a name where the typset doesn't allow the actual spelling to be used - Scottish multiple capitals, apostrophes in mid-name, or none English alphanumeric characters and you're virtually guaranteed that your data will be wrong.

Controversial 'E-Verify' Immigration Program on Hold  Pamela A. MacLean  The National Law Journal  February 3, 2009  http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=12...     Printer-friendly  Email this Article  Reprints & Permissions      A controversial federal program intended to screen illegal aliens out of jobs and pushed during the waning days of the Bush Administration has been put on hold until at least May 21 by President Barack Obama's administration.     Congress created the program, known as E-Verify, in 1994 as a voluntary means for employers to submit names and Social Security numbers of new employees for matching to the Social Security Administration's database.     But in 2008, President Bush signed an executive order mandating that federal contractors submit to the E-Verify program the names of new hires and existing employees. It applied broadly to primary contractors with contracts over $100,000 and subcontractors with more than $3,000 contracts.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	It is mostly used on US citizens so who knows.

Best option: say something about his mama, then Mace him when he comes at you.

If someone simply says that "all green people are idiots," you can't sue them.    If someone says, "the Hometown Hobos baseball team are a bunch of pedophiles," it might be illegal if someone did it specifically to make people believe that they really are pedophiles.

In this package, the government will be the biggest beneficiary in terms of money ... the majority of jobs created will be government jobs ... the main "private sector" beneficiaries will be those in public housing and those getting federally backed loans.      The desire for the government to take care of its people is a noble one.... If the end-result of this desire is a population made dependent on the government, however, a disastrous disservice has been done.|`|07YBD5mJaa	Campaign workers for Senator and presidential candidate Barack Obama are under fire for displaying a flag featuring communist hero Che Guevara. But Obama has his own controversial socialist connections. He is, in fact, an associate of a Chicago-based Marxist group with access to millions of labor union dollars and connections to expert political consultants, including a convicted swindler.       Obama's socialist backing goes back at least to 1996, when he received the endorsement of the Chicago branch of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) for an Illinois state senate seat.  Later, the Chicago DSA newsletter reported that Obama, as a state senator, showed up to eulogize Saul Mendelson, one of the "champions" of "Chicago's democratic left" and a long-time socialist activist. Obama's stint as a "community organizer" in Chicago has gotten some attention, but his relationship with the DSA socialists, who groomed and backed him, has been generally ignored.         Blogger Steve Bartin, who has been following Obama's career and involvement with the Chicago socialists, has uncovered a fascinating video showing Obama campaigning for openly socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Interestingly, Sanders, who won his seat in 2006, called Obama "one of the great leaders of the United States Senate," even though Obama had only been in the body for about two years. In 2007, the National Journal said that Obama had established himself as "the most liberal Senator." More liberal than Sanders? That is quite a feat. Does this make Obama a socialist, too?      DSA describes itself as the largest socialist organization in the United States and the principal U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. The Socialist International (SI) has what is called "consultative status" with the United Nations. In other words, it works hand-in-glove with the world body.      The international connection is important and significant because an Obama bill, "The Global Poverty Act," has just been rushed through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, with the assistance of Democratic Senator Joe Biden, the chairman, and Republican Senator Richard Lugar. The legislation (S.2433) commits the U.S. to spending hundreds of billions of dollars more in foreign aid on the rest of the world, in order to comply with the "Millennium Goals" established by the United Nations. Conservative members of the committee were largely caught off-guard by the move to pass the Obama bill but are putting a  "hold" on it, in order to try to prevent the legislation, which also quickly passed the House, from being quickly brought up for a full Senate vote. But observers think that Senate Democrats may try to pass it quickly anyway, in order to give Obama a precious legislative "victory" that he could run on.         Another group associated with the SI is the Party of European Socialists (PES), which heard from Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, back in 2006. Dean's speech is posted on the official Democratic Party website, although the European socialist parties are referred to as "progressive." Democrats, Dean said, want to be "good citizens of the world community." He spoke at a session on "Global Challenges for Progressive Politics."      Following up, in April 2007, PES President Poul Nyrup Rasmussen reported that European socialists held a meeting "in the Democrats HQ in Washington," met with officials of the party and Democratic members of Congress, and agreed that "PES activist groups" in various U.S. cities would start working together. The photos of the trip show Rasmussen meeting with such figures as Senator Ben Cardin, Senator Bernie Sanders, officials of the Brookings Institution, Howard Dean, and AFL-CIO President John W. Sweeney, a member of the DSA. The Brookings Institution is headed by former Clinton State Department official Strobe Talbott, a proponent of world government who was recently identified in the book Comrade J as having been a pawn of the Russian intelligence service.      The socialist connections of Obama and the Democratic Party have certainly not been featured in the Washington Post columns of Harold Meyerson, who happens not only to be a member but a vice-chair of the DSA. Meyerson, the subject of our 2005 column, "A Socialist at the Washington Post," has praised convicted inside-trader George Soros for manipulating campaign finance laws to benefit the far-left elements of the Democratic Party. Obama's success in the Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses is further evidence of Soros's success. Indeed, Soros has financially contributed to the Obama campaign.      It is not surprising that the Chicago Democrat, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, has endorsed Obama. Schakowsky, who endorsed Howard Dean for president in 2004, was honored in 2000 at a dinner sponsored by the Chicago chapter of the DSA.

Most of the answers are along the lines of the above  - in other words they are mentally retarded. A tax, any tax takes money from earners. A spending, any spending, gives it to others. Thus, according to their definition every government from Ur to the present our socialist.  Even if you restrict it to welfare, there is no government ever that has not had some type of welfare for some group of people - and thus all governments throughout recorded history are 'socialist'.

In the 1930's the world entered the Great Depression. The state of the economy in that period was far worse that the status quo. We just need to have a strong government influence (Similar to FDR's "New Deal") to fix this problem. It is easily fixable.

America is printing too much money and is destroying the dollar.  This is going to be disastrous to our country.  Both democrats and republicans are responsible for it.  They both allowed the Federal Reserve to print to much money.    Obama's stimulus package won't fix anything; it's actually making things worse because it means we have to print even more money and devalue the dollar even more.    Just look at the chart in the linked source.  And it doesn't even have Obama's $819 Billion stimulus package!

Something spurred this "toddling down the road" it didn't happen because people just decided to do it.    No, we have not reached a point of no return because we are still evolving as a nation.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	That happened because Capitalism failed.  Repeatedly.      The idea was that businesses had a job that needed to be done.  So they would put out a wage that was low, and keep raising it until workers believed it was a good wage, and then they would get to work.  That would then be considered the fair wage for the job.      Problem is, workers need to eat.  The businesses can wait them out, because each worker is afraid another worker will take the job and then they themselves are completely out of money.  Adam Smith (designer of Capitalism) forgot that workers would be competing against each other as well, which would lead to businesses having too much power and workers unable to really get a proper wage.    But workers are also consumers.  So when no one was getting a decent wage, they couldn't buy products.  That meant fewer and fewer sales for businesses.  But instead of putting together the reason why and hiring more people at a proper wage, businesses went into the opposite direction.  They'd lay off more people and cut wages.  Then the system would collapse.    All these things you complain about as Socialism are actually instituted to prevent that collapse from happening again.  It forces businesses to provide a decent wage and decent benefits to workers so they actually can make and save enough money to buy products and keep the system up.    But with each advance in technology that we have, the worker becomes less and less necessary.  Businesses can now automate and replace workers with robots and computers.  Businesses are regaining their advantage over the workers, and the system is collapsing again.  We need to move toward Socialism, not away.  I am not suggesting we go completely to Socialism, but we need to move in that direction again.    Workers need to be able to fight for a decent wage; or the system collapses when they cannot afford any products, but businesses can't figure out why and instead automate or lay off employees, sometimes both.        It turns out that while Socialism, Communism, and Fascism are all failures, Capitalism will eventually fail also.  If we go back, we die.  If we continue forward to Socialism, we die.  So we must continue to try to maintain the balance between worker and business, which moves us toward Socialism but doesn't quite reach it.  It will eventually, but we have some time yet.    The only way to fix the situation is to reset the system.  Which means Revolution, and hope that the new system that arises is Capitalism reset at the beginning, and not pure Socialism or pure Fascism.  History suggests that it will be pure Fascism.    So essentially you can hope for the best with what we are currently doing, or accept probable Fascism in our attempt to fix it.    But no economic system, nor governing system, is perfect.  All will eventually fail.  That does include Capitalism.  We are fighting for a delay in the failure, but we cannot stop it.          Add-on:    And READ what I wrote.  I said Socialism is a failure.  What you are missing is that Capitalism is a failure as well.    There is NO perfect system.  All fail.  Capitalism gives too much power to businesses, but they don't know how to handle it.  If they did, they would be giving us the wages that we deserve and would not need the government forcing them to do so.  We would never have hit the Great Depression.    They ALL fail.  Socialism too, but not just Socialism.  Fascism, Communism, and Capitalism all fail.      Moving toward Socialism, without actually attaining it, keeps giving the worker enough power to match the power of business.  As long as the balance is there, the system doesn't collapse.    Capitalism is too one-sided toward businesses, because workers have to eat and businesses take advantage of that.  It keeps losing the balance, giving too much power to businesses.  Then it collapses.    What you call Socialism is really giving the workers more power.  It gives them enough power to EQUAL the businesses, and keep the balance going.  But with advances in technology comes advances in automation, and workers are being replaced again.    We have to give workers more power again, and that means we need the only thing available that can match business power behind them.  And unfortunately, that's Government.    I don't want the Government getting any more power any more than you want them to do so.  But if businesses cannot handle the power by being willing to pay workers a decent wage without the worker needing to strike to get it, then we have to give the worker more power.          Add-on:    And quit listening to Rush Limbaugh.  I wish he was retarded, so that he'd have an excuse for his bullsh*tting foolishness.    He insists that the private sector is good.  Workers are great, businesses are failing the situation.  They don't want to pay a decent wage, and things are set up where they can avoid it.    Then when it collapses because they have no customers, they have no idea why it is happening, and they CUT jobs and wages at the precise moment when they should be raising both.  They screw themselves and us.    The ones who need the power are us.  You and me.  The workers.  Not business, and not government.  But until one of them wakes up and sees that, we have to go with the one who is more answerable to us.  And like it or not, that is government.    Now what you and I need to do is actually make the government answerable to us again.  Or we need to unionize to give the workers a chance again.  It's up to you, but the worker needs the power, and government does it far more often than business does.|`|0kjWE73qaa	As of January 20, 2009, we are the United States Socialist Republic (USSR for short).

I think the goal is to encourage people to get off of welware (a hand up, not a hand out), so the drug issue is not as relevant as some others.  Although it is not the ideal situation, you may be able to do drugs and be productive a the same time.  Welfare needs a major overhaul along with all the other entitlement programs.  It doesn't make sense that someone would turn down a raise, because the extra income would make them ineligible for the entitlement programs and would place them in a worse situation than they were in.  Additionally, let's move some money towards fraud investigators within the system, they would pay for themselves.  I can't tell you how much it upsets me to follow someone using foodstamps at the supermarket to watch them load up their brand new SUV in the parking lot. Let's catch the cheaters and revamp the system to reward you for working and suceeding in your job, instead of the pay out to have people sit on their butts.

How will you handle that?|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	Absolutley!|`|g5RS83paaa	I totally agree with you, it's not fair|`|k6hicodfaa	So should CEOs have to get drug tested to get our bailout money?|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	Absolutely. Very good point. Too, bad it'll never happen.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Actually, the current welfare system is setup to discourage people as much as possible from going on welfare. For example, if you worked in the last year and have gone through your unemployment, you apparently still can't collect welfare because you made too much money. This is why welfare rolls haven't really increased despite the recession.    But here is the problem with your suggestion, that costs a significant amount of money to do such testing. In fact, it is hardly efficient for businesses to drug test you, but they usually do so for insurance purposes. Now if welfare costs more money and helps less people because of random drug testing, would you be willing to foot the bill?     And what about the people who are on drugs and still need help? Wouldn't it be better to have them in the system so they can get help instead of wandering the streets mugging people to feed their habit?|`|IGbEZZlraa	Well said! I agree with you 100%!

LA and its sister-states of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia have made racism, lynchings, the klan, discrimination and hate crimes their trade-mark in spite of having proportions of black people higher than other states within America.  In-fact the reason for high concentrations of black people in these states is specifically because of America's history of slavery.<br>  <br>  With that being said Jindal's success is a monumental accomplishment for Bobby and a milestone for his state.  Yet, Bobby, who is a brilliant man found his pathway to success, not by searching for his self-identity, but by accommodation and assimilation. <br>  <br>  Examples would include:<br>  1. using Bobby instead of Piyush, to make acceptance among white southerners easier.  Understandable as a child, but he has never moved on to a mature position.  (A love for Bobby Brady just doesn't seem to be a mature idea for a man in his 30s in 2009)<br>  2. complete embrace of the southern republican agenda, even when that agenda is contrary to the interests of other immigrants.<br>  - why would the governor of one states with the most racist history in the nation embrace an agenda against the recognition of hate crimes?<br>  <br>  Bobby's methods have brought him huge success thus far and he is all to eager to allow the republican party to use him as a token representation of diversity.

The President doesn't directly make law but he has a prfound impact on it.  He is also authorized to sign "executive orders" (which are laws) in ceretain arenas without any approval from anyone.

PQJyaFDXaa	Formal politics is politics as defined by law.   Essentially, everyone follows the rules.  One man, one vote, everyone follows the rule of law, people can petition their government for wrongs and have them heard, and so on.    Informal politics isn't really defined, but it is when there are other forms of communication channels used that aren't supposed to be there.  In the United Nations, this takes the form of backdoor channels and is considered a good thing.  (For example, two blood enemies talk together secretly to reduce tensions or lay the groundwork for an agreement when it would be political suicide for their citizens to know negotiations are going on.  Example: Egypt and Israel peace agreement.  Lots of informal negotiations preceded the actual peace talks and agreements.)    In Western countries, informal politics serves both to help and hurt the legitimacy of the political process.  For example, Senator Daschle is not registered as a lobbiest, but obviously he lobbies.  This is legal, but below the radar.  This can both help more effective legislation get passed (which is good), but the actual influence is not documented for public review (which can be bad.)      In developing countries, informal politics tends to undermine the rule of law by creating a tendency towards corruption and cronyism.  This is especially true where a dictatorship is in place, or a democracy is new.  Paying a bribe to get a hearing is an example of informal politics.  So is talking to your tribal elder (through family channels) when he also happens to be a judge or senior government official.
a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa	Politics affect how much a family has to work to keep up with government spending. High employment taxes are hurting families.    Schools are run by the political unions, which try to affect what is best for teachers, and not students.    The workplace is affected because government regulations stymie business growth.

It helped America and other countries' transportation. <br>  <br>  The first automobile developed with a combustion engine was invented by Henry Ford.  Henry Ford later founded the Ford Motor Company, which was known for its achievements in bringing America its first affordable car, the Model-T. The first automobile was created much earlier, in 1866 by Richard Dudgeon of New York City.  This first car was made with a steam engine. <br>  <br>  Over the first few years of the 1920s, the automobile became a hit with everyone, especially young people who wanted freedom and excitement. Soon, almost every household in America owned one. Parents drove to work in their automobiles. Families visited friends and family who lived far away. And young people found a whole new way to have fun. <br>  <br>  The automobile also helped American companies and industries. <br>  <br>  Many people found it hard to drive on the poor dirt roads and that cars required a lot of fuel (gas) to run. So nation wide road construction took place, which created even more jobs, and strengthened the economy even further. <br>  <br>  found the above here on this site:  <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/J002604/LG-car.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/J002604/LG...</a><br>  here is another site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/carl-benz-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/carl-benz-1</a>|`|AA10329269	No, he was not correct in claiming America invented the automobile.

Do as many pushups, pullups, and situps that you can and then try to build on the amount every single day until you get to boot. cause when you get to boot, it will be easier for you. and also run a mile every day too. if you can't do a mile, then start out slow and then progress. cause remember in order to graduate you need to pass the pysical exam.

Anyway he got delayed a couple of weeks while they pushed him to get into shape, but he eventually made it through basic.     The point is that basic training is designed for any healthy adult to pass, it isn't designed to weed people out who didn't come in physically fit. The better shape you are in, the easier basic training will become. But basic training itself is designed to get you into decent shape, and if worst comes to worse and you still aren't in good enough shape, then you will be recycled and given a second chance.    Trust me, nobody flunks out of basic because they aren't fit enough.

The Marines break people down and build them back up.

There is no denying that Marine basic training is the most difficult and longest of all the US armed forces. But if you have the will to succeed and can meet the physical requirements, the only thing standing in your way is yourself. If you haven't watched it yet, see Full Metal Jacket.

This way, you can prepare for it early and be somewhat prepared when you enter.   The military builds your confidence. That's their job. They take a guy or girl and make them into a soldier. I have seen some of the scrawniest, timid people go into the service and come out eating nails.   Don't give up on something you want just because you are unsure. Go for it! Ask questions along the way (unless the DS says otherwise!) and you'll be fine!|`|jHUAfrojaa	Just join. Your recruiter will tell you they have things called "Poole Functions." You and some more poolee's will then be exercising together getting ready for boot camp. My boyfriend is currently in the Marine's and he would go to the poole functions. He said that he doesn't know what to do if he didn't have the poolee functions. You might want to check out this book.  http://www.prepareforbootcamp.com  ask other Marine's how they made it through. You don't have to be fit to join the Marines. They will help you with it all.      This is the minimum for the IST (Initial Strength Test) for men  - 2 Pull Ups  - 35 Sit Ups (2 minutes)  - 1.5 Mile Run - 13:30  That is what you have to do in order to not get in "Fat" Platoon.    Semper Fi :)|`|rxMHRbTzaa	Your question immediatly got my attention because I was once just like you. When I was 18 I was a skinny, non-athletic, geek. No friends, no muscles, no girl, and not cool at all. But I decided I wanted to be a Marine one day when the recruiter called me up, just like they do with almost all high school seniors.    Of course everyone laughed at me when I said I would be a Marine, even my own family told me that I would never make it through Boot Camp. But if you really want it you have to be determined. I had never really applied myself to acomplishing anything in my life until I devoted myself to preparing for Marine Boot camp. I got a Navy Seal training routine book, worked out every day after school, ran with a heavy ruck sack on my back, lifted wieghts, and stopped listening to other people tell me what I could and could'nt do. When I went off to San Deigo for Boot Camp I was scared, it was very hard, but there was no way I was quitting to go back home and let every one say I told you so. I finally became a Marine, served in Desert Storm, travelled all over the world, made life-long friends, and even went on to join the Army and become a Green Beret. The Marines gave me self-confidence that I never had before.    You train hard for at least 3 months. Run, workout, do push ups, pull ups, and sit ups. Go to boot camp with a dont quit attitude and you will make it.

You sound as if you have been around him long enough to know his priorities---not just what he says are his priorities but the priorities that he shows through his actions.    Only you know if your ideals, goals and priorities are similar enough for you two to make it.  You have a choice to accept him AS HE IS or cut your losses.  Only you know what kind of man will make you happy.    I have known women who have had long-term relationships with men who didn't put a priority on supporting themselves.  These women are happy with a stay-at-home boyfriend and gladly pay all household expenses including the man's child support.    Most of the women that I know would never respect a man who didn't at least support himself and his children.    I don't know how you really feel about it.  Only you do.

A 2nd LT usually, depending on what MOS they are in, will end up becoming an XO or take charge as a platoon leader. After your advancement to 1st LT, you will continue to be a platoon leader. Once you are completed with you time as such, you will be sent to the Captain's Course located at your primary MOS TRADOC (Training Doctrine) installation.  As a Captain, your goal is to be company commander. You will begin to work under battalion sized elements and learn the ropes of leadership. From there, you will obtain the rank of Major. Usually, this is a staff job.  You will find yourself in the Battalion or Brigade element working in an S-2 (Intelligence) or S-3 (Operations). Here, you will learn more of the picture of how the Army works as a whole. Your next rank you will obtain is LTC. You will take the reigns of a battalion and work directly with brigade and division assets. After that, you will be a full bird COL. You will take reigns of a brigade sized element and work will everyone from company, battalion, and division sized regiments. You hit the BG status, and you will join the heads at Washington, gaining more experience from other highers. Your next rank is MG, which you will take over a division sized element. Your chance to play the biggest and costly game of Risk. Then you hit LTG, which vary due to your MOS. General, well....you can do what you want. lol     Hope this helped a bit.

teKeLxX2aa	Absolutely, in fact most people I know in the Reserves or Guard are currently going to college. I would definitely recommend that you look into either the Navy or the Air Force, since you already have your associates.     I know that if you decide to do the Navy, you already have enough college credits to go in as an E-3. I'm not an expert on the Air Force, but I'm fairly certain that you would go in at a higher rate since you have college credits. The Air Force currently has a program that will by back student loans (I believe its $10,000) but the Navy Reserve has a $20,000 dollar bonus for a six year commitment.      It all depends on what you want to do. But considering that you already have a two-year college education, the Navy and the Air Force are the most technical of all the other branches. Weigh the pros and cons of all the branches when taking into consideration what it is that you want to do for a living. Most of the branches have a variety of job opportunities, but one branch may suit your job interests more than the others.     As it is, Reservist/Guardsmen get to use the Reserve/Select GI Bill, which covers about 330 dollars a month for full time college students. There's also a kicker (where you put money down for benefits later on) which adds $200 for college tuition (giving you about $530 a month.) The educational opportunities will vary from service to service, but definitely inquire a recruiter from 2 different branches before coming to a decision.     Feel free to ask me any questions about the Reserves and I'll try to offer my advice.|`|HwxcAIwhaa	affirmative,military teaches you life exspirance,you will get stronger,you will get to serve your country,you will get to be the soldier you were born to be.be that soldier son.

Join ROTC instead, and the National Guard through SMP (Simultaneous Membership Program) so you can pick your unit when you graduate. Otherwise, as an active duty officer you'll be sent wherever they want to put you. If youre ok with that, then just join ROTC. The reserves is a bad idea if your college (or one nearby, in many cases) offers ROTC.

kiOD8s8Kaa	I don't know about anything in Minnesota state law that defines felonies as class one, class two, or anything else.  Minnesota statutes just define laws as being felonies or misdemeanors, and each felony has its own maximum term of imprisonment and its own maximum fine.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission has established guidelines for the presumptive imprisonment terms for felonies, and they're ranked by severity level.  First-degree murder always has a life sentence, but other than that, offenses are ranked by most serious, with level XI being second-degree intentional murder and drive-by shootings, level X being third-degree murder and second-degree unintentional murder, level IX being first-degree assault, and so on.  The grid also considers the number of previous crimes.<br>  <br>  And contrary to the previous answer, Minnesota has no death penalty.  That was abolished in Minnesota after a botched hanging in a Ramsey County jail in 1906.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Murder in the 1st Degree would do it.<br>  Class 1 felony in Minnesota is a minimum life sentence, maximum Death penalty.
LkHzsRcDaa	Have you gotten your parents consent about joining the army yet? Why did you want to join army? Just to let you know, war isn't a place for fun and games. Anyways, your grandma is incorrect about Obama's Iraq troop policy- he is not going to increase troop presence in Iraq from what I've heard, but he is redeploying soldiers in Iraq to fight the battles in Afghanistan. All this happens before 2012, so you'll see plenty of action if you want some. Troops stationed in USA will probably still be here, unless called out for duty in Afghanistan most likely. You can forget about Iran, that's not on the agenda from what I know.    update: If you joined the army, then congratulations! It's good to know that you are so patriotic and willing to fight for your country. From what I've heard, there is an increasing need for more troops in Afghanistan, so that is the goal. The insurgency in Iraq appears to be winding down, as the Iraqis take over their own security, but don't expect the Americans to leave any time soon. If you want action, then Afghanistan is probably where you'll be deployed after training. The country is mountainous, and the enemy constantly employs guerrilla tactics.

Crimes are committed because people have cruel intentions and the gun is just a tool.  Guns are suppose to be respected because there lethal and can harm or kill a person.  But the gun is never the culprit.  Just the person intending to use it in a negative manner.  I can target shoot, hunt, and carry one for protection, but that doesn't justify what others use it for.  You can't take rights away from everyone because of a few people that use guns inappropriately and out of cruelness.  You can believe whatever you'd like.

In Kennesaw, Georgia, the law requires the head of household to own at least one weapon with ammunition. The have shown a reduction in crime.    Our Constitution allows for gun ownership. But we don't need to twist the consitution where is refers to gun ownership and the militia. Gun advocates have used the Constitution to support their effort to maintain gun ownership and I believe the wording has been taken out of context from what our founding fathers intended.    I don't think we need to use the Constitution in order to have the right to own a weapon. I do think we need to keep some from gun ownership such as murderers, robbers, and those cases involving a crime of violence.    In hopes this helps...good luck on your report!|`|Ak35Y562aa	YEP, you guys are right!    In nearly EVERY state where tougher gun laws were enacted, crime CONTINUED to climb, or went up FASTER!    To PROVE how gun laws arent working.  Around the 1990's more and more states WROTE in legislation to ALLOW and PROTECT citizens who legally carry firearms for self-defense.(concealed weapons permits)    -----  Im sorry your so called "gun laws" are bad enough in most states, and CLEARLY HAVE NOT WORKED STATISTICALLY!!!  Your gun laws are COMPLETELY based off of "Hopes and Dreams"    -------    Look at Great Britian and London, they enacted a COMPLETE GUN BAN, and 2 years later, they got a 55% rise in GUN CRIME!  Because someone was importing gun INTO the country!    Gun Laws ARENT going to work.  Criminals DO NOT CARE about laws, they will get guns off of the streets or from illegal source OUTSIDE of the USA.  (according to FBI stats, over 60% of guns used in crimes are gotten from people who SHIP and SMUGGLE in guns....or boughten on the streets.....)      Im sorry, you may want to switch sides now and save yourself the embarrasement.    The statistics point in OUR favor clearly....the government IS realizing this, and many states are loosening up gun laws(such as the overturn on the 30year handgun ban in DC)    Also, heres something to consider...which is a FACT.    Ever since the laws of GUN FREE ZONES...which are placed at many schools and public areas.....90% of school shootings in the USA were COMMITED in GUN FREE ZONES!!!    Its an invitation to school shooters, they literally can read a sign and say " HEY NO GUNS HERE! WE CAN KILL WHOEVER WE WANT!"      You CANT intimidate criminals with gun laws, THEY DO NOT CARE!      Just buy a gun, and protect yourself and even up the score....a fear of guns is a sign of sexual immaturity....|`|d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	There shouldn't be. The founding fathers wrote an amendment pertaining to this very issue. And they also made it to where it CANNOT be infringed upon. Their logic behind it still holds very true today. I believe even more so now.      We are being rounded up like cattle folks. There is nothing free nor independent about that at all. Walk softly, yes. But do carry a big stick. And KNOW how to handle them in a responsible manner.      You want to knowthe real truth on gun control? Ask most cops. I think you'll find most of them are very opposed to it.|`|73A0T8ltaa	If we did that; It would only be a matter of time before we were under siege.
GGAgxzJNaa	I think your first step should be the recruiter's office.  Walking through the door is free.  You're not enlisted till you sign up.  Talk to the recruiter. Tell him what you want to be and do.  Get all the literature you can so you can decide what you want to do in the Navy, and after the Navy if you don't make a career of it.  THEN talk to your Mom, so you can explain your plans and answer any questions she may have.  Like you said, you're 19, and it's your life.  Go for it.  And Good Luck!   I was in the Navy myself way back when, and I think you're making a great decision.|`|teKeLxX2aa	I could help give you some constructive advice, but would appreciate it if you took the time to work on your grammar before asking a question. Also, not that I mind but I wouldn't refer to the Navy as an escape route because its disrespectful to people serving in the armed forces.    Your current predicament is not unlike what a lot of people in your age group experience. There are many people out there who don't possess the discipline or motivation to succeed at college right out of high school. I for one was certainly not ready for college straight out of high school, which is why I decided to enlist.    If you box and workout on a daily basis, you are probably more than physically capable of passing the physical requirements of your age group. However, the Navy is more mental than physical, as you are going to have to be able take orders from people you might not agree with most of the time. Its something new to get used to for someone who's only form of institutional discipline has been from school teachers or athletic instructors.     But the Navy is a great way for you to develop important skills that are hard to find anywhere else (like leadership, confidence and determination). I was a little bit skeptical at first, but looking back now its probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. If you go into the Navy, you'll be covered when it comes to the basics like food and shelter. The pay isn't nearly comparable to the civilian sector, but you don't have to pay for food or housing, plus you get additional pays and allowances depending on your deployment or circumstances.     Not to mention if you score well enough on your ASVAB, you'll probably have the option to choose from over 100 Navy careers before you enlist. You'll learn skills and knowledge that may be directly transferable to the civilian sector afterwords, or you could continue your education after your contract is up with the new Post 9/11 GI Bill, which is supposed to fully reimburses all college tuition.     The Navy has a lot of options, and has helped many people like yourself find out what they want to do with their life. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding the Navy and I'll be glad to answer them.|`|maJpBDuvaa	Just tell them as it is. Give them your reasons and support what you are saying with detail. Also, give them some time to soak up the information. You cannot expect them to just get it right away. It'll probably be a big shock for them.|`|YjhlhUzVaa	I understand wanting your family's support but ultimately it is your decision.  Do your research and make sure you get the job you really want in the military and that you understand what that job truly entails.  Recruiters aren't your buddies, they have a job to do and that is to get you to sign the contract.  Read some books and talk to people in the service.|`|5o2uLA9Taa	Go talk to a recruiter, there is no obligation but you will get a pretty decent sales pitch. You may discover that its not what you thought it was.     On the other hand you may decide its exactly what you're looking for and having taken the first step your mom may see that as a sign of you growing up.     I'd recommend talking to recruiters from all the branches of the military. Each has a little something different to offer.|`|085qYCdDaa	I think if you undecided on what you want to do the Navy is a good choice or you going active duty or reservist. Either way they will pay for your schooling. Do you have brothers and sisters or is it just you?Can you live a way from home for more than 6months(active duty)???? What are your goals both in the civilian world and Navy?What ever your strongest interest is what the recruiter will go buy. If your not sure go reservist and get a job on the outside of the Navy and go to school and let the Navy pay for it as long as you have passing grades. Finish school get a degree and if you like the Navy go for the Officer rank, good luck and God Bless the USA!!!!!!!!

OiAl6w48aa	If its a valid court order (even if information on it is incorrect) then the bank MUST accept it and execute that order.  If they don't, then they could find themselves subject to some nasty liability.      As for the information blotted out, that is called "redacting".  Most states have laws requiring certain personal information to be redacted if it will appear in the public record (ie, social security numbers, bank account numbers, etc.).      As for the part about you owning a home, are you sure that isn't just an allegation?  Or perhaps a question to the bank about a possible mortgage?  Either way, I doubt that matters since they are levying your bank account in this instance, not real property.    Edit: Sea, you're getting caught up on issues that do not have anything to do with one another.  If the person presenting the information and order to the Court knowingly lied about relevant information, then they can get in serious trouble.  However, that does NOT simply invalidate an otherwise valid and lawful order.  And more to the point, a claim about whether or not you own your own home has nothing to do with a levy upon a bank account.      If the Court has been lied to as you believe, it obviously doesn't know that otherwise the order wouldn't be in place.  The bank doesn't know that either.  It is up to you, as the person on the receiving end, to safeguard your rights.      You should consult a local attorney to see if there's anything that you can do.
AA11494150	No, you can make an agreement with the court on when to pay. If it is a large amount, they will usually allow you to make regular payments over time.

gvukdlOjaa	No, you can't.    Sniper school is for military personnel from the rank of E-3 to E-7.  All other ranks waiverable through the Course Convening Authority's approval, but I highly doubt they would use up a slot for an officer, Ringknocker or not.    Additionally, only 3 MOS are authorized to attend US Army Sniper School:  11B, Infantryman; 19D, Cav Scout; and CMF 18-all SF MOSs.    There's a reason officers don't wear their marksmanship medal on their Class A's:    1.  They have more important things to do (or are supposed to be doing), instead of shooting.    2.  If they have to start shooting, you're in deep do-da anyway.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Officers would supervise a sniper(s) but not do it.

HgdQMWuDaa	The Impeachment Process     1.The House Judiciary Committee deliberates over whether to initiate an impeachment inquiry.  2. The Judiciary Committee adopts a resolution seeking authority from the entire House of Representatives to conduct an inquiry. Before voting, the House debates and considers the resolution. Approval requires a majority vote.  3.The Judiciary Committee conducts an impeachment inquiry, possibly through public hearings. At the conclusion of the inquiry, articles of impeachment are prepared. They must be approved by a majority of the Committee.  4.The House of Representatives considers and debates the articles of impeachment. A majority vote of the entire House is required to pass each article. Once an article is approved, the President is, technically speaking, "impeached" -- that is subject to trial in the Senate.  5. The Senate holds trial on the articles of impeachment approved by the House. The Senate sits as a jury while the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial.  6. At the conclusion of the trial, the Senate votes on whether to remove the President from office. A two-thirds vote by the Members present in the Senate is required for removal.  7. If the President is removed, the Vice-President assumes the Presidency under the chain of succession established by Amendment XXV.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Impeachment comes first.

These will typically at least begin as public hearings so those with cases can have them heard. If that committee makes a recommendation for impeachment, it will be voted upon buy the House and then the Senate.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Impeachment is a two step process.    1) The House of Representatives vote on"articles of impeachment" which are the actual charges of "high crimes and misdemeanors" the president is being accused of committing.    2) The president is next tried on these crimed by the full senate with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding as judge.  All of the senators vote on the actual conviction of charges which will compel the removal from office.    It is like a criminal trial where the House of representatives acts as the grand jury deciding on what charges the defendant will be tried for.

The House of Representatives prepares the case against the President and makes charges to lay before the Senate, which conducts the trial.  It is not like any legal trial you may have seen before.  The Senate can make make up it's own rules on evidence and witnesses without any consideration for legal precedence.  It is the Senate that determines innocence or guilt.    The other way requires you to probably give up your own life in the attempt.  'Nuff said.|`|RvMguG2saa	Both, I think. I'm not really sure... All I know is Congress, lol, I don't know which house.

Did you know that the KKK (Ku Klux Klan) is planning on assassinating him? No surprise there. Well, we'll just have to bite our lips and see what happens. I don't want him to die, by the way. I'm just saying that he might not be the best president ever and that someone's planning on killing him. It's not ME who wants to kill him; I would never do such a cruel thing to a living being....

He will spend most of his first term cleaning up Bush's incredible shytpile of a mess.

Bailing out the mess that Republican Presidents leave behind them.

At least these are being caught before they can do any real damage. Obama needs to revamp his vetting process, that is crystal clear. But when talking about crooks and scandals a Republican would do well to remember the unbelievable number of them that came to the forefront during the last 8 years.

What has he changed you ask? well first off, he stopped to pay raises in Government offices.  In my local government their was a Republican "bonus gate" scandal where the Republicans passed a bill to give themselves large pay raises. It needs to stop now.  He eliminated gifts to the white house, and he's working on an economic recovery plan that is even favored by some of the smartest of Conservative economic analysts.

In this nation's history the tide had turned with the bold occurrence  of a miracle-- a new star was seen on the horizon and work began to bring this once-great nation to a new and shining place of prominence in the struggle of mankind to reclaim it's former glory and for all citizens of his nation to stand as brothers in arms to save the human race and promote a harmony of global existence.|`|FCypOfDdaa	Change: obama promised change in our country, and i copmletely believe that is possible.  he is going to be the downfall of our country.

ZvfUQ4Ifaa	a good officer would lead from the front, but most likely you will be at the platoon level, and likely travelling in a command humvee near the middle of the convoy. as an officer you will be less likely to die in battle, thats just statistics, but if you werent so preocupied with dying, and were concerned about your marines dying, you will be a better leader. Thats not to say u should put troop welfare first, because mission always comes before marine welfare, but try to adopt the mentality that your there to LEAD them, not to hide behind them|`|gAGMLfnmaa	bro first off saying that you know you are a warrior and havent even been commissioned yet is the stuff that gets your *** kicked, officer or not.  you wont be deployed after you graduate. you have to do a work-up with your unit.  it depends on what plt you are the LT for on what 'lines" you are on.  dont you pay attention, there are no "lines" in this war. its all a mess. butter bars are more likely to get sniped though. since you sound kind of naive and a little too moto you'll probably work in the S3 or something. or thats what you should hope for bc how you sound now you are gonna fragged by your own guys.  anyways good luck man but you need to seriously consider how you look at yourself. "warrior" you gotta be kidding me bro? oh yeah and ive never seen a 2nd LT lead his brothers into battle before. come back to reality SIR|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Depends on what you do.|`|AA11858035	You'll be in the front with your men.

You want to be a Marine 2LT and you don't know squat about what you will do.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Butterbars tend to have by far the shortest life expectancy on the battlefield. That's in part because of ignorance, but it's also largely because they lead from the front. That isn't to say you should plan on fighting the enemy: it's your job to fight your platoon. But there you are, with your butt easily accessible to fire.|`|QusnnfZZaa	You have a lot of training to do before you are ever deployed; depending on your job you might already be promoted beforehand.    Officers lead the enlisted, and you might not ever see combat also depending on your job.    I realize you're still a civilian but howdare you value your life over your men and womens life? Yeah it's scary to think about dying but how can you be a good leader unless you're first willing to do anything you ask of your troops? You might need to reconsider becoming a marine if you want a safer place than your troops.

In the US, they are legal in most states, but illegal for concealed carry in a few states unless you are a security guard.    I would try to look up the other nations laws, but that is many different languages.

If you are not deemed as competent after the two years, then the probabionary period can be extended until the constable is seen as significantly improved enough to become substantive or they are let go.|`|a4f625e9943640ad9aec7382d7bcfe89aa	2 years|`|8hAhmlJjaa	Probation periods vary from agency to agency.  At mine, it is 1 year probation, and the probation pay is only 5 percent lower than when you are off probation.  It can be done.|`|2elJq4THaa	Probation period is 2 years.    I couldn't tell you the exact rate of starting pay without looking it up at work and I don't use Yahoo answers at work.  However, you do get pay increases as you go through your probationary period at certain stages.  This usually equates to about 1000 a year extra if I recall correctly.|`|ArA83jFbaa	I went from a sgt in the air force to the police and found it to be ok, some other jobs are less paid and in this economic climate, stability is the key.    There's always overtime though.    As said probation is 2 years but can be extended if you are not competent ( doesn't happen much).
SYZQZGesaa	You will receive probation right there on the spot. They will arrange a 90-120 day probation in which you make set payments each month. You would not have a typical probation officer that you must report to each month. You will simply make your payments and you will be off probation as soon as it is paid in full. This is all assuming you do not have a history.

8hAhmlJjaa	A civil situation normally does not involve police.  An ordinance violation is something like littering.  Sounds like you committed littering.  Or, at least your friend did.      Try this, first call the courts and ask to speak with the prosecutor to work this out.  If you get no where there, then call the officer to see what he can do.  If nothing comes of any of that, check in about 2 months to see if there are any outstanding warrants for your arrest for failure to appear in court.  If none, consider it gone.  Last option would be to find a lawyer who would straighten this mess out for you at a reasonable price.|`|ftELrRJraa	Skip the officer, deal directly with the court.  If nothing filed with the court you got a lucky free pass. Make sure the court has your correct address, or a criminal citation could result in an arrest warrant if you failed to respond.  It would be worth while to check back after a period of time for follow up.
T0pkW783aa	No, companies are not required to offer paid vacation time but, if you are lucky, you have that option.  In today's economy, many of the things we used to have offered to us are no longer available.  Health care coverage is costing the employee much more and covering less; overtime is required when necessary and people are happy to get it, if it isn't offered often.  Some get no sick time which is paid; some have no vacation but have to take a day without pay when they are ill.  Those who have a job are grateful to have one and are not complaining since so many have lost their jobs and are looking for any means to pay their bills.  It is a different world and it is time to be thankful for the good fortune to have a job despite the cuts in the  perks.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	No, why would you think that?

If he lives 30 minutes from your house then he doesn't require a leave chit to visit his child on weekends or days off.  So therefore he will not lose the leave earned.

It really depends on what he does, if he is getting ready for deployment then he can be really busy.  If he is working at Basic then he can really be busy and not have much time off at all.

UaSb84BOaa	From all the soldiers/airmen/seamen that I've known - male and female - the Air Force is definitely the physically easier of the two. Mentally would depend on your job or what you choose to do while in.   As far as benefits (advancing rank) you should talk to a recruiter about the steps needed for both. I believe (and this has been years ago since I knew) you have to take a test in the Navy for advancement against everyone else in your rank and job. This can prove difficult for advancement if you are not completely on your game. I believe advancement in the Air Force is faster.   Again, your best bet would be to talk to a recruiter. Either way, the military is not easy. Expect that. It should be tough as you are enlisting to protect this country and those beside you.   Good luck!|`|22tPNksKaa	My grandfather was in the Navy in WW2 & pancaked his Avenger into the flight deck. My dad was in SAC in the Air Force and barely missed getting shredded by an exploding jet engine.    In the Navy, you get cramped ships, some UNDER the water, potentially drown, get seasick. Go MONTHS before seeing a port. Plus yu really gotta know how to swim!    In the AF, you might crash in, or get crashed ON. a plane. But at least your on terra firma.    I recommend the USAF. Flying a Predator is a blast. Some say war isn't a video game. I beg to differ. ^_^|`|72a29394374017ab0f3283babed0be66aa	The navy swims. The air force doesn't. Any other difference is meaningless.|`|yVYhN6swaa	Navy is more challenging physically and mentally. Air Force is well known for having classy ladies. not that the Navy dosent have classy ladies its just more per capita in the Air Force ask any military personel|`|94e15f24e84cf947ca201e7a537e4f7baa	The Air Force is the smart man's decisionn when joining the military. Bing on a boat for months ata time would be wack too. My cousin just got out and was in the Navy.. said if he would do it all again.. hewouldn'tt or would have went into the air force. Your best bet would be to go to college first and use your degree to get more $$$$ when enlisted and also progress through the ranks faster.|`|aQKTSU8iaa	Most people don't know that the Air Force basic training just got tougher and longer a few months ago. If you're looking to have a trade when you get out, go in the Air Force. Also, deployments over seas usually last like 4 months for the Air Force. The Navy is also a great choice but you do spend months at a time on a ship at sea. The Navy also has cool hats.....|`|AA12168457	i believe air force basic training is slightly easier than the navy's but in the navy you get to travel all around the world, thats why i want to join

809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	If I were you I would probably go with the Navy. You are proably less likely to wind up in a war zone, more likely to wind up sleeping in a bed at night, and you're likely to spend more time stationed in places that, for lack of a better word, don't suck (Think San Diego vs. the middle of Texas). I think the pay may also be slightly better.    Ask.com (I think it's ask.com) has a very extensive page on joining the military that does a great job of answering just about every concieveable question you might have about the services.|`|FRh06arTaa	This is like asking whats better chocolate or peanut butter its totally a matter of choice of what you want to do. but if you are just one of those people who are thinking of going into the navy for the seals i think you need a reality check, there are numerous options for both branches it all depends on your preference and what you want to do for a job. i think you need to do some research if you are seriously looking into joining either of these branches. Don't talk to a recruiter yet either hes just gonna keep calling you if you are not sure on the branch you want. do some research, pick a branch then go see a recruiter when you are sure which one you would like.|`|hERbZ7yjaa	It depends on what you want.      ALL military branches are inconsiderate when it comes to family. Let that be known. Both have nice bonuses.      Navy is more "militant" than the Army. (after the Marines, naturally)      Army you can go more places because they're more land based. Army you deploy alot, sometimes 8-14 months, but less frequently than the Navy. Navy you go on cruise for months at a time and more frequently.      You have more respect in the Army basic training than in the Naval basic.       Your first two years in the Army are about proving yourself. You can move quickly through ranks in the Army. The Navy is a tad more finicky.      All depends on you as a person and what you want.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Go Navy, we beat Army the last 7 years at football.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	GO NAVY! be proud!|`|PJLmAnTbaa	It really is up to you, my friend.

6sjphNcPaa	it's been down hill since November 4th. This country is in deep horse sh*t!    Part of his problem is that there were such high expectations that no one could live up to them.

I think he still has some tricks up his sleeve we have yet to see, so I wouldn't count him out yet.  Those around him aren't doing much to help him between tax blunders and a fairly one-sided House stimulus bill that throws in everything and the kitchen sink, but does little to stimulate the economy.  I would like the promise of fixing government to trump throwing money at the same old problems without placing any conditions on it.|`|2g7niBEIaa	Yes, his approval rating is in a nose dive.

2YLjd9uSaa	There would be a 10-year bar for being ordered removed if it was the first removal. 212(a)(9)(A)(ii).    If there was a conviction for identity theft, that would trigger a life time ban because it is a crime involving moral turpitude. 212(a)(2)(a)(i)(I).    Any unlawful presence in the U.S. would result in another ban, for either 3 or 10 years. 212(a)(9)(B)(i).    Add immigrant without an immigrant visa, 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and the deported person would have quite a few grounds of inadmissibility to overcome.

uXtonVN4aa	i totally think so b/c babies dont ask to come to this world to suffer. there should be a law that people should have to meet certain requirements to supply a child a good home.     maybe the government should have all girls on birth control if they are sexually active (esp. if they are minors) or something.    i dont believe its a natural right b/c some people cant cut out for it, and plus teenage girls suffer through many physical pains b/c their bodies arent ready to carry a child...sure they have the eggs for it but girls dont finish maturing until 18. Its a social strain to take care of an unwanted child, many end up dead, have poor self-esteem or abused     no one can completely prepare for a child but one should be able to care for it without the help of welfare as only income|`|e5VUwaRsaa	It would be ideal, but sperm and eggs can't sign up for licenses.|`|vqgGKWagaa	no, because you should not control people's lives. Yes there are accidental births, but some of these are welcomed and the children grow up very happily. Then you get some families that look perfect from the outside but are abusing their children behind closed doors. It is against human rights, since when did the world have to be controlled to the point of whether or not you are allowed a baby, it's a natural right.|`|AA12146958	No we do not need more government interference in out lives. I dont think it would stop any of the things you mention anyways.|`|szxLuuONaa	i think you should have a social security number...at least. maybe an IQ test. maybe a source of income? maybe not in high school, or middle school. any or all of those guidelines|`|VXMD953maa	well no because no one has say so for what you and your body does.and abuse doesnt have to do with birth or anything...and some times its not because they dont want a child...some abuses are on accident....like starving and stuff.....and some dont know how....and i disagree with the license.like you would have to go somewhere and get a lincense to have a chid?ok?|`|gzpM24CCaa	Oh yes, and lets sterilize all those that don't pass arbitrary tests for some ideal standard of parenting.  While we're at it, let's have designated puking zones as well.    Personal liberties are a jolly good thing, I think.|`|FbOykHq9aa	I think it should be called a marriage license.  Actually W/M should not be allowed to get married until they have at least one child together.  Maybe let them have a probationary license for 3 years first, automatic end of probation upon prove of birth.
i8yanqUAaa	Of course it is!  Why?  Because of history: Europeans invaded several regions of this  world to conquer and thus to exploit the earth's resources, and not only for exploiting the earth's resources but also to exploit the indigenous population.  Back in times, non-european peoples were not viewed upon as humans, thus they could be used for slave work.  Further, european countries were in a race to be the country most influential in the non-european world to be the most wealthiest country in Europe (and logically,in the whole world).  That's the way, how exploitation began and europeans became the wealthy people of this world.  They certainly did win wars over the indigenous population since most peoples of the earth weren't always waging wars,had different morals and religions and thus didn't develop weapons of wars like europeans did.  Through all their war technology europeans could keep indigenous people in place.    After some time, many peoples of the world were trying to get rid of the european invaders/settlers (colonization) and many independence wars were fought.  Many succeeded,....somehow (others not at all).    Now, mostly people of european heritage are in charge of the most important jobs in the third world countries, even when they aren't and more or less indigenous people are in charge of it, they try to copy the colonists life styles and don't care for their people (e.g. massive corruption).    Nowadays, another striking element is that many "multinational" companies are giving "work" to those people.  The truth is that they are giving them barely anything to live,they have no rights and no security,...their work is cheap to bring the first world cheap products.    The managers furthermore don't give a damn for the people, the more capitalist their economies (no government intervention in third world countries....shouldn't this be a paradise for some?)  the better, but what comes with pure capitalism is only a chance for wealthier countries to exploit the people.    (And it's true tax payers' money is going over there,and works,too but that's not there fault,it's actually the fault of multinational (western,european,U.S....etc.) companies.  The governments of the world are almost helpless.)    Now some final recomendations:   Look up: colonisation,conquista, imperialism and globalism.    Again:It's not hard to see, look up history,look up the news, look it all up....why do you think only 10% of the world's people got almost everything, and the rest almost nothing?  (and no,it's not because they don't work,and no,it's not because the west is so good and generous,and they just are dumb, and, no, it's not because they like the way they live and no, the west is not the sanctuary of freedom and peace.)    Peace.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	You need to separate the US and Europe from this question, and focus this question upon the international bankers and the conspirators that our politicians are bribed to deny.|`|4d4ad126cb9f6297171d0aa263e7d425aa	That is surely true for the UK.

Nayeli ~ Your retelling of world history was as informative as learning about American History in Disney's Hall of Presidents.

bd63392dda83587abd5834e2e866557faa	The common phrase...war is hell.     Everyone has a different perception of the experience in war. War is survival. You are placed with a mission and your job is to accomplish it no matter what. Mission first. However, this does not mean to throw yourself or your fellow Soldiers underneath the bus.    My first time firing a weapon at another person was in Iraq. I was with the 3rd ID/2nd BCT. There was an overwhelming amount of the Al-Quds brigade in the city of Nassariyah.  During a firefight alongside with 3/7 CAV, I found myself in the open with an RPK firing at my teams M1114.  I had a MK 19 on my truck.  I unloaded a barrage of 12 rounds toward his position. All I remember is not seeing them there anymore. The 40 mm created such a cloud of smoke and flame. I just threw up. It was my first time. My body just forced it out. The training had paid off though. After that, I came to realization that it was either them or me.     During my other tours in Iraq, I found it easier to control my weapon and my reactions. Your job is to eliminate the threat at all costs. My M-4 had the M68 sight on it. It was like fish in a barrel. I just couldn't think about it. Just do it. Scurrying through the streets of Sadr City and in the clustered buildings of Fallujah, you had to survive...and so did your enemy. So in the perspective, it's hell.     God Bless Uur Troops!|`|6CfYiabAaa	I am not in the military nor have I had to make the decision them or me. I am however an army wife. My hubby has told me few stories and they are not pretty.

Obama stated to Chris Wallace that he set an "extremely high bar".   Bill Richardson, Nancy Killefer, Ton Daschle, Timothy Geithner and Eric Holder - seems to me the bar has been set extremely low.  Oh.  Then Mr. Obama had to ask his aid two weeks ago on whether or not "he" - the president - had any executive orders about rules of interrogations.  These are EXECUTIVE ORDERS Mr. Obama.  At a minimum, you should know what your doing in office. You don't need to know the details but you should know what PRESIDENTIAL ORDERS you have on the table.  Do you really do anything other then party Mr. President?  Sounds to me we have a President who is in way above his head.  But then again, why should we expect anything less.  Obama has never led anything.  While in the State and Federal Senate, he basically did nothing.  During the campaign, he had to stay on a teleprompter so that he would not say the wrong thing.

t0c1pXm8aa	Yes we should. This is not the way to simulate anything. You do not simulate the economy by helping out the rich you do so by helping out the middle class and poor. You give a rich man 100,000.00 and he will invest it or just put it into the bank. You give the same to a middle-class/poor man and he will spend it and stimulate the economy.   This package doesn't even have a Tax cut it has "Tax relief"   We need a business man as President not a DAMN politician. That is the only way to get out of debt, run this country as a Business.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	Hollywood is a major export of this country, in a time when nobody wants to buy much of anything that we make. You may not take movies seriously, but overseas they pump a lot of money into the USA.    Global Warming is a serious issue, and we have a president that believes in science. It needs to be addressed.    There's money for the NIH, Center for Disease Control, beefing up our electrical grid, and other worthwhile programs that I'm sure you'd call "Pork".    Haz - if you give a rich man $1,000 and he puts it into the bank, that is NOT economic stimulus.

"I cannot and do not support the package on the table from the Democrats and the Obama Administration. Our country does not need just another spending bill, particularly not one that will load future generations with the burden of massive debt. We need a short term stimulus bill that will directly help people, create jobs, and provide a jolt to our economy.

t3QAaSN9aa	Quite a few of them are probably scrambling right now to review their tax records lest any embarrassing disclosures come to light.  We probably should have such an investigation.

Someone call Joe the Plumber and let him know that although his taxes are going to go up, Obama is o.k. with him not paying his back taxes.  The dems put egg all over Joe's face because of his tax problems, yet embrace these politicians for the same thing (Joe's bill was even considerably less).|`|AA12066574	I think it would be smart politically for all 535 members of Congress to volunteer for an audit.

c4c96e87c5e65ad49a7ec667dfb9d974aa	If the old personality is 100% permanently gone, then yes.    We lock up people for what they do, and the brain is what drives this; the body is merely a tool of the brain.      EDIT:    The second question is much more interesting, and what we're talking about here is akin to the medieval notion of posession, but a more permanent form.  But regardless, I suppose for the sake of consistancy, I'd have to suggest that whoever ended up with the mind of the criminal should be in jail.  However, this presupposes two essential items.  First, the mind of the victim must be gone entirely--not "sharing" the body or anything like that.  And two:  the transfer of minds must be permanent and complete.  Ultimately, if the victim's mind is 100% gone, then he/she is no longer that person, no matter what the body appears to be.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	NO!!!|`|80e3ae95b6d29fa41fd8cde82ec98251aa	Wow!! are you serious?

pRSJrGQDaa	This has no deep root with the linguistics. It is a general legal term. It means whether any equitable claim can be transferred to the shoulders of the defendants or not? Liability is always encountered as a negative concept so far as financial, economic, social and legal systems are concerned. The "defendants" here refers to the persons who have been sued against. The matter/ issue to e decided is " whether as per the case plaintiff/ Applicant, really the wrong has been committed by the defendants/respondents. If so, the liability of penal action stands against the defendants. This is the ultimate thing that'll happen.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, responsible.  Legally.   You have better skills than you think!|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	Yes, liable in this context means responsible or better, 'obligated according to the law.'|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	Killer Queen is correct- In other words "Are the defendants responsible"|`|bHwdZCqXaa	yes it means they are responsible for it.|`|Gezfmghuaa	Responsible is probably the closest word.  In concept, liable means responsible under the law.  The difference is that someone can still be responsible for an action, but not necessarily liable if that action is legally protected or could not be reasonably forseen.

TQYQUNYHaa	Mary Todd Lincoln & you can look up the rest and have fun doing your home work as I did mine a long time ago.|`|4zijn0cgaa	Mary Todd Lincoln from Kentucky|`|lRmhwiYpaa	In 1839 Abe Lincoln met MARY TODD, a lady who was determined to mary the President and hopefully, Stephen Douglas.  Both Lincoln and Douglas dated her at the same time.  Mary's relatives all thought she would mary Doublas because Douglas was far more a ladies' man: he had more personal charm, better prospects, better manners, and better social standing.  He had a deep, golden voice, wavy hair, he waltzed superbly, and he paid Mary Todd lovely compliments.  But Douglas was a known alcoholic.  Mary still really wanted Sephen, so much she even dated Douglas' biggest enemy; Lincoln, hoping it would make Douglas jealous.  Abe and Mary became engaged and had plans for a wedding January  1, 1841. Mary wanted to change Abe-she didn't like the way he dressed.  Abe didn't like her nagging so instead of seeing her three a week he would let ten days go by before seeing her.  During the six months before the marriage, Lincoln became extremely depressed.  He did not want to marry her.  On the scheduled marriage,  Lincoln did not show up.  They found him hours later siting in his office, talking incoherently.  His friends feared he was losing his mind.  Mary Todd's relatives declared that he was already insane and should be put away.  Everyone thought Lincoln would commit suicide.  For nearly two years, Abe ingored Mary Todd completely, hoping that she would forget him.  But she did not, for her pride was a stake, her precious self respecet.  She was determined to prove to her self and to those who has scorned and pitied her that she would mary Abraham Lincoln.  And he was equally determined not to marry her.  In  October 1842 a mutual friend of Mary Todd wrote Abe to meet her at her home for  the following afternoon.  When he arrived, he was ushered into the parlour; and there to his astonishment, he saw Mary Todd sitting before him.  They started seeing each other.  On Friday, November 4, 1842, Lincoln reluctantly and with an aching heart, asked  Mary Todd to be his wife.  While Lincoln putting on his best clothes on the evening of his wedding, and blacking his boots, a little boy rushed in and asked him where he was going.  Lincoln replied: "To Hell, I suppose."  Lincoln best man testified that he "looked and acted as if he were going to the slaughter."  Mary Todd Lincoln was always complaining~always criticizing her hus band: nothing seemed right.  She ridiculed the way he walked, she complained that his huge ears stood out at right angles from his head.  She Even told him his nose wasn't straight, and his lower lip stuck out, and that that he looked skinny, and his hands and feet were too big, and his head too small.  She complained his boots always needed polishing and his collar needed changing.His Table Manners were like a pigs~~~~    Mary Lincoln had the worst temper in Illinois.  One day she dashed a cupt of hot coffeee into her husband's face.  Mrs. Lincoln was violently  jealous.  Lincoln would stay away from her for extened amounts of time as her voice could be heard across the street, and her incessant outbursts of wrath were audible to all who lived near the house.  Their first child was Robert Todd Lincoln.  He was the ony one of four Lincoln children to reach maturity.  Eddie diedt in 1850 at age 4  Willie died in the White House-age 12, Tad (his name was Thomas but his father called him Tad or Tadpole because as a baby he had an abnormally large head::) died in 1871 -age 18. Robert Todd Lincoln died in Manchester, Vermont, July 26, 1926-age 83  Lincoln did not belong to any church, and avoided religious discussions  with his best friends. "When I do feel good, I feel good, when I feel bad  I feel bad, and that's my religion.:"    This is just part of a 17 page essay on LINCOLN   YOU can read the rest at  http://home.comcast.net/~tbrown117735MI/...    I hope this does you some good> as this is very imformative and Mary ends up in a insane aslyum :Put there by her son Robert Todd Lincoln    After she left the White House Mrs. Lincoln got into serious difficulties, and made an exhibition of herself that became national gossip. She took everything she could get her hands on. Fifty packing-boxes and a score of trunks she took. What was in them? Probably mostly trash. She had a passion for hoarding old things. The day she left, nobody came out to say good-bye - not even President Andrew Johnson.     126. Mrs. Lincoln firmly believed that Andrew Johnson, the new President, had been back of the plot to assassinate Lincoln. Mary used every means in her power to persuade Congress to give her the hundred thousand dollars that Lincoln would have been paid had he lived out his second term. When Congress refused she went crazy and denounced all of them as fiends. Congress did give her twenty-two thousand - approximately the amount that would have been due Lincoln had he served the rest of that year. Mary was forced to take in borders to help pay her bills. Mrs. Lincolns campaign to raise money for herself not only failed, it also brought upon her a storm of public condemnation.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Her name was Mary Todd.

Do you still have to pay the rent?  Yes.  It does not matter who has the computer now.  If you are not paying the rent as you agreed in the rental terms, then they can charge you with not paying for a product that you have (or had) and it does not matter if it was stolen from you.    Think of it this way, if you had paid $1,200 in cash for it, and it was stolen, you can not go back to the store and say the computer that you sold me 6 weeks ago was stolen, and since I paid you in cash, I want it back, because I was stupid and left it in my car, where it was visible.     If you keep paying for the computer, then there is nothing they can do to you.  But you refuse to pay for the computer, then they will do what they said they are going to do in your rental agreement.  Read it.  It will probably say they will collect it in court, and that you already agreed (by signing below) that you will pay reasonable attorneys fees, and all court costs.    So save yourself a lot of money, and pay the bill that you agreed to.    Next time consider a LoJack for the computer, it will allow the Police to locate it if it is stolen.|`|z88IMXNFaa	If they think you are lying about the theft, they can call the police.

A local women's support group or association (sometimes domestic violence hot lines can point you in the right direction for child support orders and enforcement).  4.  Make sure you present an accurate financial statement to the court that includes your income, assets, expenses and debts;  and insist that the father produce an accurate financial affidavit as well.  5.  Make sure your request for the Court to order child support, medical coverage, reimbursement for DNA tests, etc. has been properly filed with the Court in advance of the hearing.  6. Make sure you file a written objection to any false statements or improper requests for relief from the father or his attorney.    Also do not be afraid to assert yourself in Court to the Judge (each time you go to court, go in with a written list of your objectives with reasons for each objective to remind yourself not to forget to explain each point to the Judge).  If you have witnesses to attest to specific facts, bring them with you. Although you need to present yourself as respectful of the Court, you might want to point out to the Judge the irony of the child's father being willing to spend a considerable amount of money for legal services instead of for child support, child care, diapers, etc.|`|AA10628838	There are court appointed lawyers for criminal cases not civil cases.

If some info is missing and you really do need to fight his attorneys, a court-appointed or legal aid attorney should easily be able to ensure you get the support you need.  If, after talking to the appointed attorney you're not comfortable, you should be able to find an attorney that will counter-sue so that he's responsible for your attorney fees.  You can at least get a free consultation to discuss the possibilities.|`|WxbPOmrFaa	I would suggest not to let it slip by or put off for too long because they might cancel it later, saying that you supported his for the nine months, that you'll be able to do it in the future.
