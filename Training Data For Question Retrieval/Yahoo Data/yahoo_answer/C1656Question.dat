20090226110020AAlCtKF	Travel;United Kingdom;London	Was the London Blackfriar Bridge ever painted?	I'm doing a research paper on color psychology, and I've recently come across information of the London Blackfriar Bridge. The information told me that the London Blackfriar Bridge was originally black and that there were many suicides because of it, and thus it was painted blue or green (two different sources told me two different colors), but on further research I've only been able to find one death on the Blackfriar Bridge. If this is true, then the statistic that the suicide rate dropped by 34% after the bridge was painted couldn't be true, because the suicide was later labeled a murder. So I'm wondering, was THE Blackfriar Bridge painted, or is there another Blackfriar Bridge that fits the information more accurately?

I plan on going to the parks from monday to friday. Will it be busy then? I know most colleges, but not all, have spring break the week before that. And where I am from, elementary schools and high schools don't have break until April.   So I am wondering, will the crowds be light during the week? Or do the southern schools have break during this time or will college break kids be crowding the place?   Also, does anyone know how the economy is effecting Disney attendance? I personally got a great deal on flight and hotel, so i don't know if that's a sign that they're struggling or if they're just going to attract more visitors. IDK, just trying to plan how it's going to be.   Any advice would be great :)

20090226142651AAutaWw	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	Where in the Philippines can I get free immunization for my child?	Where in the Philippines can I get free immunization for my child who is about to turn 3 months old on March 18th 2009?      She has already reaceived her BCG and 1st Hepa B injection on December 19 2008. This was given to her for free just before the hospital released her to my care.        On her 2nd month, Feb 18 2009, I got her immunized again with Hepa B(2nd shot), DTP, Poliomyelitis, H.influenza type B all-in-one shot. Only this time, my private pediatrician was the one who administered it. It cost me 3800 for an all-in-one single shot and 2 more shots of this all-in-one vaccine is needed to complete her immunization.        According to my Pedia, on her 3rd month I can either choose between this orally administered immunization for diarrhea(not sure about the medical term for this)and immunization for pneumonia. However, the immunization for diarrhea has to be given before the child reaches 3 months of age. She is charging me 3000 for the diarrhea immunization and 5000 for the pneumonia. Also, both of them has to be given 3 times in separate occasions to complete the immunization.        So lets calculate how much money I'm going to need so far...    All-in-one shot 3800p (needs to be given 2 more times, 7600)    Diarrhea immunization 3000 (3 times, 9000)    Pneumonia Injection 5000 (3 time, 15000)    Other Vaccines...(Hepa A, Typhoid, PPV, etc.) Price: I don't know yet    Grand Total of: 31600 +++        As you can see, its all too expensive for me to be able to afford at the moment. I care a lot for my baby and I would like to give her the best but my family is also going through a financial crisis right now and we all have to be frugal with our spending. I would prefer that my baby gets the kind of immunization that wouldn't cause her too much discomfort afterwards...so Id like to know if the vaccines that are given for free are of the same quality as those given by private pediatricians. I would appreciate any information contributed by anyone about this. Also, please help me locate a clinic where they give free immunization around Q.C. or at least within NCR, as I truly am uninformed. Thanks in advance!      And one more thing...    I cant seem to find any relevant results about this one on google and on tanikalang ginto(could it be cause I am not entering the right keyword? I know I've tried many combinations already). Most articles I have read so far only covers the different types of immunization given to a newborn and the need for Filipinos who are on the lower class or middle-lower class to be aware about it...but I haven't found any information so far on where to get them...aside from the generalized "I got them from our local health department"...but which local health dept. exactly? I hope someone informed can address me about this. It'll be much appreciated! :)
