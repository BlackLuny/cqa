The program is for swimmers who want to stay in shape during the off season. The only difference between me and the swimmers who have also signed up for the program is that I don't swim during the season. I'm nowhere near as good as the people I'm going to be training with, and I need a lot of help training before I go and do this. I've been running about 3 miles everyday for about a week now, and trying to eat healthier, but I'm not sure if that's enough. I can't do butterfly and my dives suck! There are no open pools I can practice in, and I'm nervous as hell for this. Is there any thing I can do to prepare for this a little more, or am I doing enough  already? Should I warn my coach about my skill level, or just let him/her find out what to do with me when I start? Help or advice would be greatly appreciated! :]

Utley: .292/.380/.535   Howard: .251/.339/.543      Utley plays a more difficult defensive position.      Utley is arguably the best defensive 2nd baseman in baseball, and undoubtedly top 5.   Howard is in the bottom 10 for defensive first basemen.      Utley had 14 steals and was caught twice.   Howard stole once and was caught once.      So Utley...   Hit for better average   Got on base more   Slugged about evenly   Played a more difficult position defensively   Played his position better   Did more on the basepaths   ...than Howard      Why did Howard get 2nd and Utley barely crack the list?

The hoops are of smaller dimension and height in comparison to basketball hoops. They also contain no backboards. The court is divided into thirds which regulate where individuals in each team are allowed to move, and two semi-circular "shooting circles" at each end from within which all scoring shots must be taken.      i am asking for reasons why netball is better not football, and i'm not asking for your opinion on which is better, please people i'm being serious.

20090225155037AAKDfbL	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Do you think outfielders are bad?	There's a misconception between the people at my school that the infielders are the best and softball outfielders are worth nothing. I for one play center field and sure, we don't get as much action as infield players, but I think outfielders run the most, have to throw the hardest, and have a lot of pressure on their shoulders. If you're an outfielder, you're the last line of defense, so if it gets by you, everyone else is screwed. However, many people think that they put 'sucky' people in the outfield.      What's your perspective on this?

20080330233617AAhwr43	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	A quand de vraies sanctions sportives ?	La banderole parisienne samedi.   La Marseillaise régulièrement sifflée.   Le jet d'objet sur les joueurs tirant les corners à Marseille.   Le pétard lancé sur le pompier.   Les bagarres etc etc...      Qu'en pensez vous ? Je souhaite des sanctions sportives lourdes, car les sanctions financières ne riment à rien, elles sont noyées dans les budgets faramineux des clubs. Par exemple, on retire la coupe de la ligue à Paris (donc pas de coupe d'Europe). Un hymne est sifflé, on décrète l'annulation de tous les matches amicaux à domicile pour l'équipe incriminée. Cela se reproduit, on lui interdit la participation à la prochaine compétition. Seules des sanctions sportives lourdes peuvent assainir les stades qui en ont bien besoin. Sarko a d'ailleurs oublié son Karcher samedi, à mon sens il aurait du refuser de remettre la coupe lui même.
