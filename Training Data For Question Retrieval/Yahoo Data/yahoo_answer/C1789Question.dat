She said  and i quote ""For certain he knows that he is not straight up black , but do you believe that other races considers him to be a Mulatto, I don't think so. As far as other races is concerned he is black or African American"" Now when she said "other races" I am sure she ment the black race. and in my experience with talking to people and from what i see on T.V. and the web, she's not the only one that thinks this way, almost every Black person i see and hear say about the same thing.. and its BS,, how can you ""not signing out any one"" say just because he has some black in his background that just because he's president, that it's a memorable moment and huge step for the black community..

Will Mail Delivery Get Cut to 5 Days?By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, AP   posted: 53 MINUTES AGOcomments: 21PrintShare   Text SizeAAAWASHINGTON (Jan. 28) - Massive deficits could force the post office to cut out one day of mail delivery, the postmaster general told Congress on Wednesday, in asking lawmakers to lift the requirement that the agency deliver mail six days a week.       If the change happens, that doesn't necessarily mean an end to Saturday mail delivery. Previous post office studies have looked at the possibility of skipping some other day when mail flow is light, such as Tuesday.       Faced with dwindling mail volume and rising costs, the post office was $2.8 billion in the red last year. "If current trends continue, we could experience a net loss of $6 billion or more this fiscal year," Postmaster General John Potter said in testimony for a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee.    Total mail volume was 202 billion items last year, over 9 billion less than the year before, the largest single volume drop in history.    And, despite annual rate increases, Potter said 2009 could be the

20090128161823AAKjB75	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Criticize This article" A New Start for National Service"?	A New Start for National Service       By JOHN MCCAINC AND EVAN BAYH    Published: November 6, 2001      Since Sept. 11, Americans have found a new spirit of national unity and purpose. Forty years ago, at the height of the cold war, President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to enter into public service. Today, confronted with a challenge no less daunting than the cold war, Americans again are eager for ways to serve at home and abroad. Government should make it easier for them to do so.       That is why we are introducing legislation to revamp national service programs and dramatically expand opportunities for public service.       Many tasks lie ahead, both new and old. On the home front, there are new security and civil defense requirements, like increased police and border patrol needs. We will charge the Corporation for National Service, the federal office that oversees national volunteer programs, with the task of assembling a plan that would put civilians to work to assist the Office of Homeland Security. The military will need new recruits to confront the challenges abroad, so our bill will also improve benefits for our servicemembers.       At the same time, because the society we defend needs increased services, from promoting literacy to caring for the elderly, we expand AmeriCorps and senior service programs to enlarge our national army of volunteers.       AmeriCorps' achievements have been impressive: thousands of homes have been built, hundreds of thousands of seniors given the care they need to live independently and millions of children tutored.       Since its inception in 1993, nearly 250,000 Americans have served stints of one or two years in AmeriCorps. But for all its concrete achievements, AmeriCorps has been too small to rouse the nation's imagination. Under our bill, 250,000 volunteers each year would be able to answer the call -- with half of them assisting in civil defense needs and half continuing the good work of AmeriCorps.       We must also ask our nation's colleges to promote service more aggressively. Currently, many colleges devote only a small fraction of federal work-study funds to community service, while the majority of federal resources are used to fill low-skill positions. This was not Congress's vision when it passed the Higher Education Act of 1965. Under our bill, universities will be required to promote student involvement in community activities more vigorously.       And for those who might consider serving their country in the armed forces, the benefits must keep pace with the times. While the volunteer military has been successful, our armed forces continue to suffer from significant recruitment challenges.       Our legislation encourages more young Americans to serve in the military by allowing the Defense Department to create a new, shorter-term enlistment option. This ''18-18-18'' plan would offer an $18,000 bonus -- in addition to regular pay -- for 18 months of active duty and 18 months of reserve duty. And we would significantly improve education payments made to service members under current law.       Public service is a virtue, and national service should one day be a rite of passage for young Americans. This is the right moment to issue a new call to service and give a new generation a way to claim the rewards and responsibilities of active citizenship.       John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, are United States senators.

Most of the animals have been shot at point blank range.      "The first thing the Israelis did was shoot at the lions - the animals ran out of their cage and into the office building. Actually they hid there."      The zoo in Gaza opened in late 2005, with money from local and international NGOs. There were 40 types of animals, a children's library, a playground and cultural centre housed at the facility.      "There was not a single person in this zoo. Just the animals. We all fled before they came. What purpose does it serve to walk around shooting animals and destroying the place?", asks zookeeper       Inside one cage lie three dead monkeys and another two in the cage beside them. Two more escaped and have yet to return. He points to a clay pot. "They tried to hide", he says of a mother and baby half-tucked inside.      Is this what Zionism is all about?  Is this the ideal of the Jewish State, to which US taxpayers send $13 million PER DAY?  Is this the Israel of God?
