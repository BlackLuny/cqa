tqu2SALHaa	Well i would think this is just a Hormonal Rage, Allthough you have finnished maturing, i do think this is a Hormanal Rage, They develop, around these ares,    Right under the Niple Skin,  In the at the Anus,  Near Spine,  Neck,  and other places, but give it about 3-4 months to calm down, try not to play with it leave it be, i get many cases where people come in and they think they have breast cancer but actually its just this. If it does not clear up go to your Doctor and tell him/ her.    But if you want anymore information, contact me on    markm2k8@hotmail.co.uk|`|i3pn4jNcaa	possibly a cyst. does it look like a big pimple? if thats the case get a hot compress (wash cloth with HOT water) & press it on. if its a cyst itll instantly burst & all the puss & good stuff will come out leaving your back pump free.
QGSNWq0zaa	sinus drainage during the night, and dry air     are you a back sleeper who sleeps with your mouth open?    the dry air causes the coughing, the sinus drainage causes the throwing up  together a bad combination,   try using a menthol disc in the shower each morning, or invest in a humidifier, or try sleeping on side or stomach, or propping you head up, also look into nasal strips to open nasal passages, so your mouth will be more likely to stay closed and moist during the night|`|AA10096628	ok sounds like 2 things, your sinuses are always bad and when you sleep it drips to the back of your throat, you may have a deviated septum.

You don't need to tell her to lose weight, she already knows.  She might be disgusted about her weight.  So don't tell her about weight, till she mention about it.  It's when, you can help her by checking into diet and exercise programs or some regimens.  Don't risk your relationship by giving a touchy advise.  If you can't love her because her weight, you can tell that fat women turns you off.  If you are worrying her health, tell her the truth that too much of excessive fat in the body will ruin her health and that you want her to live long life with you.|`|kDxljPUnaa	Excuse me. But isn't that what long walks are for?  Or in your case, REALLY LONG walks.|`|5QQbJ9Cdaa	She obviously knows she's overweight and the worst thing you can do it point it out to her.  If she has indicated that she wants to lose weight, the best you can do is encourage her to do so.  Sometimes all overweight people need is someone to help them and encourage them to lose.  You can help her start slow and go with her grocery shopping, maybe you can help her choose healthier foods.  Take her out for walks in the park, every little helps.

Plus it makes you work harder for it.|`|RQVMxZLEaa	My gym instructor told me that its better for your joints to run on an incline rather than on flat ground. I don't know if its true but id hope he knows what he is talking about, lol|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Depends what you're looking to do. Obviously when you run uphill, you can't run nearly as long as if you were running on flat ground. That means you burn less calories, but because uphill offers much more resistance, you'll work your leg muscles harder and probably develop more muscles vs losing more calories.|`|BKOgIfwHaa	running on an incline is definitely better for you and I actually find an incline way easier than a flat run. Just be sure to incline slowly and lots of fresh water with you. This ia also something i have been using and recommend as well as a life long believer in the benefits of grren tea (all variations of it).|`|0Dbjv10iaa	Yes. Its way more beneficial. Its much harder to run uphill than on a flat ground.|`|Lb5u2aJqaa	Yes, definitely.  And, ouch!!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	it uses more calories and muscle if that's what your aiming for|`|FX4obiYmaa	yes  because your forcing your muscles to move and work harder to "get up" the hill.   as it is easier to go down hill.  i guess its all in gravity or something, idk
6de8798c6bf528620ad52ef6ce0d9893aa	A lot of people claim that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, the only studies that have been done have shown an ASSOCIATION between people who consume lots of artificially sweetened foods and beverages and overweight and obesity, but they fail to show any CAUSALITY.    Association is not Causation! -Plus saying fat people use more aspartame and splenda than thin people is like saying sick people use more medicine than people that are well.  It would be fallacious thinking to assume that it must be the medicine that is making them sick.    My personal anecdote, I recently lost 35lbs over a five month period and I drank lots of beverages with aspertame and splenda every day, during that time my blood pressure and liver function improved. I don't credit artificial sweeteners for those effects but to me it seems that their use had no negative impact on my project to improve my health.|`|1MxrzBLMaa	Yes you can gain weight from it because its got sweatners in it! x|`|xRTjy9xIaa	ya it does very bad for u.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Yes, since this has a sugar sub in it and this makes our crave other sugars so we eat more.

Not sure who gave me thumbs down but if it was for this answer you are so wrong.

YDykVkcmaa	You may be told to undertake a HARD exercise regime. This will actually reduce your t-levels. So be very wary of any type of extreme workouts. The secret is to build your plan slowly and steadily.    When it comes to t-boosters just be sure that you're not being sold a vitamin/mineral concoction and/or some sort of plant extract that is claimed will build muscles incredibly fast and you'll be a new man within days - it's all crap.    The best way to build muscles is to increase t-levels and to exercise at the same time to take advantage of that testosterone.    This can be done in a number of ways and you seem to be doing the right things. But I'll restate some here;    1/ Moderate exercise (build slowly);    2/ Don't smoke or drink (alcohol is a real t-killer) as these both interfere with t-production;    3/ A balanced diet that has your daily requirement of Zinc (zinc is critical in changing estrogen into testosterone and preventing testosterone from being converted into estrogen (female hormone).    The problem may be that you have low t-levels and that is holding you back. A simple blood test can solve that one. If you find that levels are too low then there are a large number of possible treatments. The following link will describe them all for you:    http://www.hormonesolutions.com.au/conte...    If all that fails then find a bio-identical hormone cream (I use AndroMen Forte) and use it as directed.|`|ez5BjZdRaa	you working out wrong. You need to work out only a certain group of muscles every other day. Or if they still hurt skip that day. say monday, you do chest, tri's and back, legs. next day abs and biceps, shoulders. repeat that process one more time that week, equalling four days. Then drink whey protein unflavored, follow the directions. Its important that you drink a dose 40 minutes beofre working out and 40 minutes after. You need a gram per lean pound in your body. If you weigh 200 just drink like 180 grams a day. ALso drink zinc, it stops the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. And it also increases testosterone production. Drink Chromium, around 200MCG per day. burns fat and increases muscle growth. Drink estrogen blockers and balancers, here's two good ones, calcium d-glucarate and DIM (Diindolymethane) and another thing if you wanna get built, do high weight/low rep. the last set, for example for bench put on 2 25 pounders and just burn yourself out to get good blood flow in your chest and tri's. Every six weeks take 1 week off. Everytime i do that i comeback doing more weight. because it is important not to over train. and not to over do it. it becomes counter productive and your muscles do NOT grow. And you just stay the same size. And eat alot of GOOD calories, avoid junk food. but eat complex carbs, and alot protein.  Max sets you should do is 4 sets per muscle. 5 reps per set. But do HIGH WEIGHT. that way you rip.
6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	Wow. You sound exactly like me!  Sometimes the stress just makes me want to scream and cry.     I take 20-30 minutes a day to run. It's an incredible stress reliever. Try it ... you can start walking first if you have to, but don't worry about what time. Just get out and do it. Tell yourself -- SELF, DO IT! And do it.    Insomnia and headaches - two advil and a benadryl at bedtime works great. I get about 5 hours of sleep a night. ALSO -- if you drink coffee, give it up. Takes about 3 hours to get rid of the withdrawal headache, not two weeks like some people say. And you'll feel much better, sleep better, be more relaxed, and have fewer headaches.    Take just a couple of a minutes every day to just slow down, literally. I'm always dashing around, so it's hard to to, I know! Move slowly, walk slowly, take your time - doing anything around the house. Back off in traffic. Make a conscious effort to S L O W down a little. Stress flows away. Then you can speed up again, but you feel energized.    Try not to let the OCD bother you, as long as it's slight. You'd be surprised how many people have it. As long as it doesn't interfere with your daily functioning, just let it be. I have to do some things in order, repeatedly check the clock and the locks ... it's okay. I can live with it.    That's all I can think of right now!   I hope some of it is helpful.

It does, however, leave you groggy the first few times you use it. Just be prepared the day after, to feel a little woozy. The Lunesta won't "knock you out", but it will keep you asleep.    I also tried the OTC stuff from Wal-Mart and Walgreens and it gave me restless legs. Bad mojo.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I used to take Ambien, then I got so dependent on it that I nearly had to go into rehab. I would try an herbal remedy if I were you.|`|In1UqryNaa	A presription called Ambien will.  It can be habit forming though, but defnitely will knock you out especially on an empty stomach.  I take it only when I need to sleep for something very important the next day.|`|Aej3lgQZaa	A frying pan to your head.    Depends on what you mean by instantly, but there a few drugs that are OTC, very cheap, and work within 30 minutes.     I prefer to use antihistimines.     The main ingredient of over-the-counter sleeping pills is an antihistamine. Antihistamines are generally taken for allergies. However, histamine, a chemical messenger in the brain, promotes wakefulness, so antihistamine also has the effect of making you feel very sleepy. Some OTC sleep aids also include a pain reliever.   Common OTC sleep medications, with a link to Medline Plus drug information from NIH, include:        * Diphenhydramine (found in brand names like Nytol, Sominex, Sleepinal, Compoz)             * Doxylamine (found in brand names like Unisom, Nighttime Sleep Aid)    OTC sleep aids are meant to be used for short term insomnia. Tolerance to the medication, meaning that you need a higher dosage of the medication for it to work, can develop in only a few days.     Doxylamine is used in the short-term treatment of insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Doxylamine is also used in combination with decongestants and other medications to relieve sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion caused by the common cold. Doxylamine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Doxylamine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.    Diphenhydramine is used to relieve red, irritated, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; and runny nose caused by hay fever, allergies, or the common cold. Diphenhydramine is also used to relieve cough caused by minor throat or airway irritation. Diphenhydramine is also used to prevent and treat motion sickness, and to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Diphenhydramine is also used to control abnormal movements in people who have early stage parkinsonian syndrome (a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance) or who are experiencing movement problems as a side effect of a medication. Diphenhydramine will relieve the symptoms of these conditions but will not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Diphenhydramine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Diphenhydramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.    But other sleep aids are:    Benzodiazepines are the oldest class of sleep medications still commonly in use. Benzodiazepines as a group are thought to have a higher risk of dependence than other insomnia sedative hypnotics. All are classified as controlled substances, although newer formulations attempt to lessen the effect. These drugs are now less frequently prescribed than non-benzodiazepines. Primarily used to treat anxiety disorders, there are several benzodiazepines which are FDA approved to treat insomnia. These include:        * Estazolam (ProSom)      * Flurazepam (Dalmane)      * Quazepam (Doral)             * Temazepam (Restoril)      * Triazolam (Halcion)    Non-Benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics    Some newer medications dont have the same chemical structure as a benzodiazepine, but act more specifically on the same area in the brain. They are thought to have fewer side effects, and less risk of dependency, but are still considered controlled substances. One medication in this class, eszopiclone (Lunesta), has been tested for longer term use, up to six months, in clinical trials.        * Eszopiclone (Lunesta)      * Zalepon (Sonata)      * Zolpidem (Ambien)    Melatonin receptor agonist hypnotic    This medication mimics the sleep regulation hormone melatonin.  It has little risk of physical dependency but does have side effects. It is used for sleep onset problems and is not effective for problems in staying asleep.        * Ramelteon (Rozerem)|`|iASdeAdJaa	drink 5 shots of jack daniels in a row|`|SLTlvqRlaa	Take piriton drowsy.

B8WEoAiKaa	Types of HPV that affect the skin can be passed on by skin contact with an affected person. The types of HPV that affect the mouth and throat can be passed on through kissing.Genital HPV is usually spread through intimate, skin to skin, contact during sex.You can have the genital HPV virus for years and not have any sign of it. So it isn’t unusual to have a long term partner and then be told you have the virus after medical tests such as cervical screening. Many people then worry that their partner has been unfaithful, or will think they have been unfaithful. But finding out you have HPV doesn’t necessarily mean that you or your partner have been unfaithful. There is no way of knowing how long you have had the virus. It could be weeks, months or years.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	There is no way other than sex that you can contract the Human Papaloma Virus. You have to come in direct touch to touch with someone with the virus. The virus causes genital warts that have to be removed as soon as you find them. This is because many times they begin to grow cancer cells that can spread into your vulva area, into you vaginal canal and the cervix. The HPV virus is the leading cause of cancer of the cervix. He had to have gotten it from having sex. Once the virus hits the air it is dead. You have to have regular gynecological checks as you can have a wart in a place that you aren't aware of.  Now there is the Gardisil vaccination for young girls that prevents them from getting the virus. Once you have it there is no cure. But some people with a good diet and vitamins have been later tested as free of the virus. Until then you have to be extremely careful and use protection so as not to transmit the virus to a partner.  You can have it and not be aware of it, but it is found with a pap smear which every woman should have once a year.|`|31faac01721214eb794c4aeec80604b5aa	he got it from a girl who has HPV|`|t0fefYawaa	Many many people have HPV and have no symptoms. Only a few actually get genital warts when they have HPV. It's spread through sex, which you probably already knew, but you can get it through skin contact. What that means is you can still get it even if you use a condom or if you don't have penetration. The only way to really prevent yourself from getting it is abstinence. You wouldn't believe how many people actually have HPV and just don't know. The only bright side is, most people never have symptoms. Women with HPV should get regular pap smears though because some strains can cause cervical cancer.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is an STD.

pfm0wcEIaa	You may just need to drink a glass of water or eat a good meal.  When you are upset you may forget to do things like that.    In response to your more broader question, YES.  Sadness, stress and depression can cause serious, even life threatening illnesses.  People who suffer from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  have a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases than those who do not suffer from PTSD.  And type II diabetes has been associated with lack of sleep and stress.    When you are sad your immune system takes a toll.  This makes you likelier to get an infection.  If this sadness and depression is severe and persists for many years you may develop a serious illness because of it.    With that said, you should also make sure that your problem is not the other way around.  You may feel sad because you just don't feel well.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Some studies show that stress coming from sadness and a general "not taking as good of care of yourself" (at least as well as you normally would) can have a notable effect on supressing your immune system.

Usually it's more of an emotional illness that sometimes turns into physical (eating disorders, cutting, ect.).     I'm really sorry about what happened with your mom. :( Is she still abusing you? If so, you need to tell someone. She has no right to treat anyone that way and something needs to be done. I was abused by my mom also but I didn't tell (mostly because it didn't happen often). You need to most somewhere else because it's only going to hurt you more and more the longer it continues. Find a trusted adult that you can confide in or a friend's or family's house you can stay at. Is your dad around to talk to?     About the headaches, if you've just had the headache today and you usually don't get them often, then I would just say it's a normal headache. If you've been getting them often since you were abused, then it could be from that. Headaches can come from many things though. It could also be stress. Have you been eating and sleeping enough? Maybe you should go to a doctor about it.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	You need to talk to a counselor at school about this. Probably your mom was abused (I'm assuming this is emotional abuse?) when she was a girl, didn't get counseling for it, and now she is passing it on down to you, since it's all she knows.  So your mom isn't wicked, I'm sure she loves you, but she is dysfunctional in some way. I bet family counseling would really help you two out.      One help I can offer you is to go use a free computer program that will teach you cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.  Here is the link:    http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome    It was pretty funny - i have finished lesson 1 only, and I laughed out loud like 3 or 4 times in the 30 minutes or so that it took.  Research shows that computerized CBT is almost as effective as seeing a counselor, and it's free, and anonymous!  (The program is offerred by Australian National University).  CBT helps you identify negative thinking that makes you sad or anxious or angry etc. and change that type of "warpy thinking."      Good luck!

When you're sad and mad, things can actually start to hurt, like you can get tired and lethargic or get a headache or just feel like crying for hours.|`|0n0zw1Sfaa	you probably ate bad sushi...    as far as i know i dont know if that is true, but possibly. everyone is diffrent and every one has a diffrent body so i think it could be possible    i cant wait to check back on this answer and see a doctors post just tearing me to shreads on how stupid i am lol|`|r88L6kZNaa	Aww, I'm sorry you have to go through that.  I really don't know.  The only illness I know you can get from sadness, is depression.  But I don't know.  I wish I could help.|`|zqfs7A6Caa	Yes, it is called a psychosomatic illness. The headache is real though, so take an ibuprofen and get a bit of rest. Most people would recommend counciling, but I don't know if that would help. Just work hard in school, stay off drugs and try to find a positive peer group to help keep your mind off your home life. If you don't have a church, find one and talk to some of the other teenagers there..that can be your counciling.    In two years you can move out on your own. You have survived this long, so just hold out a little longer and you can do whatever you set your mind to. Just don't let any bad influences stand in your way, or else you will find yourself still sad when you are 25-years old, blaming your mom for your wrecked life. With hard work and dedication you can make a permanent escape from your situation when you turn 18.|`|D6fhFdWiaa	You become what you think.  If you enjoy sadness and dwelling on it, and continually live like that, with sad thoughts in some way gratifying a sense of yours, then yes definitely.  Seek help before it not only becomes clinical depression, but a sickness you can be jailed for.  Like hurting your children to get self pity etc|`|79b3d0f8c17037a2e4a5a3f573d4598faa	yes well stress can cause illness.try and think positive.relax etc...write things down.that can help u put things straight in ur mind.its not gud for u too hold sadness in.u need too talk to somebody u can trust.its not nice too feel sad.a gud cry always helps me...tc and try not too worry.hope u get things worked out!

The time limit doctors put on it before considering you as possibly having a fertility problem is one year of trying regularly with no success.  However, if you've been on the depo shot, it could easily take longer while your system returns to normal.  Then again, it may not.  Only time will tell.

How I got over it?  Stay indoors for a week.   Keep warm.  Don`t do hard work in the house.  Drink lots of fluids.  Take extra vitamins.  And if you like, get some licorice or coughdrops to suck on, they suppress the urge to cough.    If after this week it still is bad - consult your doctor.  If you are really worried, consult your doctor today.|`|8Jwe8ODOaa	could be bronchitis or a sinus infection. You should go to the doctor they could at least give you some decongestants or an antihistamine if they dont think this is a bacterial infection.
j56eqPxvaa	If you wan't it to go away NOW, use some kind of product like Clearasil or Proactiv. It's also normal for "symptoms" of puberty to last a looooooong time.|`|zgBelCROaa	maybe never. try taking really good care of your skin.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	Have you tried using Acne treatments? See if Products like Proactive, Ambi and Neautrogena works for you!<br>  <br>  Good luck.=]|`|WjESRTiKaa	Acne is a menace. However, it’s not something that cannot be tackled. There are loads of acne skin care products around. We can classify acne skin care products into 3 broad categories – <br>  * Preventive or general acne skin care products<br>  * Over-the-counter, specialised acne skin care products <br>  * On-prescription acne skin care products. <br>  <br>  The general acne skin care products are the ones that are used as acne-prevention measure. These include cleansers, make-up removers and similar products that help prevent acne. In the real sense, these acne skin care products are just those that should anyway be part of your daily routine. However, some of these are more oriented to act like an acne skin care product. These acne skin care products act against the causes of acne e.g. limiting the production of sebum/oil and preventing clogging of skin pores. Basically, these acne skin care products prevent the oil from getting trapped in pores and hence hamper the growth of bacteria that lead to acne. The general acne skin care products also include exfoliation products like skin peels. These work towards removing dead skin cells, hence reducing the possibility of pore-clogging and bacteria development.<br>  <br>  Then there are specialised acne skin care products that are available over-the-counter i.e. without the need of a prescription. These include products like vanishing creams which extract the extra oil from the skin. Most of these acne skin care products are based on benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, both of which are the enemies of bacteria (and hence acne). You should start with a product that has lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide (e.g. 5%) and see how your skin responds to it.  Alpha-hydroxy-acid based moisturizers are also popular as acne skin care products. You might have to try a few, before you zero-in on the acne skin care product that is effective for you. If nothing seems to work, you should contact a dermatologist. <br>  <br>  On-prescription acne skin care products are the ones that are prescribed by a dermatologist. This can include ointments that can be applied on the affected area or oral antibiotics or just any topical treatment. Dermatologist could also suggest a minor surgical procedure to remove the contents of pustules.  However, never try to squeeze or do this by yourself, it can lead to permanent damage of your skin.  Your doctor could also prescribe a hormone-based treatment (since hormonal changes are also known to cause acne). Such acne skin care products are known to be very effective in some cases.<br>  So, with all those acne skin care products, tackling acne is not that difficult.|`|eDJWs2zxaa	just try using skin treatment, see your doctor, its a lot about your diet just eat healthy stuff|`|RpsLJNzVaa	about when you are about an adult. over 21+|`|prvdZlH4aa	my brother is 15 almost 16 and he has had acne 4 like 2 years n he puts proactive n just burns them n he scratches them n stuff so i have clean and clear n it works great n im13 so idk bout age n puberty so dont squeeze er pop em ok ??? n dont eat chips n pizza n alotta mayo n dont drink soda

s0HTHGd4aa	I agree with what the other poster said, it's time to get to a doctor.  Your problems sound more emotional than physical, but it's best to maybe see both a PC and a psychiatrist/phycologist to see what is going on.    I don't know your age, or if what your feeling is situational or just out of the blue.  If your in your mid to late 30's it could be peri-menopause, if your in your teens it could be puberty or just plain hormones.  We are women and we're governed by our hormones, which suck! Lol.    Please call your doctor.  You will feel so much better at least just talking to someone!!!  Good luck!|`|zBKUS5hxaa	It's time you went to a doctor to find out what's wrong with you.  Some of your symptoms are serious enough to justify seeking a qualified medical opinion instead of asking here.  Having said that, you might have a thyroid problem, but let your doctor check you out.  The treatment could be as simple as a supplement or medication.  Take care.|`|LhCHYGwKaa	Hypochondria, by the sound of things.    lolz.|`|PhNzEkVnaa	A good bit of this laundry list can be chalked up to low blood sugar and dehydration.  Start eating seven small meals with  protein everyday and drink plenty of fluid.  I would bet about half the symptoms go away.  Get some exercise and you'll sleep better.  Stop thinking about "coping" and just get on with things, live your life don't dwell on whether or not you "can" cope.  You really don't get a choice so just do it.  Everyday you are given a gift, you can either do it right or pitter it away by wasting it.|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	A lot of those things sound like symptoms of depression. You should check with your doctor to see if s/he can help you out. good luck
lSaCUg0yaa	Why don't you buy a home pregancy test and find out for sure.|`|oy7mNHJNaa	Sounds like a major UTI.  All of the symptoms you've described are typical of a sever urinary tract infection.  I've been pregnant 3 times and it has never caused blood in the urine, only bad UTI's.    The only way to know for sure if you are pregnant or not is to take a test.  You can get them for very cheap at dollar stores and it would be worth the peace of mind to know.      I hope you feel better soon!  Keep taking those meds.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	With all the other symptoms you're having, I would venture a guess that the vomiting is a part of the UTI.  Some people do experience this.  And even if you are pregnant, the antibiotics won't hurt anything so keep taking them.  If it were me tho, I'd still call my doctors office and explain to the nurse what's going on and get her opinion.|`|1yqucDzaaa	It sounds like a UTI to me. I've had many UTI's in my time and they can have horrible horrible symptoms that last for days.

t81MEJ82aa	As the other answerer said, a portion is about the size of the palm of your hand. Also you will be less likely to overdo it at dinner if you eat more throughout the day. Another way to consider is having a glass of water before you eat (and/or while you're eating) and after so that you feel fuller.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	A portion of meat shoudl be about the size of your palm, I woudl recommend around that same amount for the starch and double that for the vegetables|`|rno44kAUaa	Im sorry but u got 2 cut out the steak. one 12 oz steak can have up to 60 grams of fat. stick to the chicken
gkqmrIAGaa	You have to see a psychiatrist for a correct diagnosis as nobody on this site can diagnose you. A psychiatrist can treat you with the right safe medications that will change your life for the better.  If it is Bi-polar you should know that it is a disease just like diabetes or heart disease and requires medication. No matter what anybody tells you there are no natural cures the same as diabetes or heart disease it requires specific prescribed medication. You have nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about. You should really be ashamed of yourself if you don't get the help you need that can change your life. You don't have to suffer with this. I am telling you with many years of experience with the disease of Bi-Polar and success with medication.  It doesn't get better it gets worse without help. I hope you will get the help you need soon. You don't deserve these feelings.|`|TprIqGhCaa	Speak to a psychiatrist.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>I don't want to go see a doctor, because I'm embarrassed of this.<br>  <br>  See one. Now. What you're describing sounds like a manic/depressive cycle, and you need to get it under control as soon as possible, even if that requires that you take medication to stabilize your brain chemistry. I've known someone who had a similar problem, and believe me, mental illness is one of those things that you really, REALLY want to nip in the bud, because if you don't, it can get much worse, and last longer, and be more difficult to fix. It is not, I repeat NOT, the kind of thing you can 'deal with on your own', and the worst thing you can do is convince yourself it is.|`|XsNqpRWwaa	if there has been a traumatic event in your life recently then you might want to go talk to someone,  or unless you really have soem kind of history to back up these types of feelings. other than that i can chalk it up to one thing. which is usually your menstural cycle. i usually get very emotional around that time too, very sad and feelings of not belonging etc etc. lots of the same symptoms you may have. if you are feeling this way, the first thing is you should check if youdo, so talk to a therapist, but if the feelings go away soon enough, then just be prepared for the next time with some re assuring thoughts. cognitive thinking is the key to mental happiness|`|f19c8f60e4f00e1419d732994fddb327aa	Sounds bipolar. Definitely see a psychiatrist. There are anti-discrimination laws for people with mental health issues, and you *have* to see a proper mental health specialist, because these disorders can be *dangerous*. Moreover, if you go without treatment, you are hurting more than just yourself. I have a friend whose mother, sister and aunt are all bipolar. The mother, who is in treatment, maintains a relatively normal lifestyle, while the aunt has attacked her husband with a knife, and the sister regularly disappears (sometimes for weeks), is in serious debt (because of her manic spending sprees), and has become addicted to various illegal narcotics.<br>  <br>  It is not pleasant to live with an untreated medical condition.

94x6nKtlaa	It's probably a cold sore. Once you get the virus it remains dormant in your body until you are under stress (from your cold, etc.) You can treat it with abreva or another over the counter medication.|`|I8MUpN04aa	it is a cold sore. you can get medicine from the drugstore to get rid of it, they have Abreeva (very expensive) and Blistex makes one that works well (much cheaper) the Blistex one is in a little round blue tin and it says on it that it is good for cold sores and fever blisters. get it and just keep putting it on the sore, it should be gone in a few days.|`|BvE0qcgmaa	I had the same thing happen to me when i Was sick.

BREATHE!! just pick out a style you like and its all good. elaborate a bit on why you are so afraid though. will your family and friends think less of you if you have bad vision? if so, there's nothing you can do about it, so you should let them know that. if wearing glasses really bothers you that much though, you should definitely consider contacts. i personally think that they are difficult to handle because sometimes you could forget about them and fall asleep with them on and trust me, you don't want that. something bad will happen to your eye,  im not quite sure but you don't want it.<br>  another thing, don't lie to the eye doctor about what you see, that will just make things worse than they actually are. just relax and answer everything honestly.<br>   if you do have to wear glasses and you don't want to, then just deal with it. you have to get used to them some way or another.

When it's the time it will be just fine.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Supposedly, crunches don't work to reduce your waist but core exercises (with those huge rubber balls) are supposed to help.  Also doing things like biking where you pedal normally for a few minutes then do a slow count of 15 seconds of manic pedalling as fast as you can, then slowing down to normal for 5 mins, then manic pedaling (altering back and forth for 30-45 mins or however long) are supposed to work.  And big busts are not all they are chalked up to be--someone once told me that "anything more than fits in a hand is just a waste."  And as you get older, the bigger busts (even the ones that aren't real big) do get pendulous and baggy (plus, from what I hear, difficult to sleep on).  You should be focusing on just getting yourself as healthy as possible (and btw, congrats on recovering; it's not an easy thing to do and takes a LOT of will power).|`|qm2NVoTUaa	whats wrong with a big waist, its how you were naturally made and its what attracts men. i think you should leave the little belly fat alone.

Try warming some olive oil and pouring a small amount in then seal the outter ear with cotton wool not pushing it into the ear. If u regularly use sotton buds to clean your ears u may just have compounded the wax in further, try using a product like cerumol that will soften wax then get your Dr. to syringe them.

EOZsYlZkaa	Generic drugs are always cheaper than the brand names, because the companies producing generics did not have to put out the money for research and development and clinical trials. Having said that, if generic Fluoxamine is expensive, it is because it is expensive to manufacture. I don't have the time right now to do a search, but there are on-line pharmacies that sell all drugs, generic or brand, cheaper than what you will find at your local pharmacy. You will have to do a bit of research to make sure that the company is legitimate, but I'm sure you can find it cheaper. I hate to say it, but "ask your doctor". Of course he/she may be in cahoots with the local pharmacy.

Most out grow self consciousness by the mid 20's. What this means that your problem is not weight, it's that you are too concerned about what you think others will think of you. <br>  <br>  The best thing is to start reading books about self image psychology. An old stand-by is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz. Should be in any library or you can get it on Amazon for about fifty cents. Everyone should read it at some point in their lives--just skip over the parts that are a bit advanced for you and focus on the stuff he says about self consciousness. <br>  <br>  Now as far as what you eat, the following has been useful to many other teens.<br>  Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or your half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>  <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Be healthy and well,<br>  <br>  Richard K|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Eat more protein foods (fish, chicken, nuts, beans) for metabolism and muscle health.  More vegetables for fibre to fight fat tissue.  Stay away from sugar foods, and sugar drinks.  Walking is a good exercise, 30 minutes a day or more.  Carry a back pack for extra weight and burn calories.  Push-ups for upper body tone and strength - in your room before you go to bed.  Snack between meals on protein foods - chicken, some corn or peas.|`|lc9nus8taa	well to me it sounds like your a pretty normal weight but its good to eat healthy and exercise any way.<br>  <br>  just eat 3 meals a day and morning tea and afternoon tea. just eat 5 servings of vegies and 2 fruits eat wholegrain for breakfast (like weet bix,porrige,musli,weeties or cornflakes or wholemeal toast) don't eat anything like nutri gran, fruit loops or coco pops full of sugar. drink light or reduced fat milk.<br>  <br>  here are some good ideas for meals<br>  vegie and beef/chicken/pork stirfry with rice or noodled delish<br>  pasta<br>  salad<br>  rissoto<br>  fish<br>  meatballs and salad<br>  wraps etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  and just find someone that you enjoy like dancing,bikeriding,or running or join a club|`|C7CueNxbaa	You should eat less protein to increase muscle and don't eat or drink anything between breakfast, lunch and dinner except mineral water. Don't skip breakfast, lunch and dinner or eat to little because when you starve, your body will actually increase body fat rather than decreasing it. Don't try to hard because you're still too young.|`|sSctu8GGaa	you first start by jabbiing a tooth brush down your fuckin throat, then you dont tell anybody then you drink a tea spoon of water a day, and eat 1 potatoe chip crumb every sing day! that gotta do u some good! also its very healthy compared to other diets, you only get in the hospital like 5 times per month! the other diets get u in the ospital like 13 times times per month, trust me i would know!|`|OTIpSy1Daa	ugh. don't listen to those jerks. <br>  what you need to do is look at your diet. are the foods you eat good for you? Cut out junkfood and most sweets. go for more fruits and veggies and lean meats. <br>  for exercise do cardio 3x a week and strength training 2x a week and rest on the other days. make sure you exercise for atleast 30 minutes (if your a begginer) or you could go up to 1 hour a day if your already active. but don't do too much too soon, you could hurt yourself. <br>  when you exercise, make sure you are doing enough. when you start to sweat then you start to count minutes. If you don't exercise hard enough, it'll just be a waste of your time. <br>  I'm sure you can find workout videos or borrow some from the library.<br>  Or you can go to a gym or just buy your own weights at a thrift store or something.<br>  Good luck :)|`|teUtTMoUaa	the best guideline is simply to eat less and consume fats and starches in moderation. be sensible about what you eat and when.  cut fast food and heavy sweets. eat breakfast and don't eat a large meal late in the day, because your body will convert food it doesn't need for energy into fat. i don't advise a diet that eliminates fats or carbs altogether. while cutting either one WILL make you lose weight, both are necessary parts of your diet and long-term health problems can result. also, exercise is key to any weight loss plan. you don't need to pump iron 3 hours a day, but try to walk when you can and keep active. finally, drink lots of water instead of sodas!|`|K0c6yq3caa	First of all, <br>  there is nothing wrong with you; i just checked your BMI and you are healthy weight.

Trust me. <br>  If anytthing, if you want to get healthy just make sure you eat your 5 pieces of fruit and veg a day, eat carbs,proten etc and exercise regularly. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps xx|`|upx2bF4Waa	I don't exercise a lot.. and I love eating.

No ice cream or candie or salt.. Little is always okay but everyday is a no. With you exercise you should have 100 to 200 crunches and other exercises like that( more exercises below. You should eat 2 servings of fruit at least and meat. Not too much butter. Think about eating less too. Stop eating when your still a little hungry. If you do that for a while your body will get used to eating less and you'll get skinnier. <br>  Hope that helps!

fv2GAAdPaa	Well Netrougena has some good products but try proactive and see if it helps you with your acne or try Ambi and see if it helps.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	I would say Electrolysis, however this may be too pricey depending on whatever you wanna get treated.|`|r8nYndkgaa	I answered a question similar to this before, so I'll just copy/paste what I said:<br>  <br>  I met this lady who recommeded this one natural indian remedy called safi. I tried it, and I could literally see the difference in my skin in just 1 night. There is only one major downside to this: it tastes horrible. I almost threw up the first time I had it. But it is natural and will not cause the body any harm. It is a blood purifier and although it tastes horrible, it is a sacrifice anybody with acne should make. Drink it once a day and you will see a difference. Drink it twice a day (if you are brave enough) and you will see a remarkable difference! But you HAVE to be consistent - don't skip days!<br>  Go to any Indian supermarket and ask for safi, hopefully they'll have it. This was probably the biggest thing that helped me get rid of my pimples, and it was completely natural. It costs about $7 for a large bottle and about $3 for a small one. I suggest you try the small one first and see what you think of it.<br>  <br>  It is SO much cheaper than Proactive or any other over the counter product. And it is 100% natural. I can guarantee you will see faster results than Proactive too. Also, since it is an internal sort of remedy, you will not have to face dry skin or anything like that. I went from huge breakouts and pimples all over my face to barely any in just a few weeks. This stuff really works.|`|WjESRTiKaa	Acne is a menace. However, it’s not something that cannot be tackled. There are loads of acne skin care products around. We can classify acne skin care products into 3 broad categories – <br>  * Preventive or general acne skin care products<br>  * Over-the-counter, specialised acne skin care products <br>  * On-prescription acne skin care products. <br>  <br>  The general acne skin care products are the ones that are used as acne-prevention measure. These include cleansers, make-up removers and similar products that help prevent acne. In the real sense, these acne skin care products are just those that should anyway be part of your daily routine. However, some of these are more oriented to act like an acne skin care product. These acne skin care products act against the causes of acne e.g. limiting the production of sebum/oil and preventing clogging of skin pores. Basically, these acne skin care products prevent the oil from getting trapped in pores and hence hamper the growth of bacteria that lead to acne. The general acne skin care products also include exfoliation products like skin peels. These work towards removing dead skin cells, hence reducing the possibility of pore-clogging and bacteria development.<br>  <br>  Then there are specialised acne skin care products that are available over-the-counter i.e. without the need of a prescription. These include products like vanishing creams which extract the extra oil from the skin. Most of these acne skin care products are based on benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, both of which are the enemies of bacteria (and hence acne). You should start with a product that has lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide (e.g. 5%) and see how your skin responds to it.  Alpha-hydroxy-acid based moisturizers are also popular as acne skin care products. You might have to try a few, before you zero-in on the acne skin care product that is effective for you. If nothing seems to work, you should contact a dermatologist. <br>  <br>  On-prescription acne skin care products are the ones that are prescribed by a dermatologist. This can include ointments that can be applied on the affected area or oral antibiotics or just any topical treatment. Dermatologist could also suggest a minor surgical procedure to remove the contents of pustules.  However, never try to squeeze or do this by yourself, it can lead to permanent damage of your skin.  Your doctor could also prescribe a hormone-based treatment (since hormonal changes are also known to cause acne). Such acne skin care products are known to be very effective in some cases.<br>  So, with all those acne skin care products, tackling acne is not that difficult.|`|BvE0qcgmaa	first stop touching your face. i know its hard you dont even know your doing it. that will lessen the black heads.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|ZdF1hx70aa	Go for it!

2sycPf8Daa	Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane forming the outer covering of the heart. Pericarditis may cause pain in the center of the chest, which can radiate to the neck or left shoulder.<br>  Pericarditis is often caused by a viral infection. Bacteria, fungi, or parasites may also cause the disease. <br>  <br>  Unlike angina or heart attack, this pain may be "sticking" in nature and worsens with deep breathing, coughing, or twisting of the upper body. Nevertheless, the pain at times may mimic that of a heart attack. <br>  When acute pericarditis is triggered by infection, fever, chills, and weakness also tend to occur. Chest pain, caused by the inflamed pericardium rubbing against the heart May radiate to the neck, shoulder, back or abdomen Often increases with deep breathing and lying flat, and may increase with coughing and swallowing Pleuritis type: a sharp, stabbing pain Usually relieved by sitting up and leaning forward.<br>  <br>  I was prescribed ibuprofen 400mg for acute pericarditis. The use of ibuprofen helps my occasional attack of Pericarditis. <br>  Take care always!|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	pleurisy?

It has to do with what you eat and how much is in your styeam as in vitamins. There is lots of protein and some women will tell you it has a salty taste to it. That i I don't know. I can only tell you what a women taste like and many have sort of a salty taste to them. If one was ot eat plenty of pineapple or oranges it is said to improve the taste but eating meats and things that can cause a bad taste later are not good. That includes smoking and drinking many acholu beverages. Still the color really has nothing to do with age of the sperm or ejaculate, drink plenty of water keep your self well hydrayted. it should be good to go.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	It could be affected by what you eat, do you eat a lot of curry?|`|1fkLC96Vaa	wtf!!! hahaah your sperm is yellow..<br>  <br>  <br>  it miight be the lighting in yur room <br>  <br>  orrr..<br>  <br>  wen yu were materbating/******* uneeded to pee<br>  <br>  orr..<br>  its pee|`|oZpqEdI7aa	it has something to do with urine(i had the same thing, it went away)<br>  go to doctor though if your concerned|`|Cb6BheBgaa	Sperm is not yellow, it is microscopic-|`|sRGPj46eaa	umm, u dont have hepatitis right?|`|QUTI4UIzaa	Don't worry you just need to masturbate more so you get rid of the old yellow and "OFF" sperm. Try doing it twice a day for a week and see if it improves...if not see a doctor because you have too much old sperm...(DOES IT SMELL OFF) >?<
I8MUpN04aa	you cant put any cream on it, it is inside your mouth. you should probably go to the doctor and get an antibiotic to help it heal.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	Use some cream
Fsq9qvkqaa	It is right at the opening. The hymen is a thin membrane that does not completely cover your vagina, just part of it so that your menstural flow can come out. It can easily be torn or stretched doing sports or horseback riding or gymnastics, or by using a tampon. <br>  Hope this helps :]

ehq6W1mtaa	It probably didn't heal correctly because you most likely didn't put it in a splint or fix the placement of the broken bones. You should really go to a doctor and wear a splint so that you don't damage it any more, also you should know that when you break a bone it stays broken for more than a week and that they take a long time to heal, especially if they arn't even lined up right in the first place. If you can't line up the bone yourself you should seek medical help. :) Hope it helps!|`|jiMi6Ihhaa	You should definitly see a doctor if it is still hurting now

0vBAUodNaa	I was sexually abused by my grandfather between the ages of 5-12. It was terrible. I didn't tell anybody, but finally, I came to my mom and told her. You need to tell somebody, I promise you that. Things will get hard, but in the end it will all be better for you. I am 17 years old, and I'm still not over what happened to me. Healing times depend on the person. I am sorry for what happened to you...but you need to speak out. IT WILL GET BETTER!|`|s5i9atFpaa	Sweetheart, you need to get a good counselor who specializes in this.They will help you will all the complex feelings that arise from abuse. A trusted family member, someone from church, or your school counselor should be able to help you get the help you need. <br>         May the angels surround you with their loving protection. <br>                            Best Wishes to You.|`|AA11626362	Talk it out! dont be angry at them it wont do you any good but remeember that karma will get back to them|`|eDKSKqcSaa	There are lots of people who can help you - not easy on your own.<br>  What country are you in?|`|gkqmrIAGaa	You have to see a therapist to help you cope with this. Only a therapist can help or a psychologist. If you don't take care of it now, sweetheart it will cause lifelong problems. There is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Borderline Personality Disorder that can ruin your life. At the least it can cause anxiety disorder and can affect all of your relationships for the rest of your life. I am so very sorry this has happened to you.  You have to tell your mom or another trusted adult now or if you can't do that than your school counselor. You need to go to the emergency room if it was in the last 24 hours. Whoever did this to you has to be stopped as he will continue to do it to others. You can save many others by telling who did this to you. If it was within the last two days I would call the police immediately. You are not going to be able to deal with this on your own. I don't mean to scare you at all, just help you know that you have to get help. Please go right now and tell somebody. Lowlifes like this may have threatened you not to tell but I promise you it is only a threat he will go to prison. Please email me if you need.|`|upvLAyyzaa	I'm sorry to hear that happened to you.  Good job going to the police, that's something that many victims can't ever do.  So I hope he pays big time for what he did to you.  That would be so empowering.  You should try to go to therapy.  It won't help you forget, but it'll help you learn how to cope better so you can move on with your life.|`|1thElV58aa	Talk to your family and therapist, I hope you got the person in trouble who did this to you. Actually it took me years to get over being touched once by friends Dad I was only 3 I was living in Seychelles at the time they got in trouble  but i still remember and  every since that happened i never trusted my friends dads. Talk to someone about it because you know it well never happen again. Keeping it to yourself can get you into a bad depression.|`|wQWTQo4eaa	oh dear i'm so sorry!  when did this happen?  i was raped over a year ago! it has been so hard getting over this!  but what you need to do is go see a therapist!  even going to a support group would help!  what happened will never go away, but getting help will you help you deal with it!|`|a8197d81509b83e4fb506e95d2158deaaa	i was molested and coped with it negatively-cutting and drugs<br>  talk to someone about the situation like a trusted friend or a counseller. it will take a long time to even start to get over it. <br>  I think talking to someone is the best coping method|`|56917efc2d4323a083e26002e4c680fcaa	If you haven't done so already tell your parents and then let them talk to the police. This is very serious. Get some counseling fast or this will affect you the rest of your life.
muHctmaGaa	Don't use cardboard applicators and stay away from scented varieties (they release bad chemicals inside you). I've liked Playtex Sport; it has a differently angled head that goes right in. You might want to try the lighter tampons and change them out more often until you get used to the feeling enough for the larger sizes.<br>  <br>  Maybe you would benefit from an alternative product, like the menstrual sponge: <a href="http://www.pandorapads.com/sponge.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pandorapads.com/sponge.htm</a>|`|yQl4fiJAaa	try to look for some different tampons that say "slim fit" or "junior".<br>  <br>  you may also be putting one in wrong. remember that the tampon goes in at an angle towards your lower back, not straight in.|`|5Ra5xbziaa	try using junior tampons|`|XkuR8ZJPaa	I want to say that I have seen a brand that was specifically for teens but I cannot think of what it is called.  I would suggest trying the light day ones they are generally smaller than the regular ones.  Also they make tampons that are applicator free (OB brand) and they may be eaiser for you to insert but this is a little messier.  Also you have to find the right tampon for you.  I don't know if every woman feels this way but I had to try a bunch of different tampons before I found the ones that I like.  You can go to tampax.com , kotex.com , and playtex.com and sometimes they will mail you free samples so you can try different ones out.  Also Walmart.com has a sample section that  usually includes some kind of tampon.  <br>  Good luck you will eventually get the hang of it!|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	tampax pearl lites (they're the purple ones) they're really little and go in easy especially if you haven't used tampons before. keep in mind that it takes a few tries to get used to putting it in comfortably
c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	It is not appropriate to say 'if you treat it right none' because this is not true.  Type 1 diabetes even when vigorously treated still leads to many complications including a risk of premature cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks.  Remember that diabetes is progressive so even when it is 'perfectly' controlled damage continues to occur.  No one can state for an individual 'how many years' you may be deprived of.  There are too many variables.  Age of onset.  Level of glucose control.  Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  It is possible that your diabetes will not take years off of your life but it is foolish to take it for granted and assume that if your glucose readings are at goal that you will be fine.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|8Vz9JF7paa	Tin S I thin k that is an ignorant answer.... I agree with John and. Tin S this may be true 10 years ago but in medical years this is a LIFETIME.... there are so many medical advances in the world that diabetics type 1 have more of a chance of living a normal life (long and healthy) than ever before... I think the key is do the best you can with what you've got.... and also scientists are working on cures as we speak... stem cell research is looking very promising (my aunt is a top researcher at University of california, in THE U.S) working on a cure :)<br>  <br>  Don't think about it to much...  if you think you will die sooner than you probably will... dont underestimate the power of mind and the ability to write your own scripts|`|iK3YYRaTaa	ON AVERAGE 1/3 OF NORMAL LIFE SPAN. Also 1/3 of type 1 Diabetics die before age 55. Its not a simple cold it for real.

All it means is you have to use your head a bit more.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	Who knows.  Control is key.  Extreme highs or lows can cause life-threatening complications in any diabetic.
OATkKb8Xaa	probably not, just underweight<br>  eat something god damnit!<br>  good luck!|`|WS9TooJKaa	It's not about your weight honey. It's a mental illness.<br>  <br>  Do YOU think you have it? If you're worried so should tell a family member/doctor.|`|jIeQlIq2aa	anorexic is when you have an eating disorder, you either won't touch food or you have very little of it, <br>  <br>  do you eat enough food?<br>  <br>  if so -then you are very lucky to be so thin naturally-i'm a girl|`|vpKhZvYraa	Weight doesn't define anorexia, it's a mental illness. I'd recommend doing a little research about it and seeing a doctor if you think you are. But again, your weight and height aren't the most important factors. It's more about any symptoms you may have, for example starving yourself, eating very little, counting fat content and calories in everything you eat, feeling a constant need to be thinner. That's not all of it and that's not even necessarily anorexia nervosa but it's some of the many many symptoms. See a doctor|`|WiXFkpHyaa	39 kg is quite low for your age and your height. Consider checking your diet or food consumption|`|nkwsRizHaa	You're underweight, I'm not sure if you're anorexic|`|vuAvQobFaa	anorexia is something that people do to themself when they starve themselfs of food and see themselfs in a mirror to be fat the questions you should ask yourself are are you happy with yoursef and how you look do you eat properly i was 24 and weighed 7 and a half stone but i ate better then my freinds who were larger then me and worked hard and also it depends on the bodys matabalisam (excuse my poor spelling) some peoples work faster then others soon you will be going through a groth spert and you will possably shoot up and fill out dont look at others were not all ment to be the same or we would be born that way just make sure you eat properly and generaly look after yourself prperly and give it a few years and im sure you will become a healthy looking man|`|6wW7iLrbaa	Bloody hell! I think so. Your BMI is under 16- this is serious seee a doctor. 18 is underweight.|`|f68b132d151f08e73536f2bd847b98cbaa	Anorexia is not determined by anything other than your relationship with food.<br>  <br>  so no.
QODJNf1oaa	LOL... No you can't, you can get diseases though|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	No, this is not true. The sperm has to go to your vagina and into your uterus. If you drink it, then it goes through your digestive system, which is not attached to where your uterus is.|`|FC5BxnoPaa	No, not possible.  Drinking sperm will do nothing, it will be digested just as any food would.  The only way to get pregnant is by sperm entering through your vagina.|`|TF7gdNPvaa	No.You can get sick and throw up.lol.Or disease.I''m not sure.ALl i know is that you'll throw up and get sick maybe.WHO THE HELL CAME UP WITH THIS?!The only way you can get pregnant is for the sperm to go inside you.Well the guy has to stick his you know what in you.then u get prego.This was a silly question.lol|`|Zirwfsg4aa	absolutely not, the female gentalia aren't connected to the intestinal track, and the acid of the stomach would kill the sperm really quickly.|`|muHctmaGaa	Only if you douche with the liquid.

mAZi1eH7aa	If you do not eat a balanced diet, your body will start storing fats and you will have the opposite effect. That is a guarantee.<br>  Avoid all fatty foods and junk foods. Avoid soft drinks and choose fruit juices (no sugar added ones) and milk and water instead. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Avoid sugar added foods.

AA10299265	No, but I thought I was dying from lactic acidosis after taking Metformin for several years. <br>  <br>  If you're type two, job one should be to get off the meds with proper diet and exercise. If you're type one, I'm very sorry for you and I would recommend following Allie Beatty's blog linked in my profile.<br>  <br>  Can't help you with the insulin thing. It's been my life's goal to stay as far away from injections as I can. My mother (also a type two) didn't have the luxury of the Internet to help her get off the meds. She listened to her idiot doctors and was on insulin in a few years. I was not so unfortunate, I have the luxury of the Internet, and with lots of research, plenty of effort, and lots of trial and error, I have found that type two diabetes does not have to be all that bad. In fact, I consider it a wake up call and am actually thriving now. Much like I was twenty years ago... long before being diagnosed.|`|8OqdoIHtaa	Yes you can die from it. My mom thought she had the flu and it turned out she had diabetes, and was in ketoacidosis. At first they thought she'd had a stroke. The ketoacidosis nearly killed her. She was back in the hospital again last month with the same thing and was even closer to a coma and death. <br>  <br>  If you had ketoacidosis, your blood sugar is running way too high. Its very unlikely that you will go low enough to have a problem when your blood sugar is out of control. <br>  <br>  Always check your blood sugar before you go to bed. If its not under 125 it is very unlikely that you will go too low at night. My endo told me that unless I'm under that number don't worry. If I am under, I can have a small snack before bed, with 15 to 20 carbs, because I'm on Lantus plus a fast acting insulin, which could make me go too low at night. Its not very likely with Lantus, but the fast acting insulins can do it. <br>  <br>  If your blood sugar is lower than 125 and you are worried about going low (when you have better control), you can keep 4 glucose tablets on your bedside table with a glass of water and your meter. If you wake up and think you are low, test first. <br>  <br>  IF you are low, below 70, (or in Canada, below 4.0), then you can take the glucose tablets, wait 15 minutes and retest to make sure it came up a bit. <br>  <br>  Do not treat a low without making sure you really are low, unless you wake up feeling very weak and confused and unable to get up. Then you should take the glucose tablets and test again. To treat a low you need about 15 carbs and glucose tablets are the best way to get it. They are sold at pharmacies. I like Dex 4 tablets, and buy them at Walmart in bottles of 50 for less than $10. Most glucose tablets are very expensive, these ones are a better buy and work great. <br>  <br>  You need to test way more than once a day if you are on insulin. What was your doctor thinking?<br>  <br>  Check out this page about testing, so you can get a handle on it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diabetic-talk.org/jennifer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetic-talk.org/jennifer.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Once insulin is opened and being used, it is fine at room temperature for a month. It starts to lose its potency after that. As long as you keep it under 80F, it should be fine. <br>  <br>  More info, including great links, book recommendations, etc... <br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-NbDgUzQhfrJTXdmg.DfXS.Tx">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-NbDgUzQhf...</a>|`|BnR4LLhxaa	Can't answer much about the DKA, but I do know that both Lantus and Novalog can be left out of the fridge while you are using them - assuming that you will use a pen up within a month.|`|iK3YYRaTaa	100's of thousands. Probably 100"s of millions. Maybe more. I ansered your question . Do I get 10 Points.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	I have never had a patient die from diabetic ketoacidosis but deaths certainly do occur.  Glargine (Lantus) is a basal insulin made by Lilly.  The pen does not have to be refrigerated once it is put into use.  Aspart (Novolog) is a rapid acting insulin made by Novo Nordisk.  As with glargine the Novo FlexPens do not require refrigeration once put into use.  Lilly sells approximately 85% of all insulins in the United States but Novo Nordisk produces approximately 85% of all insulins world-wide.  I prefer the Novo Nordisk FlexPen systems and I believe that there is an advantage to having both insulins from the same manufacturer.  For example - both detemir (Levemir) a basal insulin and aspart FlexPens will be able to use the same needles.  So far as DKA is concerned I fully understand your concern.  It is a potentially deadly condition.  I also agree that diabetes is not a nice disease to suffer from BUT with the new analog insulins referenced above it is now possible for the first time ever to give diabetics the same glucose levels as non-diabetics.  This does not prevent progression of the diabetes and it reduces rather than eliminates the major complications of diabetes such as premature cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks.  I am assuming that you are a type 1 diabetic as they are more likely to suffer DKA.  A type 1 diabetic to achieve proper control needs to monitor their glucose 4 times daily.  There is a recent device that is inserted under the skin that reports continuous glucose readings without the need to prick yourself for a drop of blood.  Studies have found this device to be as accurate as glucometer readings.  Unfortunately - in the US - only about one-third of diabetes are at 'goal'.  This is the fault of the physician and not the patient.  This one-third control is as true for an academic endocrinologist as it is for a rural general practitioner.  The medical literature in recent years has referred to this as physician inertia.  These physicians have their diabetic patients seen every three months, perform the appropriate laboratory studies, record in the chart that the patient is not at goal, but nothing is done.  There is no change in the medical regimen to try and achieve glucose goals.  These studies are troubling and no one has been able to determine just why physicians are 'inert' - why they do not act.  That having been said, I hope that your endocrinologist will be in the one-third who treats you to goal.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|qmk2mIKpaa	Yeah, it does suck but you get adjusted to it and youll be fine =/     first, novalog and lantus can be left unrefridgerated after opening. but after a month ish it goes bad when its been priorly opened.  Um, i dont see why they would send you home without being educated...lantus is a once a day insulin and novalog is to be given with meals according to how many carbohydrates you ate..you should have been given a ratio (like 1 unit of novolog for every 30 carbs) at the hospital or something like that..and i would be worried living on my own too...im only 15 so when i was diagnosed at 10 i was at my house with my parents and brother the whole time. I dont know what K-phos is...? And to answer the main question, yes i almost died from DKA when i was firsts diagnosed...by sugar was over 1000. I have no clue how i was still alive and i wasnt even in a coma or anything...i guess a guardian angel was watching out for me that day =]<br>  <br>  Dont get too scared about diabetes...its manageable and if you control it then it is all okay =] Just keep your head up and keep a grip on your diabetes! You can handle it =]<br>  <br>  I hope all this helps !  This took me quite a long time so i really hope you give me the best answer =] hahaa GOOD LUCK !<br>  <br>  Edit: Whoa, a lot of people wrote more than me...=] But mines better =]|`|8Vz9JF7paa	Hi, Sorry to hear that your feeling so anxious about it all. <br>  <br>  I have type 1 diabetes and have tried lots of different insulin's and found that when i was on lantus because it is such a long acting insulin i wasn't able to control it as well as if i was using short acting insulin's like novo rapid. Im on a pump and it gives you the freedom of eating almost anything you want (even though its better if you stick to a healthy diet) the pump also allows you to hook up a sensor. So in turn this means that you can turn the sensor on overnight and set alarms... alarms for when your blood sugar is going to high like over 14 or if it is dropping to fast or below a certain figure like 4.... <br>  <br>  If you are worried about doing to much insulin over night and cant see your endo till next week my suggestion (as tedious as it sounds) is to set alarms for yourself.... before you go to bed test your blood sugar if you find it is under say 5 or 6 i would have a glass of milk.... than set an alarm for 2-3 hours later to wake yourself up and check it than and do this through-out hate night.... i know this is a pain but after i had a seizure i did this for a few weeks till i was confident my blood sugar levels were under control and i was able to get help from my endo..

Eat more protein foods (fish, chicken, nuts, beans) for metabolism and muscle health.  Eat more vegetables for fibre to fight fat tissue.  Stay away from sugar foods and sugar drinks.

There is nothing wrong with you, you just have the wrong foods in front of you. So what are you going to do about it!!!  Protein foods and vegetables are better for you, contain less fat and sugars that create fat, and you can eat a lot more of them.|`|CBCEyns1aa	well if you know you actually have fat on you(belly check) then go ahead and starve yourself...<br>  <br>  in my opinion the best way for me to maintain wait it to take in loose calories<br>  aka: drink sodas all day long...<br>  <br>  i know i shouldnt really say this but...if you know you have fat just go ahead and starve yourself...<br>  its the #1 unquestionable best way for anyone to lose weight...<br>  eventually you'll get use to it and won't even have the problem again afterwards...youll still be hungry but you won't realise it|`|W0hNoMSsaa	What would help you lose weight is to eat more lean protein (skinless chicken breasts, turkey, lean beef, egg substitutes, beans, water-packed tuna) and less starchy, sugary food. Salad is good, but use a vinaigrette rather than a creamy dressing. Fresh fruits and vegetables will help fill you up without adding a lot of calories and fat.  Avoid potatoes, rice and other starchy side-dishes.<br>  <br>  Eating one meal a day loaded with starch can make you feel sick. You are overloading your body with too much food at once, which causes the blood sugar to spike and then plunge.  Low blood sugar is what makes you feel hungry. If your blood sugar goes too low, though, you can actually start feeling shaky and weak.  Try having three small meals a day instead to keep your blood sugar at a more constant level.  If you go for hours without eating, you will get too hungry and overeat.<br>  <br>  It's good that you  eat cereal, but make sure it is a high-fiber, low-sugar type like Cheerios or oatmeal. Most commercial cereals are loaded with added sugar and some even have added fat. Read food labels carefully. Did you know that the first ingredient in Honey Bunches of Oats is not oats, but corn?  <br>  <br>  Try to limit your consumption of products like cookies that are made with refined flour, sugar and fat and have little or no nutrition.  Fast foods and processed foods also tend to be high in sugar, salt, fat and calories and short on nutrition. <br>  <br>  Avoid full-fat dairy products like whole milk, butter and ice cream. Nonfat yogurt can be a good choice so long as it is not high in sugar. You also get more calcium that way.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water. It will help make you feel full. Try for at least five or six glasses a day. Drinking a glass of water before a meal is a trick that will help you will tend to eat less. Diet sodas always have made me feel more hungry, but your experience may be different.<br>  <br>  If you are sedentary, add some moderate exercise to your routine. Thirty minutes a day of brisk walking will help rev up your metabolism so you'll burn calories faster.|`|vFvI16P7aa	It could be that you are choosing the wrong kinds of foods for you.  Cookies, cereal, garlic bread, spaghetti?  I am on the weight watchers plan and I find that some foods make me more hungry than others.  When I eat salad, I feel better if there is a little protein in it, like chicken or cheese.  I don't eat a lot of bread or pasta, because it just turns into sugar, and I am usually hungry again quickly.  I like oatmeal for breakfast, that really fills me up, and I like popcorn with a little seasoning for a snack.  Peanut butter on celery or apples is great too.  As far as that previous poster about Acai Berry?  Watch out for that.  Did that, they tried to screw me over with the "free trial".  They start the 14 day free trial the minute you order it, although you don't even have the product.   And then, before you know it, your credit card is being charged almost $80 and they want to argue with you about it.  Don't do it, unless you want to drop $80.

Low blood sugar is another and parkinson's disease, although I would expect there would be other symptoms with both of these. I would have a general check up with your doctor and mention your concerns regarding this. Also think about whether your parents/grandparents/siblings have ever been affected like this. There is something called an 'essential tremor' I'm not sure what it is exactly but I understand that many people have it for no medical reason - it just seems to be the way they are made.<br>  Please go and have it checked with your doctor - they really are the only ones that can give you advice on this. I hope you get to the bottom of it soon. Good luck and (((hugs))) to you.

If you want to get rid of acne once and for all you should consider changing your diet.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	Follow these rules and I think you should see results in a few days or a few weeks. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE at all. DON'T EVER SQUEEZE POP or SCRATCH YOUR ZITS. Do not rub or scrub your face with anything, including a wash cloth. No scrubbing cleansers like proactive or anything gritty or abrasive, like apricot wash. Buy Oxywash maximum strength, with 10% benzoyl peroxide. wash your face no more than twice a day. DO NOT SCRUB ! Just put it on and wash it off, like any liquid soap. You don't have to leave it on and don't expect your face to burn or hurt, for it to work. That's it! it works. Now, stop touching your face and stop scrubbing and stop squeezing your zits. Put it on, wash it off, done! It works better than all that other crap. start with once a day, see how that works, got to twice a day if you feel like you have to.|`|xK75gTz9aa	drink water<br>  and use tooth paste|`|hI4m3Pnqaa	Proactive works really well.

Get the cheapest form of benzoyl peroxide, which can most likely be ordered by any retail pharmacy.  Benzoyl peroxide is white, but can be absorbed into your skin and become transparent.  The trick is to apply frequently (2-4 times per day), and let the (cream or gel) be applied to your skin, do not wash it off with water 3 seconds after you put it on (like some commercials show people doing in the shower).  MANY acne products contain benzoyl peroxide, so don't be fooled by brand names.  Also, sunlight exposure is effective.

Nothing really worked for me until i tried Murad.  I noticed changes in just 4 weeks.  I also have oily skin but i just use those oil sheets for Clean & Clear they seem to help.  I was kinda skeptical about buying acne products too, it seemed like nothing ever worked for me.  I sound like i'm trying to sell the product but it really worked for me.  It made my face clearer, I barely have any break outs and that's only when i'm not consistent to the treatment, and mostly no dry skin!  my skin actually looks healthy and i never thought my skin would ever be acne free.  All the products i used from them seemed to work.  hope you give it a try
Hx2a3xGoaa	well, definitely make them gender friendly. i had a similar case at my school. one of my teammates got into a serious car accident so we made "stay strong ____" bracelets in red and blue (she really liked spider man). perhaps you could do something similar by referencing something that everyone knows your friend likes. use a catchy saying about helping this person and make the shirts a color he likes or the color that represents the type of cancer he has (breast cancer isn't the only one with a signature color). once you have them made (you can use a website to design them for you and have someone donate the money to have them made), sell them at sporting events, local hotspots, in school, and any where else a lot of people would see them. we put an add on the radio about it and then sold the bracelets at the big game.

Walking is a good easy exercise, 30  minutes a day or more.  Carry a back pack with books for weight to burn calories.  Push ups and situps during add breaks on TV - 3 sets of 10 break in-between.  Build up to and more.  Muscle only grow in size if they have to lift more weight!  Get a small block that you can stand on, do steps one leg at a time up down, up down 25 reps.  With a chair, one leg at a time - leg on chair seat, leg down, (don't stand on chair, just raise leg) now other leg, 25 reps.  Leg raises, on your back, arms to side, raise both legs 25 reps.

Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.

XDzxqVkSaa	Your method of weight loss sounds pretty healthy.  Eating less and cutting out junk food will help you lose weight and properly nourish your body.  I'm sure your cardiovascular system and your heart is better off eating heathy food.  Believe it or not, eating junk food even if you stay skinny is not good for your body.  Just be sure you are neither starving yourself or stuffing yourself, and eat foods that have nutrients from the food groups.  Tofu is an acceptable way to replace meat.  Tofu is a good source of protein.<br>  <br>  In your case, your diet is pretty independent of your growth.  Only if you are not getting enough nutrients (unlikely), would you be hurting your height by eating a different diet.  You may actually be benefiting your chances of growing taller by eating healthy.<br>  <br>  The main factors of growth for teens are caused by hormones, genetics, and partially by exercise.  The DNA that your parents gave you will map out how tall you will grow, and when you will grow.  Your DNA will tell your body when to release naturally occurring hormones to make you taller.  Regular exercise has been shown to have a small effect on your growth rate.  likely, a regular exerciser will grow taller than a couch potato with the same genes.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there is little you can do to make yourself taller.  Your height comes down mostly to chance.  Likely, you will grow until you are in your early twenties.  Because genes are passed down from parents and grandparents, you will likely reach a height within a few inches of your father.  There is a very small chance that you will be over a foot taller than your father or shorter.  Just hang in there, be healthy, and hope for the best.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	Okay this is very long but I highly doubt that that is what caused your friends to get taller. It's good that you have these healthy eating habits, b/c we will be less likely to see you in the hospital as the result of a stroke.|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Honey,<br>  <br>  This is YOUR life.  I understand the focus on family in the Asian community, I have close Asian friends -- but this is YOUR life.  Your parents are not living in your body.  They don't feel what you feel or experience what you experience.<br>  <br>  Your eating habits are not over-the-top.  Are they healthier than mine?  Yes.  Are they healthier than a lot of my friends?  No.<br>  <br>  Your parents are fortunate to have a child who cares about his health and appearance.  It is unfortunate that they are trying to force you to eat more fat.  It will NOT make you taller.  GENETICS COMBINED with nutrition determines your height.   5'8" is a good height, and it is worth remembering that for every inch over 5'6" you will lose, on average, one year of healthy life (our hearts have not caught up with what the combination of evolution and nutrition gives us in body size).<br>  <br>  You are fine, you have not stunted your growth, you are wonderful just as you are.  Congratulations on having the courage to stand up to this so far.  I hope you continue to have the strength -- for your own sake now and in the future.<br>  <br>  Kindest thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|bP5zyipXaa	what you eat has nothing to do with growing taller it has to do with your genetic make up you could get lucky and have a growth spurt in the next couple of years or months|`|jdZfzZUjaa	Meat is an important source of iron, which is vital for making red blood cells.<br>  Eating meat also aids the absorption of iron from vegetables and<br>  cereals. One of the benefits of eating meat is that when you eat a<br>  proper balanced diet it can help iron absorb into the body. A lot of<br>  things have iron in them but you need to get it out and into the<br>  body.<br>  <br>  But to answer your other quesion (the one about slowing your growth) changing you diet had nothing to do with it.<br>  Oh, _& about your parents, I wouldn`t worry about them because if you say they are short then genetically you would be short. But since your not (your actually TALL) then your body has probably reached it`s limit -&- you will stay 5'8"|`|meK1OKVvaa	it's not fatty foods that make you grow taller... it's hormones. People grow super fast when they're babies, then hit another fast growth spurt once they reach puberty. Then they grow taller slower until their twenties when their height stops going. When you stop growing taller, you start growing wider... I don't think there's anything wrong with your eating, it's just your metabolism. Everyone's metabolism is different. The reason why you were wider than taller was because you had much more energy intake... faster than your body grew taller... and your body stored that extra energy as fat. You could eat like your friends if you want, but you'd have to burn all the extra energy down so your body won't store it. There's nothing wrong with healthy foods as well. It's good that you're taking an interest in this while you're still young because it's much harder to change and fix things when your older (high cholesterol/blood pressure/diabetes/etc).<br>  <br>  I'm asian too, and was really fat when I was a baby. When I hit puberty though, I was able to keep eating whatever I wanted, but my parents kept bugging me because they thought I was "too thin."I think it's like an old-school idea or instinct thing because if you're big, it's like you're sort of well-off because in a way it implies that you have a lot of resources available to you... which in the really old days, having an excess of resources was better than nothing and starving.|`|xEoPHpnSaa	The way I see it you should feel great about your decision. It's great that you are eating so healthy at only 15. I feel the same way about eating healthy and I'm only 14. Unlike your parents my parents support the idea of and eating healthier. I doubt that you are ruining your growth. In fact I think your are helping it. Good luck.
170GrvE0aa	If you have your prescription then it is really easy. I bought most of my glasses online at optical4less.com so I'll tell you how it worked out there. First you choose your glasses, and then press purchase. It'll prompt you to enter your personal information and then your prescription. Easy as that. But those rayban glasses look awfully expensive.

QxIhMHwAaa	As long as you don't have a problem touching your eye, contacts are really easy and don't hurt. You can go to your optometrist and ask for a sample...they usually have 5 day sample boxes available. The opticians will also teach you how to put them in, take them out, and care for them.|`|bmhnXEsVaa	I just got my first trial pair today & am still wearing them for the first 4 hours (trial to help eyes adjust to them). Tomorrow I wear them for 5 hours, the next day 6 hours, etc until I return for a follow up exam next week. My eyes watered a little when I first put them in. Big deal. My eyes feel dry & slightly irritated but tomorrow I'll go buy rewetting solution.

I would advise having a consultation with your optician, who can give you all the information you need and perhaps give you a few pairs to trial...If you bring your mum with you to the consultation, she will be able to hear all the info from the optician and she may change her decision if she knows all the info, also you could bargain with her to let you do a trial and see how it goes, and if it works out then maybe she could reconsider. <br>  I'm no expert but this is my opinion x|`|ohuabOdQaa	I've been wearing contacts for over 20 years.  They don't hurt.  It takes a couple of days to get used to them. You need to care for them, but that's really just washing your hands before handling them.  Swimming, you need to be really careful with goggles.  You can't open your eyes underwater with contacts.  But you could consider prescription goggles too. <br>  <br>  You could ask your mom to try on your glasses and tell her that's what you see like without glasses.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	I had cosmetic lenses for a while - they were the ones you could wear for like a month then throw away. <br>  <br>  The doc helped me put them in a couple times at his office, it isnt hard if you dont have a problem touching your eye and they are not uncomfortable if you keep them clean.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	prove to her that you are responsible to get contacts.You can't feel the contacts when you have them on.The first time you put and take them off, you may have some problems but you'll be fine !

mAZi1eH7aa	It doesn't really matter at all. If I find her attractive and she has a pleasing personality then the skin shade is not that important. But, if she looks great and has a bad personality or is self centered or abrasive, she is not worth being around, no matter how good she looks.<br>  I like tall slim ladies. That would be my favourite. But if a short lady with great looks goes by I will look too. It does not matter so much about skin shade or height and the like. It is a multitude of things that create attraction.

3TVGd55haa	I had invisalign and it worked wonders! I had plenty of gaps in my teeth (especially in the front). Some were behind others and very crooked in some places. It took a few months to really notice the change, but after about a year..they were beautiful! It is definately worth it. Some people wear braces anywhere between 1-4 years. It just depends on how severe your teeth are. Mine were HORRIBLE and now I love to smile! I had mine for a total of a year and a half. I probably didnt need it that long but I just wanted to be sure. <br>  I had a friend with the same issue and she had hers for about a year and hers look great. <br>  So it really depends on whether you want metal in your mouth or plastic that doesnt stain your teeth and you can take them out with you want! I hope that helps.<br>  Good Luck to ya!|`|1oUU20KEaa	well.....yah it is plastic but it is hard plastic. What happens  is you go in the dentist every few weeks and get a new invisalign thingy. But ya it works great! but i prefer braces...|`|eyfgC8XBaa	Just asked a question involving Invisalign! Haha. My orthodontist said they work good (showed me pictures, showed me the product), but they don't do as good a job as braces.<br>  <br>  I'm so confused of what to get. The ugly looking braces that give you a perfect smile, or Invisalign that's attractive, take a short time to work, but doesn't work as well. <br>  <br>  I guess it does depend how bad your teeth are. Barely nothings wrong with mine, but I just want perfect teeth. :D
dkoGI9nfaa	As puberty start, which is where it appears you are, the body plays tricks on us.  In time it will come right.  Your body is just not into a full reproductive mode.

U r 13 now and still in the midst of developing more into a young man. ur testicles are starting to produce semen now, bit by bit, so it takes time to build and store sperm. Masturbating twice a day for u at such a young age will not be too good as ur sperm stored inside ur balls will quickly be depleted. So for masturbation pleasure, i would recommend that u do once a day, wait for one day for the semen to build up as for now. Do it about 3 thrice a week and leave out saturdays and sundays to do other things. Allow ur semen to build up on saturdays and sundays.  Then by monday, u can start again. heed my advice for at least six months and from there on, u can masturbate twice daily for u will be slight more matured and have slightly more semen by then. All the best! message me if u have any problems. I can try to help u. Hope that my reply will be useful to u! :)
muHctmaGaa	You are too young, six months is too short, and of course he says he loves you, you're teenagers.<br>  <br>  If you're going to do it anyway... buy condoms and lubricant. Make sure you're relaxed and completely aroused (he should finger or go down on you first). You still might not orgasm, but at least it'll relieve some of the pain. If you don't think you've already broken your hymen, keep a handtowel next to the bed.

Just because your boyfriend loves you doesn't mean it will last forever, also do you really want to lose it this early? you have your whole life ahead of you to get into that stuff. Most people who lose their virginity in high school say they regret it when they are older...its like a tattoo, once you've done it there is no turning back! Also if you and your boyfriend really love each other, then sex can wait. A relationship is stronger then sex. And if he really did love you, he could wait. Now if your worried about him breaking up with you if you won't have sex with him, then why is he with you? for the sex! Last thing is are you ready for a baby if things go wrong?<br>  <br>  I say wait until you are older and ready to handle a sexual relationship!|`|a398ea473f595655ea49d67d2d328fb1aa	I will bet he dumps you a day or two after having your virginity...

Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener.

Everything.  This will show you where you can eliminate some empty calories.<br>  <br>  Then target things like candy, ice cream, soft drinks, desserts and snack foods.  Cut those out entirely.  <br>  <br>  Increase your consumption of fruits and vegetables, decrease your consumption of fats and oils.<br>  <br>  You will lose about 1 to 2 pounds a week, but you'll do it safely and without using harmful drugs or crash or binge diets.  Actually, you may lose a bit more the first few weeks, but don't plan on it.<br>  <br>  You should start exercising more than you are.  Start with a few sit ups and push ups, and start walking a mile every day.  Try to do the mile in under 20 minutes.  After a week or two, increase the walk to 2 miles and aim to double the number of the push ups and sit ups you do every day.<br>  <br>  This is a weight loss program that will take off pounds and flab and tighten up the underlying muscles.  You'll not only look better, you'll feel better and you'll be healthier.<br>  <br>  Stay away from fad diets and weight loss products, they don't work and may be dangerous.  Most of them rely on diuretics (substances that drive the water from your body) or an unbalanced diet to achieve their temporary weight loss.  The program here will help you lose weight and, if you keep at the program, keep it off.

If you don't exercise hard enough, it'll just be a waste of your time. <br>  I'm sure you can find workout videos or borrow some from the library.<br>  Or you can go to a gym or just buy your own weights at a thrift store or something.<br>  Good luck :)|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	im the same way im 14 years old and 160 pounds and i loveee food but you can quit soda that helps alot and try to eat a yummy salad but most important thing exercise run around in the house a little but i know how hard it is trust me|`|CFfNpnDEaa	start swimming on a swim team. you loss a lot of Weight when you swim. you also get stronger and might attract some cute boys.........

You should use sunblock and lipbalm as your skin is going to be very dry when you are on this drug. It has also been linked to skin-thinning, this could increase your risk of skin cancer if you should burn in the sun. It's better to be pale and interesting (and acne-free!) than red raw anyway, give the sun a miss this weekend. Or come to England, no chance of sunburn here, sadly!

bd47e61283bb33e7cdd3ee21ddb0b633aa	What you are describing happened to me.  At the time I knew it was trouble looming and I wanted to get somewhere and take some sun, heat and mother nature.  I let everyone talk me out of it.  They didn't seem to understand where I knew I was headed (full blown depressive episode) since I am usually very happy, motivated, a do-gooder.  I only wish I had taken my own advice and got out of town for a few days to let mother nature work wonders for now I find myself in an incapacitating depression, wandering between trying to sleep, looking on computer out of sheer desperation for relief.  I suggest you take action to do what might be fun for you before all is lost and little to nothing would be fun for you.  That state is a particular form of hell I'd take strong action to avoid.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Someone stole your identity and left you with skin and bones.  You will need to start over.  Just joking.  No person can be happy all the time and it is quite normal to be depressed sometimes. Keep a journal of when it starts and how long it last.  You may need it.|`|XbpJO3jHaa	go for a 30min run before you go to bed
jlHz0Fg1aa	Exercise, absolutely. You also need to have social interaction outside your house daily.|`|GXVanwgPaa	hold ur face up into the sun, look around u, run outside and sieze the day!|`|a5MzSF5qaa	Exercise. It releases  feel good hormones (endorphins) into your blood stream and gets rid of tension. Go for a run. Start running slowly and every now and then do a sprint at max pace for as long a distance as you can handle. You're feeling trapped? Think of this as running toward an open door and just go for it. It helps a lot of people, you will not be the first. <br>  Hope it helps. Stay safe.|`|AA10387019	Motivation follows action. So if you want to get motivation, action first. Don't wait until motivation comes.You will probably keep waiting for ever.<br>  So in a nutshell, action. Do a small thing first.<br>  <br>  Don't overwhelm yourself. Don't distract yourself. You need to correct your inner distorted thoughts.
S3AU0KDiaa	Plenty of time. <br>   Just eat healthy and do cardio exercise like cycling, brisk walking, running or swimming.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Wow, it's been about that much time since i started my diet & exercise.  I'm a 19 y/o male, 187lbs... & in that time i've lost 20 lbs, many additional inches around my waist and build up my upper body.  It's beastly now.|`|tIldpr7vaa	couldnt hurt, but diet is the key to losing weight
b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	o yes i had discharge fo 2 and a half years!<br>  my story:<br>  <br>  <br>  ok i was 13 and i was at this construction site with my school and we were planting flowers for dranige to help the local waters.i was eating my lunch and drank a whole arizona tea and had to pee soo bad so i went to the bathroom.now keep in mind it wa at a construction site in the middle of nowhere and my purse was back at school in my locker with a tampon in it for when i did start i pulled my pants down went and then looked down and there was a redspot in my pants.so i used toilet paper and there were only 3 sheets left so i had to take my sock of and use that too!!! as soon as i got back to school i got back to school i changed into a tampon.i had no idea i was going to get it had no cramps or nothing and to tis day i dont!!i hope i amused you!!|`|u7o75zipaa	Well, I had no idea mine was coming until I was at the toilet and saw a kinda reddish brown in my pants lol.<br>  At first I was like wtf.. and then I was like ahh my period.<br>  I was at home btw, so it was quite lucky.<br>  It doesn't come out like a lot at first, so it's okay :) x|`|6gthdHpnaa	I had discharge for about two years, starting when I was 10. I was 12, and it was two weeks before I turned 13, I had a stomachache the day before it came, and I went to bed, and woke up and laid in my bed with an awful stomachache. Finally I got up, and it was really scary at first because I had just woken up and was all groggy and the bottom part of my underwear was like, soaked in blood. Then, I went to school, my stomach hurt horribly the whole time and after school I went and bought some Midol and Always Maxi Pads with Flexi-Wings (they make it sound so fun, with all those cute names and bright colors, but really it's not.)|`|MARjA459aa	Well you never know for sure when it is coming, i didn't start mine until 9th grade the first day back after christmas break. it was horrible because i wasn't totally prepared. I was however expecting it soon enough because i was around the age. The thing is, is that you always are going to want to be prepared. If you think you are around the age of getting you period (usually 2 years after breast growth has started) think maybe you should carry pads around with you in your purse.<br>  <br>  Expect the Unexpected!|`|uV2ql06Oaa	haha it was a weeeirrddd day. it was memorial day and it was extremely cloudy outside, so I was inside the house sitting on the floor in front of the tv building a cabinet/shelf for my bathroom (?? that's totally not me! haha) and then I decided I had to go potty which was when I discovered the big surprise.. it was suuuuuch an odd day.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	I was at work with my mom i think I was 12. I just got this really funny feeling and told my mom i needed to go to the bathroom, I went to the restroom and there was blood on my underwear, that was it. I didnt have any "discharge" or anything|`|91efda28821aef91bfa14ff72083fd43aa	Well speaking from almost twelve years of period experience here I could tell some stories...but here's my first period story<br>  <br>  I was eleven years old, and it was my first day at comprehensive school ((I'm british by the way)), and terribly na?ve for that age.<br>  <br>  I think I was in history class in a crappy old demountable building, with, and I'm not kidding here...it had wooden desks ((yes in 1997 my school was crap.))<br>  <br>  Anyways I just remember having a hot flush sensation and not to be too graphic here, but a wet feeling in my pants and when I got to the bathroom to check myself there was an almost jelly like red-brown discharge there.<br>  <br>  Now I'm sure women all over the world will agree with me here when I say that, you know your period is coming, but you always feel the cramps and pain so much more once you actually know you've gotten your period.<br>  <br>  Now in answer to your non discharge thing, I dint have any either, I had no warning I was getting my first period at all. <br>  <br>  So as one of the other answers said, expect the unexpected, be prepared, and know who you can talk to if you're worried about anything. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|qTqjlHDtaa	well umm a sign your going to get your period is discharge. its the way the vagina cleans itself for preparation for your period. i don't have mine yet but im closee.
BRDqfAy3aa	It is possible depending on type of hymen - read below about hymen and tampon insertion|`|u7o75zipaa	Yeah.. and just through everyday life really. Like if you play sports, there's a chance it could already be broken. <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about it :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ignore those comments, it CAN be broken through tampon use.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Maybe a little bit, but definitely not to the extent that a penis will.|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	yes it can darling. it can tear through sports, sex, inserting a tampon, or just naturally|`|uUGSLs9Daa	yes it can, if can even if you do gymnstics,horse riding ect ect. or just natrually. x|`|2r7vLzvXaa	i think it can|`|kTBE4dYEaa	no it can't, you don't push a tampon in with enough force.<br>  but nowadays most women break their hymen before having sex. in the olden days women just sat around or took easy walks but today activities like horse riding, gymnastics, running and other things mean that women usually break their hymen before actually having sex. or if they don't break it they stretch it so there's less blood in it which means when you have sex you wont bleed, or it wont be very much if you do.|`|XsNqpRWwaa	yes, in fact, the whole story that when you lose your virginity and your vaginal area will bleed a little due to the hymen ripping, sometimes girls dont bleed because it is highly possible that a tampon could have done the job before the guy did! lol|`|yJ31VS79aa	Yeah. It can tear if you use tampons. Also if you do certain sports, like gymnastics it can tear. But don't worry. It isn't a big deal. Your first time will be just as good. Even better really less pain =]|`|c7d8c481e6f31523121ba3235e8e5c6daa	Ive heard people say that it can but my health teacher said No it cant.<br>  Hope it Helps :)|`|L4PZfkisaa	yes it can be broken by a tampon|`|WcurY9Mtaa	no
lQZ95AgWaa	People call all kinds of names.  They shouldn't concern you.  Only a doctor can tell if you are disturbed, and can help.  Believe in yourself and if you are really concerned, talk to a doctor about it.  Don't worry about people who call names - they are not worth your time as they are mean spirited and love to hurt people's feelings.  Be strong, believe in yourself, and talk to people who love you, like your parents or siblings.  <br>  I will pray for you.|`|a5MzSF5qaa	What do you do to make them think that? I get called crazy all the time because of the way I do things. I accept it as a compliment. In my world, to stand out is difficult, so I see it as a way to distinguish myself from the pack of sheep.|`|N4kqaOe7aa	There only haveing a lauph with u lol|`|GXVanwgPaa	don't get paranoid or u will make it harder to prove them wrong. people have called me emo, crazy, phycatic, and some have said i need serious mental help so i know how that feels when people question ur sanity. stay mentally strong and stand ur ground.don't let them in ur head. and u'll be fine|`|sy4HR96eaa	preppyn'pretty..I don't think so..<br>  <br>  your crazy remember?
GvQHw4Ntaa	Yeah, those are a symptom of cystic breast disease... the cysts aren't harmful at all, but they can cause a lot of pain, especially leading up to menstruation. They do get firmer as your period approaches, and can actually get larger during that time as well. Evening primrose oil is supposed to be extremely helpful in reducing symptoms.
VHuENOonaa	Yea it's normal. With any surgery you will be swollen for up to 4 weeks. You should already have an appointment with your doctor as a follow up. Ask them if anything can be done to help reduce the swelling
G2ehZV6iaa	You can lose weight at any age,just follow the steps below <br>  <br>  * Eliminate refined carbohydrates from your diet.<br>  * Rotate your food such that you do not eat the same food often because your body could get used to a certain food routine. (Calorie shifting). This has the effect of raising your metabolism and, therefore, facilitating speedy weight loss.<br>      * Stay away from fast food.<br>      * Drink water instead of soda, lots of water.<br>      * Stay away from fried food.<br>      * Engage in brisk walking (cardio) exercise and weight training. <br>  <br>  Try a few weight loss products too.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	By watching portion sizes, eating lots of fruits and vegetables and drinking a lot of water.  Getting plenty of exercise.<br>  <br>  Also, if you can do it consult with a personal trainer because they have additional knowledge on kinds of exercises that can be of help with trying to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what additional suggestions they might have.
AA10450066	Congratulations for trying to conquer this at such a time in your life,and welcome to some of the best years too.Depending on how much weight you want to loose there really isn't anything you can't do as before.Before you start you might want to have a physical if you haven't had one in awhile.I'm sure you're aware of all the annual screenings that start at 50 in any event.As in any diet I'm sure you know the trick is to burn more calories than you take in.Of course any and all the exercise you want is an added plus not only to loose weight and tune up while doing,it'll make your menopause go allot smoother.By now we are used to certain daily routines and there the "secret" usually lies in where we eat too much.For some of us there are those times in every day when we just want something to munch on.I know my problem was that I would use food to reward myself for doing something well.This time in your life it's going to be hard as your hormones are going to really "rule"your life for awhile.If possible see if you can find someone to join you.There's always help in numbers(lol) and comfort too.If your married let your hubby know he'll have to give more right now but it'll be well worth it.You're not only going to feel better but be healthier too.Good luck and God bless.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Join a slimming club, my wife enjoys slimming world with it's red and green days, and it as become a sociable event every week, she has lost her weight but still attends most weeks to meet up with other people, try it and see what you think, my wife was forced through the menopause with the hot flushes and all the discomforts but as reverted since stopping the medication from a cancer cure, it was extreme but she now enjoys her slimming world meeting. good luck|`|I54KyS8Laa	Any exercise you do is great but not necessary, but great for many other reasons than simply dropping weight. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the educational system doesn’t teach us much about stress and how to deal with the resultant emotions which cause us to eat. <br>  <br>  If you get the connection between emotional eating and stress you can literally forget about food and that means any sweets or binging that might have stood in your way.

i9W9rKSXaa	Well I will say that is the longest I have seen those kind of effects last but then again I don't know many people who weigh 94 punds who took morphine. Pretty much time is the best bet but a few things you can do are eating Garlic and other anti-oxidents...some people say milk helps too. But the most important thing you can do is not to worry because at this point if anything really bad was going to happen it would have already. This will pass...hang in there!!!!|`|IMvg8zajaa	You came close to an overdose, that's not the normal effects, you took way to much, if you didn't take so much, these effects wouldn't happen. Best idea i can think of is take something that will helps you pee, and something that will help you take a crap. Also, Ibuprofen.|`|exMPHWKHaa	Like all the rest are saying yeah it was obviously a bad move. 94 pounds is incredibly low. If you took a much smaller dose you would have felt nice effects and it would be much much more pleasant. Just learn from this bad experience as you need to find the correct dose or start out small and work your way up so you don't overdose and have horrible effects. These effects shouldn't last much longer if you want you could go to the hospital and im sure they could get it out of your system. They might last a day or two at most. Just take it easy and drink a lot of water if you don't want to go to the hospital. Good luck.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	Those are common effects of opiates. Your bodies not used to it, and you should not continue because you can't handle it. Especially 100mg for some one who weighs only 94lbs thats definetly too much for you to handle.... I felt like i was going to puke my second time taking oxycodones and thats no where nearly as bad as morphine.  and let me tell you, i'll never touch opiates again.<br>  <br>  Dont play around with morphine, its strong sh*t and very addictive, nothing to play around with. Its like heroin.<br>  <br>  It will eventually flush itself out of your system.  Drink lots of water and eat healthy for the next few days.
xUhh33upaa	I am been using it for 4 months, feel better and stronger. My mother started using it 2 months ago, she said she like it.  Isotonix is a good way. I stopped going to GNC where you could find cheapper things but my health is not cheap.  I need a good and reliable source.<br>  <br>  First 7-10 days, you should take it 2 cap size per day, then you can take 1 per day according your weight.  To maximum the result, you can take much more than the label indication, such as 2 in the am, and 2 in pm.  <br>  <br>  Short after you start taking it, you may feel uncomfortable all over your body, these are normal, keep taking it, you will feel wonderful.<br>  <br>  If you need more information, you can visit this web: www.marketamerica.com/front, or email me, I will try to help you more.<br>  <br>  Sunny
XUCER5Vcaa	Underside of your chin is not tmj and it is not where your molars are located.  Your molars are at the rear of your mouth.  TMJ is has to do with the area where the upper and lower jaw connect.  I would suggest go to your dentist and mention the areas where you are having pain.  They will take an xray- either a panoramic or a PA.  <br>  If you are having pain where your molars are  have you had your wisdom teeth removed?  If not it could be related to this.  I could be inflamation of the gums or the nerve.  If further diagnosis is needed have your dentist refer you to an oral surgeon if it is involving your molar and root canal or any indication of nerve related issues.  A Periodontist handles the gums!!!!|`|xjZNnFLtaa	Tension.  We cannot stop that jaw tension if we have stress in ours lives, and all sorts of probs crop up, right through to migraine headaches.  Get good advice and start to clear up your problems.     Not easy, I know!  I can pick up someone else's tension just by sitting with them.|`|pjYQhPPBaa	Sounds like TMJ. I have the exact same problem. Does your jaw lock or pop? That had been happening to me for years, until recently when it really started hurting, almost like it's bruised. I spoke with my dentist about it (though I haven't seen him because I'm at college) and he said it sounds exactly like TMJ.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is talk to your dentist about it, since it's been recurring for the past few years. However, he'll most likely tell you it's from grinding your teeth (which you might unknowingly do in your sleep) and that you need to wear a night guard for a while to fix it.

It smells really nice and if you forget to use it one day you don't break out like crazy.  Its also more personalized than Proactiv.
dG4HU7LHaa	I think your friend needs to get out of this little mind set she has.  She's complaining about her weight, correct?  Does she think she's fat even though she's at a healthy weight?  She needs to eat and you and her friends need to be there to support her.  Tell her parents, they've probably noticed this habit and are also probably concerned about their daughter.  If there's more people supporting her, maybe she'll actually acknowledge that hey, maybe I have an eating disorder that needs to be addressed.<br>  <br>  You need to egg her on.  Make food she enjoys so that she'll eat.  I would suggest eating meat because she's a vegetarian (because we need meat in our diets) but I'm not sure how she'd take it.  Make sure she drinks water and call her parents.  That's the main thing you have to do, call them and make sure they know whats going on with their daughter and always stick by your friends side so that she'll have support.  Support is the biggest thing for her right now, it'll help her get through it.<br>  <br>  Hope it'll be resolved soon. :)|`|wpqJr2FMaa	Yeah.<br>  You need to just tell her that she doesn't eat enough.<br>  AND TO START M-O-T-H-E-R-F-U-C-K-I-N-G EATING!|`|4oFpT7m3aa	tell her that not eating will make her gain weight and it ruins your hair gives you wrinkles and it will make her crazy<br>  tell her to eat healthy fruits veggies whole wheat breads plenty of water if she wants to get thinner tell her to exercise
jdZfzZUjaa	Penis size growth typically doesn't start until around 11-16 years of age (average: 13-14). Normal penis size covers a wide range, and the average size is probably smaller than you think: about 3 to 4 inches (about 9 cm) in a non-erect, mature male. As there are boys with penises larger (perhaps twice that size), there are also boys who have smaller, and still normal, sized penises. When you're an adult, you'll learn that size doesn't matter so much, but it still can be very frustrating! Try not to worry about it if you think you're "too small" -- appreciate what you have!

LgoBsjFXaa	I have self mutilated (ie. burned myself) at times when I have been angry or disappointed with myself.  I guess that would be anger turned inward.<br>  <br>  I have also deliberately burned myself when I have felt so isolated and void of feelings that I simply wanted to feel alive.  By feeling pain, I felt alive and less removed from the situation.<br>  <br>  Now, I try to reach out to others when I want to do this, to discover the source of my anger and work through it or to reconnect and feel like part of the world again.|`|cSBZQfaIaa	Social setting may greatly influence the onset of self-mutilation. Self-mutilation has been known to occur as an epidemic. For example, hundreds of cases of self-inflicted eye injuries have been reported among soldiers wishing to avoid duty. Furthermore, another study suggests the spread of self-mutilative behavior on the wards of psychiatric units. Self-mutilation has also been reported as a coping mechanism for inmates in repressive settings. In a Canadian correctional institution for adolescent girls, 86 percent of the inmates carved their skin. These individuals reported feeling a sense of satisfaction and control when performing self-mutilation. Although a number of psychological theories attempt to explain self-mutilation, it is often best thought of as a purposeful act of self-help. Some theorists suggest that self-mutilation is an attempt to differentiate between ego boundaries. Other theorists see self-mutilation as rage against the self. Self-mutilation has also been described as a mechanism to deal with sexual conflict.

BILIAKSOaa	Relax before you go to bed. Try not to drink pop like within four hours of you going to bed. Make sure the room is dark and you are comfortable. Close your eyes even if you don't want to. Try to clear your mind and not think about things. Eventually you will fall asleep. Don't worry, it happens to me a lot to. I always think about things when I'm in my bed so I can never fall asleep. Good luck.

It will establish a habit of achieving sleep at regular times. <br>  Everything in Moderation – No matter how good it might feel to lie in bed for as long as possible, too much of a good thing is not good. Long periods spent in bed can lead to shallow and fragmented sleep.<br>  Get the Lead Out – Research shows that regular daily exercise promotes deeper more restorative sleep. Even light exercise such as a daily walk is very beneficial, just make sure not to exercise right before bedtime. It takes time to wind down from activity.<br>  Keep Your Cool – When the heat rises over 75 degrees it can lead to less REM sleep and more periods of waking. Cold rooms are no better, The ideal temperate for restful sleep is between 68 and 72 degrees.<br>  Let Them Eat Cake – Research shows that a light snack before turning in for the night tends to aid sleep. Be aware that heavy meals though will interfere with restful sleep.<br>  What the Doctor Ordered – On occasion, a sleep aid, whether over-the-counter or prescribed may be helpful, but be aware that regular use of sleep aids may promote dependency and actually increase problems. Use them only as a last resort.<br>  No Java Jive, No Butts About It – Cut out caffeine in the evening. Plain and simple, it disturbs sleep. Caffeine can be found in coffee, tea, colas, chocolate and many other sources so be aware. Tobacco use also disturbs sleep. If you are a smoker, consider hypnosis to free yourself of that old habit, but until you do, stay away from tobacco in the evenings.<br>  One for the Road – Cut out the nightcaps. While alcohol sometimes helps people fall asleep faster, the resulting chemically induced sleep is disrupted when the effects of alcohol begin to wear off.<br>  The Sound of Silence – People who sleep through anything can also have their sleep disrupted by noise or unusual sounds. Not waking up does not mean your sleep is not disturbed. Create an atmosphere insulated from outside sound or get a white noise machine to mask sounds. Even a small fan in the room can be effective. <br>  Kiss and Make Up – Never go to bed angry. Going to bed with work or worry on your mind is the perfect way to lose sleep. Always find time to resolve your day or clear your mind before you turn out the lights for the night. This is the perfect time to practice your self-hypnosis or listen to a relaxation recording.<br>  Hope it helps you;);) and have a good night..=)|`|mT5srUKHaa	im not sure why but try this it should help u fall asleep<br>  <br>  <br>   1. Practice good "sleep hygiene". Get yourself ready for sleep by relaxing a few hours before bedtime -- take a warm bath,or write in a journal or diary. also put a few droplets of lavender oil on your pillow. Drink a glass of warm milk, with a teaspoon of honey stirred through if you'd like. Do this just before bed, but be sure to brush your teeth before bed-- the sugar in milk and honey can cause tooth decay, especially if your mouth dries out at night. Try a three-week regimen to get your body into this habit (studies show it takes approximately three weeks for your body to permanently adjust to routine). Make notes if you discover patterns of sleep or going to bed that work. For some people, sleep can be highly ritualistic...cultivate the rituals that produce your best sleep experiences. If you don't like the taste of plain warm milk, try it by making hot chocolate with warm milk instead of water. However, if you drink hot chocolate, make sure it's caffeine-free or you won't be able to sleep.<br>     2. Make sure you have a comfortable bed in which you can get a good night's sleep. Buy a decent mattress. A mattress is worth more than you think, considering you use it every night, so don't hold back! If you're too hot or cold, add or remove blankets until comfortable. Adjust the temperature so it is cooler than usual, but not too cold. Make sure to stock up on blankets, if you do this. If you have time, consider cleaning your room before trying to get to bed. Having a clean room can be calming when trying to fall asleep. A messy room will distract most people, and it can make you feel uncomfortable.<br>     3. Soundproof your room. Soundproofing your room will not only help you fall asleep, it will help you stay asleep. If you cannot block off external sounds, look into getting a white noise machine. These are relatively cheap and produce a neutral sound that can drone out other noises and still let you go to sleep.[1]<br>     4. Read. Reading will help the mind focus on only one thing, instead of racing about the day's activities. Read something calming rather than an exciting thriller novel. Fairy tales or nonfiction would be good choices.<br>     5. Adjust the lights to a level you are comfortable with. For optimal results, a pitch black room with no lights helps you sleep better through the night. If you have an alarm clock that is lighting up half the room as you try to sleep, turn it around or cover it with a towel. Most cell phones have an alarm on them, so you can use that instead of a bright, bulky alarm clock. If you must have mild illumination in your bedroom (e.g. glowing face of digital clock, night light), remember that red wavelengths of light generally are not as disruptive to sleep cycles as blue or green wavelengths. If you need to sleep during the day, use eye covers.<br>     6. Get into a comfortable position, loosen any tight restrictive clothing. Position yourself comfortably on your back in bed, with your arms by your side. If you are uncomfortable with any way your body feels on the bed, correct it immediately, e.g., your body's weight on your arm is too strong, or your hip feels awkward--change position quickly until you're completely comfortable. Optimally, sleep nude. This might bother some people or make them feel uncomfortable, in which case, wear comfortable clothes like pajamas or a nightgown rather than tight or constricting "day clothes."<br>     7. Practice deep breathing. If you're having trouble trying to sleep, try a deep breathing exercise. For example, lie on your back in bed and breathe in deeply for four counts, watching your stomach rise, and then breathe out for four counts. Your goal is to breath in and out about six times per minute. Do this for about ten minutes (60 breaths) and then switch so you're lying on your right, and repeat the breathing process. Another way to go about doing it is this:<br>  <br>            * Take a deep breath using one nostril closed,<br>            * Now exhale with the nostril that is closed, during this exhalation, close the other.<br>            * Repeat these steps using the other nostril. Do this 60 times (at least 10 minutes) and you will feel very dizzy/relaxed.<br>     8. Imagine yourself sinking into the mattress, Starting from the very tips of your toes. When you loosen all your muscles, it gives the effect that you're sinking in. In your mind, begin to "acknowledge" everything around you that all your senses are experiencing. For example: Say to yourself (not out loud), "I hear the clock ticking. I smell the lotion I just applied to my hands. I feel my legs' weight on the bed. I hear my spouse/partner breathing. I see different shades of black. I hear the dog barking in the distance. I hear myself in my own mind talking.", etc. This should help to clear your mind by slowly acknowledging everything and subsequently dismissing it. Stay on your back, sunk into the mattress until you feel it is time toTips<br>  <br>      * A GREAT tip is to have a stool by your window! Then if your are bored you can just imagine yourself chasing cars and you just drift off to a Calm Sleep<br>  <br>      * If you have a quiet, cold room, it will make you fall asleep easier.<br>      * Try looking upward gently while your eyes are closed (like trying to look at your forehead with your eyes closed.) This makes your mind think that you are sleeping- making you fall asleep faster.<br>      * Try to visualize in great detail your crush. His/her smile, clothing, them talking to you, anything.<br>      * If you are constantly telling yourself you need to go to bed, you will get no where.<br>      * Spray your room/pillow/blankets with a light soothing scent. It really helps calm you.<br>      * If your mind races with thoughts, keep a notebook or journal by the bed and write them down so you can rest your mind and not worry about forgetting that thought.<br>      * If you are very active your body may be restless at night. Massage your leg and arm muscles.<br>      * Try sleeping with a pet (most of the time this will not work because pets tend to move around a lot and they may want out of your room in the middle of the night) but also can be very calming knowing that there is someone there with you.<br>      * Find something that makes a very quiet, steady sound. A small fan on low setting or a real, non-electric, ticking watch. For some the sound will induce stress and make sleep harder, but for some, the steady beat of the ticking (because a watch has many smaller ticks inside of the tick-tock-tick-tock), or the quiet hum that the electric motor in the fan makes can be very peaceful. However if you live in an extremely quiet place, don't even bother. When it is quiet enough, you can hear a very deep, close, and seemingly loud humming in your ears. It is the sound of blood moving in your ears, and while the outside world must be just about silent before you can hear it, don't hesitate to take advantage of this opportunity when you get it.<br>      * As much as you can, try to stay in bed with your eyes closed, even if you are not actually sleeping. You will drift in-and-out of sleep even if you do not realize it. As a result, you will be more relaxed in the long run.<br>      * If you find you are still wide-awake after a half-hour or so, try getting out of bed and doing something relaxing in another room. Just sitting in a comfortable chair with the lights off, or looking out the window for a few minutes, can help you relax and make it easier to fall asleep.<br>      * Relax by imagining a wave of comfort start from your feet and slowly work this "wave" up your body. The process should take about 10 minutes.<br>      * Eat a banana or two before bed. The magnesium in the banana will help your muscles to relax (Although keep in mind bananas also contain potassium which energizes the body). Other foods that will help you fall asleep are: Cheese (but this may give you vivid dreams, you do not get nightmares from eating cheese before bed), Mustard, Pickles, Lettuce, Turkey. They have natural chemicals that work with your brain to send a 'calm' message over your body.<br>      * Some people believe that eating protein-enriched foods as a snack will help slow the mind so it can focus on sleeping. So a small pack of nuts or trail mix would be helpful.<br>      * Exercise during the late afternoon. Go for a jog or to the gym. The aftereffects of the chemicals in your body released during the workout will get you through the evening. It's much easier to fall asleep if you've done something active since it's much easier to go to sleep when you're exhausted or tired than just sitting at home with all your energy from food you ate.<br>      * Sometimes, it's easier to go to sleep with some lights on if you wear a sleeping mask.<br>      * Tense all your leg muscles. Inhale slowly. Relax and exhale slowly. Repeat about seven times.<br>      * Do not watch T.V. to help you go to sleep. The lights and the noise can make you stay awake for an hour or more.<br>      * Do not exercise before going to bed. This will get your adrenaline going, your heart pumping, and speed up your respiratory system. Those things will make it very hard to fall asleep.<br>      * The most important part of your body that should be relaxed (and the one that almost everyone overlooks) is your tongue. When you notice it, you'll find that it is invariably plastered against the roof of your mouth or up against your front teeth. Make a conscious effort to relax your tongue, jaw, and face along with the rest of your body. You'll be surprised how quickly you fall asleep!<br>      * Sleep is just a lowered state of consciousness. Get to that state faster by not thinking. The easiest way to do this is to focus on the color black you "see" when you close your eyes.

K5IOSGXAaa	My daughter used it for one year following being molested as a teenager, she was very depressed and had a lot of problems ( as you well may imagine). She went to therapy and also we gave her the St. John's Wort. It worked very well for her. It took less than a week to work and we started her off by having her take it at night before bed, as it makes you sleepy ( for most people) until your body gets used to it. Then she took it twice a day, morning, and evening. When she felt better she simply told us and stopped taking it, no withdrawal etc. One of my relatives had taken it for mild depression and it worked very well too, took it for several years. You may have to adjust the dosage to see what works for you and this can take a few weeks.

Co9I2OMSaa	I am 14 and sometimes I think about having sex, and sometimes I really want too.  But, like you, I never would- it grosses me out just thinking about it sometimes.  It's good that you say that you won't, because you're definitely too young, but thinking about it and wanting it at your age is normal and the feelings you get after thinking about it are normal, every teen goes through that at some point.  And feeling dirty after thinking about it could also be another way of your body telling you you're not ready for it.|`|AXsTB96Faa	to think about having sex is normal at ur age<br>  but to have sex at ur age is not a good thing at allllllll|`|3zl6DrjVaa	not really ,do one i know does it.but if you think  your ready you should rethink to make sure . because after that you can;t go back|`|pexxZB8Daa	yesm ur fine, dont worry!|`|KBostCD4aa	i think its a natural urge, kinda young but its natural to feel like that. but remember your virginity is very special and waiting always is better|`|bgGWUnYgaa	It's normal thorugh puberty hormones rise.. or sumtin like that cuasing you to feel horny|`|XrJXITkgaa	It seems weird but its totally normal|`|qTqjlHDtaa	nah im 14 too. its totally normal. it's just your hormones:]|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	because of hormonal changes you are going thru at your age, it is normal, but it would be foolish to let your gonads rule your life, use your brain and understand that it is far too soon for you.|`|kDvKc3npaa	Totally normal, just don't act on it.<br>  <br>  If you find it too much to bare, try masturbating, its a lot safer than sex and a lot more satisfying
rTaaIXSuaa	Absolutely not!<br>  ADD ADHD are made up diseases doctors created to generate more money for the pharmaceuticals.<br>  My son was diagnosed with ADD and he was prescribed ritalin. I refused to dope up my kid just to 'fit in' with the so called normalcy standards on how kids should be.<br>  All I did was change his diet and modified certain areas in his lifestyle.<br>  He turned out to be a great kid and graduated a year before he was supposed to.

As well, I have noticed the pills help me focus my thoughts and comments.  <br>  <br>  It all sounds good, but is it?  If I am presenting the world with a false sense of what I am and what I can do, am impacting my integrity?  Am I somehow saying the real me must be better and somehow jeopardizing my own self of self esteem?|`|AA11035516	Before going on any type of medication you should try modifications to the diet. I've heard that cutting down on your sugar intake can help a lot.|`|zKHstLVfaa	they sure are, help you focus if thats what you mean by good
OUbNSXjJaa	To tackle anger problem, there are few suggestions. One is to isolate yourself. Go to a cool and calm place. Like garden, green lawn, sea beach, etc. Do not unduly exercise your mind at all for illegitimate causes. Think that you have no brain for a while. It is a kind of meditation.<br>  <br>  Second thing is, you should not get angry initially unless provoked. Control your mind. Slowly and steadily try.<br>  <br>  Third thing is, give a higher orientation or purpose for getting angry. I mean if you get angry to maintain overall discipline and orderliness, you will get support from unknown forces/sources.<br>  <br>  Fourth thing is know your position well, and do not try to get angry with elders, teachers, peers, mentors, priests, parents, etc.<br>  <br>  There is also a fifth method of directing the anger towards your own self, for not revealing the truth or reality.<br>  <br>  Sixth method is do not get angry for "selfish" reasons.<br>  <br>  You should know that we waste our energy unnecessarily by getting angry or irritated. Such energy can be usefully diverted and utilized for better achievements.|`|ParFJxnSaa	I am very sorry for your loss.

Those stages are:<br>  <br>  Denial: The initial stage: "It can't be happening." <br>  ***Anger:*** "Why ME? It's not fair?!" (either referring to God, oneself, or anybody perceived, rightly or wrongly, as "responsible") <br>  Bargaining: "Just let me live to see my son graduate." <br>  Depression: "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?" <br>  Acceptance: "It's going to be alright.<br>  Growth: Grief is a chance for personal growth. For many people, it may eventually lead to renewed energy to invest in new activities and new relationships. Some people seek meaning in their loss and get involved in causes or projects that help others. Some people find a new compassion in themselves as a result of the pain they have suffered. They may become more sensitive to others, thus enabling richer relationships. Others find new strength and independence they never knew they had. After the loss, they find new emotional resources that had not been apparent before. Kübler-Ross originally applied these stages to any form of catastrophic personal loss (job, income, freedom). This also includes the death of a loved one and divorce.<br>  <br>   Kübler-Ross also claimed these steps do not necessarily come in order, nor are they all experienced by all patients, though she stated a person will always experience at least two.See www.amazon.com/ for books on the various stages. After a while, consider making a photoalbum/scrapbook and/or a shrine, in remembrance, and set aside; say; one day every month, perhaps on a significant date, (for example; the 17th, or the second thursday) on which to reflect. Many religious organisations offer counselling, or you may feel more comfortable with a therapist, to express your thoughts, and feelings. Journalling may help in this. Celebrate that life; be thankful for the experience, and remember the good times.

You might be depressed. Have you talked to a doctor about these feelings? It really could make a difference, especially if you don't get better within the next year or so.|`|TrcMc8nVaa	Hi I sent you an email|`|3jOG5V5caa	hmmm...I used to have an anger problem as well and i would always flash out on my family for the stupidest reasons or with none at all.  I guess the first step is realizing that you have a problem, which sounds like you have.  Maybe you can try seeing a proffessional or a counselor.  Usually my anger came from issues that i kept inside and i never vented or shared my concerns so they would build up untile i would  finally flash out on people whenever they did the slightest thing to annoy me.  I don't know what your really going through but it seems like the death of your friend might be the source of where most of your anger comes from.  <br>  <br>  Try to find people who you can talk to like parents, close friends who care for you and are willing to listen.  They might not nessecarily<br>  give you an answer that will make all the anger/pain go away but I know it definitely helps when you have someone to talk to and help you through it. I don't know if your a religious person at all but what really worked for me was when i got right with God.  When i started letting Him into my life I just felt like i was beggining to heal.  I didn't really feel angry/ depressed anymore because it all seem not to matter any more.  It's kind of hard to explain unless you experienced.  All i can say is that i felt this tremendous love.  The problems didn't really go away or get better but for some reason they just didn't have that hold on me anymore.  If i could say it in words it woud be that I experienced a type of love that was so true and amazing that i just didn't care anymore and I was just so happy and fulfilled that everything else seemed to melt away.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for the book but I really hope this helps and you will find a way to get through this.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	None of us ever know how we are going to react to the pain of losing someone we care about.  Your feelings are not unusual.  You are angry about losing your friend and you don't have anyone to blame, so you blame everyone.<br>  <br>  I think you should look for a support group for people who have lost a loved one.  It takes a lot of time and energy to work through feelings as painful as this.  Having a group of people who understand what you are going through should make it easier.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0YM69bw7aa	i am so sorry about your friend, but it will soon faid away... what i mean is that when one of my friends died i did not get angry but i cried for long hours, so try may be try getting out more or throw a crazy sleep-over party with all of your friends to take it off your mind. now about the anger problems there is no better medicine for that than a couple of stress balls and a good happy book. i am sorry if this was a waste of time but i feel bad... good luck, bless your friend in heavan and bless you:)|`|6WxsrIusaa	You have described a totally normally reaction to a love one's death.  It sounds like people around you realize that what you're going through is normal, too.  That's a lucky thing.<br>  <br>  The time it takes you to process and "return to normal" is going to be unique to you and nothing you can really control--when you're done processing, you're done processing.  Just let yourself feel what you need to feel for as long as you need to feel it.  <br>  <br>  A mental health professional such as a counselor or psychiatrist should be at least be keeping tabs on you as you work through this difficult time.  At best, he/she could help you work through it so that you don't suffer, emotionally, as much.|`|W6w6J9zPaa	well i kinda went through the same situation about 5 years ago when my best friend died in an accident (brutally as witnesses said).<br>  I just couldn't stop thinking about thinking about him. we went to same school and same class.<br>  I didnt know what to do. think about him or not. its a passing phase but it could hurt u in the first place more than anyone else. I tried to avoid remembering much about him, I avoided going places that reminded me of him, objects, etc. it helped a lot. after the hot time passed i can be more relax thinking about him. I really miss him every time i remember him.<br>  but i kinda got over that. this may or may not not work 4 u but its worth trying.<br>  and about the so called "anger problem", i gotta tell u that thats some mutual feeling that u have. actually there's a bigger fact about this.<br>  Ur feelings and acts will come back to u. actually ppl are connected to each other in universe, by that I mean when u do some special thing u will get more of that same kind.<br>  ppl unconsciously transmit some kinda energy pulses by what they do or even think, so being angry bring more of anger and so on.<br>  I myself am an angry guy (personal experiences) but at least i try not to think much about my problems, I keep myself busy using my PC, working harder and finding new hobbies.<br>  if u like to talk more about this just add my Y! id.<br>  mhdfdt<br>  hope it helps a bit.
kJGic2kqaa	its an evil shape shifting monster. cut it off and hide|`|kUlZCbhNaa	Your Penis has nothing to do with the Bowel.  <br>  <br>  If your penis is hurting sometimes it is a sign of excessive masturbation so stop for a few days.  If the pain is still there after a day or so you better go and see a doctor.<br>  <br>  If you haven't been playing with it are you keeping it clean by showering daily?  If you are not you may have an infection which you will need to go to a doctor for treatment.|`|eLRhPpD6aa	call A&E!!!!!!|`|11n031iraa	Your penis and bowel are in fact more connected than many people believe (hence anal pleasure occasionally resulting in ejaculation) and it sounds like as your bowels shifted, you moved your penis in such a way that the foreskin rolled up above the head of the penis and stayed there. This is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  If this has never happened to you before it may be a bit sensitive. The only thing that will have changed will be that now you can access the glans and frenulum of the penis, you should clean it regularly to avoid infections and a build up of smegma.<br>  <br>  Just roll your foreskin back over your penis and enjoy life. :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|vpKhZvYraa	I'm not too sure, but I do know of a place that can certainly help you. I forget the name but it's this great place where you get seen by someone who knows more about your problem than most, and he's specially trained too! You get to read old magazines in a waiting room, hang around with other sick people and nervously glance around to nosily see what's wrong with everyone else, and catch them trying to do the same to you! And also, there won't be a bunch of people who think they know what they're talking about when they really don't telling you that you have 'Shiftiralis Genitalitis' when it could be a number of things and only thourough testing can really tell.<br>  <br>  If you can remember the name of that place, i suggest you go there instead of Yahoo answers|`|2vftoAjBaa	It changed its shape?

Tj25eD49aa	There are many low in calorie and in fat lunches out there that you can simply microwave and eat, but if that is not what you want, bring a simple sandwich, whole wheat, with low fat/lean ham or turkey or chicken, and some lettuce. (Some lean grilled chicken would be my choice, might be better filling) Add some tomatoes or other things you might want. Then bring some fruit and possibly some nuts to finish it off. Water or some other drink could be brought too<br>  Hope i helped! :D|`|poeWy4YCaa	bumblebee flavored tuna fish.....
AA12385489	I took Aviane for seven years.<br>  <br>  When you start them is up to you since you'll be on its schedule anyhow.<br>  <br>  Aviane is a 28 day pack and you should get your period on the third sugar pill for a 28 day cycle.  You don't get it on the first sugar pill.<br>  <br>  Yes, you are protected on the sugar pills no matter when you get your period during them, but only starting with the second pack.  This is your first pack so you're not protected.  Use a condom as back up.

b258cdf375503d02e498c86e7018a1a6aa	Start with a trampoline, or, at least a swimming pool. What you need to learn is momentum and cordination. The effort is to propel your  lower haalf above, and through, your upper half. the transfer of momentum all must work together. Throw your body up and back and bring your knees inward. This momentum, if strong enough, should rotate your body back around.|`|38884d349b9481e2cc08f324197bca7aaa	Yeah Ive been asking the same question.  I agree with the gymnastics thing. But I dont have anything like that around, and maybe u dont either.  Right now im doing alot of stretching and I little martial arts workouts.  But i do know one thing,  make your core is strong, and your back isnt on the brink. Also take into account your own shape.  Not in the physical sense but you have to be relaxed.  I had back problems and tried it, haha, DONT, unless u want to end up in a wheel chair any time soon.  **** that sucks, I got back problems at 18 yrs.  Damn, aye good luck man, go to "Collegehumor.com", theyve got some funny stuff on there bout this stuff|`|AA10378537	GO to a few gymnastics lessons. You need to stretch a lot, and practice your back bends... like lowering to the ground and standing up from a backbend. YOu need to be pretty good at these before starting lessons.

My partner "feels different" around that time. "Thicker padding" is how I describe it, but that is from my perspective.... by this I mean that vaginal lubrication feels stickier and the vaginal walls feel sort of spongier than othertimes. My partner does not cramp at ovulation but sure does during her period.|`|lvI7TJijaa	Yeah when i cramp i usually do.
0025cc7a930f2d6aa6898b13e10d171baa	Your husband needs some self-discipline when it comes to brushing teeth. It only takes two times a day, preferably after breakfast and after dinner. Just tell your husband that if he doesn't brush his teeth, they will eventualy fall out (obviously), and that not brushing them will cause kidney problems and other stomach problems. Just keep encouraging him to brush them and tell him the long-term affects of not brushing them. Afterall, it should not take no more than 10 minutes out of your day (5 minutes in morning 5 at night). Well goodluck with your husband and i hope i helped.|`|AA11561290	That is sick, I didn't realize how many people don't have basic personal hygiene.|`|6b0d987e690e37ddeee2f56137deb0a6aa	Tell him his breath smells and you wont kiss him anymore!|`|79bb0265890df9b0d70df5312c12ca2daa	same problem here, I wont kiss my husband anymore....he still doesn't get it, good luck!|`|7cf79f66f5f626dd1210993e5b42668aaa	Have you talked to your husband about this?

It perfectly depends on how you value your marriage. But if you like it please you may tell him thathe could do you afavour by brushing it.

Personally mine never caused it for me, but someone else could take the same pill and spot for 2 months, and that would be totally normal.  It's just your body getting used to the new pill.  It can happen from a high hormone pill, or a low one.  The only thing you can do is make sure you take the pill at the same time every day.  Other than that it might take a month or two, but it should go away eventually.  If it doesn't after a couple months, then you should tell your doctor.  Also like the person above me said, it wouldn't hurt to take a pregnancy test.|`|H2h1XRbCaa	it is prob just the amount of hormone change. I wouldn't worry too much. Just to ease your mind you may want to take a preg test though
NKJb9sUMaa	You have a couple of options here.  First of all, it is usually safe to "wait out" an outbreak depending on how severe it is.  If you are handling the symptoms fine now - the outbreak may very well resolve on its own.  While valtrex is expensive, generic acyclovir works as well (some say not as well, but it still works) and is a LOT less expensive.  If you don't have insurance try a walk-in clinic or a planned parenthood.  Also there may be an STD clinic in your area.  If you have to sneak this by your father I have told my young patients to tell their parents it is an "antibiotic" which is somewhat true and less specific.|`|qbLB8FMcaa	I dont know how any one could just tough it out.

It's too expensive to take it every single day and it makes me nauseous. <br>  <br>  If you can stick it out without the medication then I wish you the best of luck! It will be a lot easier with the medication, but like I said before, the outbreaks can go away without it!<br>  <br>  Have you ever thought about getting on a cheaper medication like acyclovir or famvir? They both work really well, I've tried them both.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
WgLjQ1lKaa	You received  a good answer out of erik but from personal experience I thought I'd throw in my comments. There are some that have the dark circles like my 41 yr. old son who has had them since infancy. He has no problems with sinitus or any other known alergies. He works out with a trainer, eats healthy and drinks tons of water daily. I find that really curious because I have had asthma and sinus problems all my life... Guess what!? I don't have the dark circles.....Hmmm, so I don't know what is up with that. As far as Claritin goes....I would first try over the counter Dye Free Benedryl gel tabs for these reasons..... Benedryl use to be a prescription drug only (in the US) it is now sold over the counter in half the prescription dose. It is used in the hospitals to counter act an alergic drug reaction, a reaction to a bee sting, spider bite etc. There are several speciality types of Benedryl but I use the one in the pink box and it works wonders. Here's another tip....compare the ingredients of Benedryl with Sleep Eze and several other over the counter sleep remedies...the ingredients of Sleep Eze and many other sleep remedies are the same. And, always compare the ingredients of what you intend to consume. Read up on it....below is a link to start with. Anyway, Benedryl has been around for a very long time and in my opinion is still the best all time solution for allergic reaction. Other than that I would suggest investigating further as to what you are eating or what exactly the polutant's are that are aggravating your condition if any......Is it possible that dark circles are hereditary? When was the last time you had your eyes checked? There are tons of possible causes and I don't think friendly YA is the place start looking for the answers....There may be an underlying cause that only a professional can diagnose. If you have a good primary care physician start with him....and also introduce yourself to a good nutritionist for the purpose of homeopathic remedies. After you have exhausted all efforts within your means then the only thing you can do is live with it. Believe you me....there is much worse.|`|vgcGR3Aoaa	I see this a lot with people that have sinusitis and allergies.  We call them "allergic shiners".  There's not a lot you can do about them since they will come and go with your allergic seasons.  When I remove kids adenoids, they will often get better, but not predictably...  i.e. don't ask an ENT to get rid of your adenoids to cure your allergic shiners...  they will smile and call in the psychiatrists...<br>  <br>  I guess as a first try, if you are desperate, you could try something like Claritin to treat underlying allergic rhinitis.  If it helps, great, you've found your cure...|`|z2gOkykPaa	I had similar problem but i saw many stars under my eyes after many days I find out I am very tired & week , i faced to lack of vitamin

You can also take one Advil and one Tylenol. That always worked for me. Make sure to take with a full glass of water, milk or a little food.

Start with two, and if it doesnt kick in soon take a third. Gel caps work faster. <br>  <br>  Next, take a hot shower/bath directing the shower head to your lower back. If you have a jet tub, thats better. Or use a heating pad  on your lower back.

But I keep trying to find a positive and I always do. I am dealing with a lot of stress, short preview, I have a son in Iraq, I lost my job because of health reason, I have asthma, COPD, and I wheeze just walking and doing house work, I'm 47, I have intestinal problems and basically can't eat with out severe pain. So hey if I can find something positive, I bet you won't have to look real hard.  There is always someone out there who has it worse, and I am grateful for all I do have.

KvyNMxjOaa	A yawn occurs because the body never really get rid of all of the Carbon Dioxide when you exhale. Therefore, a yawn is a deep contraction of the diaphragm to squeeze the lungs as much as possible. Yawns are not contagious in the usual sense, it is however an on sight "response", in that, you yawn when you see another person yawn.|`|2pdP5Proaa	This is quite an interesting question. If I remember correctly, while studying neuroscience we had a lecturer present us with some random facts in regards to yawning, and I believe he stated that yawning is defined as a complex interaction between the brain, and the various muscle groups within the body.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, a yawn is a reflex of inhalation and exhalation that draws more oxygen into the bloodstream.<br>  <br>  In relation to yawning, and contagiousness, it would be some interesting research; however, I don't believe anyone could answer this question with legitimate scientific facts.|`|NkrctTmWaa	im yawning cuz ur boring me luv u|`|af7895adb1593a1f877e07308aaa4f44aa	Just reading the title of your question made me yawn!|`|9db58f2a42761d62ac1f4b75ccc601bbaa	Hah, it totally works! I read that and yawned, and I knew thats what the question would be about. Most people know this by now, so a lot of times I catch people trying to start a room full of yawn, but you can always tell because they overexaggerate it and look around during it. If you want to start a chain yawn, just act casual while you do it. <br>  <br>  You got me this time though!|`|AA11428760	They are obviously *mentally* contagious, not really *physically* contagious.

17b088d67647626fb8f52e0b628f36f1aa	A breast lift (mastopexy) is a surgical procedure to raise and reshape sagging breasts. Unlike breast augmentation, it does not change the size or firmness of your breasts.<br>  <br>  During a breast lift procedure, your surgeon moves your nipple and areola to a higher position and removes excess skin from beneath your breast. Closing the remaining skin tightens and lifts the breast. In breast augmentation, your surgeon places an implant behind your breast tissue or a layer of chest wall muscle.<br>  <br>  Breast lift procedures achieve the best results in women with small breasts, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Breasts of any size can be lifted, but the results may not last as long in heavy breasts.<br>  <br>  Breast lift and breast augmentation procedures are generally safe when performed by a qualified plastic surgeon. In evaluating whether you might need a breast lift or breast augmentation, your doctor will consider:<br>  <br>  Size and shape of your breasts <br>  Condition of your skin <br>  Placement of your nipples and areolas <br>  Sometimes a breast lift is done at the same time as the breast augmentation.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	Surgery is an option but not everyone can afford to have surgery like that... there are a couple of things that can improve (wearing a good supportive sports bra) whilst getting a good amount of exercise can strengthen the muscles in the chest which can help lift them.  it is possible to train them a little, just make sure you have lots of good bras and never exercise without wearing a sports bra. Also if you have to display them lifting your arms above your head (and maybe crossing them behind your head) pulls the muslces that will lift them a bit making them look perkier|`|00f259578c195aaa2de743a52a4e43ddaa	The bad news: There's no way to get "perky" breasts other than surgery.  <br>  <br>  The good news:  Most women have different sized breasts, so that is completely normal.  AND you are a self-conscious teenager.  Your breasts are most likely not as bad as you perceive.  Find a bra that gives you the appearance of perky boobs so you can feel good about yourself whilst clothed.  You shouldn't have to worry about what they look like unclothed for some time!  And everyone's gets droopy after having babies, so you're definately not alone.|`|AA10220663	You would probably have to wait until you are a litttle older, but all of these things are fixable by a plastic surgeon. You can get the size breasts that you want as well as a breast lift which will have them heading in the right direction. (quite perky as a matter of fact) The plastic surgeon will make them the exact same size too. So, don't worry, when you are old enough to have the surgery, probably 18...go for it.

cc8a1da5bcd8a28a3d70ec6a97690a79aa	What people usually do if they want to gain weight is, bulk first, then cut the fat out later. Most people do not have the "genes" to be able to bulk + cut fat at the same time. I do not know if you're a "hard gainer" or not either.<br>  <br>  You want to gain roughly 15lbs which is not THAT much. Have you started a weight training regime? 10-15lbs gain is about average for a new person starting weight training in about 2 months or so. Just keep more and more often. I wouldn't suggest trying to do both improving cardio + gaining weight at the same time. You want to maintain your cardio (1-2x a week) while lifting weights (3-4 times a week). Push the weights, do not do cardio too hard.|`|8adaee4d7c00fba93369990d397c3327aa	It's very difficult to do without steriods.  Anyone that tells you different is either lying or doesn't know much about nutrition.  That's why there's a bulking phase and a cutting phase.<br>  <br>  If you're really really determined and want to do it anyways.  I suggest you cut creatine from your diet (if you're taking it), add ZMA, glutamine, Hydroxycut, and Ephedra.  They're not steriods, but they're the healthiest and least dangerous (remember even Tylenol is dangerous), which means they will work a bit...but like I said, only steriods will let you gain muscles and lose body fat at the same time....and I dont' touch steriods.

Does he take Rolaids, or anything for stomach problems? It's not good for people to drink alot of sports drinks, and don't do alot of physical activity. Their bodies do not use the drink properly and the calcium in them builds up and causes kidney stones. People think that it is just as good, if not better to drink sports drinks instead of water. But those drinks should only be used by people doing any very physical activity. Not by someone just "sweating". You body needs to be in a high drive to use the nutrients properly. And as I said before, if you take alot of anti-acid, that can lead to alot of calcium build up as well.|`|dQf7Qs5aaa	I had a friend in highschool who got kidney stones when she was 18.

qsRuwn6Aaa	I used to work in addictions and recovery and I can remember cringing anytime someone came in with a benzodiazipine addiction.<br>  <br>  What can happen, depends on the amount of time between doses and the milligram of the tablet.  If memory serves, Xanax comes in doses of 0.25 mg to 2 mg tablets with administration every 6-8 hours as needed for anxiety.  Few people are on Xanax or other benzo's on a scheduled routine because of the potential for addiction and severe side effects.<br>  <br>  Any prescription drug taken without a physician's prescription, is illegal; both on the part of the person who took the drug and the person who provided the drug.<br>  <br>  Some of the problems that can arise from taking benzodiazipines are seizure activity, respiratory retardation and distress, nausea and vomiting (which can cause aspiration of the person has passed out), constipation, and addiction of the behavior continues.  <br>  <br>  If the person is taking any drug, just to take it, the potential for abuse obviously already exists.  Just taking one suggests that the individual is just "testing the waters," but to take six, suggests this is not the first time the individual has tried the drug and quite possibly there may be an addictive behavior or depressive tendancies that needs to be addressed before something serious occurs.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Peace,<br>  <br>  Beki|`|0f5bde1b2216d0f1e56f414533deb238aa	6 tablets is way too many.

ilR2p1FNaa	Well, the odds are that it's not going to seriously hurt you.  But the problem is that if you are doing it, you are probably going through so much inner turmoil that it's unbearable for you and you're doing this because it's the only thing you can think of doing to take away what's on your mind.  I know because I did this as a teenager.  Back then I thought I was the only one that did it - it never even occurred to me that other people might do it or that there was even a name for it - "cutting."  Years later I saw something about "cutters" on the television and it made me so sad because I had no idea so many other people did this and it was truly upsetting to realize that there were such large numbers of (mainly) women who had so much pain bottled up in them.  <br>  <br>  It won't kill you to cut yourself, but if you can, ask yourself if there is any other way to deal with your emotional pain.  I did eveything the hard way when I was younger as a way to deal with what I was going through, so if I could give one bit of advice, it would be to try as hard as you can to realize how much you're worth.  It helps to know that.  When we don't, we do things to hurt ourselves and that's not good :)|`|R3pM4lbxaa	thers not a dam thing wrong with it. people just dont understand. cutting is a way to control your pain. most cutters either do it for attention, or because their is so much pain in their life, they need to control a little but of it. me, i just like the blood and pain. yes, i am a freak, but thats not the point|`|jOu7WtR8aa	Cutting circumvents the skin's biological function, mainly to prevent internal infection. It's not much different from piercing except that piercings are usually cared for better.|`|7b986930e33c4b6e9b7111d939f5cbdeaa	Because just like being an alcoholic or a junkaholic, your trying to numb the  pain and the problems, instead of facing it and dealing with it. If you have an "out" for lifes problems, like cutting, you arent going to get very far. Like some alcoholics drink, instead of dealing with it, they wont ever learn to deal with life, and thats no way to live.|`|5653fc9f39ebe3768412dffbf3280936aa	It's not normal or good to binge on bad food and it's not good to cut either.  If cutting was OK to do we wouldn't knock people out for surgery.  This is going to sound bad, but there's a saying in many ER's, If you're going to do it, go vertical.  Cut across and we'll just laugh at you in the ER.  In all seriousness, cutting invites infection since your skin is compromised.  If for no other reason than to save yourself unnecessary hospital and antibiotic time.
e9549c5993a6fc71ddcaa4ed8d865720aa	Aluminum is found in Antiperspirant not Deodorant. There is a difference between the two.  A simple deodorant does nothing to keep you from sweating.  A simple deodorant does not contain aluminum. An antiperspirant by itself is rare, most are scented and are called antiperspirant/deodorant which contains an ingredient that keeps one from sweating called aluminum chlorohydrate.  This has been known to cause lumps in women and men that have been mistaken for breast cancer. Not much medical evidence linking it to breast cancer but if one wants to be safe they should switch to a deodorant alone. A great one is from Burt's Bees. Its all natural and works quite well. You  will still sweat however but sweating is a natural and a healthy thing.|`|b4d86f4161f7fd0e73ccc2742d82adeaaa	Have you also read the studies in which NO link was found?  If anything in anti-perspirant caused breast cancer, men would have the same rates of the disease as women do.  You are more likely to be killed in the car on the way to the store to buy special deodorant than to get cancer from antiperspirant.<br>  <br>  A  friend of mine has NEVER worn antiperspirant because she claims that Chinese people don't sweat (she is WRONG and leaves nauseating fumes wherever she goes), yet she's had breast cancer TWICE.  Consider how many foods are packaged and/or cooked in aluminum. Are you going to stop eating and drinking canned substances, too?<br>  <br>  That said, Adidas supposedly makes an aluminum-free alternative to antiperspirant for women.  You can probably find it at Walgreen's and similar drug stores.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to stop using anti-perspirant, please, Please, PLEASE bathe and change your clothes a few times a day so the people around you won't have to suffer.|`|05ab996294b6d02bb51b3a7b0e7e877baa	Instead of using deodorant, try using rubbing alcohol in spray bottle because it's much cleaner and safer.|`|69614e7253266531ded17974bd70fef2aa	Natural deodorant like the "Tom's from Maine" brand|`|AA10740755	I use the Adidas brand deodorant.

Try the Crest White Strips but if you done get really good results then you can always go to your dentist and have them make you the whitening trays. They are a little expensive and insurance does not cover them but you will be very satisfied with the results.

It has the same effectiveness rate as oral contraceptives, and the possible side effects are similar: breakthrough bleeding (spotting), nausea, slight weight gain, and the like. NuvaRing is a flexible, two-inch diameter ring made of a silicone-like material that's inserted deep into your vagina where the vaginal muscles will keep it in place. Once inserted, it will steadily release a low dose of hormones that will offer over 99% effectiveness against pregnancy. After 21 days, you remove and discard the ring, and wait 7 days before inserting a new one; you'll have your menstrual period during the 7 ring-free days. If for any reason the ring gets dislodged from your vagina, simply rinse it with tap water and insert it again immediately. Neither you nor your partner would "feel" the ring during intercourse; it won't interfere with the spontaniety of sex, since you'll be protected at all times. There's no need to remember to take a pill every day; for this reason it is ideal for teens and women who have trouble remembering to take her medications. For more details on this contraceptive method, go to the following links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nuvaring.com/Consumer/new/aboutNuvaRing/index_flash.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nuvaring.com/Consumer/new/abo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/handouts/nuvaring/nuvaring.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/handouts/nu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/Health/nuva.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellesley.edu/Health/nuva.htm...</a>

Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the calorie calculator <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/caloriecalclb.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...</a>  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Beginners Guide to Dieting  - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/begdieting.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/b...</a>
VQ57KP32aa	Well how much you lose and how long it took depends on that person alone and its not the same with anyone.<br>  <br>  I personally like to run.  So I walk/run 30 minutes each day.  I am thin already so I try not to lose weight, but I know it'll work.  Also try swimming, it works on all parts of your body and gets your lungs even working better.  Plus combine this with a balanced diet and you will be losing the weight, not dramatically but you will.  Now because summers approaching I'm trying to get some abs.  To do this I do crunches, side crunches, V-sits, and other ab workouts.  Its a good way to tone your body.<br>  <br>  Try to stay off pills though. =)|`|92f1df0f5a99ef299a724e303cf00a05aa	Last summer and fall  I lost 35 lbs.  I rode my exercise bike for 30 min. each day.  I did take one day off per week.  I did about 100 crunches about 3x a week.  I did not eat anything that had high fructose corn syrup, enriched flour (white or wheat) and partially hydrogenated oils.  It was tricky figuring out what I could eat, but I finally figured it out.  It can be a little expensive, but after you lose the first 10 lbs, it totally becomes worth it!

To see muscular definition, you must decrease body fat.  Again, you cannot spot reduce.  There is no exercise that will decrease localized fat.  First, look at your diet.  This is number ONE!  There's no cutting around it.  If you eat well, you will lose body fat, and if you don't eat well, you can kiss those abs goodbye.  I would suggest als lifting heavy weights, and doing some sort of intense cardio.|`|AA12291697	Do crunches or situps. This will tone your abs, assuimg there is no fat there.|`|sPtx0bnQaa	EASY do crunches and leg raises becuase crunches works the upper abs and leg raises work the lower abs (stomach) there are many lower workouts but leg raises tend to be the elite lower body workout as with crunches.

You have to lose the fat around the abs and the only way to do that is through diet and cardio.|`|38884d349b9481e2cc08f324197bca7aaa	My question too, and I do have the solution!!  at least for me.  What I do now, cause before I was doing to much is simple and works.  Well first if your out of shape you gotta work that fat off man then workout starts.  If you do ab workouts that take 30 or more reps in a set thats not going to build muscle because then your just conditioning your muscles.  Weights are the key.  Crunches, regular crunches will work great, but with weight, dont hold it to your chest but put it behind your head for more restistence.  Do 3 sets and increase your weight 5 lbs each set.  If you can do 20 or more reps with the weight u have easily u need to up your weight.  Remember, slow and controlled, not as fast as you can.  Start out with 18 first set,put 5lbs on,16(5lbs more), then 14 reps/ your last set.  At the end of each set hold your "up" position for 10 seconds and slowly lower yourself.  Excersise 2:  lay flat on the floor/ back to floor and place weights on you ankle near the feet.  Now lift your legs slowly up and down without touching the ground.  Use the same guidelines as the crunches.  Now u can do the cable machine.  Get on your knees facing the cable machine with the with bar being held firmly almost touching the top of your head.  Now crunch down.  Use same steps with weights and reps as with the other excersises.  With the cable excersise you have to make sure your abs are pulling the weight down, NOT your hips, they cant help else it'll be a waist of time.  These are just a few examples.  but after your workout u should take in high amounts of protein and remember to do cardio work.  And a secret to being more defined in the mid sectioin is EPHEDRA.  its an energy pill for truckers, etc, but once u get the good abs and want just a little more for the club and the night out it will help quite a bit.  Do these routines 3 to 4 days a week, good luck|`|750a59973dc9bb97917387679fc2b66faa	juss excersise and burn off fat|`|83c9a7d2a4d3da7e9c3b0ec9e46e3c24aa	k listen to me i just started working on my abs and i basically have a six pack. You must not have any fat on ur abs, or very little. Crunches will not burn the fat off they will make ur abdominals stronger. So jog, bike, run. To burn the fat off your stomach. And do 100 crunches a day. Crunches not situps. Situps are bad for your back and crunches work easier. If your fat it will take longer because u have fat on your stomach covering up your abs. If your around 150 it will take bout a month to get a sixpack|`|AA12303401	350 sit ups a day!!!|`|b7073803fddab853ad4c727d04974451aa	Cardio. Don't just focus on doing situps or crunches. You need cardio for burn off some of that fat. Even then, you may not have perfect abs. It depends upon genetics.
AA10738972	I am convinced that a sensible eating plan is essential to losing and keeping off the weight, partly because you are eating good food and enhancing your health while losing, also because you lose at a moderate rate that gives the body time to adjust and to let go of stored fat.  I recently joined Weight Watchers.  In the first two weeks I lost 5 pounds, do not go hungry, and feel much more energy, probably due to the fruits, veggies, fiber, and water that I never used to get enough of.  I walk for exercise, and expect to lose 2 lbs. a week, so will be at 10 in 2 more weeks, and total 20 lbs in 5 weeks after that.  WW knows how to attain permanent loss, how to fix a plateau.

There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. <br>  <br>  *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. <br>  <br>  Avoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

Do some basic research on nutrition, learn about the different food groups, macro-nutrients and their place is your diet. A typical healthy diet is based around fruit and vegetables, wholegrain carbohydrates, fish and lean meat, low-fat dairy, and unsaturated fats from nuts and seeds. Spread your food intake throughout the day (6 meals). Be careful to not eat too little however, as this can hinder your weight loss just as much as eating too much. Around 1-2lb a week is a healthy weight loss. For a workout, weight training 3 times a week, lifting as heavy as possible, using basic, compound exercises (squats, bench press, etc). Do cardio on the non workout days (running, swimming, cycling).|`|9753d66fd7ac35b75a2187eb8d4ddbc9aa	Below is my home-made diet, it's not a fad diet or a crash diet at all.=)<br>  <br>  Do not make a high goal, first of all. It's a health risk to lose more than 3 pounds a week and can decrease your confidence. Besides, that much in a week would probably be water weight, which comes right back.<br>  <br>  Try taking a walk for 30 minutes a day, adding 10 minutes each week. Once you get up to an hour long walk, start biking or jogging for 20 minutes a day, adding on minutes once again. By the time you are biking or jogging for an hour a day, just keep at it and you'll keep losing.<br>  <br>  If your weight doesn't move, don't sweat it. It's because you are gaining muscle mass and losing fat at the same time. Did you know muscle weighs DOUBLE that of fat while taking up the same amount of space? It does! If you feel really bad about your weight not changing though, do some mesurments. They will probably be lower numbers.<br>  <br>  Remember to EAT YOUR BREAKFAST. Eating Breakfast will reduce your hunger and increase your energy throughout the day. You should have a large breakfast, smaller lunch, and light dinner. Or you can have multiple small meals throughout the day. Avoid snacking at night (after 9 PM), and when you really want junk food, eat a half serving and substitute the other half with a fruit or veggie. Make sure you drink water too, it's helpful in losing weight faster. Be sure to lay off soda...it's high in cals.<br>  ------------------------------<br>  <br>  The types of things to watch out for:<br>  <br>  -High-sodium foods; they make you retain water. If you are outside sweating tons, it is great for you, but if you are indoors in the AC, don't go nuts eating it. It does make you gain weight when you retain too much water, it also makes you chubbier.<br>  <br>  -High saturated fat and trans-fat foods; too much of this stuff can put you at risk for heart disease and make your BAD cholesterol shoot up significantly.<br>  <br>  ------------------------------<br>  <br>  The types of things to go ahead and gobble:<br>  <br>  -Foods with monounsaturated fats; These lower total cholesterol and bad cholesterol while raising the good cholesterol.=)<br>  <br>  -Foods with polyunsaturated fats: These do the same thing, though they will not raise good cholesterol.<br>  <br>  -Fiber; this is a natural laxitive and is good for weight loss.

Look it up, it should be everywhere you type in "leukic", maybe look up "No Shotgun" too... Dont take steroids, side effects  = penis shrink, heart attack, you could overlift and hurt yourself, plus if your in high school or any state league steroids are illegal.  And its not exactly the steroids that make you bigger, well they are a big part of extra growth, but it also strongly depends on how hard you train, and what kind of routine you have.  Please dont take steroids, unless your a lifter like "Worlds Strongest Man, Joka Hola" I wouldnt consider them.  Joka Hola was an unbelievably powerful lifter and WITHOUT steroids he could still beat the ones that WERE on roids.  Leukic is probably fine, Im not to adept on its class and uses, but you should really look into this carefully before you start...

ea998e6d5375bd90056eb379d9dd22ceaa	HOW DOES WHAT YOU EAT POWER THE MUSCLE CELLS?<br>  Although carbohydrates supply the majority of the energy for muscles during vigorous activity, fats can be a major contributor for less strenuous activities. Carbohydrate is stored as glycogen in muscle and liver cells. On a normal diet there is enough glycogen to support 2 hours of aerobic exercise before the bonk occurs. These internal stores can be extended by using oral carbohydrate supplements for events expected to last more than 2 hours. It is best to begin the carbohydrates at the start of the event as they are much less effective after the bonk has occurred. A well trained cyclist will need slightly more than 1 gram of carbohydrate per minute to sustain maximum performance, and oral supplementation (started at the beginning of the exercise, not after glycogen depletion has occurred) should replace carbohydrate at that rate.<br>  In addition to extending the time to fatigue in longer, moderate activity events, several studies have also suggested that maximal performance in a 1 hour, high intensity (time trial, ~80% VO2max) event can be improved with oral carbohydrate supplementation. Drinking a total of 1 liter of a 7% carbohydrate solution at the beginning and during the event improved times by 2%.<br>  <br>  Skeletal muscle oxidizes carbohydrate in the form of glucose, and other sugars must be converted to glucose by the liver before they can be used as fuel by the muscle. Studies have demonstrated no additional benefit for glucose polymers, fructose, or sucrose (common table sugar) which is a dimer of glucose and fructose, for carbohydrate replacement - aside from palatability. In large amounts, fructose can cause diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Although carbohydrates are superior to fats in supporting maximal performance, there is some controversy over the relative benefits of simple vs complex carbohydrates as the ideal supplement to be used during prolonged exercise. Examples of complex carbohydrates are rice (200 Cal per cup), spaghetti (180 Cal per cup), and baked potatoes (140 Cal per large spud). Examples of other carbohydrates.<br>  <br>  A shift toward fat metabolism may be the physiologic explanation for the "second wind" that occurs during exercise (internal carbohydrate stores have been used, fatigue sets in, the body shifts to fat metabolism, and the "second wind" or feeling of a renewed source of energy returns). However, the trade off is the inability to maintain performance at the same %VO2 max. that is possible with carbohydrate supported metabolism.<br>  <br>  Muscle fatigue (the "bonk" in cycling, "hitting the wall" in running) generally occurs when the body's internal carbohydrate stores are depleted and there is a shift towards fat metabolism as the prime energy source for the exercising muscle (with maximum energy output limited to approximately 50% VO2 max.). It would be logical to assume that if adequate carbohydrates (to offset those expended) were replaced during a ride, the cyclist could maintain his or her pace indefinitely. Unfortunately this is not the case. Cyclists with low muscle glycogen stores but high blood glucose levels still experience fatigue at some point, even though the time to onset of fatigue was delayed by taking the carbohydrate supplements. Unknown factors, perhaps related to physical changes in the muscle cell itself, are thought to be responsible as this type of fatigue is more common in the untrained athlete.(see also Overtraining)<br>  <br>  Fats provide over 50% of the Calories expended during moderate exercise (less than 50% VO2 max.) even when adequate carbohydrates (glycogen) are available. As the level of exercise increases towards 100% VO2 max., the proportion of the total energy expenditures replaced by fats diminishes. And in maximum performance events, where metabolism becomes anaerobic (greater than 100% VO2 max.), fat metabolism ceases and only carbohydrates are available as an energy source. Although there has been speculation that using fats in a dietary program both during training and as supplements during competitive events might improve athletic performance, the only hard evidence to date suggests that it may help endurance (performing at <50%VO2 max) athletes involved in long events while there has been no evidence of a benefit at higher performance levels ie 90 to 100% VO2max.<br>  <br>  Protein is a maintenance material being used to repair muscle (and other) cell injuries - including the microtrauma that occurs with exercise. It is NOT used by the body as an energy source except in very malnourished states. Even in endurance activities such as the Tour De france, protein needs of 1.5 gms protein/kg body wt/day were easily met by a normal (unsupplemented) diet that replaced the total Calories expended. A review of the literature failed to demonstrate any advantasge to protein supplements (assuming an adequate daily protein intake) over pure carbohydrate supplements alone. And one study actually demonstrated a DECREASE in overall performance from the appetite suppressing effects of a high protein diet, decreased carbohydrate intake, and as a result diminished pre event muscle glycogen stores.<br>  <br>  <br>  HOW LONG CAN YOU EXERCISE WITHOUT EATING? (What are your total internal energy stores?)<br>  In the well fed and rested state, the human body contains approximately 1500 carbohydrate Calories (stored as glycogen) in the liver and muscle tissue, and over 100,000 Calories of energy stored as fat. This is adequate carbohydrate for several hours of brisk cycling, and enough fat to continue to support cycling at a reduced speed (50 - 60% VO2@max) for days.<br>  In order to avoid the "bonk" (the shift to fat metabolism with an accompanying deterioration in performance), supplemental carbohydrates need to be eaten during the early stages of rides that will be more than longer than 1 to 2 hours in length to supplement (and thus spare) the body's own glycogen stores.<br>  <br>  <br>  OVERVIEW OF FACTORS AFFECTING DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION (more detail)<br>  Before we go any further, let's take a minute to discuss the role of the various parts of your digestive tract. <br>  Mouth - important to begin the mechanical breakdown of food and add some digestive enzymes in saliva <br>  Esophagus - transportation to the stomach <br>  Stomach - further mechanical and enzyme breakdown; no absorption <br>  Small intestine - completes enyzme breakdown and absorption of nutrients <br>  Colon - storage and dehydration of residual from processed food; no absorption of nutrients <br>  When designing a nutritional program to supplement the body's energy stores for an athletic event, the rate of digestion and absorption of foods must be taken into account. The time needed for the stomach to start the digestive process, empty its contents into the small intestine, and have the food components absorbed into the bloodstream will directly affect how quickly any food will be available to the muscle to provide the supplemental Calories for exercise.<br>  You have some control over four major factors influencing the digestive process.<br>  <br>  <br>  Solid versus liquid - liquids are emptied from the stomach more quickly than solids.<br>  <br>  Fat content of the food - fat slows the digestive process and delays the availability of any Calories in the food to the muscles.<br>  <br>  Sugar concentration - especially in liquids, a sugar content of more than 10% will slow stomach emptying. (The use of complex carbohydrates, due to the decreased osmotic effect, will offset this to some degree and offers an alternative strategy to maximize Caloric intake to offset the metabolic needs of exercise.)<br>  <br>  Physical activity level of the cyclist - the mechanical activity of digestion is slowed by any vigorous activity, usually starting at 70% VO2 max. Except in short, all out events, this is rarely an issue, and it is much less so for cycling than for running where the additional component of mechanical stimulation of abdominal contents from the sport itself slows digestive tract functioning.<br>  <br>  From the above four points, it is easy to see that the optimal food for a rapid, high energy boost during a ride would be a semi-liquid or liquid carbohydrate with minimal if any fat. On the other hand, an endurance athlete, competing at a lower VO2 max., might prefer a complex carbohydrate with some fat added to improve taste (and generally in a solid form), in order to slow emptying from the stomach and even out absorption over a longer period of time.<br>  Carbonation does not appear to affect the emptying rate of the stomach. Three independent studies found no difference in the gastric emptying rates of water, carbonated water, and carbonated carbohydrate drinks. Carbonated colas, which contain 160 Calories per 12 ounce can and the caffeine equivalent of half a cup of coffee, remain a favorite drink of many cyclists.<br>  <br>  <br>  EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ON THE DIGESTIVE TRACT<br>  Serious athletes often develop gastrointestinal (GI) disorders during training and competition - generally cramps, diarrhea, and nausea (although constipation has been reported). Cramps and diarrhea reflect an overactivity of the lower intestinal tract or colon, and are much more common in runners (and thus triathletes) than in cyclists. A recent survey of triathletes participating in a half iron man event revealed that 50 % complained of belching and flatuence (gas), and more symptoms occurred while running than at other times.<br>  Studies have demonstrated a reduced blood flow to the digestive system during vigorous exercise - an 80% reduction after 1 hour cycling at 70% VO2max. And there was a direct relationship in that individuals with the most severe symptoms had the greatest decrease in blood flows. The type of exercise also plays a role, and it is specualted that the mechanical trauma (a jostling effect) to the abdominal organs may explain why runners have more symptoms than cyclists or swimmers. Changes in GI hormone levels have been noted with vigorous exercise, but a cause and effect relationship to symptoms has not been proven. Stress factors are probably more important as a cause of pre competition symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (which in one study were present in 57% of the participants).<br>  <br>  Heartburn (or esophageal reflux)is more frequent when exercising within 2 hours of eating. The current feeling is that this increase in reflux is related to a combination of meal effects (especially fats) on the esophageal sphincter pressure (which prevents reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus), the increased volume of food and acid in the stomach available to reflux, and the mechanical jostling that occurs (especially with running). This is usually a minor problem for cyclists and is best handled by delaying exercise after eating or using an antacid of one of the over the counter acid reducing medications such as Tagamet or Zantac.<br>  <br>  Exercise delays stomach emptying, and the more vigorous the exercise, the greater the delay. Running once again appears to have a greater effect than cycling, presumeably because of the mechanical jostling of the stomach as well as other abdominal organs. In addition to the increase in esophageal reflux (noted above), the delay in stomach emptying can cause a sensation of fullness and nausea as well as limitign the immediate availability of Calories from the food eaten (as will be discussed shortly). In the survey referred to above, there appeared to be an additive effect from a high fat and protein pre event meal and the use of hypertonic drinks before and during the event. 40% of those drinking a hypertonic beverage had severe complaints compared with only 11% of those who had used isotonic drinks.<br>  <br>  An increase in small and large intestinal activity is the cause of abdominal cramps and is reflected in an increase in the frequency of defecation as well. It has been speculated that there might be changes in digestive hormones associated with exercise which then stimulate the colon. But it is more likely that once again the mechanical factor of jostling the bowel is a more important factor. A fiber rich, pre race meal can also play a role. In a recent post race survey, almost all the triathletes who had eaten a high fiber meal suffered from cramps. Minimizing cramps requires a focus on: <br>  <br>  avoiding electrolyte imbalance (including dehydration) <br>  avoiding riding too soon after eating <br>  training at a level closer to your event (the more your event exceeds the maximum levels of your training, the more likely you will develop crampy abdominal pain). <br>  Most of these issues are more problematic for runners (and thus triathletes) than cyclists. Except for competitive cyclists, the effects of exercise on the GI tract are minimal. <br>  <br>  If heartburn is a problem, timing of the ride to assure an empty stomach needs to considered (and for the competitive rider a 3 to 4 hour fasting period is already the recommendation to minimize a feeling of fullness and nausea). <br>  Slow gastric emptying is generally not a problem for a recreational rider, but those with an especially sensitive stomach should plan to eat their last pre ride meal at least 3 to 4 hours before the ride. Small, frequent snacks while on the bike are recommended for rides of greater than 2 hours, and if it is going to be a vigorous workout, avoiding hypertonic sports drinks is recommended. <br>  Stay hydrated. If you are dehydrated, the stomach will empty more slowly and there will be an accentuation of the decrease in blood flow to the small intestine. <br>  Although some racers will eat a low residue diet for several days before an event to minimize cramps and the "call to stool", this greatly complicates diet planning, and for the rest of us, slowing the pace will usually decrease the urge until a bathroom is located. <br>  So let's review the tips to decrease GI problems: <br>  pace yourself - the stomach empties better at <75%VO2max <br>  hydrate - dehydration leads to decreased stomach emptying and nausea <br>  avoid concentrated (hypertonic) solutions <br>  determine which foods work for you on your training rides <br>  eat on your training rides - your digestive tract will adapt to eating while exercising <br>  train - if you are in better shape, more blood will go to the digestive tract at any given level of exertion <br>  (additional information - Exercise and the Athlete - Presented at Sun Mountain Lodge 1/2004)<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS IN PLANNING YOUR DIET PROGRAM<br>  Carbohydrate loading<br>  <br>  The insulin surge and potential hypoglycemia that is theorized to occur if sugary drinks are taken in the minutes before a competitive event is a potential in sedentary individuals eating sweets, but rebound hypoglycemia does not appear to be a practical problem for athletes. However, choosing to err on the side of caution, most authorities recommend avoiding all simple carbohydrates for the several hours before an event, starting carbohydrate supplementation in the few minutes immediately preceding the start of the activity.<br>  <br>  Even though it appears that simple carbohydrates should be avoided in the hour or two immediately preceeding your ride, there is almost unanimous support for the benefits of a pre ride meal of complex carbohydrates 3 or 4 hours before the event. These carbohydrates not only "top off" your muscle and liver glycogen stores, the slow digestion and absorption of the complex carbohydrates may provide an ongoing glucose supplement from your intestinal tract even after the ride has started. And recent studies have demonstrated that using commercial energy bars or a high fat meal offer no performance advantages over a more traditional and less expensive complex carbohydrate such as oatmeal.<br>  <br>  Maximizing liquid carbohydrate replacement while riding is a very important strategy for events lasting more than 2 hours. 1 to 2 grams of carbohydrate per minute can be absorbed and utilized to sustain prolonged exercise. In extreme events such as the Tour de France, as much as 50% of the daily energy expenditures can be replaced while on the bike. Although the sugar concentration has an effect on the rate of stomach emptying, the volume of fluid in the stomach plays a role as well. Keeping the stomach filled by frequent drinks will enhance the rate of gastric emptying.<br>  As sugar concentration increases, the risk of nausea and bloating rises as well. Almost everyone can tolerate a 7 to 10% concentration of glucose, but many cyclists will tolerate solutions of up to 15% to 20%. And the use of polymers will allow more carbohydrates to be ingested and absorbed while limiting to some degree the overall concentration of the solution. Fluid replacement rates of 500 ml per hour are appropriate for the majority of cyclists during prolonged exercise, but rates of up to 1 to 2 liters per hour have been reported in the Tour de France. The risk here is hyponatremia with the larger volumes.<br>  <br>  As an example, starting an event with 400 ml of an 18% glucose polymer solution in the stomach and drinking 100 ml every 10 minutes will deliver 108 grams of carbohydrate with 600 cc of fluid every hour.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take advantage of the " glycogen window" that is open in the 4 hours immediately following vigorous exercise. During this interval, ingested carbohydrate will be converted into muscle glycogen at about 3 times the normal rate (and "the earlier the better" as some data suggests a 50% fall in the conversion rate by 2 hours and a complete return to normal repletion rate by 4 hours). Muscle glycogen repletion (after a 2 plus hour ride) usually proceeds at a rate of 5% per hour, and although it may require up to 48 hours for complete muscle glycogen replacement, most is accomplished during the first 24 hours post event. The athlete who is training daily, or is in a multiday event, can use this glycogen window to their advantage to get a jump on the normal repletion process and minimize the chance of chronic glycogen depletion (and the fatigue that goes along with it). There is also suggestive evidence that the muscle stiffness that occurs after vigorous exercise is related to muscle glycogen depletion, so rapid repletion may have an added benefit of minimizing this day after effect. One caution though - many simple carbohydrate snacks such as chocolate chip cookies are more than 30% fat and if eaten in large quantities might exceed your planned daily fat intake of 20-30% of Calories. In contrast, complex carbohydrate foods such as pasta, bread, and rice offer significantly more carbohydrate per gram or ounce. And there are even special "recovery drinks" available.<br>  <br>  Vegetarian diet. A growing number of cyclists are moving toward meatless meals or a completely meat free nutritional program. Not only are vegetarians healthier, with lower rates of chronic diseases such as heart disease, obesity, and colon cancer, but the fact that their diets are high in carbohydrates means they are constantly "carbo loaded".<br>  There are a few tips to remember if you are considering a life style change.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vegans, who eat no animal products whatsoever including dairy, need to be certain they get enough <br>  vitamin B12 (from supplements and fortified foods such as cereal, bread, pasta, and brewer's yeast) <br>  iron (from beans, kale, dried fruit, and collard greens). Don't use supplements unless recommended by your physician because of the potential toxicity of too much iron. <br>  calcium (dark leafy vegetables, brocoli, citrus fruits) <br>  Eat "balanced" protein (because of the mix of amino acids, non meat protein foods need to be eaten in combinations - same meal or in consecutive meals - to have the right balance of amino acid building blocks to allow the body to use them to build and repair tissue). <br>  pinto beans and rice <br>  grains (rice, bread, cereal) and legumes (peas or beans) <br>  Eat a bit more than if you were eating meat as a protein source. For example a 3 ounce piece of meat contains about 21 grams of protein and is can be substituted with a cup of cooked grain and a cup of cooked beans. <br>  OPTIMAL CYCLING DIET<br>  Is there an optimum diet for the cyclist?? There is overwhelming evidence that adequate dietary carbohydrates are needed for maximum performance. At least 10 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. What is unclear is whether more carbohydrate (beyond 600 to 700 grams per day) will provide additional benefits.(Note that it is the absolute amount of carbohydrates that appear to be important, not the % of total daily Calories that are carbohydrates).<br>  And Fat?? If you are interested in multiday endurance events, there may be some advantage to several weeks of a moderate fat intake equivalent to 30% of total Calories. But there is no evidence this helps in single day, high performance (%VO2max greater than 60%) activities and there may be long term health consequences. As total Caloric needs increase, the only reason to consider a high fat (more than 15 to 20% of total Caloric needs) diet would be maintenance of a positive Caloric balance IF carbohydrates alone were not meeting the challenge.<br>  <br>  And finally, there is NO evidence tha more than 2 grams per kg per day of protein are beneficial in endurance, sprint, or power training/performance.<br>  <br>  There are three additional practical points for the cyclist (or other athlete) to remember.<br>  <br>  First, the body's normal liver and muscle glycogen will support the first 1 or 2 hours of exercise at 70% VO2 max. without any need for supplementation. And both a good training program to improve the form and muscle efficiency of the individual as well as riding (or exercising) at a reasonable pace will postpone the onset of glycogen depletion and fatigue. <br>  <br>  Second is that taking in carbohydrates during the event provides an additional source of glucose "fuel" that will extend the length of time before the bonk occurs. This becomes important in rides of greater than 2 hours duration. As a general rule, the body can utilize 60 grams of ingested carbohydrate per hour to supplement muscle glycogen stores, and the stomach can handle between one and two quarts of fluid before nausea occurs. This does put an upper limit on carbohydrate supplementation during a ride but gives you some guidelines for developing your own program. And there is no problem in using solid food supplements as well, as long as enough fluids are taken along with them.<br>  <br>  Finally, eating a high carbohydrate diet for several days prior to the event will maximize your internal glucose (glycogen) stores, and will prolong the duration of activity until fatigue occurs.

b7c4d588c72eafb51a030d3ecaaf372caa	hydration is important and potassium helps with cramping but the absolute most important thing is to consume adequate protein. drink  a whey protein drink with at least 30-40grams of  protein right after working out and another one 1.5 to 2 hrs later. the 1st 4hrs post workout is a crucial time. then make sure to eat a good meal with plenty of protein and some complex carbs no more than 2 hrs after that and then throughout the day. Hypertrophy (muscle growth) is produced by  tearing down muscle "working out" and then rebuilding bigger. muscle is composed of amino acids "protein". Protein will help alleviate muscle soreness and fuel muscle growth. other important things are stretching pre and post workout "helps to oxygenate muscle and remove lactic acid", good sleep, glutamine, multi vitamin/anti oxidants, and if you ever want to join the big dogs, test/tren/d-bol (biochemistry at its best).

This will not allow muscle to heal. Try a split system. One day work the chest and triceps, next day shoulders and legs, next day back and biceps.

Make sure you stretch every muscle you're going to be working out.  Also, you will experience soreness if you OVERwork any muscle, make sure you're not overdoing it.  If you are lifting weights to increase muscle mass, don't just start out maxing.  Start out TONing with reps, then GRADUALLY build up in increments of about 10 lbs. per week of working out. (This is approximate.  You should probably have a trainer if you're not sure of your limits.)|`|AA10034577	Stretch.  Make sure you cool down as well.

So they can use their muscles for a long time at limited strength.<br>  <br>  I trained a guy who runs a 2 mile a little over 13 minutes and  I was very much against letting him squat--surprisely, he got great results--better times and less tired after he's runs. If you want to squat, I would recommend light weights, high sets and high reps. So, nothing over 135 lbs, 4-5 sets, 15-18 reps--this will increase your endurance and strength.<br>  <br>  Good luck and train hard!|`|hew8pqrmaa	Yes, they should because it stretches out the muscles that are needed to run long distances.  How many sets depends on your personal preferences.  You can talk to a personal trainer if you have one to setup a personal program that will suit your body better than me telling you.  Good Luck!  Keep up with the running!|`|jIJtzx0aaa	Squats are ok, but only at low weight, and moderate reps.  Otherwise you run the risk of doing damage to your knees.  Moreover, heavy squats build bulk muscle, not muscle tone, while light squats will help build tone. <br>  <br>  In my view, you are better off doing some leg presses or something more low impact than squats.  More time on a bike will help your distance running more than squats since distance running relies on muscle endurance which comes from having a well developed energy production system in the legs.

Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.  <br>  <br>  Also start counting your calories.  Write them down.  You would be amazed as to how much more aware you are of your caloric intake, if you actually write it down.  We recently discovered a site that offers a great program that counts calories, as well as keeps track of everything.  It allows multiple users, so everyone in the family can keep track.  They offer a free 7 day trial, and so far I am very impressed with the product.  Try the 7 days and see.  It allows you to add the exercise that you do during the day, which increases the amount of calories you can take in.  Very Cool!!<br>  <a href="http://www.calorieking.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.calorieking.com</a><br>  <br>  A sight with some really cool diet calculators and interesting calorie counting calculators is here.

What you can do, as everyone has suggested, is try to diet and exercise to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I would suggest setting up a fitness routine for 5-6 days a week, for about 30-45 minutes depending on how much time you have.  Remember that any exercise is good exercise!  Whether it's walking in your neighborhood or actually going to a gym, it's all about getting out there and MOVING!<br>  <br>  Another recommendation would be to watch your food intake.  Foods that are high in fiber and protein and low in calories and fat are the best foods you can put into your body!  Fruits and veggies, oatmeal, lean meat like chicken, fish, yogurt, skim milk, and WATER, WATER, WATER are essentials to your diet!<br>  <br>  I have found that keeping track of your calorie intake helps a great deal.  I eat about 1500 calories a day, and since last May I have lost about 30 pounds (I'm 5'1" and currently weigh 128 lbs, so it definitely made a difference).  I use www.calorie-count.com, but there are certainly other websites out there besides this one.  This one just works for me.<br>  <br>  Read nutrition labels when you grocery shop.  Buy new workout clothes if that's what motivates you.  Do whatever you can to get into this new routine, because it can be one of the best changes you've ever made in your life - it certainly was for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay positive!|`|xFuDLQXcaa	Read tips & articles on different types of diets, exercise programs, yoga & much more....<br>  <br>  All about weight loss, weight watchers, Tea diets, easy home exercises to name a few

Once you leave, you are free.|`|aIfY6BMBaa	I found this:<br>  <br>  [edit] Section 3<br>  Please note this section is significantly amended by Mental Health Act 2007 - see below<br>  <br>  Section 3 is a treatment order and can initially last up to six months; if renewed, the next order lasts up to six months and each subsequent order lasts up to one year. It is instituted in the same manner as Section 2, following an assessment by two doctors and an ASW. One major difference, however, is that for Section 3, the doctors must state which subcategory of mental disorder the person is suffering from i.e. mental illness, mental impairment, severe mental impairment or psychopathic disorder. Another difference is that a person cannot be detained under Section 3 if his or her Nearest Relative objects to the detention.<br>  <br>  Most treatments for mental disorder can be given under Section 3, including injections of psychotropic medication such as antipsychotics. However, after three months of detention, either the person has to consent to their treatment or an independent doctor has to give a second opinion to confirm that the treatment begin given remains in the person’s best interests. A similar safeguard is used for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), although the RMO can authorise two ECT treatments in an emergency situation for persons detained under Section 3.<br>  <br>  Absence or “leave” from hospital can be granted by the RMO for patients detained under either Section 2 or Section 3. The RMO will also ultimately be responsible for discharging patients from either Section 2 or Section 3. After a Section 3, a formal discharge planning meeting must be held, as stipulated in Section 117 of the Act. This makes informal plans for after-care following discharge.<br>  <br>  It seems you would have to have permission from your doctor in order to leave the country.|`|AA11976210	stop taking the crazy meds and seek Gods help|`|62ec322100d207c8b7da7d70d7a1cc44aa	you are allowed to work part time the website you should look at would be disability.org

If so, I'm sure you are aware that pull ups are the same exercise, put with (obviously) much more resistance.  Unfortunately, any machine that has variable resistance is going to have a pulley system of some type, making it bulky.  All you need for a good workout is a overhead bar, which I'm sure you can find just about anywhere with some ingenuity.  If you can't do pull ups due to your current strength, try doing isometric pull ups, or partial pull ups.  For the isometrics, you just pull without actually moving your body, which still builds the muscles.  As you progress you will eventually have the strength to do more and more, until you can do pull ups.  Also, if you are overweight, you can always lose some pounds to make pull ups easier.  Use removable plate dumbbells for all of your other exercises.

The lift prevents extra stretching of your Achilles tendon. <br>  While you are recovering from your injury, change your sport or activity to one that does not make your condition worse. For example, you may need to swim instead of run. <br>  Do any exercises your health care provider gives you to stretch and strengthen your Achilles tendon. <br>  If you over-pronate, your health care provider may recommend shoe inserts, called orthotics, to keep your foot stable. You can buy orthotics at a pharmacy or athletic shoe store or they can be custom-made. <br>  In some severe cases of Achilles tendonitis, your foot may be put in a cast for several weeks. <br>  A tear of the tendon may require surgery.

Luego, se deja que se seque sobre la cabe?za y finalmente se aclaran con agua.<br>  <br>  - Frotar el cuero cabelludo con aceite de hígado de pescado una vez por semana preferiblemente de noche, para luego lavarse la cabeza en la ma?ana siguiente.<br>  <br>  - Usar una loción de ortiga es efectiva. Inclusive la puedes hacer en casa. Para ello, puede comprar hojas de ortiga en una farmacia botánica en una cantidad equivalente a una taza. Luego la pones a hervir en medio litro de agua por aproximadamente 10 minutos. Lo dejas que repose toda una noche y te frotas con ella el cuero cabelludo. <br>  <br>  En todas estas recetas, si puedes observar, se frota el cuero cabelludo. Esta acción, además de los efectos benéficos de la ortiga, el aceite de pescado y del áloe vera respectivamente, resulta positivo, ya que activa la circulación sanguínea del área lo cual ayuda al crecimiento del cabello. <br>  <br>  Es importante seguir una dieta rica en vitaminas A y complejo B que se encuentran contenidos en los cereales y las legumbres verdes, el germen de trigo y la levadura de cerveza y que se tome conjuntamente con los suplementos vitamínicos diarios. <br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado. <br>  <br>  Fuente(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.remediospopulares.com/caidade" rel="nofollow">http://www.remediospopulares.com/caidade</a>|`|1gMLm1Raaa	si es herencia de familia dificil,tambien puede ser estres, en mi pais guatemala hay una hierba que se llama escubillo si saca pelo, y otra que se llama hiedra que mantiene el pelo ***** y brilloso  eso es lo que te puedo aconsejar|`|e7dfaca796ba7011cce2eb8eaf82dc4daa	LAMENTABLEMENTE NO PODREMOS AYUDARTE MUCHO SOBRE ESE TEMA.

dd24a36c16b572a18f0255e8c88b0277aa	A person who is nearsighted either has eyes that are too long from front to back or the cornea (clear front portion of the eye) is curved too steep.  This causes the image that a person is looking at to land in front of the retina (inner lining of the back of the eye), when it should land directly on it.  A person who is farsighted is just the opposite.  His or her eyes will be either too short from front to back or their corneas are not curved steep enough.  This causes the image to land behind the retina.  Glasses or contacts simply bend the light before it enters the eye so that the image lands right on the retina.|`|MsXDh7M4aa	Well the above is correct but if you want to know how does somebody become near/farsighted its like this. Farsightedness is extremely common in ages past 40. Almost everybody will be farsighted at one point or another and age happens to increase your chances of being farsighted. Nearsightedness or myopia can be caused from herdity or reading small text in bad light and overstraining the eyes. It is seen in all ages. Hope I could help.<br>  Shorty

pjFi1P4maa	This is the question asked by people who are considering dating someone who currently has, or has experienced having herpes. Not surprisingly, this is also the question people with herpes fear most.  <br>  <br>  To learn more about herpes and this subject visit: <a href="http://www.my-herpes-cure.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-herpes-cure.info</a><br>  <br>  Dating can already be a nerve-racking experience without adding further complications. Putting past dating traumas aside, consider how much more stressful it can be should one of the dating parties have herpes. This additional stress is usually the result of a lack of understanding regarding herpes dating. <br>  <br>  A person inflicted with herpes by a former partner will always carry the emotional scar of feeling betrayed by that partner. It can be very difficult for a person who has been betrayed by a former partner, and who now shoulders the burden of both the physical, and social stigma caused by having herpes, to learn to trust again. <br>  <br>  People who now must face the prospect of herpes dating have the added challenge of having to face another individual and inform him, or her regarding their condition. The possibility of rejection is immediate. As difficult as this will be, being honest and upfront with the other person is the only possible option. <br>  <br>  Sadly, most people infected with herpes find it too difficult to deal with the thought of being rejected as a result of their condition. These people, rather than adjust to the facts regarding herpes dating, prefer to remain alone, and isolated in their own world. They feel that it is better to be alone and lonely, than to take any chance of being ridiculed and rejected. <br>  <br>  The misconceptions surrounding herpes dating are a result of most peoples ignorance concerning sexually transmitted diseases. The real risk comes in dating another person who may not be aware that they are inflicted with the disease. Dating someone who admits to having, and managing herpes comes with very little, or no risk. <br>  <br>  Herpes has become all too common in our society. As previously mentioned, the real risk is dating a person with no knowledge that they have the disease. This means that a person may already have experienced an intimate relationship with someone who may be infected. This is a risk every first time dating couple has to face when starting a new relationship. <br>  <br>  Herpes dating introduces honesty in the relationship from the very beginning. Is this honesty a handicap? Not at all! Any good relationship is based on honesty, acceptance, and trust. The infected person, by being upfront with their condition, should assure their partner that they will never be put in a vulnerable, or compromising position. A couple mutually managing their relationship, and this condition, can eliminate most if not all of the risks associated with herpes dating. <br>  <br>  Honest and open communication between both parties, right from the beginning, is all that is necessary to make herpes dating successful.|`|AA10820563	99 percent of the time it is through no fault of their own.  As long as you understand the risks and use protection, it is ultimately your decision.  I work in the medical field, and trust me when I tell you that Herpes is more common than most people would EVER believe.|`|YV48WX54aa	I would say no it is not a deal breaker. if you love the person, go for it just protect yourself. be glad that they were hones twith you and do everthing you can to prevent yourself from getting it. dont have sex during outbreaks at all, not that the other person would want to. use condoms, make sure they take their meds as directed and you will be fine. people with herpes live normal lives and have normal sex lives, they just have to take extra precautions. people freak out when they hear the word herpes, but its not a deal breaker, just a sign to be careful and safe,l which someone should do anyway.|`|c61e78b56fe81c5d313b6a174723c1a1aa	For me, it would be a dealbreaker. I would also assume no one tries to get it, so fault giving  is shared. "I Fell IN Lust", one-night stands,putting oneself in  places conducive to being unseen by others, may be hard to avoid. Communication  is a priority. It  takes  'time' to know someone , but today the conversation should begin with "my last HIV test was negative, I do or don't have  Herpes, or STD's, plus". If you're smart enough to know about condoms etc. you will be MAKING your choice . And it is your choice!  BUT  educate yourself first.  Cold sores are Herpes virus, and oral sex can spread the virus anywhere you kiss. There  was a doctor who gave up surgery because of the fear of passing plain old Herpes virus  to  patients, surgical gloves or not. I think it is still true, though rare, that you must not kiss a baby's eyes with cold sores, for fear of causing blindness.

The other alternative is to go to the doctor and have them release the blood for you. What can happen if you don't do it yourself or have the doctor do it is that your nail can fall off. Since the blood has no where to go it builds up pressure and then the nail just comes off. It is very pain full and can mess up your toenail.|`|l5axO0ncaa	paint up your toes with some nail polish. putting a hot pin through it will not only hurt, but leave you with a hole that is equally as unattractive.

jOu7WtR8aa	If you're serious about employment, avoid AFAA. Employers don't take them seriously. Your best bets are NSCA, ACE, and ACSM. There's usually a weekend course and/or a test you'll have to take for your certification, and those good certifications will test you on a lot of things you won't have learned in a weekend. Most major cities have testing sites and dates a few times a year. Check with the individual organizations' websites. There may also be continuing education things you'll ahve to do to retain your certification or a recertification process, again depending on who certifies you. So study up and be prepared to pay $300-400 on the test. Good luck.|`|BOJc9cHzaa	I have NASM and NSCA...I did them online after College.  I liked them because I could go at my own pace.

If you want to look good you have to start your lifestyle changes now with exercising more and on a regular basis even if walking is the only thing you can do. You have to also start eating right, healthy foods that are good for your body. Stop eating any fast food, junk food, sugary foods and soda's. I've known several people who has this surgery and they are so excited when the weight comes off. However they think they can go on eating as they did before and it ends up stretching the tummy out again to accommodate. Before you know it you are at your old weight.

There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges Obesity surgery for foreigners in India. They are called the Fly2india4health Consultants.

I have also read that they arrange financing for international patients, as all surgery is not covered by insurance or by the stinking NHS.<br>  <br>  They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. The cost savings are incredible. As a doctor I personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of Healthcare available here is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star. <br>  <br>  My cousin got her Obesity surgery done there and she is more than very happy with the results.

A restrictive operation such as stomach stapling or adjustable gastric banding decreases food intake, usually by decreasing the size of the stomach. A malabsorptive operation such as a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a biliopancreatic diversion restricts food intake and decreases the digestion and absorption of food.

Primero debes quitarle los aretes y después comienzas a aplicar el yodo para que sane correctamente. Cuando la herida ya tenga tejido sano, coloca nuevamente los aretes previamente lavados y si se puede esterilizados (ponerlos en agua hirviendo por 15-20 minutos) y con guantes esteriles sacarlos y colocarlos al bebé, para que no tengan microbios que contaminen la herida que evoluciona bien.

If it is general health care, contact some medical teaching facilities, who may offer discounted or free clinics as you are helping them train their docs (same thing with dentists, chiropractors, massage therapists, etc)...Keep in mind healthcare is NOT carved in stone and you can negotiate your bill with healthcare providers; they may not like to, but they will reduce bill or work out payment plans.  I have been in healthcare management since 1983 and it does happen, it just isn't often talked up.  Also, check with some local insurance carriers in your area; if you cant afoord a traditional plan, they may offer free discount plans.  Every dime adds up.

A very good friend of mine has tried all the injectables; Betaseron, Avonex, and currently on daily Copaxone.  I can honestly tell you that her fatigue is not such a problem anymore since on the Copaxone.  Once you get to see your neurologist, you will likely discuss all the options.  <br>  <br>  When you see this doctor, you'll have to consider the dosing frequency too....the Avonex was only weekly, but it was so harsh on her body; ie: flu-like symptoms and severe headaches.<br>  <br>  The Betaseron dosing is every other day, but just like Avonex it made her sick every other day.<br>  <br>  But ever since taking Copaxone, it doesn't affect her energy level, and she feels TOTALLY symptom-free.  Fatigue has NOT been a problem whatsoever.<br>  <br>  She's also told me that diet is also very important when managing this disease.  Try to avoid processed foods and wheat gluten, and load up on veggies, fruits and lots of water.<br>  <br>  I'm hoping you get all the right answers when you see your doctor.  You DON'T have to succumb to fatigue or hopelessness.  Best of luck to you.|`|5d8c8aba06c17f464583136665db54f5aa	Hi.  I was diagnosed with MS nine years ago.  I was so fatigued in the beginning, I gave up almost all of my activities.  Then about three years ago I participated in an exercise study at the University of Florida.  It was strength training and I was closely followed by a trainer for 16 weeks.  The results were remarkable.  I felt very tired in the beginning but I wasn't pushed too hard.   We gradually increased the weights and reps.  <br>  After the study was over I joined a gym and continued a workout regimen.  Sometimes I only swim, because the heat is terrible.  I eventually added cardio to my routine.  It took time to build up my endurance but it worked.  I found myself having much more energy and I returned to work full-time.  I now participate in so many more activities and I am happier to feel like I have a life again.  <br>  I still get tired but I know that I have to keep the commitment to exercise.  Some people I know can only do a little at a time -- but that's okay.  You do what you can because the benefits are worth it.  I remember in the beginning I couldn't take a walk during the day because the sunlight was so terrible.  My husband and I used to take a walk at 9pm every night.   <br>  Just remember to start out slowly.  By the way, I am on Copaxone.  I have never taken any of the other injections so I can't compare my fatigue levels.  However, I do know that exercise is what turned my life around.  (And probably the empowering feeling of doing something for myself was a big boost as well.)<br>  The University of Florida has published their findings on exercise and MS.  Try googling it to read more about it.<br>  Good luck!|`|fOrAxMmfaa	Stacy, fatigue is definitely a part of MS. The only symptom, I have truly detested! Can someone take you to the MS Specialist? Do you have a good PCP?<br>  <br>  Depression is very common in MS, sounds like an Antidepressant would help you.

We have a group for women on Yahoo - MSWOMEN. The Multiple Sclerosis Society has people w MS who will call you , The National Multiple Sclerosis Society also has people who will talk to you on the phone, I found MSWORLD.ORG to be helpful too. And when you get more mobile, find an MS local group - in fact find it NOW - they may send someone to take you to the meetings.<br>  <br>  You need hope. Get to the specialist to get on the meds.

Girls are done growing when they're 19-20.  <br>  There are no supplements, vitamins, herbs, drugs, foods, drinks, stretches, sports, exercises......and one person asked if hanging from money bars would make him grow......No.<br>  Don't you think if there was something out there that would make people grow---it would be HUGE, WORLDWIDE news?  Of course.

And the EEG and the MRI showing nothing is not uncommon. Many are epileptic and show nothing on these tests.<br>  The good news is that there are many reliable anti-seizure medications. <br>  Your doctor should refer you to a neurologist.

ffyPPdj6aa	Every human is different when it comes to muscle gain.  If you just started working out you did gain muscle.  Based on your cardio routine your legs get a good workout and can't help but get a little bit bigger/stronger.  Your weight lifting also adds a little muscle.  But you will reach a balance where your body won't add more muscle unless you really increase the weight lifting.  Also remember, muscle weight is good.  If it's size your concerned about, just decrease your caloric intake a bit.|`|0f5863d32107f791b64a151479657879aa	well if u take steroids and protein supplements and drink lots of creatin you could probably gain lots of muscle in no time|`|d3584a0e0e34f910da805c96351e9d37aa	You're only going to lose weight if your cardio puts you in your body's "fat burning zone" (65-75%).  You can gain muscle in a month and muscle does weigh more than fat, but there's no way to know really without measuring your body fat percent.  Type "body fat percent calculation" into a search engine and enter the required data.  Or you can do it by measurement- if you are losing inches while strength training, they are mostly fat.  Have someone measure you- bust, waist, hips, thigh, arm... and compare them in a month.|`|rjcV64D2aa	In one month you could have easily gained 2-4 pounds of muscle. I don't think weight is an issue when dieting and exercising, but rather HOW YOU LOOK when you look in the mirror after a month of working out.<br>  <br>  Are you satisfied with how you look compared to one month ago?|`|ce46cc631243408096334a4509da2b2aaa	I am not the most knowledgeable about muscle gain/loss, but I do know more than your avg. Joe.<br>  <br>  Genetics determines how someone is inclined to growing muscle.  Following that it is diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  I am sure you have gained some muscle.  Research has show that regular and through stretching routines can build some mass.<br>  <br>  With the light weight lifting though, I am not sure how much you gained.  Personally, I think it takes a year to gain 5 - 7 pounds of muscle.  With the right diet and training I am sure you can pack on more within a year.  Usually to gain muscle, you need to eat excess calories with the proper weight training otherwise you will just gain fat.<br>  <br>  Look at those competitive heavy/superheavy weight power and olympic lifters.  They eat to maximize strength and mass gains, so they are really not defined compared to bodybuilders since they gain some fat along the way.|`|XMk53TPtaa	Hi Angela,<br>  <br>  I had to do the weight loss yo yo in the Marine Corps every six months because I always gained 10 or 15 pounds while on recruiting duty.

All this body type stuff is a cop-out. <br>  <br>  When the fat is gone, you will see more muscle.
1Jni8X5faa	Well for your height, you are actually slightly underweight. <br>  <br>  <br>  Are you measuring correctly, you wrap the tape measure around the smallest part of the waist.

sDwN4XuIaa	I have been through this one a few times.  The pain on your left side, if it is abotu a week before your period could be your body trying to ovulate.  That is normal wiht ovulation to have cramping a week before hand.  It could be due to stress, and once in a while that is why they say birthcontrol isnt 100 percent effective, we can still ovulate on it.  Bloated is a normal period feeling.  Another htings I have noticed is that with age, my period and body have changed.  I am about to be 25, and I have noticed my periods are a bit different than they used to be and the very in certain things like bloat wieght, water retention, and a few other things.  It is normal to have these, it sounds like it is just a change in your body maybe.  If you are uncomfortable and nervous about it, you may want to schedule a visit with your OBGNY just to make sure it s okay, but it sounds like normal.  Call them and tlak to them, alot of times your ob office has nurses that call and help you with things like this
H4um5yqQaa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Prevention, rather than cure, should always be your first aim!<br>  Firstly, a thorough and correct warm up will help to prepare the muscles and tendons for any activity to come. Without a proper warm up the muscles and tendons will be tight and stiff. There will be limited blood flow to the lower legs, which will result in a lack of oxygen and nutrients for those muscles.<br>  <br>  Secondly, flexible muscles are extremely important in the prevention of most lower leg injuries. When muscles and tendons are flexible and supple, they are able to move and perform without being over stretched. If however, your muscles and tendons are tight and stiff, it is quite easy for those muscles and tendons to be pushed beyond their natural range of movement. To keep your muscles and tendons flexible and supple, it is important to undertake a structured stretching routine.<br>  <br>  And thirdly, strengthening and conditioning the muscles of the lower leg will also help to prevent shin splints. There are a number of specific strengthening exercises you can do for these muscles, but instead of me going into the details here, I have simply found another web site that has already done all the hard work. <br>  <br>  I extracted this info from a great article on Shim Splint the link is: <a href="http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/archives/shin-splints.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/arc...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

UwTttKCxaa	I have also heard that men(I don't know about women)can grow until they're 21 years old.  However, I think that in most cases a guy will not grow past 17 or 18 years old.  I know for a fact that it is possible, because I've known a guy who was under 20, who by the time he was 21 had grown 3 inches.  Like I said earlier though, I don't think it's common.  I'm a guy, and I didn't grow past when I was 15.  (this part is an edit-I just want to add here, it'll mostly depend on wheather or not your pituitary gland is still active-that gland controls growth and if it isn't active than you won't grow anymore.  Ask your doctor or just do a google on it.)  :)|`|SWlxWcUUaa	I think boys grows until 21 years old.

0i7p63tXaa	When you exercise, lactic acid builds up in your muscles, and it causes a burning feeling.  You probably did more than you should have, but its not too harmful.  Take some tylenol if it is really bad.  If is is moderate to mild pain, try stretching (slowly and gently curve your back to stretch out your stomach).  It will go away soon.|`|CLOtMCwSaa	Well check it out I am in the military. We have to do PT Tests, which are push-ups, sit-ups, and a 2 mile run. Normally when we do those tests, we hurt 4 a couple of days afterwards. Then it just goes away. I would suggest just to try and wait it out, do some more curl-ups, in order to help relax your muscles a bit. Hope this helps. |`|3ubuAFOSaa	You just did too many, especially if you don't do curl ups on a daily basis.  because you did so many it's likely to linger for this long, it might be gone partially by tonight or tomorrow.  the only thing you can do is to wait for them to go away (take an advil) i'm afraid.

Stop the frieght train before it goes off the rails. You say you are 5'6, and weigh 110 pounds. Well, I have a pretty simple answer to that: GET OFF YOUR FEET, AND START COMMITING GULLUTENY ABOUT TIMES A DAY! I am 6'0, and not even finished growing, and i weigh, oh, 170. If you do sports, quit, unless the sports give you muscle. Then, you should start bringing large steaks with Hollandaise sauce. That should bring you up to, about 140 in a week, unless you have a tapeworm. Then, just get surgery because then it would be a lost cause.|`|oqQNE5onaa	oo im 14 and about 5'5 and i weigh 105 pounds id say your a bit to skinny|`|qkGUBfi1aa	If you were overweight I'd say it was unhealthy, but seeing as you're underweight, I can't make the same distinction. BMI (Body Mass Index) doesn't indicate health... only what the "norm" is. I, for example, am 5'11" and only weigh 110lbs, but am extremely healthy. This is because my metabolism is so fast it burns calories faster than I can put them in. My best advice is to get a simple checkup and see if the doctor can find anything wrong... most likely you're just one of the lucky ones who can't get fat, hehe!|`|xMeMTq9Jaa	i wouldn't say it's healthy..you should at least be 140-150...the reason i say that is bc my wife is 4'11 and she weighs 113

eWy3bwQdaa	Okay the first step to a happy, motivated future is the hardest.  Once you (and only you can get this done) take the first step, it just gets easier and easier.<br>  Get up at a reasonable hour and start doing that every day.  Go for a walk/run/ some sort of exercise.  Please!  The more you exercise, the more motivated you will feel.  You will feel better on the inside & your confidence in how you look will improve.  <br>  Get into a routine of getting up, going for a walk, having a shower & getting dressed & eating a healthy breakfast.  You will feel so darn good about yourself, the rest of the day will be a breeze.<br>  Clean your house, you wont be able to think clearly in a mess.  You will also feel good about doing it.  It's all about doing things that make you feel good about yourself.  Pats on the back!<br>  Set yourself tasks to do everyday, on top of your morning routine.  If you put things off, you will dance around them all day, the guilt will return & the motivation will cease.<br>  Once you've returned to a functional life, you will feel better & more confident in yourself to go out & find work.  Get out and about, meet friends for coffee, it's not what you know sometimes, it's who.  Who knows, that uncle of a friend might be looking for someone just like you to fill a position.<br>  Cheer up, & give yourself the hand up you deserve.|`|h4hXvagDaa	You need to sort out the mess in ur house first. It really does help if you break it up in2 small tasks like emptying the bins, doing the dishes and tidying up a bit at a time. Naive as it sounds, make a checklist of small tasks and tick them off as you get them done. Reward urself with coffee breaks etc as you go. The idea is to give you a sense of achievement and confidence. Get out and visit or invite a close friend to talk to. This gives you an external perspective of your real value, rather than the negative and pessimistic feeling you may have about yourself. If you cannot identify a definitive reason for your lassitude and despair (like relationship problems), it may be you have depression. This is exactly like flu or a broken leg except you don't sneeze or limp- it can be just as debilitating and you should not hesitate to seek medical advice. You have already taken the first step in sorting out your life in admitting the problem..good luck!|`|34L8XKhMaa	I wish I could tell you how, but I can't because my life is exactly that way, though I will tell that I have made enormous progress, to the point that I am seeing career counselors to help me with my resume and apply for work. <br>  <br>  The steps I took are as follows,<br>  -I went to an employment agency<br>  -Explained my situation<br>  -Asked them what sort of facilities they have<br>  -Told them I was looking to get some counseling <br>  -Got referral<br>  -The rest is history i am still working on my life<br>  If you can't do that , you could try this, which is advised to me by my current therapist because my sessions with her are over<br>  - Talk to  family doctor<br>  -Got referral to a psychiatrist<br>  (explain what you want)<br>  -Get referral to Counselor<br>  <br>  From all this "bs" in my life , one thing i realized is I have to ask for what I want.  I hope you do too , and in real life not just on the internet. It's very difficult , I've had months where I couldn't manage to leave my apartment. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  p.s : here's something my therapist tells me :"there are no magic wands which make everything the way we want" which leads me to understand that I have to make them happen my self by trying|`|l74RoxUDaa	Ouch!  Join the club.  I am in almost the same predicament as you, and most of the advice above is good.<br>  <br>  Because I am a middle-aged man, I no longer have the heart to do job applications - they get thrown out as long as there is a woman who wants the job, but at least I have a casual part-time driving job to keep the wolf's teeth from the door.<br>  <br>  But the mess.  This is the bane of my life.  Every day I get up at 6 or 7 sometimes determined to break into the housework, and get side-tracked by Yahoo Answers, which is becoming an addiction.<br>  <br>  I tried a hypnotherapist, but she said in effect I was a loony and needed to see a shrink.  My sister (the one with the gushing sympathy of a dalek, but who is kind in a practical no-nonsense way) has told me she is coming down at the start of August to spend a day cleaning.  Somehow I have to get the house tidy at least by then.  Nearly always there is a mad panic a few hours before, when I can get a whole room done in that lunatic time, and my sister arrives with me juggling Henry the Cleaner, carrier bags, old receipts, bank statements, junk mail, half-started projects and on and on with hair bedraggled and dust everywhere.  A lot gets done, but not nearly enough.<br>  <br>  Maybe therein lies the solution.  A stream of visitors at regular intervals, so that with each panic, a little more of the demon is chipped away.  Make a list and invite them over weekly, starting with the most tolerant, and working towards the fussiest as a final challenge (it may take 15 years or more to get it fit for the Queen!). <br>  <br>  When the place is tidy, then there is facing the demoralisation of these damned job applications and having to face bare-faced prejudice with every one.  You have to suffer these in order to claim the dole, but you have to be strong enough not to bring you down completely.  When I was well enough, I worked on a two week cycle of fed-upness.  One week I was sick to the teeth of tweaking my failures on forms to those who used those forms specifically to exclude people like me.  All I'd do then is to highlight any jobs that looked interesting or possible and no more.  Put them away.  The next week, I was sick of my own company and being stuck in the house and knew the only way out was these damned forms, so I'd work down the highlighted jobs and buzz off cvs with, preferably, as little thought or hope than was necessary.<br>  <br>  Probably the best advice is to eat properly.  Don't ever follow the advice of those stupid people who say lunch is only for wimps.  For us, lunch is survival!|`|vkbQkiAWaa	First thing is tidy up your house. spend a whole day cleaning. I guarantee you will feel better and be able to think clearer. Do not even think of looking for a job until this is done. Remember the karate kid? He went around cleaning before he learned to fight. Its kinda like that. Its about restoring order to your life. The next day get your cv in order. Get a friend to lend you theirs if you havent one made up already and change the details to your own. Take your time until you are fully satisfied. Also write a cover letter. Its just a short note explaining why you want to work for the employer. very important if you want to stand out. Then when thats done simply go to an online job site, jobs.uk or whatever and email to as many openings as you like you have nothing to lose and all to gain. Then when thats done, relax with a few drinks and wait for replies.|`|pVCB6Ndsaa	If its in the UK, you should try 4 communications, they have job opportunities there , unless its here in the states, you can inquire from venus inter venture Ltd. they'll help put you in the right place, here is there direct email link (crag_marks@yahoo.com) they are also affiliated to webropeloans both here in the states, London and in the UK.<br>  goodluck<br>  From Angelina B.|`|XccyvrjPaa	I know what you're going through..and I really think you gotta give up that laziness and get yourself a job.

Wierd yes, I stay myself... it just motivates me.  <br>  i see her beautiful clean house... and i like it... so i go about it the way she does or i think she would<br>  <br>  Anyways... good luck ;-)<br>  <br>  Also you can imagine ppl are going to be over... <br>  clean up the house... <br>  get fixed up yourself...<br>  better yet, invite them over and make urself do it!<br>  ha...then get to talking about work and money....it it may push you over the edddge to get out there yourself

Otros síntomas de la migra?a a menudo incluyen náuseas y vómitos, distorsión de la visión, vértigo e hipersensibilidad a la luz. Una migra?a clásica es precedida por un aura en la cual la persona ve luces intermitentes, formas y colores distorsionados y otras ilusiones ópticas. Esto se conoce como el síndrome de Alicia en el País de las Maravillas, porque se parece a las experiencias descritas por Lewis Carroll, quién sufría de migra?a.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  DESCRIPCIóN<br>  <br>  La migra?a clásica comienza con un aura que dura de 10 a 30 minutos antes de empezar el dolor. Durante el ataque, el aura desaparece y el dolor se hace más intenso y palpitante. El dolor ataca un solo lado de la cabeza. A veces el vomitar alivia el ataque. Una migra?a puede durar desde unos 30 minutos a 5 días o más.<br>   <br>  <br>  Normalmente el dolor de migra?a afecta a un solo lado de la cabeza.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  CONSIDERACIONES<br>  <br>  La mayoría de los dolores de cabeza no son serios y se curan solos. Sin embargo, frecuentes migra?as pueden reducir la calidad de vida. Aunque se desconoce el motivo, estudios recientes indican que quienes las sufren tienen más riesgo de infarto.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  CAUSAS<br>  <br>  Se cree que el dolor proviene de:<br>  <br>      * La inflamación o irritación de los vasos sanguíneos del cuero cabelludo (éstos, primero se contraen y luego se dilatan, lo cual produce inflamación y dolor palpitante, donde quizás las prostaglandinas sustancias parecidas a hormonas intervengan).<br>      * Las hormonas son también un factor. Así el 70 por ciento de los enfermos son mujeres y se sabe que los cambios de los niveles hormonas durante la menstruación y ovulación provocan, a menudo, ataques.<br>  <br>  Algunos factores ambientales provocan migra?as en personas propensas, entre ellos los más comunes son:<br>  <br>      * Ciertos alimentos o aditivos: quesos crudos, hígado de aves, chocolate, vino tinto, glutamato monosódico y conservadores que se encuentran en los productos ahumados y carnes en conserva.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Tras la vasoconstricción (estrechamiento de los vasos), éstos se expanden causando inflamación y dolor palpitante<br>  <br>  <br>  También afectan otros estímulos:<br>  <br>      * Cambios en la presión atmosférica.<br>      * Cambios en la altitud<br>      * El resplandor solar<br>      * El estrés y otros factores emocionales.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  SIGNOS Y SíNTOMAS<br>  <br>  Los síntomas más frecuentes son:<br>  <br>      * Dolor de cabeza fuerte y palpitante, normalmente limitado a un solo lado.<br>      * Distorsiones visuales y otros síntomas precediendo al dolor.<br>      * Náuseas, vómitos, vértigo, manos frías, temblores o sensibilidad a la luz y al sonido.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  LLAMANDO AL MéDICO<br>  <br>  Cuando los dolores de cabeza son graves y recurrentes, no aliviándose con aspirina, requieren consultar al doctor.<br>  éste realiza el diagnóstico basándose en los<br>   <br>  <br>  síntomas y en la revisión de la historia clínica familiar.<br>  Los rayos X y otros estudios pueden ayudar a descartar un tumor.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  TRATAMIENTO<br>  <br>  Los especialistas en dolor de cabeza han descubierto que una migra?a puede desaparecer si se actúa con rapidez durante la etapa de aura.<br>  <br>      * Una estrategia común es tomar aspirina con café u otra fuente de cafeína. La aspirina inhibe la producción de prostaglandina y la cafeína combate los vasculares.<br>      * Otra manera es recostarse a oscuras con una compresa fría en la frente. En casos leves esto puede prevenir la dilatación de<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  los vasos del cuero cabelludo y parar o minimizar el ataque.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Si sufre ataques frecuentes consulte a su doctor para que le recete alguna medicación preventiva, por ejemplo:<br>  <br>      * Beta bloqueadores<br>      * Ergotamina.<br>  <br>  También puede probar procedimientos alternativos tales como técnicas de autorrelajación.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|QsrX5CY3aa	I used desert burn hoodia and lost 33 pounds and have kept it off for over 3 years now.

If you aren't gaining muscle, then chances are you aren't doing one or both of these.  <br>  FYI, light workouts generally do not build muscle.  You will need to train hard but train infrequently.  Add to this a substantial amount of nutritious food, every day.  Then you'll see results.  Speak to a licensed nutritionist and a certified trainer about an appropriate program for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are no magic pills for gaining muscle.  Sorry.  And supplements will only *help* if you have already gained a substantial amount of muscle AND you are already eating enough and training properly.

R0mGeGczaa	Lipozene contains glucomannan that acts similarly to a fiber supplement. Glucomannan is not overly effective for promoting weight loss and is rather expensive for what it is. Check out a review and customer report of lipozene here <a href="http://www.diet-pills.cc/lipozene.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diet-pills.cc/lipozene.html</a>
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever.

Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

DBG4xLZ2aa	Once you'll have less worries it will reduce your depression. I have a long experience with worries and a short one with depression. The tips I can give you about worries:<br>  One of the reasons you feel worried all the times is because you are worried that you will worry. And that start a vicious cycle- that keep bringing you more worries. The same thing goes with panic and anxiety- there is fear that give you more of the things you don't want.<br>  Don't fight your worries (getting angry won't help you, you don't choose your thoughts- only how you react to them) and don't be afraid from them (there are not your boss).<br>  Ask yourself in a true and confident voice- what I have to worry about? can I do something about it? and act accordingly<br>  Keep in mind you can't control everything- this is one of the main reasons you keep on worrying. Bear in mind that 99.9999% of the things that sustain you on this planet aren't on your control (you don't stay up every night and help the sun rise in the morning)|`|LXyxS1hTaa	You need to call a hot line. People can talk to you about this and give you tips. I'm going to get my psych degree soon. Usually people who are depressed do suffer eating issues so that's probably it. But people who don't eat are trying to control their lives. You probably feel you're life is not in control. Try writing in a journal and channeling your thoughts. Working out can elevate your mood and keep you from gaining weight. As long as you eat healthy you will be fine. BUT YOU MUST EAT. Not eating can make your mood change as well, you become lethargic and cranky.|`|Bx29lQF3aa	Your perfect just the way you are.

You need to make note when is your vision worsen is it before you take metformin after or is it all the time, that is how you can determine if metformin really affects your vision.<br>  <br>  Beside that you need to check your vision at least once a year.

Make sure you are doing your diet right and exercising. You probably should ask an endocrinologist if it keeps happening.|`|EaeEVGZyaa	Diabetes can affect your vision. Have you seen an opthalmologist who treats diabetic patients?  You should pursue this vigorously. Some diabetics lose their vision.  You don't want to part of that group. Good luck.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Insulin Resistance is Diabetes type 2. Are you checking your glucose levels 4 times a day? First thing in the morning, before lunch, before dinner and at bedtime? Have you switched to a very low carbohydrate food plan?<br>  <br>  How do you know the Metformin is doing great things if you are not aware of your glucose levels all the time?<br>  <br>  High glucose levels will affect the eyesight on the bad side of things. Keeping your glucose numbers between 80 and 115 will improve your eyes a lot.<br>  <br>  I haven't heard of anyone having eyesight problems on metformin unless they need more medication. And since Type 2 Diabetes is a progressive disease or condition and progresses at its own speed no matter what we do to try to control our glucose levels, you may need to go see the doctor again.<br>  <br>  Anyone taking any AntiDiabetic medication like Metformin should be seeing the doctor on a regular every 3 months basis, not once a year or once every 5 years.
TEE4sJscaa	As a veteran and a female I am going to tell you that starving yourself is the absolute worse thing that you can do to your body. It may look like your losing fat but you are not. You are really losing everything but the fat. You will be so drained of energy that you will sleep more and more. This effort that you think will come out of it, will amount to nothing, you will only gain more weight this way. You may not want to hear this but the easiest way to lose unwanted pounds is not only exersize, eat right but also to drink WATER. ( at least 2 liters of water a day,but not all at once) Remember you are only 13 and you have more growth spurts to go through. There are many other exersizes out there other than just using gym equipment. You don't have to go to a gym to get fit, you can do it at home too. |`|DH6b6coXaa	what kind of answer are you looking for? are you here for us to tell you to starve bc you said no diets and no "go to the gym" soooo what does that leave us with? sounds like you made up your mind already and just want to be justified. it is stupid to starve yourself. yeah, i suppose ruining your body and being sad the whole time would be worth it, bc if you are sad and the smaller you get you still dont see how thin you are and then you wear baggy clothes to cover up  your skinny....then what is the point of being skinny? you know what to do. eat balanced meals and exercise. that is all there is to it. your choice. |`|p6A7Fprfaa	Your not fat.

You can't starve yourself because your body will hold onto fat and burn muscle for energy then you will look like a blob. My only advise within your guidelines is to eat healthy (high fibre, high protein, low fat foods) no junk food or pop, when you take P.E. at school work extra hard so that you are getting a workout, maybe join a sports team to get some additional exercise. Drink lots of water and green tea.|`|M1Rrir5Faa	try limiting your calorie intake (even just cutting back 300 calories can make you lose 3 pounds a month). if you really want to know, you should go to the doctor and have them give you a BMI. try running laps around your house for ten minutes, gradually increasing the time you run. you're either on the heavier side of healthy or just a few pounds overweight. it's not necessarily a "bad" thing. starving leads to binging, which leads to eating disorders and depression. so, no, you should not do that. please, be safe. and screw what the bastard tells you, he's obviously trying to take some internal problem he has out on you. why would you seek to conform to that which your enemy instructs of you?

AA12042874	Changing depends on the person and if you're on day one or about to end (heavy or light). On average when heavy, maybe every 3 hours or so. Basically, when it looks like there's a lot of blood on the pad, change it. The only disadvantage to changing too often is it spending more on pads lol. <br>  It's also a good thing to always have a pad in your purse or backpack just in case it does start in school or the store. If you think it has, then just ask the teacher if you can use the bathroom; they shouldn't have a problem since they know that girls are going through that at this time. <br>  If you cannot get to the bathroom in time though, it usually won't bleed so much where it will get all over your pants and people will notice. However, if you are nervous about that happening, try wearing darker pants and/or have a hoodie with you so you can tie it around your waste and 'hide' that area. <br>  <br>  Also, another good suggestion is when you start, mark the dates down on a calender so you have an idea when you'll start your next one. The first year or so things will be off balance, but after a while, you'll get the swing of it and it will stick to the schedule a bit more.<br>  <br>  Good luck    |`|xp8zB9Bkaa	It varies on how often to change pads depending on how heavy your flow is.  Typically, you should change every 3-4 hours just for the sake of hygiene, regardless of how full (or not) your pad is.  This helps reduce odor and bacterial growth.  If it gets full before then, then change as often as you need to feel comfortable.  <br>  In school, if you start your period in class, most likely you won't bleed that much at first, but if you feel something, ask to use the restroom and always have a pad in your bookbag or purse, just in case.|`|baqUfLAYaa	You change your pad every few hours, or as necessary. If you get it in class, just ask to use the restroom. if this was your first time and you got it in class, it will most likely not bleed through because it will probably be pretty light. and after your first period you will know how heavy it is so next time if it happens during class you will know if it is necessary to go to the restroom. But don't forget your heaviness will not always be the same. Good luck and hope this helped (: |`|NEXWW6luaa	i would talk to your mom<br>  or some other trusted adult<br>  i change my pads or tampons quite often<br>  just to stay fresh and clean<br>  and usually i am wearing a pad<br>  or a pantie liner when i'm getting close<br>  just to make sure nothing leaks<br>  but of course you should get up <br>  and go to a restroom if you have <br>  nothing on lol don't bleed on yourself|`|cvi65fLIaa	Ok so, if ur in school and u know that u get it jsut say that u need to use the restroom........teacher HAVE to let u go. if they don't, say that u feel sick and u have to go to the nurse. if have pads with u (u should if u think ur going to get it) then use one, or go to the nurse. the nurse alwasy has them on stock and ready for use. also, if it is ur first period, it should be/might be pretty light so it realy won't bleed everywhere. If u have no way to get to a pad, fold a wad of toilet paper rerally thickly and use it instead for the meantime. Or if ur wearing a sock, u could use that because it is very absorbant. <br>  <br>  When u start wearing pads, u defintily need to change it if it completely full. u will know if teh blood is taking up a big 'circle" of space. Usually, this will occur between 4-6 hours.  u shouldn't leave a pad in for more than 6 hours, even if it isn't full. if u have to change it afte 2 hourse because it if full, i would try getting a more absorbant/higher level pad.<br>  hope i helped!|`|E5GyPYt7aa	change i when ever its making you feel uncomfortable and wet. and if you get it in class go to the bathroom and put on a pad if you don't have one use toilet paper for the time it probably wont leak through the first time but still you don't want a big red stain on your pants.|`|9fkBfu6qaa	It depends on the day. On you're first day, you may have to change every 3-4 hours. By the end of your period, a pad can last all day.|`|2Pugmaqwaa	well it depends if you get a lite or heavy flow but if you have a lite flow then every day but if you if you get a heavy flow then more than once a day|`|JqKYNwd1aa	I change my pads every 3 hours or so just to stay fresh and if you get it in class you go to the bathroom and put a pad on.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|m7putYGmaa	it depends, usually you should change your pad every few hours, but it all comes down to how much blood you have<br>  <br>  if you have a very light flow, which is most likely for your first period, you may only need to change it once or twice, because so little blood is coming out<br>  <br>  if you have a LOT of blood, then obviously you need to change it more often<br>  <br>  you never want to feel like youre sitting in a puddle<br>  <br>  if you need to change it in school, just ask to go to the bathroom, if they say no then just look at them seriously and say "i NEED to go, its an emergency"<br>  <br>  the teacher will probably get the idea<br>  <br>  sometimes it will feel like your bleeding everywhere but you're really not, blood wont go EVERYWHERE but if you dont change a saturated pad, some blood may get on your underwear|`|BRDqfAy3aa	If you would change pads every 3-4 hours - no problem - read below about puberty and breast development, when expect first period and menstrual products

But, sometimes a close friend can help you decide if you're making a hasty or idiotic decision about a potential mate. <br>  <br>  I always say: 1.Choose wisely and 2. Treat kindly. Relationships aren't any more complex than that. If you break either rule, however, all bets are off and it gets VERY complex.

Crunches twice a week may not be enough for you to build muscle at any great speed.below given some tips-<br>  1. Shed bodyfat-In order to really 'see' your abs you'll need to get your overall bodyfat levels down to about 13-14% (for women).the most effective - and fastest way - to shed bodyfat is to eat a very 'clean' diet, strength train at least 3 times per week, and perform some type of cardio at least 4 times per week<br>  2. Build strong abs-But, since you want to learn how to get a six pack fast, you should probably be performing a good amount of ab-specific exercise. Forget about useless movements that target upper abs, lower abs, inner abs, outer abs, etc. You really only need to do 3 movements to work your entire ab region:<br>      * Bicycle Maneuver<br>      * Reverse Crunch<br>      * The Plank <br>  Of course normal crunches are great too but the bicycle maneuver incorporates the basic crunch movement and recruits even more abdominal muscles<br>  <br>  |`|NxtM0I4eaa	Six pack abs are very easily obtained, and not to mention they look great on men and women. the best way to obtain them is through diet and exercise. doo sit ups, crunches, and leg lifts to build and tone abs. thats the easy part, the hard part is that though your may have well developed abs you won't see them untill your body fat percentage is below 10 % which is difficult for females to achive because they have a naturally higher body fat percentage than men. also if you are self concious about your breast size this may not be the best idea for you because breats are comprised of fatty tissue cells, and if you get your body fat down your breast size may go with it. So now you have the basic knowledge, decide if it's for you and go for it. you can contact me if you have any other questions|`|226YmM3Gaa	Check out this review of the truth about abs<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.best-weight-loss-and-fitness-programs.com/truth-about-abs-review" rel="nofollow">http://www.best-weight-loss-and-fitness-...</a><br>  <br>  You may find it's what your looking for, the pack contains specific exercises and nutritional information that are targeted at strengthening and toning your abdominal area.<br>  <br>  Women can get abs just the same way men can, i don't think there is much difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck

W5CNpm47aa	At 120 pounds, you need to consume approx. 1200 calories per day to just maintain your body weight.  Eating drastically less than that will cause your body to fail.  <br>  <br>  Based on your other questions from the past couple of months, your body is in a severe food deprivation mode.  It is trying to keep all the weight it can.  You are losing muscle mass instead of fat.  Lose muscle mass, lose your body balance.  Your body will fail.  <br>  <br>  You need help, please seek some professional help.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question,  you can't lose weight at that rate.<br>  <br>  A pound of fat is roughly equal to 3500 calories.   You need to eat 3500 calories to lose a pound.  <br>  <br>  With what you eat, this is not possible.

H4um5yqQaa	Yes you can most certainly recover from a groin injury. You must fully complete the rehabilitation program set in place in order for this to happen. That is why you see so many people re-injuring themselves as they don't fully take the time to recover.<br>  <br>  Recovery takes time and today's society is time deprived. A combination of stretching, heating and exercising are a few ways to recover.<br>  <br>  There is a great site on stretching and sports injury that talks specifically about rehabilitation. Check out this link for more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/archives/active-rehabilitation.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/arc...</a><br>  <br>  Also, if you want more info on groin injuries check out this comprehensive article from the same site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/archives/groin-pain.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/arc...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question!
38884d349b9481e2cc08f324197bca7aaa	I would recommend cutting cereal out of your diet period, with the exception of whole wheat cereals like Shredded Wheat.  The fast digestive and sugar coated carbs run right through your system and do nothing for you.. I took a nutrition class and my teacher said you could basically get as much nutritional value from eating the box it came in.. As far as your timing, I would get to bed earlier, try to wake up by at least 8 or 9am, waking and getting to bed too late puts your circadian clock out of whack and you won't be able to recuperate effectively.  Anyway, if waking up earlier isn't an option I would drink a malt, the amount would be dependent on your body size.. Say if your 6ft 180 pounds, I'd mix 3 cups of skim milk, 1 cup of low fat ice cream(your favorite flavor of course), and a scoop of protein powder, this will give you the carbs, protein, and calories you need to fuel yourself for the the day.  However, you can't simply live off of supplements and shakes, so I would eat a bowl of oatmeal, and a stick of string cheese along with the shake..  The shake will supply you with the things I said, but it will also act as a carrier for the nutrients of the oatmeal and cheese..  Something else you could try is preparing egg and tuna salad, which is very convenient if you don't have the time for an intricate meal.  Just prepare the egg or tuna salad, enough for the week, so in the morning all you have to do is grab four slices of bread, slap the salad between it, grab a liter of milk and off you go.  All of your food groups and needs are present with this grab and go meal.  The shake, eggs and oatmeal would be a more desirable substitute, but if you have to grab and go, the egg or tuna salad is what I'd recommend..|`|FqMOyY8vaa	It's relatively good for you. The reason people eat after they wake up is because of one of two things:<br>  1. It gets your metabolism started for the day. If you are trying to lose weight it is always wise eat breakfast (or in your case lunch). If you exercise immediately after you get up and haven't eaten anything first your body will have a tendency to burn muscle instead of fat.<br>  2. It gives you energy for the start of your day. When I was in high school they always advised us to eat breakfast before a major test because it helped with concentration (the brain is more alert and you aren't constantly bothered by how hungry you are). <br>  Typically cereal is the best thing to have after you've gotten up because it is composed of starches and will last throughout your morning (or afternoon) activities.

MWpA1FWYaa	Pues yo creo que deberías empezar a caminar y comer fruta a mitad de la ma?ana y la tarde, para que así estés más llena y puedas elegir tu almuerzo con más conciencia dietética.

Durante los primeros 14 días no se podrá comer pan, pastas, papa, arroz, frutas, caramelos, postres, tortas, galletas o azúcares refinadas. Tampoco se permiten bebidas alcohólicas.<br>  <br>  ? Fase II: Introducción de carbohidratos beneficiosos<br>  Después de las primeras 2 semanas se habrán perdido entre 4 y 6 kilos, especialmente de grasa abdominal, pero lo más importante es el cambio interno. La ansiedad disminuirá drásticamente y la persona se sentirá mejor.<br>  Después de los 14 días se puede seguir perdiendo peso. Se podrán introducir pastas, arroz, pan, arepas, frutas y hasta chocolates. Una vez alcanzada la meta, se pasa a una fase más liberal del programa, la cual ayuda a mantener el peso alcanzado de por vida.<br>  <br>  ? Fase III: Alimentación correcta de por vida<br>  Cuando se alcanza esta fase, más que una estrategia dietética, se trata de una forma de vida.<br>  Si ocurre algún aumento de peso en la fase III simplemente se regresa a la fase II o I por 14 días.<br>  <br>  Primera fase<br>  Esta fase es referida como un periodo de desintoxificación. Si el peso inicial es alto se pueden perder hasta 13 libras en dos semanas. La primera fase es muy estricta pero dura solamente dos semanas. Durante esta fase se pierde mas peso que en el resto de la dieta y es una introducción a la segunda fase.<br>  <br>  Durante esta fase se comen porciones generosas de proteínas, vegetales, grasas saludables y carbohidratos con bajo índice glicérico. El índice glicérico les da valores a los alimentos dependiendo como afectan la glucosa en la sangre, evalúa fundamentalmente los carbohidratos.<br>  <br>  La idea es que durante esta fase las personas rompen el circulo vicioso de los carbohidratos malos y dejan de sentir los deseos intensos por alimentos como pan, azúcar y repostería. Después de esta fase es más fácil continuar en la dieta South Beach Diet.<br>  <br>  Segunda Fase<br>  Durante esta fase se pierde peso a niveles normales de 1 a 2 libras a la semana. Es una fase mas flexible que la primera y relativamente fácil de seguir.<br>  <br>  Esta es la fase donde los carbohidratos buenos son nuevamente incluidos en la dieta. Los carbohidratos buenos incluyen: frutas, panes hechos con harinas enteras, pasta de harina entera, arroz entero (brown, café) y otros similares.<br>  <br>  Esta fase se continua hasta que se adelgaza o alcanza el peso deseado. Los carbohidratos son incluidos poco a poco, se empieza con una fruta al día y poco a poco se come cereal y pan entero.<br>  <br>  Durante esta fase es importante poner atención a las alimentos que te hacen comer más. Todos somos susceptibles a algunos alimentos mas que a otros. Para algunas personas son las tortillas o el pan para otras es el dulce. Esto funciona como los alcohólicos con el alcohol para algunas personas es imposible parar cuando prueban algunos alimentos.

El café es un estimulante poderoso. Contiene cafeína, que es un competidor de la adrenalina. La adrenalina, como es conocido, es la hormona que se libera en casos de estrés, cuando el organismo necesita responder con rapidez.<br>  <br>  La cafeína actúa igual que la adrenalina, sólo que es más potente y duradera, y va reemplazando a la adrenalina que normalmente existe en la sangre.<br>  <br>  Las personas que toman café en exceso van manifestando diversos tipos de molestias, dependiendo del tiempo que lleven de consumo y de cómo su propio organismo se va acostumbrando:<br>  <br>  Temblor leve en las manos, mal dormir (les cuesta conciliar el sue?o, su sue?o se hace muy "liviano", tienen pesadillas, se despiertan fácilmente y no pueden volver a quedarse dormidas), palpitaciones cardíacas (sensación de que el corazón se les va a salir), taquicardia de reposo (más de 100 latidos por minuto estando en reposo); boca seca, aumento de las veces en que orina al día, agresividad. Con el tiempo, pueden volverse adictas al café, y sentirse muy mal cuando no pueden tomarlo.<br>  <br>  Actualmente existen muchos tipos de café. Mientras más puro, más natural, los efectos de la cafeína son más atenuados. También existe un efecto de la dilución a la que se toma, y de la cantidad. En países como Brasil, que se toma mucho café, habitualmente se hace en cantidades muy peque?as varias veces al día. Se conoce como "tinto", es café de grano, y no se detectado da?o debido a esta forma de beberlo. En países como Chile, en que el café de buena calidad es caro y no hay costumbre de prepararlo (molerlo, filtrarlo y mantenerlo caliente), la gente por lo general prefiere cafés instantáneos, que son de baja calidad y altamente adictivos.<br>  <br>  Hay países como el Paraguay y varias zonas de Argentina, en el que el consumo del café es prácticamente nulo, siendo reemplazado por el uso del mate.<br>  <br>  Por último te cuento que la cafeína es una hormona que está presente en varios alimentos y bebidas, en distintas concentraciones y formas: Además del café, el té, el té verde, el mate, el chocolate y el boldo. Otras sustancias similares a la cafeína las encuentras en las bebidas gaseosas estimulantes y en los antigripales, en los que la sustancia se llama "efedrina" o "pseudoefedrina". Sus efectos son similares a los de la cafeína, y sirven para paliar los síntomas de los resfríos. <br>  <br>  Por eso, tomarse un buen café sin leche, oloroso y con pausa, es una buena manera de pasar un buen rato cuando nos acosan los molestos resfríos. Por lo tanto, el café en sí no es malo. El exceso de café, como el exceso de cualquier cosa, sí que lo es. Pero de a poco, el café es muy sano.<br>  <br>  ?Salud!|`|iKNg0C0Baa	Puede sufrir trastornos nerviosos,imsonnio y a la larga un problema grave de hipertensión.|`|sKYtCb7maa	todo lo que se come o se bebe sin moderacion es perjudicial para la salud, en el caso del cafe es una bebida que no se elimina del cuerpo hasta las seis u ocho horas de consumirlo, el cafe produce nerviosismo y tambien problemas de hipertension y estomacales, por eso te recomiendo que no abuses de el, un par de tazas es bueno pero no mas, porque el cafe con moderacion tambien ayuda a otros problemas de salud.

Toning is important, but first you need to build up the muscle so that it's visible. To build the size of a muscle you do Strength training rather than endurance training.

Gum, popcorn, chew some ice, go crazy...then brush very very hard.<br>  <br>  Then, you should get separators (little things in the back of your teeth to prepare you for braces).  In this time: Get ready for some pain.  It'll feel like you have a piece of meat in between your teeth that won't come out.  It's okay if you take some Advil, though.<br>  <br>  After your braces: You'll want to eat soft foods for a few days.  If your teeth still hurt badly after about 3ish days, eat a steak.  I know this sounds crazy.  My mom made me do it, and it hurt like crazy.  The next day, though, my teeth felt better than they had in days!<br>  <br>  After a while you'll probably be a bad person and begin eating popcorn and chewing gum again.  It's okay, though, most of us do it.  And after about a week they begin to feel normal.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and you'll probably find that after you get your colors changed a few times that it never matches your clothes.  I would recommend the clear color if you don't eat too much mustard.|`|FHobffifaa	be sure to have your parents make custard and soups for you.

Dont schedule anything for the next two or three days. Good luck!|`|Ak8I0Q0Eaa	Chew as much bubblegum as you can before you get your braces.

8Nc7WEYAaa	Krystal~~<br>  <br>  Please do not get into bulimia...my roommate did this and ended up with a lot of healthy problems from it.  If you want to shake your system into losing more then do what my son does and I have always done and use Atkins diet.  You will be getting all sugar and carbs out of yours system the first two weeks and some people find it hard to restrict their diets during this time, or are weak for a few days cuz of getting sugar gone, but you certainly seem determined if you are restricting your calories as in other posts from you and this is way better than vomiting....I will give you a website with all the rules to get you started, and if you have any problems feel free to email me for help.  My son lost 50 pounds (he is now 25 yrs old) and I lost 35 and am still 5"5" and 112 so it works.  The only exercise either of us does is walking....love to walk 45 -60 minutes every other day and my son sometimes bicycles but has not done this for about 4 months.  The advantage of this way of eating low carbs is after 1-2 weeks you are never hungry.  You do not have to worry about calories but while on the first phase you will be restricted in foods.  So check here for all info and questions and if you want to join the forum to talk to peeps and get help it is free.  Good luck and please don't vomit anymore.  ox<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.atkinsdietbulletinboard.com/forums/atkins-low-carb-dieting-faqs/6681-read-first-how-navigate-forum.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atkinsdietbulletinboard.com/f...</a><br>  <br>  Forums <a href="http://www.atkinsdietbulletinboard.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://www.atkinsdietbulletinboard.com/f...</a>|`|9SYzeD0maa	Your stomach acid burns away the lining to your esophagus, your teeth will also begin to rot and deteriorate after a while. You will have no energy, and your body will go into starvation induced ketosis in which its burning ketones derived form already burned fat enzymes.

h4N4ZiGcaa	I feel really skeptical about the "then add a bunch of stuff to it." But if you are really self-conscious about your height, I guess it could be worth a try. I am also a short person (male senior in high school, only 5'3"!!) and I think I might give it a try if I had the opportunity.<br>  <br>  Things to consider:<br>  <br>  Doctor's credibility - most physicians say there is nothing you can do to "naturally increase your height - most of it is genetics<br>  <br>  An inch a month is HUGE! It looks like a overstatement...|`|Lj59lazWaa	The most important factors that realize your growth are affected when you are a child, and puberty after that.  Your height is determined by your genetics, but you may not develop properly if you do not eat a balanced diet, get a suitable amount of rest, etc. So what I am saying is that it is not possible to get taller, but it is possible to not become the height you are "meant" to be.<br>  The one thing that can make you seem taller is actually stretching-- yoga and pilates--  and most importantly, your posture!   You'd be surprised how improper posture could cause an inch, and even two.  <br>  |`|RPw1qN4vaa	Food, I doubt has any effect on your height, except protein. When your hormones kick in, you'll grow taller.|`|ioUrcBh3aa	nooooo|`|tLr0PAfDaa	Your doctor is not right...boys and girls will naturally grow till 20s...|`|v0sP9I5yaa	yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

I was raised Catholic too, and being a Catholic, I know a little something about guilt. I also know that if you've asked God for forgiveness for something you feel you shouldn't have done but did anyway, then God forgives you. He knows your heart and He can tell when you really need something (like forgiveness or the strength to give up masturbating). I can't tell you not to feel guilty because that wouldn't make you feel any less guilty. I've done some things that I felt extremely guilty for, but one day, I got down on my knees and begged for God's forgiveness. It seemed like as soon as I got up, I felt better because I knew God had just forgiven me and forgotten about what I did. Now I never think about what I did because I know God doesn't. Just believe that God has forgotten what you did, so you should too.

About 30,000 people in the UK die from lung cancer each year. More than 8 in 10 cases are directly related to smoking. <br>  <br>  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). About 25,000 people in the UK die each year from this serious lung disease. More than 8 in 10 of these deaths are directly linked to smoking. People who die of COPD are usually quite unwell for several years before they die. <br>  <br>  Heart disease is the biggest killer illness in the UK. About 120,000 people in the UK die each year from heart disease. About 1 in 7 of these deaths are due to smoking. <br>  <br>  Other cancers - of the mouth, nose, throat, larynx, gullet (oesophagus), pancreas, bladder, cervix, blood (leukaemia), and kidney are all more common in smokers. <br>  <br>  Circulation. The chemicals in tobacco can damage the lining of the blood vessels and affect the level of lipids (fats) in the bloodstream. This increases the risk of atheroma forming (sometimes called 'hardening' of the arteries). Atheroma is the main cause of heart disease. It is also the main cause of strokes, peripheral vascular disease (poor circulation of the legs), and aneurysms (swollen arteries which can burst causing internal bleeding). All of these atheroma-related diseases are more common in smokers. <br>  <br>  Sexual problems. Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to become impotent or have difficulty in maintaining an erection in middle life. This is thought to be due to smoking-related damage of the the blood vessels to the penis. <br>  <br>  Ageing. Smokers tend to develop more 'lines' on their face at an earlier age than non-smokers. This often makes smokers look older than they really are. <br>  <br>  Fertility is reduced in smokers (both male and female). <br>  Menopause. On average, women who smoke have a menopause nearly two years earlier than non-smokers. <br>  <br>  Other conditions where smoking often causes worse symptoms include: asthma, colds, flu, chest infections, tuberculosis, chronic rhinitis, diabetic retinopathy, hyperthyroidism, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and Crohn's disease. <br>  <br>  Smoking increases the risk of developing various other conditions including: optic neuropathy, cataract, macular degeneration, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, psoriasis, gum disease, tooth loss, osteoporosis and Raynaud's phenomenon. <br>  <br>  Smoking in pregnancy increases the risk of:<br>  <br>  Miscarriage. <br>  <br>  Complications of pregnancy, including bleeding during pregnancy, detachment of the placenta, premature birth, and ectopic pregnancy. <br>  Low birth weight. <br>  <br>  Babies born to women who smoke are on average 200 grams (8 oz) lighter than babies born to comparable non-smoking mothers. Premature and low birth weight babies are more prone to illness and infections. <br>  <br>  Congenital defects in the baby - such as cleft palate. <br>  <br>  Stillbirth or death within the first week of life - the risk is increased by about one-third. <br>  <br>  Poorer long-term growth, development, and health of the child. On average, compared to children born to non-smokers, children born to smokers are smaller, have lower achievements in reading and maths, and have an increased risk of developing asthma. <br>  <br>  <br>  How does smoking affect other people?<br>  <br>  Children and babies who live in a home where there is a smoker:<br>  <br>  Are more prone to asthma and ear, nose and chest infections. About 17,000 children under five years old in England and Wales are admitted to hospital each year due to illnesses caused by their parents smoking. <br>  <br>  Have an increased risk of dying from cot death (sudden infant death syndrome). <br>  <br>  Are more likely than average to become smokers themselves when older. <br>  <br>  On average, do less well at reading and reasoning skills compared to children in smoke-free homes, even at low levels of smoke exposure. <br>  <br>  Are at increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer as adults. <br>  <br>  <br>  Passive smoking of adults.<br>  <br>  You have an increased risk of lung cancer and heart disease if you are exposed to other people smoking for long periods of time. Tobacco smoke is also an irritant, and can make asthma and other conditions worse.|`|uRReUowHaa	Nicotine addiction, birth defects, black lung, gingivitis, yellow rotten teeth, esophagitis and ulcers just for a few. |`|Icpljlolaa	emphysema, stroke.|`|WZ0jWRasaa	"Smoking is an important risk factor for the three diseases that cause most deaths in Australia: heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. It is responsible for around 80% of all lung cancer deaths and 20% of all cancer deaths. Smoking has also been linked to cancers of the mouth, bladder, kidney, stomach and cervix, among others. Smokers are also at increased risk of having reduced lung function from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Using tobacco has been linked to a variety of other conditions, such as diabetes, peptic ulcers, some vision problems, and back pain.

Dont mess with your body like that, just exercise and eat less.  |`|kVQrAYMyaa	Ok.. i work at jenny craigs so i know all these things. i've made so many people loose like 20kg! and you don't stop eating like that!!  you'll just collaps! it could put you in to a seriouse situation and be in the hospital for a month or even worse... death! so don't do it! it also won't make you loose weight fast, because your body isn't going to be ready for this straight away so for the first 1 or 2 days you'll be putting on weight. food is very important in your diet! all you have to do is just eat healthy. have salad in every meal except breakfast (optional). you must eat 6 times a day! I know it might sound wierd and say "why?? im on a diet" but i learnt this from a pro! if you eat little and eat 6 times a day, you'll loose weight faster!<br>  heres wat you could do<br>  eg: breakfast: fruit, low fat yogurt or weetbix, oats<br>     <br>       morning tea: a fruit<br>  <br>        Lunch: salad, sandwich with lettus, tomato, etc healthy food<br>  <br>       afternoon tea: a fruit or anthing health and little<br>  <br>       dinner: salad, any healthy food eg fish<br>  <br>       desert: fruits<br>  <br>  <br>  also walking is very important! you can jog too if you like but by jogging you can hurt your back and pull a muscle and get tired quickly but with walking you can enjoy your self and excercise longer because you wont get that tired!<br>  <br>  I know that everyone wants to loose weight fast now because its summer and you want to be able to feel good in you bikinis and so on!<br>  <br>  So if you could eat 6 healthy meals and excercise for about 30mins a day, you'll loose about 4kg a week! which means in a month you'll loose about 16-20kg!! <br>  <br>  feel good this summer!! goodluck and hope i helped!<br>  <br>  |`|CjPtAEzmaa	Not eating so you can lose weight is called anorexia. It is a consuming disease that kills. I suggest you get the idea out of your mind immediately. <br>  <br>  If you really think you need to lose weight, talk to your doctor about diet options. You are not going to lose weight in a week, I'm sorry. :-( But it is much better to lose weight in a healthy way than to kill yourself doing it the wrong way.<br>  <br>  Some good sites discussing anorexia:<br>  <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/mentalhealth/eating/063.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mamashealth.com/anorexia.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mamashealth.com/anorexia.asp</a><br>  <br>  Have a wonderful day, and remember, no matter what anyone tells you, you are beautiful.|`|AA10447191	Depending on your body weight you could go a long time without eating without starving to death.

It's much healthier and quicker to just eat 3 meals a day according to serving size. The portions given by serving size guidelines are actually really tiny and yet they are healthy. Also exercise more, in the first week or so of exercise you will see a slight increase in weight as your body adds muscle (muscle weighs more than fat) and then you will start to lose weight since muscle pounds burn more calories than fat pounds. |`|iP314noXaa	You will lose weight fast, but you cannot fast for a long time without becoming extremely unhealthy.  Fasting will kill you, especially if your body is not used to  it.  And like everyone else says, when you eat after a fast or even just after a day of not eating, you gain much more with just one meal. It's not exactly a healthy way to go.<br>  <br>  Also, from the look of your other questions, I feel like I have to say that you sound depressed; anorexia is common with depression.  I know how you feel, if indeed you feel like you may have anorexia.  And trust me...restriction does not work.  Thin might look good now, but life is so much more important.

z5JkgFOyaa	Only a doctor can tell for sure if you have a yeast infection by taking a swab and run some tests. Most of us can sometimes tell by the feel, look, and smell that you have a yeast infection. If your symptoms don't match this list, or you are confused or uncertain, go see your doctor if at all possible.<br>  <br>  It feels like an intense itching, burning sensation, localized in your vagina and vulva. This itching is not always present, but can get really bad, so bad you can hardly walk, let alone sit still or concentrate on anything.<br>  <br>  It looks like clumpy white stuff. Most medical descriptions compare the discharge to ricotta cheese, but it can range from thick and not clumpy to faintly yellow to thin and clear. <br>  <br>  It smells like bread or beer. In fact, it smells pretty much exactly like yeast.<br>  <br>  There are other types of infections that can sometimes infect your vagina and vulva and it's helpful to know the symptoms of all of them so you can be really sure before you go treat yourself for a yeast infection you might not have. <br>  <br>  A bacterial infection of the vagina can feel a lot like a yeast infection if the vulval area is itchy or painful. Unlike a yeast infection, the discharge can be dark yellow, green, or brown and it won't smell like bread, it can smell like fish or something rotting. If you think you might have a bacterial infection, or if you're not sure, get I would recommend going to see your doctor as this has to be treated with prescription antibiotics. <br>  <br>  Urinary tract infections (UTI's) are due to bacteria infecting the urethra rather than the vagina. UTI's can be fairly easily distinguished from vaginal infections by a host of symptoms, including pain or burning when urinating, blood or mucus in urine, needing to urinate often, pain or pressure in back or lower abdomen and a fever or chills. If you think you might have a UTI, don't delay, go see your doctor, because the infection can travel up past the bladder, causing kidney damage. <br>  <br>  Another type of infection called trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite that can infect both the vagina and the urinary tract, and is primarily sexually transmitted. If you have a trichomoniasis infection, your vagina can be itchy or painful, it can hurt to urinate, intercourse can be painful, and occasionally you can experience pain in your lower abdomen. Again, you have to see a doctor to get antibiotics to treat this. <br>  <br>  I would recommend you see your doctor just to rule out any other infections and to get a proper diagnosis and proper treatment.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  |`|g3OCU69Zaa	if you have itching along with a cloudy discharge i would recommend going and getting an OTC kit for a yeast infection. |`|QL7ztuEOaa	go to your chemist and ask for something for vaginal thrush, they have creams and tablets normally.<br>  <br>  If it carries on you will need to see a doctor, as it could be something bacterial.

My daughter soon got it and the big thing to remember is that if you think its gone, its probably not. I had to keep checking and treating everyday for like a month, its not only a pain but expensive to get rid of. Just keep checking whether you think theyre gone or not.

For example, were they hugging? did they share a coat or blanket? Anything that could have brought the lice in close contact with your daughter raises the chances she may get them. If that's the case, I'd go to the store immediately and get some head lice treatment for everyone in the house. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure -- and sometimes lice can be a real pain to do away with!

I dare say there will be millions spent on this for 'science' research - tell them my answer, perhaps they will give me the money instead of wasting millions finding that out!    :)|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Well, I guess if you have to get up and move because you're about to puke then you know it must smell.    Edit - sticky is right....i was just talking to my hubby on the phone, and i told him about this question (yes, i am bored lol) and this is what he said - "the loud farts are usually not stinky because they go AROUND the turd, and the quiet ones are usually awful because they go THROUGH the turd."  Ewww, that is sooo much worse to see it typed out!  LOL|`|kz9O7QKwaa	I rely on...my nose!|`|WLPDJ3Npaa	The smelly guys in your farts are called mercaptains :-)|`|88a821ff156d404073518f9a8da929c6aa	The little ones that you think can be sneaked out on the sly always turn out to be shockers.|`|99e7bdf52351f3b311f9ac6c5577786eaa	U can differentiate it by letting it through ur nose.........    Have you ever read who cuts the cheese by Jim Dawson? It has discussions about farts..    Here is an answer taken from the book:    " The fart is mostly created by E.Coli and other bacteria in ur intestine that feast upon fermenting food and then collectively microfart inside you; the air you swallow and your stomach's alkaline secretions also have an effect on your farts. On the average, a fart is composed of abt 59% nitrogen, 21%hydrogen, 9% CO2, 7% methane and 4%O2.  But less than 1% is made up of tiny amounts of other chemicals such as ammonia or skatole that stink so pungently, people can smell them at levels of 1 part in 100 million parts of air..."|`|pnI6y7VGaa	Farts stink so deaf people can enjoy them also.

m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

VCIZJQCJaa	health care is unreachable for many americans,especially now since people loosing jobs also loose health care.there are reasons for this,the insurance companies are another corporate rip off.they have consistently increased premiums and lowered planned services.having insurance is almost like having a 5% discount card.so many people just go to the emergency room,then costs are added to premiums to absorb losses.another is our government has never regulated the food industry.no other country in the world offers so much toxic food.so all the obese,and disease caused by this is putting a burden on the system.not enough emphasis on prevention.if you notice america has more disease and more prescriptions instead of less.only 1% average is  disease (eg cancer research)they all know what's causing this.the system is out of control.the Canadian or european health care system's won't work in the usa .it only works with smaller populated countries.so for now we are going to have to suffer|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	by "today's society" I assume you mean the united states, and frankly I think the entire country should be ashamed of the health care situation faced by it's citizens.  Every other modern country on the planet takes care of it's own.  No one has to worry about being able to pay for health care to the extent that americans do.  Considering how much we pay in taxes now, we get precious little return for our dollar aside from having the richest politicians in the world.  I say stop providing our government with free health care for life, make them pay the same things the common citizen has to pay, and you will see something done about the usurious costs in health care.

She knew something was wrong when she had my first mammogram of 2006. One breast hurt and the other didnt.    She got a call two weeks later to do a second mammogram on my left breast. After it was read, the doctor came in to tell me that she had calcifications in her left breast and needed to schedule a biopsy. She was so scared that the fear changed her visual perception.     She got my diagnosis of Ductal Cancer In Situ (DCIS). A week later she had a surgery.     Her lymph nodes showed no signs of cancer. One of the reasons she chose a mastectomy was because she knew she wouldnt have to have chemo or radiation treatments if the cancer hadnt spread to the lymph nodes.  - -  If I would have had to have chemo or radiation, I would have needed someone to take me to the appointments, and to help comfort me through any sickness afterward. I would have needed help connecting with organizations that provided head coverings if Id had hair loss.
kaaP8y2oaa	its almost as bad as  not having..the system just sucks..|`|EuUQuFnoaa	Well they don't actually want you to *use* your health care.  It's lame!  Lame Lame Lame!|`|alYomnsvaa	People are lazy and they have a captive customer base.  I agree it sucks!|`|M1NZGkBkaa	Why are they impossible? I think it is because at some point they realized it can be a business for profit over being a business for people. By creating stricter road blocks and ridiculous coverage policies that clearly undermine people in a way that maximizes their profits and minimizes their payouts is the most obvious sign.    Out of experience, my best advice is to study up on the appeal process for your specific insurance company and if you keep hitting those road blocks seek out a lawyer. Even if escalating it to a lawyer doesn't produce results the key phrase is "appeal process" when dealing with insurance companies directly and/or in court. You have to be very persistent and never give up when dealing with them and take it as far as you can... even if you have to take it from local to federal courts if you have to. I've seen people go that far if it means this much to them.    As for dealing with the VA - good luck. As they tend to drag their feet due to being underfunded, understaffed, and underperformed. Best bet is to seek medical attention elsewhere and stuffer the consequences through local/state income support as it does exist if you look hard enough for it. Also can always hope that newly President Obama will do as he campaigned last year about fixing the broken VA system by allowing military to use regular hospitals with their card. It should have been made that way years ago.|`|rP6CHrwgaa	These days everything is becoming impossible.....|`|XwWQx4Cgaa	U.S. health insurance sucks big time,    http://www.healthsymphony.com/index.htm    i did watch a BBC documentary about it 2 weeks ago they are huge criminals    i try to find it and post it    http://news.videosift.com/video/BBC-docu...|`|5boLbxzdaa	They're a bunch of beotches!

0lnamekJaa	Does your father have type 1 or type 2?    BIG DIFFERENCE.    Type 1 is what you are BORN WITH and there is a higher likelyhood that you have it.     Some people I know didn't get diagnosed with type 1 until they were in their teens...    Type 2 is a combo of gentics and diet and body weight and insulin resistance.    So if you keep exercising and eat a healthy diet low in non-complex carbs (Like sugar and white flour and sugars and alcohol) then you will most likely not get it.|`|oNSiaGooaa	Not Necessary , but there are big chances though, consult with your doctor and make changes to your life style like adding exercise and good eating habits to your daily life will be beneficial.|`|zpIrU1yCaa	It depends on whether it is Type I or Type II.  Type 1 may be passed down the gene line but Type II is caused by factors such as obesity, heart disease and smoking.|`|7gWkuzcXaa	no no , some people gets diabetes from their parents by inheritance , but its not necessary , for example my grandma have diabetes , my uncles have too , and my mom doesn't.. see ? but i highly recommend that you make a diabetes analysis specially if you are young . so that you can treat / partially treat it before it gets worst .. i hope you won't have it any way , and you dad will treat it :) :)|`|ZNbauLJzaa	My son's diabetes educator has type 1 diabetes.  He has had it for years.  He has children who are just fine.  I recently asked him if his kids are at a much higher risk than other kids and he said it is a slighly higher risk, but not so high that he's particularly worried about his.      So, yes, you have a higher risk of developing diabetes, but no need to be fearful.  Be aware of the sypmtoms, but I bet if you had something wrong your dad would notice before you do!|`|nfIQhpFvaa	Diabetes is quite hereditary, and yet there are no guarantees of having it either. You can be predisposed to diabetes, either type I, typically an autoimmune diabetes or type II diabetes where insulin resistance is the issue at hand. Again, you can be predisposed to diabetes where your likelihood of becoming diabetic is increased.    Having relatives that are diabetic warrants diligence in maintaining a healthy lifestyle int hat you do all possible to mitigate the risk of type II diabetes where as with type 1 diabetes is not something one can stave away.    Hereditary diabetes can skip generations, and, it often does. The American Diabetes Association as well as the US Centers for disease control have published many exhaustive articles on this very thing.    Things you can do right now:    1. Eat healthy, don't skip meals, count carb intake, set a limit for carb intake. Substitute low to no carb foods over carb rich foods. Limit fat intake. Drink water instead of soda or milk.    2. Avoid being sedentary. Walk more, when parking your car, park further away from your "ideal up close spot", thus, walking a greater distance. Take up bike riding.    3. See your doctor. Watch your cholesterol and triglycerides carefully. Ask your physician for a an HbA1c to get a 90 day snap shot at your blood glucose levels.    4. Proper rest. Set a schedule to where you go to sleep at approximately the same time every night, wake up at approximately the same time daily. The body repairs and regenerates the most during sleep, and this process works best when one has had adequate sleep. Healthy habits now mean establishing and maintaining wellness.     Diabetes is not completely preventable, there are other factors, but a healthy body now certainly factors into prevention, but should it come to pass where diabetes does manifest itself in you in the future, you will already be better prepared to deal with it.|`|i63B4F94aa	No not nesscarly, (spelling error) but it just means that you have a chance on getting it. but not 100%|`|LmBZqlEvaa	maybe you have to.  you can general cek up to know.|`|zH8aMM9Raa	It depends, if he has type 1 or 2.

u4TfcwhTaa	Here are some ways to gain weight!!<br>  <br>  What To Eat To Gain Weight<br>  Increasing your intake of junk foods and greasy foods is not a good way to gain weight. Junk foods usually contain unhealthy trans fats or saturated fats. Even though you need to increase your calorie consumption to gain weight, those calories should come from foods that are good for you. <br>  Healthy fats include omega-3 essential fatty acids sources like tuna, salmon, flax, and walnuts. Good sources of protein include lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes. Healthy carbohydrate sources include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. <br>  <br>  It may be easier to eat five or six smaller balanced meals per day rather than eating three large meals, especially if you are not used to eating much at one sitting. <br>  <br>  Protein powders and nutritional supplement drinks such as Ensure (buy direct) can be added as in-between meal snacks if you still need more calories. Some protein powders are flavored and only need added water and some others can be blended with your choice of juice or milk to improve the taste. <br>  <br>  It would also be a healthy idea to add a small amount of flax seed oil and some psyllium powder to add some omega-3 essential fatty acids and extra fiber. <br>  <br>  Dietary Supplements and Gaining Weight<br>  A high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement is a good idea to make sure you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals you need. Some people find that their muscle mass increases with protein supplements that contain certain blends of amino acids such as creatine (buy direct) and glutamine (buy direct). Some people who are very ill may need liquid nutritional preparations that are available through their doctors.

AA12264519	I usually have plain oatmeal mixed with fruit. Try adding blueberries, strawberries, fresh peach or apple slices, raisins, cranberries, or almond slivers. Fruit sugar (fructose) is much healthier than white table sugar (glucose).<br>  <br>  Portion control if key, even if you are eating healthier.

It's the ACTUAL all natural sweetener.  No added preservatives or food chemicals used by commercial food distributors.  So you can have the sweetnesss mother nature intended, kind of like in fruits as opposed to cookies.

tXONUHBIaa	You might try physioball ab crunches. These are a super slow set of crunches where you lay on your back on  physioball with knees bent, put your hands behind head and elbows out to the sides. Then lift each vertebra off the floor one by one until you're in the sit up position then do the same all the way back down to the begining posistion. Barely stop at the top and at the bottom. Keep in constant motion. Do these to fatigue making sure to breathe throughout the exercise. Follow up with 2 sets of alternating obliques where you take each elbow and go to the opposite sidewhile you ar "curling up.". Being careful to again lift each vertebra off the ball one by one. And, concentrate on making a smooth arc in the air with your elbow then alternate sides. No matter how far you get you will have worked both sides evenly. <br>  If you're also loosing some weight at the same time you'll see tone more quickly because you'll have less of the subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin) and see definition more quickly. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chiromedica.net/Sports-Medicine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiromedica.net/Sports-Medici...</a>|`|dMqytjONaa	Well the easy answer to your question is Cardio.<br>  <br>  Losing weight and burning fat all to do with eating right and burning calories through cardio. Does that mean running and jogging, yes and no, walking is also a cardio exercise.<br>  <br>  You have to do enough cardio to burn x amount of calories. 1 pound of fat is roughly 3500 calories. So to loose 1 pound off your body, then you need to burn 3500 calories, best done through diet and exercise. Where will the fat come off your body. We are all designed to store fat differently, if your body is inclined to store it on your belly and thighs, then genetically you are also programmed to lose it there first too.<br>  <br>  So hit the gym or whatever get burning those cals, and see results.<br>  <br>  This site has a lot of great info on this subject, I suggest you check it out|`|2CFZrPhVaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite hard, many would say impossible, but the only diet that really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

And read the labels to check out the sodium levels.  More and more companies are making low-sodium or no-sodium-added foods so look for those.  Initially, you'll miss the salt but over time you're tastebuds will get used to less salt.  Mrs. Dash (I think that's the one) makes herb mixtures to add to things to make them taste good.  Crushed sesames add flavor.  Garlic of course in all forms (but be careful not to buy garlic salt, garlic powder is fine).  And a lot depends on what food your are cooking/eating.  Lemons and limes.  Spicy peppers.  Just let your imagination go and experiment.  And read labels.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	stay away from processed foods|`|dUj7rP2haa	Most processed foods are higher in sodium then unprocessed foods.  If you eat a lot of canned soup, you may want to think about making your own.  If you make a big batch on the weekend you can easily freeze it in individual servings.  Most spices (but not necessarily spice mixes) are salt free and can be used to add flavor.|`|fNYibU37aa	Cut down on processed foods.  It takes a little more time but you can make things like soup, sauces, casseroles (like hamburger helper) from scratch.  They taste better and you can control how much sodium is added if any.  Also, look at this site... Bittersweet Herb Farm dry seasonings are great.  I have replaced almost every seasoning in my kitchen with one of their flavors.  They are natural with no added salt, sugar or preservatives but with great taste!<br>  <a href="http://www.bittersweetherbfarm.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=1&zenid=9502b19c9a11c29bafc0f0291ff38070" rel="nofollow">http://www.bittersweetherbfarm.com/index...</a>

Alli says that combined with diet and exercise you can lose half again what you would have without it.  This means if you are already losing 2 lbs. per week, or 8 lbs. per month, you can lose 4 extra lbs. per month if also using Alli.  So it isn't a quick fix, the weight isn't going to fall off, but if you use it properly and stick to a diet and exercise routine, the weight may come off a bit faster than if you were going it alone.|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|rRUMA2YVaa	You HAVE to work out!! This is the only way any diet works.  Alli is good but it has nasty side affects.  A pound per week is good.

mCbhjcLuaa	Get advice from you doctor because you are already physically fit.<br>  To some people that is a blessing and to some a curse.<br>  The only way your muscles will get smaller is if you don't exercise and that would make your situation worse.
R9PrhuuHaa	you'll just have to eat healthy and wait it out. i know many people who grow like crazy like 3 feet in like a year. just be patient|`|1oNi2v38aa	Eat more. You're going to OD on calcium there buddy.
DPBgVA6Caa	You don't. Sorry to be negative but it's pretty much impossible to gain 10lbs of pure muscle in 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Also you say 'buffer' but that can be an umbrella term. Do you mean bulkier or more defined?<br>  <br>  Also you don't say whether you work out a lot or not?<br>  <br>  I want to help you but you've just given me almost nothing to go on and your aims are pretty ludicrous.
HlD9dRF2aa	Walk.  You need exercise to boost your metabolism, otherwise your body will just readjust and slow down to compensate for the lower caloric intake.  <br>  <br>  For every 20 miles walked, 1 lb gets burned off (put your daughter in a stroller and start walking--indoors if possible at a mall).  If you get more ambitious start jogging/running, but by all means invest in a good jogging stroller with big wheels on Craigslist or at a garage sale.  Fill it with diapers, milk, water -- as if you're going to be stranded for 12 hours.  That's what I do with my daughter.<br>  <br>  For you drug pushers out there:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/acai-berry.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/aca...</a><br>  <br>  (There is no proof that acai berry works and if it is so great how come Oprah can't keep the bloody weight off?

It's just a frickin blueberry subspecies from Brazil and has just as many antioxidants as broccoli or blueberries.)|`|TAS1vdr9aa	Maybe a couple pounds but the key to losing weight is exercise. If you have a half hour, you can exercise. Go to target/walmart whatever store and buy one of those dvds like kickboxing, or my favorite "walk away the pounds" while your daughter is taking a nap, or before work take a half hour and do the tapes ! They really are worth it, fun, and usually work into schedules. You are doing a great thing by eating good foods also ! <br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|NbdZoxxQaa	If you have a super fast metabolism maybe, but all of the pros suggest exercise too. <br>  If you really do not have time to work out then try walking as much as possible, do not take any short cuts and try to take the longest way around to get to places. A little extra walking here and there really does help a lot. <br>  Good for you for including drinking lots of water! most people forget that, but water is the most important thing for any diet. Ice water helps you burn calories a little bit faster than warm water too, so that might help.|`|RJdWIHR7aa	Do a water fast it cleans out your system and you will lose loads of weight but don't do it if you are breast feeding. and look it up so you dont put all the weight back on when you start eating again. :)
zhk8o514aa	That is very realistic.  Actually its healthy to lose 2-3 pounds a week.  If you want to push your self to lose that much.  Go ahead and good luck. <br>  <br>  You will need to do a bit more exercising though. Also portion your food.  The meat (chicken,beef,pork roast..ect) should not be any bigger nor thicker then your hand. On a plate divide your plate into 1/4ths. and follow this<br>  <br>  1/4 -meat<br>  1/4- carbs<br>  2/4  veggies ( Only 1 tablespoon of dressing! or better yet steam it and add seasoning)|`|qO3w1Iq7aa	yea im doing kinda the same thing do you think we could e mail back and forth about this cause i have been trying to do find someone who is trying to do the same thing.

There are plenty of opportunities to fail in the big wide world don't you think?! The one method that really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

My friend was the same as you, 80lbs, 4'11" ft and when she turned 15 she shot up to 5'7" and got some more meat on her body. In the meantime, there is underwear that lifts up your butt. I think you can find it on macys.com. For your bust, I know they say weight lifting makes it smaller, but for me, it's made mine bigger. I do the decline bench press and that exercises the muscle under your breast and it lifts mine up. I always try and do the max amount of weight to bulk up the muscle. You could probably do that for your thighs and butt too, lifting weight. and do the more weight and less reps. NOT what girls usually do to lose weight, which is less weight and more reps.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Go jogging.|`|uw2lRgmeaa	Work out honey, just work out daily and eat or drink energy drinks, hi in fat but nutritious.

wLFM00iiaa	what you really don't want to do is to go on a all fatty food oily greasy gross diet because you will gain way too much fat and it will be awful for your health (arteries, heart etc) Instead broaden your diet and eat more - not more of fat but think carbs (bread) eggs that sort of thing - breakfast - oatmealporridgee with 2 slices of wholemeal toast and then fruit and a glass of juice and whatever else. you can also get these snack bars which starving people in africa get given to gain weight fast - but youdon'tt want lots of flab. if you cant take it all in at once then slowly start to build up your diet. remember if you want to be in the marines you dont want to be a couch potato :) i have the opposite - i want to loose weight - AND FAST. the other option - if you are really desperately in need then you can get weight implants but this should be worst case scenario...hope this helped xx|`|1oNi2v38aa	Lift weights to gain muscle.

Us ladies need iron, especially when "Aunt Flo" visits every month.<br>  <br>  Remember, no salt or oil/cream dressings. If anything, use pepper, mustard, balsamic vinegar|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Lean red meat in small amounts from time to time is okay.

r5pyDwcbaa	The most important thing is that your still young.  Having the correct mindset now will help you as you get older.  The first thing you need to realize is that changes are not going to happen over night.  Becoming fit is a LONG process.  It will take a lot of commitment. Start off slow, and just try doing small things like no more snacking after or before dinner.  Maybe walk some place that you would normally get a ride too. Then slowly try and add new little things.  If you try and jump head first you are going to get frustrated.
uTPeYO4kaa	because she's 12 and everybody has an incredible metabolism at age 12|`|hUfgIX3eaa	She is still a kid.  Her metabolism is running at a higher rate than an adult, and she probably moves a lot.

0eOfphnRaa	Walking, of course, is an exercise. A cardio exercise at that.<br>  <br>  It works on your heart muscles by revving up the heart rate, so your heart is kept strong & fit, helping you reduce risk of heart diseases & strokes.<br>  <br>  It also speeds up your metabolism, getting you easier to burn off excess fat from your entire body, to lose weight.<br>  <br>  You can walk at a fast or a slow pace. It's still exercise (or workout).<br>  <br>  However, to maximize your walking, it would make sense to walk at a brisk pace or do a race walk (walk as if you're in a race), to burn off more calories and to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Here's a guide on walking and the calories you can burn: <a href="http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/calories-burned-walking.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/calor...</a>|`|POHWTDPRaa	Yeah, walking counts.

Like you said, it will help stretch everything out a bit.<br>  <br>  Walking is actually really good for you, and any little bit helps.|`|G1OSlub8aa	walking is good exercise and is recommended to people with low to moderate fitness levels to lose weight and maintain cardiovascular fitness.|`|TDjTLnTbaa	Walking is exercise....its a sport any sport is some sort of exercise|`|1oNi2v38aa	Do a light jog, or speed walk.|`|EHPxCp7paa	yes...
T3OGT4Ntaa	Lol, I wish I had that problem!  By yelling she is probably trying to keep you motivated so you don't fall behind the others, she probably doesn't realize that you really don't want the results.  Like the others said, talk to her before class and tell her exactly what you told us.  If she still persists, tell her you'd rather stretch or something instead.|`|IFd94XDkaa	You need to talk to her before or after the class and just tell her that you won't be doing that portion of the workout.  I don't think you really have to tell her why, just tell her that you won't be doing it and you'd appreciate her not yelling at you.  <br>  <br>  You're paying to take a class so in a way she works for you.  You sort of hired her as a trainer/guide sort of thing so you don't owe her any kind of explanation.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Walk out of the class and get a drink. Stop her class. Tell her you choose not to. She can't force you. Trainers and instructors just do that as a way of motivating. Don't worry about it. Honestly, there are plenty of people who would love to have your problem.|`|NZ2tS11maa	Before the class tell her you have a medical reason not to do them.....pulled muscle or something.

You can eat the same amount of food and lose weight if you switch to foods with less fat.  Things like cheese, chocolate, mayonnaise, fried foods (like crisps), and ice cream are all high-calorie foods with high fat content that should be avoided or eaten in small amounts.     <br>  <br>  If your parents are preparing high-fat meals, you may need to talk to them about your weight concerns and ask if they could help you with meals that are healthier.  In my family, that would probably that i would have to start preparing some of the meals.    There's many different places on the web where you can get healthy recipes that you could try.|`|AA12264519	Try not to eat for 3 hours before bedtime. The food calories are more likely to be stored as fat when you are sleeping since your metabolism goes way low.<br>  If you must eat, then try not to eat unhealthy junk foods. Maybe have a glass of milk (which may fill you up) instead of biscuits and ice cream.<br>  <br>  Portion control is also key, even if you are eating healthy. Larger portions means more calories.<br>  <br>  Overall, just eat healthier and exercise is a must.|`|KT8i2YL7aa	Targetted weight reduction is quite hard, some would state impossible, however the only diet that really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials left, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed thrity pounds, it really does produce success!
J3A9Pqq2aa	Add milk to the cheerios, it's good for you. Toss the bread, was the dressing light? If not switch that, what kind of sauce was in the ravioli? You need way more protein as well. Basically, you didn't eat well at all. It's not that you ate too much to lose weight, but you chose the wrong foods.
2jMFurDoaa	ok why is your test so far away?<br>  <br>  that doesnt make sense, doctors can do those kinds of test immediately...if its concerning you that much you would probably be getting it down a hell of alot sooner.<br>  <br>  ...weird.|`|FI916ISFaa	I don't believe that you can get aids from dreams.|`|jdZfzZUjaa	Not likely that you have HIV/AIDS.

S7Q3fRvoaa	You're right... starving your body of calories would not be a good idea.  Im not even sure that going that low would be a good idea (im not sure of your height).<br>  <br>  However, if you feel that it is necessary, you can lose weight without losing muscle tone.  Just make sure you are working out.  I would suggest weight training 3-4X a week  (allow rest days in between or work different muscle groups each day.)  And be sure to eat a lot, i mean A LOT of lean proteins.  Chicken breast, tuna, beans, low fat or fat free dairy, and lean cut ground turkey are all great options.   Other than that, there's not much else you can do.... but if you dont eat enough (at least 1200, even for someone losing weight) your body will eat away at your muscle.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|TrvFnYnmaa	I've been using Acai Berry for a while now and so far I've seen some great results.

There is an also fresh squeeze of lime and lemon that takes the food to a tropical place. Don’t be afraid to mix and match your dishes as long as you stay within your counts for that meal and for that day. Remember that you need to eat for what you have coming up not for what you have already done. Say if you know you are going to take a nap after a meal then don’t eat so many carbs because you will not be burning them off.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	She is growing right now so an increase in food would be expected, but you just need to make sure what shes starting to eat is healthy. I would think the best way to do this is only provide her with healthy foods. Clear out your home of junk food, and replace it with fruits, veggies, and other healthy things. But don't completely deprive her of some of those foods just make sure their at a minimum. Pack her lunch. School meals are completely unhealthy, even things that look healthy are full of preservatives, fats, and sugars. Just help her make the right decisions, and guide her through it. There are also tons of recipes on the web to turn unhealthy foods like nachos into something much better for your daughter.|`|0WR6oPxhaa	Actually, you don't need to diet in fact if you want to lose weight, the one method which clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it was reported in Fox News and CNN.

tXmu16Niaa	Drink more water.  Sometimes your body gets confused when it is thirsty and thinks that it is hungry instead.  Try drinking 16 oz glass of water next time you get the urge to eat and see if that helps.  If you don't like plain water, try it with a few slices of lemon or lime, or opt for flavored water--just be sure you read the nutritonal facts on it.  Also, if you are about to sit down for a meal try drinking a full glass of water thirty minutes beforehand.  It will make you feel more full by the time you start actually eating food.|`|m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet.

There are too many variables. including muscle and bone mass, to accurately suggest any weight for any person. But, you seem to be asking about your BMI, which is a table for suggesting a "healthy weight" without taking into account variables, such as bone and muscle. You can find it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obes...</a><br>  But, like I said, other variables need to be taken into account before you can figure out how much you should weigh.|`|kCM1counaa	Between 165-195, depending on your build.  If you work out, then closer to the upper range.  maybe 190 would be ideal
xlFwLTCFaa	Activity and healthy eating.  Don't sweat the confidence thing...you are going to work on that.  First you need to figure out how many calories you should be eating:<br>  "For sedentary people: Weight x 14 = estimated cal/day<br>  <br>  For moderately active people: Weight x 17 = estimated cal/day<br>  <br>  For active people: Weight x 20 = estimated cal/day "<br>  <br>  Eat Breakfast, lunch, a snack, dinner, and a snack.  For Breakfast try Total or another cereal with whole grain and 100 calories/serving with skim milk, or a smoothie (buy frozen strawberries, pour 10 in with 1 cup of orange juice, a banana, and one scoop of vanilla whey protein (can get at the vitamin shop) blend, and add water if needed.)  <br>  <br>  For lunch and dinner try to keep within the calorie count, and the snacks should be no more than 100 calories.  The snacks are huge...no chips and cookies.  Try these new yogurts that taste like pies and deserts.<br>  <br>  You have to exercise, but that doesn't mean sports.  If you are really heavy and don't exercise at all...go for a long walk.  I mean for an hour.  It is tough, but stick with it.  You'll find soon you'll be able to jog, then run.  Take baby steps, but make up your mind to change your body.  Don't change to be prettier, but to be healthier.  If you stay overweight you could end up getting diabetes, heart disease, etc.  You don't want that...trust me.  Wishing you the best of luck.|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	just dont eat snacks.  if you really try you can do it. <br>  keep water with u.  nd join  the track team.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	Go jogging around the block or around a park. People don't take any notice of people just jogging on the side walk so you don't need to worry about people seeing you. Or ask your parents if you can get a treadmill or exercise bike, they are great. Especially if you are shy about being outside and exercising and your parents can know where you are and that you are safe. You can get a exercise bike on ebay for about $100<br>  If you don't want to leave the house and you cant get the treadmill or exercise bike, then get a skipping rope and use that for 10 Min's a day for a week, then 15 Min's a day for a week, then 20 Min's a day for a week etc, until you can do 30 Min's without being tired and having to stop which will get you fit and loose weight.

roe07rI8aa	Whatever will be will be.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	I'm confused. You're hoping for a positive.....pregnancy test? And you're having mild cramps and spotting so you think that means you're pregnant?? Cramping and spotting if you're pregnant could be normal but it could also be the beginning of a miscarriage, if I'm even on the same subject that you are.  ????? I don't get it.|`|GhrJVbFEaa	You will need to provide more information on your cycle/time line. How many days since possible conception or how many days since your last period?  Implantation generally occurs something like 7-10 (maybe 14) days after conception. Not everyone experiences implantation spotting. I've had three pregnancies and never had it but I did have the very mild cramping right at implantation time.  If an embryo had implanted, you should be able to do a pregnancy test. The hormone levels really rise after implantation. Do the test first thing in the morning to get the most reliable results. Good luck.|`|hKTBwHvGaa	i think it could be thats just my oppinion

6w1e6zUVaa	Check this out young man.  At your age if you play, and hopefully excel at, two sports then you are as healthy as you can be without making yourself unhealthy by unnecessary dieting.  I experience the same situation when I was your age: 12 years old, 5'6 and weighed 180.  And just like you, I didn't have much fat to speak of.  What you need to ask yourself is, "Do I appear overweight?"  If you can honestly answer that question with a, "no" then you're fine.  My sophomore year I played varsity fullback and was bigger (not fatter), and stronger in the weight room then most of the senior offensive linemen who were two-three years older then me.  Now @ 26 years old I'm only 5'11 and weigh 245 but when people look at me they'd swear that I'm not any more than 200.  When you turn on the t.v. and watch the NFL you look at linebackers who are very slender but still weigh any where from 220-250.  You'll grow into your body soon enough and you, AND the girls you'll go to school with, will love your size.  Eat right, work out hard and your body will take care of itself in due time.|`|dUj7rP2haa	Yes, you should just wait... there is a very good chance your body will need to save up significant stores of energy for your growing. Concentrate on eating quality food and don't worry about quantity.|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Well, you should try a light diet; I would try to have healthy cereal or eggs for breakfast every day, and just watch your caloric and carb intake; you'll lose weight over time. Also, crunches wouldn't hurt! :)

dMqytjONaa	It all depends. Eating protein is still a calorie. Each gram of protein equals about 4 calories, however the diet and exercise magazines trick you into thinking that you need excess amounts of protein.<br>  <br>  Will extra protein cause you to gain weight? It depends what your BMR is (basal metabolic rate). There plenty of online calculators for this. Let's assume that your body needs only 1500 calories to maintain its weight let's say you already ate this today and now you decided to pound back that protein shake, what happens???<br>  <br>  You will store the extra calories on your body as FAT!, it doesn't matter if it was protein or a big mac and a bag of chips, extra calories means your body will store those as fat.<br>  <br>  This site has alot of great information on this alot more then I can describe in just a few paragraphs|`|V6pE6S7iaa	thats fine sis protein is good and it burns quickly|`|G1OSlub8aa	Did you know that unused amino acids in protein are converted to fat.

AA11104042	I've also read this book and am using the law of attraction to lose weight. I don't think The Secret contradicts anything about exercising and eating healthy. The book is about the power of the mind over matter, the law of attracting what you fill your mind with. So people who don't know about it, but who eat healthily and exercise are basically attracting the weight loss to them because they are expecting these practices to have an influence on their body. If I want strong arms, I lift weights. I think to myself: I'm making my arms stronger when I do this. So even though I'm doing an activity to get what I want, I'm also drawing it to me by expecting it. And remember, there is a certain amount of science and biology involved. Our minds, however, are far more powerful than we can even know. I don't think it's reasonable to do this method and eat horrible foods. Take care of yourself and exercise, you can use these as tools to get your mind in the right place to attract the perfect weight for you.|`|DhwcHdfVaa	Lol I would love to imagine eating bars and bars of chocolate would make me lose weight, but unfortunately I don't think its possible. I guess however the psychological aspect is eating healthy and when you do start losing imagining your the perfect shape. <br>  <br>  The only problem is that calories are calories, and its the whole burn more than you eat factor.

Clean your bathroom or windows. Not only does it keep you busy but the smell gets to you and makes food unappetizing<br>  2. Brush your teeth or chew gum. Most foods taste gross with minty breath<br>  3. Think about chewing the food you want to eat. Then think about chewing on a buch of hair. Then think about eating the food again. Thats enough for me to turn down just about anything.<br>  4. Paint your nails. The smell is so strong that eating anything tastes like polish<br>  5. Go for a drive and bring minimal cash so you won't be tempted to get food but your out of your house and away from the temptation of food<br>  <br>  Hope I helped
T3OGT4Ntaa	You CAN stop yourself, you just need to learn to exercise self-control.  I have the same problem - I love food!  To keep my weight regulated I exercise a LOT and I drink tons of water to keep my appetite normal.|`|SYccJO3Haa	Hi there - I truly believe that food is one of the things to which people can become addicted and I also think it is much easier than people imagine. I get so mad when people tell an alcoholic not to touch alcohol ever again or they tell a smoker to never smoke again and then they try and tell food addicts - just have one biscuit and don't eat the whole packet - how mad is that?!<br>  <br>  I've been where you are and I have spent c.15 years researching why people overeat. I have discovered that there are 3 (very common) medical conditions, which cause insatiable food cravings.<br>  <br>  The 3 conditions are:<br>  1) Candida (which causes cravings for anything sweet, bread, cakes, biscuits and also some strange things like grapes, blue cheese and pickled foods);<br>  2) Food Intolerance (which causes cravings for anything to which you are intolerant - usually wheat - which is the base for cakes, biscuits, pasta, bread, pizza etc) and<br>  3) Hypoglycaemia (which causes cravings for anything sweet from fruit to cakes)<br>  <br>  If you are addicted to food, I would put money on you having at least one of these conditions - if not all three. The essence of the way out is that you have to stop eating the foods to which you are addicted. You don't have to give them up for ever, but you do have to give them up long enough to get these 3 conditions back under control so you don't crave food again. <br>  <br>  Phase 1 of the Harcombe Diet has been designed to be the best diet to overcome all 3 conditions. It lets you eat meat, fish, eggs, salads, vegetables (no mushrooms or potatoes), natural live yoghurt and some brown rice for 5 days. You avoid fruit, all sugar and processed food, all other grains. The book talks you through what the conditions are and how you got them and how you get rid of them and stop craving food.<br>  <br>  There is quite a lot of info on the web site sources below, so I hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  Good luck - food addiction is really not fun<br>  All the best - Zoe<br>  All the best - zoe@whydoyouovereat.com

VUAF4ZnMaa	Calories is a big subject when it comes to weight loss. We need to understand 3 things: the volume of calories in our food, the volume of calories a specific physical action expends every sixty minutes, and finally our own personal daily limit of calories. The sole method that really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today.

Even then, your body is still growing and developing, so it's not as straightforward to simply say "you're under/overweight".<br>  <br>  At your age, just try to eat a reasonably balanced diet, and be sure to get plenty of exercise.

mG2lZRrXaa	First, make sure you should gain weight: go to a doctor and get your body fat, mass index and other parameters measured. Sometimes we think we need to gain weight but medically you don't need it. It is certainly not worth risking your health just to correct a perceived, but unreal "problem". Also, there are medical reasons for not gaining weight such as parasites or thyroid problems that can be treated.<br>  <br>  If you do need to gain weight, I recommend seeing a nutritionist. They will give you a meal plan that includes more high calorie foods such as fats. Try to stick to healthy vegetable oils, that can be added to almost any food. Packing up on starches is also a good way to go.

The answer to having a good-looking body is to eat a healthy diet -- and it's worth noting that the World Health Organization believes that 2100 calories is the *minimum* needed to be considered anything other than **starving**.  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of reasons you may be bulky, but I guarantee you beyond any shadow of a doubt that your caloric intake is NOT one of them.  Your body literally cannot get all of the necessary nutrients (vitamins, minerals, cofactors, enzymes, essential protiens, essential fats, and water) from a 1000-calorie diet -- and supplementing with any over-the-counter multivitamin won't suffice.  You should never, ever go on a diet less than 2100 calories without strict, constant medical supervision.<br>  <br>  If you want to sculpt your body, you need to eat right.  That means eat whole foods, avoid flour and sugar and anything and *everything* that contains them, and eat a rainbow of different colors of fruit and vegetables every day.  You need 40% protien, 30% carbohydrates, and 30% fat, and almost every single one of those carbs should come from fruit and vegetables.  Your protein and your fat should come from animal meat, dairy products, seeds, and nuts and it should be consumed as close to raw as is medically allowable. <br>  <br>  Avoid literally everything that has even a single ingredient that you cannot find somewhere in your store.  (For example, no matter how hard you try, you cannot buy a bag of BHA or sodium tetrachoride, so you shouldn't eat anything that has those ingredients in them.)  *Exceptions*: You can buy a bag of MSG -- Monosodium Glutamate -- but you should avoid anything that has that as an ingredient anyway.  Ditto aspartame, sucralose (Splenda), and soy anything.  The first three are neurotoxins that will harm your brain, and soy protein has so much estrogen in it that it can seriously harm your sexual development.<br>  <br>  So, in short: eat when you're hungry, don't eat flour or sugar, eat whole foods.<br>  <br>  Oh, that, and exercise regularly.

lLwoXPq0aa	Huni that sounds completely normal, Birth control takes over your hormones and your period etc, and it takes time for you body to configure whats going on and get back on to cycle. When you first start on birth control, you shouldnt really expect normal periods at normal intervals for about 3 months. Your body is trying to adjust, thats all.  Dont be suprised if it takes a while, and you dont have alot of blood either, chances are the birth control will reduce that.  Just relax, and enjoy not having a period for a change. You're a virgin, so you're not pregnant - your body is just taking time to sort itself out.  If you dont get it in a couple of weeks, go see the doctor again. They will keep changing the pill until they find the perfect one for you.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	I'm sorry, but you DON'T have anxiety because you are concerned (i.e. love) your husband.  How sweet of you to care for him!      I can almost guarantee that the reason he got dizzy is because he skipped breakfast.  Please read the books (links provided) below and you will understand how this can happen.      I ate poorly for 4-5 years of my life (although I tended to skip lunch, not breakfast), and I PAID for it later on.  It took me two years of staying on top of eating healthy to "fix" the problem.  I would get dizzy often, being unable to drive myself home from work.  I didn't understand why.  I'm sure your husband has "felt fine" doing this for some time.  However, the body will "rebel" against this sort of thing at some point.  Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  It's great he eats it once he gets to work, but he should have something in his tummy before leaving home (an egg sandwich, a fried egg & toast, some grapefruit on the side).  Always include a good protein w/ his breakfast (egg and/or sausage, cottage cheese, chicken, etc.).    I still get this way if I eat breakfast late or if I only eat cereal (which will cause a sugar "crash").|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	You need to see a doctor about yourself.

fk9AvB25aa	He probably doesn't know that he could have herpes. A lot of people don't know they have herpes until they have an out break or were diagnosed with herpes. I was freaked out when I started having some pain down there, then I had blisters all over down there and I had no idea what they were. I got them tested the next time they broke out and turns out it was herpes.  Herpes usually takes between 2-14 days to show any symptoms but herpes could take longer then that to show symptoms because your body can suppress it for months even years after you contracted it.  You had very little contact with him, plus he didn't have an out break at the time. This means he is less contagious but there is still a small chance that he could pass herpes on.  Look up the symptoms for herpes and if you think your having any of them then get tested for herpes.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	even if he gave you herpes, you could go years without an outbreak, that is the nature of herpes, it lies dormant for a long time, so people can pass it around without even knowing they have it, thus the need to be very careful and use protection ALWAYS.

Thats a symtem of herpes starting. Itching where u were infected & then fluid filled bumps.|`|DURtl8x6aa	This is from WebMD:    Let's say you have an infected male and an uninfected female. If they avoid sex during outbreaks, don't use condoms regularly, and don't take antiviral therapy every day, the risk of tranmission is about 10% per year. But if you add condoms, it reduces transmission by about 50%, if he takes Valtrex 500 mg once a day, he can reduce transmission also by about another 50%. So you can see that the numbers get very low!     If it is a woman infected with HSV 2 having sex with an uninfected male, given the circumstances listed above again, then the transmission rate is about 4% prior to the interventions of condoms and Valtrex.     Which interventions are appropriate and desirable are decisions that individual couples makes, based on concerns about infection.

UZxeBrxQaa	The first answer was worthy of being ignored.    Don't worry about mercury in flu shots.  You consume mercury every time you eat fish.  Relax.    Does the flu shot prevent death?  Yes, it does, in older individuals and young people.  If you have ever had influenza, the kind where your temperature is 104 degrees, severe head pain, body aches, chills, muscle spasms, and you are too weak to stand for seven to 10 days, then you can understand the suffering this injection can prevent.      The simple fact is, older people succumb to this disease quite frequently, because of other unrelated health problems being aggravated.  If you have coronary heart disease, for instance, it often doesn't take much to push you over the edge.|`|84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	NO, absolutely not.  In fact, it has contributed to many diseases and caused the flu, as well as damage people's immune systems.  Become educated, not indoctrinated by people that do NOT have your best health interest at heart.    Start your education by watching this DVD that is free on line. You have to get by the brief introduction on the film to get it to run without stopping frequently; once you get by it, it moves very well and is a good DVD.    http://www.republicbroadcasting.org/inde...    It is more common to have bad reactions than not to have a reaction.    Another influenza season is beginning, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will strongly urge Americans to get a flu shot. In fact, the CDC mounts a well-orchestrated campaign each season to generate interest and demand for flu shots. But a recent study published in the October issue of the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine found that vaccinating young children against the flu appeared to have no impact on flu-related hospitalizations or doctor visits during two recent flu seasons.    At first glance, the data did suggest that children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years derived some protection from vaccination in these years. But after adjusting for potentially relevant variables, the researchers concluded that "significant influenza vaccine effectiveness could not be demonstrated for any season, age, or setting" examined.  Additionally, a Group Health study found that flu shots do not protect elderly people against developing pneumonia -- the primary cause of death resulting as a complication of the flu. Others have questioned whether there is any mortality benefit with influenza vaccination. Vaccination coverage among the elderly increased from 15 percent in 1980 to 65 percent now, but there has been no decrease in deaths from influenza or pneumonia.  There is some evidence that flu shots cause Alzheimers disease, most likely as a result of combining mercury with aluminum and formaldehyde. Mercury in vaccines has also been implicated as a cause of autism.     Three other serious adverse reactions to the flu vaccine are joint inflammation and arthritis, anaphylactic shock (and other life-threatening allergic reactions), and Guillain-Barr syndrome, a paralytic autoimmune disease. One credible hypothesis that explains the seasonal nature of flu is that influenza is a vitamin D deficiency disease.     There are three major reasons why this government push to vaccinate 84 percent of the U.S. population with a yearly flu vaccine is so incomprehensible:     1. The majority of flu shots contain 25 micrograms of mercury; an amount considered unsafe for anyone weighing less than 550 pounds! And which groups are most sensitive to the neurological damage that has been associated with mercury? Infants, children, and the elderly.    2. No studies have conclusively proven that flu shots prevent flu-related deaths among the elderly, yet this is one of the key groups to which theyre pushed.    3. If you get a flu shot, you can still get the flu (or flu-like symptoms). This is because it only protects against certain strains, and its anyones guess which flu viruses will be in your area. So why would you take a flu shot  EVERY YEAR -- that has NEVER been proven to be effective, that can give you the very illness youre trying to prevent, and has potential long-term side effects that are far worse than the flu itself?     The powers that be have done an excellent job of instilling fear into the population so they believe that they must get a shot to stay healthy, but the simple reality is its doing you more harm than good. And, even if the flu vaccine could effectively prevent the flu, there have been several examples in past years where government health officials have chosen the incorrect influenza strains for that years vaccine. In 2004, the National Vaccine Information Center described how CDC officials told everyone to line up for a flu shot that didn't even contain the influenza strain causing most of the flu that year. Two-Thirds of This Years Flu Vaccines Contain a Full-Dose of Mercury According to Dr. Donald Miller, MD, two-thirds of this years flu vaccines contain 25 micrograms of thimerosal. Thimerosal is 49 percent mercury by weight. Each dose of these flu vaccines contains more than 250 times the Environmental Protection Agencys safety limit for mercury.     In addition to mercury, flu vaccines also contain other toxic or hazardous ingredients like:     ? Formaldehyde -- a known cancer-causing agent   ? Aluminum -- a neurotoxin that has been linked to Alzheimers disease   ? Triton X-100 -- a detergent   ? Phenol (carbolic acid)   ? Ethylene glycol (antifreeze)   ? Various antibiotics: neomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin  which can cause allergic reactions in some people     Know that theres plenty of scientific evidence available to back up the recommendation to avoid flu vaccines  if nothing else, then for the simple reason that they dont work, and dont offer any real benefit to offset their inherent health risks. For example:     ? A brand new study published in the October issue of the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine found that vaccinating young children against the flu had no impact on flu-related hospitalizations or doctor visits during two recent flu seasons. The researchers concluded that "significant influenza vaccine effectiveness could not be demonstrated for any season, age, or setting" examined.  ? A study published in the Lancet just two months ago found that influenza vaccination was NOT associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia in older people. This supports a study done five years a|`|j2SDmDHPaa	The first poster is sort of..... dumb, and clearly a very biased person.  I would assume that something flu-related has happened to them or someone close to them, unfortunate, but still no reason to turn into Michael Moore on the topic of flu-shots.      Anyway, I'm not sure if the introduction of flu-shots has  significantly decreased deaths, but i can assure you they do at least some good.  Look up flu-related deaths in the US prior to flu-shots (i'm sure the info is out there), and then look up the deaths for the years following the introduction.  And look for a trend yourself, don't rely on an article or video presented by a biased source.    Flu shots are not the root of all evil, the first poster stated in one of their 3 points that most flu shots contain 25 micrograms of mercury, however the evidence presented later indicates 12.5 micrograms of mercury, because mercury is only 1/2 the weight of whatever that substance was.

If there is something going on that your body is dealing with, increased nutrition can help your body to better cope & in some cases even reverse the symptoms. Increase your water consumption while decreasing caffeine & juice consumption. Take a walk around the block after supper or walk up & down your stairs several times each day as a way of getting some form of gentle exercise.

Men have the ability to orgasm each time they have a sexual encounter, as long as they reach the climax that allows them to ***.  For women it's not the case and there is a little more involved.  Let me assure you that when you have one, you will know.  In the mean time there are several things you can do to help you reach that state of bliss.    A) Explore your body.  You are the only one who really knows what feels good and what doesn't.  Explore your own body and find your G-Spot.  Then when with partner gently direct him to the things you like and make you feel good.  B) Read books on vaginal exercises, positions ect. They can help you find these areas.    Don't worry about not having had one.  Most young men are just as inexperienced on how to give pleasure to their partner. But when the day comes, you will know.|`|scX6smKVaa	when you have one then you will know you have had one!|`|SZFyKlWzaa	oh, you'll know. you'll tingle from head to toe and feel AMAZING.

All of that, and you are also a new parent.    No, don't circumcise him.      It's mutilation, and will damage his penis, decrease his enjoyment of sex.    It's abnormal and unnatural, also.

I wouldn't get my child circumcised because it's not my place. I believe that no parent has teh right to make that choice for anyone else but themselfs.  Are you happy you have all the genitilia you were born with? Or do you wish some of it was cut off?    I don't care what people "say" about circumcision. I want a foreskin, I want to be as my God made me and no way else.    There is no reason for circumcision. The only reson is for personal reasons and only your son can know what those reasons are.    If I were you I would leave him as he was born, and protect his rights as a human being. Let him make the choice on what to do with his own body.    Circumcision also reduces sexual feeling greatly. I am restoring my foreskin and I can tell you that circumcision DOES greatly reduce sexual feeling. If your husband were to find out what he was missing out on in the bedroom, he would think circumcision is child abuse and he wouldn't let it happen to his baby boy.    I personaly think this isa human rights issue and no one has the right to make a choice like this for someone else. I don't care if they are parents or not, that doesn't mean you can do what ever you want to your child.  You are sapposed to protect him and his body, and protect his right to a choice.    I wish my mother did.    It doesn't matter what you or your husband wants, it's about what he wants, and right now he doesn't have the ability to get a vote. so wait till he can have his vote. I can gaurentee you he will chose to stay intact when he get's older.    I'm just going to voice my own opinion and don't get offended because I'm just stating how I personaly see the situation.  I don't think it's right that parents take this decision upon themselfs, and the child has to go through severe traumatising pain, and watch all of this happening, for something they didn't get a vote on. They are sitting there going through all of this, when it might be something they will hate forever. Something that mightbe precious to them it being taken from them.  To me it just seems like parents are taking advantage of their power. These little babies are just born and don'thave the right to speak or take care of themselfs, and parents take advantage of that time to force what they want on their child before he can say no.  It just doesn't seem right to me.  I thought parents were saposed to prevent people from doing that to their babies, not pay someone to do it.    Idk but that's just how I see all of that.    I hope you keep your baby boy intact.  A mother once told me (when I asked her about circumcision) "I carried my baby boy for 9 months, I hoped and I prayed durring that whole time, that he would be born perfect and healthy.... and he was"  I wish my mother had thought that.    -Connor|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Advantages ? Compliance to religious tradition; same appearance as "Dad"; desensitized penis may allow for "lasting longer during sex" Disadvantages? Unnecessary pain; desensitizes penis - less enjoyment;  less variety of "activities during sex;  Do you REALLY want to know why they "push" circumcision ?  Ask the doctor if you can "keep" the excised skin. They won't allow it - because they get BIG bucks for it to use with skin grafting - THAT is why they push it. No kidding.|`|4arnbpUCaa	My research on circumcision led me to conclude that it is an unnecessary procedure, and that it permanently removes a natural and important part of the boy's penis.    The American Medical Association supports the American Academy of Pediatrics' statement that the evidence "is not sufficient to recommend routine circumcision." They add that "it is not essential to the child's wellbeing."    The below websites may be of interest to you.    Oh, and I just saw your Q&A, that you want to be a Buddhist monk. Buddhists do not believe in circumcision, so that might be something you should consider too.|`|3UQrUNMSaa	Hygiene is a cornerstone of modern civilization. We all know that people living in the period of time between the end of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the modern age were not particularly concerned with washing. Some saw washing as an unnecessary luxury, others saw it as the first step toward sinning by indulging the pleasures of flesh. Some doctors even claimed that bathing was harmful to the body or the mind.    Time has passed and mankind entered a new age. Nowadays many people wash every day and dont seem to suffer any of the side effects predicted by the doctors of less scientifically advanced times. Still, we cant really say that everybody on earth is fully aware and practicing the strictest personal hygiene. Of course, social pressure takes care of most problems, since men and women would feel too embarrassed if they were found wanting on personal hygiene.    However, while many people pay little attention to it, intimate hygiene is just as important as overall hygiene. The sex organs are more sensitive than other parts of the body and frequently engaged in intimate contact, which is why they should be as clean as possible, if not cleaner. Think about it. The last thing you want when you take a lady to bed is to discover that shes not a hygiene fan. Its a major turnoff and it works the same way for both partners.    To clean the penis start at the tip. Pull the foreskin back as far as it would go in order to expose the entire glans. Wash both the glans and the inside of the foreskin thoroughly, but gently. This is not supposed to cause pain, so be gentle with one of the most sensitive parts of your body. At the same time make sure that the glans is perfectly clean. The space between the glans and the foreskin is where the white substance known as smegma is formed.    Smegma is a mixture of dead epithelial cells shed by tissues, skin oils, moisture and bacteria. Since bacteria tend to thrive in any small place that has plenty of moisture, be sure to wash away all smegma from under the foreskin. Letting bacteria and dead tissue cells accumulate is a sure way of getting every womans nightmare: a smelly penis.    This could easily destroy a relationship, since no woman would accept to live with a man who doesnt know or care to keep himself clean. Going down on a man whose penis smells is simply out of the question. Intimate hygiene is also important for penis enlargement. Using an enlargement device such as a traction device or a pump on an unclean penis will simply spread bacteria all over the penis.    Accumulated dirt, sweat and bacteria will certainly cause infections at one point or another in the future. Men who engage in penis enlargement exercises are also exposed to infections if they fail to maintain a high standard of intimate hygiene. That why warming up and down using hot water in the shower is recommended as a good way of preparing for a penis enlargement session and as a chance to clean the penis.    Circumcised men have to be even more careful about their intimate hygiene because they lack the foreskin that protects the sensitive glans from sweat, dust and all manner of substances that should not come into contact with the penis. Some men choose circumcision precisely because they think that losing the foreskin helps keep the penis clean.    However, there is an ongoing debate among experts about the hazards and benefits of circumcision. Many doctors say that removing the protective foreskin is less hygienic and exposes the glans to various bacteria that cause infections of the urinary tract. At the same time, other doctors maintain that the foreskin traps smegma and dirt and so, uncircumcised men are not spared the danger of infections.    Regardless of how you feel about circumcision, one thing is perfectly clear: hygiene, and especially intimate hygiene, is of the utmost importance to you. It keeps infections away from this sensitive area and makes sure that your sexual relationships will not suffer.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	No. Let him make the decision later in life.  Teach him how to clean it just as you would teach him to clean his ears - not teaching him is the mistake that parents make which leads to infection and the like.    Trust me, girls do not have issues with intact guys and there is no higher risk of infection as long as he's hygenic.|`|l5O6CTzJaa	I'd circumsize only if your son has phimosis or a really tight foreskin.  The answer by Michael T is the best so far.  As for calling circumcision "mutilation" - IMO that that is a bit extreme.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	It's all preference. If you are Jewish, American, then sure.  People who say it damages the penis are idiots, the nerve that is used for "activities" is not at all damaged. In fact many cases of circumcision don't even draw blood.  More and more people are, there are no huge pros or cons to it. Nobody who is confident is going to care, and no woman he meets should care either, otherwise she's only concerned about his appearance and not his character.  Do whatever you want, I'm going to get my son (should i have one) circumcised.  And in case in the future he's insecure, there is new stuff that can grow skin or whatever, by the time he's grown enough i wouldn't doubt if they could completely reverse it if he wanted.  No real pros or cons, healthy? Who wouldn't wash their penis?  Looks? As if some skin makes a huge difference.  It isn't that painful. It isn't mutilation. A circumcised penis is NOT dry and crusty or whatever some other poster said.  Oh also, some people say that a circumcised penis loses feeling because it isn't protected by the skin, this is false. It's like saying your index finger will lose feeling if you don't wear a glove on it almost all the time. A nerve is a nerve.  Congrats on the birth of you son.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.    Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?    Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/  http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2... (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)    You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...    You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)    Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....  http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...    Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...    The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. http://www.icgi.org/    It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA    Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?  Gomco Clamp- http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

Diaper changes were easy, teaching them proper hygiene was easy, and the best excuse I ever heard from a mom for circumcising is not wanting to clean stray drops of urine off the toilet rim and floor!  LMAO  Let me tell you, EVERY boy leaves "strays" regardless of penis status.    Yes, like any other functioning part of the body, occasionally the foreskin develops a problem-- but choosing to remove it to prevent that is no different than pulling your teeth to prevent cavities or lopping off your feet to prevent athlete's foot. Yes, it's effective, but it's like using a sledgehammer as a flyswatter. It costs more than it saves.    ~Laura|`|DqbJ9RaZaa	Are you a jew? If so, go ahead! If not, dont even think about it. Circumcision is the product of a insane mind!|`|p5YkuM92aa	Yes you should.  My brother was not circumsized and I was.  I've had a great sex life and he is almost asexual!|`|AA10096628	here is all you'll need    http://norm.org/    personal answer:    NO!!!!    why would you do that to a perfectly normal penis!! it was born the way it was made to be...   it's painful, just because he is a baby doesn't mean he wont feel the pain...  barbaric! not necessary! the best thing you can do is educate yourself, and like showing him how to brush his teeth and clean his ear, just teach him to keep it clean! it's no big deal! Don't be shy about it, he is your son.     When he gets older he can make the decision himself but i assure you, he'll probably want to keep  his penis intact, why would you put yourself through that pain!|`|i2QUf6JMaa	no way dude leave him natural - my opinion|`|qa5bMEkWaa	you should have your son circumcised. Honestly, they may get made fun of in school. I'm in high school and it's actually labeled as "weird" to be uncircumcised. Even though I disagree with that, other people won't. I know it seems like your hurting your child but your really not, it's over in a second, there's usually not penis damage. Although, go with your gut, but socially and with his first serious girlfriend it will be much easier when hes that old.|`|eDj78JH0aa	Leave him the way evolution intended it to be. If he wants too then its his choice not yours-in my opinion. I honestly don't know why this is even an issue any more. Leave his penis intact and he will thank you later on because you had the decency to do your research and not rely on false pretenses developed in the 1900's to prevent masturbation(in America). Originally it was saw as a punishment in Ancient Egyptian culture. So be smart and do yourself and your son a favor and make the educated decision.|`|AA11587429	Either way he'll be fine.  There are pros and cons to both sides of the coin.      Being circumcised when nobody else is would be uncomfortable.  It would equally be uncomfortable to have a foreskin when nobody else does.  I'd find out what's more common where you live and choose that because it's always more comfortable to fit in with everyone else.     My two cents:  I'm circumcised and like it that way.  But I'm easy to please... I'd probably like having a foreskin too.
IlOjhe9Xaa	I have this. I don't know if it's due to my PCOS. However it isn't all nasty the way you think. Few strays here and there...and I actually have had quite a few women admit to me that they struggle with the same thing.    You see, women's bodies and systems are soooo much easier to get thrown out of whack...and much more delicate...so we go thru so many hormonal changes throughout life....Why do you care if a woman has this...? Unless it looks like a beard it shouldn't be a problem. Most women who have that are struggling with something hormonal like I am.|`|PeMpDAbraa	they do?? Holy **** I hope that never happens to me. Hormones I would guess.|`|YVVK3ELTaa	Some women have a little more testosterone in their genes than others (Testosterone is the gene which make a male male, although women have it too, but not as much) It could also possibly be a syndrome called PCOS. xx|`|96mkEwkwaa	I think that all women have hair on their chest to a point...i have peach fuzz, you cant see it unless you're really close and it is very light and soft.|`|jeztbF6naa	how old are these women?  and this usually occurs in teens when there starting there period. i wouldn't think there should be a lot just like tiny hairs i dont know how to answer this clearly..|`|oy7mNHJNaa	Genetics, horomone imbalance, there are many reasons that can cause an excess of hair.|`|xcJn4pfGaa	Hair only grows there on young women who arent fully developed in fact it happens to ALL teenage girls.
GawVIf3paa	Anxiety disorder CAN be treated and do not let anyone convince you otherwise; once u been through therapy for it, you will learn how to control your anxiety and/or panic attack.....they do go hand-in-hand together.  <br>  When I decided to go to therapy for it, I learned that it started way back in my life even before I was 12 yrs old.  At that time in my life, I did not know the feeling I had was called Anxiety and Panic attacks.<br>  I can safely say that when I do see  an anxiety coming and before it gets to be annoying and bothersome, I am able to control it and reverse that scary feeling....<br>  I do understand what u are going through.<br>  So, do something positive for your own peace of mind and do seek help: a psychologist, specialist in anxiety and panic attacks etc.<br>  I was lucky , my treatment was covered by insurance.<br>  Good luck, chin up and trust yourself!<br>  Do check this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.healthsquare.com/anxiety3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthsquare.com/anxiety3.htm</a>|`|qXCgeye3aa	if you start taking meds, you will for the rest of your life, they are like sedatives. just try to stay clam...relax, dont take everything to heart. you only have one life. make some time for yourself, to do a hobby, or go like horseback riding, enjoy the outdoors, take a hour walk in the park, you can over come it naturally.|`|cN3wbUdoaa	You can't. Most people are born with it and is just something your gonna have to accept =/|`|cASB8Sh3aa	you may needs meds and/or therapy.  Cognitive behavior therapy works wonders for anxiety issues and depending on your level of anxiety, it may be enough to just get that.  Plus it doesn't take long to start feeling less anxiety with these techniques so you get a pretty quick fix.  Talk to your doctor right away.  Please don't self medicate with alcohol, drugs, or sleeping pills as these will just make the anxiety worse.|`|ClZWgDoxaa	See a doctor (psychiatrist) or a therapist. They will know if you need any meds.. That will usually fix an anxiety.

Most of them don't care about their appearance as much as girls do. I know from personal experience because I'm a recovering anorexic. The media can be a cause of anorexia because of all the female celebrities are known to be beautifully gorgeous and thin. Not only the media causes anorexia, but also earlier childhood. For example, what cause my anorexia was my parents. I used to be a little chubby when I was like 7 years old and my parents would always call me fatty and enroll me in athletic activities. This caused me later on to be more careful about what I eat and cause the calorie counting obsession along with the compulsive exercise. MOST girls get emotional when their parents complain about their appearance. That's why MOST guys don't really care because guys aren't as emotional as girls are. A guy can take a mean compliment as if it were a piece of cake, but it's not like that for girls. A girl can take an impolite compliment like a bullet through their flesh. But not all guys are like that. There are SOME guys who deeply worry about what others think of them. That can also lead to anorexia. Also, there are more girls with low self esteem than guys. There are many reasons why, but the main reason is because girls are much more emotional than guys are.     ~Mehh (:|`|NREqhragaa	.. cause girls think they need to be skinny as other girls... but i guess boys just dont give a crap about it. P: o.o|`|AA11404742	Guys don't usually get anorexia.  But they more likely develop a related disorder, and turn into gym rats.  You know the ones - they are excessively obsessed with their level of fitness, and may spend hours a day working out.|`|3qLIRorjaa	There's a lot more than you think. When i was doing part of my PhD, i had to work alongside my professor and study the psychological effects of eating disorders/body dysmorphia.    About 60% of the patients were male, but in society it's known as a female problem, so a lot of males suffer in silence for fear of being ridiculed.|`|W9VLXTfpaa	well, its simple.  Girls have more issues with their appearance, and alot of guys dont really give a ****. The girls that are anorexic are just girls that either just plainly dont eat ENOUGH, or think they are too fat and are dumbasses. I mean honestly anorexia isnt cute at alllllll.
88a821ff156d404073518f9a8da929c6aa	I don't think religion really has to come in to it.  Any mentions of prayers or heaven is just alluding to her death and probably a tricky conversation topic.  Just thank her for what you'd like to and tell her you'll look after her son.  I'm not religious  either but you can still play a part in comforting her and the family.    After all we don't actually know what happens next might be something,might be nothing but that's a conversation for another time.    Good luck.|`|AA12212523	Perhaps you should put kindness and concern for someone who is dying ahead of your own feelings.

And I am a person of high integrity. But when a Stage 4 cancer patient recently told me she would pray for me, I said "I will too."    You don't get extra points for being true to your convictions in situations like this. You get them for compassion.    Say whatever she wants to hear or that will comfort her ... it's her last few days on earth.|`|KmH3AsbZaa	First of all you need to realize that it doesn't matter your religion death comes to us all and is a law of this world. If you wish to comfort her let her know that you are always going to be there for her son. you will always love him and do everything possible to make his life better. She will thank you for it and it will make the passing a little easier. if that doesn't please you just try to say something based on her personality you know would make her feel even a little bit relieved.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	then you should say nothing because you don't believe in anything.but if you have to say something ask her what you get in the will.atheists are sencable people and dosent let sentiment get in they way of anything.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	There is no difference between religious and non religious ones at those moments .For religious customs you can hire a pastor or nun to comfort her.For reducing her pain ,what you should talk -that doesnot depend on religion.Since you are non religious ,you are thinking that it will play a major role.Actually you can ask her about her opinions and what advices she will give to forthcoming generations .That  may comfort her|`|aXYiOskmaa	there really aren't any comforting words to offer. religious or not. she knows what's happening and nothing will change it. i've lost 3 immediate family members to cancer and the best thing i've found is not to talk but to listen. she most likely has things she wants to say but no one wants to hear it cause it hurts too much. they change the subject and such. let her talk, ask her if there is anything she wants you to do for her. these are things that may bring comfort to her. it may be easier for her to say certain things to you because you aren't her child.  i hoped this helped at least a little|`|FdVCQqzzaa	if she is a religious person then you don't have to worry about what to say to her. she already knows whats going to happen when she dies maybe talk to her about how shes influenced you're life what kind of things you will remember about her etc.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	Maybe what you just realized is that as a person without hope, you have no hope to offer at all.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	You have some fatty acid deficiencies going on.  The baby requires a lot of saturated and monounsaturated fats to properly develop it's nervous system.  Most likely you were told to reduce your fat consumption by the ignorant.  Children need fat to develop properly and mother's milk is natures most perfect food, but if you are deficient in these fats, the milk will not be what it should be and the baby's demand on you will make you more deficient.    Stress plays a big part in this as well.  The precursor pregnenalone is required to make the sex hormones, but it also is required to make cortisol, the stress hormone in your adrenal glands.  Fat is required to make pregnenalone.  Our genetics have only changed about 0.1% in the last 12,000 years and so we are much like our ancestors.  When a sabor tooth tiger was chasing a person through the camp, the first thing needed was more energy to the muscles to run.  This didn't happen very often, but when it did, the stress of this caused the body to produce high amounts of cortisol.  The adrenal glands were called into action and a "pregnenalone steal" happened.  All the pregnenalone went to making cortisol and guess what, sex was the last thing on that person's mind;  the liver reprioritized to deal with the stess so no estrogen was reconjugated and all the pregnenalone went to making the cortisol, leaving the sex hormones not to be made.    Exhausted adrenal glands happen, especially to people that do not get at least 5 hours uninterrupted sleep at night so you can go into a good REM sleep mode.  It takes 29 hours for the adrenals to recharge once they have been abused due to stress.      Babies need about 55% fat in their diet as infants and then over the next years of their lives, that % should decrease on a sliding scale to about 30% by the time they are 18.  It's very important to understand to avoid ALL VEGETABLE OILS because they are very inflammatory and NOT good for you at all;  AT ALL.      Contrary to what you have been indoctrinated to believe, things like butter and coconut oil is very good for you and bad oils like vegetable oils (especially soybean, canola, cottonseed, and corn oils), hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils, trans fats, margarines of all kinds are all terrible for you.     Make a mixture of:  1/3 olive oil, 1/3 sesame seed oil, and 1/3 coconut oil and use that for all your cooking and salads.  I add balsamic vinegar to the oil mix to make a great salad dressing.  Commercial salad dressings are horrible for you.    There are some supplements you can take to assist you in this process as well as the diet changes, but you don't have to suffer with this problem.  E-mail me for more information if you like.    good luck to you|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|qKA05EQTaa	http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/low_lib...                         here are some home remedies

Stress and worry can cause aches and pains. Learn to relax and cultivate an attitude of "I don't give a crap".|`|RJY6aRQ9aa	I'm stressed out over money now. Not because I've less of it but because I've more going out of my hands. I got a car so had to pay over 1100 on tax and insurance alone. A few things also need to be fixed on it so that's another few hundred, one person quoted me 300 for the work alone, not the parts.  Rent its going to be late this month.    I'm not as stressed as I was last summer, was doing a job that took longer than expected and didn't have much time to finish it. I got so stressed that my body just stopped working properly, I ignored it but the last day of work I could hardly even walk, I couldn't bend over and I also really needed to go to the toilet but couldn't.

Also, our house is very old, and the kitchen and bathroom have not been remodelled since 1950 and no matter how much I clean, they look dirty, things are broken, tiles are missing, etc.  But we have no money to fix it like it needs to be fixed.|`|7mhqRhJKaa	Stress is very destructive.    Get clear in your own mind what it is you are really worrying about.     Then ask yourself  "What is the absolutely worst thing that can possibly happen if what I am worrying about occurs"    It won't seem nearly as bad once you do this.  Then you can stop worrying about it.
HqS6TiiQaa	well if its an "infection" you need antibiotics. If your nose is stopped up, use plenty of tissue and keep blowing it. Its the mucus left in the sinuses that cause an infection. DO NOT sniffle, blow. Use lots of nose spray to help keep the cavities clear. Other than this...it has to run its course. Try zicam or day quail. good luck|`|oojO4WAraa	Drink LOTS of water to thin the mucus and take lots of vitamin C to kill the germs.      Take a big nose hit off an onion or some garlic.

(He died of emphysema and COPD  and diabetes caused by smoking).  <br>  <br>  Second hand smoke is almost as dangerous to your health as smoking.<br>  <br>  Nag your folks to quit.  Stay in your room (windows open if you have to) or go outside and avoid them whenever they smoke and tell them why.<br>  <br>  Tell your teachers.  Tell your doctor.  Tell your minister or rabbi.  Start a whispering campaign that your folks are "abusing" you with second-hand smoke.  Get "sick" a lot and blame it on the smoke. Puke on the rug.  <br>  <br>  Ask your folks if you can go live with your grandparents. Threaten to move out the day you turn 18.<br>  <br>  In short, make this a really big deal.

Everythime I go out partying in other states, for example Niedersachsen (where smoking is not allowed in bars) it is amazing how fresh the air is and how little my clothes smell of smoke the next morning. <br>  <br>  Most people who I know who grow up as second-hand smokers or people who smoke are not bothered by the smell. Some people just never get used to it.|`|33E71Ka3aa	You can not get use to the smell sweetie. Just stay away from the smoke. Try to talk to family members about smoking outside tell them of all the good things about smoking outside the home. Like for example it creates better air inside the home, the carpet, walls, clothes, curtains. Try to make an area of the home smoke free. See if they can agree on designating smoking areas and make sure they stay in that area.|`|Q1bQAqfRaa	I'm surprised your not accustomed to the smell.|`|RUf73hG1aa	If you are not used to it by now, what is the point?  You have been around it all you life, you should be used to it by now.  Kinda sucks for you to not have a choice about being around it, but just don't start yourself.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Don't force yourself to get used to it. Actually, I don't think you could if you tried anyway. Is your family smoking inside the house? Ask them politely to smoke outside. Tell them it's not fair that you have to be exposed to second hand smoke and that you could die from lung cancer at a young age when you have chosen to live a cigarette-free life. Print out some information from websites regarding second-hand smoke, lung cancer, changing smoking habits, quitting smoking, all kinds of things and start handing them out to your family members on a regular basis. They'll know how serious you are, they'll get tired of it, and maybe they'll comply. It's worth a try. You could try going outside when somebody is smoking, if they're smoking in the house. You could also use air fresheners to help get rid of the smell. Sorry, that's the best I can do. Hope that helps. Good luck and take care. This is a really serious issue and you need to relay that to your family!
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	It sounds like ringworm.|`|37evQRaDaa	Sounds like ringworm.  You can get rid of it by applying patchouli essential oil daily.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	ring worms|`|fZrPu4jbaa	you NEED TO take her to the doctor she probably has ring worm|`|ZVE3N57xaa	Most will jump to an automatic assumption of ringworm however its important to do a little digging.  Ringworm is not in fact a worm but a fungal infection.  Ringworm is contracted by touching pets, animals or people or the hair of animals which contain the spores of dermatophyte fungi.  Has your child been exposed to animals or perhaps does she attend day care?    Ringworm is effectively treated with topical anti-fungal creams and perhaps a supplemental anitbiotic.  The area being treated should be covered until resolution is observed.  As an aside if you believe that pets are the source you will need to see your vet and treat them as well.    Separately your child may not have ringworm but in fact may have Pityriasis Rosea.  This is a scaly skin condition which is most often observed in children or young adults and can mimic the appearance of Ringworm.  Pityriasis Rosea is often characterized initially by a single scaly red patch ( a Herald Spot or Patch).  The cause is unknown, it could be viral or bacterial.  This rash usually lasts 1 to 3 months, rarely comes back and is not contagious.  Treatment includes over the counter antihistimine to decrease the itch or your doctor may prescribe a course of mild steroids.    In either instance you should see your pediatrician.    Hope this helps.  C

When you write what you've ate you can see where your going wrong (if you are)     Hope this helps|`|bit5P4Dwaa	go to your doctor and see if he will prescribe you weight gain foods.  but if not just be happy with what you look like....i'm sure many people would kill to have your figure.
NUc6Aw9Gaa	Some people have cancer for a while before it gets so bad that they notice it.<br>  <br>  It's a shame but unfortunately that's the way it is sometimes. it truly sux|`|MJt1xeQ7aa	i know its so tragic , im so sad over this and wish so much something could be done to at least prolong her life for some years , i heard her cancer was due to stress, yeh i dont understand either how the doctors didnt notice it but can see as some of those medics dont do anything until someone is dying , thats how the nhs seems to work|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	One of the reasons cancer is so deadly in adolescents and young adults is because they are healthy enough to ignore and live with symptoms for a long, long time. Cancer can co-exist quite nicely in a healthy body, it isn't a foreign object it is your own DNA. The body treats cancer just like it is another organ. It isn't until cancer becomes very advanced when a patient begins to show outward signs of being ill. This is very common. Most young people do not know until the cancer is advanced and by than it is too late.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, young people just never think that they might have cancer and tend to ignore early warning signs . . one of the more common types of cancer in young people is a sarcoma which is a cancer of the bone, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and soft tissue anywhere in the body . . the only warning sign is an unexplained, painless lump or bump that seems to be growing . . it can be located anywhere  . . have it checked if it is over 2cm and getting bigger.|`|OPrgBGAjaa	i now some <br>  body that has the same cancer and she is fighting it right now they did not spot she had cancer for 5 years she kept ignoring the letters to go for a smear then she finaly went and she was told she has cancer she had no symtoms nothing she has been going on holiday to spain , mexico and other places all you women out there please,please go for your smears as you can see they are very important they can save your life

53b873dc19210bd9e4fae22faf08dc69aa	That's good that you are seeing your dr.  It sounds stress related which can lead you to feel anxious.  Having full responsibility for the bills now that roommate has moved out, working 50 hrs. a week plus the job insecurity that so many people are facing.  Talk to your dr. about ways to relieve stress.  If you can get a handle on it now it hopefully won't turn into major anxiety like I have now.  Make sure you take time to just relax every night even if it is for 10 mins.  Listen to soft music, learn to meditate, although I haven't mastered that.  It seems like you have a good handle on what is going on.  Just don't ignore the symptoms because it will only get worse.  Your body and mind has a way of making you aware of what it needs.  I think your on the right track with the dr.  The most important thing is to take care of yourself.  Get online and find ways that help with stress and relaxation when your anxious.  Hope things work out for you.

The hymen is the thing that causes pain when you lose your virginty.if your hymen is broken,  there may be a little bit of pain or discomfort, but there won't be any blood or anything. Also, try to use a lubricant, which will help things go more smoothly, and it won't feel as painful or uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK XOX <3|`|RhPNV1ohaa	Yes.  Frequently when a woman who gets a wedding license has to have a physical.  The doctor will frequently break the hymen then so the first time sex will not be so painful.  I wouldn't give away the marriage privilages too easily if I were you.|`|Jqve5UPlaa	It wouldn't hurt in the sense that someone would have to push through your hymen, but it probably would because the penis would have to fit in your vagina.<br>  xo.

BRDqfAy3aa	please read below - Causes of Irregular Periods|`|2LflHv23aa	I have always had irregular periods. It never really bothered me until I wanted to have a baby. A reason one might have irregular periods is a hormonal problem. I was diagnosed with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome. I have a slight hormonal problem but that can be fixed with birth control pills. I would call your doctor and see if they could run tests to make sure. <br>  After having my son my periods have pretty much stabalized.|`|AzPw1Z9Laa	It's normal for some people.  I did not have regular period during my teenage years up until i gave birth to my first girl when i was 26 yrs of age. Once my period skipped 2 months! (when I was 15). I was worried but my mom said it's okay.  Only after I gave birth, my period cycle changed and became regular but sometimes delay upto a week.<br>  Eating the right food and good balance diet makes a difference.<br>  Don't worry.|`|DgAOboZNaa	<a href="http://www.epigee.org/health/lateperiod.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/health/lateperiod....</a><br>  Everything you need to know.|`|vwvTldkoaa	this also happens to me.

No different than having sexual intercourse, just stimulating your penis with your hand instead of a vagina, so it is simply solo sex.|`|2QB90j85aa	you'll last longer in bed :)|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Too much masturbation?  I'm sorry, you've confused me...      The only problem you could see is that you might get too used to the way it feels (your hand can grip much tighter than *most* vaginas), meaning later on when you have sex you might have difficulty adjusting to the lighter pressure.    Solution:  Don't squeeze too tight!  Just hard enough to do the job!    Also, if you do it really often I guess you could rub it raw.  Proper lubrication should fix that.    The worst side effect is the computer viruses associated with porn sites.    Happy whacking!|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	There is no such thing as too much masturbation, except in the fantasies of fanatics.    You can make yourself sore for a few hours if you do it more times in a day than your body can stand, otherwise -- no effect at all.  If it does get sore, cut down repetitions by one a day, wait 24 hours and go on doing it.    You are wonderful as you are. Believe in yourself and love yourself (including your penis).

If it begins to interfere with normal function in day to day activities, then it is an obsession and needs to be curbed.    The only health problems you'll run into by masturbating is potential for dehydration. That is, unless you're doing it wrong; in which case for the love of god stop hurting yourself.    It can desensitize you as well, but that's more or less based on how you do it and whether or not you're circumcised.|`|66l0BPhaaa	too much masturbation equals too much sperm and seman all over the place. also, one of your arms will be huge. good work out.|`|3c606c504872e24f874ab51f4295f617aa	well its depriving some young lady lots of pleasure, rather share it than go solo and keep all the pleasures to yourself, but then again its safer sex, unless your hands have some or other bug on them.|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	nothing at all  read on the link it will clear all your myths about sex  http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-My...

If anything, he could probably ease your pain by coating your throat once again.    S|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You are what you eat.    If there is bacteria, or virus, on his member, you will ingest it, and possibly infect yourself if you have an open sore in your mouth and throat.  Otherwise, your digestive acids will destroy any bacteria or virus.    I wouldn't panic.  Wait to see if the problem resolves on its own in a day or two.  It could very well be unrelated to anything you have done.  Sometimes we just get sore throats.    Be sure your significant other understands the significance of cleanliness.  Take along some anti-bacterial wipes, and protect your self at least to that degree.  Better yet, use a protective covering.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Yes, although chances are usually not high, any "exchange of body fluids" can do it.|`|QLtPqPZ4aa	Yes you can get many of things.|`|qZ0310yVaa	yes it happened to me to with a women|`|RJY6aRQ9aa	If your boyfriend has an std, then I would say that's it.

Gw1LLzDgaa	1.  Stop the stupid, misplaced guilt.  There is nothing wrong with pornography, and it doesn't cause impotence.  Masturbation does so many good things for you that it is unhealthy NOT to do it.  Your guilt comes from being told early by someone that your penis was dirty -- it isn't.     2. If masturbating and looking at porn caused impotence, then all the men on earth would be impotent. Obviously that is not true.    You however combine unrealistic expectations with guilt to make a toxic cocktail.  Stop doing that.    You don't want comfort?  I'm not going to sit here and type out lies so you can feel more guilty.    1.  Most men do not maintain long term erections without contact.  2.  Porn is so popular because many men need that extra stimulation to get erect.  3.  Fantasy varies in its intensity -- not by how much porn you have watched, but by how good you are at imaging things.      Now then.  You are NOT impotent, if you can get erect, so get the language correct.  You simply are not as horny as some men.  The fact is, you can get erect, even if it takes contact to do it -- and you can penetrate -- by definition you are not impotent.    Stop believing that porn and masturbation are bad -- dump the guilt, and live.  Now then, could it "recover" if you stop masturbating and downloading porn?  It doesn't need to recover, there's nothing actually wrong.  I suppose the the placebo effect might temporarily cause a change, but it would not endure, and soon enough you would be as you are now, but you would have gotten rid of a little more of the pleasure and fun in your life in exchange.  If what you are really after is a way to feel guiltier and make yourself more miserable -- for whatever reasons -- then go for it -- but don't try to claim that its because you became impotent because of porn and jerking off.

P3MLLjCRaa	Borderline anorexic much?|`|5QQbJ9Cdaa	Honey you are thin enough.  Eating that will not only be unhealthy but in the long term it will not help keep a steady weight.  I suggest you eat healthy meals.  More fruits, veggies, whole grains, and water.|`|RZ4l6s65aa	you would lose 1-2 pounds at the start then around 1 pound every two days or so after  but trust me you do not need to lose weight|`|0b20b0537e9feba3149296180775b3dbaa	If you drank nothing but water and ate cabbage soup every day you would make yourself sick with gas and other things.    Try fruit, vegetables, salad and chicken. You need protein and fiber to stay healthy. Your body needs these nutrients in order to allow vitamins in your organs. You can munch on carrots, celery, apples if you feel like you are eating unhealthy but remember extreme dieting is not healthy, it can damage you body, organs and even make you feel tired. You don't state how old you are but it might be a good idea to talk to someone close to you that you trust; if you don't have someone like that, go to a school counselor, parent, or other trust worthy adult. Sometime talking about your image with other people can bring into perspective what is really bothering you.|`|cc4148580e3272438c188122840c3104aa	You will probably lose weight but you will not be fit or healthy.  You will feel week and maybe dizzy.  Don't even think about it.|`|iQNXZ1zdaa	That sounds foul. Anything you lose you will gain back once you stop the diet, since it'll slow your metabolism down to a crawl.    Stick with lots of fruit, vegetables, and grains, and eat a small amount every 3 hours or so, and your skin will be healthier, and you might actually enjoy eating.|`|njbmqjCTaa	I suppose. You'll probably sh*t alot though. And it's not a realistic diet, so therefore you'll gain it all back.|`|cTM6vQeBaa	It will make you lose weight, but you won't maintain the weightloss after you start eating normal again.

tnITO9F9aa	Do squats with medium weight and lots of reps. Sometimes ill do 100 reps of 145Lbs 50 25 25 of coarse u should use less weight and work up.

I like squats but it is more for muscle toning i think...muscles get bigger without cardio to lose fat everything gets bigger|`|IuVaXq1Daa	For your outer thighs:  -Squats (less weight more reps is best for slimming)  -Wall sit    For your inner thighs (this is usually where the fat is stored so this might be the exercise that's best if you want to be more toned):  -Get a pillow and put it between your thighs, then squeeze your thights together as hard as you can. Hold it for 10 seconds, repeat 10 times. If thats too easy then hold them for longer and do more reps.    When you exercise your muscles, they mucles will get stronger and the fat will be reduced, BUT it will get to a point when no more fat can taken away (there will always be a little bit fat there, but it's needed so I wouldn't worry about it, it's only a tiny amount) and this is when your muscles will begin to build up, so I wouldn't over do it if all you want to do is tone.    Take care :]|`|44a3b6241ed8dc74f350d1712228251aaa	gain the weight|`|qL8rsmEPaa	you should do legs lifts tredmil will help and so will squats|`|9cqdvno6aa	squats is the best workout for legs. Here is a good workout program(also my favourite) to tighten your thighs is to do 3 heavy sets of squat around 8-10 reps, right after that, do another 3 light sets around 18-20 reps. And then go on a bike for 30 mins ride.  Try it, it really burn the fat off your thighs.
P3MLLjCRaa	What program are you talking about? P90X?
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|KpoR3MiQaa	Eat healthy, starvation isnt the answer    Exercise|`|l9a8sFT7aa	Like you I have gained some weight and I do not want to gain anymore.

fbGv4iZ1aa	Our bodies have 3 sometimes 4 major growth stages the first 3 taking place between the ages of birth to 22.  Considering you said they really started growing about a year ago I would say you hit that  2nd  growth stage already.  Unless you are one of those who has one more stage of growth at around 21 then they probably wont get any bigger until pregnancy, or a large increase in weight can cause them to increase. In the last stage of growth our body decreases at around 45-60.  Our height, shoe size, hair thickness, weight, ring size, breast, ect. seem to decrease by up to 12%.  That is our final growth stage as far as big major stages our body makes.  Be happy I was a DD until I got sick and lost 70 lbs. now I am a C and much happier but they still sag.  I would love to be an a. LOL|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	men keep growing till they are 21. women stop at 18 i would say no and dont worry about it.|`|DRSjrp04aa	If they dont, get an enlargement.

Good luck!|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	Yes, those are classic symptoms of a UTI.  As well as these:  Symptoms of UTI or bladder infection are not easy to miss and include a strong urge to urinate that cannot be delayed which is followed by a sharp pain or burning sensation in the urethra when the urine is released. Most often very little urine is released and the urine that is released may be tinged with blood. The urge to urinate recurs quickly and soreness may occur in the lower abdomen, back, or sides.    This cycle may repeat itself frequently during the day or night--most people urinate about six times a day, when the need to urinate occurs more often a bladder infection should be suspected.    When bacteria enters the ureters and spread to the kidneys, symptoms such as back pain, chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting may occur, as well as the previous symptoms of lower urinary tract infection.    Proper diagnosis is vital since these symptoms can also be caused by other problems such as infections of the vagina or vulva. Only your physician can make the distinction and make a correct diagnosis.     Please get to a doc soon as it can back up into your kidneys.|`|jeztbF6naa	im 100% sure you have a bladder infection. thats what all my symptoms were when i had one.  once your off your period look to see if there is blood in your urine if so then you have a kidney stone.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	It sounds positive for a urinary tract or bladder infection.

Hope you feel better soon!|`|5cKoep6uaa	I had that same thing like a month ago.. It didn't really burn when I went pee, it just hurt like when the last bit of pee was coming out.

So I would maybe try that, and if it doesn't go away in a week, I would go to a doctor.

G35SjmTiaa	I don't understand someone who claims to be an RN calling someone a moron for asking a medical question and her answer was wrong! The guidelines state It is recommended that patients transitioning  from methadone to Buprenorphine slowly  taper to 30 mg./day of methadone, for at  least one week. Last dose must be no less  than 36 hours prior to induction, and may  be 96 hours or more.
