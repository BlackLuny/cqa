I now have Verizon but I did not do the prepaid plan for the reason you mentioned.<br>  <br>  I am doing a regular plan but without a contract on a month to month basis.  I am limited to 450 minutes but I rarely use the phone so for me this was not a problem.  You might call Verizon or check at a local store and ask about this. My bill is only $45-50 per month but I guess that can differ from where you are.

VMVW3E7Aaa	Why are you asking the same question twice?<br>  <br>  Here is what I answered you in the other one already:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>

UH6uMw75aa	The iPod Touch is an iPod device although has expanded the functions of use than the other range of iPods. <br>  iPod Touch is similar to iPhone except on the Touch it has no phone function and no camera use.<br>  On the iPod Touch there is a lot of uses such as going on the internet, however you would require a wireless internet connection like a wireless router and the connection has to be near the device. <br>  Also on the iPod Touch, you can access to games and the thing for this is that while playing on them you can turn it such as when you play on a racing car game to steer your wheel you can turn your iPod Touch like you would steer in the car.<br>  The main use of the iPod Touch is that you can listen to your music.<br>  <br>  If you like the sound of it buy it, but its your choice as iPod Touch is dependent on what you would want from it.|`|zqxP5exvaa	Hey, its an ipod. have u seen the comercials??????<br>  LOLl

iGy9j1uaaa	The red lights indicate hardware problems with your xbox.  3 red lights are covered by an extended warranty from Microsoft due to the common problem caused by a bad hardware design which basically makes the mainboard in the xbox to overheat and unsolder connections on some components inside. The trick your friend is referring to is basically wrapping the xbox in a towel and trying to overheat the console so much that the connections re-solder themselves, at best it would be a temporary fix. If your xbox is under 3 years old contact microsoft to get it repaired free of charge.|`|fwKMZqwlaa	NO! my xobx red ringed, and there is nothing you can do about it... you are going to have to call microsoft, and they charge you $100, to fix it :-/|`|RpCwfcRzaa	Don't try this. It's called the towel trick and it just causes more problems. Call up MS at 1-800-4-My-Xbox and you can send it in for a free fix or replacement as long as you've had it for less than 3 years.  They extended the warranty on any console that gets the red rings of death to 3 years now as long as it's the real red rings of death (3 red segments around the power button).|`|wIM3vNtwaa	NO!<br>  Just send it back for free
mCNLdKPjaa	i have one<br>  yes you can text right away on your familys plan and you get used to the keyboard pretty fast|`|z88IMXNFaa	First of all, if you buy an iPhone 3g on eBay, you're going to pay a lot more than the $200 AT&T price - more like $500+.  Of course, you or someone on your family plan have to be eligible for an upgrade in order to get the $200 price.  It appears that texting would be covered under your family plan.  AT&T requires iPhone buyers to get a data plan.  This allows you to access the internet over the 3g network.  It's $30/month.  You can also access the internet on wifi networks and hot spots.<br>  <br>  The iPhone keyboard has no real "buttons."  It's an on-screen keyboard.  It is VERY difficult to get use to and thumbs are not a good choice.  You should visit a retailer that sells the phone and experiment with it.  A lot of texters absolutely HATE the iPhone because of its keyboard.  In Japan, many iPhone owners use a stylus but since there's no place to store one, it hasn't caught on here.<br>  <br>  Another thing to note, there's a very good chance that a new iPhone will be released this summer.  Many people are holding off on the iPhone right now because the new version may offer some decent fixes to common problems.<br>  <br>  The phone is a lot of fun but it has issues.  One is the keyboard,  Another is the battery life.  The 3g network isn't everywhere.  A case is not optional and good ones are pricey.  Insurance is not available so if you drop the phone and break it, you are totally screwed (one of the reasons a good case is essential).<br>  <br>  I love the phone but I don't text.  You need to try it out before you spend any money on this phone.  While it has a huge coolness factor, it may not be practical for you.

pDcJGptPaa	Newbie Lens 101:<br>  <br>  The 55-200mm is the focal length of the lens. Think of it like this:<br>  50mm is what they call a normal lens. It is what the human eye sees, and is thus dubbed "normal". 200mm is a telephoto. Any lens that will go from one focal length to another is referred to as a "Zoom" lens.  Think of a pair of binoculars. If you zoom the focal length to 200mm, you are magnifying the view. The f4-5.6 refers to the f-stop or aperature of the lens. Within each lens is a series of diaphragms that control the amount of light that enters the lens and ulitmately hits the sensor (or film) which records the image. The lower the f number, the wider the aperature ( or hole ) , which lets more light in. The higher the number, the smaller the aperature which lets in less light. Here is another way to look at it: Take a drinking straw and look through the end of it. It is a small opening. That would be like an f22 aperature, and would allow less light to enter the lens to reach the sensor which records the image. Now, take a tube from an empty roll of paper towels and look through the end. This would be like an f4 aperature, and would allow more light to enter the lens. Get it? The main function of aperature has to do with "depth of field". The easiest way to explain depth of field is--how much blurryness occurs in the background of the subject of any given image. In Japanese, this is called "Bokeh". The faster (or lower number) the aperature, the less depth of field. Imagine you are on a football field and you are standing at the end zone on the 0 yard line. Your subject is on the ten yard line ahead of you. If you have your aperature at f4, the depth of field is very shallow. If you focus on your subject's face, then everything around/beyond it will be blurry (nice bokeh). If you have your aperature set at f22, then your depth of field expands. Most everything in the background  and foreground will be in focus, just like your subject--all the way down to the goal post on the other end of the field.  On a zoom lens like this one you posted, the f4-5.6 means two things. The f4 means that at 50mm, the wider end of the zoom range,  the maximum aperature (or f-stop) is 4, which is a relatively wide opening for light to enter (paper towel tube). You can still make the aperature smaller (to f22), but the widest it will get is f4.  The 5.6 is what you can expect as a maximum aperature (or opening) if you were zoomed out all the way to 200mm. Either way, you can still adjust the opening on both ends up to usually f22 (drinking straw sized opening, remember?) and some lenses can go even smaller. So, basic rule of thumb : the smaller the f number, the larger the aperature opening. The higher the focal length (say 200mm compared to 50mm), the closer you get to the subject, or "zoom" in on it. There are many variables with light, shutter speed, and aperature that is involved with photography, and certainly a few good books, videos or classes would give you a more comprehensive approach, but I just gave you a very basic starting point to understanding the factors involved with photography. BTW, the best way (and quickest) to learn is hands on with someone who has experience.|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	You need to start doing some reading!<br>  Attend a class, read some books, read/watch online tutorials.<br>  <br>  The major camera manufacturers (like Canon, Nikon, Olympus etc) all have very useful sections on their website for learning about photography.<br>  <br>  Understanding at least  the basic principles of photography will enable you to make an educated choice when buying a camera, and will make a HUGE difference to your images.|`|n71t0xoCaa	55 to 200 is the focal length this zoom lens can have a focal length from 55mm to 200 mm if you are using it on an APSc sensor camera multiply that time 1.5 as the focal lenght is for 35 mm/ full frame format so on those cameras it will have a focal length of around 80-300<br>  <br>  The f 4.5 to 5.6 isd the largest aperature the lens can have. At 55 mm it will open up to f4.5 at 200 mm it will only have a large aperature setting of 5.6<br>  <br>  The G means that it is a gelded lens there is no aperature ring on the lens body aperature is controlled in camera. <br>  <br>  ED is extra low dispersion glass to cut down on chromatic aberation and lens distortion<br>  <br>  This is a DX lens so it was designed for an APSc camera if it said FX it was designed for a full frame sensor / 35 mm camera

hJP9y6kjaa	A lower impedance and a high sensitivity (higher the better, ideally as close to 100 db as possible, although there are some that can do more) are the two statistics that tell you in general how loud the headphones will be - low impedance is good, high sensitivity is better (since sensitivity is a measure of how efficient the drivers are).<br>  <br>  The frequency range isn't a very valuable measurement, to me, since it's very easy for the manufacturer to manipulate these numbers to the point where I feel they're barely meaningful.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|Vgm7JBslaa	those are goooood (: i personally like the iPod earphoness (:

You can't tell when the failure could occur or what would happen when it does.  If you're not in the same room when something happens it could cause a fire or an number of other things.  At least have it check at a repair shop.

(:|`|o6BDapZjaa	If you're calling or texting a Canadian phone number, then there will be international charges; it's effectively a long distance call because you must connect to it through another country's network.  T-Mobile charges 9 cents per minute to call a Canadian phone, whether the phone is a land-line or a cell phone, assuming you have International Discounted Calling (which is free, I might add).  Texting to Canadian phones from a T-Mobile phone is 20 cents per message.<br>  <br>  If it's a U.S. phone (any carrier) and it's IN Canada for a while, then there shouldn't be any extra charges for you.  T-Mobile would access it through the phone's U.S. carrier; after that, getting the call to the recipient is that company's responsibilty, and so doesn't involve us doing anything different.  Any extra charges incurred would be by the call/text recipient.

lkqjJisaaa	No, this is a bad deal.  Here is why:<br>  The two main lenses are Tamron lenses, not Canon lenses.  And the 28-80 isn't very wide, so you can't take a wide shots without having to step back.<br>  <br>  The two auxillary lenses aren't real lenses, but screw-on filter lenses that are junk.  They are so bad that they are pretty much worthless.<br>  <br>  The memory card is a no-name memory card, which means it will be slow.<br>  <br>  And the dealer probably isn't an authorized Canon dealer, which can create warranty problems.<br>  <br>  U can get a Canon XSi with a Canon 18-55mm lens for $639 at amazon.com (which is authorized).  A Tamron 75-300mm lens is $115 at adorama.com.  Good memory cards from Sandisk sell for under $20.  The rest of the stuff is just odds and ends U could pick up on your own.  Avoid the auxillary screw-on "lenses"; get real lenses that mount on the camera.<br>  <br>  Don't get ripped off by trying to save a few dollars here or there.  If U buy a camera from an unauthorized dealer, it will cost U more if the camera doesn't have a warranty and U are not getting good lenses from them.  This is not a good deal.|`|pDcJGptPaa	I agree with Mr A -- Costco has the kit with the 18-55mm as well. It is $699 online and you get the 90 day return policy, which is awesome.
b13b8789df525b2cd030771dd86791dfaa	I'm a 22 year old college student. I bought an Ipod touch to use for school (and fun hehe) and trust me it's worth it. I use it more than my laptop. Besides how ridiculously functional the thing is, it has all these really fun Apps. Buy it. Seriously I came into some money and looked at the Xbox 360 (they seem to come with a countdown clock to breaking) and a guitar. I bought the touch and I am really happy with it. It's the best purchase I've made in a while. If you buy one make sure you buy the 2nd generation and if you plan on putting any music, videos on it get the 32 GB.  Also Amazon has them for cheaper then stores FYI.|`|FRPjpKKCaa	It's worth. I have a suggestion for you. A link below offer FREE iPod with 5 different items. Yes, they give it FREE.

PS2 is a dead market.|`|XqzH0l0Maa	not sure but i myself am thinking of unloading one and a gamecube with about 40 games between the two consoles and two wired controllers and about 5 wireless controllers with memory cards. i bought them myself from someone unloading for $140. i suggest you just offer it for what you think is reasonable. i know for sure you cant get back what you paid for it. starting with the system, they sell them in the gamestop stores for about $60 and each game my be worth like a fourth of what you paid for them. according to what i got, i would say that i paid for my ps2 and about 20 games with 4 controllers an memory card for $70. then the gamecube with 20 games 2controllers and a memory card was $70. i bought it from someone on craigslist. good luck.|`|SQQca8G5aa	Ebay, Right?<br>  I'd say, because it sounds used, at least 300, maybe more.

6SJ8QHKcaa	The iPhone hasn't been out that long, so I don't know if we've had time to discover any disadvantages.  However, from what I can see, it's a very cool phone & we all want one!|`|o6BDapZjaa	I work with iPhones on a pretty regular basis.  They're comparatively fragile phones, in my experience.  They have a LOT of restrictions on them from AT&T; for instance, if you upgrade iTunes software, it will generally relock an unlocked iPhone.  They also can't serve internet to a computer (Bluetooth is only usable for a headset, not phone-to-phone or phone-to-computer transfers).  <br>  <br>  For my money, there are many better phones on the market.  I have a BlackBerry, and it's an exceptional phone.|`|z88IMXNFaa	I love the phone.  I love that it's an all in one and I don't have to drag a bunch of devices around.  The apps are a lot of fun even if all you do is download free ones.  It's pretty easy to use even if you haven't really read the user guide.<br>  <br>  However, there are issues.  Battery life could be a lot better.  The keyboard can be difficult to get use to.  The camera is only adequate and there's no video.   A case is not optional and good ones are pricey.  The phone scratches easily and, more importantly, no insurance is available.  If you drop the phone and break it, you are totally and completely screwed.  Monthly plans are pretty expensive.  They start at $70/month and go up to $150/month.<br>  <br>  Finally, as a new iPhone will probably be released this summer, it's probably a good idea to hold off until you see what's been changed and added.|`|4cMuedpWaa	The only disadvantage that can be seen is that the Bluetooth is locked and can only be used to pair with a headset.<br>  <br>  You can't use it to transfer files/music/pictures or else.<br>  <br>  But, as time go, there are way to go around this "little" problem.<br>  <br>  Another feature that many complain about is the lack of copy/paste option which I personally don't care about.<br>  <br>  I had the iPhone since it came out and the iPhone 3G since it came out.

Y4s4Om38aa	Target if you have any near you.   Amazon if you can shop online.   Most retailers get very few in at a time and they go quick.  I know with target they put them out the day the ads come out.  Even if they came in prior, they have to have them on the day the ad is out saying they have it, even if it is only a few, so they will keep them in the back and will not sell them til that day.  Try early morning at any retailer the day ads come out that would list them(this is probably the case with walmart, toysRus, radio shack, bestbuy, but i could be wrong).  I know Game stop does not go by that rule...they get things in whenever, dont even know when they will, and they go out as soon as they have them...but they also do not have weekly ads like other stores do.|`|RShi5KUmaa	the trick is to go to gamestop on a shipping day, which is usually tuesday or wednesday and go when they open.

AA11256390	Both are the same, it's basically the quality of the camera not the mega pixels that's affecting things here. Sony, I have found, normally have very good camera's even down to their 2MP ones they used to do. It's probably just that the Samsung camera isn't a good one and doesn't have a good lens which can be a big factor|`|ncAiWIvWaa	They are the same thing.<br>  <br>  The differing quality of pics could be anything from the camera settings (maybe set up to take pics in the dark when its being used in the day).<br>  <br>  Not forgetting each brands software makes a difference too, 5.0 mega pixel phones will differ depending on model and brand.<br>  <br>  Plenty of sights for phone reviews that detail the cameras and show sample pics and describe which phone cameras are better than others.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you picked a better phone for taking pics and friends has other better features than yours if it was expensive. <br>  <br>  Or ermm she paid over the odds for it.|`|6k71ig11aa	Don't pay to much attention to the number of pixels per inch, My camera has only 3.1 ppi. Remember it's the finger on the shutter, and finally the printer which counts.|`|xj9NY7xDaa	it  is the dots in in one inch the more dots the better the photo looks so if you 12 mega pixels  that's 1200 dots a inch and photos are fantastic|`|elY5vkVyaa	Exactly the same, both cameras are 5 megapixel. When you buy cameras don't pay too much attention to the megapixels; more Megapixels means higher resolution but it doesn't mean a clearer picture!

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  You may never need expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, but the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)  <br>   <br>  There is no one place to get great buys, but click the second link in the information above then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.<br>   <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.

Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.

Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.<br>  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion<br>  go to this link for help <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a>

Then, using the BlackBerry desktop manager you can sync from Outlook back to your 8330.|`|Stv5TGwBaa	You need to export your contacts from the Palm Centro.  I'm not familiar with that process, but presumably you have some software that will do that.  Export the contacts into a delimited text file format (like comma or tab).  This should be a common export option.  Once you have the contacts exported to a file, you can import them with the BB Desktop Manager software using the synchronize function.

It's cheap on contract and it's great. The touch screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is about as spaced as it gets for verizon. It also has a nice camera.<br>  <br>  T-Mobile - I have a T-Mobile Sidekick and I'm absolutely in love with it. It's a great phone with a spacious keyboard, and it does everything, but on T-Mobile, beware because you need to add $20 for unlimited internet, email, im, texting, and picture messaging. so if you subtract what you're already paying for texting from that, it's not actually too bad.<br>  <br>  Sprint- I don't know much about sprint phones, but my friend has a rumor, and I've used it and it's nice. It works seamlessly, and it's great for texting.<br>  <br>  Blackberrys are good whether you use interenet or not. Having a full keyboard is great for texting. Also they usually have large menu's with tons of cool stuff you can do, ex; the blackberry pearl.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|sPR3qpTMaa	Depends on what kind of phones you like, but if i were you.<br>  I'd get:<br>  <br>  Iphone, its from Mac, how can you go wrong.

6edczUEBaa	If it is saying file not supported that means it is not reading your SD card. It is not going to work unless you transfer files from one SD to card to a different brand but you should be able to use a USB cord connected from your camera to your photo frame or a USB cord from your computer to your photo frame that is how I download all my pics to my frame. Hope this helps.|`|IvkZNs0caa	You do not say what format the pictures are saved as nor do you mention what formats the photo frame will support.  You also don't mention the kind of camera being used.<br>  <br>  Are you sure that the type of SD card and that the photo format are supported by the frame.<br>  <br>  Most photo frames support .jpg format and sometimes other formats as well.  If the pictures or card are not in a supported format you need to convert them to one that matches one supported by the frame.  The best way to do that is to buy a card that matches the specifications of the frame and copy/convert the pictures to .jpg (may also specified as .jpeg) format with your computer and save them to the new card.  Then insert that card in the frame.<br>  <br>  P.S. If it is saying "not supported file" it IS either recognizing the files on the card but saying they are the wrong type OR recognizes that a card is inserted but saying it cannot support the format of the card.

If you don't know what folder it is, go to preferences (or settings), and click the Downloads tab at the left. After you know what folder it downloads in, you can drag that song into iTunes, and then sync your iPod. But I suggest downloading your songs from youtube, using a program called Videoget. If you need more help using Videoget, just email me, and I'd be glad to help you.|`|ylMZ4mSYaa	You can try this iPod Video Converter Suite to rip DVD movie and convert videos in any format to iPod.

VXmS3K07aa	Yes you can. My kids both have Virgin Mobile phones. They never use them for calling. We just get unlimited text messaging every month.
sR3gcvubaa	Sometimes cameras do have a limit of the size of memory card they can take. Maybe yours can't handle a card that large.  Another thing to check is to see if the card is an SDHC . Some of the newer ones are and maybe that type of card won't work with yours.

This phone is available in white and black. It has a calendar (as normal) , It has a note feature, It has 3 games (i they vary) , 2mp video/camera, music player, 128mb card, airplane profile, and more much more!<br>  <br>  3. I would recommend a Sony Erricson as I had it before the one i have now, and it is really good. Make sure if you are getting a Sony Erricson, make sure it has a good screen with lots of picels.<br>  <br>  4. Do not pay over ￡150, because if you loose it, or brake it, theres no getting it back.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Plus Nokia phones usually don't work after water.<br>  Tip: Make sure you take your phone out of your poket, before you put it in the wash.|`|GyPNO47gaa	Orange is brilliant - you get Orange Wednesdays at cinemas and there are always loads of free texts and call time they give away.

CQA4HAdmaa	It appears either the USB wire you use to change your shuffle is damaged, your battery has died or something bigger is involved with the shuffle..I would take it to an Apple genius at the Apple store and see if the battery is the problem.  I agree it appears you battery died.  If that's the case, it's  easy to replace for about $10.00-$17.00.  If nobody gives you an answer, I would replace the battery. The new batteries will last a lot longer. Unless you have been rough on your shuffle, it's your battery-your ipod should last you a long time. In all cases, it's cheaper to replace a battery yourself, than buying  new one.|`|pl6eDKQbaa	Either just the light has blown (possible) or else the battery has just completely died (likely), OR just the wiring has come loose inside it (likely). My advice is to just keep using it and see if it is the battery, if it is then just toss it and buy a new one they really aren't worth fixing. If its wiring do the same thing. BTW are you using iTunes to read your shuffle because thats the only program that can and will, if you are and its still not then the wiring is probably just completely busted and its not worth fixing.|`|DcYD9vWRaa	try a different computer|`|A1lVrI8Yaa	Take it to the apple store and have them look at it.

BmtJd3foaa	First let me start off with the good things<br>  G0od Things: a cutting-edge design with a brilliant touch screen and a spacious keyboard. It offers a generous features set that includes EV-DO support, V Cast Mobile TV Bluetooth, a top-notch Web browser, and an integrated GPS application. And if that's not enough, its call quality was excellent.<br>  <br>  BAD THINGS: The LG Voyager VX10000's camera lacks such extra options as a flash and Wi-Fi. The touch screen can be clunky at times, and the streaming video quality and EV-DO connection speed were uneven.|`|Vgm7JBslaa	it is a really good phonee (: i like how you can choose to use the touch part or the regular keyboradd :D<br>  <br>  the bad things are:<br>  -big phone<br>  -touch may be defective at times (not offten, dont worry)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and it does have a really goood camerraa, i have the phonee !(: i lovee it.

HVQFVtelaa	You are asking the wrong question, but it's not your fault. Almost no one knows that stereos have almost nothing to do with what you call "sound quality". I was the top stereo salesman for years at the best store in Louisiana, but people did not come to me for stereos, they came to me for speakers.<br>  <br>  Our sound rooms had dozens of stereos and speakers set up with switching systems. I would set the tone controls of every stereo in the middle, switch off the "loudness" button, and set the volume level of every stereo to the same volume in one set of speakers.<br>  <br>  I would switch 20 different stereos into one set of speakers, and there was no change, none, not from a $200 to $1000 range on the stereos. But, on any stereo, when I switched the speakers, the sound quality jumped up and down in volume and sound quality, every single time.<br>  <br>  I had many people that came in to spend $1500 on equipment, and $500 in speakers. They ended up spending $500 in equipment, and $1500 in speakers, almost every time. If they spent $3000, $1500 was for speakers for sure.<br>  <br>  Speakers are the vocal cords of a stereo, plain and simple. No stereo sounds better than it's speakers.<br>  <br>  Oh, and amplifier power has no bearing. Speakers are electric motors, and vary in performance like Volkswagons and Corvettes. I had an antique set of Electro Voice Patrician Corner Horns with 30 inch woofers, and could freak people by driving them with a $5 transistor radio from a garage sale powered by a 9 volt battery.<br>  <br>  This is all very, very true.|`|p1dcw35Qaa	For $50 more I'd go with the Denon AVR-589. It's very similar to the 295 but has 75w/channel and 5.1 sound so you can hook it up to your tv if you like (in the future). The 50W might not be as loud as you would like. Your Sony has 100w but Denon's 75 will certainly power your speakers as well (if not better).

qWicVoU9aa	They can do upgrades as well.  The thing with authorized dealers is they actually have to purchase their inventory so they may not be as willing to swap phones out if there is a problem with them.  Company owned AT&T stores get their inventory provided free and they have more latitude when Tech Support needs to have them get a free SIM card or swap out an accessory that is not working and things like that.  The authorized dealers will not do those things because it costs them money out of their pockets|`|ULw1777caa	The ones that aren't cannot help you with account issues and only sell the products.
gOPLkAUVaa	LCD is cheaper but the quality is lower.<br>  Plasma is better if you can afford it.<br>  <br>  Check my source for a good guide.|`|Yl9wYjtGaa	get an 09 lcd. there slowly taking over the market. in the 32" size unless you want top top of the line your gonna want 720p with a high color contrast. yes yes i no not 1080p haha the thing is when your dealing with a screen that small you dont see a huge difference between the 720 and 1080. 37" is where you start to flirt with 1080p 40 inch and up you have to have it ( larger screen pixels are more spaced out hence u need more ie, 1080p) <br>  you have to go sony or samsung im not sure what the 09 models will bring but in 08 samsung kicked ***. both are great tv;s tho. as far as plasma goes you dont see alot below 42 inches i would recommend if you do go with plasma to bump up in size simply cuz its cheaper. make sure its full 1080p  panasonic is good brand for plasmas. new 09 lg looks nice too. but plasmas like others have said do run the risk of picture burn ins you can still watch movies and play games just dont hit pause and leave for a day or fall asleep. they also are made with thicker glass screens, more durable, but bad with glare. on a good note tho they have a wider range of colors and have better for motion.<br>  all and all lcd has a sharper image plasma handles motion better. lcd is better with glare plasma has more colors. lcd lasts longer plasmas crap out and use more energy. but there cheaper. either one your going ot be happy picture wise but your call.|`|A1lVrI8Yaa	LCD plasma tvs you can only use for watching tv because if you play games on it or some movies it could burn a image into the tv.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	LCD TV is better way to go and I recommend Samsung,great picture.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D979929011%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fp%255F4%255F0%26keywords%3Dlcd%2520tv%252032%26bbn%3D979929011%26qid%3D1236436362%26rnid%3D15784691%26rh%3Dn%253A1065836%252Cn%253A172659%252Cn%253A979929011%252Ck%253Alcd%2520tv%252032%252Cp%255F4%253ASamsung&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|sO2CKU1uaa	Plasma screens will burn in if you play video games or anything static on the screen.

As far as which is better you have to determine what it's for.  LCD's are great for tv and decent for games and movies.  They make outstanding bedroom tv's because of this.  For the living room and for great movie and game quality you want a plasma.  They can take up a lot of power and get a lot of glare in a bright room though.|`|PrFwT0P0aa	lcd i want one myself been shopping around samsung and sony  are about the best they make there own screens in house|`|lO6zgftaaa	personiallly i like plamso i have a 50" plamsa in my apartment!

But if you're only a casual player, I guess the flaws won't stand out too much.  If you're looking for a good multiplayer game, I'd go with Little Big Planet.  I agree with the guy up there.  COD4 is definitely better than WaW.|`|lKjZlkz6aa	dont get nba 2k9 and cod5<br>  <br>  get Killzone 2 (I read the question i know what you said), and littlebigplanet, its fun:D|`|7b9jWJNZaa	Try Ghost Recon.|`|LbDoNsQqaa	well if you really wanna know id go for that little big planet one. i was gonna buy it then the console melted on me ive played it though its hard to get used to but its great fun|`|qog4MvbOaa	The one game I couldn't live without on PS3 is The Orange Box.

CQA4HAdmaa	Do not turn your iPod on.  Turn your iPod face down (Screen down) into a bowl of rice for two days, then have it in direct sunlight for 3 days.  Try to turn it after then<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, there are also after marker repair companies that should be able to fix it.|`|hcORMcOwaa	Just try to let it dry on its own. When my cell phone got wet it was just a waiting game. I did put my blow dryer on low heat and a low setting to blow some of the water out. Good luck!

Theres two options. Leave it out in the sun for a while and try and get all the water out, possibly use a hair dryer (ON LOW HEAT!!) and then try it. Maybe its just that some water is jamming it. Or more likely it needs new wiring inside (AKA dead) and you will need to either hope it can be replaced under warranty (unlikely) reparied under warranty (slightly more likely) repaired outside of warranty (fairly cheap) or just buy a new one (expensive). That's basically your only options.|`|XFHleRhWaa	Get all the water you can out, set it in a sunny window, or on top of a TV or some other heat generating like a stereo, satellite receiver, and forget it for 2-3 weeks. They will dry out and work, my sister washed hers and it took awhile to dry but it did and works now!|`|xCOUaK3raa	That happened to my friend. He called the Apple company and they told him to dump it in a bowl of dry rice and leave it over night because the rice absorbs a lot of the water.

V4OpQF0caa	Sidekick are famous for burning out the little box inside that charges the phone. If you had a charging and it didn't charge your best bet is to buy the dock station for sidekick. This way u can charge up the battery alone or with it inside the phone...<br>  <br>  I repeat there is nothing wrong with the power cord, it's the charging box insidee the sidekick that burns out quickly.

(you can hear this broadcast on any shortwave radio at 5,000  10,000  or 15,000 mhz)<br>  It is more likely set by a signal broadcast by your local PBS television station. Again just keep it hooked to an antenna.<br>  I'm not an engineer, but this doesn't need to be broadcast very often to keep accurate time. Maybe 2 or 3 times a day would be adequate.<br>  I'm wondering if this will be affected if all of your PBS stations have gone digital. How about it techies?  Will the clock setting still function?|`|2sMA3HQCaa	Some VCRs (like yours) read a digital time-code transmission for the purpose that is present on PBS broadcasts. (It is on a non-visual portion of the video signal known as the "vertical blanking interval".) For it to work properly, your VCR must have the dayling saving option on, and know about the newer March 8 switchover.

AbRfd29Haa	Most major hour-long drama shows are still shot on 35mm film, not digital video<br>  <br>  According to the Avid website:<br>       [Heroes]  is shot on 3-perf 35mm film with Panavision G2 cameras and on 4-perf 35mm film with the Panavision Millennium XL. The film is telecined simultaneously to D5 and DVCAM 30i formats and finished at 24 fps on D5 tape.<br>  <br>  Of course, given that, you can pretty much figure it's editing on Avid software. <br>  <br>  "Lost" is certainly shot on 35mm, too, though I couldn't quickly locate the gear used. <br>  <br>  There are a number of shows shot on video, but they tend to be low-cost productions or sitcoms. And most use somewhat higher-end digital formats. Due to the great size of HDV, it is used for some broadcast work, usually where size is an issue:  shows like "Deadliest Catch" and "Mythbusters". They did some scenes on "JAG" in HDV, based on camcorder size constrains. <br>  <br>  The BBC currently considers HDV a "non-broadcast domestic HD format," but accepts HDV footage for up to 25% of HD programming content with advance approval. <br>  <br>  The preferred delivery formats for Discovery HD Theater are HD-D5 and HDCAM. HDV source content is accepted if it is limited to 15% of a whole program and is shot with a 1080-line camera.

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	Only a high end receiver has Zone 2 output 5.1 and it is very expensive. Most of receivers have Zone 2 only output 2 channel ( stereo ).|`|UinOWcMUaa	If you have zone 2 your can still run a 7.1 through zone 2.. but it will drop maybe just a little depending on how long of a run the speakers are... :)|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Yes, you can either have 7.1 OR you can have 5.1 and 2-channel Zone 2.<br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't be surprised if there were a high-end receiver that could do both.  I've heard of 10.2 setups, so there's probably something out there for you, but it's out of my price point so I haven't done the research on it.  There's usually something for eveyone, it's just a matter of whether or not you want to pay for it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: After a quick bit of research it appears you can to both if you buy an extra amp, but that's out of my league of expertise, so I'll leave that to the true tech geeks out there.|`|raFYuWouaa	yes. for most. the 10.2 format is used only for movie theater exclusively .  I would select theone78 as the best answer if I were you charlie.
ZFuiy3Tsaa	When you connect your Zune and open the Zune program does the program recognize your Zune? If it doesn't then that is where your problem is. <br>  <br>  Doe you have your program set to automatically sync or manually sync? Do you have it set to let you choose everything that gets synced?<br>  <br>  If the program does recognize your Zune then I would start by trying to sync individual songs-not the playlist. See if your Zune will add one or two songs. If it does then I would erase all the music or the playlists that won't sync and resync your collection to your Zune.<br>  <br>  Feel free to message me if you have more questions or if what I suggested doesn't work. I'll help if I can.

F80jKUvYaa	They are only able to read the texts if they pay an extra fee a month to be able to read them. If your parents have a MyVerizon account  you can go online and guess the password and get the account and see. But to be honest I'm not 100 percent sure they can track that. They can just block you from sendind and recieving texts from a person they don't want you talking to. They can't actually read the texts.|`|LR4zUwcwaa	depends...if they're stalker parents, they can call verizon and have all text messages mailed to them. be careful homie.

0EaA6IACaa	noo it's not a touch screen.<br>  i give it a 2/10 it's a horrible phone....it's flimsy, my paint is chipping off, the camera is horrible, and it's very slow sometimes. also you have to use the text ringtones provided on the phone, you can't buy your own and set it for when you get a text. you might not care about that but i don't like that.<br>  <br>  the only good thing about it is the "qwerty" keyboard and it holds alottttt of text messages.|`|Dpr8CUBSaa	It's not a touchscreen. <br>  I would give this phone a 5/10.<br>  It's a Windows Mobile device which is very slow but it has some advantages.

I charge mine every night and I use it all day long texting & calling people and it usually never gets below 40%

VMVW3E7Aaa	I assume you're probably talking about a P&S, rather than a DSLR.<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Nikon D-90...|`|aanOTbovaa	It depends on how much they are willing to spend but I would always go with Cannon because they are great quality cameras. If they want to spend a lot and get you a top of the line camera I would go with the EOS line but if they want to spend a more reasonable price but still get you something you will take great photos with, I would recommend anything in the powershot family. Just check out their website and see if there are any you like the looks of!|`|18I6loFTaa	I just brought a Nikon d90 !  I must say that it is a wonderful camera!

In my travels, I buy a fairly inexpensive quad band phone. (Vodaphone has some for about 40 to 50 euros) and when I arrive at the country I am going, I buy a SIM card for local phones.  For people to call me from home I use www.maxroam.com. They sell you a SIM card with some credit and it is much cheaper than using your orange phone.  maxroam allows you to have a UK phone and a local phone as well.  Try them.|`|WyWtnigoaa	Best way to avoid International roaming is by having a local Indian SIM card from RebelFone, meant for travelers.

The speeds are so fast on 3g phones, its like broadband on cellphone,  VEry satisfied with the quality.    I am living in nyc with a 3g phone and service  its really affective here, can maybe depend on your location again,   hope this gives you an idea|`|o6BDapZjaa	It really doesn't matter much.  I have a BlackBerry 8900, and I don't need or use the 3G network.  It takes a few seconds more to download images and graphics, but that's about the only difference you'll notice; presuming you have a little grown-up level patience, you should be fine :-)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you watch a lot of videos, or download a LOT of music, then you may want to go with the 3G phone; it's all a question of where your priorities lie.

Neither are on the top >_<<br>  <br>  The View isn't all bad though, it has a larger screen than the Fuze, still has the Micro SD card compatability and codec support. However, it might end up being replaced soon.<br>  <br>  So either go for an ultraportable music only player (Clip) or a jack of all trades expandable player (Fuze)<br>  <br>  Either way, you won't be dissappointed :)|`|aq0wOb6Waa	.

o6BDapZjaa	They want money; the contract is where they make their money - phones cost comparatively little, which is why they give them away like candy.  If you're locked into a contract, they KNOW they will be getting money (unless of course you're willing to risk your credit rating), so they practically give the phone away.  <br>  <br>  It's one reason I switched from a CDMA carrier to a GSM carrier (one that uses sim card technology).  The sim card doesn't care what phone it's in, as long as the phone is unlocked, so you can change handsets any time you want.|`|4cMuedpWaa	He should be able to have activated on a month-to-month option but NOT on a pay-as-you-go/prepaid.<br>  <br>  Unless Sprint is simply trying to tie him up to a data contract (which is more expensive).<br>  <br>  In any case, he should try different stores but I doubt the answer will be different.

o6BDapZjaa	To put an announcement on your voice mail (the outgoing message), you'll need to call your own voice mail and walk through the prompts.  The voice mail message is not kept on your phone; it "lives" on your carrier's cellular network, so you have to access the network to set it up.<br>  <br>  You can generally access your voice mail by pressing and holding the "1" key on your phone, if you're in the U.S.  If that doesn't work, try dialing your own phone number.

EMC7JwVBaa	Some electronic devices fare poorly in wet environments. If you're lucky, after the stereo dries out (steam from the shower gets everywhere), it might come back to life. If not, your life is now enriched with the knowledge that taking your next stereo into the shower will be fatal to it- then you'll avoid taking it to a moist place.  Water and electicity allow the electricity to flow where it doesn't belong, is why your problem happened.<br>  <br>  There are radios specifically designed to play in the shower.  One of those might make you happy.|`|raFYuWouaa	Wait a  minute ... You brought an electronic devise into the shower with you ???? And you are still alive... Wow you have to be the luckiest person alive. I strongly suggest that you go right out and play the lottery right now. But if you were actually smart enough not to do that it's just moisture that accumulated on the circuit board and shorted out the radio section of the devise. sometimes if you just let it sit turned off and unplugged for a week it will dry out and start working again but it may not.<br>  If you did bring it directly into the shower with you please do not ever do that again it will kill you by electrocution. I had to say that because your question was kind of vague.(un clear) my answer was not intended to be demeaning or offensive just informative.Further More the reason your voice may sound better in the shower is because of the Acoustics the walls have tile on them making them a hard surface and there is no absorbency of the sound waves which causes what is called reverberation or for short re verb which is very widely used in the recording studios and live concerts which is reproduced  electronically <br>  via an effects unit. In the old days it was a spring that the voice or any other source was electronically fed into that caused it to make a reverberation effect onto a recording or an instrument like a guitar or what ever else you'd like to be reverberated .  any how I could go on for hours on this subject but I will spare you the thoughts of suicide lol...<br>  I hope this answered your question. Wait and see if the radio comes back to life if not get another one. No biggie

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>

I51RUYZraa	Original Xbox sports a Pentium 3, in theory you could install Windows XP on this as it runs X86 based code but not sure how well it would work, or rather how you are going to get the console to boot the installation disk.  Xbox reads a custom boot profile from DVDs/CDs so a regular install disk will not work.  When you consider the cost of even modding the console to get as far as changing the firmware your overlapping the cost of buying a nice cheap off lease used computer that would be a great deal faster.

It's truly a business phone, but you can have fun with it, too.  Mine is the 8900, and it has GPS, wi-fi, and a music/media player, as well as a full-featured browser.  They are also capable of serving the internet to a laptop or desktop computer, with the proper set-up (about a 10-minute process once the Blackberry Desktop Manager has been properly installed).  <br>  <br>  I don't care for iPhones; I work with them, and I find them to be comparatively fragile; I have also been told that the camera is not great.  They're more toy than phone, and that's fine if that's what you want, but I prefer BlackBerry by far. <br>  <br>  I don't have a lot of experience with the N85, although some people I talk to have told me that the body and keypad are rather cheaply constructed.|`|f79cohStaa	IPHONE<br>  <br>  ~§BEST ANSWER§~|`|4cMuedpWaa	If you don't care for the camera, iPhone is the best to go with.<br>  <br>  If you need a quality build, great keyboard, awesome screen, almost perfect handling of emails/internet/contacts, your choice is a Blackberry.<br>  <br>  Bold or 8900 would be my choice as I have them both and they both are awesome.<br>  <br>  Let's me say it this way: for real work, Blackberry, for work and show the iPhone.

VOSyb1fcaa	There are three ways to get Wi-Fi on your Wii. You can do it through a router (recommended), you can get a Wi-Fi USB<br>  (it's been discontinued, but can still be found) and put it in your computer's router, or you can use a LAN adapter. <br>  <br>  Look here for more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/onlineRequirements.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  Next, watch this video or simply follow my instructions below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://us.wii.com/connect/" rel="nofollow">http://us.wii.com/connect/</a><br>  <br>  1.

Choose the from the connections your Wii has found (Look for your connection. You might have to provide some sort of password)<br>  <br>  If all goes well, you'll have to click OK a couple more times, wait for it to test the connection, then the Wii will reset itself and then you'll have internet!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1xr6T6h0aa	You need to either plug it into a router or directly to the cable modem.  Also, you need to purchase Wii Internet in order to browse.|`|1ezyHYh4aa	Since the Wii, does NOT have an ethernet port, only wireless, you'd need to purchase a USB ethernet adapter. Nintendo puts out a USB ethernet adapter that is compatible with the Wii. Once you have that device, you can connect the Wii to your laptop and enable Internet Sharing.<br>  <br>  For Internet Sharing to work, you need to set IP addresses on both your laptop's and Wii's network settings.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.|`|ZPVOzl8naa	i don't know use this thing u get from Nintendo it plugs into your laptop and its connects your wii to the internet its a little blue thing look in the wii manual

qWicVoU9aa	The service provider cannot help you when the passcode has been changed from the default.  It is not called a security code for no reason.  You have 3 choices:  <br>  1.  Replace the device<br>  2.  Send the device back to the manufacturer or take it to a shop to have the software flashed and reloaded<br>  3.  Start at 0000 and keep adding 1 to it (0000; 0001; 0002; etc) until you hit the right number<br>  <br>  Or you can take it to a repair shop and pay to have it done (which might be easier)|`|K5L63wbeaa	The network provider (Tmobile) will have the code.<br>  <br>  is it pre-pay or bill pay?<br>  <br>  if its pre-pay then a certain amount will have had to have been spent on that account before they give you the code. if its bill pay then they will give you the code whenever you want.<br>  <br>  if you find they they will not give you the code then bring it to any phone fixing place and they can unlock it for you for a small fee, about ￡10.<br>  <br>  **********EDIT*********<br>  <br>  WARNING ABOUT UNLOCKING CODES<br>  You might be able to find it on-line but unlocking codes are something you shouldn't mess with, if you enter the code into your phone incorrectly then you will 'over-lock' the phone and its a b!tch to get it fixed then.

RpCwfcRzaa	It depends on what exactly is wrong with your 360, if it's fixable or do they have to replace it, how backed up they are with other repairs, and how far you live from the repair center in Texas. Mine took 3 weeks to get back to me and they replaced it with a new one anyway.

qWicVoU9aa	Call you cell phone number and when the recording starts playing for the voicemail press the * key and it will interrupt it and take you in to the messages.  It may not work if you do not have any minutes though.  I don't know how Sprint works but the company I work for it does use minutes if the voicemail is longer than 30 seconds long.

xTioPxaVaa	My personal favorite is Kyser.  They make different models for acoustic and electric, as well as 6 and 12 string.  <br>  <br>  I like 'em because you can put them on and take them off with one hand.  I've got two that have held up for years.  They're about $20 each.<br>  <br>  Dunlop is now making a trigger style capo (like the Kyser), that's a little less money. I haven't used one, but I see acoustic players around town that are using them.<br>  <br>  All of these are available on line at www.musiciansfriend.com.  Just go there and search "capo"...you'll get about 3 pages of results.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken
vgdAVhj4aa	Well, it might just be LimeWire. I know a friend who does the same thing you do, and it works for her, but maybe its your computer's connection with LimeWire.

j5Apt8hWaa	It doesn't really matter, any good DSLR will do.  What is important are how much experience you have as a photographer, specifically as a wedding photographer.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider working as an assistant to a wedding photographer to learn the business, hone your photo skills and gather the equipment you will need to be a successful wedding photographer<br>  <br>  At the last weddings I attended, the photographers were using Fujifilm S5 pro, Nikon D300 and Canon 5D camera bodies ... all were using some kind of dedicated external flash and a 24-70 mm f/2.8 and 70-200 mm f/2.8 lens (both Nikon and Canon make such lenses)<br>  <br>  Considering the cost of the lenses alone, the body is really a secondary consideration.  $1700 to $2200 for the 24-70 mm f/2.8 and $1100 to $2000 for the 70-200 mm lenses|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Canon 5D is far better than Rebel XTi.It is a full frame DSLR.Here are some reviews of  5D f or wedding and hope you make a decision"My first wedding all I could say all day was wow. I was getting available light photographs I never would have dreamed of before. The new screen also made it incredibly easy to determine if something was in focus or not. When I would switch between my 40D and 5D2 I found out just how spoiled that screen had made me, since the 40D screen looked terrible to me now when previously I thought that had a great screen. I sure was wrong! 920,000 pixels is definitely the way to go on this LCD. I primarily shot with center point (one shot) for my focus and it nailed focus every time. I did a mix up of manual, aperture priority and some program (Program mostly for the formals) "|`|nvWaCl4Aaa	i like canon xs and sti|`|pDcJGptPaa	I have the 5D and the 50D. I use the 5D for short and the 50D for long. By short I mean wide angle --say 17mm -- to just above normal range -- say 70mm. By long I mean telephoto or zoom range from about 70mm to 200mm. With the 5D being a full sized sensor, it will read a 24mm lens as just that, 24mm. On the 50D, being a cropped sensor, you would multiply the 24mm by a factor of 1.6, thus it would be a 38mm on the 50D. The 5D can be had for about $1,300 slightly used and you can get the 50D for about the same new. Of course, you would have to buy the lenses additionally, which is where the low light scenario would come into play. You would want a fast lens for low light (like an f2.8 or lower). The 5D has a slight advantage over the 50D for low light, since it's sensor is full size and more sensitive to light, however the 50D is darned close with its noise reduction settings and the DIGIC 4 processor. So, it's really about the lens. You might look into the 40D for around $800 and fork over the cash on the quality glass (lens) -- which is not cheap either. The xTi at 10 mega pixels is a darned good camera , too. You may want to keep that and just buy a nice piece of Canon L glass. The rebel body is smaller than the 40D,50D, & 5D though, and the L lens might feel a bit unbalanced with the smaller body.

96c1fdd2ec46193779a7d841d0176878aa	Depends on the buzz. First things first, with the amp turned off, turn down the volume knobs and master knobs on the amplifier and the guitar. Then plug in the cable to the amplifier and into the guitar. NOW, turn on the amp. Slowly begin to turn up the volume on the guitar and amp (alternating based on desired sound)(if you want a more rough sound, turn the guitar's volume all the way up). If the amp buzzes no matter what volume, then you may need a different cable. First, try wiggling the cable at each end, while attached to the amp and guitar to see if the sound goes away. If it does, try a different cable. If it doesn't, there is an electronic short causing feedback. Now you need to try plugging the guitar into a different amp, and so on, troubleshooting until you find the source of the feedback.

Reboot could solve the problem, but there could be lots of other things wrong e.g., the SD could be corrupted or the contacts dirty.<br>   <br>  If you are still having trouble, the following information describes a better way to move/copy photos to and from a computer or memory card.<br>   <br>  Just received some pictures in an e-mail which I moved to the computer.  Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.  If megapixels of imported pictures is too high or low you may not be able to view on the camera, but pictures will show and print on computers.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.

Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore.

7Bx5DYv0aa	The following are the features you should look into a camera when you take to China:<br>  <br>  SHOCKPROOF, WATERPROOF, and DUSTPROOF.  Weight, Size, Optical Zoom, price (if in case you lose it there or it breaks), battery, memory card feature (SD card preferred as it is much cheaper and easily available in case you have to buy one from China).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about the digital zoom.  I personally don't even use it.  I feel it compromises the quality of the picture.  The Optical Zoom is important.  This is the mechanical zoom of your camera.  Most cameras have 3x to 5x optical zoom.<br>  <br>  I recently bought this one to take it to a trip to Texas.  I just love it.  10x optical zoom, 10 megapixel, SD card.

Here is a link to what a firewire cord looks like. <a href="http://www.dcables.net/Firewire-Cables.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcables.net/Firewire-Cables.a...</a><br>  <br>  If you have a mini dv (cassette) camcorder….<br>  Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.<br>  The fine print in your manual makes reference to firewire (ieee 1394) connection.

If you go outside where it is bright, how do your pictures turn out? <br>  <br>  The blur can be caused by two things, focus and movement of the camera or subject. If your shooting in dim lighting conditions, your camera will use a slow shutter speed which will give you a blurry image unless you have the camera on a tripod or benched on a table.<br>  <br>  The graininess is probably due to your camera choosing a sensitivity (ISO) that is high to compensate for the dim lighting conditions. High ISO settings (your camera chooses this automatically depending on lighting conditions) will give you grainy images.<br>  <br>  Thus, the solution may be more light.|`|Xl5KuMBcaa	1. The first issue sounds like you are not letting the camera autofocus.  Press the shutter button down half-way, let it focus, and then take the photo.<br>  <br>  2. The second issue sounds like the ISO setting is too high.  Turn it down to avoid noisy images (aka dots).

gzaVGE4Qaa	T-Mobile offers four different prepaid services. <br>  <br>  Their basic pay as you go plan offers four tiers of refill cards. The 10 dollar refill is for 30 minutes, the 25 dollar refill is for 130 minutes, and the 50 dollar refill is for 400 minutes. When you buy the 100 dollar refill, you are enrolled in the Gold Rewards program, which gives you 15 percent more minutes for each card you buy. The 100 dollar card is for 1000 minutes, which already includes the 15 percent bonus. <br>  <br>  The pay per day plan starts with a 1 dollar per day access fee, charged only on days you use the phone. This gives you unlimited night minutes, starting at 7 p.m., and unlimited mobile to mobile minutes. All other calls are 10 cents per minute. <br>  <br>  T-Mobile also has a FlexPay plan. This allows you to choose from among T-Mobile's most popular postpaid calling plans, but pay for them on a prepaid basis. FlexPay customers also have the option of signing a contract, which will entitle them to a subsidy on a handset purchase. <br>  <br>  Finally, T-Mobile offers a Sidekick plan for the popular device. It costs a dollar per day, and includes unlimited text messaging, email, and Web browsing. Calls are billed at 15 cents per minute.

Technically no way. Economic not worth. even some TV model may allow for you to replace a 1080 P display panel, but you never can get full HD result 1080P display, because the circuits do not support to display that. still become 720P . even you in coming signals is 1080 P.

TskZHzZyaa	I have a Verizon HTC 6900 I love.  I heard that with an iPhone you cannot play music and do other applications.  No problem with my HTC 6900.  I also had a 6700 before that.<br>  <br>  I know that the 6700 had an upgrade for Sprint Users but I don't know if it ever did for the Verizon users.  I got the 6900 b/c it had WM6 which was better compatible with the Motorola S9 blue tooth headphones.  I didn't feel like waiting for the upgrade and I'm happy with the thinner phone.  I looked on the Verizon site and there is an upgrade from 5.0 to something called AKU 3.3, whatever that is.  US Cellular I believe caries these too.<br>  <br>  There were "kitchens" that you could upgrade with hackers that updated the software and even hackers that created software to get the phone to act like an iPhone.  I played with them but I'm not that big a techie and I couldn't figure them out.<br>  <br>  if you use a keyboard a lot get the 6800, but having an iPhone you may not use it much.  The 6700 had one I used a lot and the 6900 does not, but I was able to purchase a full-screen keyboard from SPB software for about $12 that I use a lot.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|sIdIIr3Oaa	yes it's ungradable, but i still think the iphone phone is the best, especially if it's unlocked and jailbroken, No other phone can be a wireless keyboard and mouse for my pc like the iphone can.|`|4cMuedpWaa	From Windows Mobile 6.5 to Windows Mobile 7 you should have no problem if they are released within a 6 months/year period in between.<br>  <br>  If more time goes between the two releases, I would suggest you to wait to buy a phone that is released with Windows Mobile 7 pre-installed.<br>  <br>  My first suggestion would be to totally forget Windows Mobile.

w4I9oj2Maa	Sounds like your video controller may have a problem with the resolution settings you're using on the PS3...try 720P output and 1080i output on it and see if the purple lines change or disappear with one of them.<br>  <br>  You could also switch to other inputs too...If you're using HDMI, try the component connections and vice versa.<br>  <br>  Also, if you can find another HD source like a Cable box, you can try that too.<br>  <br>  What that will do for you is to isolate the problem to either the TV set or the PS3...<br>  <br>  Then you can isolate further if the TV set is the problem by trying the HDMI/Component input tests....|`|l7EcMy4laa	its of lose cable to fix it buy anew cable
uQisF0zkaa	The towel trick doesn't really help at all. I think it does more damage than anything. I heard that the towel trick will get it working, but only for (at the most) 15 minutes. Just lent it vent and let it cool down (Don't throw it into the freezer though!!!). Let it cool down for a couple of hours, and during that time lapse:<br>  <br>  ~Check where you had your 360 and make sure it is in a well ventilated area where it will overheat less often<br>  <br>  ~Don't move turn on your 360 while it's cooling and unplug all the cables<br>   <br>  If that doesn't work, contact microsoft or something. Hope this helps.|`|bha1gcUQaa	Two lights just means that your Xbox is too hot. Let it cool down and put it in a ventilated area. Don't use towels as they will probably make things worse and give you the three red lights.
WUgyCmMhaa	the answer is no, to install from the app store you need at least version 2.0, which is a full upgrade, your phone will relock.  The good news is, there is unlock for first gen 2.0 to 2.2 software.  You will be able to upgrade, unlock, use the appstore and cydia (no one uses installer anymore, just cydia now).

They overheat easily and their probably going to stay that way unless everyone stops buying xbox360's because of this, then they'd probably fix it. I have heard of people upgrading their fans in the back. If the fan is more powerful it is a way better chance for it to last longer. Also having a cool non dusty room enviroment for the 360 would probably help.|`|N2p30Mo4aa	If you're thinking of replacing, go for the new arcades.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	When you rewound it, the tape pulled loose from the take-up reel and is now wound completely around the supply reel.  This happens on occasion to video tapes.  Don't try to fix it yourself.  Get another copy of this video or wait for the library to fix it.  Just take it back to the library and explained what happened.  They have staff to do these types of repairs.  There shouldn't be any repair fee or fine against you as this is normal wear and tear.  If you tried to fix it yourself and did more damage you could be charged for that.
oEvHzaUPaa	The x-240. Based on total power output. Without knowing the efficiency of the speakers in question AND the distortion level the 2nd set was rated at, the only way to know for sure is by listening to them and seeing which you prefer. The power rating of the first set is given at 10% distortion, VERY audible. The rule of thumb is to reduce the power output of the amplifier section by a factor of ten to get what is generally considered inaudible distortion (around 1%). (i.e. a 100w amp at 1khz with 10% distortion delivers 10w at 1khz at 1% distortion). With computer speakers they are generally very efficient so they make better use of each watt of power they get.|`|jBIotay5aa	The Logitech X-240 would be the louder one.

G3KX2LDZaa	The store associate should offer to do this when you switch to Verizon.

uQisF0zkaa	This happened to me, this is known as the E-74 error. Mine was a problem with something internal, so see if you can get a return.  It could be an AV cable problem, but if your willing to shell out $20 bucks for a new one, it could be worth it. If you can't get a return, you can (if it is still under warranty) send  it back to Microsoft and get it fixed (this is very expensive, I think it is $140.). Try unplugging everything, blowing in them leave them unplugged for a half an hour, and try it again. If this doesn't work, and you don't want it sent to Microsoft to get it fixed, (I only recommend doing this if you are ABSOLUTELY out of warranty, because it will void any current ones.) you can buy a guide and take it apart. Make sure the guide is good, usually the good ones will have a video with them.

This error means that the Xbox 360 has insufficent power to function properly. This can be caused by an error in the hard drive or the fans that make them suck up too much power, it can also be caused if you have unnecessary accessories attached to the console like an external fan unit. Attempt to remove unnecessary accessories first, and then necessary components such as the hard drive and USB devices. If you have any case mods you may want to investigate those as well.<br>  <br>  E69: Hard Drive Error...

If you can afford it high definition. camera effects (put them on when you edit the video). you need to be able to mount a tripod, <br>  <br>  what are you going to video? family friends or a little more? there are so many things to consider but it could change depending on what you are going to use it for<br>  <br>  Have a look here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video-cameras.suite101.com/article.cfm/camcorder_formats" rel="nofollow">http://video-cameras.suite101.com/articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/columbiaisa/camcord_formats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/columbiaisa/cam...</a><br>  <br>  Also go to <br>  <br>  www.videohelp.com   Good site for information about camcorders and software<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR
N2p30Mo4aa	unfortunately data sometimes gets corrupted (ie. turning wii off while saving). You'll probably have to delete the save file....or back it up to storage card, run smash brothers and see if it works.  If it does, then sorry, your save file is no good|`|Xt31HyvWaa	This means your data has been corrupted to fix the problem im afraid you will have to delete the data and start again.
6GIrW5eWaa	It appears that the question is missing a couple of details. I will attempt to help but if you could add additional it will help.<br>  <br>  I can only strum? up? Down? What is it not doing? I hate to offer up advice to say take it apart but the strum bar basically is a rocker that sits above two switches. When you strum down it pushes the button on top of the switch and vice versa when you strum up. If you are strumming down and it is not registering the strum or up for that matter it might be that the switch is defective. You can swap out the two switches up for down or again vice versa if you know what you are doing. Now if the issue is that the strum bar is not returning to position then you have an issue with the spring that basically sits between the switch and the strum bar (rocker) again open it up and replace or return the spring to position. Understand that you do this at your own doing. I am only trying to provide suggestions or what you can do or what to look for. Good Luck
