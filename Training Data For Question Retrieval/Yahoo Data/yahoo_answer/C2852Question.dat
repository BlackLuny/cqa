20090227152203AAgabHR	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Is it ok for me to go to a restaurant bar to watch a hockey game?	I kinda need to go out somewhere, but no one seems to like what I like so I'm thinking of just going to a local bar to just watch some hockey...by myself. Is that risky, pitiful or just a stupid idea?      Ps, I'm deffinatly not looking to meet any special someones since I've heard it being said that bars are not the best place to meet potential boyfriends, and I look like I'm 16 anyways so no one would be interested anyways. I just maybe wana chat about the game.

20090227162203AA4nffm	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Ordering Orange Juice at a Bar?	When I was 18, I tried drinking red wine. I found that I got very red, my heart rate increase, etc. I spoke to my physician about this and he told me that I have a genetic disorder that made it difficult for my body to process alcohol. He recommended that I avoid alcohol completely otherwise I will increase the risk of getting cancer of the esophagus or liver.      Suppose I went out to the bar for drinks with co-workers on a Friday night. Would it be socially acceptable for me to order something like orange juice or would e.g. females perceive me as weak?      What about ginger ale? I need to know a common, simple drink to order at the bar that has zero alcohol.       Furthermore, my knowledge of bar culture is very basic, almost nonexistent, so you will need to explain as if I am a beginner.

20090227164823AAerXwd	Dining Out;Fast Food	McDonalds French fry?	Okay, Now I went to McDonalds several times in the past few months; I get a fry and why is it that the fries are half of the container, like they are in the back eatting out of it. They are skimping on the fries, I take it back and ask them to fill it up, like what the heck. I paid for large. Make your containers smaller so I can atleast feel I am getting my fill. I tell them don't advertise a full fry container if they are only giving half. False Advertisement.
