kHb3480aaa	a los 12 a?os es comun entrar en depresion porque estas comenzando a vivir y ver las cosas mas seriamente, pero lo que hoy te esta ahogando ma?ana lo vas a ver mas sencillo    por favor no vayas a cometer una tonteria contra ti misma    vales mucho ten autoestima    si el chavo que te gusta no te hace caso, mandalo al demonio hay mas en este planeta    si a tu hermana le gusta, pues uuuy ni modo esta igualita que tu, a ninguna le hace caso    si tu mama te dice loca, pues no escuches    si tus amigas no te hacen caso, ni siquiera son tus amigas, buscate otras que valgan la pena    si te van a meter a un internado, pues de amenazas a realidad hay muuuuuuuucho trecho.    si no te hablas con tu papa, intenta acercarte a el    veras que todo se soluciona haciendote un coco wash, untate de mantequilla peque?a, que todo se te resbale.|`|HntXbBCSaa	Pero vamos a ver morirte por un chico como sabe s que lo quieres de verdad eres muy joven tienes  un a?o mas que mi hija, ella a mi me lo cuenta todo, dile a tu madre que quieres hablar con ella y preguntarle por que te llama loca una madre no llama loca a su hija con respecto a tus amigas no deben ser muy amigas cuando hacen lo que estas contando cambia de amigas y tu hermana se preguntale por que te hace eso que tengas mucha suerte y besitos.|`|xOHYsHVuaa	no le des tu msn a nadie que no conoscas se intentaran aprovechar de que eres joven y estas muy confundida a esa edad yo pase por algo asi la unica forma de superarlo es ser fuerte y utilizar la venganza como motor de todo si vaz mas mal en la escuela pienza si eres mejor a ellos en unos a?os ellos solo serviran cafe y venderan hamburgesas y no podran verte a los ojos a tus padres igual y un dia podras reclamarles todo y ese dia seras muy pero muy feliz|`|d125a6bf1ace32bc1ab8a0670c229500aa	Se fuerte tu eres quien decide como enfrentarte a tus problemas no es facil, pero no estas sola Dios esta contigo    suerte|`|zzo568ulaa	mira yo tambien pase por una etapa en la que queria estar muerta ya que pensaba que nadie me queria y que solo serbia para molestar a las personas pero alguien me dijo : noo komo que muerta si la vida es muy bonita y ay mucha gente que te quiere...  tal ves tu mama te insulte , tu ermana esta enamorada del mismo chavo que tu  y no ables con tu papa , pero yo se que si te mueres alguien te va extra?ar y ese alguien sera porque te queria mucho pero no tubo el valor de asercarte a ti. Lo que trato de desir es que siempre, puedes pasar por cosas malas pero no ay que rendirse ay que luchar por lo que quieres hasta conseguirlo y ser feliz tal ves no seas feliz con tus amigas entonses buscate otras el mundo es demasiado grande para estar solo (;    agregame: ale_saenz93@hotmail.com|`|9574caf3fd628d3794b0cb75b607dd05aa	holaaa!! Bueno, primero coincido com algunos que ya firmaron, que seria necesario charlar mas. Si queres podes mandarme mensaje y te doy mi direccion de msn asi chateamos. No soy psicologa ni nada por el estilo pero si puedo ayudarte, encantada!  Primero, se que no sos ninguna mocosa, y que el chico te encanta. Si tu hermana tiene una edad similar, es muy normal que a las dos les guste el mismo. Es algo que nos pasa a todas las chicas a esa edad. Cuando yo tenia 12, me gustaba el mismo chico que a todas mis mejores amigas.. y realmente era un problema. El tema es que tengas en claro que lo mas importante es tu relacion con tu hermana. Y que si el te da bola a vos o a ella, las cosas sigan bien entre uds.  Con respecto a tu mama, habria que ver porque te dice que estas loca. Como te estas comportando?? Si estas siendo rebelde, probablemente tu mama lo diga porque las estas volviendo loca a ella. Y no te preocupes que no te van a mandar a ningun internado. No se de que pas sos, pero si sos de argentina, no hay posibilidades de que te internen. y si sos de otro pais de latinoamerica creo que tampoco..  Que no le hables a tu papa no esta bien. Sea lo que sea que te moleste es tu papa.  A veces a tu edad no nos damos cuenta de porque nos dicen las cosas. Pero es necesario aceptarlas, porque en el futuro vas a ver que esos cuidados que tienen nuestros padres, que en su momento nos molestaron, despues fueron para bien.   Creo que mas alla de las cosas malas que hagan los demas, necesitas un cambio dentro tuyo.  Con esta depresion y la mala onda, tu chico no te va a dar ni la hora!!   Empeza a cumplir con la escuela, anda aunque no te guste, si tus amigas no te dan bola, conoce gente nueva, socializa con otras chicas. Tal vez las amigas que tenes ahora no sean las mas adecuadas. Tal vez necesites un cambio.  Habla con tu papa. Despues de una discusion, pelea o algo que nos molesta, lo mejor es volver a hablar como si nada. Como si estuviera todo bien. vas a ver que la situacion mejora. que el ambiente va a ser mas calido y no tan tenso.  (yo asumi que vivis con tu papa. pero si no es asi, es igual. no podes no hablarle.)  tmb asumi que no le hablas por decision propia. pero si no es asi y es tu papa el que no te habla, demostra que no sos una mocosa (como nos dijiste) y habla con el.  Sos chica. Tenes una edad hermosa para divertirte, pasarla bien. No lo arruines con pavadas, haciendote problema por todo. deprimiendote.  Hay cosas mucho mas graves en la vida. y 12 a?os se tiene solo una vez.   si queres charlar mandame mensaje  saludos  y suerte!|`|SzBVE8Z7aa	mira a mi me pasa algo muy parecido a ti, tengo 17 a?os y estoy enamorada de dos chicos a la vez, me gustan los 2 igual, muchsimo, pero con uno no puedo estar porque mi to no me deja, porque es su amigo y yo siempre ser su sobrina peque?a y no me deja vivir as. y el otro vive en mi otra aldea en donde esta la casa de mis abuelos y nunca lo veo solo por msn, mi prima se pone celosa cuando mi tio no se entera y estoy con el primero que dije y se cabrea, y eso que tiene novio ademsemas tambinmbien le gusta otra, asi que cuando no esta ni mi tio ni mi prima el esta mitad conmigo y despues se larga con la otra... y el que vive en el  pueblo de mis otros abuelos hace 2 meses que no lo veo, solo nos dejamos mensajes instantaneos en el msn porque nunca estamos los dos juntos, con mi madre nunca me lleve bien, porque siempre me trato como una ni?a peque?a y  no le importo tanto como mi hermano, y no me deja salir por ahi si no es con mis amigas de siempre y como ellas tampoco salen... y mi padre es mi unico apoyo a veces, creo que son casos parecidos, y yo tambien kiero morirme muchas veces, pero pienso que en el futuro estare con alguno de esos chicos y sere feliz aun que viva sola y todo eso y pienso en lo que me hace feliz ahora y pienso en que hay muchisimos casos peores que el mio asi que... no te quejes anda que hay casos peores y la vida esta pa vivirla y disfrutarla a tope!!!!!!  espero haberte ayudado besos!!!!! xao|`|0JnfYB3vaa	No te mueras... todos pasamos por esto y sobrevivimos. Lo primero es que tomes las cosas una a una. Lo del chico... volteaa ver a los que s te hacen caso, sobre tu mam...est dise?ada para educarte, no para comprenderte; sobre tu pap, dile lo quieres y explcale lo que sientes. No voy a copadecerte, eso no sirve de nada, es mejor  asumir que la vida no es siempre como la queremos pero que puede vivirse con mas gozo y menos dramatismo. Te firmo con sangre que tus paps te aman y en menos de tres meses tendrs un novio que te amar tanto como t al l. Tambi{en estoy segura que tienes amigas sinceras... quiz no todas, pero al menos un par. No busques amores imposibles, mejor busca a los que si te quieren y HAZ UNA LSTA DE LAS COSAS BUENAS QUE TE HA DADO LA VIDA...

5apN0UOWaa	She's trying to prove that pot is bad for your judgment, even in moderation  |`|Gy9kt139aa	I think she's trying to be "different" and artsy like a lot of celebrities these days are doing. They want to cause a stir and get more attention when their babies are first born, but they fail to plan ahead and think of their child's future. Gwen Stefani did not realize that one day her baby boy is going to grow up and have to introduce himself to work colleagues as Zuma Rosdale.  |`|73R5Pcr5aa	the kid is gonna hate his name when he grows up i don't understand why celebs do this to their kids.|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Kingston isn't really that normal a name either, but yeh, Zuma is weird. I just hope that these celebrities kids have ambitions to be actors or rock stars when they are older because good luck to them trying to be taken seriously as anything else.|`|BEequNDOaa	I wish I knew! But, its a pretty terrible name  Wonder if she realizes that Nesta is a welsh girls name meaning 'Pure'|`|AA11519707	For those who don't know, Zuma is a famous beach in Malibu, California.  That's where the name came from.  When the name first came out, they said what every part of it referred to.    As far as Kingston, he was named after Kingston, Jamaica, where No Doubt recorded their Rock Steady album (the one with Hey Baby on it).    I'll admit, I wasn't a big fan of the name regardless of knowing where the components came from.  I think celebrities just feel pressured to not name their kids anything remotely normal, since so many other celebrities name their kids something stupid.  I think it comes down to being "creative" people (musicians, actors, magicians, etc), so a traditional name doesn't fit with their personality.|`|Kbz7GG1faa	I Love, Love , Love Gwen. I knew she named her baby Zuma, but I didn't know it was a boy...I figured it was a girl. Zuma for a boy? It's wrong for any sex. So sad. Picture this:     "do you Zuma, take thee to be your wife...?" What a joke!|`|9RoWYSK8aa	YEah- thats just not cool. You have to consider what the kid is going to put up with in school. Im starting to think these famous people are just making up names for the sake of being original- Zuma- Ive never heard of EVER!|`|5Upeuelraa	Celebrity parents don't realize that their poor kids can never live up to the stupid fantasies they associate with these "unique" names. They're just kids! Not canvases or artistic experiments! All they'll want when they start school is to make friends. That'll be hard enough coming from a famous family; why not place one more obstacle in their way, right? It's pretty selfish and ignorant. Maybe Zuma is a normal male name in another culture, but what about the culture her son is actually going to grow up in?  If she wants to be "creative", she needs to write a song! Not experiment on her kids! 
2RygPGRaaa	The morning after pill is TOTALLY ABORTION! Any church will say that any type of birth control that does not allow a fertilized egg to implant is an abortifacient and is wrong.   Even the IUD, although the advertisements won't admit it, cause abortion by not allowing an egg to implant.  If there is anything in the uterus it tricks the body into thinking it is pregnant, therefore, not accepting implantation of fertilized eggs. Years ago, before birth control, women used to put chicken bones into their uterus' as a form of birth control. Same theory as the IUD.    Even in cases of Rape and Incest...abortion is abortion. Although that baby may be unwanted by it's mother, that little person, didn't choose whose womb it'd start it's life in. That baby shouldn't have to pay the price for someone else's sin.     By the way...hope you stand up in the national life chain this Sunday on Life chain Sunday! http://nationallifechain.org|`|903870f5a8058e4e2098147be4687cb4aa	Your looking at this the wrong way the morning after pill is to stop becoming pregnant. The sperm has to meet the egg to become pregnant so if the pill is in effective the sperm can't reach the egg so there for your not killing any thing expect the sperm from hitting the egg. And it is a women choice to have an abortion if you like or not|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	I think it's a great thing. It's not abortion because it prevents the egg from implanting in the uterine wall and therefore, the cells of the egg do not duplicate. One egg cell is not a baby, sorry.|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Plan B or the Morning After Pill is not an abortion pill. It will not stop pregnancy if you are already pregnant. It works like birth control pills, are you against all forms of birth control??????? G|`|TlA2z5XJaa	It isn't abortion, it prevents a pregnancy from occuring, it doesn't end one.   Why don't you think of it this way, taking the morning after pill can prevent an abortion from occuring in the future.|`|hAuemuWTaa	the morning after pill stops u from falling pregnant u r not pregnant its just stop the egg to be as fertile, i never use a pill or i dont belive in abortions.|`|Vdsq21Ltaa	I think it's a good product. I've used it personally. I don't see it as abortion.|`|fbdo2XcOaa	While I agree that it should not be used as a form of birth control, I don't view the morning after pill is anything like an abortion. I believe the idea behind the morning after pill is to prevent fertilization and the embryo from ever forming. You are not instantaneously pregnant right after you have sex, it takes a little while for the egg to be fertilized and embed in your uterus. People make mistakes and I think that is why its available. I have been guilty of not making the wisest decisions before, but fortunately have never become preganant.|`|GkhNUHofaa	i dont view it as abortion because all it does is make you have a period right away and if you take it the next day like you're supposed to then fertilization more than likely hasnt even happened yet...and i am very pro life so believe me if it were something you took after you knew for sure you were pregnant that'd be another  story for me.|`|AA11519707	I agree with you.  It's for irresponsible women who want a quick fix for making a dumb decision.  I definitely agree that if you willingly have sex, they you're making the choice to risk pregnancy.  You shouldn't get bailed out, otherwise you don't learn your lesson.    Like you said, acceptable for rape & incest victims.|`|AA11200457	Well yes you are intitle to your opinion too,Well there is alot for it and alot against it too.Many young girls give-in to guys for many reasons.  Afraid of loosing the guy,peer presure,afraid of not being one of the in crowd so to speak.The guy tells her he really loves her,she really beleives him and gives-in,and when he gets what he walks out the door.Then afterwards the girl is left holding the bundle so to speak..And the responsibity of bring-up a child,alone....The four hourly feeds,crying all night with wind,high fevers,and then have to get help to get to hospitals in the middle of the nights.And to top it all off the poor girl is worn-out,and it doesn't finish there she has too,clean the house,do the washing,feed the baby,bath the baby, and so on.It never stops for a mother......Then when things start to get a little easier with the child.The so-Called father steps in and expect parent rights,and wants to be a dad....When he really gave up those rights when he walked away ,when then girl first got pregnant.So wake-up and smell the flowers,can you really blame girls for taking the morning after Pill,exspecially when they have to go through carrying the child for nine months,plus on top of all that give birth to the child.Exspecially if they are not ready for motherhood.There is enough young children out there suffering because of not enough thought giving to and responsiblity taken for there actions on both parties in volved where sex is concerned.|`|QzVKycm4aa	i think you should only use it if you were raped, if you have sex and you think you are prego i dont think you should use it............

Kayleigh is like Hanukkah --  it is spelled 800,000 different ways and none of them look right.  The eigh doesn't look good on any name...it looks cutesy pretentious, never professional.    Sydney is one of those trendy cute names...again, not professional.    April or Abby are all right, but sound more common than elegant.    I've known some Tiffany's that are very professional, but most of them seem like trashy stripperesque women (if you have watched I Love New York, you will know what I mean).|`|aRMsI01jaa	April is pretty!|`|T9SS5QBmaa	Tiffany  Sydney  Vanessa  |`|Wv8aLMyiaa	Kayleigh
AA11519707	As someone else said, beau is normally thought of as masculine (especially when there is an Isa*belle*).  From that aspect, the name seems like a contradiction as soon as you hear it.    Plus, there was a real harpy on The Biggest Loser a few seasons ago who didn't do the name Isabeau any favors.    As a general rule, I'd stay away from any name beginning with "Is A"...there's just so many unkind ways to end that.  Especially with B endings for a girl.|`|99e36b9074a459fba731d3fbd94ee4f8aa	Hi from France ?    I don't like it however it's your opinion which is important, not mine or from people  ...

My name is Isabella and they usually also call me Izzy but with the "y"  ^_^|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	love it!|`|xzHhp2niaa	Beau is the masculine of belle, so why would you use the masculine form? There is a reason why the traditional names are Isabelle or Isabella.

Y lo ms importante: desde el momento que existe un ser dentro de ti, como madre, tienes la obligacin de ayudar a que ese ser VIVA. Se supone que es una madre la primera en defender a su hijo, no en querer matarlo.   Si tuviste el valor de tener relaciones, debiste tambin pensar que poda resultar en un embarazo a destiempo. Y ahora deberas tener el valor de afrontar esa co nsecuencia. Si no lo quieres tener contigo, busca que sea adoptado por una familia que est buscando un hijo. NO le quites la oportunidad de vivir solo porque t no lo quieres. Hay parejas que luchan a?os y nunca pueden tener un hijo propio. COn mucha seguridad, los haras muy felices y evitarias convertirte en cmplice de un asesinato. Y peor an, de alguien tan indefenso y tan dependiente.

Est compuesta de las mismas hormonas de las pldoras anticonceptivas (estrgeno y progestina), pero en mayores dosis.     ?Cmo funciona?     Interviene antes de que se efecte el embarazo, dependiendo del da del ciclo menstrual:     Si la relacin sexual es antes de la ovulacin, la pldora impide que el vulo sea liberado del ovario, demorando la ovulacin.   Si la relacin sexual es durante o despus de la ovulacin, la pldora evita que el espermatozoide fecunde al vulo.     ?En qu casos debe tomarse?     Se recomienda tomar en tres casos: si tuviste relaciones sexuales sin proteccin, si fall o se rompi tu mtodo anticonceptivo de barrera (condn o diafragma), o si hubo una violacin. Debes llamar a tu gineclogo en cuanto hayas tenido relaciones sexuales sin proteccin, pues cuanto antes tomes las pldoras de emergencia, mayores sern las probabilidades de prevenir un embarazo.    ?Cunta eficacia tiene?    Cuando es utilizada antes de las 72 horas posteriores a la relacin sexual sin proteccin, se tiene un 98% de seguridad de no quedar embarazada.

Es importante que tu mdico te d un antiemtico para evitar que elimines la pldora. Es indispensable que recurras a tu gineclogo si tienes sntomas como: dolor, enrojecimiento o inflamacin en las piernas, extremidades adormecidas, dolores severos en el abdomen, problemas para respirar, visin borrosa o prdida de la visin, debilidad, aturdimiento, sangrado irregular, o ausencia de menstruacin despus de 21 das de tomar la pldora.      |`|pMKYocTJaa	UNA MANERA SEGURA Y REAL DE CONFIRMAR UN EMBARAZO ES POR MEDIO DE UN TEST O PRUEBA DE LABORATORIO    TODAS LAS PRUEBAS DE EMBARAZO TIENE EL MISMO PRINCIPIO (LA DETECCION DE LA HORMONA DEL EMBARAZO HCG)QUE SOLO SE PRESENTA EN EL EMBARAZO O DEBIDO A LA ADMINISTRACION DE CIERTOS MEDICAMENTOS (POR EJEMPLOS LOS DE FERTILIDAD)    El test (presentado en forma de stick o de varilla) contiene anticuerpos que reaccionan en presencia de la hormona de embarazo.

Suggestions:    Riley  Rhane (rain)  Wassime  Charlie  Edward  Cameron  Abhick (a-bick)|`|JLAW7kKSaa	I think Anthony is a strong middle name.  As for Khomil, I said Co-mill when I read it the first time.  I don't dislike the name, I just don't think it fits in the strong category.  Sorry.|`|J2gr1ogHaa	ummm Anthony strong yes.  Khomil??? That just sounds made up and feminine like Camille    try again|`|WRSxPVDUaa	Personally I don't really think there is such a thing as a bad name itself- it is more the reason WHY you chose the name that makes it good or bad. Where does Khomil come from? Personally I just love K names. Maybe thats because my brother is Kaiden.|`|96ojhoXvaa	I LIKE THIS NAME ALOT.  ANTHONY IS CLASSIC BUT VERY MASCULINE, ALSO I KNOW A FEW ANTHONY'S, AND WHEN I HEAR THAT NAME, IT REMINDS ME OF A SEDUCTIVE ROMANCING KIND OF GUY...WHICH IS NOT BAD! THE NAME KHOMIL SOUNDS GREAT...IT LOOKS UNUSUAL SPELLING WISE, BUT I DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM PRONUNCIATING IT.  YOU DID A GOOD JOB ON PICKING OUT THIS NAME!|`|GFjI6OJEaa	Its very unique Its not for me but that up to you!|`|AA11519707	I'm not a huge fan of Khomil.  Anthony is okay though.    An easy rule of thumb is that you shouldn't have to tell people how to pronounce a name.  Otherwise your child will have to do it constantly.|`|WBV16h9jaa	No, I don't think the name is strong, but I think anyone called Khomil would need to be strong to get through life with that name.    I really like Anthony, though.
YRGHqbkjaa	Antonio should stick. The name shouldn't necessarily be changed to Tony look at Antonio Banderas, no-one calls him Tony Banderas.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	I like Antonio..but like my dad he will be nicknamed "Tony"..How about Antwon? I like Stefan very much. Stefan Antonio or Antwon Sergio are nice combos!|`|AA10064810	Peter is a great name.  I don't like Sergio, unless chosen because of family connections or you just adore it, because it will seem so unusual.  Stefan is nice, too.  Like Urkel's cousin.  Antonio will definitely be Tony.      My aunt picked a name for her son that nobody would ever think of saying with the eee ending, Mark.  He is called Markey by almost everyone in the family.  See!!  .  As for the name being used in the US, go ahead and use any name you want.  |`|J9Tbun7naa	Out of all your options I like Peter the best. I really don't like Sergio but that's because I used to work with a really creepy man named Sergio who has like 20 something kids all over the world and does nothing to support them (true story).  I don't mind Antonio but I think someone along the lines will call him Tony|`|AA11519707	My best friend in elementary school was named Antonio.  I think he eventually started going by Tony at about age 10 or 11 (so you might be fighting a losing battle on Tony).    I'm just wondering if what heritage your family is (just since Antonio and Sergio seem hispanic, but Peter & Stefan seem Swedish, so they seem like a disparity).    Personally I don't like Sergio, but that's because I had a roommate in college named Sergio who I absolutely despised.    I like Peter, but Stefan can be hit or miss (probably because I immediately think of the tennis player Stefan Edberg, so if the kid doesn't look like Edberg, the name would seem odd to me)|`|Pgsq2GfBaa	Antoine or Antonio, people will call him antonio if you do. most people will call the child the name you introduce him with. I have a friend with a daughter named Sophia...i have never called her anything but sophia because that's what her mum introduced her as, i would never call her sophie unless i heard her parents use it, which i haven't. He may want to be called Tony when he is a teenager, but that decision will be his.

wZAeBisbaa	Well, how did you let that happen?  Isn't contraception your responsibility?  When the baby is born, make sure you get a DNA test to prove that she's the mother.  Then take her to court for child support.   But don't expect her to be understanding when you get morning sickness or backaches - it's not her problem.   Don't expect her to stick around and help with the baby, either. She's paying for it. Why should she have to take on any more responsibility?   You're the one who will have to miss school, stay home instead of having fun with your friends, and take care of this child for the rest of your life.

YVasdve0aa	You should be fine to work out.  I worked out my whole pregnancy.  As a matter of fact I ran on my eliptical machine for 30 minutes the day before my son was born.  Exercising is actually healthy for pregnant women.  My OBGYN said that women who exercise tend to has less complications, easier deliveries, and healthier babies.  Try not to lift anything more than 15 pounds though.  This does cause a lot of strain and can sometimes lead to a miscarriage.  If you do want to lift weights use free weights 15 pounds or less and just increase reps.     I will say that I spent two days at Bush Gardens riding every ride there the day before I found out I was pregnant.  Try not to worry.  If it makes you feel better, go a little lighter on your workout this next week.  The 7th isn't that far off.  |`|Yx3ZRvuKaa	You can still workout as long as you are not overheating or straining yourself.  If you absolutely do not want to tone down the workouts which would be silly if a life is at stake, just do low weight and high reps.  This method actually works better at burning fat and toning muscle so you are getting an advantage in both areas.  You should not miscarry from this.  I worked out frequently until I had complications and was training for the nike marathon when I got prego.|`|2054aa878440790e10c76550a8bc89a7aa	You should defiantly go see your doctor... that may have not been a condom, you never know. Exercising will not cause a miscarriage if you've been exercising all along, but if you are, you might want to tone it down a bit and keep your calories at a reasonable level. Unless you don't want to be pregnant.  Good luck!|`|EpfVsCa2aa	i would wait and see if i had a period, but i dont think it can harm the baby, 
tAKC0Cskaa	Our son was diagnosed with reflux at 4 weeks - I'd mention it the next time you see your doctor. Also, we put our son on Similac Alimentum and that seemed to help him quite a bit! Thankfully! We also were told by the doctor to put 1 tsp of rice cereal in his 4 ounce bottle of formula to help weigh it down in his belly.    It's tough to watch this happen to someone so tiny and fragile. But, it sounds like it's a common case of reflux.......... which most babies grow out of. But, in the meantime, check out the Similac website and see if the Alimentum is something you may want to consider.     Then...check with your insurance company to see if they cover infant formula - some cover it for a full year!! |`|hrMhhB4Saa	only unless he ends up on his tummy withint the first hour aftering eating|`|HcMvtMT7aa	Not abnormal at all.  To tell you the truth, all formulas are basically the same, except for some are made of soy for the lactose intolerant babies. Changing the formula usually will not help.  As long as baby gains weight, isn't in pain and seems happy then all is well.  My baby is nearly 5 months old and spits up like 5 times a day.  Our babies are what doctors call "happy spitters".  If you fear that she might have a milk allergy, my doctor told me that when my baby poops, when I pull the diaper away and if there are strings of mucus that stretch from the baby's bottom to the diaper, it means she has a milk allergy.  The reason she spits up is because her digestive system isn't fully matured yet.  It happened when the sphincter (muscle) that holds the contents of the stomach accidentally opens, therefore causes baby to spit up.  If she every seems in pain, to swallow or spit up, then she may have acid reflux.  The Doc can prescribe an anti acid for baby.|`|weA0Xdszaa	Some babies spit up more then others.  I am lucky, my little girl (3 weeks old) barely ever spits up. She drinks Nestle Good Start. Please do not try the rice cereal in the bottle trick unless your doctor says so...  Good luck! I'm sure there is nothing to worry about ;)|`|aqvzWF17aa	First of all, hopefully you've kept the pediatrician updated.  Normally if she's gaining weight then all is well.  My second son was spitting up a lot and at approx. 4 months took him in to the Dr. to just make sure all was still well....Mom's instinct I guess because he didn't seem uncomfortable.  He ended up having a "swallowing dysfunction" which basically means that the swallowing process wasn't yet mature for him.  Not a whole lot you can do but one of the things they recommended was the formula with rice cereal already added.  Good for reflux also.  The additional weight of it kept more of it down.  Also feeding him more slowly...burping and rubbing his back in between....to give the formula time to settle.  Good luck.|`|2054aa878440790e10c76550a8bc89a7aa	I'd say it's nothing. Just bring it up to your doctor at your next check up. My daughter did that a lot as well, we just had to burp her longer and she was fine. Spitting up will happen... 3 times is not a lot. I had a friend who's son actually threw up the formula after like an hour, it came out in chunks! Gross. When that happens, then you should be concerned.   No, it's not abnormal.  GOOD LUCK!|`|vnsHdVlLaa	I don't think it's abnormal because spit up happens with babies.  Why don't you try the soy formula?  I had problems with milk based formula when my baby was younger.  I changed to soy formula after the first few weeks and spit up is now a thing of the past.  It took her a couple feedings to get used to the taste but now she loves it.  The only time anything ever comes out of her mouth is when she either eats too much or she's drooling.|`|jmJGElAKaa	Our daughter spit up a lot and it was gross! She had acid reflux so we tried to limit the acidic foods like apples from her diet.    www.FreeInfantSamples.com

I had a c-section and he almost passed out!|`|69DjSUVAaa	My husband was deffo emotional.|`|nYI8eB0Baa	Well my husband did not full on cry..but there was some tears of joy!|`|TcTXcOyDaa	Real men don't let other people define them.  You sound sensitive - and that's ok with me - but my opinion (and others) shouldn't matter that much.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	My husband cried at both births, they were tears of great joy.   He doesn't cry that often, though it's more often then I do.|`|BypjotRpaa	kinda..his eyes got watery but i never saw an actual cry..|`|ly59dQ3gaa	No.  Lots of men cry.  My husband didn't boohoo cry, but he did get very emotional and 'teary eyed.'  He's a very manly man, but wouldn't be ashamed to cry at something like that.|`|O95pKlPiaa	Yes. Man up!    additional - yeah it's true I don't have any kids. I was joking, congrats on your sons and and future daughter.  Hope I didn't make you cry with what I said ;)|`|EeGgovyCaa	Oh god no, my SO cried the pretty much during all the ultrasound appts and when he held his son and daughter for the first time. My SO looks so big and tough, but he is such a softy when it comes to his kids. I love it, it was so sweet to see that side of him. |`|eXsR8Gx5aa	He would deny it but there was a tear in his eye.    I had an emergency section and they called him round the curtain and said come and tell mum what she's got.    He said "It's a boy!" and there was deffo a bit of a broken voice and watery eye going on!    When he returned with our son wrapped in a towel it was my turn - oooh I'm welling up just remembering it!|`|fRIEHBJOaa	no. my fiance didn't cry, but i didnt cry either.  i cried after a few months, when i just stared at my son...i just couldnt believe i gave birth and i have a son. it was surreal. still is sometimes. i dont think my fiance has cried ..if he has, i havent seen it. but every now and then we do a group hug and he sayas he's so lucky to have a wonderful girl and a perfect baby.  we have an 8 month old baby boy (he will be on sunday).  it's our first baby and it's been a challenge!|`|hrMhhB4Saa	his eyes watered up but ididnt see any actual tears fall. no|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	Well the only reason my husband did is BC after 22 hrs of labor they finally decided to do a C Section and I felt them starting to cut on me( BIG OUCH). He cried after everyone left them room and it was just me him and the beautiful baby boy we had just had. He said he was so worried about the baby and I and that he doesnt know if he couldve took all of that as long as I did. I also went through 13 hrs or more of my labor without pain meds. But I was trying to go completely natural. Now he wants a girl! |`|LhvKTYftaa	Mine cried so hard that he scared my bff and my parents!!  I was still "asleep" as I had an emergency c-section, but my parents and bffr said that it was the sweetest thing!!|`|1S7uXsInaa	I would not say CRY, but he did tear up when they were born and when we has ultrasounds done.|`|xPMib1A1aa	My sister fiance cried when my sister gave birth, i think its a naturall thing, and its the shock that uve become a father|`|4BeKVZsPaa	hey dude, it's all good. You love those littluns yes, then crying at their birth is so natural, i can't think of anything more natural.  congratulations|`|96af43a6ab3bf4045a9898acf5153bb9aa	Yes he did and then he wooped for joy. Actually when we found out that we were having twins, he was in hysterics fro about 3 days (laughter) and then came down to earth. Even now as they grow up and when he is really proud, he lets a twinkle come to his eyes. I love that about him|`|eCJKbAbXaa	My partner didn't and i would have liked him too. Although, we have been together 7 years and i have never seen him cry. He is just not very emotional i guess. I think it is lovely when men show their emotions like that.|`|W9kDyyjFaa	No. Not the only man. I also did when my Son was born. Man should cry just like expression of any emotion, it is healthy and normal especially at such an incredible moment as when you become a Father. I would go as far as to say it is abnormal not to.|`|AA12279950	My husband cried at the birth of our son.  That was right after he'd picked himself up off the floor from a dead faint!  (Seriously - it was a true sitcom moment!).  But yes, he did cry.  We both did.|`|9ExQMhWCaa	my partner had a few joyful tears when DD was born, but it was also quite a traumatic last hour, so partly he was relived, but he didnt with our son.|`|EnfChrwXaa	Huh.  Mine was asleep in the waiting room.  I'd been in labour for such a long time he was exhausted (HE was exhausted!!!!) - it seemed a shame to disturb him.|`|uxItOSkmaa	Yep.  So far, the only time I've seen my husband cry was right after we got married & at the birth of our son.  Happy tears are incredibly moving.|`|AA10524393	My husband never cried...( then again, I was alone when I had our child)    The only time my husband has shown emotion in the 5 years we have been together, is when I threatened to leave him for not showing any emotion ( never saying I love you, ect...only showing mean emotions)   Then, he actually said I love you, and cried.     I think its good for men to show emotion.|`|bca876807397da6a3e779abc5c4a2585aa	My fiance cried more than the baby when she was born, its a emotional time so don't worry, I think its very sweet!|`|0DUzshQUaa	My husband was very emotional when our son was born. When I was in labor and during my emergency c-section. When he got to hold our son and carry him to the nursery he cried. He said the two most happiest days of his life was his wedding day (in which he cried through the entire ceremony) and the birth of his son. So you are not the only man that has cried at the birth of your child. If my husband had not cried I would have thought he was not happy or something was wrong with him. Good Luck with baby  3.|`|6auqS9pLaa	nope - but he was a nervous wreck!|`|5EiShLZZaa	No he didn't cry.  The only time I've ever seen my hubby cry is when our dog died at the age of 12, he was our child before we had our son.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I've never seen my husband shed a tear... I don't think he's cried since he was 14 or so (we joke around all the time that there's something wrong with him). I'm highly emotional, and was hoping he'd show more emotion when my son was born, but he didn't. I'm slowly learning that it's just who he is and he shows his love in many other ways. A lot of my friends husbands cried when their little one was born though... you aren't alone. Nothin' wrong with it either :-) Congrats your girl on the way! |`|qtJUL2O1aa	I'm not a woman but man and I do cry. I'm 27 and not a parent yet, but I think that about "Men shouldn't cry" is stupid!..    MEN, DO CRY!|`|gJqCWt7waa	my husband cried at the birth of our son..... I think its fine when a man cries over something like that - men are allowed to have emotions|`|7aXYGpKtaa	Yes he did, and I love him for it! |`|f62baddedbfa756edefe21d25eaad61baa	my husband is not the emotional type but he cried when both of our daughters were born. I think life has a way of getting the best of you sometimes and you just can;t help it. Nothing is wrong with a man crying...it shows he has feeling too! |`|2b0f244e33ba995db9ecc78eed298655aa	My hubby cried when our daughter was born ... I thought it was cute!!!|`|c7e0ba978ab9cd56380ff8d2b3248973aa	Absolutely not, my husband cried at the birth of our children, not sobbing and weeping, but very definitely tearful and emotional.  It is a very spiritual time when you meet your baby for the 1st time, and it is bound to make you emotional.  I am very lucky my husband will show his emotions as he feels them, he even cried when our grand daughter was born and we heard her 1st cry over the telephone.  Good for you for being secure enough in yourself to be able to show your feelings, and good luck to you on the birth of your daughter, be warned there will be more tears before she has grown.  |`|zC5LGhZCaa	I like guys like you that are able to show their sensitive side, when a baby is born it is special it is normal that it effects you and that you cry or have water in your eyes, you are sweet :)|`|QrupJguBaa	No way! My husband cried like a little baby when our daughter was born. It's such a special moment. I would find it weird if he didn't cry! |`|uprGdkTsaa	Not immediately, as our son had to have a little help to breathe and we were so scared. They pressed an emergency alarm and all these people started piling in the room.    When they told us he was fine and passed him to me we both had teary eyes.

e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	No do not shave.  i aksed my doctor about this and he said that newly shaved skin has open pores which can allow for bacteria to get in.  If they need to shave you for any reason, they will do it and it will be more sterile.  i can only image what these doctors and nurses have seen!!  i wouldnt be worried, besides when you are in labor you wont care too much and modesty kinda goes out the window with most women :)|`|vue9NOhYaa	There is no need to shave yourself.    If you normally shave anyway, you can continue to do so (if you can reach and see what you're doing.)      Otherwise, don't give it another thought.  The doctor will manage just fine. (If hair does block his view, he'll clip it as needed.)     Doctors are used to everything. They see women with full Brazillian waxes, completely natural, and everything in between.|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Sweetie we don't care if your shaved or not we don't care.|`|7yHBkOczaa	i  wouldn't bother at all i felt thru my pregnancy i would be really embarrassed but at the time i didn't care at all |`|IGZHdvyqaa	I don't know how you could reach or see to do so at this point. They will be able to manage and if not they will take care of it for you. |`|NqQyFElCaa	As far as I know, it doesn't help at all. It might actually make it worse if you're not used to it, and end up with ingrown hairs and infections and stuff. Doctors and nurses have seen it all, so they don't care either way.  Besides, can you actually see and move around your belly enough to be able to shave? I sure can't! I barely even shave my legs anymore because it's just too much effort.|`|6df4a185c463cc37ea6503789eaa5390aa	It won't hurt.|`|5OGBneHLaa	No dont do it.

I suggest you shave your legs, but shaving "down there" is totally unneeded. I think the only time they would do that is IF (small chance) you would need a c section for some reason.     |`|57VejdOXaa	I don't think it really matters.  I don't think  I could have contorted enough to have been able to shave down there!

Good luck!|`|e2401928aa5cf1b88366444563d8609caa	If it makes YOU feel better, I say go for it. The truth about it is that the L&D nurses have seen almost everything there is to see when a woman is giving birth! lol You can stay just fine. They will be focusing on delivering your baby safely :)     I've heard it may cause infections sometimes cause the pores are open...so thats something to think about.|`|jdIABcBSaa	i agree that it doesn't matter.  i had a c-section and they wanted to shave me down there (but i already was).  if you NEED to be shaved, they'll let you know.  otherwise, you're fine!|`|qnTv7uq8aa	All my life I have been more comfortable shaved "down there"...so i continue to do so.

zEHU0E9Yaa	Never used the stuff, but just keep an eye on the sites. if they appear to be growing/spreading it could be a fungal/bacterial infection. Otherwise, if it is slowly disappearing then it's likely it's just a few dead cells that there's no capillary blood in anymore. If it's that then it's nothing to worry about and it will go away.

Le habrn confirmado este acontecimiento milagroso con un anlisis de sangre o un anlisis de orina en el hogar. Posiblemente se sienta feliz, sorprendida, aturdida, confundida, aliviada o viva todos esos sentimientos. Se ha iniciado en la maravillosa senda de ser madre.    Su beb: Si bien el embarazo (gestacion) (gestacion) se mide en semanas (7 dias)a partir de su ltimo perodo menstrual, lo ms probable es que el beb haya sido concebido hace 1 mes. Al beb en esta etapa (periodo de tiempo) de desarrollo se lo denomina embrin. Se parece ms a un renacuajo que a una persona y es muy peque?o (tiene un largo de menos de ? pulgada). El embrin tiene una cabeza, tronco y cola rizada. El tubo neural, que se convertir en el cerebro y espina dorsal del beb, se est cerrando y ya se ven las estructuras que se convertirn en los ojos, odos y corazn. La placenta, que es el rgano que nutrir al beb en los prximos nueve meses, tambin se est formando.    Su cuerpo: Es posible que usted sienta los primeros sntomas del embarazo (gestacion) (gestacion). Entre ellos se incluyen los siguientes:     Cansancio y fatiga   Nuseas, vmitos u otros malestares estomacales como acidez y gas   Dolor o sensibilidad en el pecho   Antojo o aversin a ciertos alimentos   Necesidad de orinar con frecuencia  Recuerde que no todas las mujeres sienten estas se?ales del embarazo (gestacion) (gestacion). Adems, cada embarazo (gestacion) (gestacion) es diferente y usted podr sentir o no los mismos sntomas de su embarazo (gestacion) (gestacion) anterior. Tambin es posible que tenga sntomas que jams sinti antes.    Lo que puede hacer: Cuide bien de s misma y del beb:     Tome multivitaminas o vitaminas prenatales ( antes del nacimiento) con cido flico todos los das.   Si no ha consultado ni elegido un profesional de la salud que la cuide durante el embarazo (gestacion) (gestacion), hgalo esta semana.   Deje de fumar, beber alcohol, tomar drogas ilegales o medicamentos no recetados. Si toma un medicamento recetado, pregunte al profesional de la salud si puede seguir tomndolo. Es posible que deba cambiar a otro medicamento o variar la dosis. Pero no deje de tomar el medicamento sin la aprobacin del mdico.   Si siente nuseas, pruebe a ingerir comidas peque?as durante el da, beba lquidos entre las comidas en lugar de hacerlo durante stas y lleve consigo galletas para calmar el estmago.    Semana 7 (edad (a?os de edad) del beb = 5 semanas)    Probablemente su mayor desafo sea sobrellevar los primeros sntomas del embarazo (gestacion) (gestacion). Aunque sus amigas, parientes y el profesional de la salud le digan que pronto pasar esta etapa, quizs le parezca que los das se alargan cuando siente nuseas.   Su beb: El beb est pasando por cambios que gradualmente lo harn verse ms como una persona. Se han formado los rganos y sistemas principales del cuerpo, pero stos no estn desarrollados an. El corazn est latiendo y el esqueleto est adquiriendo forma. El beb crecer ms del doble esta semana (7 dias) (aumentar de alrededor de ? pulgada a ? pulgada hacia fines de la semana).

6ccb483bdcbeec01ead0547481da3ba4aa	Maybe your test was a false positive.  Why don't you ask your doc?|`|eAphIHRHaa	I think you should wait a week or two and see a GI specialist or at least make a visit to the hospital if this continues.|`|Vv9Kpv5oaa	yea babies can hide...but how far do you think you are.... if you hadnt had period since august and where in november and lets say you conceived in september you should see the baby by now... sometimes the body can think its pregnant for a placenta get a positive test result but be no baby, i dont want to discourage you but if its been that long you should be 2-3 months pregnant and the baby should be visable.. wait till next ultrasound and i hope the baby is there.|`|BN1neFggaa	I've heard of something called  "phantom pregnancy"  It is where your body believes that is is pregnant, all of the symptoms of pregnancy present, even an enlarging belly with a fluid sac in the uterus... but No Baby.  Reasons for this could include stress or the belief that you are pregnant... your mind and mental state have such strong control of what your body does.  This happened to my cousin.  she had to take hormone pills to get her body back to where it was supposed to be...  Take care and God Bless... and NO MORE unprotected sex!!!|`|t3PXm1xYaa	Yeah it is possible, didnt they take blood tests?? They will test your hormone level now and then in a few days.. if it goes up youre pregos if it goes down you miscarried.    Sorry or Congrats whichever applies :)|`|sYsfI856aa	Well to tell the truth, it doesn't sound like you could have miscarried. Most of the time you will know. A lot of pain and very heavy bleeding with blood clots and tissues will be involved. I'm not sure what you situation is, it seems like it's possibly just a false positive result you got.     I would keep up with the doctors and tell them you want another Ultrasound in 2 weeks if you haven't had any other bleeding or signs.  Maybe a different technician.... I'm sorry to hear what's going on. I hope eventually it's figured out. Good luck.
H2IhRXIIaa	Urhg yes! Im now 29 weeks and it hasnt been happening as often but from 22 weeks till about 26 weeks I had it non stop it was so annoying.|`|UGGXqsasaa	Very normal.|`|klND8kCPaa	yes it is normal.
dtLi922Saa	EKG's are completely painless. Depending on what version of equipment they have, you'll be hooked up to a machine by wires stuck to your chest. Then all you have to do is lay still and relax. You honestly won't feel a thing. All they do is press a button, the test takes 60 seconds. The setting up takes about 5 minutes. Nothing to be worried about-- it's just checking the electrical activity of your heart. As for the physical, they're probably just going to weigh you, check your eyes, ears, throat, etc. And probably ask you a few questions.|`|ZAppRn5Faa	umm, a phyical is just like a normal doctors visit check up. they do your height,weight, look down your throat and in your ears and stuff like that, listen to your heart, and EKGs shouldnt hurtt.
kzt8Kdkfaa	Mine hated being on his stomach until he was able to roll over on his own...it seems like he was about 6 months old.  At that point he started doing everything on his stomach...sleeping, playing, hanging out, etc., and his flat spot went away pretty quickly.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	Put him on his side and roll up a blanket behind it.  How bad is it?  It has to be pretty bad to see a neurosurgeon, like bad enough to interfere with brain growth.  My sons head was misshapen at birth, got normal around 2 weeks the started getting flat on one side.  I just kept rotating what position he sleeps in and I hold him upright when I'm talking to him or playing. He's 10 weeks now and his head is fine.|`|SYBfPFcDaa	My baby got a really flat head at the back, and he's bald so it was very noticable! I bought this cushion thing for it, like a flat gel cushion with a dip in it where the head goes which is meant to prevent it, but by the time I bought it it was too late really! But he's only 9 months old now and it's got loads better since he's been crawling around and stuff, his skull is still a bit angular but it's getting noticably better now so hopefully your son will be the same!    Edit: Forgot to say, sorry no tips about keeping him off his back as my son was exactly the same! He screamed in tummy time and didn't care for anything else, but by 6 months he was crawling about of his own will, so just wait for your son to get the urge to be on the move and I'm sure it'll begin to improve then! :-)  Oh and, ????????'s name is very apt - makes me laugh when clueless people comment on questions in this section. Take no notice!|`|BNSu8Feaaa	my sister was in labor for many hours  of which her son was stuck in the birth canal. He was born with a cone shaped head, we are very grateful that they found this out and rushed her into have a c section. He had a cone shaped head for almost a year, by the time he could hold his head on his own was when it started to reform. Do as your doctor advises though, or change pediatricians. Wish him all the health.|`|gzoVU97Paa	firstly i dont have n e chldren but have raised many from birth and found that {and many people will say the same thing}when rounding  a baby's head u have to do that ..usually when they are first first born but its not too late but u have to really be determined to do it everyday.everyday just take your hands not to hard noot soft but enuf where u can fill it as if u r rolling a cookie in a ball..just rub the babys head and form it urself...if that doesn't work then try a doc but usually people who do so early on have great results...i wouldv'e been a conehead had my mmom not done so for me....just make sure u hold the baby upright and keep neck sturdy dont jerk neck or n e thing like that|`|vm8HtVUYaa	Hey, I also have a Landon! Landon James! =]  My Landon's head was flat until he started sleeping on his side (right around 6 months.) .. he had a flat back head for a long time.  My mom said (which I haven't tried) .. that if you take a warm wash cloth and rub their head (the entire head) gently in a circular motion it will help round their head.  I'm not sure if that works .. but it's worth a shot! =]    |`|GuRluYmraa	the baby in your profile pic is the cutest EVER!  im not to sure bout the reshaping thing, is it within the 1st year? i cant see how it could take longer
9hggEdf1aa	What you are doing is just right.  At 13 months babies really do not understand too much, But at that age they are starting to learn more directions.  In 6 montsh it will get better.  Never leave the kids alone, they can be rough and not realize it.  Good luck.

XKYP0sGQaa	Well, I have got a 15 year old little sister and if she told me that something bad had happened to her when she was younger and she did not want me to tell anyone, then I would respect that. I would want her to feel that she could continue to confide in me about any problems that she has/had. I would not want to risk losing her trust.     Although, I would encourage her to do what is right. Not pressurize her, but encourage. A 15 year old is old enough to make the ultimate decision/choice.    I am a 21 year old bloke but I know that if i told someone something in confidence and they went and passed that information on against my will I would find it very hard to trust them again. In-fact they would never fully regain my trust. Not fully.|`|OPzH4ih0aa	I don't know if there is anything I really could do except encourage the person to seek professional help.|`|ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	I would encourage them to get get counselling, that way they get help but without the other person knowing. Try to establish if they feel a need for 'justice' or if they just want to get on with their lives in which case counselling is a start|`|1coVkX3qaa	be there for them  they have built up the courage to tell you  this is the first step for them, be there, help them and let them know that what ever they decide you will be behind them one hundred percent  its tempting to pressure them into telling the athoritys but they are probably not ready yet  good luck and are hearts are with you |`|bruC8WUEaa	Do it slowly, show all the nasty terrible ways the person was bad to them, tell them theres no way on earth its their fault, and that if they dont tell any one it will haunt them for the rest of their lives, offer to go with them to tell someone, or offer to do it yourself.|`|gWwFzwOiaa	I would tell someone.  I know they might get mad at you for doing this but in reality it could help them.  |`|wCqjzUNraa	i would tell them to tell a authority and stop hassaling them |`|AA11657757	If it happened a long time ago, it's really hard to have a case against someone. Unless the sexual abuse was done by a close family member or something, your friend should speak up. I don't know if authorities can do anything about it, it depends on the situation, but that person could do the same thing to another person. If I were you, I would encourage your friend to seek therapy. Many women spend their whole lives living with an awful past and never getting over it.|`|0cNsF72daa	Imagine if someone hurt or killed someone you love. If you care about someone you want the best for them. Doing nothing to stop that persons pain and suffering is not loving them. In the long run your friend will thank you if you tell someone about the abuse.|`|nyNbdCLzaa	If they asked you to keep the secret, then you must. But I would do all you could to get them to speak out about it, to parents, police, etc etc. Support them, and go with them, if need be, and encourage them to face the past, so as the future will be free of the nightmares.    If you bury memories, bad memories, they will resurface and slowly destroy the life you are living.     xx|`|qVYwyrPSaa	Well first of all you have to consider the person. Although 15 is relatively young, he or she could quite easily command a very mature view of the world. If that is so then they will know what is the right thing and merely need some assuring and help.    If on the other hand that person is quite shy and reserved and perhaps is not as worldly then in that case i believe the best way forward is to above all take your time. Probably taken alot of time and courage to admit it to someone else. Going too fast will scare her away. I would just let them talk and see where it goes and gently lead them in the right direction , above all keep it a secret.  She was to take the steps, you have to help her take those steps    Ive started using her instead of her/him because im lazy |`|8vOPMannaa	i know this is hard but you need to tell somebody.|`|8iPtbwJXaa	i wouldnt tell,  this person has put so much trust into you and they will speak up when there ready.  you could maybe ask them what they would like you to do, i no you said they didnt want you to tell anyone, but maybe if they trust you that much give them the support they need tell them you'll help them as much as you can, maybe you could say you'll tell there mother for them, or be with them when they want to tell her!! but by you telling anyone without the persons permission could cause alot of problems for them like depression they could think of suicide anything. keep there secret as long as they need you to.|`|p0prrzf2aa	i would talk to them and tell them that THEY need to tell someone, someone needs to know that is so sad and pitiful :[ bless them|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If they were sexually abused and are a minor it would be your obligation to call the police and report the crime.   If they are an adult it's up to them.   And really, some folks should follow the desire of the victim in question.    Things like this do happen, it happened to my parents for example when I told them about my molestation.   I had 8 years to go forward and my folks chose to go with my desire not to prosecute.   Now we look back and sometimes wonder if it was the right thing to do, but we have watched the person in question who was 15 when he molested me - and I would have testified if he did the same thing again.   Of course my dad wanted to kill him...   And my boyfriend was the one who encouraged me to talk to my folks, which was the best thing I think - considering I was almost 18.  Now if I were 15 I think it would have been best for us to go forward...|`|9025b6ac4856e7655881c6f1c8293986aa	Your friend obviously told you, thinking they can trust you not to tell anyone.    Best thing you can do, is, try to get them to tell their parents.    Don't you go and do it.|`|I6CIURO3aa	wow iv been in that position before.  I kept her secret but i tried to encourage her to tell someone|`|AA10043485	15 year-olds can say some pretty shocking things, which are not always true.    Talking to the child or his/her parents would depend on a lot of variables, and can easily come back to haunt you.    Your best option here would be to tell Child Protective Services what you were told and let them handle it. They may not investigate immediately, but they have lots of experience and protect your identity.    |`|FcHplZtQaa	I've been in this situation, in the term that I was a 16yr old and I told someone I had been abused.  I wanted to have someone who was there for me, and I could talk to, at that point in my life that was what was important to me, unfortunately it didn't work out like that and everything got fecked up!    If I was you i'd be there for whoevers spoken to you, it might not be what YOU feel is right, but it's whats right for whoevers confided in you!|`|AA11760898	why did it happen to you?|`|HXfHkoSHaa	For the health of the youngster, I'd tell one of the parents.  That is, if they are competent parents.  A child that endures abuse needs therapy.  Even if they think they're fine.      I'd tell the friend I was going to tell if they didn't.  Possibly ruining a friendship is sometimes part of the cost of being a good friend.|`|kmAiMRtnaa	It's a difficult one.  I'd start by encouraging them to tell the relevant authorities or their parents or asking if they'd like me to tell them on their behalf.  I'd explain to them what might happen if people were told.    If the abuse has now stopped and there's no chance of it starting again, and they don't want anyone else to know, then I may leave it at that.  However, if it's still going on, you have a duty of care to tell someone.  I can understand how the 15 year old feels, but as a parent I would want to know so that I can be supportive and help.  But it depends what sort of relationship they have with their parents.|`|IXqCB5oqaa	I understand that this child confided in you to keep it a secret but you also have to consider the fact that this is just a child, and the reasons a 15 year old might have for keeping it a secret in the first place, such as being worried that adults will be angry about it or that it's just too embarrassing. What I would do in a situation like that is absolutely tell the authorities, not to mention who ever has done this to the child should be punished for it, and how do you know the predator is not doing this to other children. It has to be hard to be in a situation like that, I was sexually abused as a child but too embarrassed to tell anyone and not only did it continue but it even went on to other children, I wish now that not only had I said something sooner but that anyone could have stepped in and handled it, I didn't know I could do anything which is why it went on. Good luck, I hope you make the right decision.

I also have very irreg periods. Around christmas I realized I had gaining some  weight, went from a size 10 to a tight 14 I thought it was holiday lbs. On new years eve after a few drinks my fiance's mom asked when the baby was due. My fiance had thought I might be pregnant but I did not believe it since I didnt have morning sickness and my last period had been february. Luckily his aunt is a radiologist and the next day she did a sonogram. Sure enough I was 6 months pregnant. I was shocked. Your symptoms definately sound like pregnancy. I had the brown line running down my belly from about 6.5 months on, I started to feel movement at around 5 mos but I thought it was gas, I also had an increase in discharge which is normal in pregnancy. When you went to the dr your hcg levels may not have been high enough. I would recommend getting a blood test to be sure. I would do it as soon as possible. I was scared from the time I found out I was pregnant until I gave birth that there would be something wrong with my baby because I went so long without prenatal care. Luckily he was born perfect. Good luck!

ydYi0lu2aa	If it's really what she wants and you have no problem with it I say go for it! I mean it would probably look really cute too!

Its so trashy... she's only 10, come on!|`|pMm3sLekaa	I don't think you should, it does look a little rebellious. Try and reason with her. If she's too stubborn or you're too weak enough to refuse then make a deal with her tell her she can get her ears pierced. If she already has them pierced tell her she can have her second holes.<br>  <br>  My mother wouldn't let me or my brother pierce anything only because she was too scared (Though I want my tongue pierced, so I can understand where she's coming from) because when it's getting pierced it could hit a nerve in her eyebrow and she could become paralyzed. Or that's what my mother would tell me. I'm not a hundred percent sure but why not tell her she needs to be older? I'm sure she'll have a fit and whine because she probably wants it because her friends have it or gave her the idea but, in my opinion, it would be better to wait until she's in high school.|`|NMjM2X4taa	NO WAY. she is much to young for this. I almost suspect this is one, a trolls question, or two, a very ignorant mother.|`|vR6AwIppaa	sure. get the eyebrow, nose, ears, and hey! why not a tongue?<br>  <br>  yeah that totally won't make her look trashy at all.|`|de3585a639a519d1686e00acd0c94d58aa	She's 10.She should only have piercings on her ears.Just 1 on her ears.|`|AA11310070	No.  Tell her she can get one in a couple years, but until then, no.

You should suggest getting nipple piercings to match her eyebrow piercing! Its totally painless and very, nice!|`|gRPNgRbdaa	Why would she want to?

What are you thinking.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Wow, if you did that where I live, you can bet someone would call CPS and they would investigate.  But, I say "No."|`|EccBqsntaa	Yeah. And then she can go get her nipples pierced! And then she can get a boob job!!<br>  <br>  Are you crazy? No!|`|vLJKNkNLaa	heck no!|`|6gthdHpnaa	No. At 10 she's not mature enough to make decisions she won't regret later...and she will regret this piercing. So have her wait at least until she's 18 and capable of learning more about this piercing and the dangers, stereotypes, etc. associated with it.|`|0Kw2yVp4aa	i dont think so. i mean if u start when shes 10 by the time shes 16 shell want everything pierced and more. i think u should tell her to wait till she becomes a woman (getting her period) or tills shes 16 or w.e age u and ur spouse thing is a good age.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Its trashy. Especially for a 10 year old. I don't understand why you don't  see any problems with her wanting one! She is 10! I nice ear piercing is okay but not eyebrow!|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Of course not!<br>  You need to read the book<br>  "parenting for dummies".<br>  it will help you make the right decisions.<br>  <br>  You can find it at Amazon.com|`|9LTWa08Laa	gross no<br>  she's still not done growing<br>  when shes older it's going to become stretched and scar really bad.<br>  what's wrong with you...|`|COEMM8eVaa	The final choice is yours, but I wouldn't think so.|`|3MVv1uOaaa	I think ten years old is way too young for any piercings but single ear piercings

If you want that extra REASSURANCE, get a home pregancy kit just so you can see the blue line not appear.    Sperm can survive outside of the body up to an hour unless it is all dried up.    If you are going to start having sex, make sure you purchase condoms with spermercide and ..if you want the extra safer route to not get pregant, get on the pill.    But the pill won't prevent you from getting any STD.     Be smart when you engage yourself in such intimate matters. You never know what your partner has and don't have. Only trust yourself and your instinct. |`|6L9jJnchaa	Get on birth control before you do ANY kind of fooling around.  No, you're not pregnant.|`|5Xx8Cumjaa	Highly HIGHLY doubtful.

Have you ever heard of artificial insemination? In order for you to get pregnant without actually having sex, a doctor must place sperm, which is fresh from the spouse or frozen from a donor, inside a huge syringe which is very long in order to inseminate you. So, just by doing what you did ...you are not pregnant. But if you are sexually active and don't want a kid...you need to use protection or take birth control. It would save you a lot of worry. Good Luck. I hope I helped.|`|AA10774852	The odds are infinitesimal.  They are not zero.

533cbd5eb0dd99b30a5f8427d0b02ac8aa	It hit me when I was 27.  We had two kids by time I turned 30.  I couldn't explain it, but just needed to start having kids.  Luckily, my husband was okay with it!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	This is totally normal and natural - it's your maternal instinct and hormones messing with you! What I did was find some work with children, volunteering, so I was around them, doing things with and for them. If you especially like babies, some hospitals have volunteer programs for women to come in and hold/feed/rock babies. Fill your life with family, friends, and fun. I didn't get married til 28 and had first baby at 30! These days, it's not much of  a problem if it's even later...|`|AA11958479	I had that feeling in my later twenties. I have been wanting a baby and seeing children and wondering if i will ever have one. If I would ever find the right man. But now I am almost thirty and think I have. I am about 10 weeks along now. I am a little scared this is my first one.|`|5590e67e0fe2a28d3cdc02bb1886e156aa	I did the same thing; I swore for years I didn't want children because I come from a big family, but by my late twenties, I was married for five years and desperately wanted a child.  I had my daughter at thirty, and she keeps me young.    For me it was just a desire for a fulfilment; a need to have a child to nuture, and a completion of the love of my husband and myself.  I do feel that a child needs two parents if at all possible, and a person needs all the help they can get in raising a child.  You don't know how much work it is until you have one, and how you sublimate yourself to this little person until they can take care of their own basic needs for a little while.  I wouldn't give up my daughter for anything; she means the world to me.

85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	Les bbs qui pleurent sont une source d'inquitude pour beaucoup de parents. Quand votre bb pleure et que vous ne savez pas pourquoi, cela peut veiller en vous des sentiments d'anxit, d'impuissance, de frustration, d'incomptence et mme de colre et d'hostilit. Il existe beaucoup de conseils  propos des bbs qui pleurent, mais la plupart ne savent pas expliquer les raisons relles des pleurs, et font des suggestions qui nuisent au dveloppement motionnel de votre bb.    Les bbs pleurent pour deux raisons profondes. D'une part, ils essaient de communiquer un besoin ou une gne. Ils peuvent avoir faim, s'ennuyer, avoir froid ou bien ils ont simplement besoin d'tre tenus. Quelquefois, il est difficile de saisir de quoi ils ont besoin. Le r?le des parents ou des soignants est d'essayer de combler les besoins du bb aussi rapidement et prcisment que possible. Les bbs ne peuvent pas tre "gats". Il est impossible de leur donner trop d'amour, d'attention et de contact physique.    La seconde raison des pleurs durant l'enfance est moins bien comprise. Beaucoup de bbs continuent  pleurer quand tous leurs besoins fondamentaux ont t combls, et alors mme qu'ils sont tenus. Ce genre de pleurs, qui culmine aux alentours de six semaines, a t nomm "colique." Cela peut durer plusieurs heures par jour. L'explication traditionnelle pour ces pleurs a t centre sur d'ventuels problmes physiques tels que des gaz ou des troubles digestifs. Cependant, des recherches ont montr que la plupart des bbs qui ont la "colique" ne prsentent rien au niveau de leur digestion, et sont la plupart du temps en excellente sant. Il est donc ncessaire de prendre en considration de possibles raisons motionnelles qui provoquent les pleurs.

Un prnom, amusant et mignon dans les premires annes de bb, pourrait, plus tard, ne pas faire le mme effet sur le CV de votre enfant.    Prnoms mixtes    Prfrez-vous un prnom masculin ou fminin uniquement, ou mixte (le choix d'un prnom mixte peut tre utile quand vous ne connaissez pas le sexe de l'enfant) ?

Le pige des prnoms communs    Les prnoms trs rpandus ou  la mode peuvent tre une bndiction ou un flau. D'un c?t biens?r, vous ne pouvez pas vous tromper avec un tel prnom. Mais d'un autre c?t, votre fils ou votre fille sera probablement connu comme Isabelle P. ou Stphane O.  l'cole et durant toute sa vie.    Analyser le prnom avec les yeux d'un enfant de 12 ans    Nous sommes tous passs par l - nos camarades de classes essaient toujours de nous trouver un surnom " ridicule ". Votre enfant vous remerciera s?rement d'avoir vit les prnoms qui peuvent tre sujets, trop facilement, aux taquineries et moqueries en tout genre. Prnommer votre fille " Prune " pourra la mettre mal  l'aise  un moment de sa vie.    Prendre en compte le nom de famille    En recherchant un prnom, il convient de prendre en considration le nom de famille du bb. Le prnom et le nom rassembls doivent donner une jolie consonance. On peut par exemple rpter le nom entier  voix haute  plusieurs reprises pour se faire une ide.    Nom de bb et initiales    En choisissant le prnom de bb, fa?tes attention aux initiales qu'il compose avec le nom de famille et qui peuvent tre plus ou moins embarrassantes.

49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	Sounds like separation anxiety.     At certain stages, most babies or toddlers will show true anxiety and be upset at the prospect  or reality  of being separated from a parent. If you think about separation anxiety in evolutionary terms, it makes sense: A defenseless baby would naturally get upset at being separated from the person who protects and cares for him.    In many ways, attitudes about babies and separations are cultural. Western countries tend to stress autonomy from a very early age. But in many other cultures, infants are rarely separated from their mother in the first year of life.    Regardless of the origins of this normal developmental stage, it's frustrating for babies and parents. The good news is that separation anxiety will pass and there are ways to make it more manageable. And in the meantime, enjoy the sweetness of knowing that to your child, you're number one.  When does it most commonly occur?    Babies can show signs of separation anxiety as early as 6 or 7 months, but the crisis age for most babies is between 12 to 18 months. Most commonly, separation anxiety strikes when you or your spouse leaves your child to go to work or run an errand. Babies can also experience separation anxiety at night, safely tucked in their cribs with Mom and Dad in the next room.    How should we handle nighttime separation anxiety?    Your baby's fear of being separated from you at night is very real for him, so you'll want to do your best to keep the hours preceding bedtime as nurturing and peaceful (and fun) as possible. In addition:    ?  Spend some extra cuddle time with your baby before bed by reading, snuggling, and softly singing together.    ?  If your baby cries for you after you've put him to bed, it's fine to go to him  both to reassure him and to reassure yourself that he's okay. But make your visits "brief and boring," and he'll learn to fall back to sleep without a lot of help from you. Eventually, he'll be able to fall asleep on his own.    *****go to the following website to read more about it.  http://www.babycenter.com/0_separation-a...|`|sEqc7oaxaa	Have you tried to turn on some soft music or maybe make a ritual before bedtime like a bath and then putting her in a sleeper or pajamas? It worked for my little one. Sometimes the baby just needs a little more comfort when going to sleep. I know it may sound like she is too old for it but sometimes swaddling her in a blanket will give her that close security that she is wanting. Hope this helps and goodluck.|`|eFVfwWkBaa	id love to say "ok do this.." unfornately i cant if she was screaming id say it was what my mom inlaw calls night terrors but if she just crying then its an easy answer(for me anyway) theres most likelly nothing wrong..all babies go thru this at different ages im going thru it with my 6 month old now. for some reason they just dont want to go to bed when you want u no. i wish i could give you an easy fix but i cant its just a phase and it will pass i promise!you just have to use that one talent that is imbedded in you when the're born its called patience!! im sorry i couldnt give you quick fix other than that the only thing i can say to try is to make sure she is good and asleeo b4 you out her down and even then theres no guarantee that itll work! good luck!|`|HqtdnJvqaa	my 9 month old son was doing the same thing. i figured out it was because his top two teeth are coming in. maybe you could check her gums and make sure there is nothing bothering her. good luck : )

ADD: I don't imagine they will do the trick. A weight will only give him the joy of back pain/stress. It won't let him feel ligament pain when he stands up or rolls over or sneezes. It won't give him sciatica. It won't duplicate the feeling of being kicked in the bladder or having something wedged up under his ribs. It won't jam his intestines into a small knot and give him acid reflux. In short, it won't do much. I would worry that he would wear it and be unimpressed.|`|PjPpdWJyaa	It depends on the class, some of them do and some of them don't, but you can buy them.

It doesn't matter how long it's been.  Take it!!! :)|`|AWuJMXQEaa	It means you can test as early as the first day of a missed period.  Your first morning urine will contain the strongest HCG content if you are pregnant.  Just about all test are the same.  Just remember there are no false positives, but you can have a false negative.  You also may not be pregnant.  Stress from a new marriage, wedding, etc. can cause a missed or late period.  Hope you get what you want!|`|NZtxgUgAaa	Yes it will work...All it means is to take the test from the first day of your missed period and any day after that for more accurate results....It will work just fine ....Good Luck!|`|KiO0xohtaa	Oh it should still work. I had good luck with Clear Blue easy Digital, but I am asuming any test would work. Good luck!|`|f9da5d728885a97b52fd1a71e4e5ad4faa	If you have missed a period, you can use urine from any time of day.  I suggest using a pregnancy test that puts a plus sign or a negative sign for your results.  If you use on that has a line come up if its positive or negative, you could misread it.  I hated that when I would take a test and there would be a faint line.  I would then have to go buy another test with the more reliable results.  Sometimes when a woman is under stress you can miss your period, so just to be on the safe side, take the test and put your mind at ease.  It never failed, whenever I put off taking a test, my period would not come b/c I was super stressed, but let me go out and buy a test, take the test come up negative, that night when I would go to bed I would get my period.   Drove me crazy.  Anyway, its a good idea to know as soon as possible if you are pregnant, then you can start your folic acid multivitamins, and keep away from harmful activities while preggers, ie.., cat litter do not change it if you are preggers, dangerous, really not kidding.    Hope this long winded answer helped.  :)
ru6PshZ4aa	That is sooooo normal,dont stress. My angel cried also on her tummy as she got tired,but as her muscles got stronger she was fine ( 5.5 months) now she rolls to her tum but not back the other way yet. It is completely normal,they are like adults..all different.

He is fine.  My son cries too because he hates being on his tummy, but that makes his tummy muscles strong.  So if he cries, then maybe do it 4 or 5 times a day, but for about 5 - 10 minutes.  I put him on his tummy and get on my back and talk to him, that way he lifts his head to coo and smile at me.|`|9cd9383a997bf65ebbab2109e8128616aa	If it makes you feel any better, my cousin's son is 6 months and he wont roll over yet.  belly to back or back to belly.

Don't force anything.  Put him on his belly for about 10-15 minutes several times a day.  He will figure it all out.|`|Cu1WIkSEaa	This is perfectly normal for a baby at the age of 14 years old. Every child is different than others and some don't develop quick enough as other babies. Some might even take 1-2 years to start learning how to stand. But the maximum it can usually take for a baby to start learning how to crawl is 20-30 weeks. So don't worry if your child is not learning quick enough to what is should be doing now a days. Perfectly normal and should take time, Be a patient mother =)|`|GZb5gNs1aa	Babies NEVER roll over that early!  Dont worry, it will be weeks or even a few MONTHS before he does.  If he has a sensitive tummy and gas problems, it may even be causing him PAIN to be on his tummy.  My daughter was like that for months.  She literally couldnt tolerate being on her tummy because it hurt.  Her doctor says its just something that happens with some babies.  I have LOTS of neices and nephews and friends with kids, as well as a child of my own.  The EARLIEST I have ever heard of a child rolling all the way over is 5 or 6 months.  If you have any real concerns, its best to talk to your childs pediatrician.  I know its hard, but quit trying to grow your baby up so fast.  Let them enjoy the different stages of development.  You dont want to push your child on to the next level all the time, or you will make them feel like you dont think they are good enough and dont like them for who they are.  Encourage and teach, but dont freak.

See a doctor if it continues or has an odor.|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	i am having the same cm, except mine is yellowish and slighty wet, i have no std's or infections and i am also past ovulation. i have read that cm after ovulation could be a pregnancy sign but not always. my temps are also staying up, but thats normal as they usually drop right before your period. id say wait it out and see if you actually miss your period.  good luck-

GGLesOtMaa	Hola! No se si sera lo mejor o no pero en mi caso fue exactamente asi. Me faltaban 26 dias para hacer los 35. Cuando tenia menos a?os preferi terminar mis estudios y buscar un trabajo, luego conoci a mi marido y decidimos ahorrar para comprarnos una casa y poder casarnos. Y cuando ya pensabamos que estabamos un poco establecidos y con cierta seguridad laboral fuimos a buscar el bebe. Asi que ya ves entre una cosa y otra me puse en los 34. Para mi ha sido una edad perfecta para ello , te explico. En cuanto que tienes hijos la vida te cambia, ya no sales como antes a cenar y al cine ni planeas viajes largos, casi ni cortos porque la primera vez que nos fuimos a la playa con mi hija que ya tenia un a?o se nos puso con 40 de fiebre y nos pasamos las vacaciones casi sin salir del hotel. Yo ya habia podido disfutar de todas estas cosas antes de ser madre y por eso se que aunque de vez en cuando las extra?e por lo menos ya las he vivido. Ahora estoy centrada en la crianza de mi hija y dedico a ella todas mis fuerzas. Creo sinceramente que si hubiera sido madre mas joven, no habria podido darle la seguridad que ahora tiene, en cuanto a economia, ni yo habria podido disfrutar de muchas de las cosas que vivi. Si que es verdad que mi paciencia ya no es la misma que cuando tenia 20 a?os pero la sonrisa de felicidad de mi hija me da mucha cuando parece que se me termina. Bueno como ves, para esto hay muchas opiniones y todas son igual de buenas. Lo que esta claro es que con los adelantos que en materia medica tenemos hoy en dia, nos podemos permitir planificar cuando y como queremos ser madres y que nuestros hijos nacen igual de sanos con 20 que con 35, para eso estan muchas de las pruebas que te haces durante el embarazo. Asi que ahora tu decides el orden de prioridades de tu vida. Te deseo todo lo mejor!|`|LerXvyOEaa	En absoluto, es una buena edad, por que sabes lo que quieres, ya te has labrado un futuro, tienes profesin, y ya te has divertido, llega el momento de ser mam de verdad.  Esos estudios que dicen que hay que ser mam durante la veintena esta obsoletos, se considera los treinta y cinco como buena edad.    Que ests bien.    Chao.|`|u95VALmNaa	Hola, yo al contrario escuche que apratir de los 30 a?os la mujer corre riesgos ya que cada vez su cuerpo se deteriora mas, una de mis tias tuvo a su primer hija  a los 32 y le fue todo bien y mi otra tia esta por tener su primer bebe y tiene 34 pero el doctor le dijo que si quiere tener otro que no lo piese mucho ya que dsp de los 35 a?os es muy arriesgado quedar embarazada.    besotes!|`|vttN42dkaa	Mentiras, la mejor edad para una mujer es de 25 a los 30 a?os, a los 35 a?os ya es muy riesgoso para la mujer.    Donde escuchaste eso, casi todos los estudios dicen que a esa edad es bastante riesgoso, no digamos a los 40.|`|db525cb31ca68f3345d586d073f04c5daa	Ya con 29 tu mente y cuerpo esta bien preparado para er madre; si creo que a los 35 es un poquito tarde.

Lo conveniente es que sea antes de esa edad y el ultimo lo puedes tener a esa edad.|`|RuCggxg9aa	Mira la decision para ser madre la tomamos nosotras como mujeres si tu decision es esperar hazlo! definitivamente es tardia tal vez ya no tengas los mismos animos para cuidar a un bebe ademas tu metabolismo estara mas lento y tu organismo mas delicado pero aqui quien tiene la ultima palabra eres tu, felicidades adelantadas un bebe es una bendicion.|`|4e0MQl14aa	yo opino qyue no. si bien, ya vivio su vida, entons no tendra oportunidad de ver a sus hijos crecer. eso sin contar que muchas mujeres a esa edad se empizan a desmotivar y su cuerpo no es el mismo. yo pino que a los 29-30 estaria bien|`|10b7a814126a33fa71942d985bc26274aa	HOLA Q TAL     TENGO 33 A?OS Y PARA SERIA LA MEJOR EDAD PA TENER UN BB YA Q YO NO LOS HE TENIDO IMAGINATE!!!!!!!!

Solo te puedo decir que una amiga tuvo su embarazo a los 34 a?os, recien tuvo la nena hace 2 meses, y estan ambas muy saludables, solo que no la paso muy bien los primeros tres meses con hemorragias y eso. Los medicos le dijeron que era normal al ser primeriza y tan mayor para estar embarazada, pero que al tener esa edad corria cierto riesgos de perdida. No se, depende de vos, yo la verdad que creo que cuanto antes quedes embarazada mejor, pero es tu decision. Saludos!!!|`|d4d03bd4a755e2a73b5dc80dd8d263e1aa	mientras mas a?os tengas mas dificil se te va a hacer consevir un hijo, despues de los 35 el numero de tus obulos q pueden ser fecundados es cada ves menor... no se que tan sierto sea lo de lo cientificos, pero no era lo que yo sabia..  saludos!|`|4B6CD4lWaa	eres mama cuando te toca no cuando tu quieras, mira yo queria tener mi bebe a los 28 a?os y ahora que tengo 26 soy mama de una hermosa bebe de 6 meses y no estaba en mis planes y aqui lo comprobe eres mama cuando te toca!!! suerte.|`|2381627573167400fa316dbb4e53b1beaa	lo que haces esta bien ya que no hay ningun problema que puedas tener  pero si ya puedes tener a tu hijo o familia es mejor que ya lo tengas y no esperar tener los 34 a?os aunque aparenta no tener problemas mejor , es tener menos a?os, porque realmente  YA L SALES DE ESO .|`|qtwW8JJoaa	Yo dira que estas en una buena edad, tanto fsica como mentalmente, adems yo sabia que despus de los 30 hay mas probabilidades de que el bebe nazca con alguna discapacidad y tambin la madre corre mas riesgo que si se embaraza de los 20-30.  Mejor investiga un poco mas no te fes en ese tipo de estudios que ma?ana sacan otro y te dicen que siempre no.  Si tu quieres un bebe ahora, adelante es tu decisin.|`|2wDJmluOaa	segun todo lo que he escuchado la mejor edad es alrededor de los treinta, digamos entre 27 y 31 pues tienes madurez fisica y mental para esto  de manera personal te digo que no debes esperar para hacer cosas, nadie tenemos la vida o el tiempo comprado asi que si deseas hacer algo y tienes la oportunidad de realizarlo, no veo la razon de esperar pues tal vez cuando llegue esa edad por alguna razon no puedas hacerlo, disfrutemos la vida como se va presentando no crees?|`|1JqJKzyzaa	Creo que es una buena edad para ser madre primeriza a los 34 horas siempre y cuando tu salud sea buena. Lo debes de decidir  tu y tu  pareja, tu edad es muy buena para ser madre ya pero si tu quieres, esta es una eleccin personal y no importa la opinin de nadie mas, SOLAMENTE LO QUE TU PIENSES. Sino haz decidido nada preparate  emocionalmente, profesionalmente, y por supuesto economicamente para recibir mas adelante a tu bebe con lo mejor de lo mejor.

FGZR9RwDaa	hangout with your friend when she's with the guys she hangs out with.. you never know they probably would like you!
ToIsKLKYaa	That frustrated me, too!  "He" has had NO operation to remove or alter his female reproductive organs.  The only thing making him a "man" would be the male hormones he takes in order to grow facial hair, and I believe he stopped taking them before and during the pregnancy in order to procreate.  I don't understand the media hype.  "He" is technically no more than a cross-dresser.    People would argue that transgendered people are whichever gender they most identify with, regardless of their physical attributes, which I can accept as an argument normally.  However, in this case, where the hype is all about a MAN being PREGNANT, the emphasis is on the fact that a man is not physically able to bear children.  If, in the future, a true male human were able to carry and bear a child (not likely, but for the sake of argument...), his story would be cheapened by this one.    |`|3zwo0PWNaa	She is a wo/man!|`|KnTrvQd6aa	"With a uterus, he isn't a man"...so presumably then, without a uterus, one isn't a woman?      Gender is not determined by genitalia; it's determined by the microstructure of the brain. gender is established before birth, it's unchangeable, and it's not dependent on genitalia or chromosomes.    Mr Beattie is a man; a transsexual man. he was born with female anatomy, but that doesn't make him a woman, any more than being born with a tail makes you a monkey.    He is not the first transsexual man to give birth, and he probably won't be the last.    Here's a brief introduction to what transsexualsim actually is (rather than what the media would have you believe it is);  http://www.alterheros.com/english/dossie...  |`|yDfbQOTjaa	no, they dont get rid of their organs. everybody can be whatever they say they want to be! yay what a crazy world!|`|GjuRYsITaa	SHE IS A WOMAN   she may look like a man but SHE still has her bits and i think SHE IS ripping every 1 off|`|G3HZWdZ7aa	you should read this. it helped me understand heaps      Thomas Beatie, also known as The Pregnant Man, has given birth to a girl, he confirms to PEOPLE exclusively.     Beatie, 34, who began life as a woman and legally switched to a male identity, while preserving his female reproductive organs, and his wife Nancy, 46, welcomed a daughter at an Oregon hospital on June 29. Both Beatie and his daughter are healthy and doing well, he tells PEOPLE.     Beatie, who took twice-weekly doses of testosterone and had his breasts surgically removed during his female-to-male transition, made headlines around the globe last April when he announced in an exclusive interview in PEOPLE and on The Oprah Winfrey Show that he was expecting a child  while legally living as a man.     Raised in Hawaii, he spent the first two decades of his life as Tracy Lagondino, a Girl Scout, former model and finalist in a Miss Hawaii Teen USA pageant. Beatie told PEOPLE that he began to dress and live as a man in his 20s, in time officially changing his gender on his passport and driver's license.     In 2003, he legally married Nancy, a divorced mother of two who had had a hysterectomy as a result of endometriosis.     The couple became pregnant using donor sperm and Thomas's eggs, through artificial insemination, after relocating in 2005 to Bend, Ore., where they operate a T-shirting printing business.     Their baby girl is Thomas's first child. "The only thing different about me is that I can't breastfeed my baby. But a lot of mothers don't," he told PEOPLE.     Despite published reports, Beatie says the baby was not delivered via C-section. He intends to publish a book about his experience this fall. |`|AA10916164	HE is still technically a SHE... has the uterus ( and possibly Ovaries and Fallopian tubes )   All the parts needed to make a baby.

It takes all kinds to make up this world.  |`|mZi7R0Enaa	he was born a female, actually won a beauty contest in HI but decided to have his breasts removed and be injected with testosterone.

wBpennsMaa	If you are a few days into your 36th week of pregnancy its normal to want to be induced and wanting to have your baby here. Not selfish at all! You want to love your baby! Medical technology has come so far over time and by that time your baby is healthy and stands a chance as does any other full term baby and you are even to a point where the placenta has started to diminish in use. Its a good idea to get your baby out. Labor can last up to 24 hours so if you want your boyfriend to be able to spend time with your son put that into play. Either ask for an induction or ask for a C Section that way you can schedule the time and everything. Its very convenient. I don't know what kind of pain you are in as I didn't dilate at all and I had a C Section at 38 weeks and 6 days but I would be upset if I had to be pregnant that long! I know how uncomfortable it is! Congrats & Good luck! What you are about to experience is the most amazing thing in the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: As I said I had a C Section and breastfeeding is going wonderfully for me!|`|PLbmKNpvaa	It's not selfish, it's normal!<br>  I'd say wait though, apparently labour via induction is a lot more strenuous and painful because your body is trying to do more in a shorter period of time and you don't have the chance to get used to the pain. You might not think it's worth it when you do it!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Getting induced isn't selfish, especially if you are at your due date. My friend got induced Dec 19th cuz she didn't want to end up being in labor or in the hospital for xmas. Do what is best. As long as your not only 37 weeks or something its no big deal. Being at your due date is perfectly fine.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	If you are due saturday I do not see a problem with it.  If you were 36 or 37 weeks I would think you were nuts but your full term.  Good luck hun|`|VFifg9FEaa	Yes it is selfish.  I believe that unless there is a life threatening medical reason let the baby develop as long as it needs to.  It will come when it is ready.<br>  <br>  After you have the baby all your uncomfortableness will be a faint memory.  <br>  <br>  Let the baby come when he wants to come.  Go with his schedule not your or you BF's work schedule.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	my dr said my baby is big i was 9  days late for my daughter so i asked how he felt about inducing me right at 40 weeks he said it was up to me but when you get induced the chances of having a c -section are greater so i said ok forget it i will let him come when he is ready !!|`|drOXfPM6aa	The baby will come when it is ready. Those due dates can be off by two weeks or so. Yes, it does sound selfish. <br>  <br>  <br>  I am 36 weeks 6 days pregnant and I am 2cm, have lost my mucus plug, 100% effaced, and softened.|`|zBz10IiOaa	you are not selfish hun i would think he will go ahead and do it it is only one day,i know how you feel i was there last febuary and i had to get induced but you are by far selfish|`|3EiOobEVaa	i don't think that it is selfish...i am not as far along as you so i don't know exactly what you are going through...but being uncomfortable is enough to ask to be induced...Good Luck|`|nQyJFOMZaa	I was 5cm dilated for 3 weeks!! Usually if you tell the Dr you are very uncomfortable and you are due they wont have a problem with inducing you.|`|HTTCHvxgaa	I was induced 2 days early because I was miserable, I was so thankful but it did result in a c-section. Sometimes your body just isn't ready.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Unless the doctor ok's it it's not gonna happen, so don't get your hopes up too high.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I don't care what ya do.|`|uedxuihBaa	Yes, selfish. Babies do better when they decide on their own. Like a ripe fruit.. they drop when ready.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I'd only consider it selfish  if you wanted them born on a certain day for other reasons (like you want tp to pick their birthday)... you're uncomfortable...that's not selfish.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	On the one hand it can result in more complications which can toy with your breastfeeding experience.  Let's say worst cast scenario you end up with a c-sec and it is too difficult to deal the pain  your own incision and pain of getting used to nursing.  I wouldn't advise it.  <br>  <br>  OTOH, I was really lucky that my babies were born on the weekend or near the weekend so my husband never had to take off work.  I wouldn't hold it against <br>  you.  <br>  <br>  But this is probably the first of MANY MANY MANY instances where your comfort and convenience  are going to take a backseat to your babies.  This is a royal pain in the butt, but you know what, it is just the beginning of the sacrifice.
dmqVzSZKaa	it's just a dream...|`|ILw3Rw3Jaa	omg same kinda thing happend to me, and i didnt do my hw and that teacher shouted at me and i remembered the dream and i felt like crying lol it was so scary|`|qFDcKWlbaa	at least it wasn't one of those orgasmic dreams ...that would be weird..lol|`|U9H6484iaa	OMG. I would be so freaked out, I know how you feel.
agfiNdLraa	By having sex the 28th and 29th you are hitting it on the days leading up to ovulation so thats very good!. Get your hubby into bed tonight and the next day!  But no your on a good path girl! GOOD LUCK!!! And check your cervical mucus and when its stretchy egg white discharge then your ovulating!!!! good luck and i hope you get pregnant really soon!! baby dust to you!!!! Im probably going to get thumbs down for saying this..but EVERYONE WHO ANSWERED THIS QUESTION is an idiot.... dont write WHAT?? or her question doesnt make sense. YOUR question DOES make sense. YOu just have idiots answering it hahah! good luck girly!|`|kV9YT6bSaa	what??|`|b67de083bd7c9f1568273a84784dcdfbaa	OK...ur either super excited abt really being pregnant or ur sick of all the repeated "am i pregnant" questions!!  Either way....kudos!!|`|o1yy6KABaa	Sorry yoru question reallt doesnt make any sense, I think you were meaning baby dance not baby dust...  anyhow, your most fertile days are 10-14 days from the day your period starts, so make the most of that time, and also check for egg white coloured cervical mucas to indicate ovulation. No harm doing BD on the other days either to increase your chances|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	huh?|`|RrPjG9x9aa	might as well, just to be on the safe side.  and for future reference, I started using an ovulation predictor kit this month and it takes all the guess work out of it!  I BD on the two days I got the positive opk, plus the 2 days after, and because I had gotten a positive telling me I had a definite LH surge, I knew that I had timed it right (now I'm in the 2ww).  If this doesn't end up being "the month", definitely look into opk's, I highly recommend them.  They can get expensive in stores (7 tests in a box for between $12 and $20), but I got 50 on ebay for $14.99......can't beat that:)|`|X40Ww89qaa	if you are pregnant, don't dance!|`|pW3G1onIaa	IF YOU FEEL LIKE BD GO AHEAD WHY NOT ITS FUN ANYWAYS|`|drzN1kkuaa	what?
6igjX2cnaa	hun I'm right there with you in the 2ww, but I'm only 5 dpo.  I gotta tell you, ever since 3 dpo i've had cramping too.  I think it may be from my ovidrel shot I took to trigger ovulation, but none the less, never felt cramps that early before!  I've also had sore breasts ever since ovulation but I think that's the trigger also.  Good luck to you hun! I hope we both get some good news next week!! :)  ~Baby Dust~|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I think its way too early to tell and you are reading way too much into it. Try to keep your mind off of it instead of thinking every thing is a symptom. You probably want to be pregnant so bad your mind and body are playing tricks on you. Good luck and try to just forget about it for a while.|`|aeuWwrehaa	i just had those symptoms and af showed up on the 27th i was 14 days late. but i hope you get your BFP|`|LQminEIEaa	We're trying to conceive and apparently the white discharge can mean that its a sign that your ovulating. I'm not due until Feb 6th and i'm experiencing the same symptoms except the the watery pink blood. I've done a test 5 days ago but was negative.  I'll cross fingers for both of us.  Good luck.
AA11065140	Oh, hells no!  When my daughter was a teenager, we also had rules about no exposed undergarments, no plumber-butt, no pajamas in public, and no hair colors that wouldn't have been created by God.    Honestly, it's not parenting to allow this.  One of the things parents are supposed to teach is self respect.  Walking out of the house like that makes the assumption that the poor girl thinks her only value is in her sexuality.  Your stepmom isn't doing her any favors by allowing this to happen, trust me.  And your dad is doing no one any favors by living without a spine.    Yes, she's being quite the hypocrite.  And if you're up for it, you can tell her I said so.|`|EcuxBmFiaa	hey no I would not let her wear that and your dad should be ashamed  of that. You should try talking to them if not your sister is going to be pregnant or something|`|AA11057741	Obviously not.  I just feel for you and I hope others who are considering divorce/re marrying will read this and see how it affects the children....sad,sad,sad.  Sorry you have to deal with this nonsense!|`|RaobKLK5aa	NOT IN A MILLION YEARS! JUST REMEMBER THE WAYYOU DRESS IS THE WAY PEOPLE WILL TREAT YOU.IF YOU DRESS LIKE A TRAMP ,GANG BANGER .........ETC..............YOUR GONNA GET TREATED THAT WAY.|`|31sPPNpTaa	I would never let my daughter wear a low cut dress and stripper boots!  That's a fashion nightmare!  You don't wear boots w/ a dress!  Come on now!|`|AKFtOVeQaa	Well, I have a 13-year-old daughter,  and yeah, I would let her wear that.  As long as she's comfy and happy,  then I'm happy. (:|`|kVIOtS5gaa	no. she's letting her get attention from the wrong types of people ex: MEN. shes too young for that type of thing which can lead her to do other things much earlier than she should be doing them like sex.    not good. hopefully she doesnt get knocked up by a 20 year old|`|3Psi4kBxaa	NO NO|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	I am sorry, did you say 13 year old daughter?  WTF?????? Parents needs to loose a child for this crap|`|a1ymHaWAaa	if you want her 2 work the corner it would be fine...Not 4 my child|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Parent's get worn down over time.  For older children, you have to put up with "Be in by 8:00 or you're grounded."  Younger kids end up with "Don't use the good spoons for the heroin."     I wouldn't stress about who gets to wear what.  As long as everything is covered, don't sweat it.  If she is behaving, and not screwing around, I don't think it is that big of a deal.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	I would not even wear that! and im 15!    When my daughters are 13..no way in hell are they wearing sh*t like that!!!|`|xOr67VDiaa	Your step mum must be a complete moron, who cares what ppl think on the damn net, what about the dirty men out in the street.. your step mom is helping your little sister in a very dangerous situation, and with the more attention she will most likely do things she regrets for the rest of her life, its not the clothes, its the sick ppl in the world that dont care she is just a kid, they cant see that.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	No to both the dress and the boots.   Stripper boots have that name for a reason.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i don't think she should. and i'm surprised your dad lets her out of the house like that.. i hope they have extra room for the baby she is going to be bringing home soon!!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	HE** NO|`|OCxkv2bNaa	that just sounds like a bad idea to dress like that. I definitely think that your stepmom should talk her out of looking like a 13-year-old stripper. If not, then try to tell her how ridiculous it is to be concerned about how men view you when you're what, an 8th grader?|`|YsQQ30YJaa	No. That's just crazy. Especially these days.|`|10mOwk0Taa	um, no she should definitely not be wearing those kinds of clothes.  Your stepmom is waaay out of line.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	nopee..never.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	no to the outfit.. the only exception would be if she was going to a dance. then she should be able to pick her outfit.|`|3MW4ZObsaa	Yes, if she refuses, try hitting her|`|gGor2COOaa	No!  I would never let my daughter out of the house like that.|`|PyGMZPHGaa	oooo baby thats hot|`|D9axbzwzaa	DUH? DO YOU WANT THER TO BE A VIRGIN 4 HER WHOLE LIFE?|`|zctI1qRLaa	fapfapfap|`|nz8o3lLSaa	If she wants to get paid, she better know damn well that she wears what I want her to.  You make sure your mother gets that message.|`|THdnS1f4aa	Ironically, it appears as though your stepmother has succumbed to the very thing she was trying to protect you from; Lucifer himself.    These Harry Potter books are going to be the end of civilization as we know it.  It starts with parents allowing their children to wear stripper boots, but soon they'll be moving into things like drugs, premarital sex, and even FFA in some of the more extreme cases.    Your only hope now is to try to exorcise the demons that have possessed your stepmother's soul.  If you can't afford any of the big name exorcists like a Perkins or a Pollard, you could try some of the more generic companies, such as Exorcists 'R Us, or Exorcism Unlimited.    But if you're looking for a completely free alternative, try hitting her.|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	HELL NO!!! I think your stepmom needs to get her head tested, seriously.
n081l915aa	I think you're on the right track. You should teach her the value of having these things, and you should explain to her that some people aren't as lucky as she is. I think that you should tell her that people work to get her these things that she treats so poorly. If she wants something from now on, make her work for it (age-appropriate, of course). That ought to teach her the value of working hard and getting something in return for it.     I think your mother is being a little unfair to you and your girls. What you're thinking about doing doing is fair, because it sets a good example for the young one. The older one takes care of her things, so she is responsible enough for more. Try it for a couple of holidays and see what happens.|`|10mOwk0Taa	While I do agree with you I'm hesitant to say go for it.  You could end up scarring her mentally, and there could be an underlying medical/hormonal problem as to why she is SOOO forgetful.  If she is really that much more forgetful than others her age, then you should see a doctor.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	I think it would be more cruel to not teach her such a valuable life lesson before it's too late for her to learn it. I would say you're idea is the best thing you can do for her and your mother will need to respect your decision.|`|vfBG0vV0aa	don't give her anything but food   it will work, I guarantee|`|m2aznd8xaa	im in the very same boat .it sounds like your talking about my daughter.im at my wits end too.she is the same with leaving her sweaters on the bus. lossing her ds games . everything you said  my 9 year old is the same way . ive tryed everything. i think we spoil them too much. they are so used to getting all they want.   i now have a 20 month old and tell her to set good examples for her sister but that dont help.i too stopped buying her what she wants. i told her only birthdays and christmas shed get stuff and only when she outgrows something.but what can i say i dont know what works .but just to let you know you are not alone and .just remember they dont stay kids forever and  hopefully when they make there own money they will know what its like to save money for what they want and know nothing is free.and you got to work hard for what you want. i tell my daughter that all the time.  good luck  ive heard it gets harder when they turn teen so lets brace ourselves.|`|9AnNb7Tbaa	Yes. If you dont assign chores for her at a young age, she will be messed up for life, be lazy and ALWAYS refuse to do something. My mom always did things for me and it was very tough when she starting making me do something.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	I agree with you 100 percent.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	I would say no presents for valentines day,easter and st pattys day.But I do believe that no present for her birthday is kinda mean|`|5D0KuT74aa	not at all  she breaks/loses it  she doesn't get any new ones|`|RrPjG9x9aa	go for it.  she's gotta get the message somehow.  and good for you for having expectations for your child and not just picking up after her all the time.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	No! Not at all!    Then she will realize how appreciative she'll be with her belongings.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	I don't think you're being cruel or unreasonable at all. Your younger daughter shouldn't be getting any new things if she can't take care of what she has now. There are plenty of children around the world who don't have as many nice things as she might have, and she shouldn't be getting new things until she proves she'll be able to take care of them.    You aren't being unfair to her, because your older daughter is being responsible with her belongings and that's why she's getting presents.

Detto questo, ritengo  che un bambino di tre mesi sia comunque un po' troppo piccolo per il nido, tenendo conto che la vita comunitaria  una bellissima esperienza dove per  molto facile beccarsi tutti i mali di stagione, quindi se puoi organizzarti sarebbe meglio aspettare almeno i sei mesi.

mc1XXWMpaa	First, check out this website. Its great. www.thebabywearer.com    I'd also suggest checking out some on-line babywearing videos. YouTube seems to have alot. Here is one:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CvGggmgx...    It all depends on how old your baby is. I remember when my son was a newborn it was pretty easy to wear him in a pouch sling, but between 3-6 months it seemed really awkward. Once he was old enough I found the hip carry very easy to use. We still use that one and he's 16 months.    Also, if you know of a Babywearing store nearby you could ask the staff for advice. There is a small store in my city which offers Babywearing 101. They teach you how to use your slings.  Hope it helps! Your baby will enjoy being worn.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I have a hotsling and love it. How old is your baby? For small babies the cradle hold is good although my son didn't like having his legs all squished up. We stopped using it until he was 3 months and able to use it sitting up and I just used one hand to keep him more stable. We use it every day now, it takes some practice.    http://www.hotslings.com/wearing_instruc...  http://www.hotslings.com/wearing_instruc...|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i bought one by boppy , baby liked it but no matter what i did i could not look down and see her face....so i did NOT like it...depends on the kind you have, but i think a lot of ppl find that some slings are just not for them; hope u r not one of them since you got it off ebay...i like the baby bjorn much better....|`|rTACLd3Saa	Most of the companies have web sites that show how to use the sling, positions, etc.  I know Maya wrap has a pretty detailed site.  That's the type I have.
3p7q7H2Faa	Grazie al cielo ci sono persone come te che hanno il coraggio di dire con sincerit la propria opinione. Non preoccuparti e non stupirti delle altrui reazioni: in un paese bigottamente ottuso come l'Italia sono pi che normali. Quando l'argomento riguarda l'avere o meno dei figli alcuni diventano totalmente intolleranti e avanzano le proprie convinzioni come dogmi incontrovertibili; pensano che siccome loro hanno provato grandissima gioia nel crescere dei bambini, tutti debbano necessariamente possedere il loro istinto e la loro propensione: si sbagliano. Io e la mia ragazza attualmente e credo anche in futuro non vogliamo figli. Non ne sentiamo intimamente il desiderio. Tutto qui. Si aggiungano, in secondo piano, l'impossibilit economica di mantenerlo, e le infinite difficolt e stress che comporta crescere ed educare un figlio, in una societ come l'attuale. Aggiungerei un'altra osservazione: attenzione a quelle coppie che dicono di volere un figlio per "completarsi", come suggello della propria unione; alcune di queste coppie stanno andando alla deriva e cercano di tappare le falle del proprio rapporto grazie alla nascita di un bimbo. Niente di pi sbagliato: quel bimbo diventer un pacco postale dopo il divorzio.|`|ZZBbCrxFaa	Io non li ho mai potuti soffrire. Non sei l'unica. Lascio agli altri questa "gioia". Io, dal canto mio, sto divinamente senza. Ciao!|`|310788224e5ec133ac769e70a159ba65aa	Sopratutto nel forno con patate.....|`|bqaHkPPeaa	Guarda, la mia ira non te la attiri anche se ho un'idea diametralmente opposta alla tua.    A me i bambini piacciono tantissimo!  Mi sono sempre piaciuti e sono sempre riuscita ad instaurare un buon rapporto con loro sin da subito.    Ma forse questo dipende dal fatto che sono sempre stata un p bambina anche io!  Ancora adesso che ho 36 anni mi diverto come una pazza a giocare con loro, a costruire improbabili castelli con le costruzioni, a vedere i cartoni animati, ad andare al parco e giocare insieme, etc.    Per quanto riguarda i pianti, ti dico che riesco a gestire abbastanza bene sia un neonato che un bimbo di et superiore, per ovviamente non pretendo che tutti siano come me.    Sono la zia di 6 bellissime nipotine!  Ho fatto pratica!!!    L'unica cosa che mi frena dall'avere un bimbo tutto mio  quella che hai citato alla fine del tuo post.  La situazione economica.    Il mio compagno ed io abbiamo cos tante spese cui far fronte che proprio non potremmo tirare su un bimbo in questo momento.  Tu non puoi immaginare quanto questo mi addolori anche perch non sono pi una ragazzina e rischio di non avere pi la possibilit di diventare madre.|`|uW37s3Luaa	certo ke mi piacciono sono cos carini come fai a non sopportarli?|`|9l6fPWZgaa	I bambini sono la piu' grande gioia del mondo,io li trovo a dir poco meravigliosi specie quando sono piccolini e allora puoi tenerli in braccio e coccolarli a piu' non posso,cm si puo' vivere senza di loro?!?!|`|IFoqODMiaa	tu dici cosi xche hai altri obbiettivi da finire come lo studio e poi trovare un lavoro ,fai bene,xro i bimbi e la gioia di ogni mamma io ne ho uno e lo amo piu della mia stessa vita poi quando un domani ti sei realizata e farai un bimbo la pensi cosi come me xche e una esperienza troppo belle da fare e se ritornerei in dietro farei la stessa cosa che ho fatto anche se ho 23 anni ciao auguri x tutto ciao un bacio|`|14C9YgLOaa	Personalmente non ho nulla conto i bambini, sono anche carini quando sono piccoli e degli altri. Io di mio non voglio avere figli, non ne sento il bisogno e credo che sar cos per sempre. Non c' nulla di sbagliato in te se non ami i bambini. Non  scritto da nessuna parte che perch sei donna devi per forza amare i bambini e sentire il bisogno di averli. Un bambino, dicono che riempie la vita di gioia, io dico che non  affatto vero: riempie di gioia soltanto se  voluto e amato e se i genitori possono dargli l' amore che merita. Non  essere egoisti il non volere figli,  essere responsabili. Secondo me sono egoisti quei genitori che vogliono figli solo per sentirsi realizzati, completi, come dicono loro, e poi non sono in grado di dargli l' affetto di cui hanno bisogno, e li trattano come pacchi postali da depositare presso nonni e amici.  Quindi non sentirti un mostro, sei solo una ragazza responsabile e con le idee ben chiare. Continua cos e fregatene delle ire che potresti scatenare in answer o nei tuoi familiari. La vita  tua e hai diritto di farci quello che vuoi.|`|b8me5bfbaa	a me si, tantissimo, non c' cosa pi bella dei bambini;  esprimono dolcezza, purezza, anche se per ultimamente troppi gli abusi che subiscono, si sta stappando in fretta la loro innocenza...; odio le persone che fanno queste cose; solo dei mostri possono fare del male ai bambini................... scusate lo sfogo.|`|tX2OdFaFaa	l'et nn conta nulla x avere un figlio,io sono diventata mamma a 18 anni.  sul fatto di economicamente se nn sei apposto aspetta un po prima di farne uno.  quando sarai in cinta ti verrano fuori tutta la voglia x averlo al piu presto,te ne accorgerai quando ne avrai uno tutto tuo,nn gli faresti mancare nulla tutto  suo!!  ti abbitueresti ai piantini,a cambiare pannolini ecc..  stai trancuilla che prima o poi la voglia ti verra!!  baci da stella ciao|`|26fc489cc07b8e94263c04efa5fcd071aa	meglio cos, meglio che tu non diventi mamma perch te lo dicono, fallo quando te lo senti, anzi da come scrivi sarebbe meglio non ne facessi proprio, la cosa peggiore sarebbe quella di una mamma che non ama i bambini,  un controsenso e poi fare soldi prima di fare figli non serve a niente; l'importante  l'amore che puoi dare, non il passeggino alla moda. Se preferisci la carriera meglio per te e non fare figli, pi in l nel tempo forse te ne pentirai, ma non essere egoista pi di quanto tu possa esserlo gi ora. Comunque sei stata sincera, brava.|`|eb3358b1f26b407f4c7c3352a327fe99aa	Quanto sei povera dentro..................|`|IEsGGDNkaa	sai che ti capisco?  ho 22 anni anche io e lavoro a contatto con i bimbi dai 3 ai 6 anni tutti i santi giorni e ti assicuro che li adoro...solo che purtroppo certe volte portano veramente all'esaurimento tra gnole pianti e urli!    a me piacerebbe avere un bimbo,in effetti 22 anni sono pochini poi lavorando cosi a stretto contatto con i bimbi quando ne vedo uno pestifero dico "cavolo e se mi uscisse come quello????"  poi per capisco di essere afezzionata solo ai bambini degli altri...e forse sarebbe piu' bello essere afezzionata ad uno tutto mio  non trovi?  baci|`|95e0d39d0c76b906450724977501bf99aa	No assolutamente, appena riesco a sopportare i miei nipoti giusto perche' sono figli dei miei fratelli e solo qualche decina di minuti, poi scappo..  I bambini degli sconosciuti li odio proprio devono essere dei santerellini fermi come statue per piacermi, come sono un minimo agitati li caccerei fuori a sberle.  Odio ancora di piu' i genitori permissivi che permettono di fare tutto al figlio quando si trovano in locali pubblici e se mi ci trovo gliene dico 4 ai genitori di tenere i figli a posto perche' non sono a casa loro..    brrrrrr brutti i bambini.. non ne voglio e non ne avro' mai!!|`|xI8jLLCJaa	io li adoro.....|`|ef021f4944908af42e23d610d766552daa	Si e tanto: uno perch essere genitori  una scelta responsabile ma non solo per questo ma essere accanto alla crescita di un figlio o figlia  qualcosa di amorevolmente impagabile.  Mi piacerebbe tanto un giorno essere genitore , per adesso non lo sono ma mi piacerebbe tanto.  Alleno da anni dei ragazzini giovani in atletica leggera ed  bello vederli crescere con il tuo aiuto:  un'emozione unica.  Ma vorrei diventare padre per dare tutte le possibilit di una splendida vita ad un figlio o figlia, perch la vita  una cosa incredibilmente bella.|`|AEKcoF8Qaa	ciao io sono una ragazza di 20anni a 19 sono rimasta incinta e a 20 ho partorito...la mia scelta  stata di non abortire nonostante io si giovane e ancora piena di vita, ma ti diro ho lottato per questa bambina per averla e ti giuro ke ho passato momenti da schifo,e io non sn stabile economicamente ma a lei non manca e non manchera mai niente...ora  nella culla ke dorme il 13 maggio fa 2mesi ed  tutta la mia vita...non c'entra l'et...poi vedrai qnd diventerai mamma e mi saprai dire qnt  bello....un bacione  :-)|`|UtfFxBKqaa	Non ne sono mai andata pazza anche perch in famiglia non c'erano bimbi tantomeno piccoli ma da quando  nato mio figlio, beh mi ritrovo a sorridere a tutti i bimbi mentre prima li ignoravo completamente!|`|ihGokONvaa	Per niente!

Alla tua et  normale non sentire il desiderio di maternit, cos come  normale scambiare per desiderio di maternit quello che invece  un grande vuoto interiore lasciato dalla perdita di persone tanto amate. Mi spiego, e ti racconto la mia esperienza in breve.  Mi sono sposata a 22 anni, il mese prima era morto mio padre, dopo pochi mesi (4)  morta anche mia madre. Ho voluto subitissimo un figlio, e subito dopo l'altro (i miei figli hanno un anno e mezzo di differenza) col risultato che quando il secondo aveva tre mesi ho ripreso il lavoro perch letteralmente non sopportavo pi di stare sempre e solo con loro.  Forse non ero pronta (anzi, certamente non lo ero), ho voluto precipitare le cose, e probabilmente in questo modo mi sono persa tanto della loro infanzia..tante cose che adesso rimpiango (adesso sono grandi...21 e 22 anni e mezzo).  Io penso che tu faccia bene a voler essere certa di desiderarli i figli, prima di metterli al mondo. E' la miglior assicurazione per la tua e la loro serenit. Auguri :-)|`|e333ca273f31db34a57e9797ada6cf28aa	no, mi spiace tanto ma i bambini non li affronto..|`|f6226d33c427fc9613c705956c806511aa	mah, io ho fatto la baby sitter e la ragazza alla pari, e penso che mi piaceranno di piu0 tra una decina d'anni....|`|02f515339f28161b237fa77052c2435faa	A me piacciono, quando non fanno capricci! Se ci fai caso la stragrande maggioranza dei bambini sono molto capricciosi, e se metti a confrono i bimbi italiano con quelli stranieri noterai che quelli italiani lo sono in maniera esagerata. Ti  mai capitato di vedere un bimbo tedesco che al supermercato urla a squarciagola perch vuole la caramella? A me no......Direi proprio che sono capricciosi per colpa dei genitori che gli concedono tutto!    Tu vai avanti per la tua strada e se tra qualche anno avrai il desiderio di diventare mamma ok, altrimenti continua come al solito. Non  essenziale avere un figlio per sentirsi realizzati.|`|v1YckIUQaa	Mi piacciono ma sto iniz a pensare ke  meglio se nn ne avr!|`|F56vDIklaa	ciao lalla allora premetto che sono una mamma di una bimba di otto anni, mia figlia l' ho avuta a diciannove anni e non  stata certo una cosa programmata per a quell' et si  pi irresponsabili e si pensa ancora che il mondo sia tutto rose e fiori e che con l' amore si supera tutto. Ora io amo mio marito e pure mia figlia per in questi anni ho imparato che le favole non esistono che il mondo  pieno di spine che pungono e fanno molto male ora non sto qua a raccontarti tutte le mie disavventure ti dico solo che pur non rimpiangendo la mia scelta in genere non amo i bambini li odio tutti a parte mia figlia e condivido tutto quello che dici forse le mie parole ti stupiranno e ti potr sembrare un contro senso che una madre dica queste cose. Anche io come te sono stata accusata e criticata tante volte perch non ho intenzione di fare altri figli perch non me lo posso permettere e perch non mi va molti mi hanno detto che sono egoista e che dovrei fare un altro figlio per dare una compagnia a mia figlia che non  giusto resti sola e che non centra se non hai i soldi se non sai dove metterlo a dormire se non hai i soldi per dargli tutto quello a cui a diritto vorrei sapere come cazzo ragionano queste persone . Ripeto io amo mia figlia e faccio di tutto per farle avere una vita il pi tranquilla possibile e non farle mancare niente ma  molto molto difficile non voglio e non desidero altri figli e ritengo che nessuno ha il diritto di giudicare e criticare scelte cos importanti chi vuole figli che se li faccia senza rompere i coglioni agli altri.

Spero che possa aiutarti..!! ^_^|`|5222c74425c2927504f92b7fd5edabefaa	Sono sposata da non tanto, adoro i bimbi, ma non ne abbiamo ancora... Tuttavia, dai racconti delle amiche e colleghe ho appreso che il parto  DAVVERO il momento pi bello per una donna, una mia collega mi ha garantito che l'attimo in cui il piccolo esce da te, quella frazione di secondo tra il dentro e il fuori,  un istante che lascia una sensazione magica, unica, irripetibile. Se hai tanta paura, pensa che c' l'anestesia epidurale, una mia amica era terrorizzata dal parto e l'ha chiesta al ginecologo:  andato tutto bene.   Se devo essere sincera, pi che la gravidanza a me spaventano altre cose: vi  mai capitato di pensare, per es. di restare incinta, fare mille progetti sul bimbo, vederlo perfetto come tutti i genitori sperano sia il proprio pargolo, magari immaginarlo bello/a e roseo/a... e poi mettere al mondo un figlio MALATO,  oppure con malformazioni? Questo mi terrorizza, e non ditemi che un figlio si ama lo stesso, magari  vero, ma.... quanta forza  necessaria per accudire e crescere un essere tale?....  (oddio, perdonami, ti ho aggiunto una paura invece che toglierti quelle che avevi gia'...)|`|fNONaEAvaa	insomma.. far male ma non morirai!  e poi vuoi mettere la gioia di avere un figlio e crescerlo?  ne vale la pena...|`|GTNhsfbRaa	Non dobbiamo convincerti noi.

Scrivimi in pvt se vuoi... ciao  Chiara|`|y8uA3BUAaa	guarda  la stessa mia paura il dolore mi spaventa,per credo che in quel momento si pensi a tutt'altro che al dolore pensa a quando stringerai tra le braccia tuo figlio...sar un'emozione talmente grande poter dare la vita a qualcuno...|`|yrZnKa4Waa	mi sento esattamete come ti senti te! anche se sn ancora giovane, gia ci penso spesso. cmq prova a farti coraggio, alla fine ce la facciamo tutte! :-)|`|DjBijg2Baa	jennifer ha ragione!alla fine ce la facciamo tutte!!!E dai retta a me ,non ti fermare a uno!!!Pensa che lascerai, lungo il tuo cammino, una parte di te che proseguir!!|`|nf42mum2aa	un bambino e la cosa pi pura e pi bella del mondo....la voglia che ti viene di vederlo ti fa dimenticare i dolori del parto|`|btgPZYTWaa	Ciao!Se proprio sei una fifona ed ai paura del parto,fai un bimbo e poi scegli di partorire con l'epidurale,soffrirai molto di meno.Comunque quella e la paura un po di tutte noi donne,ma eccoci qua siamo sopravissute tutte a quel dolore.Ciao non avere paura tutto passera.|`|etwxDE2uaa	Le donne (purtroppo non tutte) hanno avuto da Dio il dono di mettere al mondo altri esserini(ed hanno, grazie a madre natura,  tutto ci che serve per affrontare una prova cos difficile). Non devi assolutamente avere paura di affrontare una gioia talmente grande come la maternit. E' qualcosa che non si pu descrivere ma che posso dirti con estrema certezza,  non dimenticherai mai nella tua vita e non ti pentirai per un solo secondo di aver vissuto una cosa cos meravigliosa.|`|23f51b5df31399bdf28498b9016f3b23aa	Il dolore molto intenso che si prova dirante il travaglio e che non si puo' togliere (anche con l'epidurale si soffre comunque per diverse ore, perche' non puo' essere praticato finche' non c'e' un'apertura di almeno 4 cm, cioe' alcune ore di dolore-- esperienza diretta), non e' niente se confrontato con le difficolta' che si incontrano dopo. Ci sono mille difficolta', dall'allattamento (che per me e' stato un vero problema, mai risolto), alla responsabilita' (che e' della mamma, almeno per l'80%), ai disturbi dei piccoli, alle corse casa-asilo-lavoro-nonni, alle ore di sonno perse, agli anni di responsabilita' che verranno ancora...................  pero' la mia bimba e' la cosa piu' importante della mia vita, la persona alla quale sacrificherei la mia vita, probabilmente la persona che mi ama di piu' e che sa dimostrarmelo teneramente. Pensi che avrei rinunciato a questo per evitarmi 4 insulse ore di sofferenza tremenda, rispetto agli anni meravigliosi che avremo davanti? E quante donne che hanno gia' avuto un figlio, dopo travagli di 10-12 ore, e senza epidurale, hanno deciso di farne un secondo, o un terzo? Sono donne super? O credi che sopportassero meglio di te il dolore? Io credo di no, credo che abbiano sofferto tantissimo, ma che abbiano deciso di vivere appieno la loro vita. Io credo che nella vita bisogna tirar fuori un po' di carattere, altrimenti si resta sempre fermi "al palo".  E' comunque anche importante sapere quello a cui si va incontro, per questo ho voluto smentire chi dice che si puo' fare un parto senza dolore. E poi il taglio cesareo non si puo' chiedere; intanto perche' e' un intervento chirurgico che si fa solo se necessario, ed e' meglio evitare, e poi perche' i medici non te lo fanno solo perche' hai paura di soffrire.  Quindi se vuoi veramente un figlio cerca di tirare fuori un po' di carattere e tanti auguri!!|`|C91UlOw7aa	La gravidanza non dovrebbe preoccuparti, anzi... il tuo corpo si modifica ma sostanzialmente non c' niente di cui preoccuparsi, visto che il tuo corpo fa tutto da solo... per il parto invece posso solo dirti che anche io avevo paura ma nel momento in cui sono iniziate le prime contrazioni la paura, anzich aumentare,  andata scemando, in quanto era una sensazione che non avevo mai provato e che si presentava nuova... avrei molti pi pensieri adesso a farne un altro piuttosto che al primo!!!  E poi, se proprio dici di avere la soglia del dolore bassa, le soluzione sono diverse, potresti decidere per un parto indotto (anche se secondo me saresti ancora pi in ansia perch avresti una data precisa), potresti fare una visita anestesiologica qualche settimana prima di partorire di modo che appena la dilatazione lo render possibile ti verr praticata l'anestesia epidurale che ti render insensibile dal bacino in gi (la visita ovviamente si consiglia qualche settimana prima del termine anzich direttamente in sala parto, perch cos si eviterebbe di perdere altro tempo e si potrebbe somministrare subito l'anestesia), oppure rimane l'ultima possibilit, la quale penso sia una stupidaggine se non esistono rischi particolari per la mamma o per il bambino, cio il taglio cesareo. Oggi sento sempre pi spesso dire che donne si sono fatte operare (perch di operazione si tratta) per evitare il dolore del parto, incoonsapevoli per che la riabilitazione post partum  assai pi dura di quella di un parto vaginale; con un cesareo ci vogliono 5 giorni di degenza anzich 3, ci sono i punti da togliere e controlli da fare per la cicatrice e il ritorno a casa presenta diversi problemi a livello motorio.  Capirai perch sconsiglio questa ultima opzione.....  Spero di averti fatto in qualche modo riflettere su un'eventuale gravidanza, e di non avere ulteriormente accentuato i tuoi dubbi!!!! Ti auguro seriamente una gravidanza e un parto favolosi come  stato il mio, spero di risentirti e che finalmente ci annuncerai di aspettare un beb, incrociamo le dita!!!|`|6MBHLfkNaa	Lascia perdere.   Se hai paura della gravidanza e del parto (che sono belli e facili) ti manca del tutto la capacit di essere una buona madre (che  bello, ma non facile).|`|UQOtwnZVaa	pensa ke dopo avrai un figlio tutto tuo da amare e da accudire e ke essere madri e la cosa + bella del mondo xo se hai veramente paura nn essere tu  volerlo ma il destino, se accadra lo terrai se devi essere tu a crearlo di tua spontanea volonta  poi hai paura... e meglio ke nn fai questo grande passo|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Vai tranquilla e serena e soprattutto non prestare ascolto a racconti di esperienze che hanno fatto altre donne (parlo di quelle che potrebbero impressionare ed influenzare dunque impedire una scelta personale  ) , fai la tua...    bacione|`|8WwUyMgxaa	pensa a quello ke succede dopo la gravidanza e il parto!!!  pensa a ttt i bei momenti ke passerai insieme al tuo bambino e non pensare alle tue paure!!!    mi raccomando scegli 1 bel nome!!!!!!|`|zKH8af0Faa	Ogni persona ha una soglia di percezione del dolore diversa.Nessuno pu spiegare il dolore,solo chi lo prova.Se hai intenzione di avere un figlio,non esiste nessuna persona al mondo che possa convincerti.La decisione dentro di te l'hai gi presa|`|VBRQZAzRaa	Cara Cinzia,  una paura comprensibile e perfettamente naturale. Prova a pensare che come te l'hanno avuta miliardi di donne finora, e l'avranno altri miliardi di donne d'ora in poi, eppure ce l'avete sempre fatta, e il risultato  questa nostra bella umanit di sei miliardi d'individui. Prova a pensare che anche il dolore che si prova  un dolore profondo ma del tutto 'naturale' (riporto parole che mi sono state dette, perch non sono una donna!), e che quindi  fatto proprio dalla natura in modo da poterlo superare. E soprattutto prova a pensare alla ricompensa che avrai per averlo superato, il tuo primo figlio, che costituir la ragione della tua vita e il tuo pi profondo amore per i tempi successivi, il tuo tesoro e il tuo capolavoro. Nella vita ogni cosa buona e degna  figlia dei nostri dolori pi profondi. Non temere. Vedrai! :)|`|cfm2gNUVaa	Avere paura di qualcosa che non si conosce  pi che comprensibile. Posso comunque dirti che la gravidanza non  una malattia, per cui la si pu vivere come una parentesi meravigliosa della vita. Il parto  sicuramente doloroso ma segna l' inizio di quello che sar il percorso pi straordinario che una madre possa vivere. Solo provando te ne renderai conto. Ciaooo!!|`|njxMAb7gaa	Cinzia, siamo tutti passati da li',,,,,,,,,,,,, la donna e' predisposta a questo tipo di dolore , e' un dolore naturale, poi basti pensare che la maggior parte delle donne dicono che si e' doloroso ma poi te lo dimentichi subito, quindi nn e' cosi' traumatico. Fatti forza, che vedrai sara' l'eperienza piu' bella della tua vita.|`|1e30f3ce922f478cf27d143cd89b04aeaa	beh per la paura del parto il rimedio c' se proprio non vuoi affrontarlo chiedi il cesareo ed ecco risolto. Per la paura della gravidanza....secondo me se desideri veramente un bambino non devi nemmeno pensare a questo tipo di paura, pu darsi che tutto vada x il meglio e non ti accorgi nemmeno di essere incinta, pu darsi che soffrirai di qualche disturbo ma cmq la gioia , le sensazioni di sentire la tua creatura crescere, muoversi dentro di te ti riempiono talemente tanto che qualsiasi malessere tu possa avere passa in secondo piano. Non farti paranoie inituli e goditi prima la gravidanza che  un'esperienza unica e meravilgiosa e poi il tuo bb che veramente ti riempie di felicit, di gioia.... considera che io sono di nuovo incinta a distanza di meno di un anno dalla prima proprio perch desideravo un'altra gravidanza!!!!!!! in bocca al lupo e lasciati andare al tuo istinto!!!!!!!!!|`|u2oGja9aaa	anche io avevo tanta paura figurati avevo paura di vomitare di farmi fare le analisi del sangue insoma avevo paura di tuto pero ti asicuro che ne o pasate tante 23 ore di travaglio urlavo piangevo insieme a mio marito pero alla fine e venuto al mondo la creatura piu bella piu brava piu buona del universo la paura e il dolore pasa secondo me devi aver paura dopo che non sai cosa sucede perche piange perche singhioza perche vomita............baci|`|dg1jJDoiaa	per me diventare madre sarebbe la cosa pi bella al mondo...vedere una persona che hai procreati tu...solo tu...e che ti chiama mamma o ti sorride... la cosa pi bella al mondo...ti rende felice...la vita  una sola perch non provare...poi hanno partorito milioni di donne e sono sicura che tu sarai una mamma fantastica...ciao ciao|`|c38810eea20395ed4741cc57c88fbb54aa	Io ho tre figli.

r7q8LW7Aaa	I wouldn't worry about it - if it were that dangerous, the cans would have warnings on them. Many people drink, smoke, eat things they're not supposed to before they find out they're pregnant, and I have yet to hear of someone who caused harm from it!  Congratulations though :-D|`|3sIoLMsVaa	Relax...they mean do not continue using that for instance if you are a painter! It is way to early for the child..which is actually nothing at the moment to be even harmed. I went bungee jumping when I was pregnant and drank a lot considering I did not know. My child is well and healthy. You are fine!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Don't worry at all. You weren't to know were you? Before I found out I was pregnant I donated blood, got pushed off a table rather violently (lol), consumed a lot of alcohol (friend's 18th) and rolled down a grass slope (mature I know ha) and my baby is fine. A lot of women don't find out they are pregnant until a bit later than you, and do stuff like that but turn out fine. I'd say stop worrying - what's done is done, you can't change it and worrying isn't good for your baby :) if you're really concerned talk to your GP about it, i'm sure that would help reassure you more. Good luck and congrats!|`|aytp005Xaa	Well its too late now to do anything about it so just keep an eye on things.. like bleeding.  Enjoy ur pregnancy! :D|`|HNPxTlnkaa	Plus I didn't even know I was pregnant when I was painting!    There you go.  What you don't know, can't hurt you.  |`|vIWh4id1aa	go to a doctor and check ur stil pregnant tell him about the issue and he should come up with a conclusion!

2sJUGqddaa	Ciao..secondo me l'aborto  un'operazione molto triste per i genitori del bambino e sopratutto per la madre che si sente strappare via una parte di s! Comunque lo trovo giusto, perch se due persone non hanno mezzi per occuparsi di un bambino, oppure lo considerano uno sbaglio  corretto non metterlo al mondo piuttosto che farlo soffrire e non dargli una vita degna, confortevole e piena di amore! Un ultima cosa, sono contraria all'aborto dei 5 mesi e dei 9 mesi perch il bambino anche se non  ancora nato, ha percepito la voce della sua mamma e del suo pap e a grandi linee l'atmosfera che ci sar attorno a lui/lei! E' meglio abortire i primi mesi! Kiss|`|aYBkKwdvaa	Qualcuno dice che in casi estremi, la giovane et, una malattia, i problemi economici, la paura di dirlo ai genitori l'aborto sia giustificabile, non giudico chi l'ha fatto, personalmente non lo condivido perch sono contraria, per nessuna ragione al mondo si dovrebbe eliminare una giovane vita che sta nascendo....|`|I4Na8GRDaa	 un omicidio legalizzato|`|QeJmkHslaa	Io sono contraria, a meno che non sia in pericolo la vita della madre.

Nelle gravidanze pi avanzate (spesso inlegalei) poi si partorisce e si lascia il bimbo a morire di freddo e di fame. Qualsiasi cosa sia successo che colpa ne ha quell'esserino innocente e indifeso?

3904fbf005e6b4c5209f593b2033a295aa	Tu ragis au 1er degr devant l'horreur comme moi au dpart & puis, j'ai pris le temps de me documenter sur le sujet mme si c'est assez tabou. En fait, il s'agit de dmence puerprale (c'est le terme psychiatrique). Il y a tout un contexte qui se met en place au niveau familial & qui fait que la femme est incapable d'assumer sa grossesse & en mme temps est incapable d'envisager une interruption volontaire ou une contraception ... c'est pour ?a qu'il n'y a rcidive que si le contexte n'volue pas & qu'elles sont capables de laisser certains enfants en vie & pas d'autres. Ces femmes ont une ide si haute & parfaite de l'ducation que paradoxalement, c'est un acte d'amour pour elle de leur ?ter la vie. En gros, elle leur pargne de ne pas avoir une vie digne d'eux. Le sujet est vritablement complexe & il n'est pas du tout vident de dpasser son sentiment d'horreur pour le comprendre. Si tu veux le comprendre de fa?on simple, je te conseille l'excellent roman de Mazarine Pingeot, Le Cimetire des Poupes, qui vient de para?tre aux ditions Juillard.

KL24imFBaa	i had my daughter's done about a week before she turned 4 months. she's 11 months now and doesnt bother them. she cried for maybe a minute. the cleaning isnt bad. twist them once a day at least. i used to clean them when she would take her morning nap or right after a bath. don't get super expensive ones, no diamonds. lol. make sure they are gold though, those are less likely to cause problems. i never had problems with my first holes (got them when i was 3 months) but always got infections in my other ones (have 4 in each ear) after the 12 weeks you can change the earrings and clean them every other day. my daughter's get cleaned once a week or so when i change them out with the cleaning solution on a qtip. she hasnt had any problems with them and the dont get dirty ( i clean her ears with a washclothe in the tub daily)|`|4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	 I'd say the chances of her being allergic when both mom and grandma are allergic is pretty high. AND it is a lot of hassle to have your baby look cute. Soon after though, you'll get sick of cleaning them all the time and switching out the earrings or one will get lost and that will be the end of it. You would have put your daughter through unnecessary pain and yourself through fighting with her to keep them clean praying they don't get infected for nothing. Our plan is to let our daughter decide when she's ready. Explain that it WILL hurt a little and we will have to take care of them, but when she's ready we'll do it. She may never want her ears pierced who knows? We just feel like it's her body, her choice. Why put either of you through it now?|`|nkSRIq0Iaa	Our daughter is nine months old and my bf and I agree that we want it to be her decision to get her ears pierced. I think it's totally unnecessary to put a baby through pain for the sake of looking cute. Plus their little bodies are perfect and untainted, who are we to alter them?     I mean absolutely no offense to parent's who do pierce their children's ears. Just MHO.|`|PHzyDoKuaa	getting them pierced young is the best.  because 90% of all girls want there ears pierced.    and if you get good quality earrings, she shouldn't have an allergic reaction.  and since she can't really touch or mess with her ears they will heal quicker and will be easier to take care of.      |`|AA11987492	IMHO, I think that you should wait. Who are we to go around putting holes in our children's bodies without their consent?     I believe that we have the right to own our own bodies. I had my ears pierced as an infant and I hate it. I don't like to wear jewelry. I am not against it, it just isn't "me". So now I have these 2 empty holes in my ears that look ridiculous. *I* had NO say in this, even though it is MY body. I have the same feelings about circumcision. Who are we to steal a child's foreskin. It is a purely cosmetic procedure that has no medical benefits.|`|5eoO6qosaa	I would not allow my daughters to get their ears pierced until they were 13. That way they were old enough to decide if they really wanted their ears pierced, 4 did but one still doesn't, shes 22. Plus they were in a age group where they could be responsible for the care of their ears, I checked on them, but they took care of them. The 22 year old is still happy that I gave her a choice. |`|8Jaxpop4aa	My daughter is 13 months old and she still haven't gotten her eyes pierced yet and her father and I don't have any plans on getting them done anytime soon either. When shes old enough to say she wants them pierced then that's when she'll get it done. I got my ears piecred at the age of 13 and they hurt like crap so just think about how it would feel to a baby. Not so good so think about it some more before making your final decision.    |`|df9ec06e0d3a2b528115ca45bd1867bdaa	i had my daughter's ears pierced when she was 3 months old.. right after her second set of shots.. and they weren't as big a hassle as i thought they were going to be..  she didn't play with them.  and my whole family has a problem with earrings.. but the ones they use for infants and children are nickel free... which is usually what gives you the irritation.. if you think she is ready go for it.. if you are nervous then wait...there is no rush its all up to you..  don't let people  push you into something you arent ready for her to have !  good luck! |`|788il3ZYaa	I agree that your daughter should be the one to make the decision not you.  I had my ears pieced (my choice not my parents).  They got infected and swelled up.  I would hate to put my daughter thru that.|`|wVxs317Haa	Personally, I wouldn't do it.  I look at it as causing a child pain for cosmetic reasons, and she can always choose to do it herself when she's older.    Plus, I don't like the look - it looks to me like the parents are trying to make a baby look grown up.      I remember the day I got my ears pierced - it was almost a right of passage, and I wouldn't want to give up that experience.  I wasn't allowed to have them done until I was 13, and I remember feeling so grown up & fabulous having them done.  Even the pain didn't bother me because I was so excited I was finally "old enough".  I would like to make my daughter's ear piercing a similar right of passage - piercing her ears as a baby seems like it's more for the mom than the little girl.|`|83Qly57Iaa	I agree that you should wait until your child ask for them, give her the choice. My experience: my 7 year old daughter begged her grandmother to get her ears pierced. And Grandma took her to get it done without my permission. I was wanting to wait until I knew she could take care of them herself. As it turns out, I was right...they were cool for about 3 months now she doesn't want to clean them, looses them cuz she has taken them out and now they keep closing back up.  So yes they may ask for them at any age, but I would make sure you know that she will take care of them.|`|AA11451523	i don't think you should do it. wait until she makes this decision. i am pretty sure she will come to you one day asking for it...she is so little for this...|`|D5dtvqb1aa	I have gotten my 2 oldest daughter's ears pierced when they were both 2 months, and will do it with my now 2 month old daughter once she gets her shots. I think it is a lot easier to do it when they are young because they don't play with them, and by the time they are able to, they don't because they don't realize it's not a part of them. I think taking care of them is a lot easier when they are little too, just clean them every time you change her diaper. Sure, she'll cry, but probably for not more than a minute and if you go to a reputable place, they should pierce both ears at once so they don't get double the pain.  |`|JdJpViIIaa	I think it's cute! Both of my nieces had theirs done when they were babies. Their earrings have to be real though otherwise their little ears will get infected. Plus cleaning them is not that much trouble just need some Clair's solution. A lot of people say they would wait until their child can talk and ask for them their self but they all come off to me as old fashioned crazys!!! LOL But if you do not have time than just simply tell Grandma that it can wait! =-)|`|ZVeGEdfUaa	My husband and l decided to hold off on getting our daughter's done. l didn't want her messing with them, making them loose, and having her choke on them because by some accident, one came out ( l know someone this happened to). We thought it would be a good idea to let her decide if she wants them done (if she wants them done). She will have to be old enough to take care of them herself, if she wants to. That's what my parents did for me. lf you are both allergic in one ear, l would definitely hold off until she is old enough to let you know there is a problem. lnfection can spread so quickly in infants. Good luck and l hope l was able to help!|`|01jTScB3aa	You should wait a while. Might want her to be 6 or so.|`|4wbpmpnSaa	DO NOT get her ears pierced until she wants to get them pierced. For all you know she doesn't. Do not make her do something that doesn't have any benefits what's-so-ever at this young age.I got my ears pierced when I was 12 years old and I made that decision on my own.|`|sUaF4MeBaa	im not trying to be rude but imagine me taking you and holding you down - while you have NO idea what is going on. then have some teenage girl pierce a piece of metal through a part of your body that you cant see the yell at you not to touch it? just think about it.... wait until she decides . and if you think that life is such a fashion show that you mush accessorize your baby then please take her to the doc and have him do it |`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Well I got my daughter's ears pierced when she was 3 1/2 months old. The experience in itself wasn't bad, you just have to make sure you are going to a certified jeweler. Also make sure they are using pure gold. As far as cleaning, it isn't a hassle. All you're basically doing is spinning the ball around and wiping with alcohol or petroxide. Now as far as the allergies, I'm not too sure if she would be affected as well.    Good Luck    xx    Edit- Wow it's insane people will give you a thumbs down just because they don't agree with the choices you made. If you don't/didn't get your daughter's ears pierced at a young age, That's great! There is no reward for it if you disapprove. Some people just need to grow up and realize not everyone share's the same views.    Edit- You are welcome! (:|`|wBpennsMaa	I will let my daughter get her ears pierced when she is old enough to come to me and ask because she wants them done herself. Who am I to decide for her whether she wants holes in her ears or not. |`|IKfzh78Daa	I'm personally not going to get my Daughter's ears pierced until she's old enough to ask for them. I don't want to risk her pulling on them, them getting infected, etc.    Just think about having to clean them all of the time, how you would deal with a fussy baby - if they get infected. It's up to you though.    I don't think you two being allergic will increase her odds, but you never know.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	i want to wait to get my daughters ear pierced when shes older and can ask for it... itll make a great surprise for a birthday present or for doing something really good.. my mom did that for me and sis and it was so awesome when we finally were allowed.. ill never forget that experience.|`|AA10804824	It's not that big of a deal to wait.

MaVs6Gd8aa	When you stop taking the pill, it throws off your body's menstrual cycle. So it is actually normal for your period to be late when you stop taking the pill. It can take up to 3 months for your body to re-adjust itself so that you begin having periods normally. Also, you're obviously worrying that you might be pregnant, and stress can also cause your period to be late.    However, if you have had sex in the last month, then obviously there is a chance that you are pregnant. Stop making yourself crazy with worry and just go buy a pregnancy test. And you really shouldn't be off the pill if you are having sex, because you will worry yourself sick about whether or not you are pregnant.|`|XNJBHikHaa	Yes it could be..  I went off the pill once and didn't get my period for 6 months.  Mostly due to stressing about not getting it that my body didn't let it happen.. Maybe you should go see your GP if you think you may be pregnant.|`|n9mLJ9Jqaa	Your body has to adjust to not having the pill interfere with your cycle. I would not be concerned at this time, it is early days. Your period is delayed that happens after stress, stop the pill or just comes late.  If you do not get your period does not start again by next month then I would be worried. If you have not had sex with a man then I would not be worried at all.  Periods become irregular as you get older and have more stress in your life.|`|hq4qedV9aa	go to the doc and get blood test done|`|jsUtix91aa	One good sign for me when I first got pregnant is that my breast were really sore as if someone used them for punching bags.

She should not take Afrin or any other nose spray without talking to her doctor because there is no telling what chemicals it contains or could be harmful. (If possible check the ingredients on the box and google it to be sure that it is in FDA pregnancy safe category A or B. If it is in category C or more then she should avoid it.)     Your daughter should have a humidifier in her bedroom to use at night. (She will also need the humidifier in the future for the baby's room so may as well go ahead and invest in one.) This will help prevent conjestion. Saline drops are good to flush out the mucous because when it builds up it can create an infection. She should stay wrapped up in blankets or a heavy sweater to prevent her from catching a draft. A warm shower will also help to open the head and when she gets out of the bath she should cover her head with a warm towel as well. Rest, lots of water, regular pre-natal vitamins, and lots of chicken soup will help her feel better. But she should avoid medicine at this point unless a doctor feels it is absolutely necessary.|`|5583876eeb9268c604b35749f6e9e15aaa	I highly doubt it.

72b5ba9301f4c317cf99e7c8f9cab4d4aa	Hi, im sorry to here this. it must be very confusing for you, I suffered a d miscarriage but i was 18 weeks when the baby died and i had no idea because i wasn't bleeding or anything. the best thing you can do is talk everything through with your midwife. maybe you'd feel more comfortable waiting a little while longer to see if anything else happens. you'd really have to talk to your health professional as everyone is different and i don't know all your circumstances. what ever happens good or bad it's natures way. it's either meant to be or not meant to be, so dont blame yourself for anything ok .|`|AA11529745	when the miscarriage happens go to the hospital. then wait a few weeks and try again. you will get your baby one day. the reason that this happens ( miscarriage ) is because the baby was not forming right. you have a right to be sad but you should try again. good luck.|`|4fdf000ae3a064d9cc0e98e426d1321baa	Please allow them to remove the fetus. If it does not have a heartbeat,  then you are in essence, housing a dead mass. Your body will begin to reject it and you will become ill and maybe even die from infection.    Please let them remove it and try again.|`|5d7920d3e17505ecdb36ba0dd41e3d02aa	this same thing happened to me and i waited just like you but it made it worst for me emtionally and pshcially i got relly sick and almost died this baby is not alive and you have to accept this you really need to talk to someone and get some help it's hard alone and it will make you severly depressed.|`|1ed7337a085e1d24b31ea80fb7255bb7aa	Go see another Gyno, get a second opinion.|`|eb8df000eded28b5f45277ee569be1f8aa	A miscarriage can take a long time to expel itself and the longer you wait, the greater the risk of infection and fertility problems as a result.     After 3 scans in three weeks, you really have to accept the reality that there is no baby.     I am terribly sorry you have to go through this, but the sooner you get your body back, the sooner you can recover and try again.     If it helps, having a miscarriage before the 8th week is very common. In fact, up to 20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage and it does not mean you are not capable of having a healthy baby. I have had 2 miscarriages and have had 2 healthy babies.     Keep taking your prenatal vitamins to keep your system healthy and ensure that you keep taking them as you try to conceive the next baby. It helps prevent birth defects and keeps you on an even keel.|`|c2a3c1e5740e0533dfe11911c2440895aa	If it is a miscarriage either let them take it out or go ahead and wait but not after the 18th if this is what it is then please except and don't try to hold onto to something that isn't meant to be you can always try again but don't make yourself sick worrying over this it will be OK trust and believe it will happen for you again|`|AA10139464	I feel for you.  This happened to my daughters dad and his girlfriend.  She was also about two months pregnant and they couldn't find a heart beat.  They called it a ' Missed Miscarriage".  She had absolutely no symptoms, or bleeding either.  They went for a sceduled ultrasound, and that was when it was discovered that she had lost the baby.    You have to go for the scan on the 18th, if you haven't passed the embryo by then.  You cannot just leave it, you can get very sick and may even lessen your chances of getting pregnant again.    I know you're hurting inside, I had a miscarriage with my first pregnancy.  I didn't know that I weas pregnant until I starting gushing blood.  The plus side to it, I have three beautiful children and I am pregnant for  4.  You will get pregnant again, and you will have healthy children.  Not to be insensitive - but a lot of the time, your body will miscarry if there is a problem with the baby.

Y1EAC33iaa	Leggilo  un bel libro,risale agli anni settanta e parla dell'aborto visto dal punto di vista del feto e della difficile decisione che le donne devono prendere in alcuni casi, tratto dall'esperienza personale di Oriana Fallacci autrice del libro.    Ciao un bacio|`|2fb1e75b477dafc561c12bcfbaf78dc9aa	"lettera a un bambino mai nato"   di oriana fallaci.   un libro magnifico, mi ha davvero colpita.   corto, sottile, si legge in poco tempo ma ti rimane dentro per tutta la vita.

EfUiKpSxaa	read him books. there are tons on the subject. also give him real consequences for bad behavior. at home and at school. I'm not saying you dont. I am not making any negative assumptions. My kids are spoiled as well. But better to fix the problem now than later. More to the point..... as tiring as a poorly behaved preschool age child is, imagine 10 years from now. They walk on your toes when they are small, but they walk on your heart when they're big.|`|4ae3caeeb07dac41fd30b07000a4c7b3aa	You are the parent.  You are in control.  If he is spoiled then you've spoiled him.  If you've tried everything--it's time to try harder.  Not to be blunt but it's that simple.    You need to get him to behave correctly.  Screaming and crying until he gets his way isn't the right way.  Next time he throws a fit discipline him and don't give in.  What have you tried?  Have you let him throw the entire fit until he's calmed himself down or do you give in half way?  Do you try to reason with him over and over until he gets his way?  I don't know what you have tried but the first step is not to bribe him [if you behave you'll get ____] or give in.  Next time he gets upset because you won't let him do something put him in a safe corner and let him cry and cry until he realizes he's not going to get whatever he wants.  I know it's hard to see our children cry but it's important that he learns what's unacceptable.    Engage him in activities.  There are many pre-school books out there that you can borrow from the library with lots of ideas.  Another thing that helps kids behave better is playing outside.  This lets them run wild and wears them down for the things that really matter.  Try painting with him.  Sing songs together.      Don't loose your temper.  That's hard for me at times.  It's important that parents set a good example.  If he asks for something that you don't want to give him explain why he can't have it and move on.      I know it's going to be a hard summer preparing him for kindergarten but I'm positive with will-power you can do it!  Just keep your cool, stay in control, and keep him occupied!  Good Luck!!!|`|ULC7xAvGaa	Well i'm not a parent but i do deal with kids, im 13. First off when you tell him to do something and he doesnt do it or gets angry or cries take something away. Ex. Cookies, t.v or videogames,etc. If he continues acting up, give him a timeout, put him in a locked room and leave him there for 5 minutes. If still acting up tell him to stop it, do not hit him or the aggresion will get worse. Plus when talking to him dont stand up and yell, crouch down to his height and talk to him slowly, tell him why he is punished or introuble and what he can do to stop it and tell him the consecuences he will get if he doesnt listen. Just be careful.|`|JDFEhZoeaa	Before all of my kids started school, I went to Walmart and bought some workbooks for them.  They are near the reading books in the toy dept.  I had my kids sit down every day and practice their shapes, colors and letters.  They also have some with computer games in them so the kids can learn to use a mouse.  If he gets used to sitting and working on things now then he will already be used to it when he goes to school.  I also try to do an art project with them and take them on nature walks to explore.  I have 2 in school and 1 ready to go next year.  Yesterday we took a walk down the stream near our house and found wood chewed by beavers and apple blossoms that will turn into apples.  It is good to have that hands on learning too.    A few days ago I got all 3 of my kids together with their little wagon and we went up and down our road (with rubber gloves) picking up the trash and finding bottles to donate to their school.  It is also a good idea to teach them about taking care of the environment and giving to other people, not expecting anything in return!  It teaches respect & empathy.|`|4122d642ae061ffbc01160f3b91c7fa9aa	Make sure he knows his ABC's, numbers, how to count, small words, colors, shapes, spelling of his first and last name, writing his name, where he lives, his phone  , Mother or and fathers name. Small and big, near and far, hot and cold, and the biggest is how to sit for along time lol.

It is only natural to be scared of being pregnant and going through labor, everyone pregnant woman worries about that sometime or another, even if they are all excited. There is many different ways to handle the pain, even if you think you can't, you CAN! Many, many, other women has done it before. Also, you can have an epidural or pain meds while in labor which help, but I honestly think it is better natural and that is what I plan on doing. I have always heard people talking and saying it is the worse pain there is and people are crazy for doing it natural, but there is ways to help yourself tolerate the pain. I found a website called www.babyzone.com that really helped me and I know I can do it. Which, I had already planned on keeping the baby anyway. Don't worry about it so much, and don't get rid of the baby because you are worried about the pain and there is other stuff you need to worry about too. Good Luck and I hope you make the right decision ;)|`|95TQYETXaa	if i can do it you can.. i am 16 and plan on keeping it and having natural birth  congrats|`|muD7o37iaa	weather or not you want to accept it, this baby is a part of your life now.  i know im young, and WAY to young to have a baby, so i cant say i know what you're going through.  i can say, however, that in the future the pain, suffering and emotions will be worth it because think about it: you get a priceless, wonderful baby out of the deal.    keep the baby.  you will love him/her forever.  you are so lucky - the father wants to be a part of the baby's life!  you are extremely blessed for that.    don't let people scare you. of course it will hurt - but many things hurt too.  abortion would be extremely painful, too, and you need to decide weather or not you are willing to take the life from the baby.    birth does seem like a scary concept - with all the labor and stuff.  i can completely understand your scared, and i would be too.  but, after a few minutes of pain, you'll be looking at a healthy little baby who needs and wants you for everything in this world.    isn't that what counts?  do whats right for you. best of luck!  you and your baby are in my prayers.|`|M8E8JKC5aa	if you think u will have a strong relation ship with the father...|`|aWU6YCH3aa	Its not as bad as it seems I got pregnant at 18 and gave birth at 19, you can always ask for an epidural, it will numb you waist down so you cant feel anything, it will be fine, dont kill your child just because you think you cant handle the pain, you can.|`|MjQ6vBmAaa	Im 18 and pregnant (were married). Im scared of the birth pain too, my mom said once the baby come out the pain just vanishes.  And the contractions, she said  You'll make it :)|`|Ev1R0iWwaa	giving birth is the easy part.  Raising the child is what you need to be more worried about.     You are an adult and you can make your own decisions.  If you choose to keep it, you can, if you choose to abort, you can as well.     but dont let giving birth be the thing to sway you one side or the other.  Pregnancy and child birth are the easy parts,  what you need to be asking your self is  are you ready to commit to raising a child for the next 18 years and on?     hope that helps, and good luck to which ever decision you choose.|`|cHW0ybYSaa	Well Darlin  I have heard that it is painful but i think that your happiness of having a beautiful child will surpass any fears that you have about the pain.  Also you can get medicine and it is normal to be afaird.    -Jenny|`|9VxCDDOVaa	dont worry about the pain it will be worth it |`|eSgt0h2eaa	Whether you keep the baby or not (abortion, or even adoption is a good choice if you don't want to "kill" the child but can't raise it... I don't agree with abortion personally, but that is your choice and none of my business! My opinion, though: adoption.) is entirely up to you and the father. You will decide what is best for that child, and you will make the right decision in the end.  Giving birth is painful, I won't lie. But it is so worth it. There are ways to reduce the pain (you could ask for an epidural, for example, to help control the pain). I, personally, gave birth without one. It hurt, oh boy did it hurt. I tore... down there... needed stitches...but it was still the best day of my life so far. You forget about the pain once you get your little boy/girl in your arms, anyway.    Good luck with everything. It will all work out the way it should... for the best.. whatever you decide.|`|1zpvzrRdaa	I wouldn't base you decision of whether or not to have an abortion on the fact that child birth hurts. I myself am pregnant with my first and am terrified of giving birth but with all the stories you hear of how painful it is, they all end with how worth it the pain was once your eyes settle on your little baby. You have a supportive boyfriend, who seems to want to have this baby and you need to keep that in mind, that baby is part of him too.   I myself could never even bring myself to consider abortion, but everyone has their own point of view on the matter. Just remember that if you do, you will probably always wonder what if you had kept it.   Best of luck to you.|`|JdJpViIIaa	Sorry but you had sex now your pregnant and you are "unsure wether or not you should keep the baby"? That is a little selfish don't ya think? Because YOU can't handle pain very well you are going to just not have YOUR baby.    Epidurals help tremendously... so I hear. My baby came too fast for it to even take effect.    Good Luck (:|`|kSB6AnCYaa	I think, that you should have the baby. A baby is a wonderful blessing and i know that you will be happy. I don't have any children of my own, but im sure that, yes, you will feel some slight discomfort, but then you will get to spend the rest of your life, with a beautiful child. I think it seems pretty worth it.   |`|YwmjvLGjaa	I had my baby when I was 18. The problem wasn't the labor because the doctor could give you pain medicine. Just pray and let God Handle everything. It's a wonderful experience that you will never forget. It's a good thing you have a Supportive boyfriend, appreciate that because most women don't and that is the part to worry about.    Good Luck God Bless|`|ByUS0k8waa	Its pretty bad but that's why they make pain meds. Im for having a child if you can afford it and think you are mature enough to raise the child. It will either make or break your relationship. Good luck!|`|Z3GkUTzCaa	I am super pro-choice but I really think you should go ahead and have the baby. The pain will be nothing compared to having the baby and if you're worried, get an epidural. The pain of that will only last a few seconds and it will make birth much easier for you! If you don't think you can support a child, give it up for adoption. There are many, many women who would love to have kids but just can't for whatever reason. These days, if you work hard and have a good head on your shoulders, you can raise a happy, healthy child and remain successful at any age!    GOOD LUCK!!!|`|3sIoLMsVaa	All your worried about is a few minutes of pain? What about taking care of the child? What about being a mother? Those are the things you should be worried about.|`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	I think that if you are having doubts that you shouldn't do it. The pain can be controlled. Your feelings or regret and emptiness can't. Go with what your heart is telling you!|`|UtvBfdR3aa	Abortion hurts too.  The baby is scraped out of you and you are never emotionally the same again.  If you don't think you are ready to be a mom consider adoption- there are tons of families who desperately want a child but may not be able to have one of their own.

lmESBQb7aa	Do not listen to the other answers. They are rude. If I were you, I would visit the local doctors clinic and ask them. They should be able to forward you to the right place. I do not live in New Jersey, so I personally have no idea, but the clinic should be able to help you!|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	If you weren't whoring around you'd know who the father of your child was.  Way to go.
srJNVxS6aa	Its really hard to know when to test when your periods are irregular,  you could have ovulated very late in your cycle, and are testing too early maybe.  Have you tried a blood test at your doctors?  They are much more sensitive than the at home tests.  Also, i was looking at some of the positives at peeonastick.com, and they turn out really really light, like barely even noticeable sometimes.  You could be diluting your urine, make sure you dont drink alot before bed, pee before bed, then test in the morning.    I would say to keep buying even the dollar store tests and keep trying!|`|H8dR3dqaaa	I myself have had irregular cycles. With my first and only pregnancy, I just "knew" it before my cycle. I understand it may be a bit confusing, but all of the sudden it came together. When I made myself take a pregnancy test (not expecting it to be positive after waiting and trying to avoid tinkering with the idea) it was! Surprise!! I had the "glow" and a dream and felt my angels were telling me something. Call it what you will, but like anything, everyones experiences are different. I didn't want to think or believe I could be because of past experiences. I also remember one morning waking up w/ a different fatigue (I know my own body) and I had to eat as soon as I could. My sugar shot low. My mood was also a bit lighter/sunnier. Other symptoms were just tender breasts, different twinges in abdomen. Hope this gives you some help. Bless!|`|vk1fzLGiaa	With my first child I just knew I was pregnant before I missed AF.  The only sign I had was sore breast, the rest was just gut feeling, and we where not trying just one day said I think I am.    I am currently waiting 3 more days to see if we are pregnant with number 2 (planned) I have many signs and hope they are not wishful thinking signs.    It is so hard to tell sometimes if you are getting false BFN's when you are so late.  If these are HT that are coming back BFN and you feel you are the best thing would be to make an appointment with your doctor.  Somethings can cause your body to think it is pregnant giving you all the sings but no baby.    Some doctors will do a blood test which is more accurate.  Best of luck to you.
AAbGMKo5aa	If u had unprotected sex them u have spermeis inside of u lol    I hope u learnd ur lesson and have protected sex next time..|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Well, if you miss your next period and the pregnancy test turns up positive then I guess you did.|`|QKGuNLb4aa	i would suggest that you take contraceptives of some sort other than just using condoms. there is a pretty good chance that if it tore you got some in you. good luck|`|wLzR4lIHaa	You would pry know and could tell that you had some in you. You would have felt different... like wetter ya know. You should be okay... but having sex with or without a condom puts you at risk for pregnancy and STD's.... just keep that in mind:)    Just wait a couple weeks and take a pregnancy test... if you still feel uneasy at that time.|`|dHFBKR2xaa	I'm sorry but if it's that bad thats why god made abortion butwith the sperm thing did you see him ejaculate and if you went all out anal wich I pray you didn't the condom might have came off and he might have gotten a little seamen in your vagina what position did you do any way that really has an effect on what might have happened to the condom you might whant to think about that and if you did not whant children why would you have sex|`|tsRhqi0Daa	same thing happened to me, i got preg tho & i just had my baby.
AfSwDFRcaa	Those are two signs of pregnancy but it you had a normal period, although it was 5 days early it couldn't be a pregnancy...  Figure out when your ovulating and work around that. good luck ttc
kaqPSgTVaa	If it was amniotic fluid it would be really goopy and you would be able to tell the different. As long as the fluid is watery and clear it's most likely just natural secretions. You really only need to worry if it's thick and yellow, green, or pinkish and smells bad. Call your doctor if you are still concerned but it doesn't sound like anything bad to me. I actually get this a lot as well.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	If you were going into labor you would feel it!!! I already get real contractions and is on bed rest ( only 26 weeks )   I also get damp but it's normal, always ask your doctor these questions, or call the nurse if you cant reach her. My doctor told me to only worry if I put a pad on and it got soaked, which hasn't been my case just a little wetness here and there. As long as the fluid is watery and clear it's most likely just natural secretion!!!!|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	i just read this yesterday on 3dpregnancy.com:    You may experience a little milky discharge "down there" this weekit's nothing to worry about. As your pregnancy continues, you can expect more of this leucorrhea (that's the technical term for it).    (of course it could also be urine leak from bladder pressure. The doctor can use litmus paper to test and see if it's amniotic fluid. But it likely is not since you've had it for a while. And some people's water breaks and they don't naturally go into labor at all and need induction drugs. with my 2nd, i wasn't in labor and they broke my water and I had a baby 2 hrs later.)|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	GROSS WHY CAN'T THEY STICK THESE QUESTIONS IN THE BACK SO I DON'T HAVE TO SEE THIS NASSSTYYYY STUFFFFF!!!!!!11!!111|`|rUQAGz9kaa	the amount of discharge you have increases when your pregnant ,to get rid of more bacteria .Thats probly all it is.
7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	they make Mucinex for children and it is great. My son has asthma and we use Robitussin CF with and expectorant. If it sounds as though is is wheezing when he coughs or the cough is coming from his toes (really deep hard cough) try bundling him and sitting outside for a while. The cool night air will open his airways. You can also (if you are comfortable) give him warm caffeine. The heat helps thin the mucus and the caffeine opens the bronchial tubes.|`|GOSfZN0qaa	If he just recovered from pneumonia and bronchitis, he needs to be checked again. He may need another round of antibiotics. Take him to a different Pediatrician or an after hours clinic if available. If not, go to ER.    You can also give him a pediatric medicine that will loosen and thin the mucus and phlegm. Ask your local pharmacist what they would recommend.|`|Hdn5NqzJaa	Take him to a doctor. (well a new doctor) Hope he feels better|`|s8P8C92zaa	My son, (also named Cole!), has had the croup hundreds of times, what really worked awesome is called, "old indian wild cherry bark syrup" You have to go to a health food store to find it.

F6lZHRkVaa	I was playing some of those baby einstein shows to my 6-month old until I read an article saying that they're detrimental to the development of a child under the age 2. So I'm shelving the videos for now and focusing on teaching him myself.    The only sign we do is the one for 'bottle.' We make the sign like we're milking a cow, and do it every single time we give him a bottle. He'll probably be talking before he picks that up.|`|GqEAun7Baa	Well I am not a mother but my aunt has a daughter that watched Baby Einstein and later proceeded to cut her own hair (she's six now) break a priceless china doll given to her by her biological mother. =)|`|3ME7sBxjaa	Why show them those things when they've been shown to have the opposite effect of what they claim?  They make the little ones less likely to learn.  It sounds like you already know that.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	LOL tv isn't the devil. But at that age their attention span might not be what it needs to be to really get anything from it. However I don't think it would hurt.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	My kids have a bunch of those Baby Einstein DVDs and love them. My youngest was 2 when he first saw it and yes he definitely picked up on it. We had already been using some basic signs like "hungry" & "drink" so he was really tickled to see other kids using it and to learn more. Baby Mozart saved my sanity when my firstborn was inconsolable. Nothing I did quieted him so in desperation I plopped him down in his bouncy seat and turned it on; instant quiet! They were wonderful for letting me get some housework done and I enjoyed the music as well.|`|bd3d8e1920d596e5bd7fe432bdd8c312aa	Try Galloping Minds DVDs - They have Alphabet, Phonics, Numbers, Animals, Spanish and a few more. They also have age appropriate Flash Cards. I used these for my kids - they quite enjoyed them!    Here's the website: http://www.gallopingminds.com    Heres a discounted website:    http://www.gallopingminds.com/shop_disco...|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I haven't.  I thought about it, but I figured I could teach my daughter her own signs.  She is 7 months old and just by watching her and paying close attention, I know what she needs or wants.  It seems like by the time we're supposed to start showing those DVDs, they can start communicating on their own.
Bu6eSZSlaa	Have you asked her? and if she did fell inlove with someone else why then would she come back to you.

0FXVTZf7aa	I'm against Sex Education being a Federal issue, I think it's a matter for the local School Board.  Having said that, if Sex Ed is to be taught at school then teaching "Abstinence Only" is the worst of all possible choices.  Teaching the kids about sex, then telling them things like condoms don't work is a outright public health nightmare, and I find it difficult the the medical community hasn't become completely unglued over the issue.|`|5tqh0akYaa	i believe in it and waiting for real love. I think its smart because honestly get with the times. we might as well teach protection in schools. too many people are having sex at younger and younger ages, but we cant control might as well prevent pregnancy.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I think my mother's approach was good: she told us not to have sex but that if we were going to, to not be stupid. I think sex ed. classes are good since teenage pregnancies are at an all-time low since they have been implemented. Since some youngsters still think that the pull-out method is an acceptable method of birth control, I think they are necessary.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I believe in it.   Sex is an adult decision with consequences that are sometimes easier on an adult.   No, sex ed is important. Although I do not recall having it myself.   I got pregnant at a young age. Lack of knowledge?  What else you got?    Teenagers fall in love a lot. Sex with every person you think you love? Not a good decision. Babies and sexually transmitted diseases are not something that is washed away.    Most condoms are put on wrong. Did you know that?  As for being abused, perhaps it will give one the strength to speak...    Wow....A lot of these answers rock. I wish I had something like this when I was younger.    Did you know doctors recommend sexual education should be taught at 8 and 9 years of age? Because people are having sex sooner, getting their periods sooner, contracting STDs earlier and getting pregnant sooner. (that can be dangerous to both mother and child.)|`|LTWlBSFNaa	i belive that if ur in love u shouldnt have to wait till ur married  i think it should be tought in school who want to talk bout it with there parents it would be funny in school|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Yes|`|ynAXDyQDaa	I believe in not being a ****.  Damn, just keep it in your pants until you're ready for it!|`|gG8oyymiaa	How did you go to abstinence to bath. I wasn't married when I had sex I still ain't. But you know what I don't think there is nothing wrong with people trying to teach abstinence. I think it should be encouraged. I also believe that sex education should be taught better. Alot of young girls that get pregnant never really got a chance to learn about it. Its a fact that they are still going to do what they want. But at least teach them how to protect themselves.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I believe in waiting until you are in a mature relationship and able to handle the possible consequences, but I don't believe in waiting until marriage. To me it doesn't matter if a ceremony has been performed or not if you're mature and able to handle the consquences. I think sex should be taught in school, because MANY parents do not talk to their kids about it. I don't think school teaches it well enough though, because many schools teach abstience only...which I think it's good to teach abstinence, but I think they also need to teach kids about how to be safe IF they chose not to abstain. So many people don't learn in school or from their parents and that makes for a bad situation.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	How could abstinence be wrong?    I believe sex education is important for children but also think a parent has the right to opt out of it for their child if they are willing to teach them it at home. Either way it should be a part of a required curriculum and the children should be tested so they know what they need to know but who teaches it should be the parents decision.|`|drI1vsJdaa	I'm personally waiting till marriage, but my sister is engaged, and well off with 3 kids. She has twin boys who are 17 months old, and a little girl who is 4 months old.    Yes I do. Teenagers will have sex, so you might as well tell them about safe sex, and the consequences of it.    As long as you can afford a baby, I think sex is okay.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If more parents took responsibility to teach their kids about sex, the schools wouldn't have to.  Too many think if they don't tell their kids about sex, they won't do it!|`|c61c4f44c63edf2ae9007329580c8a0faa	Being a Pastor I have to answer this, I would be negligent if I didn't.  I believe  God intended that a man and woman come together in the bonds of Holy Matrimony for the purpose of bringing forth new life.  I believe the Bible is clear on keeping one for his wife, or husband and it's clear about other issues such as homosexual marriage and such.  I believe parents should teach their sons and daughters what and when sex is for, but I also believe if churches also gave a clearer picture of what sex is intended for.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	yes i believe in adstinence im 19 still a virgin still a good girl but i guess sex ed classes are kinda good in a way u have to learn bout sex some kind of way|`|TTpMYhrUaa	abstinence, yes. sex ed in school- i think they should teach more of it.|`|WLwnOePMaa	I'm 100% FOR abstinence ^ ^ so many less problems when you don't have to worry about if you're pregnant or if you have STI's.   I'm only 16, I shouldn't have to worry about that. I don't want to worry about that until I have a husband I can lean on with my problems. Not just a boyfriend.   But I do still believe they should be teaching About sex. Not how to do it or anything, just the dangers and risks. I'm pretty sure if I wasn't fully informed on sex I probably would do it.
8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	Not at all. I think it only encourages teen sex. If you think you are old enough and mature enough for sex then get your own money and pay for your own condoms.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Ha, I don't think they should either.    If you can't even afford to buy condoms yourself, how are you going to afford a pregnancy if it were to happen?  I think if you're not even old enough to get a job, you're too young to have sex.  And giving condoms out at middle school is horrible, because 11 and 12 year olds can get them and that just sets them up for becoming $lut$.|`|LTWlBSFNaa	i think they should if u dont want to go buy one cause the people at the gas station or w/e|`|QGkBZFqWaa	No they shouldn't.  If people are responsible enough to have sex they should buy their own condoms.    If Paris Hilton was president that would be the norm.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	DITTO!!|`|MIUzgwsTaa	I agree with you   but with my own personal reason  I think that giving out condoms would promote sex  instead of abstinence  but i guess they are trying to promote "safe sex" instead|`|e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	If your mature enough and responsible, people should be able to get it yourself.    At school its like saying, take a condom, because its okay to have sex! because condoms don't wory 100% of the time~ so if you get pregnant. its okay! we gave you a condom!|`|VgQy2haaaa	I completely agree.  If you are mature enough to have sex you better be mature enough to have a job to pay for the condoms and the possible baby!|`|vAiklYCYaa	they shouldn't  i mean seriously|`|IwvOKjfcaa	I agree!  There is no way that my school will ever give out free condoms. But part of that is probably because my school is Catholic and sex before marriage is a sin haha.|`|c61c4f44c63edf2ae9007329580c8a0faa	I agree with you as well.  Middle School students have no business having sex as it could mess up their education and not many jobs for a middle school drop out.  It's hard enough for a High School drop out but I would say when they are old enough and mature enough to handle the responsibility of having sex and the risks involved then they should be able to buy their own condoms and put them on properly.|`|C3WlLuYoaa	Yes in a perfect world everyone that has sex could afford condoms..but let's get real, everybody cannot.  Would you rather more girls have babies they cannot care for, or more young teens get STD's? Yes, I would rather them not have sex at all, but it's their choice, so at least they are being safe.|`|uQyrxxmIaa	I dnt think its the fact of being mature, i jst think that its a schools way of protecting the nxt generation.|`|clFTA9fDaa	think of it this way...  If a kid is set on having sex, they're going to. Teaching them abstinence won't stop them. And I personally think it's really irresponsible to just teach teens not do to it. Because it's obvious they do. It'd be smarter to encourage them to wait, but if they aren't going to, teach them how to be safe about it. Of course in a perfect world only people old enough to buy condoms would have sex, but that's not reality. The school nurse is just preventing pregnant 16 year olds walking around or a bunch of teens with herpes.|`|dqZ2eglPaa	I strongly believe that by providing teenagers with the contraceptives, they are more likely to use them. To be honest, teens will have sex if they see it as something rebellious, and something that they will have to wait for (think about drinking. If kids grow up thinking this is a taboo thing, and it isn't talked about in their home, there is a good chance that they will go out and get drunk underage, in a dangerous situation). If the teens are provided with some means of contraceptive and sexual education, than they will learn of their options, and they will be safer when they choose to become sexually active. By providing condoms at school, I think that the general sexual awareness and health will improve.    EDIT: I should specify that I don't believe that middle schools should be providing condoms, but should be teaching proper, truthful sexual education. The children who are in middle school should not be having sex, but I think that they should learn how to be healthy and safe, so that one day, when the time comes, there won't be any second thoughts in their minds.|`|AA10427916	I agree with you wholly in theory.  operative word: THEORY.  of course people who have sex should be mature. does that mean everyone who has sex is mature? absolutely not. we should be doing all we can to promote safe sex which will also lower the rate of STD's and teen pregnancies.   besides, some kids don't even have 2 dollars to buy their own condoms. should we just let them multiply like rabbits and catch STD's like baseball players catch balls.  there is a gaping chasm between what the world should be and what it is. if the world were perfect, there would be no hunger or poverty. Does that mean we should cut programs that help give underprivileged people jobs and end all efforts to help feed the hungry? obviously not. similarly, we should not stop promoting safe sex just because, in our minds and imaginations, it shouldn't be happening.|`|FlHqssPJaa	in a high school yes.
UOLnp1NOaa	it is possible that you can be pregnant. But the bloating in your stomach could be from a stomach bug ( you mentioned you had diareaha and felt sick) and the Stomach bug, could produce all of these, except the missed periods.  Good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	See a doctor and have a blood test done. It's unlikely if you have taken a pregnancy test recently for it to be wrong.|`|MXXOICquaa	there could be a number of reasons your period didnt come but to answer your question ive had multiple preg. test that were neg and i was pregnant its all in how much HCG your body produces go to your doctor they will probably do a blood test to check, good luck|`|mcIo0LQ4aa	If I were you, I would go see a doctor. He could give you a check and see if you're pregnant. People rely too much on today's technology and forget sometimes it fails. No biggie, just go see your doc. :)  Best of Wishes!        ?

alxuJVsCaa	Just letting you know that Counterstrike is a game. I haven't played that game in like 5 years.|`|2OFixxqgaa	you will have whats meant to be|`|ymdPniDYaa	I checked out that site.  It's just plain freaky!  Why are people so obsessive about baby gender?  And why do they think that complete strangers on the internet can help them if their doctor can't?  And besides all that, who CARES what gender it is because you can't do anything about it anyway!?  So disturbing.|`|Bge5zjJYaa	lol is this about counterstrike or something?|`|ukaKaCReaa	yes to the answer. No to the second part.
KICQQxLxaa	LOL...I am guessing power of suggestion!!!  I doubt one tiny taste made her hyper for hours.    Hopefully Sally will go to bed soon...just think, maybe she will sleep in for you tomorrow morning!!    Did she like the ice cream??|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well I have seen the effects in my niece of sugar on a kid that doesn't get it very often.  A piece of cake used to send her bouncing off the walls.  But I find it hard to believe that a bite of ice cream would do that.  I mean, compared to most sweets, ice cream doesn't even have that much sugar in it, you know?    At least she's not crying!|`|ZKHaLbdEaa	My babby pulls the same act, especially when I'm thinking "Oh, he's under the weather; he'll be sleepy tonight" and suddenly he SPRINGS into action.  It's like they save up all their energy from the day and unleash it all at once.  I doubt it was just the sugar.  I think it's a babby thing.  On nights like these, I dim the lights and put all the overly stimulating toys away and let him wind down 'til he gets real bored.|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	Lol, maybe she is just happy. My babbies always get hyper from having a bath and getting towel dried, they run around like little animals or babby camels. Give her more, maybe she could make it to midnight....party at your house. WOOT.|`|hR1EVzjIaa	Just give that babby more chocolate ice cream!  How could you tease her so bad?!  My 8 month-old just got done with her Chocolate Fudge Brownie.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Learned in class that the "sugar buzz" is a myth. There is not such thing...I'm thinking it's just a coincidence.    Good luck with that, lol.|`|rjVALevtaa	Actually, it has been proven that sugar doesn't make children hyper. I don't know why you're daughter is being so active, maybe it's just a coincidence.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Hahaha, sugar rush! It should wear down soon, try to keep her calm.    What comes up, must come down, lol.|`|PWVYYh2Haa	probably just a coincidence. tiny bit of sugar isn't going to send her "crazy", unless daddy gave her more than just a tiny bite when you weren't in the room..lol.|`|7Jsibcnpaa	I think it's mostly in your head....a taste of chocolate ice cream never got my *** off the couch!!  LOL|`|yo3nk21Faa	Babbies are smart. Mine will get a surge of energy when she senses that we are tired. It's like she's saying "Oh yeah??? Well F you! You're not getting any relaxation!" while she bangs pots and pans and runs around naked.|`|43JgLpkKaa	she is just feeling better , and getting her energy back.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Sounds like my Boys.  We don't have a lot of sugar (only natural sugars) in their diets, and when they get some sugar, WOW.  My Grandfather gave them a sip of coke once (yeah yeah bag on me), and the 3yos were climbing off the walls at 1 am. Seriously it was unreal.    You could try making your own ice cream, we found it the best way to control their sugar addiction lol  They love frozen yoghurt's too.
WbJPQM1naa	wow!   Sorry you had such a rough day!   Did they arrest the guy who ran into you?   If so, he's probably having a worse night than you are!|`|xOr67VDiaa	sheesh poor guy|`|AA11537580	well  you where not at fault, the drunk driver has to pay all your bills with his insurance|`|7TRp1p94aa	At least you are all fine.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Ya sheesh you are a oor guy
GJ0IDpULaa	VERY MUCH YES! Your actually more fertile after giving birth than regular ovulation time.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Yeah, it's entirely possible. There have been women being told they are pregnant again at their 6 week postpartum checkup.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Of course you can because you ovulate before you start bleeding. That's how the cycle works.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Yes, there is always a possibility.|`|qxnZXOVFaa	yes!  you are your most fertile then!  use protection!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Yeah, a lot of women actually go to their 6-week check-up pregnant, so be very careful!|`|7EOLTC20aa	Yes you can!  My friend had her son in the middle of January and then in late December had her daughter...of the same year!!!|`|oB8bbiwWaa	yes, you might ovulate prior to your period returning so it is entirely possible.
syrh8J6Vaa	It depends on a lot of things.  It depends on the level of acidity in your body and many other factors.  Some studies have shown them to live up to 7 days.  So basically it can be anywhere from 3 - 7 days.|`|bSZK2tVtaa	I have heard that but i also was told that 50% of the sperm dies to. So i guess you just need one good luck charm huh? Loll Good luck sweety!    Sara-|`|uOp2sdiQaa	72 hours, so 3 days.|`|AA11185954	The fertile life of sperm is only 24-48 hours, but they have been found mobile after 85 hours after 'coitus' (sex).|`|U3JEHXy0aa	they say 3 days,well best of luck.
j9ta5ulqaa	I know you are probably dying to pee on that stick..so this probably won't matter..lol.. I'd wait until Monday or Tuesday. My sister-in-law used the clear blue 5 days before test..it was neg. 5 days early ..but it was positive on 3 days before..but I know myself would be buying one tonight..lol|`|9wHGr8Hraa	you should try a clear blue test that you can buy at a drug store..this test you can do up to 4 days before your missed period.|`|vzDmaWqaaa	You can start trying pregnancy tests around the Date your period is supposed to come.  If you are a regular person you should get a acurate reading about a week late.  But some women produce lower levels of HCG ( the chemical that the test is looking for that indicated pregnancy) so the test will not find enough to give you a positive reading on the test if you test to early.  The only conclusive answers come from a positive test or your period.  Wish there could be more to tell you but its a waiting game now.  Try to keep your sanity and think about something else for a week or so.  Good luck!|`|lhn1wNoeaa	wait till you miss your next period.
BQsVPV9Yaa	oh my gosh! haha! I am so sorry to laugh but I feel the SAME way!! I asked my doctor about it and she said it is completely normal and to be expected. Mine just started a week ago and I'm 38 weeks, so I'm very sorry for you that it already started! It just has gotten worse for me and I limp around and could almost cry when I walk! I wish I could tell you something that would help, but there is nothing!!   Good luck! It will be over eventually ;)|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	yeah, it's normal. and unfortunatly will only get worse as you approach labor more and more each day and week. it is miserable. that's why you see all these posts on here from ladies at 36-40 weeks saying 'NATURAL INDUCTION!' because we are just sick of the feeling. its miserable, i agree, it really is. but it will be worth it. try taking a couple tylenol or a couple benedryl to help you sleep. good luck. hope things ease up for you. some days will be worse than others.|`|2I5D78Sbaa	yes its suppose to feel like that, the baby is moving down..its normal.|`|X83LVP6Iaa	I feel your pain. I am 38 weeks with a big baby and the more she moves her head the more it makes me uncomfortable. I've been dealing with this Pelvic Girdle Pain/Discomfortable (thats what its called) for about 5 weeks now. Your dr. isn't concerened and neither is mine. That's because there is nothing they can do or you can do. You can look up Pelvic Girdle Discomfort to get more information if you'd like. Good luck to you and rest as much as you can. It helps with the pain and discomfort.|`|TycCeqtaaa	yeah you know something called the branxton kicks or branxton contractions are what cause it to hurt. its just your vagina getting your ready for the baby thats coming. its kinda like you feel the baby head grinding on your bones huh?   but dont worry just a little more and you'll be home free. lol. hopes this helps. good luck pushing out! thats the  tricky part. lol
s4LWmcTjaa	Honestly, neither.  But if I had to choose one or the other I'd say I'd rather find my kids drinking beer than injecting a lethal drug.    You can die from your first high on heroin.  Proven fact.      If I found my kids doing either one, I'd be kicking their butt (and probably in the literal sense).  Then we'd have a crash course on the dangers of drugs and alcohol all over again.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Now what parent would want to see their child shooting up or any kind of drug use?  Drinking is illegal for anyone under the age of 21.  If they're legal, then it's fine with me.|`|rjVALevtaa	I think most parents are going to agree that they would much rather find their child have a few beers than doing drugs.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	Ummm neither, why does it have to be one of those? I'd rather see him doing his homework, watching discovery channel eating an apple.     If I had to pick one obviously drinking a beer with friends, isn't that a no brainer? Who in their right mind would say they would rather see their son using heroin?|`|vI4QG8Gfaa	Deinitely drinking beers|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Oh yeah, because those two things are soooooo in the same league!    Umm, I'll take the beer.|`|0OERgH7taa	drinkng beers lol|`|DLVcmUidaa	NEITHER! ohh god if i ever find my son/daughter drinking or doing drugs OMG.  it will be world war 10 for them:)|`|EriaXXVWaa	Beer isn't as bad as heroin. Alcohol is good in moderation, heroin is not. It's more human too, wine is mentioned in the bible, heroin is not. (Yeah, I got that from a movie, can you name which one?) Heroin is much more addicting too.|`|y43tzOQlaa	Well being a sister of a heroin addict and a mother of teenagers give em the beer any day!|`|c0760cf2c0a3220464d859713e02da7aaa	Obviously I wouldnt want either but of course I would rather my kids drink beer than shoot up herion.
5pQeDxT8aa	Sorry to say it but yeah it is >.>|`|njjj4zljaa	wow this is so fake...|`|cnSew7jiaa	girl, you need to back up and leave those two alone. yeah you are a problem for them believe it or not. just go away and let those two be, let them each find a girl who loves them and only them, not both.|`|laLW1Krwaa	no they hate  each other because they just do  They don't hate each other because of you.    Ok now i read the whole thing  Why would you go out with your boyfriend brother eww  yup it was u who messed up their friendship|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	didnt you say in a previous question of yours something like this...? idk....i dont think that it is your fault i would hate my bro if he tried to do something like that. hope i helped =p    ~IloveT.S|`|14pjwQPLaa	You know, if a guy kept trying to "kill" me and tried to rape me, he'd be in jail for attempted murder and assault, not just out wandering around.  Sounds like you are enjoying the drama.
mqHL4UcRaa	Your stomach doesnt just get hard, your uterus grows upward. So once your uterus expands above your pelvic bone, you will start to notice it. I think I started to notice it around 12 weeks. Then your uterus just continues to expand upward & you will be able to trace it as it grows. For example, I'm 25 weeks. My uterus has expanded just an inch or two above my belly button. So my stomach is somewhat hard all the way up to my belly button.     And I started showing around 17 weeks. Hope this helps!|`|gG8oyymiaa	I was 5 months when It really started showing. 6 months now and I feel HUGE.|`|7ZTlktMeaa	Everyone is different. Depending on your size to start out w/, your height... everything. My belly didn't get hard until probably like the 4th or 5th month... @ first it's kinda like you're just getting fat. lol. That's how I felt anyway.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	everyone is different, I started showing at around week 14. Good Luck, and God Bless
p7ZdohGTaa	No matter when you actually became pregnant, you should take some good vitamins, especially since you already miscarried. Make sure, tomorrow, to get some folic acid which is very important in the very beginning for the baby. Then, you could look into going to the health food store to get some vitamins or ask your doctor. Try to eat high protein foods, like meats and eat lots of dark, leafy green vegetables. I know this is not an answer to your question, but it could be helpful to your little one. If you take a vitamin with iron in it, you should take it at a different time than your vitamin E containing vitamin, according to some sources.|`|7ZTlktMeaa	You could have def. been prego in Nov, if you had a positive test in Dec... Actually I would say that you were. It takes a few weeks from when you get pregnant to when it actually shows up on a pregnancy test!     YAY for you!! Congrats! Call your doctor!!|`|TycCeqtaaa	yeah you can be on your period for up to 3 months after your prego. an aunt of mine was like that. so go to a doctor soon. good luck im prego too!
7EOLTC20aa	Well, I don't really know much about him, but he sounds like the type of person you need right about now...caring, supportive, and understanding.  I would be a little hesitant on the whole 'being at the birth' thing...I mean, this isn't a family member or a fiance or even the father of the babys...I would wait to make that decision until later in the pregnancy.  See where this relationship goes and where you two are when it gets closer to the time of your due date.  What ever you decide, I am sure there in no reason to be in an abusive relationship...for your sake or the sake of your 2 babys.  Good luck with whatever you do!|`|IA5zVfk0aa	awwwwwww thats so sweet!!|`|FA710vETaa	keep him:)|`|la8W09sFaa	he is sweet, and i cannot belive there are still men out there like that anymore. keep focus and congrats on your twins!!!|`|8hwGmfs8aa	be careful he myt get to attached to the babies nd cause problems for you.......but yes it is real sweet i wish i had someone like tht my ex was controlling nd violent nd i am soooo glad to b rid of him :)|`|IEO6F3TZaa	Yea but make sure he does have good intentions.  He probably likes you more than you know or realize.  Don't fall all over yourself yet.  Pregnant women have sensitive hormones and sometimes they could the judgment.  Remember, if it seems to good to be true then it probably is.  Be Careful.|`|UOLnp1NOaa	Does he know it is twins?  if he knows it is twins and STILL wants to stay around, then he is a keeper  :)  or very innocent and doesnt realize what 2 babies mean....lol
k0QRfQ00aa	I wonder about the birth control myself. I was on it for about 4 years when I was in my twenties and now after being so fertile I have became so infertile. My husband was normal and I ovulate and have a AF every 28 days still nothing. But I do think it is true that birth control does messes you up in the long run.|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	it could be true or it could be just that nowdays its charted and recoreded and therfore more obvious. woman did suffer in the past.     there are a lot of factors that could be contributing to this...  the main one iv heard of is that woman tend to put careers first familys later on nowdays...meaning they spend all their young years working their butts off and then decide to have a family later on...the older you get the more chance u could have infertility problems...,the chance of conciveing goes down once you hit 30 and so on ....    another reason could be today women arnt very healthy..SOME...  there is so much fast food, obesity..can effect fertility..    smoking, drinking, partying can all effect it    ther has been no proof that b.c can effect fertility..but one day they may find out it does...    i think this needs to be studied more...becuase your right it does seem likie its getting more and more comman.
bZWbwyn4aa	Actually, I don't agree that gender is irrelevant.  I have a 16 year old step daughter and a 12 year old son.  I was the oldest in a family of 5 kids - I had 4 brothers.  I have friends with both boys and girls.  Girls are harder to deal with.      I am only generalising, but I think girls are more likely to rebel against discipline. They are different in so many ways, and at that age, a girl is usually more independent by natures, so this will contribute to her rebellion.  Boys are often quite happy to just keep the peace - they don't argue back in the same way a girl does.  They will just sulk, LOL. But sulking is easy to deal with, because you don't care if they go off and sulk in their room.  Its the screaming and yelling I can't handle.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	i don't believe that gender has anything to do with it.   It has to do with the individual child.  I have a teenage daughter now, and I had a teenage son, who is now 20-  and my daughter was always the easier of the two.  Then I know other parents who think their sons were easier.|`|hGmq5IuZaa	no why would it be? Gender doesnt come into it|`|FWlYX7tmaa	Depends how you raise them.|`|SLfRa7p1aa	it all depends!
62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	find out why they were expelled?   were they acting up?   were they always being the clas clown?   did they get good grades or are they struggling to keep up?   Are they acting up BECAUSE they are struggling?     Find out why they are struggling and get it remedied if at all possible. Maybe they have an undiagnosed learning disorder.  Maybe they are very smart and just BORED in class.     Hitting and yelling does not help. You will just create an angry resentful teenager who hates you even more.     Please TALK to them and ask questions and tell then that you GENUINELY  want to help.     BUT first you must apologise for any previous yelling or hitting you may have done. That will go a long way to getting  them talk to you.|`|xOr67VDiaa	send them to a boarding school!|`|EVpsVgokaa	Talk to them calmly ............That sounds like this kid named Edwin at my school same thing happend to him ...WEIRD!!!!!!!|`|jgimpZSpaa	show them its not about them and tell them to straighten up  if they never reacted to your harsh punishment maybe they never took you seriously  show them you mean it  dont chicken out  show them Jesus  he can smooth things out if you cant|`|AA11828121	Talking calmly is always the answer. Yelling only causes the teen and the parent to argue rather than have a conversation, it gets to the point where the teen feels not heard.     See if there are any alternative schools in your area, I went to one here. I wasn't expelled, I hated school and dropped out for a semester, I went to alternative night school and ended up graduating before my class and realized I didn't hate school, I was just bored because I learned more quickly.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Send him/her to military school. Problem solved. This child hasn't learned a lesson yet and thinks it's appropriate to behave inappropriately. Therefore, this child needs to go to a school which is suited to dealing with kids like your child. Your child could also benefit from therapy. I'd maybe also ask about alternative high schools for kids like your kid.|`|6MKAU8hBaa	beat the **** out of em. sounds like ure being too soft and your kid will never learn. start hitting the kid! they claim its illegal, but its really not when most parents do it. teach that kid who's boss|`|XZ63cQmhaa	whoop his or her azz|`|FQhlQss0aa	take away there car and any thing they like.|`|skWN7jWHaa	take every single thing away from him except his bed,clothes,and toothbrush dont let him eat the foods he likes neither ...see how he acts then|`|Fkga5HF8aa	beat there ***, yell at them, take their phone and/or car away until they straighten out. im in school and if that ever happened to be my mom would kill me also drug test them you never know|`|hGmq5IuZaa	suspended 2x ..the damage is done..you cant go back and fix all those yrs now|`|9KIxtlG8aa	Well it's your decision to make, your the one who knows how the teen will react the best. They can take it two ways: maturely discussion, or the "yelling" treatment. Maybe the teen finds school a hard, and  awkward place to be. It can be stressful for many students, some find it hard to interact with other students, they may find they don't fit in with the others in the school. I'd say you should calmly dig beyond the situation, talk to your child, see what's wrong. It may be a problem that can be easily resolved, people can feel a whole lot better getting something off their chests.|`|nqckdPflaa	Maybe theres something that's preoccupying the teen, that hes not telling you.  Could have something to do with grades? Family? Friends? Girl or boy ?  Talk to him/her calmly but still give him/her space.  They probably open up to you, admitting flaws is hard.  Thats why they need space.  And maybe they'll fix the problem on their own.  :)
DDYwnut6aa	If there are no sperm count issues, every day is fine.  It takes about 24 hours for the sperm to be replenished.  If there is a low sperm count, then every other day is recommended.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	A lot of my friends got pregnant that way.|`|8hYKIRWiaa	everyday is not recommended because the sperm count can be lowered.  sperm can live inside of you for a few days so if you miss a day and ovulate you can still conceive with the sperm already in you.  GOOD LUCK|`|PW3hcVZiaa	My doc said every other day and it worked for us the first month!  Good luck!|`|jpJ0SZBdaa	You should ovulate about 9 days after your last clomid pill.  If his sperm count is normal, BDing everyday is not a problem.  If the sperm count is low, BDing every other day is recommended.  Only because it takes about 24 hours for his sperm count to be high again.  If you are showing EWCM, start BDing tonight and for the next 2-3 days to cover yourself.  GL & HTH
q3rDROxgaa	http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/h...    hopefully that helps im 15 and dont know much but my mom leaves the door opned and a night liget for my siblings the 1st week there kinda not wanting to then they get used to it|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	We put my son in his room baby gated in and let him cry it out. I took about 3 maybe 4 nights of crying and he went to bed without problem after that.|`|f3970002b2dbc521cbdb5caf04d0830eaa	this worked on mine just let them fall asleep wherever then move them to there bed after awile they should get used to waking up in his own bed and willingly sleep there if that dont work try putting them in bed then staying in there till they fall asleep ( sing to them or play soft sounds if you want them to get to sleep faster) then leave that should after awhile work where you dont have to stay in there.|`|7Jsibcnpaa	Get him sheets and blankets of characters that's he's into(Carz, HotWheels, Sports, Nick Jr.) and make it a big deal!!  Explain to him that he can only sleep on his new sheets.  Make a bed time and read him a book....a night light always helps too.  I wish you the best of luck!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I agree with the poster who said get new sheets and make it a big deal... Thats what Im doing with my soon to be 18mth old. Hopefully it will work. Also there is a super-nanny technique of staying in the room and slowly creep to the door as the babe falls asleep, this may take about an hour of your time, but the baby eventually stays in bed knowing that you are there... GL!
PFO1jxZGaa	I think he is like a cat or something. My kids looove him. Even my 18 mos old sings along, wow wow, wow wow. its so funny :)|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Big Bird.|`|8uauS9aAaa	I'm not sure he is one...|`|FSZIzDsPaa	All I know is that he likes to play! play! play!|`|xzMkUCizaa	it's not an actual animal though it looks like a cat to me lol and yes my son LOVES this show.|`|d4BhvnMyaa	Heh, I looked this up on wikipedia a few months ago because it was driving me crazy.. He's "A male yellow gerbil-like creature."
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I was 3 cm for almost 2 weeks :)     I thought I was going to pregnant forever!    My story:    I had my membranes stripped at 38 and 39 weeks. The second time I was 39w4d and had it done at about 3:00. I had mild cramping and back for the rest of the day, no appetite and just felt off. I woke up at 4am and thought I had peed, I was so upset! I got up went to the bathroom and thought why do I have to pee so bad if I just peed myself? I had a contraction just after I got out of the bathroom and had another two minutes later (I decided I needed an epidural after the second contraction!). I woke my husband (who said "dammit woman! I have to get up in 2 hours for work! Leave me alone!") and we went to the hospital. Turns out my water had broken and I didn't pee my pants after all :)     I had my son about 12 hours later. A little more than 24 hours after getting my membranes stripped.    About the epidural:    I got one and it didn't work :( I felt ever contraction, I felt myself tear, and I felt every stitch. Turns out epidurals only work 85% of the time and you *can* make them re-do it if it doesn't work for you. I wish I would have known that!|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	My first sign with both of my daughter was diarrhea that would start about 2 days before.  My next thing with both was my mucus plug and well i had blood mixed in with my mucus.  With my first my water was breaking slowly i would feel pressure and i would sit in the toilet Fluid would just come out.  With my second my water broke i was already having contractions but they where still 10 minutes apart.  After my water broke my contractions just started. My water also broke during a contraction.  It felt like a balloon popped. I had both of my daughters, without a epidural and it was wonderful.  My first was 6hours and 22 minutes and the second 3 hours and 27 minutes.  I wish you luck and well it will hurt, sorry but it's all worth it.i had both of them at 37 weeks|`|k0QRfQ00aa	My first signs of labor was the contractions and the vomitting. It is called active labor. Contractions are probably the worse part of it all. I had a c-section the first time, second time my water broke, and the third time I had my water broken while I was throwing up! It was really not a great experience for me.     The best tip I can give you is not to panic, BREATHE! It is so very important and ask for the epidural...trust me you'd want that. But women do vary in pain when the time comes. Congratulations and the best of luck to you!!|`|4nAl9Y7Baa	Congratulations! I know how you are feeling right now, I just had my third daughter 7 weeks ago. My labors were all long but not painful  because of my epidural. I pushed for 20 minutes and they came out. What to look for is if you are leaking or gushing fluid or your stomach is getting hard (contracting) that's how I knew. I never had any diarrhea or anything like that. Sorry if I'm not much help. Good luck.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	well i had been cleaning all morning..i sat down to eat and after that i could not get comfortable and then felt very tired so i decided i would go and lie down on the bed and have a sleep but  before i went to bed i went toilet i finished wiped and then gush (lol) a whole lot of water i then called my partner and my mmidwife who told me to go to hospital and i got there at 5.30 pm was having contractions but couldnt feel them..at 12.30am i was in quite abit of pain and asked to be moved to the delivery suite where i was getting looked after alot i was only 3cm dilated i rung my partner to come back to the hospital at 3.30am (was in abit of pain but could manage) then at 7.30 my midiwfe came in and checked me i was only 4cm dilated then i was screaming the hospital down at 9.30am so she gave me pethadine(spelling) and put sydocene(spelling) in my drip then my contractions were very painful and coming all the time( barely felt like they were going away) midwife checked me again at 9.50 i was then still only 5cm then 10 mins later i said i had to push she checked me and i was 10cm ready to go and at 10.38 my 7lb13oz baby boy was here..!!yay..he is now 6 weeks old|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	I was induced with both. But here are mine.  They started my inducement at 7:30AM. I was 1CM and 25% effaced. Contractions didn't start until after my water was broken at around 8:00AM. I requested paid meds when I was 3CM dilated (regret it now), but only gas mask. When I was 6CM I got a drip for pain meds (I can't remember the name of the med) and got stuck for a few hours. My son also got stuck above my pubic bone. Once I moved he came down and things went alot quicker. When it was finally time to push I pushed for 45 minutes.  I regret my labour with my son. I didn't feel in touch with my body, and I didn't feel like it was our birth, I felt like it was the nurses birth.    With my daughter I was so much more prepared. When I went in I was 3CM dilated and 50% effaced. I got the the hospital at around 8:30AM and was started on everything. OB came in at 9:00AM to break my water (I was in the care of a midwife, but was transfered to OB care for the inducement). Contractions start after that. I did most of my labour squatted on the toilet. I had no complications, no paid meds, and did MY birth MY way, NOT the nurses way. After not about 2 hours I felt the urge to push. I told my mom and fiance, they got me to the bed and called the nurses. They came and checked me and INSISTED I was only 5CM and not ready. Well in 5 minute or less I went to 10CM. Pushed for maybe 5 minutes and she was here!|`|Iuy1eWyhaa	My water broke at around 630 am, I went to go pee as I always do and 'gush'! yeah, just like that! (OH, and the gushing doesn't stop either, if yours breaks, you will be wearing a towel in your pants!)   I was in labor 22 hours, It wasnt too bad, long and boring, i had an epidural half way through, and even though i was on pitocin my labor neer progressed. I waited and waited then at 4am the baby was having difficulty, so i had a c-section after all that waiting!  I had a wonderful little boy, and I had a wonderful experience - c section and all! He was 100% healthy, the only thing that was funny with him was that because he tried to come out the 'normal' way, but never did, his head was all stretched out, and he looked like a cone head!    I hope that you have a really good experience. Good nurses are vital! since i had a c section, i was in the hospital for 3 days, which i really really was glad, because the nurses were always there to help you, and the breastfeeding consultant would stop by and help too.    Oh, and the epidural aint bad. Once you get it, dont forget that you will be catheterized, and won't be able to walk around anymore. And don't get it too late or they might not even do it!!!!

Haydan Summer - not very fond of either....not bad, just don't love it...but they sound good together  Aili Starr (Aili means 'sweet' in german) - Aili is very nice, not fond of Starr  Myra Bean - it's ok  *suggestions?* April - Callista April - like April only for a middle name    Here are some more uncommon names that we considered (a few we used)....maybe they'll spark an idea. (I like your style of names...very few I didn't like)        Girls -  Salem Kaine ( this is what we are naming our daughter)  Rellah Marie  Ellery Sinclaire  Merritt Rome  Larken Selene  Sora Masen  Arwen Patrice  Callista Paige  Jensen Ivy  Kyree Myleese  Aven Rook    Boys -  Saxon Ridge (name we had chosen if we had a boy)  Bishop Caine  Lincoln Reid  Grant Lawson  Lawson Gaige  Elliot Pierce  Perry Jameson  Foster Mathis  Roman Bennett  Laiken Reid  Tucker Carson    = )|`|m6xvhlJqaa	I love all the boys names...  and gurls....|`|cWqVZ33laa	boy faves:  Landon James  Rylan James  Abner Hance?    girl faves:  Kara Layne  Lily Blaise  Kaylinn Summer  Jadizza April?  Aili Starr is sooo pretty!  Bean is an odd middle name..|`|7drjpohUaa	Boys:  Jett Lawson I don't like the name Jett, but Lawson is okay.  Greyer Jace  Greyer sounds made up, but Jace is cool.  Landon James  I LOVE Landon, and James flows well with it  Chace Parker  I also love both Chace and Parker, but I'd spell Chace like Chase  Rylan James  Rylan is cool, although I've never heard it before  Zane Hance  Zane is an awesome name!  Edge Marlow  Edge isn't a name, and Marlow sounds girlie.  Linkin Emmett  Linkin reminds me of the band Linkin Park. And Emmett is too Twilighty.  *suggestions?* Ash is a good name, I love it! Ashton, maybe?  *suggestions?* Muse no. Not good    Girls:  Mabel Harlow I love Mabel, but I like it spelled Maybell. It doesn't work well with Harlow.  Kara Layne I like Kara like Cara, and Layne like Laine. Cute name though.  Isabel Sunday I like Isabel, but Sunday is a day of the week.  Lily Blaise (pronounced Blaze) Such a cute name! Loves it!  Harper Blu I like harper but not blue. Harper Rae is better, I think.  Kaylin Echo I love Kaylin, but not Echo.  Haydan Summer Haydan is nice, but I think it's spelled Hayden.  Aili Starr (Aili means 'sweet' in german) LOVE IT.  Myra Bean No.   I don't like April.    My favorites are:    For Boys:  Landon James and Chase Parker. My suggestions are Zane Aiden, and Rylan Parker.    For Girls:  Lily Blaise and Aili Starr. For suggestions, Maybell Harper, Maybell Rae, Hayden Josephine.|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I love traditional names like Elizabeth or Catherine. I don't really like unusual names so this ought to be fun.  Boys:  Jett Lawson - Litterally, the first thing that came to my mind was 'secret agent'.   Greyer Jace - I actually like this one. Greyer is cute.  Landon James - I love the name James! I like Landon because of the movie A Walk to Remember.   Chace Parker - I like the name Chace, but spelled the usual way, Chase. I like the name Parker, also.  Rylan James- I love it!   Zane Hance - Zane is actually pretty nice for both types of people. It is sort of different, but it's not as popular as Caleb or Noah, and it has a spelling that you can spell from just hearing the name.  Edge Marlow - I really don't like names that are words in the english language, like Destiney or Trip.   Linkin Emmett  - Is this after Linkin Park? I don't really like it.   Emerson Ash - I think Emerson is a very nice name. Ash is a good middle name. It is 'in' right now.  Lucas Muse - I love the name Luke! It would be just a nick name, though. Muse is a pretty weird middle name, though. I have never heard of it before.       Girls:  Mabel Harlow - Mabel sounds like the name of a girl who is about to go milk a cow. I don't really like it. Sorry.  Kara Layne - Personally, Kara just isn't my taste. Its a nice name, I just wouldn't use it if it were me.   Isabel Sunday - I love Isabel, but Sunday is a weird middle name.   Lily Blaise (pronounced Blaze) - I absolutely love the name Blaise. I know I said I love traditional names, but this is the one name I adore! I would change Lily to Lillian. All kids should have a proper name to go by, not just a nick name.   Harper Blu - I don't like the name Harper. Again, not my taste. And she will be teased at school because of her middle name, Blu.  Kaylin Echo - Kaitlin, Kaylee, Kylie, Kaylin, names like that are very popular and overused right now.   Haydan Summer - I like the name Hayden, though I hate the spelling (for any name, not just this one) -ayden, -eydan, -eyden, or anything like that. I don't know why, though.  Aili Starr (Aili means 'sweet' in german) - Her name will be spelled, and probably pronounced, wrong her whole life. And what's up with the extra 'r' at the end of Star? Is Star not unique enough?  Myra Bean - Again, I do not know why, but I really don't like Myra. It just sounds odd to me. And she will be made fun of even more that Blu, with the middle name Bean.   This is just my opinion. For guys, I would go with (out of the names you gave):  Rylan James  and for girls:  Lily (Lillian) Blaise.     Good luck!|`|LgLpJxnwaa	Boys:  Jett Lawson - i really love the name Jett, but i think Lawson is more of a last name. Maybe Jackson ?    Greyer Jace - never heard of this one, not my fav.    Landon James - this name is really nice, love this name!    Chace Parker - again like Lawson, i think Parker is more of a last name. Chase is really awesome though !    Rylan James - i have never heard of Rylan before but i really really like it :)    Zane Hance - erm.. not to sure about this one.    Edge Marlow - Edge... nickname. Marlow makes me think of Marshmellow... No and No.    Linkin Emmett - this name is unique and cute    Tristan Ash - i like this name with my suggestion.    Kelvin Muse - im not sure how you pronounce Muse, but this is cute.    Girls:  Mabel Harlow - Mabel is a bit odd, but has a cuteness  about it :) i like it!    Kara Layne - beautiful !     Isabel Sunday - Isabel is lovely, Sunday is a DAY not a name.    Lily Blaise - LOVE IT :) lovely.    Harper Blu - i think this would be a lovely , amazing boys name.    Kaylin Echo - nah dont like it.    Haydan Summer - Summer Haydan would be alot nicer, although its still adorable.    Aili Starr - nice and simple.    Myra Bean - Myra is beautiful, Bean ??? wtf no.    Rylee April - really simple and pretty.    My favourites:  Landom James  Rylan james  Kara Layne  Lily Blaise|`|WNfAMR7Eaa	like them ther unique.  my favorite boys name is jett lawson it sounds detectivey.  and my favorite girls one is myra bean its really cute.|`|9wS0LxjLaa	my son is Jett :):)...

Rylan James - cute :)  Zane Hance - not a fan :S  Edge Marlow - cute.. different.. it's alright :P  Linkin Emmett - verrry cute :)  *suggestions?* Ash - how about Parker Ash/ James Asher?  *suggestions?* Muse - how about Robert Muse/Rylan Muse?

Chace Parker - -  I would reverse this to Parker Chace  Rylan James - - This one is cool  Zane Hance - - I think these both would sound better with a 2-syllable name in front and used as middle names instead     Edge Marlow - -  I prefer the 2-syllable in front, Marlow Edge  Linkin Emmett - - This one is cool too.  *suggestions?* Ash - - What 'bout Jameson Ash?  *suggestions?* Muse - - What about Landon Muse?    Girls:  Mabel Harlow - - Mabel is pretty old, so I would use it as the middle name and go with Harlow Mabel instead    Kara Layne - - This sounds like Penny Lane...  Isabel Sunday - - This is a great name, I like it best  Lily Blaise (pronounced Blaze) - What about Lilleigh as a different spelling since you are so unique with the middle name?    Harper Blu - I like this one too  Kaylin Echo - This one is cool, but Echo reminds me of the character on Lost LOL    Haydan Summer - This one is different, but I have only seen "Hayden" used so far in boys...    Aili Starr (Aili means 'sweet' in german) - This one is cool too, my niece's middle name is Starr    Myra Bean - This one might bring some jokes so I don't think I would go with Bean unless it is a family name    *suggestions?* April  - -  What about Lilliana/Lillianna or Rosaleigh as a first name?    I picked mostly the 2-syllables in front because I can just hear them now when you are yelling at the kid when he/she is in trouble, and it flows better....I know you remember those days of having your first and middle names yelled at you when you were in trouble, right?  LOL    Hope this helps! :)|`|MHhFMdWoaa	Personal likes:  Rylan James  Linkin Ash  Haydan Blu      I have a personal dislike for Landon. Edge is different, but not bad. I know someone named Echo....she wasn't very nice, so that killed my like for that name. I don't like Mabel Harlow (or any combo of those names....they sound kind of old). And Myra Bean might be too "out there" for me.
j2mRop0laa	I see it your way for a couple of reasons. She is obviously "beaten down" emotionally as well as physically. A few bad beatings per year aren't going to sway her commitment to a man that yo yo's his behavior and love for her. She probably feels guilty for "doing something wrong" and "pushing his buttons", even though you and I know that it is 100% HIS fault. She cannot see that.  She DOES need help. If I were you I would really push for more resources to be used on this lady. Home visits, counseling, welfare, job search help etc. I'm sure you already try to use the time you have with her wisely. Encourage the other women to do the same. Maybe something will click during one of her "healing visits.    ETA: I know it's hard for the other women you work with to understand. I keep coming back to this post because I think of how, even I, have a hard time building sympathy with abused women- but if I dig deep it's there. I had my throat slit (obviously only through a layer or so of skin, nothing serious by medical standards) and my rib cage broken and STILL didn't leave. It takes ONE occurrence to walk away. She just isn't there, yet. (this was years ago and almost like a vague memory. I'm sending her positive thoughts!)|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Make sure the other employees remember the age old rule:    Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day; teach a man to fish and he'll eat forever.    Basically, teach this woman some coping skills so she's not continuously coming back for help. Continue to help her - but help her enough so that she won't need you anymore.|`|prqrQcd1aa	If she is a drug user then yes in a way you are enabling her. Let me explain. Most programs in my area are only available once a year for people, some more than that, but... If she is a drug user and you keep on paying her way, you are also paying her mind set that she can continue to use drugs, Next time she comes in i would tell her that she needs to go to a rehab, not a hospital, in order to get help.   IF she is in an abusive situation, then once again where i live she would be forced to get a PFA or protection from abuse order in order to get services, i understand why you are doing all this, trust me, i do. But, if she is in either of these situations think about how you would feel if she went back home and was either abused again or else used again and ended up dead... or unable to wake up in some vegitative state. I think the best thing to do is get her the help she really needs.. and then help her further, if she isn't willing to do that, then she should not be helped.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Helpful.  I wish there were more people out there that thought like you :)|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	she needs help if she keeps going back.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I wouldn't really call that enabling.  To me, you are helping her when she asks for help.   I think enabling is when you are contributing to the situation, or if you have the power to force them to get help and you don't.  Someone who continually lends money to someone who is addicted to gambling or drugs, a mother who lets her adult children live at home for free and sleep all day on the couch for example.  This is a different case, you can't make her leave her husband, and you can't really turn her away either.  It is not her with the problem either, it's not like she is an addict, or lazy, if anything she could be considered as enabling her husband to continue what he is doing as she is allowing it.  I realize it is more complicated than that, all you can do is help her when she comes in, do what you can, offer counselling, but in the end it will be ultimately up to her.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I suppose it's a bit of both.  But just because it feels like you are enabling this behavior doesn't mean that you should stop helping her.  I understand how frustrating it can be to see this kind of vicious cycle.  My friend used to be in that very cycle but thankfully she came to her senses one day.      I believe this woman needs to hit her absolute rock bottom.  She may have not hit that realization point yet.  Just pray for her, help her when she shows up, and encourage her to seek professional help so she can get out of this abusive relationship.      Think of it this way:  God helps us, forgives us, loves us regardless of what we choose after He does.  And He always takes us back with open arms no matter what we choose.  I know we are human and imperfect, but if God can love me with all that I do and the wrong choices I make throughout my life then helping this woman is no different.    My prayers are with her also.|`|MkZF3pqXaa	How can she continually be going back to a bad situation?  She needs some counseling, not just things and a ride to the hospital.  She needs someone to hold her hand as she fills out the police reports for the abuse.  She needs someone to help her get her resume together and find a job.  She needs someone to tell her it's not okay to be going back to the man who continually beats her.  She needs professional counseling.  I would try to really talk to her next time she comes in.  Show her records of how many times she has been there and ask if she wants to live the rest of her life like that.  Tell her you want to help her move on with her life and be treated with the love and respect she deserves.  Help her file police reports so this man is put behind bars for what he has done.  If she won't file them, file them yourself.  You know what is happening and have records.  The police can get the medical records from the hospital to back up your story.    But you need to find out why she is choosing to go back, and help her get out of that cycle, not just put a bandaid on a gaping wound.
VR9KhbEgaa	I have been in retail mgmt. for over 12 years. And have had 6 babies since. With my 5th son I used my hip to move a mobile "wall" that was stuck on the carpet. That day & the next I had severe cramps! In my experience you have just over exerted yourself. Take it easy for a few days & be careful going forward. You should be fine....if you start bleeding then you need to get to the dr. asap!|`|k9nLue0Uaa	Symptoms of Miscarriage  vaginal bleeding that doesn't stop within a few days  abdominal cramping  lower backache  heavy bleeding accompanied by blood clots or tissue      I would contact your doctor if your really worried. But it's normal to have some cramping I know I was and still is always in pain.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Go to the hospital now, and see whats going on, they can sometimes stop your body from aborting, and from now on, don't do any of that stuff, I am on bed rest now because of dragging a recliner across the room, I am 30 weeks along and been on bedrest because of it since week 16. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|GM8Djn2Aaa	it can possibly lead to miscarriage because that had happened to me before. I was lifting the desk for the computer and after that had felt cramping afterward. Go and check up before it's too late.|`|a6ie8h4aaa	I don't think moving a dresser is a huge deal, but if you do miscarry, you will always wonder.  With my first pregnancy, I didn't know I was pregnant until after six weeks- and I played full contact coed soccer until I was 12 months (with doctors permission).  My son was born 10lbs, healthy as can be.  With my first miscarriage, I wasn't careful at all because of how things went with my first pregnancy- I helped my coworkers move my entire office to another building.  I never had cramping, just started lightly bleeding one day and that's when the doctors told me I miscarried.  So, even though the doctors say I probably did not cause it, I will always wonder!  All I can say is that what's done is done and and just try to be careful from now on.  I truly wish you good luck!
AA12068970	Because of the risk of a miscariage Ive always told my self that I wanted  to wait the first 3 months or 12 weeks to tell anyone. That and I have always wanted to just enjoy the thrill of being pregnant to my self before anyone knows. Its really a mater of opinnion. If i was in your situation and worried about my moms health I would wait tell I knew everything was okay with the pregnancy. Just take it easy. You only have a few weeks left. Just take it day by day and tell your mom when you feel the time is right!!! I wish you the best of luck!!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	12-14 weeks sounds ideal to me in your case|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	In my opinion, the most important thing you have said is that for some reason you have told your MIL but not your own mother. Wow, her feelings will really be hurt when she finds that out.   The whole idea of when to tell or not tell is between you and your husband. However, since you have ALREADY shared this very special and wonderful "secret" with your MIL, I think you should tell your own Mom ASAP.|`|LMUwz5y8aa	Tell her now.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I think it would be a good thing. Especially since your mom has gone through so much. It might give her the inspiration she needs at this moment.|`|CVA86LY6aa	I say tell your mom.

I was 32 weeks when I lost mine. You can loose your mucus plug early, long before you go into labor, or can not loose it until after your already in labor. I would suggest if your worried go in away. I didn't want to go into the hospital when I was having pains because I didn't want to look silly if I wasn't in labor. My husband convinced me to go and I ended up being in labor at 36 weeks. If the pains are steady and at regular intervals that can be a sign your in labor.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Your are fine! Starting labor! yay!! Its a normal color, its fine.

I found oout I was pregnant shortly after that and we decided to get married sooner than expected. We were together a total of 7 months when we were married. We have a beautiful 1 yr old and have married almost 2 yrs and going strong|`|AA11850523	you need to all step back ,  take a deep breath and try to relax    there is a possibility that the wedding will not take place  or   that you will get to know him and like him  or you will get to know him and not like him     any scenario      its not your or your family's life that is on the table for discussion   its your sisters life/future    the more you say against the guy or against the possible marriage the MORE you will make her defend her choice and push her towards him|`|fc9HpLM3aa	omg i feel you girl. same **** happened to me like last week. came home sister was ******* some dude in MY ROOM. i was like WTF girl she was like im SO SORRY. found out after i beat her that she couldnt do it in her room because she accidentally **** herself the night before so she had to do it in my room. but this is besides the point. they have been dating 3 weeks and she tells me they are getting married next month! im SO SAD!!! i need help too!!!!!
la8W09sFaa	i had the same thing going on with me, and i was shocked to find out it was a cyst. i had the nausea, the cramping, the very light periods, and spotting. if you are 2 weeks late and the test was neg. i would either accept it, or go to the doc's for a blood test if you need that for peace of mind. good luck. i hope u get what u want!!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	take another test. if that's negative see a doctor so he can help you get to the bottom of things.
QGkBZFqWaa	I like pot. Pot is fun. But my boyfriend won't let me smoke it.  Just ask if they want to go to the mall or something. Can't smoke pot in a mall :]    Okay the dummy above me is wrong.  You can turn back if you wanted. It's non-addictive.  It's a freaking plant. It grows out of the ground like every other plant.|`|laLW1Krwaa	DONT DO IT   IT KILLS YOU   DONT FALL INTO PEER PRESSURE ITS A BAD THING  DONT DO IT|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Find some new friends.  You're clearly smarter than these.|`|GZqmZ8Ahaa	do not do it that is a very bad thing to get into doing and you will never stop change friends and go to the counciler to get help NOW!|`|rsYbDHWRaa	dont do drugs :)|`|dX63OGoaaa	Say stop being f.ucking idiots and lets do something that isn't illegal and harmful.|`|dqZ2eglPaa	Don't give in to peer pressure.    If she's your true friend, she will understand. Make sure you have a conversation with her BEFORE you're in the situation where you may be smoking pot, so that it isn't a more stressful situation than it should be.    PS. I don't think that smoking pot is a good idea, but I can't really tell you what to do. Make a good decision!|`|jmgarxS3aa	As you said, you know how dumb it is. Well, obviously you don't fully know how dumb it is. Do you want to live a good life, or a life full of sickness because you made a dumb decision like this?      No matter what your friends are doing, and how much you feel that you should do it too, you honestly shouldn't. They made a bad decision, and you shouldn't follow what they are doing. Tell your friend she is dumb, and she shouldn't be smoking it, and that she will regret it. If you follow her lead, you will BADLY regret it as well. Don't do it.    Don't do it, you will regret it a lot if you do. I wish you luck in making the right decision. (:    Hope this helps.|`|0Xr2e7Kgaa	Please don't.    My friend went on a mental breakdown because he smoked laced pot, and he was in the hospital for over a month. And my other friend tried it, and she felt so sick after doing it.      If your friend asks you, just say, "I'm off pot." or just say you don't care if they do it, but that you personally don't.    And the friend that got sick realized how stupid it was, and quit.    And make sure your friends know you won't do it.  I have friends who do that, and they just do it without me, because they know I don't do drugs.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Most of the time, pot leads to other drugs, I can't tell you what to do but try not to start doing this on a regular basis like that. I tried it once, and will never do it again.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Tell her, she can find a new friend.  Smoking pot is illegal.
mGQOgjeYaa	girl:) i have all girls too|`|eeyGYRcPaa	i think girl...it may be possible that you can't carry boys. my aunt and grandmother couldn't...|`|ZDZlvqvsaa	I would say, Girl, Congrats!|`|2fa52a8e6b6c75385da254c267fc7595aa	I have 4 children. 2 girls and 2 boys.   that is a GIRL mama! lol. guess you get to buy more cute dresses. Congratulations|`|8hwGmfs8aa	girl.....i am also 24 weeks with a girl :):):) congrats  wen is your due date???|`|HIn1p4OBaa	i can't see a thing. but congrats anyway!! baby's are so precious!!|`|ddrP5HyNaa	pretty sure its a baby girl! congrats!|`|VHHis05Naa	It's definitely a girl!  I'd love to have all girls... I have one and don't know the sex of the one I'm carrying.|`|euUZZcM3aa	That definitely looks like a girl to me!!! =] congrats!!!!!!|`|FSZIzDsPaa	Girl. Sorry. They say if it looks like a hamburger it's a girl. Weird I know, but it really does look like that. I have 5 sisters and I love it, so don't be too hard on yourself. You'll love her the same!|`|YP3rEESUaa	I'm pretty sure thats a girl!!!  CONGRATS!!!
OFToxXGZaa	Obviously no-one can be sure but I would say that yes you are. If your injection has run out and you have not had another one then you should have gotten your period by now because you are no longer on any type on birth control. The fact that you haven't is an indication that you could be pregnant. Group that with the facts of sore boobs and the sickness I would say yes. When I was 7.5 weeks pregnant I took 5 pregnancy tests and they were all negative
69K4WoSoaa	Honestly, I started washing down there, the first time I got a shower and that was after my son was born. Nothing will Irrate it. Dont soap up inside of you, but you need to get the dried blood and everything else off so you dont get an infection. You will get the hang of things, everyone is different. I was more scared someone would smell me more than anything LOL!!! Congrats on the baby!!!!|`|hqSDVWuKaa	first answer.... :-)|`|lzUF22l0aa	im pretty sure its safe now ... 3 weeks is a while maybe you should use something for sensative skin like a summers eve wash. I washed with soap 2 days after you have to keep it clean you could have gotten an infection. best of luck|`|PWVYYh2Haa	by now you are more than able to use soap, to be safe for the first 6 months after i had all three of my kids i used, dial, it is antibacterial, and it has no addittives.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Well, first CONGRATULATIONS MOMMY!  Ummm, when I was stitched up I used soap there that day in the shower.  I didn't have any problems.  Good luck!    It usually takes 5-6 weeks for it to heal completely and the stitches to dissolve.  I think your okay to use soap(anti bacterial) I'm sure it will be fine, if not try different soap, maybe call your DR and have her recommend something.|`|4nAl9Y7Baa	I definitely agree that you can clean down there now with dial soap.|`|AA11459214	Try summers eve it's really nice to use down there.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	The first answer is right;) Good question though.
bZWbwyn4aa	I hate that - my daughter started that too.  The first time she spat at me, I was so shocked I slapped her and told her she was a "dirty little girl".  I don't recommend this - I feel really bad about it, but I was just so shocked at the time I reacted without thinking!  However, it did work - she's never spat at me again.  However, she did still spit at others, so it isn't the solution.    I would recommend devising a punishment specifically for when he spits.  If you know what his currency is, use that.  For instance, my daughter (who is nearly 4) doesn't like having to be sent to her room for time out, so that is what she gets for any violent or disgusting behaviour, including spitting. Your son may have different likes and dislikes you can use.  If time out works for other things, then it will probably work for this too.  Maybe he has a favourite toy you can threaten to remove next time he does this.    Just make sure he is aware of the punishment for next time he does it.  And he will do it - just to test you.  Stick to your guns and make sure he is punished exactly as you told him he would be.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Well you might not agree, but in my house that would warrant a spanking.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I would pop my son in the mouth. That is nasty!!!   (I know I'll get some thumbs down for this one)|`|Qz3sii2caa	Ever hear of a belt?     Make an example out of the spitter and belt them in front of the little one. Tell the little one "this is what happens to bad kids who spit"    EDIT: Oh 3?! Well gosh then, just let it pass. Kids do all kinds of weird things when they're toddlers. Just give the kid a swat on the behind and send the kid to the corner for a time out.  I thought you were talking about like a 5 or 6 year old or something.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	Beat him thats DiSRESPECTTFUL thats why this GENERATiON iS SO MESSED UP!!|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	Disciplinee the spitting that will just turn into hitting as the child gets older if nothing is done about and that is definitely disgusting  but i DO agree with the people that say to spank once.. i don't mean to hit hard but a little hit on the behind and that will at least give some meaning to the child that ... it is wrong to do that.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	Spank the child. I'm not saying to beat him, just a firm slap that will serve as a reminder next time he wants to spit at you. Time outs are the second option, but they aren't as effective.|`|AA10458195	You don't say how old the child is, but it doesn't matter. Spitting is  a nasty habit, and as his mother you must let him know that will not  be tolerated. You may have to sit him on a chair for a period of time  or take something away. If you believe in spanking then you may  have to try that. Either way if you don't put a stop to it now he will go  from that to worse things.|`|AA11537580	how old?  under 1year, a stern look and a big NO then stop whatever it is you where doing for a minute or so    over one year a big NO and 2 minute timeout    EDIT: do NOT put soap in your child's mouth like some have suggested, they could be allergic and their throat could close up|`|cBMwHdn4aa	It may be that your child is trying to show you the ultimate form of disrespect.  For kids, you cannot show disrespect in your punishment nor humiliation, where simply spitting back would do so.    If age appropriate, I would explain how disrespectful that is and that he won't be treated respectfully by anyone with such behavior.    Then PUNISH him.  Time out, but follow through.    Good Luck|`|kWBXSjHXaa	my sister always spits on me and my parents nver get mad so  i dont know just tell her nt to spit LOL|`|LQminEIEaa	My daughters came out with some terrible language and i put soap a little soap in the back tooth for a lasting taste to teach them a lesson, maybe could work for this to. I only had to do it twice than they were very aware not to say things like that again.|`|iLLoc003aa	pop him lightly in the mouth and ask him if he likes that...he will stop,|`|gfxWtVbraa	Spit back. That will definitely teach him/her a lesson that will not be forgotten.|`|ZMbxvF5Faa	yeah spit back your kid will be like wtf|`|1PpT9MRSaa	It really depends on how old your child is. Then if it is a toddlr then just try to explain good manners|`|7TRp1p94aa	Hmmm That's definitely a habit you want to break early.  Maybe soap in the mouth every time it happens.|`|hGmq5IuZaa	get a fan|`|FQhlQss0aa	teach them a lesson|`|cz9dogpvaa	he needs to be spank and sent to a time out that is how i got my to stop|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	tell him that the next time he does it you will wash his mouth out with soap.   (I made my son drink a very small cup of very diluted liquid soap in a lot of water) and he had apple juice straight after to get rid of the taste    Only had to do that once and he has never spit at me again.   Yes I know its harsh, but it works. My son was 4 at the time.    Hitting/spanking and timeouts do not work for my son. He does NOT easily learn consequences from such mild "punishments"   It had to be drastic like soap. Only needed to do it once.

ebM6CxRQaa	Bacterial vaginaitis does not kill sperm...|`|52bAHCaUaa	Yes|`|AZSIoSNoaa	sure can|`|nI99M6ddaa	Yes.  Bacterial vaginitis does not prevent someone from getting pregnant.

RLbN2Ujhaa	The hormone relaxin is causing your pelvis to open up to accommodate the passing of a baby. I always thought it felt like a knife stab or like you'd been riding a horse.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It could be a pinched nerve. If it keeps bothering you I would ask your doctor.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	your pee pee is broken? LOL you are a trooper!|`|FmSWPS7Paa	im having the same problems. (33 weeks) it hurts a lot but i asked the same question and i think it cause baby getting bigger and/or might be dropping a little. it sucks though. it hurts to sleep and move around|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It could be a Pubic Symphisis Dysfunction. It's where the muscle in your pubic bone becomes to soft from excess progesterone. It causes the pubic bone to grind together, It can also cause severe hip pain. It can cause your hips to separate a little to far prematurely as well. I got it, and it's extremely painful when I move around, or separate my legs. Getting out of bed is the worse. It's quite common and happens at about this time or sooner. Mine started at 22 weeks. Not fun!
kaqPSgTVaa	That happened to me and that's common and normal. You just had a rush of hormone and your body decided to produce a tiny amount of milk. You are fine.|`|e37a9cf314739079d92d3c17e77efa90aa	Don't worry. That happened to me 9 months after I stopped breastfeeding. Really got me scared though. Take it easy.  Good luck
r0BHJk6Yaa	everyone is diff. they say it makes no diff if you were on it a week or 30 years...or not at all.    but who knows..    the only thing is if you never had hormonal bc you wont neeed to let your body regulate itself..so you should have a basically simple cycle..and therefore easier and quicker for youto track your ovulation etc..    it can take you one month so first try...oir it could take= a year which is the average....i belive...  remember each month you have a certain % of a chance....  but really its only 12 trys in one year..so think of it that way and it doesnt seem too long.|`|AA11724307	Thats a question nobody can answer for you.  It really depends.  I have friends who conceived on their first month trying while my husband and I are at 2.5 years with no luck.  It totally depends.  Good luck though|`|LxWYVksSaa	They say it doesnt matter how long you were on birth control. Typically you should wait one entire cycle AFTER stopping birth control, as it takes some time for your body to start developing the hormones for you to go back to your natural cycle.  Then you should trying.    I have been off BC since July. I had a normal period after one month, but 4 months later still struggling to get a normal period to determine my ovulation date.    Every woman is different, some get pregnant fairly quickly. It all depends on how your body will re-adjust itself.    If you had problems with your cycle BEFORE bC, the same problems will still exist, i.e irregularity. Because you have been off BC for 10 years, you natural cycle for your age will also show itself.    Good luck!|`|lTkYWiy5aa	You have a 25% chance of conceiving each month. 50% of people trying conceive within 6 months, 85% within 1 year. If you haven't conceived in 1 year, see your doctor (6 months if you are over 35).    Good luck and baby dust!!!
49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	That depends what you think normal is.  Each women's body is different.  I have been pregnant three times so if it were to happen to me with a subsequent pregnancy then it would not be normal.  For you this may very well be normal because there have been many reports of this happening.  It is just your body shedding old blood.  If you begin getting period like cramps, bleeding heavy bright red blood, or have more pink spotting then I would become concerned.|`|euUZZcM3aa	As long as it's not bright red, doesn't become heavier, and isn't painful, it should be normal. I had this also, and I had it once after I had sex. If it worsens, or if you're concerned, see your doctor    Good luck and congrats =)|`|GdSzrtmAaa	yes, but if you are concerned you should contact your ob doc.|`|GJ0IDpULaa	um sometimes yes it's normal but if you have cramps and your brown turns to lighter red go to the er or dr asap cause that is not a good sign|`|wScYLSkwaa	I found a site that might help explain this situation. Go to google search and punch in "bleeding during pregancy". It should show as the first thing on the list.
kRaVa0Wraa	eat ice.  chew gum.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	How about jogging those over the limit calories off or just going for a walk with a friend or so, it'll get you out the house & away from the food plus you'll be getting some nice exercise in|`|ZllkWRIOaa	some fat under ur skin u pig|`|0ypw5nKOaa	I reccomend chewing gum. It makes you feel like you're eating when you're not. Also, try brushing your teeth.

vhuqAqNdaa	You seem like a sensible level headed girl, and more responsible than some 27 year old's I know! So don't let people put you down for your 'mistakes'. Try to claim welfare to help you out a bit while your deciding. claim your a single parent!(some people won't agree) but it's in the best interest of your child(and when you do have a job, you will be paying tax for the rest of your life). really research the courses, most are no good, ask employers of the career you want what type of qaulification would stand to you when applying, then save up and do the right one. Good Luck!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Just because you are not going to attend college now, doesn't mean you don't ever have to.Your plans have been derailed and now you have to have an alternative plan.    Why not go to college after the baby is a year or so?    Is your boyfriend going to change jobs/careers in order to provide more?    You guys might even end up going without the net and cable in order to support your family.    Sacrifices such but they have to happen in order to provide the best.    You can even do a little budgeting.Do coupons, WIC, and find a good quality dollar store in your area.    Good luck.|`|J7ByVZ3Aaa	1,000 for rent seems a bit high for half a house. Perhaps you all could find something cheaper. Also, unless you have someone to watch the baby, it would probably cost you more to put the baby in daycare than watch it yourself. Community classes usually are cheaper than 4- year colleges, and some states will pay your tuition if you have a certain GPA. I assume you would take out student loans to pay for college, usually there is some money left over, and you would get the maximum amount of loans from the government.|`|n86nMfbtaa	I believe it's okay to take welfare checks, but only for as long as you need it. But right now, it sounds like that's the best solution for you. You need to do what's best for your baby... you sound mature enough to handle this. I'm sure you'll qualify. Oh, and definately get on WIC. They don't judge solely on your income.    Good luck!|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	well since you are pregnant you do qualify for wic as well as medi-cal and food stamps.. since your not married that is.. you must tell them that you live with your boyfriend but you buy food and prepare meals separatly... also you should maybe think about downsizing some of your bills... the wic and foodstamps should give you a little help with your grocery bill and medi-cal would be your health insurance.. as for the job, i think it would depend on how far along you are, if you are more than 6 months you should probably just relax. also might be hard to find a job when your pregnant.. alot of places want long term not just for a few months, you obviously wont be working after delivery of your baby... newborn daycare is at least 500-1000 dollars a month, it would probably be easier if you just watched the baby at home untill he or she is a little bigger. a job and a baby, living on your own, bills, roomates, school, thats a big load... might be really tough and put a lot of stress on you, which is not very healthy when your pregnant..    try to stay on your feet.. good luck to you and the daddy...  youll get through it fine, if your good enough to keep the baby and not abort it like most people in your situation than both of you deserve to make a good life out of what you got...theres always a way and im sure youll find it
52bAHCaUaa	Well, have you gotten pregnant in the last 5 years? If not...I'd say its working for you.    Unless you worded your question wrong?|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	You can get pregnant on any birth control, there is no absolute guarantee, though BC is quite effective.|`|4nAl9Y7Baa	As far as my doctor told me you can't get pregnant on the mirena, but once it is removed you can.|`|Z1atdG4kaa	I had that too til i got it removed to have another baby. But my doc told me it is very highly unlikely to get pregnant while on it, BUT if you do get prego then you have to inform the doc right away to get it removed and the process of removal could kill it. I never had a problem with it though and I plan to go back on it once the lil one comes.|`|wphI41wNaa	You cant while its in but i read if you have sex the day or a couple days before its removed you still can because sperm lives up to 5 days in you but you have to ovulate
c61c4f44c63edf2ae9007329580c8a0faa	Yes this is bad at 13 your not mature enough or responsible enough to care for a child and therefore should wait.  Focus on school and your family at home and forget sex until your much older.  I know I will get thumbs down for this answer but I believe in the sanctity of marriage and keeping one true until wedding night.|`|dPULl5hjaa	whatever - if sex makes you feel big - who cares    it's your choice - what an immature action for 13|`|MigBOiUPaa	wow!  yea thts bad wut if u get pregnant and have no one to help u since u have no parents....|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Yeah that's bad.

I felt cramps exactly like a period.  It was so weird, because obviously I hadn't had a period in quite a while.  I was so irritated that I couldn't take Advil.  And 24 hours later my water broke.  But my whole situation was a little weird so I wouldn't necessarily take this as a sign of labor.|`|Je43PBM6aa	Hey I think you might be alright your body is probably starting to get ready to give birth I had the same thing...with my second one I had contractions at 8 months about every 10 minutes but I wasn't dilating so I just walked around like that till I gave birth. If you spot or they become really consistent GO IN, even if you feel silly it's always better to be safe than sorry. But honestly everything sounds normal to me : ) If you have any other questions please feel free to write me.|`|aruZr146aa	Well im only 9 weeks and i get cramps but no blood it could mean your getting early contractions or growing of the baby still, you might want to go see your doctor.|`|AA11185954	The baby might just be shifting around.  I had a few times when I couldn't walk for a few hours because of it.    Try sitting and laying in different positions until you're comfortable    So long as it's not screaming pain and you're not bleeding (or leaking fluids), give it a little while but if it doesn't get better soon I would call your doctor or hospital and ask them before you make the trip in.    Just remember it's not only your health to be concerned with at this point.  Better safe than sorry.|`|uOp2sdiQaa	your body is probably giving you signs that its starting to get ready. i'm 30 weeks with twins, and i've been having contractions, that only last 5-10seconds and only a few times a day if that and mild cramping. my nurse told me its a sign your body is getting ready.     if your cramping gets worse or you start having contractions that are about 5 minutes apart, than i would be concerned, but i would call the er too before you think about going in, just to ask=]    good luck!!!
1CryEnb3aa	Yes.  Don't worry you may even have faint spotting.  This is normal from the exam.  Now, if you start bleeding bright red blood and heavy, call the dr or go to the E.R. to get checked to be on the safe side.  Always better to be safe than sorry.  Congrats on the baby!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Could be. If it gets worse call your doctor but more than likely it is from the exam.|`|AA11476951	It could be from the exam. Sit down and put your feet up. Rest! Don't worry too much unless the pain continues to get worse or you begin to bleed.|`|xIF2lShpaa	Yes, it is very normal, mainly because of the pushing on the uterus during your exam. It is "stressed".Just rest a little bit, and take some tylenol for the pain if you have to. That's what I did. I had pains after every exam. Good luck, and Congrats!

Bleeding during pregnancy is more common than you might think  around 30% of women experience bleeding during pregnancy. Around half of those women will continue on to have a healthy baby and the other half will have a miscarriage. The most likely time bleeding can occur is in the first trimester.    Some women have a once-off bleed, others may bleed throughout their whole pregnancy. This may be in the form of spotting, streaking, period-like blood loss or more.    Those women who need to see a doctor within 72 hours of every bleed are those who have rhesus negative blood groups (e.g. O-, A-). See our article, Rhesus Negative Blood Groups In Pregnancy for more information.    All bleeding should be reported to your doctor or midwife. Any passage of blood from the vagina of a pregnant women before 24 weeks will be termed a threatened miscarriage or threatened abortion. After 24 weeks its termed an ante-partum haemorrhage.    Below is an explanation of some of the more common reasons for bleeding during pregnancy, and as you will read, its not always sinister.  Implantation Bleeding or Streaking    When a fertilised egg attaches to the uterine lining, this can result in light spotting or streaking (streaks of blood). Usually this only lasts a day or two, however do mention it to your carer for safe measure. Implantation bleeding is usually bright fresh blood like that which you would expect to see if you cut your finger. It can also be in the form of a pink mucous stain.  Breakthrough Bleeding    Some women experience what is known as breakthrough bleeding at the times when your period would have normally been due. So this would be at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is often accompanied by the feeling that you would normally associate with your period being imminent i.e. back ache, cramps, a heavy sensation in your pelvis, feeling bloated and a?offa?. Of course the period doesna?t arrive (even though you feel like it will) because you are actually pregnant! During pregnancy, hormones prevent your period from occurring. Sometimes the hormone levels are not yet high enough to stop your period and therefore you have this breakthrough bleeding. It can last for around three months  after this time the placenta begins to take over hormone production from your ovaries. Some women may experience breakthrough bleeding throughout the whole pregnancy and have healthy babies, under the close watch of their carer.  Threatened or Actual Miscarriage    Studies indicate that around one third of pregnancies end in miscarriage (the medical term is spontaneous abortion) but dont despair  these figures refer to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, including very early miscarriages that occur before you even realise that you are pregnant. Often this is a result of a damaged or imperfect fetus  your body may reject a pregnancy that it knows will not be normal.    Once you have reached the 14-16 week mark you can be fairly sure that your pregnancy is safe. Its probably not such a bad idea to refrain from telling the world you are pregnant until you get to the 12 week mark for this reason. Although you might be busting to share your wonderful news, it can be very distressing to have to tell the world again if you lose the pregnancy. Sometimes sympathy is comforting but sometimes it can be overwhelming when you are grieving for lost dreams.    Common signs of miscarriage include bleeding (being most common), cramping, backache and stomach pains. Women commonly say that they no longer a?feel pregnanta? when they have miscarried and are bleeding. The signs of pregnancy disappear, no more nausea, sore breasts of bloated tummy. If you are bleeding and feel like this then chances are that you have lost the fetus. If you are bleeding but still feel pregnant then the chances are very good that the bleeding is just a scare and the little one is hanging on in there. An ultrasound will usually be reassuringly normal.    It is possible to miscarry without any bleeding, which is known as a missed abortion. The fetus dies but is retained by your body. The signs of pregnancy would definitely have disappeared if this happens but the absence of a heartbeat would only be detected on ultrasound. You may need a curette to clear out the uterus.    For more information, see our article, Miscarriages  Saying Goodbye Before Youve Said Hello.  Bleeding After Sex    a?Post-coital bleedinga? is one of the most common causes of vaginal blood loss. This is completely harmless and is caused by increased blood supply and softening|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	It's normal unless it starts hurting.|`|77NzfiVkaa	If your doctor said it is then quit stressing out. If you really wanted another opinion go to a different doctor because seriously what are people on Yahoo Answers going to be able to do for you?|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Did he actually examine you or test your hcg levels?  If not, I would have him do that.    To answer your question, some women do have 'periods' while pregnant, although, it's pretty rare.  It is, however, fairly normal to have spotting during pregnancy.  If you're bleeding a lot, and you haven't had any testing, ultra sounds, etc than I would get them done.  It will help ease your mind knowing that your baby is safe.      ETA:  Sorry, but I've learned it's best to go with your gut.  I found out the hard way that doctors aren't always right.  :(  Do what YOU feel is right.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	as far as i knew, spotting was ok. bleeding a lot is not.    i started bleeding and 3 days later i was at the hospital having a miscarriage.   if you are bleeding a lot tomorrow, i'd call my dr again or go to the hospital|`|jNgh3e3Faa	If you already talked to the doc, then you are fine.  It is not a period.   A lot can be scary. Make sure to keep regular appointments.   You cannot have a period while you are pregnant because both of these functions cannot happen at the same time. If you were pregnant and began menstruating, inevitably you would lose the pregnancy or have a miscarriage. Although you can't be pregnant and have a period at the same time, you can, in fact, experience vaginal bleeding and continue to be pregnant. These are two very different terms: vaginal bleeding and menstruation (period), but it is usually vaginal bleeding that women confuse as their periods.   Bleeding early in pregnancy, as in the first trimester, is scary, but luckily it usually doesn't signal a problem. It is also rather common among women. There are a few common causes of first-trimester bleeding, none of which is an indication of trouble.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	Yup, it's normal, it can happen.|`|0a1txkfraa	your spotting|`|5aufFeiUaa	are you filling a pad an hour?  The thing about bleeding is that as long as it isn't accompanied w/cramping, doctors consider it normal.  Many, many women have periods throughout their whole pregnancy.  If you're worried, I would ask them to give you a beta test to make sure everything is ok.  If you're far enough along, I would also ask for an ultra sound.|`|e99558c7c874edb09af2121c3e8bf91faa	its normal.|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	No, there is nothing normal about bleeding when you're pregnant, especially what you call "a lot" of bleeding. It doesn't aways mean the worst, but it means something isn't quite right. Some women have some spotting, usually brown, after sex from an irritated cervix. How far along are you?  ~~~ There is NO WAY you can have a period (which is the shedding of your uterine lining) and sustain a pregnancy since the baby is implanted in that lining!!!! If you're bleeding, it's not a "period"; it could be a placental hemorrhage or something, but not a period.|`|MXXOICquaa	it is normal for some people but dont wear tampons and check for clots. clots are a sign of miscarriage good luck to u and the baby|`|rjnM8Qhxaa	It is normal, but you're not actually on your period.
x4uGfC4oaa	Wait until after you miss your period. It's much more accurate then. False positives are rare... If you test positive, and later you find out you're not pregnant, it means you were pregnant, but you lost the baby.  Good luck.
kaqPSgTVaa	I would think it would be accurate by now. Most women are able to test accuratly on the date of their missed period. Take another test in 3 days and if it's still negative I think you have your answer. You're period could just be late because of stress. You may even skip an entire period due to stress. I happens a lot.|`|2ucsbBGjaa	theres always the pre-ejaculant, but if there was no penetration then I doubt pre-ejaculant could have gotten you preggers.  If you are worried and stressed it could be prolonging you not having a period.|`|tZU9k9zNaa	I doubt that you're pregnan t since you said there was penetration involved.Dont worry...You may or may not get a positive after 2 weeks of intecourse.|`|T9fek24eaa	If there was no penetration and nothing came out and you got a negative test, I think that are you are safe. As far as it being accurate, sometimes it takes longer to get a positive pregnancy test, but normally, it should be showing positive by now.|`|pcjLTnwTaa	I think the chances are pretty slim of being pregnant without penetration or ejaculation. But I guess there still is a very small possibility of pre-*** somehow getting in. Sometimes when we stress about these things we can somehow make our period delayed. Our bodies are strange things and I have heard of people thinking they were pregnant and their period not coming, but then as soon as they find our for sure that they are not pregnant then their period comes. If your period still doesn't come then test again in a few days. And if it still doesn't come then see your doctor.    Good luck.|`|JsshzKM9aa	Your period is late because you're worried. Stop stressing.

Ha, funny.|`|Aa7dLKntaa	heh  well i think you should try talking to him and maybe drop some hits that you still like him  then wait a couple of days and find out if he like you or not  oh and most likely depending on the type of guy he is, he still likes you but if hes the kinda guy who gets over ppl fast then maybe not.  you just have to make sure you know for sure before you go for it (:  hope that helps|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Just ask him.

Each time she demonstrates the bias, write down the date, time and a summary of what happened.     It's going to be very difficult for her to deny stuff that you've been writing down.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	They would deny it. If you ask your sister, she probably feels it is in fact you who gets the majority of the attention.|`|aavNyOeyaa	Usually its the opposite, i'm the youngest and my parents usually do whatever i want to do(sounds bad but i don't take advantage) And i dunno, maybe you were adopted or something, or your moms just weird.|`|L1FqPE3Vaa	With me, it's so different. Let's pray for eachother. Deal?|`|Na9JeWLoaa	Usually, the parents are new to the whole parenting thing when they have their first child, so they get more attention. When the second or third come along, the parents are more tired and not as bothered to do everything for that child. My hypothesis for later in life is because the first child always hold a sentimental value because they are the first child. They also don't have to live up to someone else's standards and expectations.|`|9nvyGGzlaa	I am also the youngest and in most cases they are the spoiled one. I think that daughter moving out has left a void that mom is trying to fill. My advice to you is to have a heart to heart with your parents and let them know how you feel. this will more than likely pass and leave you with more attention than you want. does sister have a baby because that changes EVERYTHING.

dBn88meIaa	I'm so sorry this happened to you. Your father shouldn't have gone that far. If it makes you feel any better-when I was in 7th grade I got in a huge fight with this girl, Caren. We were texting curses to each other back and forth ad one day my mom got a phone call from her mom that said "Cora sent Caren a message telling her that she's a faguet and a b!tch." I walked in my mom's room and she sai "your in big trouble young lady sit down right now!" She hung up and started screaming so much at me like "Your a disgrace to our family! How could you do that to poor little Caren?" I said "I'm scared." she said "you better be! Where's your father?!" I didn't get spanked-I got slapped on the mouth. It was horrible. But I got over it and so did they. I don't beleive in spanking and I will never hurt my daughter Holly but he's your dad. Don't worry, sweetie. They'll get over it, soon. I promise. Sit down and have a calm, adult-like conversation with them. Tell them "Mom, Dad I think I'm getting a little too old to be spanked. I'm sorry but I feel very childish when you do that. No disrespect intended but I just feel like maybe taking away privaliges like TV or computer or cell phone or i-pod for a while would be a more suitable punishment for a 6th grader." DOn't get emotional or anything if they disagree because that would be their choice.|`|c6GKH2gpaa	You totally deserved it, you were pretty much being the stereotypical brat.

I HATED my mother for years - still do.      what your paremnts SHOULD have done was to take your IPOD and   any computer privileges you have away for 1 or 2 months - for as long as your dad is away on his trip. That would have TAUGHT you a lesson.      I see your parents as weak and not very good parents - they do not know how and when to say NO.     its not your fault - its theirs, for not saying NO to you when you were a kid.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	its disclipline Baby it'll teach you things in life your getting raised teh right way:)|`|76Wp8OINaa	You sound like a brat, I think he had just cause.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	You need to straighten your behind up. It was deserved on your part and if you don't want anymore spankings then don't act up. You are old enough to know better. I got spankings until I was 17 with a belt up until I moved out. Me not watching my sister and her getting nail polish on my mom's bed was the last thing I got one for I think. But now that I think about it she could have gotten into much more and ate something bad so I deserved it!|`|2x1Eoik4aa	yea you deserved it...you will live. maybe you should respect your parents a bit more|`|aY9v3SJKaa	No it was wrong for him to spank you.    But you are also wrong for lying, cheating and being disrepectful. And if I was your parent you wouldnt have your ipod or your computer anymore....so be glad all you got was a spanking!!|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	dont be a whiner, stop fing up in school and do your work you little brat... i would have spanked your a ss too.|`|As4et19Zaa	No offense kid but you deserved it. How about instead of talking back to your parents and actually try in school. How about you study the day before a test and actually do your homework. You need to grow up, and yes he did have the right to spank you. Oh yeah and I'm sorry all these responses aren't the ones you wanted. No, we aren't going to pity a brat.|`|590ldCvzaa	im sorry but that's embarrassing. i would not of said that on the world wide web.|`|7TRp1p94aa	You cheated...you pay    I believe in spanking even though it does sound a little excessive what your dad did (assuming you're not exaggerating).|`|s0OCyfJfaa	Ya know what sounds to me like u deserved it. plus, you are very biased in your interpretation of the event. u keep describing it like ur parents are really really bad when really i think u need to improve your attitude.    such happenings are the parent's fault up until a certain age (usually around Grade 1) and after this age u may not blame ur parents for your own actions. i get spanked all the time and im in Grade 9 so deal with it    plus i agree it is lucky they just spanked you and didn't take away your computer and iPod|`|AA11099016	I have a 13 yr old and a 5 yr old son. If you where my kids you would have gotten it a long time ago. I do not think he was in the wrong and you are a spoiled child. You should learn respect and than use it. If you respect your parent in turn they will respect you.  BTW did you think by acting like a punk was going to get you a kiss on the forehead and a slip out of trouble? RESPECT look it up.

hNa5oHxQaa	Get him the iPod nano.  9 yr olds don't have a whole lot of interests in music.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Preferably one that has the fewest features on it and doesn't cost a ton. An iPod is way too pricey a gadget for a kid to have, I think, especially when he can take it to school, lose it somewhere, or get it stolen. I think even if he's very mature he will still be a target at school (if he brings it) as it is a very expensive piece of equipment for a kid so young. How about something $40 and under?     Or better yet, how about some Matchbox cars? I can't imagine having such nice "toys" at that age, honestly.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	At nine the cheapest one|`|Qz3sii2caa	Nanos are cool, but I don't know about getting something like that for a 9 year old. I mean, where is he going to be using an iPod? At school? While walking home from the park? If it isn't taken away from him by a teacher some rotten kid will steal it out of his backpack.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	The Shuffle.|`|2JM1LEA9aa	iPod nano or Shuffle.|`|i7urUh9Yaa	My little brother has a nano, well he lost it....he's 14 and irresponsible....but I think that is a good choice for a 9 year old.  Or you could get the shuffle, those are cheaper!|`|E8qWd7Soaa	id get an ipod nano for him ^^ its small enough for him so he wouldnt have such a hard time carrying it around wow ur a really nice sister, i was planning to get my brother one too but then i decided it was too expensive to im planning to get him a cd player and just burn his favorite songs into a cd... he wont really like a lot of songs since hes still really really young... advance happy birthday to your little brother! ^^|`|rpU209Xfaa	my lil brother is 10 and has a ipod shuffle...  he hasnt lost it and it isnt over-rated...|`|m2aznd8xaa	my 9 year old has an ipod shuffle .she has had it over a year and its been through hell and its still in great condition. it small and can hide it if you don't want it to get stolen  and it has nice color cases to choose from if you want to change to color of it. it was cheap and its better to start cheap to see how well he does with it|`|tokcUJSpaa	Get him a Shuffle. They are fairly inexpensive so it wont be the end of the world if he breaks or loses it.|`|chuNwSTtaa	ipod nano, 1gb size or 2 gb size, try going to walmart.com or curcitycity.com or bestbuy.com dont go to a retail store, they forget to correct the price and you end up paying an extra 15-30 $    DONT GET HIM A SHUFFLE, having a screen would be better and im sure he wants to see a screen if he said he wants an ipod, it will make him feel special if u get him the nano i promise|`|Bt3857hxaa	WOW!!! Your a cool mom. I wish my mom would get me something awsome like that as a kid. Gosh...can I have u as my mother please =]|`|a7a505bff23f0d62b51b3a4aac19e750aa	I would get him just a plain old mp3 player, at nine he does not need an ipod. You can find mp3 players on Amazon.com for like 20$.|`|MQ973M96aa	Ask Him.|`|wbytU9szaa	iPod classic = wayyyy too much memory for a 9 year old. I doubt he knows more than 100 songs...get him a shuffle, a nano if you really want to spend money.|`|sSokoG3oaa	shuffle bc they r the cheapest and do not have an lcd screen to break.|`|tbXdgRXpaa	nano. it's simple, and not over the top expensive.|`|2oIB1jAZaa	I think you should get him an Ipod Shuffle. It dosent have a screen but it's has the same use. But if he dosen't want the Shuffle you should get him the Ipod Nano.    Hoped it helped =]|`|t5iWaLvLaa	I would say the nano if you got $150 laying around, on the cheap one  you dont have a sreen or games and it would be hard to get to the right song plus a nine year old would like games, also you could get movies on it for rode trips:)|`|k6PXq9Q7aa	I think u should get him a touch because you can get a lot of different games on them, its really interactive-perfect for a nine year old boy i would know i have a nine year old brother too. Also, ur brother probably doesn't know too many songs so he won't need too much memory on the iPod, and apps/games don't take up a lot of memory. Unless of course he wants to use the iPod for mostly videos-then i would get a nano because i think a classic holds too much memory that a nine year old would not use. or u could just walk by an apple store with him and observe his reactions.|`|AKVQNGcOaa	Shuffle.|`|wv12MI3uaa	I don't think it's the best choice. You can if you want but I think that a nine year old needs that much memory on an ipod. Go on apple store and buy him one of the old nanos that has 4gb or a shuffle. Either way it's an ipod so it'll work out.|`|7f82uwjWaa	Well, since he is only nine, I would probably only get him an Mp3, because they aren't worth as much. You can get one that is like an ipod, with the dial, games and a scroll list, plus it will be like 50$ cheaper. If an Mp3 is out of the question, maybe get him a shuffle or a nano, but 1st generation or 2nd generation. IPod classics are very expensive and could be easily lost, stolen or broken, especially with a nine year old as the owner. The new iPod nanos are very cool, and aren't worth as much as the classics. It all depends on how much you want to spend and how careful your little brother is. Hope this helps.|`|gyXXTREvaa	shuffle!!!!!!!!!!! the kids 9! not responcible enouff for the big boy toyz|`|jxQplnbvaa	get him an i pod shuffle in his favoite color!  they are nice and are hard to loose because it has a clip on the back of it, so when he wants to listen to it he just clips it on and he is ready to go!
QBOtYUGyaa	Unfortunately for you, your hormones won't be "cooling down" until you're much, much older. Right now, you've got some decisions to make.     First off, I believe sex between two people who truly love each other is a beautiful thing - far from an act that "defiles" the body. However, going off your morals, I think you're going to find the relationship very difficult and somewhat unsatisfying with what you want. The simple fact is, we're wired to desire each other.     If you continue your relationship as is and spend time together, when you're alone, chances are you'll do something you regret. Either you need to rethink your morals or rethink the relationship. Forgive me if I'm a little off here, but it worth the relationship if you need a friend around to keep yourselves from going too far?|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Well dont do anything you dnt want to do.   If you and your bf believe strongly in not having sex before marraige then keep it that way.   I understand that things can get a little out of control at times but jst make sure you stay on top of what you believe in.   I dnt think you should have a friend with you because it may b awkward for you and the friend but jst b careful.
943ad7d1a8aed2bd9d670c9644993c66aa	You can bring her birth certificate with you to the social security office and fill in the paperwork for a duplicate social security card.  She won't really need it until she decides to get a job.  So, if that's what you're worried about, you don't really need it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	IF you are paying child support you can call up the place and ask for it, they may have it.   I have to ask this though, why do you need the child's ss number? IF it is to file taxes, you have to make shure it's okay with the mother first if she has custody of the child. There are also forms you have to sign (she has to sign) in order to claim the child if she does not live with you.    You can go to a ss office and request the number but you are going to have to show either that you are father by birth certificate, or paternity papers, and also your own ID.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My husband has had the same issue with his ex! We have court papers stating we get to claim the 2 boys on taxes since she does not work. For 2 years now she has given us the incorrect   for one of the boys! You have to go to the SS office in your area. Please know that before you go, they DO NOT consider a birth certificate a form of id for a minor, yes I was shocked by this as well! Look online and you can get a list of the items  they will accept as id and that you will need to get a copy of the card. One of the items is the 3231 immunization form that is filled out by the child's dr. Trust me you are gonna have to jump through some hoops to get this info but be persistent! Good Luck!|`|8hYKIRWiaa	I would call the government and tell them that you lost the card.  since you have her birth certificate you will have no problem with this.  they will charge (i think it is 25).  this will be the easiest way.  if you tell them that you need the number and that the mother won't if it to you, they might start to question and might not give it to you.  Best of luck|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Try your closest Social Security office. They should be able to help you.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	If you have parental custody of your daughter and are supporting her, then all you have to do is go to your nearest Social security office and tell them you need a replacement social security card. You are allowed up to 3 replacement cards and only up to 10 in a life time. Any more after the 3 it costs( I don't know how much though).    You'll need to bring her birth certificate and your ID showing that your her father and all that.    http://www.ssa.gov/ss5doc/repchildus.htm  http://www.ssa.gov/ss5doc/?ID=rep&Selfch...

rsYbDHWRaa	well clearly any uh.. private parts haha, scream ****. so no to those. i dont personally like eyebrows either, i think it makes chicks look really manly (no offense to anyone though).   you should definitely get a lip piercing! like angel bites or spider bites.. thatd be sick ;D     btw, i like your other piercings! dont listen to like half the people on here. im sure you look rad man :)|`|8hYKIRWiaa	nipples and clit!!!!  so not attractive.  go for the brow|`|fPxUdKZEaa	Vaginal..  Or  Armpit /Under Arm   Gross!!|`|wKsUI9Wdaa	Tounges are disgusting to pierce. I mean, while your eating or something, it's like a little ball in your mouth, EW!  Obviously nipples and clits are just gross and wrong.  I don't like eyebrow piercings because they make anyone who has one look really hxcore.  I think small nose piercings and bellybuttons are cute, though!  Hope I could help!|`|f4AJHCHKaa	I have decided after getting pregnant that I don't like belly rings. I have mine pierced, and took it out, but now I feel like it was such a waste of money. And to top it off I have no stretch marks on my belly except the beginning of one from the side of my piercing. I would say really think long and hard before you get any piercings. If the trend goes away will you still want it?    Good luck on your choice!!|`|CVA86LY6aa	How about you stop now. Your going to regret it later in life.|`|LaiANzeAaa	a penis piercing...think about that|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	you should get a lip ring, they're cool.    Dont get your vagina pierced...|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i think that tongue rings are taaaaaaaaaaaacky. to me it just screams "i looooove sucking my boyfriends/husbans/random guys hoohoos, so i got a piece of metal stuck through my tongue to make it feel better to him!"|`|Jucak0HLaa	Nipples|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Those one right above the lip ( like a mona or something it's called..idk )     They are hideous.

Don't get the eyebrow either....that's just hideous!|`|2OYyljWEaa	I personally think an eyebrow looks really trashy on a girl.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	ANY AT ALL  any pierces no matter where are disgusting|`|ADtfT5L3aa	i think that anywhere other than ears or bellybutton is gross. nose is fine too if it is on the side, not in the middle and a little stud.|`|0xiHNsmVaa	I think all piercings look bad anywhere other than the ears.|`|AA10079820	Any 'private part' piercings.    Eyebrows are very ugly.    And tongues are kinda gross. And people that I know with tongue rings always swallow the ball and stuff like that.|`|6ucVuo10aa	tongue|`|gq5sfgE5aa	I think eyebrows look cool, lips, your ear but kind of diagonally, tongue, and some people have it just above their lip which looks pretty cool too well on some at least. I think a little one on your nose if your nose isn't too big. Bellybutton are good and at the tip kinda of your ear looks good too. I think "private parts" as people have mentioned just no. I think I've covered what I think would look good so have fun choosing!|`|V1hxvQukaa	angel bites (monroes on both sides). those are ugly on girls and guys...
Sa8YH9hCaa	If your 15 I believe you have to wait until your 16 in cali and then you can get your permit  GOOD LUCK!|`|0ypw5nKOaa	Check to see what the legal working age in your state is.

Try fast food chains, grocery stores, etc.. :)|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Wow not many 15 yr olds want a job but much rather hang out with friends (not that that's a bad thing I'm just saying) good for you.

Mi0f4Hufaa	nipple stimulation. i used my breast pump. they told me its like breast feeding so my uterus would contract. i did that along with acupressure on my inner ankle with the first baby and plan on doing it again here soon with baby  2!!!      good luck!|`|wDrhWyUvaa	what
MXXOICquaa	discharge get used to it its gonna change alot it might be thick it might be as thin as water the further along u are the worse it gets in the end u will probable end up wearing a panty liner because you will have discharge bad somedays mine feels like a period it sucks but thats the joys of pregnancy|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	You'll have to be more specific...     If it's not a lot and is more whitish, then it's just discharge... which is normal.    If it was a lot... it could be amniotic fluid...  which is REALLY bad....    Are you cramping?  You should go to your doctor as soon as possible just to be sure.|`|euUZZcM3aa	Could just be discharge, but could also be amniotic fluid which isn't good if you're leaking it. Ask/go to your doc if you're concerned    Good luck and congrats =)|`|2fa52a8e6b6c75385da254c267fc7595aa	I think its urine. I have had 4 children. your uterus is going to rapidly expand very soon if not already. Creating a ton of pressure on your bladder. I leaked urine 20 weeks plus on and off for the remaining time. good luck
sFGgPTk3aa	I have a friend who was having trouble getting pregnant and had very irregular periods.  Her doctor was going to start her on birth control for a few months to regulate and then go off to conceive.  Also works because you can conceive quickly after going off the pill.  I went off in July...had AF in beginning of Aug and then conceived at the end of Aug.  Why not try it?  What can it hurt?  Good luck!|`|eeyGYRcPaa	ortho tricyclen is a birth control pill. i took it for a while when i DIDN'T WANT to get pregnant...seems a bit off to me...|`|2f6diQBiaa	It will regulate your periods, but it won't help you get pregnant (in fact, it will stop you from getting pregnant). Once you stop taking it, it will stop regulating your period. It's a mistake that, unfortunately, a lot of doctors who are not very knowledgeable about fertility make. You could try it, but honestly you will be delaying having a baby for at least 6 months (and maybe longer as your body adjusts after being off of birth control). I don't know how long you've been trying, but I would really think about whether you want to wait this long using a technique that is dated and ineffective. In my opinion, I would just start fertility treatment.     Best of luck to you and lots of baby dust!!!
ggfE4rlvaa	As much as I'm against abortion, they can do it both ways. A pill or a Surgical Procedure. They're called Medical Abortions (the pill), or Surgical Abortions (where they dilate your cervix and stick a long rod up there and suction the baby out). Seriously think about it before you do it..there is always Adoption! It's not something you can take back, and there is a lot of risks with it. Get all the info beforehand, and learn of all your options, please.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Contact your local Planned Parenthood. They'll give you all the information you need.|`|CVA86LY6aa	Why do you feel the need to have an abortion? Why don't you click my profile and email me?|`|GdSzrtmAaa	If you are not ready don't do it!! You can always give the baby up for adoption.|`|2fa52a8e6b6c75385da254c267fc7595aa	both, there is the medical abortion. You can take it from conception on. It costs more. But you take one pill at the doctors office, and insert 4 pills vaginally day 2. laying down for several hours so the pills disolve. Shortly after cramping and bleeding happens. like a heavy period. You feel weak for a day or two but it is in the privacy of your own home. BTW......... those who say you can see the baby, honey pregnancy is formed with 2 single cells. A 7 week pregnancy is barely visable by ultrasound, much less then the human eye.     then the surgical abortion. You can be awake with seditives, or in twilight. In a daze with seditives. It is painful. but shortly thereafter it passes and is over.   Either way I urge you to talk with a family planning counsler, it is free and they can go over your options and what is best for you, providing yoou with support and accurate information|`|GJ0IDpULaa	My friend had an abortion and she took a pill and put inside her and it makes you miscarry. Another friend did it the other way in which they basically pull the brain from the child's head is the way it got described to me. But if your gonna do it the sooner the better cause the longer you wait the it cost . I've got four kids so and i looked at things like this God never gives you more than you can handle. And if i could lie down and have sex then i was willing to suffer the consequences with that. And I was on birth control with each child
S1AuL4SOaa	The generic or dollar store brands only detect high levels of HCG like 100 mIU/mL whereas a ClearBlue or First Response test detects 20-25mIU/mL    Actually the walmart equate brands measure 25mIU/mL so if you are looking for an inexpensive test try one of those!|`|tjgWwfxLaa	hello i wouldnt think it would be negative but you never know i would try a 4 dollar one at walmart if money is an issue.  they have worked for me it always could be you are getting ready for a period though hormones and things like that can cause so many problems
qBFojHLMaa	They make maternity belts that they sell at Babys R us, they run about 15 dollars and it saved my back during my last pregnancy. Mine was velcro so you could adjust it whenever you need to. It worked wonders for me, so I would definately invest in one ASAP!!! As far as preventing it I wish I could help on that one!!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I always like the dog pose for my lower back. Get on your hands and knees and gently lift your legs to the side(like your wizzinglol) and do this about five times on each side..   I saw a chiropractor until 28wks, then I just felt uncomfortable with it... the doctor that is.. but it majorly helped seeing him. Now, I just deal.. and sleep with fifty million pillows.. You can also take tylenol.. if its super bad.. best of luck!
nzY94B7waa	You should be prepared to have the baby at anytime now.  I don't think there is any need to worry.    I just wanted to share with you my labor with my second baby.  I had contractions all day but they were not in any sort of pattern.  Sometimes they were 6 mins apart and then they would be ten mins apart.  So I thought they were braxton hicks.  They then started to get stronger (still no pattern).  I decided to go to the hospital and I was 7 cms dilated.    Just wanted to share that with you because my docs always told me to make sure they were in a pattern or it was not the real deal.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	good grief ! YES you should be prepared to go into labor any day now !    like maybe tomorrow|`|wLG2vjSbaa	Yes you should have the bags packed! Congrats!!! Get ready to welcome your little one in the world any day now!!!
la8W09sFaa	if none of the sperm leaked out you are in the clear, however using a condom that is too big for you means it was not used properly there could be a small chance, but i think it would probably be leaning more towards you being in the clear. good luck, size the condoms next time.lol!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Possibly but there could have been leakage that wasn't noticable at the base.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	As long as none of your bodily fluid leaked out of the condom, she should be pregnant.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	You should be, but be prepared for 6 weeks to pass and she pees on a stick! No way to know for sure until a period is missed or a test is positive. I wouldn't be to worried though.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You should be safe this time, but she needs to be on birth control besides you using a condom, unless you're willing to be a dad.  Condoms by themselves are not enough.  See all the postings in here saying "the condom broke, am I pregnant?"|`|8hwGmfs8aa	hahahaha    ur prob fine....bu accidents happen haha|`|PLgNsOF9aa	You should always , always pull out before you loose your erection. That is the law of the condom.  If there was semen on the outside of the condom even at the base of it there is a chance of pregnancy.|`|Xu1LgjIBaa	I would say you're in the clear.
qN5iVvAFaa	I had that problem with my now 3 year old. don't force him... it might seem a lil awkward, but let him see you go to the bathroom... maybe put the potty chair in the bathroom, and when you go... take him with you, let him see how it is done. that should help. but my 3 year only just got it down. he didn't start actually going to the bathroom in the chair until he was about 28 to 30 months old... all children learn and grow at different paces, good luck!!!|`|dwdLkvgPaa	16 months is really early to start...especial with a boy...I would wait until he turns 2|`|5TvyhgP6aa	Your child is way to young to start.  They are just not developmentally ready yet.  Wait another couple of mos. and try again.  Boys start even later.|`|GPW6HUZFaa	You could try having him sit on it every time you go potty.  That way he can match the sound with sitting and hopefully put it all together and go for you.|`|2fa52a8e6b6c75385da254c267fc7595aa	keep him on it, encourage him, invite him in when you or daddy goes. make it a family affair. he'll get it soon if you can keep it up.   btw........ thats amazing. My son is 20 months and is totally freaked out by the potty|`|oaF2kaXAaa	You cant make a baby go.. in time he will want to use it. When he wakes up from nap with a dry diaper and shows the ability to hold in his wee. Thats when its time to potty train. Boys I've heard are harder to potty train.. its good that you are trying this early, but he may not be ready yet. Just keep sitting him on the chair... someday... it will happen.|`|d5bdc7886fc23eb2e2cc4f9196d678f9aa	I would not worry about potty training just yet. I am a preschool teacher and in the years have learned boys take longer and on average are close to 3 when potty trained. Dont rush him, it will happen. But i do not think he is ready yet.|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	Give him time.  Very few children this age especially boys can get the concept of potty training.  It is good for him to sit on it a few times of day to get the concept... but don't expect much progress for atleast another year.  The average age of potty training is 2 1/2 years old.  Many children are not potty trained until three or some later.  I think this is too early unless your son seems extremely smart.  I worked with many children in my career as an infant toddler teacher, and also as a mom.  I have only seen one child potty train at this age.  She was a little girl who potty trained by seventeen months completely.  She also spoke five word sentences.  She was an amazing gifted little girl.|`|KiWVXdQ6aa	My son was about 18 months when I introduced him to the potty. When he was 3 he decided all on his own he was ready. He's had very few accidents and has stayed dry through the night almost every night since then- He is now 4 1/2 years old. My daughter is 2 years and 3 months and she is in the process- each child develops at there own rate and when they are ready they will do it- just be sure to keep encouraging -don't get frustrated- and have the bathroom accessible for them when they do decide to go. GOOD LUCK!!! he's right on track !|`|74bd27038baf425dcb7dcee5bcc45f1daa	he is not physically able to understand when he has to go to the bathroom untill at least 2...|`|OP2XZJC7aa	He might not be ready yet, but if you want to try you need to let him run around naked.  Keep the house warm and keep a close eye on him.  When he goes to the bathroom, talk about what is happening and take him to the potty if you can make it.  Also put him on at times when you know he might go like after eating or drinking.  Also-- you might want to keep the potty in the room he spends the most time, like the living room.|`|AA11138222	16 months is young to potty train. If he is interested that's great, but most boys wouldn't be. Boys usually potty train later than girls, and sometimes aren't fully training until age 4 or so. At this point I would just encourage him to sit on it if he is interested, but don't get too discouraged if he doesn't use it. Bottom line, he won't do it until he is ready, so pushing him along will just frustrate you :)|`|LlnPkAZxaa	I have been a toddler/potty training teacher for the past 11 years.  In my experience, 16 months might be a little to young yet.  You child has to be ready.  If you force the issue, you will just delay it more.   He has to show interest, be dry more then not and be able to communicate that he needs to go, waking up with dry diapers is a major sign of being ready.  If all of these fit him then he should be ready. Keep up with positive reinforcement.  Make it so exciting for him when he goes that he will love the positive attention and will want to continue with it.  Keep in mind to that boys tend to be a little older to potty train closer to 2 and a half or 3.  You can try with a sticker incentive but it doesn't work for all kids. The best times to put him on the potty would be about 10 mins or so after he eats or drinks, before and after bath time, before he goes to bed and when he wakes up in the morning.  Good luck!|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My answer is that he is way to young to even start this! Most drs. will tell you that a baby/child has no control over their bowel/bladder until they are at least 18 mths. old. My oldest son would sit on the potty from about 14 mths old. However, he was not potty trained until he was 2 yrs & 2 mths. He is the oldest of 6 kids. I have 2 babies and 4 kids between 5 & 9. They were all potty trained by 3 1/2 yrs. old. If you try too soon ( no matter what the reasoning) it may have negative effects in the end and may actually take longer to get them 100% potty trained.
gG8oyymiaa	Yeah I am 6 months pregnant and I am still having sex with my boyfriend. Sometimes it gets a little akward when my belly gets tapped. >.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Unless you're having discomfort with the pregnancy then go right ahead & have all the sex you want. I had sex up until the very morning my labour kicked in....well I didn't know I was in labour at the time but my hubby did say something felt different but he couldn't tell what it was :)|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Unless the doctor tells you otherwise.|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	It's safe to have sex through your whole pregnancy unless advised not to by your doctor.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	bad idea!|`|aSdUzlIiaa	i feel bad 4 your baby|`|IEO6F3TZaa	Yes unless your OB doctor has advised you otherwise.  I would also suggest that you not get carried away.  I think moderation is the right word.  Also choose a position that is comfortable for you.  If it hurts or feels awkward, don't do it.  Otherwise make like rabbits and enjoy the moment.  By the way. . . . congrats on your pregnancy.|`|HCMrR1O9aa	i had sex with my husband through out my entire pregnancy, my doctor actually told me it WAS healthy to do it because of the hormones your body releases when places such as your nipples or other private areas are aroused. also, if your a day or even a week late havin the baby, having sex will help that along in the end...i hope i was help full and have fun, although try some positions that your aren't on your tummy, THAT could be potentially harm full. and if you want to, ask your doctor at the next appointment you have dear...you can never go wrong with that!!!|`|ypJt6poOaa	NO! Don't believe what people tell you...even touching a man inappropriately after 2 months of pregnancy is FATAL for the fetus!!!|`|UOLnp1NOaa	It is safe as long as you havent had any problems. Are you getting regular check ups? If you are and the doctor hasnt said anything about it, then it should be fine. Every thing that I had read when I was pregnant said it was safe untl your water broke. (if you didnt have any problems) but I do know when you are having preterm contractions if you hve sex, it can make them worse.  GoodLuck|`|e7561d2a75135013d4209c1976fc32f0aa	ride that pony|`|2fa52a8e6b6c75385da254c267fc7595aa	yes unless the doctor advised otherwise. and there is no medical problems that would cause preterm labor|`|GJ0IDpULaa	if your dr says you shouldnt have sex then dont but i had sex in my pregnancy all the way to the day before i was due. Of course i felt like a huge cow that was gonna explode but at least when i delivered i was smiling.|`|IFTTsyn6aa	no dont  the baby would feel it in some sort of way  and it can danger your baby when he/she is born so dont  control yourself you horny girl! :)|`|7ZTlktMeaa	Definitely!!!!! It's probably the BEST time to have sex!! Unless of course you are having a high-risk pregnancy. But if everything is normal, then there is no reason to not. & If you're anything like me... I'm 7 months now, but I wanted.... want to ALL the time!!! Pregnancy hormones are crazy! : )     The only thing I would recommend is not laying on your back. It's difficult if that is a position that you & your husband/boyfriend normally enjoy... But you'll be surprised how many other ways you'll find that you can enjoy it. I HATED being on top before I got pregnant. Now I almost only want to do it like that.     Just experiment w/what works best for ya'll & have fun..... !!!|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	you can have sex all the way up til the day you deliver the baby, in fact they say it helps encourage labor. Unless you are on pelvic bed rest, there is no reason at all you can't have sex|`|HBAbSf18aa	Yeah. Completely. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, it's safe through the whole pregnancy. Any body who tells you it's unsafe or will hurt the baby is an idiot.|`|C5ZocttQaa	its one hundred percent safe, unless you are on bed rest, have a high risk pregnancy, or the doctor says any different. its a proven fact that when you have sex during a pregnancy the semon will soften the uterus which makes it easier when it comes time for you to have the baby.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's safe to have sex at any time during pregnancy as long as your doctor doesn't tell you that you can't.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	You can have sex until close to your due date. Have fun!|`|PLgNsOF9aa	If you arent a high risk pregnancy and if your doctor OK's it, its perfectly fine.
5axGfFofaa	I did using the Fertility Monitor. If your considering buying it, I highly recommend it.
IA5zVfk0aa	well, i got tired, i started burping a lot which is gross, i didnt feel like i was going to start my period, but im 10 days late now lol.. that was about it|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	being really tired....being really hungry....exhaustion.....gass.. lol    ummmm    sore boobs, missed period....    everyone is diff some have no signs at all    ohhh but cramping can be a sign..about wen ur period is due|`|nzGdMWbZaa	Typical symptoms are fatigue, morning sickness and sore breasts|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You'll just have to wait and test when your period's due.  Be sure to use your first morning urine.  A lot of women have no signs at all until they miss their period.    You ARE going to be seeing a doctor for birth control, right?|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	About 6 weeks pg you could have cravings, morning sickness, all day sickness, sore breasts, food aversions, sore nipples, peeing a lot, being very very tired.  I think that's about it.|`|yjhpBM11aa	You can get pregnant a week after your period. Every woman is different, some ovulate sooner then others. You always have a chance of getting pregnant if you do not use protection.     Symptoms of pregnancy are:    cramping   implantation bleeding   morning sickness  sore breasts and enlarged nipples  bloating  fatigue     Just keep in mind that pregnancy symptoms are similar to menstrual symptoms. The best thing for you to do is to wait until 5 days after your missed period and then take a pregnancy test.|`|4abdb411c229c6cceec8c8b8258b7cf2aa	tender breasts, frequent urination, missed period.|`|HIn1p4OBaa	shouldn't you just wait and see if you get your period?  and if you are pregnant please please please please don't get an abortion. abortion is murder... murdering little babies.
gEBBpvlFaa	I would imagine that most flight attendants can actually spell the name of their career properly.    Unless you do short hops and work a typical work day (8-5 or whatever), I don't think adoption is a good idea. Kids need their parents. They don't want to be pushed off onto grandparents for days at a time and it isn't fair to ask them to sleep in someone else's home on a regular basis because you are going to be at work.     Enjoy your freedom while you have it. You're young and though you consider yourself "accelerated" (whatever that means), you still have some growing up to do. Do it and don't become a parent at this time.|`|2wyDALHgaa	It really depends which country you try to adopt from because many of them will not adopt to single people.  The other thing you will need to consider is that many of them will not adopt to you regardless of the size of your home, the support of your parents or your finances because you will have difficulty looking after the child.  By that I mean they will want the adoptive parent(s) to be able to spend the necessary time with the child not pass him/her off to a babysitter like your parents for days at a time.    Good luck if that is the way you want to go but I suspect it will be difficult for you, if not impossible.  They will most likely want a parent that can parent.|`|ETcBRko3aa	Learn how to spell first.  You spelled attendant wrong,  salary wrong, financially wrong, etc.    And then move to another country if you want to adopt from one.  Bye.    Oh yeah, it takes ALOT more than "being financially stable" and "owing a 2 bedroom townhouse"  to be a "mom" ~ it takes being there for the child.|`|w5oh9NDfaa	doubtful that they would turn you down, but you must understand that most children for adoption come with needs, development issues.  I would recommend taking parenting classes, they would look favorably on it.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Babies are "not in need". Foster children are. If you want a baby, have your own. Educate yourself about how adoption, especially  international adoption will affect a child.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBydHpfIZ...      http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemo...      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz55snvK_...      http://www.nancyverrier.com|`|BTuFtui3aa	I think you'd have a difficult time of it. Some countries don't allow people as young as you are, or people who are unmarried. Some do, but that will limit your options.    Your career is also going to be a problem, as a single mother. Having one parent who traveled a lot would probably be alright, but having a single mother whose job required such frequent travel... I think it would raise some eyebrows at the very least. Someone other than a parent caring for the child most of the time is not likely to be acceptable.    I would suggest that adoption is not a good idea for you at this time. You're very young, and your career requires you to be gone a lot. Infants take a lot of care, and particularly an adopted child-- with whom you're going to have to work hard on attachment-- is really going to struggle with having you away. I think developing a bond with your new baby would be incredibly difficult when you would so often not be home. I have nothing against working moms, but most working moms can at least come back for a few hours each day and see the child, not be gone for days at a time.    I'll be honest, even if you can find a country that will allow you to adopt, I don't think it would be fair to the child to bring him/her into your life at this time.|`|IP7NPuANaa	No they can't turn you down for that. You need to talk to an adoption agency though, not ask on here.|`|72iIBSDHaa	if you are gone for many overnight stays, it will be more difficult for you. being young and single doesn't help you either. It is possible but you will have a harder time and your odds of a baby are lower.
v7j5fmGQaa	it's still to early for any symptoms..  but if you think about it too much, your mind might start to fool you.   so just try & get your mind off of it & if you period still hasn't started in a few weeks then you can get a test or go to the doctor.|`|XJhiXoDVaa	well one u are not sopposed to smoke it make the baby non healthy and the baby u need to keep safe .|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Wait to take a pregnancy test.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	You have to wait until you miss your period. But you can always pee on a stick;)|`|e7bc222fa0b57adc181abe207a015454aa	Wow, having unprotected sex with someone in the first week, now that's intelligent.  What would ever possess you to have unprotected sex in the first place?  Do you want a nice case of herpes?  There is no way to know this soon, so wait until you've missed your period and then test.  And if u don't want to get pregnant, why not use some protection?  A trip down the condom aisle could not only save you a lot of dirty diapers, but can usually also protect you from a nasty STD.  Be smart if you are going to have sex.|`|J1F3SRJsaa	Oh, pee on the stick you'll feel better. Yeah, it's a little early for symptoms.   OH, Reagan makes some good points, slow down.|`|aruZr146aa	Ey i know what you mean i did the same thing and im only 15 and now im pregnant 9 weeks to be exact it could be anything just wait until your missed period or get a test, worrying only makes it worse and ive been with my boyfriend for a year and 5 mnths so i know what you mean
60a20811e5cbf8f085c0afb72b184e44aa	Implantation bleeding does not occur with most pregnancies. Don't get yourself worked up because stress will cause delay in pregnancy. If you still don't have a period next week then test, but most likely you are just stressing out.|`|yjhpBM11aa	It could be  implantation bleeding. But just remember that some women stress themselves out by worrying about their period being late and they will actually make themselves late. Just relax, take your mind off of it and wait it out. If your period is 5 days late then take a pregnancy test!|`|IA5zVfk0aa	its hard to get pregnant trust me, unless he went in you without one i doubt you are, its ok dont be paranoid, just pretend your not because you probably arent.. dont stress cuz it will delay your period and youll freak out more.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	well considering that none of us were there and not exactly sure what happened, you need to chill out, wait and if no period within a week take an at home test|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	well im wondering if i had that this month too...  i cant test for another week though.  if your period is pretty much due you can take a test and find out..but to be sure wait until the 2nd of feb. xo|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Take a pregnancy test.

qzFnehn5aa	I thought this was interesting and would help you    I was browsing through several pregnancy forums last night and I found something interesting I'd like to share. I've read so many cases where women KNOW they're pregnant, but continue to get negative hpt's and blood tests. Some eventually test positive in their second trimester and some never do. Most of these women are told by several physicians that they just need to face the facts that they're not pregnant. They can't verify it until they demand an ultra sound. One such woman was told she needed to seek a psych-evaluation, meaning...she was a nut case. She refused and got a scan..17 weeks pregnant! These are not isolated occurences. This is happening everywhere, but it's still not discussed or accepted by most of the medical community. These women are getting false negatives due to the "Hook Effect." It happens when hcg is too strong, numbers off the chart and can't be read or translated. When this is suspected, they're urine/blood has to be diluted in a lab in order to get an accurate reading. One case was caused by triplets and hcg was too high. Other medical problems can also contribute. Just wanted to share that and say that if you KNOW you're pregnant..don't allow a doctor to dimiss you. We know our bodies.|`|7C9Ett7Caa	You can get pregnancy symptoms from an impending period. I doubt a blood test would be wrong.. But anythings possible..|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Blood tests are very accurate depending on the timing.    Have you missed your period? If the blood was drawn before implantation occurred (which is 6-12 days after fertilization and even longer in 10% of women) then it could be wrong. I would wait a week or two and take another home test if you haven't gotten a period yet.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	If you missed a period, it's not too early. Honestly, you're probably not pregnant. It could be the flu or PMS.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	when is your period suppose to be, all my test were negative until 8 weeks because of the hcg hormone.. good luck :)
u6K7atx7aa	Are you charting? I would recommend a trip to your doctor if you are not having success after a year. It might be something to do with you, might have something to do with your husband. You won't know until you see a doctor.|`|X0xHXDcTaa	I took the depo shot for about a year, and I have had 3 pregnancies since. I wouldn't think it would cause a problem. You could always schedule an appointment with your Dr to see what could be the cause.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	A midwife gave me a little hint on how to get pregnant after years of ttc and having unexplained infertility.    She said not to orgasm before your partner. The vagina is lined with acid that acts as selective sperm killer. The weak and undesirable are killed by the acid. Having an orgasm before ejaculation draws this acid into the uterus and decreases their survival rate. Have sex with man on top and a few pillows under your bottom. A few seconds after ejaculation try to orgasm. Then have as many as possible. The orgasm causes uterine contractions that help move the sperm to the uterus. Also during orgasm the cervix stretches and pulls the sperm into the uterus. Stay with your bottom on the pillows for at least 30 minutes before getting up.     She swore this works. After nearly 8 yrs with no luck ttc we had 4 more babies using this method.     Best of luck! I hope you get your baby soon. I know how frustrating it is!

kc2Sa7ibaa	I think alot of people, including guys - think it is nasty. Just like how some girls feel about oral sex.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	Its not like he has done it yet    he is letting an active imagination get the best of him    Once he actually tries it(use baby steps like just putting in a little), he probably wont think its that disgusting|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It depends on the guy.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	I don't know, it really depends on the guy.  My boyfriend loves it.  But he hates eating out.  But his friend loves eating out.    It varies I guess.|`|hqSDVWuKaa	it's probably just because it's his first real relationship..... and he'll grow out of it....|`|rsYbDHWRaa	a lot of my guy friends think that, yes. but their all young (13-15)..  most of my older guy friends think its normal and some actually enjoy it.   maturity plays a big part in it, so yeah hell probably grow out of it.. at least the thinking its gross part. some people like doing it, some people just dont. different things for different people!|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	He will probably grow out of that.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Part of it is inexperience.  The more comfortable he becomes with a girl's body, the more comfortable he will be trying new things.      But maybe not -- for example, some guys like blow jobs, but other guys really dislike the idea of someone's mouth of them down there.  And some guys will never be interested in giving oral sex to a girl, while others love it. Different strokes, y'know?|`|k6XRVeJxaa	It's not fair that he expects you to give him a hand job but not return the favor with a fingering. Give him pleasure and don't get it in return? Not fair. He doesn't sound so respectful to me.|`|PAwqjxvaaa	older guys think it's sexy, if this is his first time, he might not know what he's doing, and doesn't want to, or maybe he does and doesn't know what to say....why don't you ask him a bout it....what do you get in return for that handjob?    teach him, guide him......at least that worked for me when i was younger|`|okpAjss6aa	no he will grow out of it or turn gay|`|QBOtYUGyaa	I love it! Don't know why he'd be grossed out by that....    Ask him to try it first. You may want to consider shaving too - many guys like that a lot.
xPR7g0wFaa	Have you gone to planned parenthood?They can help you with any concerns you may have.Best Wishes hun.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Pregnancy symptoms can go away like *snaps* that. They don't usually stick with you throughout the entire pregnancy and if they do they usually taper off. You are fine.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	when i was pregnant with my daughter i was about 5 weeks along and i got un godly sick . i lost weight and couldnt keep anything down . threw up morning noon and night . shes fine and now 15 months old|`|JsshzKM9aa	You're fine!|`|el8yX5q3aa	Stop worrying and stressing yourself out.  THAT is the worst thing you can do.  Symptoms stop during pregnancies...some sooner than others...and if you are like me NEVER!   I was never hungry during my pregnancy with my first one....God..I puked myself to death for 9 months!  The twins...I couldn't get enough food, had no symptoms and didnt' even have labor pains.  Go figure.     My granddaughter just had a baby and she had nothing like her first pregnancy.    There is no bleeding and no pain and nothing else going on...stop worrying.  Feel positive....give that baby good thoughts and good energy.    You say you are having problems getting proof of pregnancy...why is that?  Do you mean you don't have a doctor's say so for insurance or you don't have a positive pregnancy test?|`|xIF2lShpaa	What you are going through is very normal !! Welcome to Pregnancy!! The reason you feel so bad is because your baby is taking everything from you Trust me, they are selfish little things! As soon as you eat or drink anything, they take the nutrients, sometimes not leaving anything for you. Think of it this way, when you eat two meals, the first one is for the baby, and the second one is for you.Not to scare you, as every pregnancy is different, But I was sick the whole time with both of my pregnancies, and I had a 7 lb and a 8 lb healthy as can be. Just hang in there with the insurance thing. As long as you are taking care of yourself, then I would not worry. Stress is actually bad for the baby, and that can harm them more than the sickness, so calm down and get some rest ! Congratulations on the baby! Good luck!|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Try not to worry dry heaves gagging and vomiting are all part of the normal pregnancy symptoms. Some women have it only during part of their pregnancy and some go through their whole pregnancy feeling sick. Buy an over the counter pregnancy test sometimes you can get one for really cheap at Dollar General. Just make sure that the foods you are eating are not greasy or high in cholesterol. As long as you eat healthy keep hydrated and take your vitamins and get plenty of rest you will be fine.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Why don't you just go to your local free health department and have them do the pregnancy test to give you the proof.  And yes this is normal I haven't had any pregnancy symptoms and im already 28 weeks pregnant...  I did have the dry heaves constantly every morning though they drove me insane!  Anyway everything is fine and congrats and good luck =D|`|LDYAGJCxaa	It's completely normal.  Every woman and every pregnancy is different.  You won't always have every symptom in the book, and some women don't have any.  I had quite a few symptoms with my daughter, but when I got pregnant with my son, the closest thing I had to a symptom for 2 months was the need to use the bathroom more often.  They symptoms you're having (or lacking) have no bearing on the health of your baby.  The symptoms are your body's reactions to the hormones.  Relax and enjoy your pregnancy.  :)|`|Z1atdG4kaa	I should think that maybe you're sick? or bad morning sickness? I don't think you miscarried. My cousin has had complicated pregnancies to where she even has high blood pressure causing weird panic attacks...so anything is possible I guess. Try not to worry about it so you don't put stress on your beautiful baby who will come out crying in no time! I would call the hospital and explain your situation to see what you might have if you can't afford a doc visit.|`|nvsVXlBlaa	Go to the E.R and have them take a look at you. Pregency is werid, very werid. If nothing has come out then you should be fine.|`|qgJDdCiHaa	Your baby is probably fine. It's very common to be feeling sick and not hungry, especially in the beginning. As long as you aren't severely underweight, your baby will get what it needs from you. It's just unpleasant for you. It's also common to have it go on for days then stop for a day or so then hit you again. I think it's probably from the rapid change in hormone levels. As for not having sore boobs, that's fine too. I never had sore boobs during pregnancy really, it's always been more like sore boobs after the baby is born and your milk fully comes in.|`|eA93MJj4aa	RElax :) You're fine; have faith and don't make your baby worried; remember that they feel everything you r feeling :)    Blessings|`|rUQAGz9kaa	its normal for certain foods and smells to make you gag ,and my hunger level has definatly went down since ive been pregnant  usually i dont feel liek i cant eat a regular meal since i get full so fast. Im sure theres nothing to worry about.|`|24P6A0oaaa	I'm sure your fine, you should be able to go to the doctors and have them bill you since your going to get insurance.... but anyways, I had no symptoms, I wouldnt be able to tell I was pregnant without a missed period.|`|tZU9k9zNaa	What you are experiencing it totally normal.Your baby is doing fine :-) Just continue taking your vitamins and eating well on most days.Take it easy.Soon you will have your bundle of joy in your hands and all the worrying and stress of having a miscarriage will be gone!!|`|AA10262693	Please don't worry at all! I am 20 weeks pregnant now and for the first 2 months or so I had no appetite and was getting sick all the time.  It was all I could do to keep anything down.  I had the dry heaves so bad my stomach muscles would get sore.  I sometimes still get a little nausea's in the morning.  My doctor assured me that this is completely normal.  I found that my prenatal vitamins were making it worse so my doctor said it was ok to switch to children's Flinstone vitamins.  I just take one in the morning and one at night.  They are much easier on my stomach.  Just hang in there! I know it's hard, but it will get better.  Congrats, and good luck!
XN30YgK8aa	When it comes to baby acne there isn't much you can do but to wait it out. The bumps are ugly to look at but as long as they aren't bothering your baby or become infected you have no reason to fret.|`|q5TchS9jaa	It could be chicken pox. I think you use calomine lotion for that but check with your doctor.|`|AA11625299	there is nothing you can do, you have to let them clear on their own|`|s5i9atFpaa	This is normal and results from natural hormone fluctuations in babies of this age. It will go away on it's own with a few weeks to a month.   Best Wishes to You.
twVyisGnaa	He could've ran away to another city, county, or state.  They usually stay in nearby states, so I don't think that he could've gotten very far.  Hope they find him soon and that he gets the help he needs.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|rDsKB0uXaa	i would move with a friend or a MAGNIFICENT family member|`|kRaVa0Wraa	he can drive right? so he could be anywhere.  you can call the police and put out a missing person report.|`|5FhRoNVUaa	he couldn't have gotten to far.  u should call the police.  his friends probably know where he is,  they're just not telling.  hope they find him soon.  bye mami.|`|AA11509733	he might be over the stateline. who knows?|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	My God your whole family do drugs or something|`|PJYrLxZHaa	I'd try checking out runaway houses, homeless shelters, etc.     Also, keep in mind that his girlfriend and friends may be lying about not knowing his whereabouts to protect him.     I'd recommend calling the police, filing a missing persons/runaway report then begin checking shelters nearby. Good luck!|`|LKnruGu4aa	call the cops
vOomJtbsaa	I'm sure you'll be fine.  My fiance and I bring in about 3500 a month together and our rent is 1200, both car payments together are 800, plus utilities, food, gas, diapers, formula, and about 6 grand in c/c debt.  Our son wasn't expected but boy are we happy he came along.  Believe me we've made tons of sacrifices but we manage and wouldn't have it any other way.  I believe that if there's enough time and love for a child, money will come... it will just happen.  The universe has a way of working itself out like that.   The saying "you'll never be ready"  is pretty true, you just make ready when you need to.  So go for it, it's great to plan but not everything wonderful in life comes out of planning.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My husband & I have 6 kids under the age of 9 and bring in about that much a year TOGETHER! We manage just fine! We do make alot of sacrifices but they are well worth it to see the kids happy everyday! We do receive WIC and free lunch at school for our oldest 4, but no other government assistance! We have NO savings and no payments other then house payment & the typical water,electric, gas, car insurance, phone , & cable bills each month! You should be just fine if you are willing to give up things like new clothes and eating out!|`|rjVALevtaa	Wow, that sounds similar to our situation. My husband made about 36,000 in 2008. In 2007, we made 42,000 but that was back when I was working part time.    He has a credit card debt that is rather large and my car payment is $360 a month. But somehow, we manage.    We have two boys and they're both on Medicaid (I was also on Medicaid when I was pregnant) and WIC. Look into these programs and see if you qualify. From the sound of it, you should.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	yes it can be done we have a family of 5 on 50k. we used to have an income of 100k but we live in detroit and work for the auto industry enough said. but it can be done you just have to watch what you buy look for sales and buy in bulk when things are on sale. shopping for your self like new shoes or an outfit that really isnt needed has to be a special treat.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	You will be fine...Check out all the baby product websites and they will send you coupons for diapers, wipes, baby formula (if you aren't breast feeding)....I worked up until my son was born..I just cut back on all the stuff I bought that I really didn't need  Good luck!|`|X0xHXDcTaa	mmmm, I have 3 and my husband is Army....annual salary ha less than $25000. They do provide housing and free health care though. We make it just fine! Sure you will too!!|`|AhoB10CTaa	i think you will be fine, you'll just have to cut back on spending money on things that aren't necessary like going out to dinner, clothes shopping, etc... my advice for you right now before you get pregnant?? enjoy your free time!!! pretty soon just going down the street to get some groceries is going to become more difficult than packing for a 2 week vacation. good luck!   edit- oh yeah, and if i knew then what i know now, i would have been buying boxes of size 3 diapers like, 2 times a month, just to have a nice supply built up. don't bother buying any newborn or size 1 diapers, seriously, stock up on size 2 or 3.|`|XN30YgK8aa	You should be able to do it but be aware of the general economy ahead of us. How comfortable are you raising a family in a very nearing depression?|`|AA11185954	Oh sure.  No problem.  I have my son on less than that, and 4 well cared for pets.  It all depends on how you use your money.|`|vkQOeDlUaa	we made a little over 50, 000 this last year and we have 3 kids..we buy diapers, formula, baby food, clothing, and everything the kids need and we still have about $900 to throw into savings at the end of the month...So I think your income with one kid is very manageable.|`|a35a45e3355dff894c2ff62e0a85d82baa	We have two (17 months and 5 months) on 47k. We did decide to live with our in-laws to save money to buy our first home. However, it was strictly a choice. We decided to move in when I was pregnant with our first because we had major issues with our apartment manager with mold, a/c, sinks, stove, etc. It was so stressful we both agreed we wouldn't ever rent again. I just want to clarify that we CAN afford to pay rent. But we save it or pay other bills down instead. We're looking at buying in about one more year. I'm a stay at home mom and a full time student. We also have excellent health insurance, car payment, cell phones, etc. We can afford it, but some months (like December) are tight. I have to start Christmas shopping in September. Half of my husband's family (including our two sons) have their birthdays in August so I have to start in April for that. I clip coupons, shop at the 99 cent store, and make stuff from scratch whenever I can to cut corners. We have 2, and we spend about a hundred dollars on diapers and wipes. I breastfeed the younger baby, but we formula fed the first and that was really expensive. So expensive that it is cheaper now with 2 then it was with the one on formula. My husband and I occasionally have to go without in order to make sure the monthly bills go smoothly. I can't compare it to before we had the babies because I made as much as my husband until I decided to stay at home. The baby shower is a huge help, but I would suggest to start saving now for baby. If you feel like getting a starbucks, sock it away instead. That way, you have at least 9 months to have a nice little fund ready.|`|FMQbI5V9aa	how many times are you going to ask this question, 100 times?!

89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	it sounds like deep inside you never believed he would like you annd thats why you are concerned about ignoring him or not because you are conciously  scared that he wont like you if you sing bad and you will never get a chance to be with him which you claim not to care about but you really do(a lot)    My advice...    Knock it out of the park and even make some random eye contact with him every now and then during the solo performance    it will make him feel special because you are getting tons of attention but choose to make a connection with HIM instead of any other audience member    Im sure you are great since you have a solo so just sing, smile, loosen up, and stand and perform as if you are the star because you are the star and he will dig that(especially with the eye contact)    oh and try talking to him after the performance in order to "follow through" with the actions you did on stage    its like a punch/ it will be more effective if you "follow through"    EDIT: Your friend doesn't have him yet and last time I checked she isn't giving him attention out of a whole audience like you could    use your situation on stage to get him because its not everyday you are a star    I mean think of how much rock stars got laid after thier show in the 80s by performing on stage but im not saying you should have sex with him as if he was a groupie|`|hqSDVWuKaa	ignore him, i guess..... i mean, you let your friend have him!!!|`|e81B9pDKaa	Well if you told ur friend she could have him ignore him. If you didn't flirt with him make a move. Or atleast tell him u lyke him. Most peoples friends only lyke the same guy cause' u said u lyked him.|`|cbEOXkugaa	I don't think you should've given up on him. The same thing happened to me. Me and my best friend liked the same guy for four years. He liked us both a little, but I gave up one him because I thought he only liked my friend until later I found out otherwise. Now she has him. If your friend is really your friend she would be happy for you if you had him.|`|PAwqjxvaaa	go for him, screw your b/f, if you like him and he likes you, then make it happen baby|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Considering you already told your friend that she could "have him", it would be a very unwise move to try to get with him. After all, friendships are stronger than a high school boyfirned.    I understand its hard to let go of a crush - just don't look at him at all while you're singing, as it might distract you (especially if smiles at you!). Don't ignore him completely, though. Why can't you guys just be friends? You should talk to him (telling your friend that you have the only intention of being friends) and in fact, perhaps you should invite your friend to the recital as well! It might give a chance for her to know your crush even better (:|`|zjsP15dpaa	I say you talk to your friend about the crush you both have on this guy.  Tell her that you guys will always be friends and you will never let a guy get in between you guys.  So you can leave it open for whoever he may be interested in.  What if he is interested in you and not your friend.  You don't want to cause any unwanted friction over a guy. That's just my opinion on handling it.|`|vF3maPuRaa	i would just ignore him, cause if u focus on him then u could get nervous and mess up on your solo  But good luck tommorw!|`|al4qc3Ywaa	just sing ur solo and if he comes and talks to u then be nice and talk back. i wouldnt completely ignore him cuz thats just rude but if u still like him and u told ur friend she could have him then just be carefull not to be firlty and stuff|`|AA11350792	If you kill the sista he'll pay attention.

Its normal to be irregular at times but if you are really worried talk to the school nurse or have your mom take you to the doctor.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you are young it's not that uncommon to skip some periods but it might be best to be checked out by a doctor.|`|JsshzKM9aa	I did that once before too. Its okay, if you're stressed, have an eating disorder, exersize rigorously, etc. You can miss it for lots of reasons. If you're worried go to a doctor.|`|Ks12fWvpaa	Hello, well first of all your age? If you have just started your period it is normal for it to be irregular for a while. If you didn't just start it, I would see a doctor, for they can check to see if you are a virgin and to see if your pregnant, and if you are neither, what is causing the period problems|`|7YU9IreXaa	That does seem odd.  There is a virus that can cause this. It is however, very dangerous.  consult a doctor immediately.   Or,  You are a slut and not telling us  either way you are going to hell.

In addition to 6 and the oldest child is 7.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Whoever gave her the fertility treatment should be struck off and never be allowed to practise again.   Reputable reproductive technologists count multiple births a failure.  And why were they even treating her?  A young woman who already has 6 children is obviously not infertile.    Is there a husband?     There is no accounting for the woman wanting a seventh child (not to mention 8th, 9th, 10th etc etc) but she obviously isn't thinking straight.   Far from helping her the doctor should have refused.    I blame him much more than I blame the poor silly mother.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Here's my theroy she's going to sell the photos of her babies just like Ashlee simpson and pete wentz did with their son Bronx and get rich that way....lol only logical way for a wacky story that I can see|`|S4pNsW3Taa	I am really sick of hearing this!

I understand some women can't have babies the natural way and need that help but we aren't dogs and don't need to bred like them.   I read she had the option to abort some of the embryos but refused. I don't think it's fair to the babies, given her situation. But who are we to stay, right.   Maybe she had them because she wanted to have her own TV show on TLC like that family with 18 children!   I think in some small way, we need to restrict production, like China...limit 2 per household! haha|`|X83LVP6Iaa	I do not understand how some parents have more than like 3-4 kids. I go nuts with the 2 I have at times..LOL.. But it was her choice to have 8 kids on top of the 6 she supposedly already had. I've heard different stories that she is single, yet some say she is married and her hubby is in Iraq. I do not know what to believe, so I really do not pay attention. When the mother herself is ready to talk, then I'll listen to waht she has to say. Other wise, the rest is all here say.|`|yhpR2gNiaa	I know I will get thumbs down on this but I think that she is very selfish. She had all 8 embryos put in her. And like you said she is single and was in bankruptcy. She shouldn't have had any more children and if she really wanted more children she should have adopted. I too think she was being irresponsible. Sorry if it sounds mean.|`|qKPX3baqaa	Because she is one of those dumbasses who would rather have 15 babies and ruin her life than get an abortion.  I'm not saying abortion isn't bad, but you have to do what you have to do.  And some people say that you are "killing a life" but that's only because they try to be exceedingly religous.     Anyways, that's beside the point...  I guess she just like babies.  The wrong people keep reproducing!|`|PgzZNnLRaa	I believe the woman is a complete idiot and socially irresponsible. Perhaps she has been watching too much TV and is hoping she can get her own TV show like Jon and Kate or the The Duggars.  The 6 kids are 7, 6, 5, 3 and 2 year old twins.  How are they possibly going to get the attention they need and now there are 8 babies that could potentially have health or developmental issues.|`|RzSrsttkaa	this is just insane she is NOT ( nor no one ) is prepared for 14 KIDS!|`|XN30YgK8aa	I am a very pro life women. I don't believe in abortions at all. It has nothing to do with RELIGION at all, it is the mere concept and my own personal virtue. I feel no ill will toward this women for not having selective abortions but I do wonder how a women so broke could afford IVF. I had the pre treatments of IVF and that ran my husband and I nearly 6 grand. Where did she get that money? I would be interested in really finding out more about this women. This whole story is fishy and weird to me. I hope someone else agrees.|`|GpmvgIhJaa	Firstly to the idiot who commented on her vaagina being like a slip slide, they were C-section, honestly do you think she'd be able to push 8 babies out? Geez. Secondly, regardless of how she got pregnant, she and her kids are a burden to society. They are going to be feral. And the Grandfather going back to work in Iraq? Why not take the whole family there? Why stay in America if the family has to be divided just to support them?|`|bpyx92GZaa	This pisses me off. I have no idea where she got the money from but Im sure it cost alot. A million dollars per year to take care of those babies is insane plus she has 6 more kids on top of that....jeeper creepers leapin frogs!! There are so many couples out there would love to have 1. 2 or even 3 of these babies and they cant because it has failed for them and they would do anything on earth to have a baby of there own. This women doesn't work either, well, we know the tax payers will be raising these 14 kids, probably a bigger house, bigger cars and more. At least Mr. Duggar on TV works for a living...lol the guy with 18 kids. I don't know what else to say about this women except I pray these babies survive, have a happy life and that the state don't take them away from their family and if so, the it was meant to be.....:o(|`|1ezYfkX7aa	The story is a bit fishy...obviously they are just being portrayed as broke because they had to have money to come up with to do the ivf....dont know why you would want more kids after already having 6 but thats just me. I also heard that the father made a statement that yes they are currently living with the grandmother but they have a huge house they will be moving into soon....dont know how true that is but oh well.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I read on foxnews.com that she worked in a fertility clinic....so she probably got it done for cheap, if not free....and working in that environment all the time can make women do crazy things....just like the  receptionists at a plastic surgeons office seem to always have a boob job!
AA11616741	No, it isn't. When I had my first ectopic pregnancy (I had two ectopics), I asked the doctor and he said they couldn't. I wish we could have though...|`|rjVALevtaa	No it isn't, sorry. The only solution for an ectopic pregnancy is to have the embryo removed. It cannot be transferred to the uterus.|`|WkaWSKNAaa	No, the pregnancy cannot continue.   The baby cannot develop properly outside of the proper location in the uterus, and your life would be at risk from hemorrhaging.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No unfortunately it isn't. Science has not found a way to detach an embryo from where it implants and move it somewhere else. That would kill the baby. Sorry hun.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	Unfortunately no.
E7ViD8EWaa	=D  That's great!  I'm so happy for you!    She would probably call you aunty, since that's what she's used to you being. Unless you wanted her to call you something else, like mummy or just Chloe, but she might get a little confused.     I'm not in Charlotte's head, though, so I don't know for sure,   but that's how it is for most little kids. =]    You're doing such a great job looking after her, I'm sure you'll get custody! The court would be stupid NOT to make you her guardian.     I hope all goes well!  ?|`|OJtFNjfvaa	Ive read your other questions and it sounds like you really love Charlotte. But how will it affect your school and your career? Will it bog you out for when you wanna settle down with a guy and have your own kids? When your sister matures up about the situation will she want Charlotte back and how will this affect Charlotte if she is a bit older? I guess I don't understand the whole situation but you sound like an amazing person for wanting to take on such a big responsibility and help out your sister. Whatever you do good luck.  Oh and yea she will definitely call you mummy!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	She'll call you what you instruct her to call you, Aunty would be correct|`|6ADvTiS5aa	Most likely she will call you Auntie/Aunt.      But if you keep saying I'm mommy, she will most likely adapt and learn to call you mommy. It is kind of like training her. Hope this helped.|`|krnrjNfmaa	If you get custody of her never ask her to call you mom.  She knows who you are.  Always think of the child emotional state first.    The fact that she will or not is entirely up to her and if she feels comfortable about it.    My husband who are now adults were raised by my husband who is not their biological father since they were toddlers.  They never called him dad even though they love him dearly and feel that he is their dad.    Funny thing is that every time someone asked him about his parents and to their other friends they always referred to him as their dad and never as their step dad.  They still do the same thing today.    Is ok.  Is not really what is important.|`|vwcDdNfcaa	when a child is born they learn the person that has been taking care of them is mommy. she is 2 now and sometimes when i get my cuzion for a weeken who is also 2 will call me mommy because she see's im taking care of her. as she gets older you will need to explain why she is "going to be your child" and if no longer going to be with her mother. i think you need to give her the choice she is 2 i think she is old enough to somewhat understand so be honest and open with her you can refresh in a few years on the story but just be a mother to her no matter what she calls you. she prob will say auntie where is mommy or stuff dont say im your mother now just break it down from her. overtime she will relize mother=care giver, loving, helping, understanding, loyal, and tried her hardest and once she sees that in you it can go to mommy but for what ever the reason she is going to be yours let her know you love her and will never leave her. best of luck and hope all works out.|`|KM6PDz5qaa	if it is your sister's baby, then she will call you as Auntie.or Aunt. or whatever goes as Aunt..|`|EKoRHgdgaa	Auntie or Aunt, probably.  :o)|`|EgLTmiTjaa	i dont think she'll call u ma until she gets used to u playing tht role but in the meantime if you do get custody just be sure to be her ma even if she doesnt call u it...gud luck|`|bql2RJzWaa	You're not her mom. She should be calling you aunty.|`|ojVl4Gowaa	She will call you mom, always. My closest friend was adopted by her Aunt at age 5 (mother refused to believe she was sexually abused by her boyfriend, she married him after my friend was adopted). Because she was raised by her Aunt she calls her mom, and her mother has tried to contact her the last few years but she calls her by her real name.     She will see you as her protector and nurturer. She will know you are her 'Mom' and call you that all on her own.    Edit: Okay, whoever thinks two year olds are set in their perceptions of the roles of adults is insane. Your niece is still so young that she will form all her motherly memories with you, not your sister. It's all in how you act and bond with Charlotte. Before I married my husband my (now) nephew pissed his family off by calling me Auntie around age 2. No one ever told him I was his 'Auntie' (because they didn't want me to be!) but he saw me in that role and assumed I was his Auntie.|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	She is still young and if you are adopting her and being her mother then she will most likely change over to calling you mummy,mom,momma whichever you and her prefer. Children naturally want to call their female nurturer mom.|`|6jECbxIeaa	Most likely she will still cal you aunty..she will slowly call you mommy when she's ready, but that it up to her...      I'm glad you are doing this for your niece!!|`|dTLTNZTzaa	She will call you mommy - trust me. And you don't even have to tell her to do so.   I was taking care of my cousins daughter for 3 years - 2 years old at that time (cousin was out of country). Kiddo used to call me by my name, but once in a while she had this urge to have her mommy around , so she would call me mom.   We always watched photos with her parent on it and I would always tell her - "This is your mom and dad", we would talk to them on the phone, but still - since she was spending all the time with me she would call me mom.   She is 14 now, and does not remember all the things we did together and our time together (remembers some things), but loves me a lot and always happy to spend time with me.   By the way - used to call me mommy even after her mother returned for about 2 months.|`|zx1g1kdsaa	She will call you what she is comfortable with. she will let you know when she is ready to call you mommy, but then again she may never be.|`|XN30YgK8aa	Well it really depends on the situation but you have to realize your niece is already two years old. She has a concept of who you are and that won't change over night. Also, the legal system will be very reluctant to allow an aunt to adopt a niece by CHOICE. There has to be more too this and if she was an unfit parent she would not have custody of her child...hmh. This question is fishy.
mWZE7gF7aa	I know that I couldn't fit in my pants by 7 weeks.  Everyone is different and your body is changing...it doesn't necessarily mean you are having twins, the weight gain could be your breasts having increased in size, the pants not fitting could be from losing your waist which unfortunately we all do when we are pregnant, even well before we begin to show...    You are fine.  I have seen women who were having twins who didn't even BEGIN to show until 20 weeks...all women are different.  Your body is always going to look huge to you and those close to you because they are not used to it!  Your doctor will tell you if you are gaining appropriately.      =o)  Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|rJ7QfQ0Raa	ive gained three pounds my whole pregnancy and im 28 weeks. it just depends.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	this is something you should be talking to your doctor about. some people gain alot and some people dont.. for me, i've gained 50lbs and im only 24 weeks and my doctor says that everything is ok,,,,

rjVALevtaa	It should fit pretty well. I have an Evenflo car seat for my son. In comparison to other brands, the Evenflo seats are relatively small. Assuming this is your first baby and you can put him/her in the middle of the back seat, it shouldn't be a problem.     I don't have much experience with that sort of car, but I do know that most newer cars (2000 and up) do have a latch system. Try putting down your backseats and looking for the hooks. And yes, you can use the latch rather than the seatbelt.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	read your car manual, it will say if you have LATCH. Also, on your vehicle seat there should be a small picture on the back of the seat and if you reach underneath between the back rest and the seat you will be able to feel the hook.     Evenflo makes the crappiest infant seats There are lots of recalls, mainly with the carrier part detaching from the base. It would be better to go with Graco, they are a lot better. The snugride goes up to 22 lbs and the safeseat will hold a baby up to 30 lbs.    If you don't mind not using a carrier for baby, The First Years True Fit convertable carseat is a GREAT buy. It rearfaces 5-35 pounds and then can be forward facing up to 65 pounds. You won't have to buy another seat until your child is between 5-6 yrs old. Email me, I have LOTS of info on carseats|`|XN30YgK8aa	If you have a latch system depends on if your car is stock or not because in 2000 the latch system was not stock, it was upgraded.
LDYAGJCxaa	It is normal to clot during your period.  But usually gray colored clots do suggest a miscarriage.  I would see your doctor just to make sure it wasn't.|`|eA93MJj4aa	Make an appointment to see your doctor.  YOU had some labor symptoms; a miscarriage is like going into labor.  HOpe everything is fine; but remember you need to get checked :)    Blessings|`|0cd614f1916fe3a0e7e55c61e721edc5aa	Sounds like an early miscarriage, but it could be something far more serious. See your doc, immediately.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would see a doctor. A brownish grayish clot could be something more serious than a miscarriage. It could be an infection or worse.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Not necessarily a miscarriage,did you ever test positive for a pregnancy? It's a possibility,but most likely not. I would see a dr,who may want to do an ultrasound,to make sure,and see if it was a miscarriage and make sure everything's cleaned out.
wziUVyVoaa	I like Kari Rhynne best. It's less common than the other two and it's both the first and middle names have cool spellings.

QEL5dZfuaa	this almost exact thing happened to me and a very close friend. let me give you a quick background to make the advice more clear. :)  i was friends with this girl. i said the simplest thing to another friend of ours and he twisted the words somehow. soo she got mad at me... for about five months. we turned out ok but it's somehow different.    well the entire time i remained peaceful. if it were not for my attitude about this, we could have ended up in a bit more than what it was. i think it's great that you want peace. that's all i personally ever want. just know that it is very important for you to keep the peaceful thinking with you at all times. some people can be hard-headed and misunderstand your intentions. stick to what you know and what you know is right.    the letter is a great idea. i actually did this with my friend. like i said, hard-headed, but it loosened her up enough to see my feelings. you have to remember to keep calm and conciderate in your writing. mine turned out to be 6 pages, hand-written. it is a very good method of getting someone's attention. i highly reccomend it. write it out on paper, and don't use myspace or e-mail or something. hand- writting it really emphasizes the importance.    it really stinks when people get in the way of a great friendship. in your case it was your friend's bf and i think it's important to concider is talking to him. see if he noticed any changes. and see if he really was the one to change your friend.    best friend relationships are the toughest things to lose. it's not right when people change like that. the only thing we really can do is let them know we are there for them and try to show them that they aren't themselves.        i hope i helped! good luck! :)|`|kRaVa0Wraa	a note sounds like a great idea.  i did the same thing with a friend i missed, but i sent it to her facebook inbox instead.  but when you're writing the letter remember to be super-sensitive and try to put as little blame on her as possible, or she really WONT talk to you ever again.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	I think a note would be good, but also just letting her know that you are there for her.  Friendship should be reciprocal, but at the same time when you add expectations to it (like wanting something in return) someone is bound to be disappointed.      She is obviously going through some life changes and maybe she needs to hit rock bottom before she sees what she is doing to her life.  This is also when you just need to be there for her.  You don't need to approve of her lifestyle, but just lower your expectations of your friendship.  Hopefully some day soon she'll come around.    Also, if you write a note.  Make sure you are telling her how you feel, not how she makes you feel.  If you tell her "how she makes you feel" you are placing blame on her and she may get defensive.    I hope that I don't sound like I am on her side.  I have been in your position and it sucks.  I hope that your friendship can heal.|`|c1q3lWtlaa	well, you could try the note but at some point you're going to have to sit down and talk to her. don't approach her with anything heavy. it would be best if you just opened a normal dialogue with her and eventually, you may be able to talk about the stuff that's been bothering you. if you come out with your concerns straight away, you might scare her away and this would not be conducive to your cause. maybe you could try to reestablish your casual friendship and then move past that. take it one day at a time.|`|11rr5EZOaa	Write the letter don't use e-mail  or face book. make it personal and don't sound like you are lecturing her. But remember that it may not work so don't get your hopes up. I commend you for being a good friend not a lot of young people would still be wanting to try and help her. I wish you all the luck in the world trying to help her.|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	i think a note sounds like a great idea, jsut don't mention anything about ehr boyfriend, her pills, or that anything of it is her fault, just say how much you miss her and how much u miss spending time with her. she'll either turn around or just ignore it but whatever happens, know that you did all you can and tried your best. and even if she does ignore the note which i hope doesnt happen, when she reads it, it will always be in the back of her head, she'll think deep and hard about and even if she doesnt come around right away, it might eventually make her realise. anyways, good luck. =)|`|69K4WoSoaa	The note is a really good idea. Most people that are in "love" dont see things from other peoples point of views. So when you do write her the note. DO NOT MENTION anything NOTHING about her boyfriend. Just tell her you miss her. NOT the old her, just her ingeneral. If you do this note mention nothing of him. When he going to complaining because she is spending time with her friends, she will see what a douche bag he really is. But you dont want to bring him up, she will have to see that for herself that he isnt the best thing in her life. Good luck, I hope that helps!!!!|`|CcXgTPUTaa	i think the note is a pretty good idea. althrough i'd perfer talking in person tho. i'd say go to her house and talk to her. i mean she can't not talk to you with her parents around rt? it's not lik she can kick u out of her house or anything. but sometimes somethings are easier on paper than talk. If u are writing a note tho, i suggest that u don't put your name on the front just put to:_____ then just start the letter and on the back side of the paper put ur name because since she thinks ur friends excludes her, she might just rip it up. also, write about the happy time u and her both had together
nrQhVcy7aa	that girl is really going to get teased. i feel so sorry for her|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	You should look like a prune by now.  I really hope you are just trying to be funny and arent serious about putting a person through that kind of torture.  The names would be fine seperate, but together it is really way too much.|`|fboC1N7gaa	It's a pretty name, but it has a LOT of L's.|`|50cpycM8aa	i think its a little much, not a bad name just too much alliteration.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	It is too L heavy, unfortunately. How about Leola Louise Larmstrong? Still L heavy, but not as bad. Leola is pronounced (lee O lah). It is the feminine form of Leo.     I do give you props for spelling Lee correctly for the correct gender.|`|6jECbxIeaa	WAAAY tooo much...What's up with Lee Lee Lola?    Too much alliteration..  it's kinda a bad name|`|MgVsTOidaa	way to much, think about ur baby when she grows up, u dont want her to be picked on.|`|Zu3UijP4aa	ITS A CUTE NAME BUT SHE WILL PROBABLY GET TEASED BECUZ OF HOW LONG IT IS...AND BECUZ OF ALL THE L'S|`|D848UxVBaa	Kind of a tongue twister!  How about Leola Louise Armstrong- much easier to say.|`|LgLpJxnwaa	i will shivel up and die XD  hahaha  good one.  Lee Lee Lola Louise Larmstrong.. different.    yay 2 points.
nrQhVcy7aa	no way! jazz is for jasmine|`|UzkHnXzVaa	I'd give him a longer name so he has something to work with when he's an adult. Jazz is a very cute nickname (I have a two and a half year old cousin named Jasmine and we call her Jazzy/Jazz... Jazz could also work for a boy), but think about when he's forty years old. He's not going to want a cute name then. Think about him using the name Jazz in various professions... doctor, lawyer, etc.    Why not go with a longer name that you can use Jazz as a nickname for? Sorry, but the only suggestion I have right now is Jasper.|`|TX9igTWraa	you should call him jasper and jazz as a nick name.|`|GPDmgs67aa	hell no!!  what do you want a girl or a boy?|`|Yy4RCOnVaa	please dont give your child a stupid name like those crazy celebs!  classic names are so much more....well, classy.|`|DYzX2I9uaa	It could be short for Jasper. (if its a boy of course). for a gurl.
tGf4SUFuaa	There is nothing to be worried about!  An infant reaching these milestones, especially early, is a wondrous sign!    Usually she is not able to hold her head like that for at least another month and a half.  As for the walking, that usually isn't until the child is almost a year old!    Your child is way ahead.  This is a good sign!  She may be very intelligent in school too.|`|Lr3lZ4draa	my son started doing that when he was 3 weeks old.   hes even rolled over a few times (including at the doctors office) and every ones saying he shouldn't be this strong and advanced at now 4 weeks old but its a really good thing that he is.    so don't be worried. you've got a "prodigy child" as my boyfriend would say|`|dTLTNZTzaa	Mine tries the same - it is good and normal, but please watch her - she is still fragile and needs support.|`|AhoB10CTaa	no way, don't be worried. you should encourage her to build her back muscles! do tummy time after every diaper change, my son is 5 months old and he was like that too at that age, i think it's pretty normal actually.|`|AA11625299	my daughter has been holding her head up since she came home from the hospital, shes almost 2 months and she also stand w/support....her daddy holds her and she steps like shes walking...why would you worry?
JsshzKM9aa	If its positive, its positive. Congrats. :)|`|biKMQ2I1aa	sex=possible pregnancy  even on birth control  even on your period|`|eL7iWXWKaa	ANyone can be pregnant|`|tZEOtpGpaa	Yea it could be possible.|`|AA11757270	unless the pregnancy test she took specifically state that they are not affected by clomid, then it could be a false positive.  On the other hand, she could really be pregnant.  The only real way to find out then is to go to her dr. and have the ultrasound done to see.|`|fee80ea1112f0f01af4280757ecf8929aa	i hope she is. (:
YSbCVt3Uaa	Jordan|`|WMem5AGoaa	Drew|`|6LYE2VlCaa	I like the name Drew best out of the two.    I have a young female cousin named Jordan so that name has always seemed more cute and feminine to me.    During middle school I knew someone who was never afraid to speak his mind and was a strong individual. His name was Drew so I naturally associate those characteristics with that name.|`|Dr6nCsZ3aa	Drew.|`|SgKsHxD5aa	jordan ftw|`|6wIfS0b9aa	Drew is a hotter name than Jordan.  Jordan reminds me of this girl that made me get lice in second grade...TORTURE|`|bvt9kvS8aa	Both are nice|`|4WjB4tHjaa	Jordan|`|hqSDVWuKaa	jordan, i think, from a girl's prospective.... lol|`|2YI7LMH3aa	both of them are good :)|`|e81B9pDKaa	I lyke Drew better|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Jordan|`|ZYUpEdcqaa	Jordan definitely.

MHhFMdWoaa	Kinsley Grace :)  .....whenever I hear Kassidy, I think of David Cassidy :/|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	I like Kassidy Grace, Kinsley sounds more boyish|`|ej51eWO7aa	KASSIDY GRACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THE NAME. IT IS MY BFF'S NAME.|`|auRHZadYaa	i think kassidy grace souds better|`|9lvybFqNaa	I like Kassidy Grace    I LOVE Kinsley Grace!!!!    = )|`|7drjpohUaa	I LOVE Kinsley Grace. I don't really like Kassidy Grace because I have a friend who's last name is Cassidy so it reminds me of a last name. Kinsey is a very beautiful name and it's not a name you see often. Congratulations!|`|H1UzYl8haa	kassidy grace  gorgeous name|`|6jECbxIeaa	Kassidy Grace    Cute Name..And Grace is not that popular...|`|76Wp8OINaa	I like Kassidy grace, I love how you spelled it with a K|`|By1DJAUOaa	I hear Cassidy a lot so i like Kinsley b/c it seems unique|`|UzkHnXzVaa	Kassidy Grace gets my vote.   Go with whichever name you feel is best though. :)|`|vZToCRVuaa	kinsley.tinsley|`|fALkYOC1aa	both of them are very pretty...  but- i like Kinsley Grace better :)|`|EvgSMTjnaa	I love Kinsley!|`|9wS0LxjLaa	1 for sheezy.....|`|PzrVrlW4aa	I like Kassidy Grace better.|`|32K93DP4aa	kinsley grace|`|JHfxwDsqaa	I think Kassidy Grace sounds better|`|zjsP15dpaa	Kassidy Grace is very pretty.|`|RnKFuUGPaa	kassidy grace :D xD|`|z8WIAhDVaa	Kassidy, i've always adored that name! it's a great name!  Be happy with whatever YOU chose.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	I do not care for either, but Cassidy Grace, with Cassidy spelled correctly is much better. Kinsley is masculine and a boy's name.    Have you considered Grace Cassidy?|`|q5TchS9jaa	Kassidy is better.|`|UQdqzLgfaa	i like kassidy grace.  And grace is a beautiful name.  not only is it a family name, but it is also a strong name, yet still very ladylike.  She's going to be beautiful.  God Bless!|`|iWcXFF38aa	Both names are unique, but Kassidy sounds like a cuter name for a girl.|`|bb0a55c9173c16dcac954fc0cee8992aaa	Kinsley Grace by far!     Kassidy (Cassidy) is being used quite frequently these days. I happen to love Grace and used this as a middle name for my first born.      If you are looking for alternative suggestions, then perhaps go with Kinsleigh Grace or Kinslee/Kinzlee Grace to be even more different.     Hope this helps! :)|`|v8Shukwbaa	Kinsley Grace, Sounds very unique:)  Very good choices!|`|sajJeZvgaa	Kassidy Grace is much to common.  Do you want your kid to a be the banana or do you want it to be something more than that?   Kinsley all the way to home base, it sounds cuter and just all around better. Trust me.   Your little kinsley will appreciate its name later on they'll ask you what other names you were thinking of an you'll say   "Oh well Kassidy," and she'll be like "Ew! Thank god you didn't name me that mom!" and you'll say "We almost did" and she'll say "What changed your decision?" and "You'll say Yahoo Answers!"     (:|`|NnatPbU7aa	Kinsley is nice ... Kassidy is a ghetto spelling.|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	Kassidy Grace|`|MgVsTOidaa	thumbs up for Kassidy|`|Ks12fWvpaa	I love Kassidy grace! Its beautiful. Bu both names are beautiful so I would consider both and both would be great, but personally I like Kassidy|`|Icll803gaa	I def like kinsley grace! i never heard that name kinsley.. The name in whole sounds like she shoould be star :)  I Love it|`|39dqBmoiaa	Kassidy Grace|`|Sz4YQAYoaa	Kassidy|`|AUJPwvUwaa	Kinsley Grace.    so beautiful. i love the middle name Grace
vOomJtbsaa	No it's not rude, as long as you are discreet it should never be an issue.  You have a right to feed your children in public, and your children have a right to eat in public.  If people have issue with it than that's their problem.  You are providing a wonderful, natural service for your babies, keep up the good work!|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I think as long as you cover up your fine.  Also try to find a less crowed spot (like a not so busy end of the mall or something).  I'm totally for breastfeeding and find it a wonderful naturally thing, but this day in age there's going to be people that find it offensive and rude unfortunately.    Also, I know alot of places now have family bathrooms that also kind of have sitting areas for nursing mothers.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I do not think that it is rude to do it in public as long as you are covered. It is a natural part of womanhood. Your babies need to eat and anybody who can't understand that is just plain rude. Go ahead and do what you need to to take care of your babies!!|`|wFVLP5l3aa	no i defenetly dont think its rude or nasty  i breastfed my son wherever we are when hes hungry the plazas the best because it has speciel rooms for it but if theres nowhere private ill sit in a corner and descretly feed him  but we dont use a blanket because its way way too hot here|`|rjVALevtaa	No, I don't think it's rude. I applaud women that are brave enough to breastfeed in public. And I applaud you for breastfeeding twins!     I only wish I had not been so modest when I was breastfeeding. I used to feed my son in the car and hope no one noticed!|`|6jECbxIeaa	It's not rude, there's nothing wrong with it, but I never did it because I thought that I would look informal or indecent...Do you kinda get what I'm trying to say???|`|kcGFK36Waa	its not rude and its legal.|`|AA11795652	I breastfeed everywhere in public.  I have a nursing shawl which is basically a light blanket with a snap to go around my neck so it doesn't fall off.  I don't like pumping and I don't always plan ahead when I go out so I have to breastfeed my baby.  Although I like to think that people would understand and I do get the nice smile from other moms when they can figure out what I'm doing, I'm still surprised by the dirty looks from some people.  I'm fully covered so it's not like people can see.  I would go for it if I were you.  I have never breastfed my children in a bathroom because I don't eat in the bathroom.  I have breastfed in a women's sitting lounge right outside of the bathroom and on rare occasions I might go to the car to breastfeed but that's not for the sake of the public, it's just cause I wanted to.  I have even sat down in the middle of a department store and breastfed while my mom and sister brought me clothes to look at so I could shop and feed my baby at the same time.  Good luck on breastfeeding in public and I hope no one ruins it for you!|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	If bottlefeeding a baby in public isn't "rude" or "nasty"  than neither is breastfeeding a baby in public.      But, no matter where you are you will always come across certain individuals who are so filled with ignorance, and overcome with their own insecurities..they make take it as rude.  But you just remind yourself, what a great mom you are..and that bfing is an amazing gift to your children and forget about any of those people you might come into contact with!!|`|kdSuwt8paa	Breast feeding and rude don't belong in the same sentence.   However - there are occasions and places where it may be inappropriate.    If you are in doubt you can say to hostess or whatever "Is there somewhere I can feed the babies?".     I actually found it quicker to go somewhere quiet when they got older, because they were too distracted in company!  When they were tiny nothing distracted them!  I often see mothers sitting on benches in shopping centres, outside in parks and malls, on buses and trains and in cafes feeding their babies.  I think it is important to keep yourself covered because some people aren't used to seeing it.  Other than that go for it!|`|rymbwVKXaa	First of all there is nothing wrong with it. You eat while your out and I feel its the same for the baby. Many places out there like in the mall have nursing areas. I think if you cover the baby with a blanket there is nothing wrong with it. I have twins. I breastfed to about 16 months. I always did it in public. You can always try it and if you don't feel comfortable with it don't do it. Its always a personal choice. Good luck!|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	No it's not rude. I don't feel it's necessary to be excessively obvious about it though.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	i do not think it is rude at all. you can discreetly nurse in public.|`|XN30YgK8aa	Not rude at all.|`|AA11625299	no its very natural...I would recommend investing in a hooter hider...you can get them at walmart, target or even on ebay...it covers you while you feed    http://www.target.com/gp/search/175-5810...|`|QQI4rliYaa	EHH NOT THE BEST THING but if ur babies need it well there hungry do what you have to do..kids and family come 1st|`|R62kIKIxaa	Absolutely not. I never breast fed my son in public I would pump before we left the house but it is perfectly natural so I don't see anything rude or nasty about it.|`|HGUoCE1naa	nope been there done that !!!|`|6FPpkmi6aa	No it is fine, just make sure it isn't completely exposed. People don't want to see you feeding  your child (maybe perverts do) so you have to be careful. Also do it where there are a decent amount of people so that someone won't try to grab you.|`|tGf4SUFuaa	It's mostly what you think of it, how you feel about it.  You have a legal right (at least in the USA) to breastfeed in public (with or without a blanket).    Personally, depending on the situation, I would forgo the blanket.  That is what a breast is intended for.  There is nothing to be ashamed of!|`|MslcyESfaa	I agree not rude at all! You have every right and if you are covered and do it discreetly than you won't offend most people. In fact with practice you will become so discreet some people won't even notice! Good luck!|`|X83LVP6Iaa	I see nothing wrong with breastfeeding in public. If you are hungry out in public, you eat right? So if your baby is hungry, and breastfeeding is the way he/she is fed, why not feed the child. Just my thoughts. I breastfed my second child and plan to do the same with this one, however I never got comfy myself with breastfeeding in public. Not that I couldnt do it, just thought someone would see my boob that I obviously do not want others seeing. LOL So no I do not think its rude or nasty. Babies have to eat too.|`|8RH2DaHYaa	if you are covered correctly, then its not rude at all. and it doesn't matter what others think because your sons health and well being is much more important.|`|yhpR2gNiaa	We eat in public and I think our babies should be able to eat in public too. I do think you should cover up with a blanket (like you said), but I don't see why it would be rude.  Just my opinion.|`|TklfCPh6aa	Alot of people have strong opinions on this subject. I personally think there's not a damn thing wrong with breastfeeding in public. We watch (and let our children watch) violence on tv every day...what's wrong with the human body and what's totally natural.   Cudos to you for doing it and for doing it with twins!!|`|jYPeis3Saa	no its not rude.  who cares what other people think anyway.     i never did it because im not comfortable with it for myself, but i have absolutly no problem with other moms doing it. the baby has to eat too right?|`|cqgWkdPtaa	no way is it rude!! go ahead and do it, its a LOT more convinient that using a bottle in public (especially if you have to express to get it!)|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	I have no problem with mums that do it discretely but there are some mums out there that think its totally acceptable to just "flop ur tit out" anywhere anytime and i find that abit too much. Theres ways to do it and ways you just shouldn't.
kiAQi91laa	You need to tell your parents or just your mom.  You need to make sure that you wasn't raped by going to a doctor and getting an exam.  If it turns out that you may be pregnant, get the clothes you wore when you had the dream and see if you and your mother can file a report.
TE7foNwMaa	Well, it depends what your opinion on popular names are.... Aaden / Aiden is the number one name on the popularity list of 2008...     Tristan is number 19. So they're both pretty popular, with Tristan slightly less.     I personally like Tristan...only because I know way too many Aiden's, but only one Tristan. Plus, all of the Aiden's I babysat were kind of "brats gone wild". One even managed to break a bouncy ball in half. The Tristan I knew was much nicer and much easier to watch. So I'm a bit partial to the name.    So my vote is for Tristan!    But if you really can't decide, you could always wait until he is born. Once you seem him, you'll definitely knew which of these is his name. :)    -- Amy|`|VHHis05Naa	Tristan|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I like both names but I really dont like Aaden spelled that way.  It looks really stupid to have two A's like that.|`|us1ca2qIaa	Trestan is the way to go.|`|AA12339451	I like Tristan.  TRISTAN   Gender: Masculine     Usage: Welsh, English, French, Celtic Mythology     Pronounced: TRIS-t?n (English), trees-TAWN (French)  [key]     From the Celtic name Drystan, which was probably derived from drest meaning "riot" or "tumult". The spelling has been altered by association with Latin tristis "sad". In Celtic legend Tristan was sent to Ireland in order to fetch Isolde, who was to be the bride of King Mark of Cornwall. Instead, Tristan and Isolde end up falling in love. Their tragic story was very popular in the Middle Ages, and the name has occasionally been used since that time.|`|Elxuvon8aa	sorry neither both are on every ones list so way to over used|`|bS6RPi9saa	if u really love both then both then lets say if u really like Aaden then pick Aaden Tristan or the other way good luck!|`|3E1o6Xzwaa	Aedan|`|zhL83fSlaa	Tristan|`|P6NptCz8aa	I've never met a guy with either of those names who didn't smoke way too much pot and listen to lousy music.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	Tristan would be called Triss or Trish, I'd go with Aaden|`|fboC1N7gaa	I really like Aaden.  Tristin can also be a girl's name and means Tumult while Aaden means little fire.|`|W4Dek41Jaa	Aaden, if I had to choose.  But I don't really enjoy either of them.  Doesn't Tristan Remind you of Kristen? Which is a girls name.|`|AA10453678	i like tristan|`|xIF2lShpaa	If you cant make up your mind, then use both of them. Aaden Tristan or Tristan Aaden . If you ask me though, I like Aaden. I don't know why, but I have always loved that name, and if I ever have a boy, then I am going to name him that for sure!|`|oU4L01s0aa	neither!|`|t043WEDIaa	I love the name Aidan but only with an i not with 2 a's|`|gew4KVFfaa	i love the name Tristan! go for it|`|9e446fd9db4d9ad99d9a59fab5cbb25aaa	DEFINITELY: Aaden|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Tristan is a little too feminine for me. Aaden is stronger, although i prefer Hayden.|`|QhP6oe9haa	Traeden. ^_^    or both...    Tristan Aeden...|`|24P6A0oaaa	I like aaden, my son's name is kaden....so ya!|`|2XTkSV4daa	Aiden (I like this spelling the best, because Aaden has too many "a"s it's weird) is much better because Tristan sounds too much like Kristen, for a girl. I think that one sounds so cute! Don't listen to your friends and family, you are the one that should make the decision.|`|r5Psh5Doaa	aaden!   cute name!|`|rUQAGz9kaa	aaden if its pronounced like aiden , the name tristan kind of reminds me of those little crackers .Im sure thats not what it reminds everyone of though.|`|TX9igTWraa	love aaden! but you should drop one A|`|SUWxxF85aa	hmm tough for me to say..i think that i am judging it to much on the tristan and Aaden i know..the tristan i know is very kind and caring and always likes to make people feel as though they fit in and the Aiden i know is very smart and great at drama and maths and very strong minded.. i hope your baby lives a healthy and happy life xox|`|pmiKJGJmaa	um... Aaden... but spelled like Aeden!|`|wziUVyVoaa	Both of them are very nice names. Ultimately, it's your decision and no one else's (except maybe the baby's father lol). They're both beautiful and I love them. The only thing that sucks is that you can't use them both together because it would sound weird with the ending syllable.    Tristan Price  Aaden Presley  Tristan Keith  Aaden Joshua  Tristan Jarrett  Aaden Rae  Tristan Morris  Aaden Riley  Tristan Brady  Aaden Gunner  Tristan Cole  Aaden Samuel  Tristan McKenna  Aaden Derek  Tristan Nicholas  Aaden Christopher  Tristan Cameron  Aaden Blake  Tristan Joel  Aaden Shawn|`|d6ANFdZ8aa	Tristan!  I love that name!|`|DdTVq00laa	Tristan sounds nice :)|`|HGdQp8QBaa	I love Aaden!!! It makes me think of someone sweet and intelligent!|`|CcXgTPUTaa	Aaden|`|cmdAsz2iaa	I like Aaden James. Could be called AJ. That's what i'm naming my boy.|`|Jcyv1gpEaa	Tristan is much better.|`|WiLstRwKaa	I know someone with both names and they are both cute. But I would go with TRISTAN.|`|bb0a55c9173c16dcac954fc0cee8992aaa	I really like the name Tristan. You could also spell it Trystan, Trysten or Tristyn.  Aaden is different, and so far I have only seen it spelled Aidan.      Both of these names remind me of that movie with Brad Pitt (who played Tristan) entitled "A River Runs Through It" and Aidan Quinn was his brother.    Congrats on your baby boy though.  Hope this helped! :)|`|wPn56kjDaa	I like Aaden, especially with the spelling. It's unique. You don't hear it a lot, and remember, you don't want your son to be 1 out of 3 or 4 ______'s. Good luck on whatever you choose.  Congratulations!|`|GaZscBiBaa	Aaden.... Definately|`|AA11173065	i like tristan but it depends on your last name too cos the initials TT or TB or something like that would be kinda silly imo :p|`|ZGMsI5ykaa	Definitely Aaden! I love that name! Tristan sounds like a rich, stuck-up, forceful name. He sounds like a pretty boy! Haven't you ever seen Gilmore Girls?|`|O4ysbdwVaa	they are both girls names|`|AUJPwvUwaa	Tristan.    Aaden is becoming too popular.|`|9wS0LxjLaa	Hate Tristan And Aeden??? Isnt it Aiden....|`|LgLpJxnwaa	Tristan all the way.  If you end up going with Aedan please spell it Aiden, alot nicer.
14pjwQPLaa	Well from 2 - 9 IS a long time to hang out at a mall (unless it's the Mall of the Americas, in which case, it's not NEAR enough time!)  Try compromising, and perhaps stay from 2-7:30.  That way, you'll be home long before your curfew -- which will surprise, shock and please her and give you brownie points for the next time!  Hanging out at a mall for 7 hours is just asking for trouble from bored teenagers.  Or, give her an itinerary:  Say, "We're going to shop from 2-5, have dinner, and then go to a movie at 6:30, which is over by 8:30," so she won't think you're just wandering the mall looking for guys.     PS:  There's no sense in getting mad at you for your friend's mom being late to pick you up.  If she's that worried about getting you home by 10, she needs to come pick you up herself.|`|hqSDVWuKaa	1) because it takes time to shop, we want to check out the whole mall and get good food and good shopping done!  2) i'll call you and let you know EXACTLY when we're leaving the mall, i might be home a bit after 10, but at least you'll know that i'm with them and that i'm SAFE!!!!  3) i'm going to be with a few friends and i have my phone with me and other people are in the mall, we'll be safe
73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	What worries me is that she is failing in her schoolwork and being punished for it instead of helped. Someone should go to the school and find out what is going on instead of blaming each other and grounding this child for weeks on end. That is crazy. Instead of extra curricular activities someone should be sitting down with her and going through her homework with her and finding out what the problem is. Someone needs to sit with her every night and make sure her homework is done. NO 7th grade child has the self discipline to regulate doing their homework. That is the parents job. I used to make my children a snack and they used to sit at the kitchen table and do their homework as I made dinner. They got it done and I was close enough to help if needed. They didnt do other activities including watching tv until it was done. I suspect she is having trouble at school...either with the work or with bullying. Probably the work is too hard for her or she has fallen behind and that is why she isnt bringing it home. That and the fact she gets away with not bringing it home. You have to be consistant with children...not have a cow when her marks are not good in her report cards but following up every day and after every test. She might need a tutor instead of the extra curricular activities. I know she likes them but she needs to be brought back up to speed as she will go even further down as she goes to high school if she cant do the work now. SHE isnt old enough to be responsible for this...that is the parents job. She needs understanding not grounding and help not 'discipline'. And no child needs or deserves to be punished for something she cant do or understand. That is just abusive. And not for that length of time either especially at that age. Not supposed to play with friends...sheesh...that is sadistic. The parents need to be grounded if you ask me. She needs help and guidance every day so that she can learn and have confidence at school.|`|AA11284138	Nice of you to care for her. I have no experience like that because I am not married but, I had experience with my sister. I tried to enforce rules while my parents let her loose. What happened here when she was completely out of control? she moved out herself, my parents cut the cord, and now she lives on her own even though she wants to move back. But the terms were once out, no back in (and somehow they have managed to keep their word).  Well, of course my mom is her never ending debt free piggy bank, but at least she is now kind of growing up. But again, not having you any authority over her, I guess all you got is to wait. Unless you can influence on the school she goes to, because that's what messed my sister on my parent's nose. I told them to enroll her at my old high school, but no, let her go to the "getto" where all her some married, some pregnant, some already with a baby junior high friends are going.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Have you tried a tutor?|`|Gkf0dWYdaa	Dont be a Biatch lady i mean honestly even if you cracked a whip on her back she probably wont learn let her learn from her mistakes not the wicked old stepmother|`|ceE9aNg2aa	I'm glad there is somebody who cares about their stepchild. Sorry there isn't anything that you can seem to do. Maybe she'll realize soon enough how important schoolwork is.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	What a hard situation to be in.    I think you need to sit down with your partner and tell him how much you love his daughter, and how much you want her to suceed and be happy, and at the moment she is not doing this. Offer your help in discipline ideas and moral support but if he dies not want your advice there is not much you can do!    Be her friend and try to explian the importance of an education|`|bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	sit her down and have a casual talk with her. Tell her that you want her to be happy, and her education is key to that. If you throw in a story about you being unmotivated about school then changing, she might be more keen on listening.|`|ngeBdq3Maa	Take her computer, ipod, everything else away.   Each day try and help and encourage her to do her homework.  Tell her how much of a success she can be when she grows older.|`|cHR21nnVaa	Instead of grounding her, maybe take her to a soup kitchen 1 sunday and both of you work there to help others in need and maybe seeing that environment for the less fortunate as well as those who've given up and just maybe she'll see what so many are trying to tell her! Otherwise utilize something that will let her see and feel what the alternative life is like for so many and she may turn a corner.    Good luck.|`|ORy1HG0yaa	You are wrong to say that you have no control over her discipline. You are the step parent, yes, but you are still a primary authority figure in her life. You and your husband both need to set some ground rules. Speak to him first about it. As an idea, you could try:    1. No going outside/over to friend's houses until her homework is done. She has to show you, don't take her word for it.   2. No extracurricular activities until her grades are back on track. period.   3. No allowance/cell phone/computer until her grades are back on track. period.     You and your husband have to agree to enforce the rules, or else she will not learn. Please start right away! You do not want to rob this girl of an education!  I wish you the best of luck!|`|JVHCFXXVaa	If they can't do anything YOU can. Be her friend and YOU encourage her. She needs a reason to care about her life and if they can't provide it maybe you can. Be her friend because it sounds like she could use one right now. Failing twice in spite of *punishment* she's trying to get attention and maybe help in the area she failed. See if you can find a way into her world and create a special bond that will give her a reason to care about her life and future. Even in small ways. Leave her little notes giving her a boost or a compliment. You might be surprised how small things can go a long way but it may take persistence on your part.Try to be the person she can rely on to be positive in her life.|`|DRTM8M07aa	Well, I was actually the same way as your stepdaughter when I was in Junior High - failing, just wanting to hang out with friends, rebelling against my parents, not thinking/caring about my future... It was pretty bad. Now, I'm 16, a junior in high school, and I have a 4.0  average.  I kind of wish this was coming directly from one of her parents so I could give them some advice... I'm not a parent, but I am a teenager, and I know what makes my peers tick. The trick is to not get her into too much trouble - replace the harsher discipline with care and talks about her future. Because - if you think about it (at least this is how I see it and did see it at her age), when you take things away (i.e. cellphones, computer, video games, TV, time with friends), you're taking away her sources of happiness and the support of her friends. Parents do this thinking, "Now she has no choice - she has nothing to do BUT her homework." Wrong - what I did when I was restricted like that was wallow in self-pity, become severely depressed, cut myself... I actually did even worse in school. My [smart] parents realized that they couldn't force me to do better by being homework Nazis. What they did was, instead of taking absolutely everything away, they only took a couple things away, and they started to ask me seriously about what I wanted to pursue as a career. I told them I wanted to be a psychiatrist, and they told me to be a doctor, I would have to go to college, and to get into college I would need good grades. They talked with me about it often, without anger, they talked to me like they really believed I could do it, which kept my mind on my goal, and began to bring my grades up. Now, I'm in a really good place, next year I'm applying to Stanford Medical School.  I would say to try doing this with her. Even if it doesn't work, it can't hurt. I'm guessing that because 90% of the girls I knew when I was that age, she probably wants to be a fashion designer or something like that. Make sure she knows you have to go to school for almost every profession. And even if she just wants to be a cashier at a boutique or something, let her know that she might not want that in the future and should not limit herself by getting bad grades.    Hope I helped! :]
WHClrBHRaa	if this girl isnt gunna go out with you cuz she cant. Dont bother with her for now seriously and ask the second girl out she might be better for you anyway. dont let anyone put you on hold go for it now.|`|t93uTYK0aa	date the 2nd girl. then date the other girl if that opportunity arises in the future.|`|KeT55QP4aa	go out with the one girl that wants you to ask her out if ur single next year then ask the other girl out. date as many girls as u want untill then|`|AA11745717	go with the second one itll make the first one want u more ;)|`|838VJJGvaa	You are too young.  Just forget about it.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	13 year old boys don't need girlfriends! They are too immature for one!|`|EriaXXVWaa	Sneak out with her ;)|`|AmKRIR2uaa	Ha, ha. If the first girl is truly interested in you enough to wait, and you feel the same way, return the favor. Don't go off with someone else. That might cause some unnecessary drama in the future. Keep in mind, though, that either girls' feelings towards you could change considerably quickly. You never know what might come up. Not to sound discouraging, though.     All this said, sounds like you need to take the time and think about which person would be better suited for you, mainly personality wise. Then again, it's your call.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	Which one is better suited to you, personality-wise? I think that if Girl  1 trusts you enough to wait a year for her then you shouldn't be running off with other girls. If you do date Girl  2, even if Girl  1 *says* she doesn't care, she'll feel hurt and betrayed that she isn't the apple of your eye. You can't get both girls. Stick with the one you really love.|`|IEQNX4Hxaa	well you cant have both obviously, so your just going to have to make a choice of which girl you like better. think it out carefully before you make a choice though, just so that you wont have any regrets that you cant fix.    i think that by the girl telling you to wait for her to turn fourteen means that she doesn't intend for you to date other girls in the mean time.    by the way dont toy around with relationships, get to know these girls first okey?
w2uktQyBaa	I would suggest you just go buy a test, I know there can be bleeding but it wouldn't be your period.  Most likely you wouldn't be showing much or if at all.  But if you do have your period you are most likely not pregnant|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you think you are 3 months pregnant you need to take a test to know for sure. You can have period like bleeding in pregnancy but it's usually pretty light. Take a test.|`|0ImXbZTjaa	yea u still can...u may want to go to the doctors to make sure|`|627pWyVkaa	you need to take a test asap! It gets hard at times to "suck in your tummy" if your pregnant. And you wont get your period if you are pregnant but you can get spotting and implantation bleeding, which you might assume is your period. But please test, IF your that far you defientely need to see your doctor for health care|`|pIOPhLp5aa	I don't think you can get it through pregnancy. Normally && you probably can suck your tummy in but I don't think it would be a wise choice to do.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	my sis had her period throughout her whole entire pregnancy and i had mine til about 4 months pregnant.. it is possible!!!!   just go to your doc..|`|5aKUV5afaa	If your worried about being pregnant and you also want to suck your tummy in, it tells me you are hiding this from someone.  If you need to hide your pregnancy, fine.  Please know that you can drop off any newborn to any hospital, police station or fire station with no questions asked.  None.  Also, you can go to any Planned Parenthood and they have many options for you.  It's all confidential.  No one has to know but you and those who you chose to tell.  Good luck to you.|`|sF3UyQsIaa	some women do, and some women dont. each pregnancy is different. relax and grab a test. if you are 3 months, it should come out positive if you are.|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	No you can't get a period when you're pregnant. You can have bleeding when you're pregnant but it is not a period and likely wouldn't be coming at regular intervals like a period. Most  women don't show with their first until 15+ weeks, so you might be close. Why do you think you're 3 months pregnant? A test would have given you a definitive answer 2 months ago. Get some at a dollar store. No one on Yahoo answers can do the job of a pregnancy test.
