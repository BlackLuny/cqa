20080706193214AAxPmvn	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do I make them stop making remarks about my weight?	Okay so basically lately I've been like working out a lot and eating more healthy in better porportions.  So as a result, I think that I might have lost some weight.  Like I haven't weighed myself on a scale because we don't have one and I would prefer judging myself on how my body looks and feels than on a number.  However, my thighs have slimmed down and so has my stomach.  Now I personally have always been pretty thin.  Normally I am like a size small in shirts and 5 in jeans.  But lately since I've been thinner and I've been trying to eat healthier my family keeps on saying "Are you anorexic?!" and "Stop starving yourself!"  But I'm not starving myself, I'm still eating a lot! And like yesterday these people got me pants that didn't know my size,  the pants were a size three.  So my family told me to try them on and I went and did, and they fit really good! I had also noticed that my pants were starting to get a bit baggy and I keep having to pull them up. So when I showed my famil

20080930013941AAq1Eg4	Health;Mental Health	Does this make me mad?  Serious answers only, please.?	For as long as I can remember I've had these rituals and I am recently wondering why I do them and if it means I might be technically clinically mad or something.      For example, when walking down the street and listening to music on my iPod, I will see a few metres in front of me a 'milestone' such as a particular paving slab or shop window, and will try to reach that point before whoever is on my iPod gets to a certain word in the song.  I don't start running but I do sometimes speed up walking to get there.  If I manage it, I feel a small victory (like: I am going to have a good day today, or something small like that) but if the music 'beats' me, it's like a small loss (I might feel like I'm going to have a bad day or that my diet won't work, something relatively minor like that).  If this is making you laugh, I assure you it's deadly serious.      There are many other things, too, but this is the one I've noticed myself doing more, recently, and as I mentioned, I've done it for as long as I can remember.      Another one is that if I am on a train or tube platform and I hear the train approaching, I will fix my sight on a milestone (a particular paint marking on the platform, or a discarded newspaper) and I have to get to that point before the train reaches the same point on the track.        Does this make me mad?      Thanks for any and all serious answers.

Comenzaré mi historia diciendo ke soy un joven normal, no busco tirarme ninguna clase de flores, sinembargo también algo guapo (no soy la gran maravilla), el punto es que soy amante del rap, y esa música gobierna mi vida y mi filosofía.   Y es presisamente por eso, que un buen día deje mi ciudad para ir a una vecina, donde me encontré con unos amigos (junta que tenía prevista hacía unos días), y pasé ahí un tiempo.   Conocí a una chica y con ella pase un peque?o periodo antes de volverme a mi ciudad.   Le dejé mi número móvil y el de mi casa, para que me llamara de vez en cuando.   Ahora bien, voi al grano.   Comenzó con llamarme 2 o 3 veces al día.   Siguió incrementando kizás hasta unas 5.   Me pidió ke fuera a visitarla, y lo hize un par de veces.   Sine,bargo ya comenzaba a aburrirme, llamando TODO el día TODOS los días, llegé a evardir sus llamadas no contestando...   Y así estuvo llamando TODO EL DIA SIN CESAS HASTA QUE TUVE QUE CONTESTAR EL MALDITO TELEFONO.      No contenta con eso, me continuó llamando todos los dias, a cada rato, en todo momento y lugar.   La mayoría de las veces era para decirme -Hola- y -?Que haces?- para despues quedarse en silencio.      Un buen día le dije - Hey ·&"·6·%& podís dejar de llamarme por la misma "·$&·$ !!??- i dejó de hacerlo...por unas horas.      No aguanté más, i la volvi a mandar a la punta del cerro.   Hasta ese punto, alguien con condiciones mentales normales dejaria todo intento conmigo.   Sinembargo ella no, llorando me enviaba mensajes al buzon de voz llorando, me pidió ser su novio por teléfono, i contunuaba con su maldita insistencia.   Ahora me envía mensajes diciéndome te amo, etc, etc.   Y me llama, me llama, LOGICAMENTE NO LE CONTESTO, pero me TIENE LOCO, ME LLAMA DE 8 NUMEROS DEFIERENTES, APARTIR DE LAS 7 AM HASTA COMO LAS 12 PM !!!!!!      No tengo como sacármela de encima, muchas veces le he dicho que la corte, ke no kiero nada con ella, pero no hay maldito caso, demonios !!!      Que santa ennfermedad tiene esa chica !!! AYUDA PORFAVOR , NO SOPORTO MAS !

20061006054601AAI07q9	Health;Diet & Fitness	What, other than being out of shape, causes a high resting heart rate?	My pulse is fast all the time, even faster when I do cardio. At first, when I started keeping tabs, I thought it was just a sign that I was no longer in good shape and that I needed more exercise. I have done cardio from 30 minutes to an hour at least 6 times a week for the last 6 months and figured that would help lower my resting heart rate but it hasn't budged at all. Any ideas?

Sono stata vegetariana per 8 lunghi anni e oggi soffro di una terribile anemia sideropenica (da carenza di ferro) nonostante mangiassi legumi etc..      Non è vero che si può star bene senza mangiare carne.   O meglio,lo si potrebbe essere spendendo la bellezza di 8 euro per 10 flaconcini di ferro (1-2 boccette al giorno!!) a vita.Oltre a questi soldi dovete aggiungere quelli per le pillole di acido folico,vitamina b12 e vitamina C.      Ripeto: Non si può essere vegetariani e stare bene. Ve lo dice una che lo è stata per motivi etici e che a causa di questa scelta,ora si deve curare.      Per i vegetariani: fatevi un esame del sangue (ferritina e sideremia) e poi ditemi..

20090130153022AAS67Zh	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Can a multivitamin/can of diet caffeine-free sprite/blood pressure medication affect a blood glucose test?	I am currently studying abroad in Mexico. Over the past few days, I have had dry mouth, fatigue and occasional tingling sensations in my hands and feet. Until about 6 months ago I was morbidly obese but have lost about 140 pounds since undergoing LapBand surgery. I had my urine tested for sugar while I was at my highest weight and the test came back negative. Despite my weight loss, and the negative test result, I always worry about diabetes. Today I went to a (reliable) clinic and had my blood-glucose levels tested. I was not referred by a doctor, but I took it upon myself to fast. I had an orange last night at about 7:00 PM and then nothing except water, a can of diet sprite, a multivitamin and my blood pressure medication (Atenolol, 50mg) until my test around 11:30 AM. The result was a normal 78 mg/dL, so my fears have subsided for the time being. Just curious as to whether or not anything I consumed (or the fact that it was nearly 17 hours since I had eaten anything) could have impacted the results. Any answers are appreciated, though I would prefer a response from someone with a medical background. Thanks all.

Im a 15 year old female with no cancer running in my family exept prostate cancer (which obviously doesnt effect me). So i have a question, because my bowel movements have changed a lot in the past 3 weeks. I usually go every day but 3 weeks ago, i felt really constipated and didnt go in almost 6 days. Then, after that it hasnt really been the same. Ive had to push harder (sorry if im grossing you out) and i dont feel completely "empty" after i go. I am going every day again, but it also seems like i dont poop as much. I havent changed my eating habits lately either. On occasion, ill feel a dull pain in my abdomen area when im trying to poop. But its not that bad and it goes away after. I dont have blood in my stool or anything though. So from what i have read, those are signs of it. Im a little worried and i wanted to know what you think..? PLEASE dont say "go to the doctor" because i really would rather not until i know if im overreacting. So could you tell me what you think this possibly could be and if i should be worried? Thanks =]

My 17 year old daughter started suffering from severe headaches 9 weeks ago and they have not stopped.  One docter put her on Vicodin (didn't help; just made her feel weird).  The neurologist put her on Relafin and Soma.  The Soma helps her to relax so that she can sleep at night.  But, the medications have not rid her of the headaches.  They ruled out migraines.  CAT Scan came out normal.  She gets an MRI this weekend.  In the last two weeks, she's had "seizure-like" episodes (when she's coming out of a sleep).  I've not been present to witness.  She describes it as being fully aware of her surroundings, but unable to control what's happening.  Her muscles completely constrict and she can't move.  Her jaw clenches and she can't cry or scream or call for help.  When it's over, she's able to get up and come get me, but after the episode, she's exhausted and her headache intensifies.  The ER doctor said it's not a seizure because if it were, she would not be around of her surroundings.

Giusto ieri sera mentre stavo uscendo dalla Coop dopo aver fatto la spesa scorgo nel mezzo dei cespugli un portafogli riverso, un pò sporchino(era uggioso a Bologna ieri sera)ed ancora pieno,c'erano esattamente 25€ cartacei e 1,52€ in spicci,compresi i documenti in una taschina laterale,carta d'identità, patente,tessera sanitaria etc..    - ammetto che l'idea di tenermi i soldini mi ha sfiorata per un attimo poi però ho subito pensato:  a) per 25€ non mi pare proprio il caso. b) una buona azione fa sempre bene, a me almeno cambia l'umore. c) non ci sono più persone così e farà sicuramente piacere. d) è come vorrei che si comportasse la persona che troverebbe il mio portafogli se mai lo smarrirò.   Non ho mai avuto così torto in vita mia, vi spiego: lessi l'indirizzo e notando che era vicino al supermercato mi avviai col sorriso stampato a riportargli l'oggetto smarrito, risultato: sulla soglia di casa ha avuto il coraggio di accusarmi che mancava del denaro!

I have this annoying problem that when I either run or do any type of excercise my face breaks out in hives.  That is one of the reason I stopped going to my gym and I just started running by myself and excercise at home.  I miss taking those kickboxing classes at my old gym but I found it embarrasing walking around with these welts on my face.  They do go away eventually (about in an 1 hr).

I really want to get buff, not like incredibly big or ripped, just enough to impress some girls and to put on weight because I am 18 and only weigh about 150.  If I were to drink protein shakes and not lift, would that help me gain any muscle at all?  Or do I have to lift in order for the protein shakes to work?  The only weights I have are curlers and that is a start I guess to have with the shakes to get my arms big, but what would happen if I only drank the shakes?  I guess the question I am basically asking is what do I have to do to get buff FAST?  Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks.

20090130163908AAlk6pl	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Question about... Please help?!?	The day before yesterday (Wed) I got bit on my ring finger by a stray kitten (4 months old tops) at school (it was stuck and i 'rescued' it) well, I scruffed the cat (like your supposed to do) and right when I put it down, it bit me 2 times- both bites happened in not even 4 seconds.    Well, as soon as that happened I put the cat down and I made the bites bleed, a LOT, and I soaked it in peroxide for about 10-15 mins while I got my stuff up to go to the nurse. Up at the nurse's office, I soaked my finger for like 20 more mins. It started to swell a few mins after the bite and the swelling's gone down a LOT.    Yesterday, I went to the doctor because my finger was a little warm to the touch and the bites looked like they were starting to get infected. I'm on antibiotics 2x a day for 10 days and I also got another Tetanus shot (had one 2 years ago).    I can move my finger just about like I normally could, but it's still tender.       Any thing I could do for it like soaking it or something?      And, I'm not wanting a scab to form now because since it was starting to get infected, the scab would close in the infection..

20090130182328AABnmGQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Does it sound to you like I have diabetes?	I've been needing to urinate about two or three times an hour (used to be more frequent, like every 15 minutes) for the past 1 1/2 months. Sometimes I don't notice it (or maybe I just don't need to go) and can go a couple hours without peeing, no problem.      When I pee, there is no burning sensation and I have no trouble with it coming out. I also never have to wake up during the night to pee, nor do I wet the bed.      I got the results of my blood test back early this month (I'm going back for additional tests in a week).      My cholesterol was 125, my blood sugar (fasting) was 83, and my A1C was 5.7      He said that the ONLY thing that MIGHT indicate pre-diabetes or diabetes is my A1C because it is "high normal", but he still doesn't think that's why I'm peeing a lot... my urine samples showed I don't have an infection or anything like that.      I don't have any other symptoms of diabetes though - no extreme thirst or hunger, etc.      The only other symptoms which I think are related since they started around the same time as the frequent urination is occasional excessive gas (I'll fart like once every 10 seconds, lol.), occasional lower back pain (This is actually more frequent, I feel it a lot when I'm sitting up in a chair or something... nothing to cry about though...), and rarely, a mild/moderate pain in my lower abdomen.      Thanks a lot in advance to everyone who answers.      I'm a 16 year old male, by the way.      I'm 6'1", 180 lbs. Athletic... no serious prior health problems...      And that 180 lbs. has been consistent for the past couple of months now, give or take a few pounds.      I haven't been losing any weight (another symptom I heard...)

My mom and I are like best friends and I feel I can talk to her about almost anything but for some reason this subject I can't.

My boyfriend and I are more than a hundred percent sure we're ready to take our relationship to the next level. We've talked this over with eachother about a million times and he thinks it's a very sensible decision for me to use Birth Control. I just wanted to know what some of you think is the best way for me to bring the subject of me wanting Birth Control up to my mom? Also what Birth Control do you think is the most used or the best for more protection? Some people have told me Yaz is good.  My boyfriend is also a virgin. We're both not really nervous but excited. Is that normal to feel that way your first time? The more I think about us having sex I get nervous though. Is their anything we can do to help with the nerves?

20090130164614AACZ0eN	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	My fiance is worried she has lymphoma?	I calmed her down a bit and convinced her she was probably making a big deal out of nothing, but I still figure I'd ask.        She has asymmetrical tonsils, her right one is almost twice the size of the other, and the lymph node in her neck is swollen. She has had an off and on loe-grade fever of about 99.2 for the past week or so. She sweats excessively at night. During the day she'll be freezing so she'll grab a sweat shirt, then she'll have to take it off because she starts to sweat. She'll sleep 10 hours at night, but when she wakes up she's still tired. She's lost 15 pounds in a short amount of time. Her throat doesn't hurt, but she says it feels like it's closing up on her. Our bed is pretty high off the ground and this morning she went to get out of bed, and just completely fell on the floor and she said she couldn't feel her leg. The only other thing is unexplained msucle soreness, she doesn't work out or lift weights but her legs and back are sore.      I told her that all those are symptoms for MANY other things besides lymphoma, but she's convinced that she has it. We called the doctor and he doesn't have any openings until late February (we made an appointment anyways), so I'm taking her to the minute clinic tomorrow morning before her first class.

I posted a question on the optical forum regarding a delivery issue with eyeglasses from an internet source. An optician with the handle footprintz got on his high horse and berated me for buying eyeglasses from a foreign source, specifically Hong Kong. What footprintz did not say was that virtually ALL eyeglasses in the US are made in China and he and his brethren routinely mark up eyeware approximately 1000%. That's one thousand percent. Once the public gets wise to this, do you think brick and mortar opticians have any future?

It was not for anything just because i had not had one in ten years. I am 26 and a pretty healthy person and have not been sick in any way in close to 15 years. It is Friday and i am feeling bad pretty much all over. They told me the arm in which i got the shot would be sore but said nothing about the rest. I am a very energetic person and always have been but since Wednesday i have been exhausted. My shoulders are sore, my legs are sore, my butt is sore, my ribs are sore, and my back is stiff as a board and i have never had back problems. I have shortness of breath and every so often get a tunnel vision effect and feel very weak. My arm pits are even hurting and it is really uncomfortable to hold my arms at my side because of my arm pits. The soreness almost feels like a hard workout after not working out in a while. I just checked my temp and it is a 101.6. Are these normal side effects or something out of the ordinary?

I did not sex in about a year and a half, until last night.  I've had a boyfriend for 4 months and we decided that it was an appropriate time to have sex.  However, it hurt REALLY bad.  It felt like I was a virgin all over again.  Today I don't feel pain but all day I've felt like my insides are "uncomfortable" - (I don't know how else to explain this.)  Is this normal?  When we did it, we started out slow but after I got past the pain (it took about 10 minutes) we had rougher sex.  My boyfriend is about 8.5 inches and I felt a pinching stabbing pain way up inside when we had sex.  I just hope I'm not "injured" on the inside. And I hope next time we have sex I won't have to go through this pain!  Can someone tell me if this is normal?

20090130195227AABBsoV	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	My sore throat is different than I've ever had it before..?	Almost a month ago, I received antibiotics for an extremely sore throat. I quit taking them 2 days early because they were creating havoc in other areas, and the symptoms came back, so I took the rest and it went away. Then it came back again, so I went back to the doctor (different doc because it was a walkin clinic) and he said it was viral so he couldn't prescribe me anything. I am not convinced it's viral, but it's getting so bad, but the symptoms I have are weird!      It almost feels like I have canker sores on the very back of my tounge, but I've prodded around back there and don't feel anything. The base of my tounge hurts when I stick my tounge out or curl it back in my mouth. Last night my throat hurt so bad when I swallowed that I was up at 2 in the morning bawling my eyes out, took 4 ibuprofen and managed to fall back asleep. It didn't hurt this morning, which surprised me, but now it's the evening and it's coming back and I'm afraid it's going to get just as bad tonight.      Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've been sick for almost a month now, and I'm getting really frusterated! Not to mention my 18 month old head butted me in the middle of the night and I have a nasty cut on my lip that rubs against my braces so I can barely eat! I'm just a wreck!! Can I get anything to treat my throat??

Over the last two years or so, I've been very gradually losing my hearing. As it stands now, I will probably be completely deaf within the next six months. I have been going to doctors, of course, and have ruled out brain tumor just recently. I am going back in a couple weeks, but in the meantime, I've been doing some of my own research and my symptoms sound, to me, like Mienere's. (Vertigo, oscillating hearing loss, over-all balancing issues). My question is, if you have been diagnosed with Meneire's (or know something about it), does it seem likely that this is what I have, and is there anything that can be done to at least save what little hearing I have left? I've had all kinds of blood-tests and such and I really can't imagine what else it would be. I'm a little scared and lonely, having never been around many hearing-impaired people. I have a five month old daughter and I worry about being able to take care of her. Do you have any insight or suggestions?

20090130200418AAoTTuK	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do I loose weight around my stomach and thighs?	I refuse to count calories or diet. I wont cut out the foods I enjoy simply because a book says I'll loose weight. I know its possible to loose weight and still eat what you like. No dont get me wrong i've learned moderation. I dont eat fast food, and I only eat once a day because I'm not hungry alot of the time.     I've started to exercise daily, stretches, crunches and push-ups. and every other day I do 30 minuets of cardio. I cant do more then that until my body gets used to it. As I must admit I let myself go over the past year to the point where to much movement hurts me.    So my question is what else can I do to loose weight, what in home work outs can I do that will help me shed weight especially around my stomach and thighs which is where it built up more then anywhere.    And no, i'm not some 15 year old 120 pound girl who thinks they are fat. I'm 19, and 275 pounds and really dying to loose the weight. Oh and I dont blame anyone but myself for getting this large, i let myself go and now I intend to get myself back :)     I also dont have money to go out and buy any equipment of any kind, nor do I own any already.
