Then click on Search  Then Wala!     Oh and to Transfer go to the Sync button in Windows Media Player    I HOPE THIS HELPS    Oh and to do it in Itunes:  Go to file preferences and theres a bar for itunes click it. then click the box that says import music to itunes. on itunes you may need to highlight the imported songs and click "advanced" and convert the songs to AAC|`|0227f887dae165d6a58cad79b4ec14deaa	Yes you can.  Save the music to itunes and you can download from itunes to your ipod.  Or you can save music as mp3's to a music folder preferrably in your desktop.  Plug in your usb cable from your ipod and then drag and drop songs you choose onto your ipod.|`|dd4ee7bca1bfe893fba36d8cf6946eebaa	yeah, go to file preferences and theres a bar for itunes click it. then click the box that says import music to itunes. on itunes you  may need to highlight the imported songs and click "advanced" and convert the songs to AAC
5671adb7c90fee3c432eb1af934ef8c4aa	johnny cash.    To explain:  The star has 5 points, square has 4, and the triangle has 3. Starting with the triangle count every 3 letters and keep going to the square and then to the star. However, count every 4 for the square and 5 for the star. You will then get "artist know as blamanck". Which means "man in black". (the word "man" is in the middle of "black") The celebrity know as the man in black is Johnny Cash.    Good Luck! :)|`|2c6087e9dc9ff3fa9fb0767d42be8b4eaa	Johnny Cash|`|29105f118e41ab7505dff09264815e48aa	challenge= johnny cash|`|7bbbdfa2567102d731cbc890d9530aceaa	How did anybody get Johnny cash?

Every minute and every second is precious  I don't want to let go the hands that I'm holding tight  The plane at 10:30 is waiting  Don't let my own tears fall again  I have to go  You have to remember~~~     It's so hard to forget our story  There are too many memories and hopes  It doesn't matter how crazy it was  I'm willing to house it with a life time  Our story cannot be forgotten  There are too many actions waiting for developing  Don't give up  Because there will be one day that we'll be reunited  I know you are lonely  It's really sad being alone  Missing is a pain  How can I live without you?   There is allurement everywhere  It's very easy to make mistakes if I'm not strong enough  Can you the harvest in the future?   Will you be waiting patiently?   It's very hard to forget our story  There are too many memories and hopes  It doesn't matter how crazy it was  I'm willing to house it with a life time  Our story cannot be forgotten  There are too many actions waiting for developing  Don't give up  Because there will be one day that we'll be reunited  Let us finish the story

AA11780081	You have to be part of an entourage...or you have to jump somebody who has tickets and steal them.  Seriously, you can't buy tickets.  They give them out to a select group of people.  Then those people get mugged and have the tickets stolen at gunpoint, then the people who stole them get robbed.  Then those people get beaten up, and somebody else takes the tickets.  This goes on and on until the day of the show.  The last person to steal the tickets before the show starts gets to go.  It's like some gangsta scavenger hunt.  However, once the show starts, there are still people trying to get in, so they attack people while the show is going on (This is in fact why Dr. Dre got stabbed at the Vibe awards... he stole somebody's seat).
AA10691529	Im in southern California and its channel 10 for me but Im guessing its different but if you want to watch any episodes alot of the shows you can watch online http://abc.go.com/ then click on full episodes. they have ugly betty, desperate housewives, lost, grey's anatomy, day break, six degrees, the nine, and I think they used to have survivor but not anymore|`|c51462e20c33d1d12324c4d002074206aa	I am near Monterey, and also only have an antenna.

We have to go to a friend's house to watch ABC shows.

En ce qui concerne Daniel, STP n'attaque pas celui qui a eu des textes aussi inoubliables que celui-l    Dans son vieux pardessus rap  Il s'en allait l'hiver, l't  Dans le petit matin frileux  Mon vieux.

You want a movie, go buy it or learn to live without.     You are being a pirate by doing this!     What you want is illegal and against the law! Can you afford a quarter of a million dollars fine or 5 years in jail or both if you get caught?

Her real name may not, in fact, be Karen, as she changes her name from time to time to throw off the "Feds." Her mother refers to her as "Kiki", which was her childhood nickname.

I think about all of the things I have to get done for the day, get mad at the things I didn't do yesterday. I think about the weeks and months and years to come and what I have to do in that time. I think about the things I did a good job on, and then yell at myself for the things I feel that I have failed at....My mind is never at peace.|`|jDTAyWPSaa	I on rare occasion do think. I think about where my dream woman is and why I can't find her and she is not finding me.
MelCTDgzaa	From what I remember of the book, he became her danna. I don't think they ever actually got married, but they definitely had a relationship.  I highly recommend reading the book if you get a chance - it's so much better than the movie. The emotions are much greater, and it has the narration that is necessary in some parts.|`|EvrhpqtLaa	the book actually ends quite nicely...i won't spoil it though....it's a truly wonderful book...

Geisha weren't to marry. I think the book would help you. I've not finished it yet, so I don't quite know.|`|FHtbWmW8aa	They probably ended up together for awhile befor marrying. It's supposed to be one of those kinda movies where you make up your own ending.|`|502bcf591c9113a48bee81072334ff3eaa	Wasnt he already married???

iP5AV2Rfaa	As long as you stay away from the sappy love songs I think music is a great way to get over a broken heart....  Mix that fun music with a club, some drinks, and some great friends and you'll be fine!|`|137606862ea884c9e20c11c99fd1a160aa	It depends on the music.  Eons ago, after a break up, I listened to The Cure's Disintegration CD, which made me more depressed.  And then I switched to The Echoing Green. : )    Here's their site which streams some songs.

gOTZ1ZE9aa	Yes. There were 2. First film was released in 2006-08-10, and second film was released on 28-12-2006. A spin-off film is currently in pre-production.    Death Note (, Desu Nto?) is a series of Japanese films, adapted from the Death Note manga series, released in 2006. The films primarily center around a university student who decides to rid the world of evil with the help of a supernatural notebook that kills anyone whose name is written in it. The two films were directed by Shsuke Kaneko, produced by Nippon Television and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Japan.     More details please refer to:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note_...|`|lbWRiYb2aa	there's 2 as far as i know|`|AA11288789	There are two parts of the Death Note triology.|`|BUAgfIlTaa	There's two films so far.

ZT0PPS9Yaa	The movie begins as Hostel ended, with Paxton (Jay Hernandez) on the train. After police officers try to rouse Paxton, we see that he's in a hospital, where he is questioned by officials. Paxton tells them about the factory, including that Josh was killed and the little Paxton knows about the operating procedures. After mentioning the bloodhound tattoo, the investigators ask about the murdered man found in the Vienna train station, who had the same tattoo. Paxton is nervous about this since they saw him on the security camera. The lead officer reveals his own bloodhound tattoo and eviscerates Paxton, who wakes up screaming, as the hospital scene was all a dream.    Paxton is really with his girlfriend Stephanie (Jordan Ladd) at her grandmother's house and he's so paranoid about being found by the Elite Hunting organization that he gets angry when she tells him that she told her sister where they were going. Stephanie wants him to tell someone, including Josh's mother, what happened in Europe but Paxton is too afraid of being found. Their conversation ends with an angry Paxton leaving the bedroom. The next morning, Stephanie finds his decapitated body sitting at the kitchen table. A motorcyclist is then shown, carrying a box (presumably containing Paxton's head) to a distinguished-looking older gentleman with two bloodhounds.    Next we meet the protagonists--Whitney (Bijou Phillips), Beth (Lauren German), and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), American girls who are studying abroad in Italy. They are in a figure drawing class, when they meet a female model named Axelle (Vera Jordanova). Axelle offers to take them out for drinks but Beth declines, telling Axelle that she and Whitney have planned a trip to Prague. Later, Lorna is homesick so Beth invites her along too, over Whitney's objections. On the train to Prague, Beth and Whitney go to the bar car, where a waitress delivers a drink from Axelle, who has obviously followed them. Meanwhile, Lorna is alone in their car, listening to music on her iPod. Because she has headphones on, she doesn't hear a man opening the car door behind her. Whitney and Beth leave the bar with a man they met, hoping he'll give them drugs. When they get to his car, he claims he can't find anything in his bag and his car-mates are behaving strangely, which makes the girls nervous. They try to leave but the men don't want them to and a shouting match ensues after one of the men calls them "cunts." It is revealed that Beth loathes being called that word.    When they return to their car, Lorna is in tears because the man who entered the car stole her iPod. Whitney goes to look for a police officer but when she sees the would-be drug dealer and his friends opening car doors to find the girls, she returns and locks the door. The men try the door but finding it locked, move on. Then, there is another knock on the door and it's Axelle, who claims that a man tried to steal her purse and when she struggled with him, the iPod fell from his pocket. Axelle claims to be frightened of running into the man again, so the girls invite her to stay in their car. She accepts and tells the girl that she's going on a spa vacation. The girls decide to change their plans and go instead to the spa with Axelle.    The next day, the girls check into the same hostel as the first movie. Pulp Fiction is playing on the TV in the lobby, as it was in Hostel. The American girls hand over their passports in exchange for their room key and the desk clerk invites them to the town's harvest festival. After a male guest, Miroslav (Stanislav Ianevski), expresses interest in the festival, Whitney tells her friends that they have to go. While the girls are getting settled into their rooms, the desk clerk scans their passport photos and uploads them to a website that we see is an auction site. All around the world, different people, male and female, are shown bidding on the girls. An American named Todd (Richard Burgi) wins Beth and he calls to tell his friend Stuart (Roger Bart), who doesn't seem as excited as Todd does.    The girls take a walk around the city, where they run into the Bubble Gum Gang. Lorna offers them Smints but the gang's leader spits in her face and calls them bitches as the gang runs away. Todd and Stuart arrive in Slovakia, where they check into their hotel and are given restaurant-style electronic pagers that will "go off" when the girls are ready for them. Shortly after, Todd and Stuart receive their bloodhound tattoos. Stuart balks at getting the tattoo but an Elite Hunting representative insists that it's a nonnegotiable part of the contract and Todd successfully bullies Stuart into it.    That night, the girls attend the Harvest Festival, and it is revealed that Beth inherited a significant amount of money after her mother died. Whitney tricks Lorna into drinking alcohol by claiming it is cider, which leads to Lorna (slightly) loosening up and dancing with a man named Roman. While Whitney, Axelle, and Beth are dancing together, Todd and Stuart spy on them from across the river. Stuart eventually decides to leave Todd and get a better look at Beth. As Whitney dances with Miroslav, Beth refuses a young man's offer to dance, and he leaves saying that he "could have helped" her. The desk clerk from the hostel approaches her and asks Beth if the stranger had been bothering her. Though she insists all he did was offer to dance with her, the clerk assures her the stranger will no longer bother her. He offers her a drink, which she reluctantly takes, only to throw on Stuart, who had been observing her from behind. After apologizing profusely, Beth insists on buying Stuart a beer. While she is purchasing the drinks, Lorna runs up to her excited that Roman has asked to take her on a "boat ride". Beth can see that Lorna is obviously tipsy, and tries to get her to promise that she won't go on a boat ride with him. Lorna sarcastically remarks that|`|AA10866627	The Wikipedia page for it maybe.

Any statement you write, there are many different interpretations. You may have only meant a light-hearted banter, but the reader could assume that you were attacking him.    That's why most messageboards' members use emoticons along with their statements, so that the reader knows better about the person's intent in writing the message. I tried to convince Yahoo Answerers to do the same, but nobody seems to care.|`|wQq8lXE9aa	Welcome to my world darling!

uENNtP2Haa	on the third one, it has a more open-ended feel to it (you can control it a little more)    i also agree: i think it's kind of like the damsel-in-distress always becomes this strong independant woman. that, or sexism. it's kind of cheesy.|`|WtOLlIOiaa	In the third you could but even if you save them it doesnt matter because at the end it is still the same three ppl. pretty pointless?|`|C3Q8lfVXaa	You can only do it in the 3rd. There's none with the 2nd though.

gPMPunGeaa	Wow, that's a hard one....sounds like a pretty interesting fight, though =D|`|E6pVI649aa	Itachi would win even if he didnt use his sharingan i mean he wipped out the whole Uchiha legendary Clan in like a couple hours|`|490c3e3b634f62e3cd0f7b068ff724bcaa	Itachi wouldn't stand a chance because like you said sharingan wastes tons of chakra so Kenpachi would most likely win and he would wipe out itachi and Sasuke will be the only member of the clan!! However knowing Sasuke if he finds out Kenpachi killed his brother he would explode with rage and will end up fighting kenpachi and kenpachi would wipe out the clan now for sure lol.|`|jEkfQVwIaa	itachi, because i've never watched Bleach|`|dOLMqM9Xaa	but itachi could learn to control his chakra better. i think itachi would win hands down, personally.|`|3Wrf353Naa	i didnt read the whole question but i would say kinpachi cuz he is my all time favorite besides renji hes my sexy beast love him plus we havent really seen itachi fight and i just dont like him

AA11246777	Yes,many and usually to my children's school/district office.  Especially when my oldest daughter was being sexually harassed and bullied by another student;the punishments the school gave were ineffective and the school refused to let me contact the other parents-so...my lawyer and I contact the district and had the student removed or we would have sued.|`|Z1ORBZFuaa	nope|`|qgirf0q5aa	never but i have writen a funny story for one of my ex girlfriends who was droped and had her hart broken, by another.... I have saved it and now i am going to let u read it  I hope u find this funny as she did         Born: 19 September 1975  Where: New York City, New York USA  Height: 5' 9"    He was born Jim Torreto on the 19th of September, 1975, in New York City. Only knowing his biological Mother,for 7 years he was told by his father that she couldn't cope brining up 3 mungrels and a doughter.Mr Torreto told his son when he was older enough to under stand that his mother had many different Problems wrong with her- she had one leg longer then the other,she didn't shave when we got married the priest thought we were to homo sexuals. "I've always had less information given to me about my mum",My father said later in years to come your sister will turn out the same way. He told me more information were he tried to swop my sister for a 1968 Rt Dodge my father never told me of identity of the man he tried selling my sitster to car sales man.I was exstremly confused by his bull CARCAR story of my mum and sister, how a film editor, approached him and wanted to make a movie of his life story or just put it in a side show for kicks.  I was raised, along with Punch and Duty and sister, in the Glendale Surburia , The government-funded a blockland only for my sister when she would turn out like our mother. Here dad received a major throuning in the imaginative carnival of freeky arts, not least from his adoptive father,Boryiellis , an actor and drama queen.  The torreto's would go swimming down at the Glendale pool, and play find the freek and seek on the broken-down Gym on the Ferry dust out skirts. And they'd get involved in the project's various projects. Punch made his starring debut on stage when only 3. He wasn't supposed to be the their, he was supposed to be a Potty Training productions of 321 Mockingbird lane. But dad, was offered a role in a movie, he suffered from Direct Syndrome after the first act Dad,was told not to come back,|`|ZDOfXBd2aa	No, but lately I have been debating whether I should right one to my ex-friend.|`|d759a5d5755c3cee2925fe6f7160c2f2aa	yes, to a company that didn't want to pay up a $30 rebate (that's a lot when you're my age lol) they never did...i spent 3 months on it and they just kept avoiding it.  btw it was MGE company|`|f613f2fe5139782b7ab3cd67bba86d3caa	no   i always forget to do that everytime i get angry....  but when i do i kinda write songs....... about it|`|y5FfKGAsaa	yeah, it was for my ex-boyfriend, we were just in a fight, but i didn't actually give it to him. i ripped it after i wrote it. yup, yup.|`|9LmHG2l7aa	yes. to the yahoo staff. it was regarding my suspension. they reactivated my account :)|`|AA11072232	Hmm...to my EX Ex boyfriend...I told him i hated him and things like that but thats cuz we broke its cuz he got pissed cuz i calle him retarded...and yeah..|`|AA11402010	yes it was to this guy and trust me u dont want to kno what it said|`|tWf5y5YPaa	Yes  to my insurance company  i'm suing your ***...|`|uKZ8yA5Raa	no.

By the way did you notice that they mentioned the wicker man like once throughout the movie.....come on, if your making a movie i think the title should relate to it, especially one that says " the wicker man"|`|AA10505261	i gotta say i wish i knew what nick cage was thinkin` i`m pretty sure they were supposed to be pagans, or wicca , but then they threw in some druid stuff for good measure! jeeeeez

PZrR6Fdxaa	Lets be honest it would depend where you were washed up.  I think that in most countries it would be very hard to fake amnesia the medical staff would be able to work out that you were lying!    The new look wouldnt fool anyone, lets be honest its not what you look like, it would be your dna that they would use to find out who you were if you faked amnesia.  Your accent would be a lead for them to find your identity.    Lets be honest someone would also report you as a missing person, a friend, relative or neighbour, then you would be put on a database and it would be a matter of time before they discovered who you were.|`|AA10651909	You'd get eaten up by the sharks first.

Bnmtp90Oaa	You have to pay for Itunes because it's selling songs, just like a department store sells clothes and such, Itunes SELLS songs. As far as I know, Itunes does not provide any free songs. The record companies and artists need to be paid for their work, and that's the reason the songs must be sold.|`|SqVm7fUNaa	Itunes is a network that is legal. This means that all songs available must be purchased in order to download. I myself always use Itunes to buy my music. Limewire and other on-line music systems sell free music illegally. However, many people still use it.   Also, iTunes does offer free music. However, it may not offer the artists you mentioned. I once received an Amy Winehouse song before she became popular. The free music given away is that of up and coming new artists. However, you will be surprised to see how many of these new artists become popular!     The way to get free music is the following:    1. Go on Itunes Store homepage  2. Scroll down to the bar called "Free on iTunes"  3. Find the song, movie, or show you like and click on it  4. Find the free song on the album  5. Click "Get Song"    I hope that helps you out :]|`|H7Z8ucfAaa	You can download Limewire to get free songs

CLBKf3V0aa	Work on some percussion. You don't realize it until you start making music that the percussion is the backbone of your song. It gives it rhythm and takes away from the repetitiveness. Work on the Percussion along with the bassline before you try to work on the lead. You should also make sure that your lead doesn't over power the entire song. Try coming up with  a melody that goes on for 32 measures. Yes it might seem like a long time, but it will give you a chance to explore other parts of the song you might not have thought about. Example: Are there some soft synths underneath creating harmony or a crescendo, or is any part of this song in stereo, or should I bring this synth in really hard or should it come in soft. Stuff like that gives the song variation so it isn't repetitive. Right now as it stands it's very bland, but I would like to see what kinds of improvements you make to this song and I would like to here some songs in the future. Please don't take my comments as being too harsh. They are merely my opinions and suggestions.|`|OtJTmjdKaa	make sure it sounds original and use a good programme like q base or reason etc and don't use the quick and easy programmes where it only take one day to make a tune.Spend time on the production.
CsNsE0M7aa	you can try to download them from bearshare ( www.bearshare.com). they have a great selection of hard to find movies. just remember that this is  peer to peer network and operates on the premise that "friends' are sharing materials. that being said, it is a good idea to download the Peer Guardian to keep agencies like the R.I.A.A. from tracking your downloading activities while on one of these networks. as of this writing the Peer Guradian ( which blocks and allow you to see exactly WHo is monitoring you) is not available for Windows vista operating systems (although they  say it ill be soon). You can download Peer Guardian at www.downloads.com or www.methlabs.com for free. or do a google search for Peer Guardian.    Good Luck.|`|b7e8970917a5293f8a885d5b48ab6793aa	ovguide.com

mkKk9XkMaa	Several things might be a contributing factor, (and their weed isn't that great, trust me) but one for sure is their culture. It's much more deep rooted and extensive, going back a couple thousand years. This offered many bands like Led Zeppelin, Gentle Giant, Yes, Black Sabbath, Cream, Uriah Heep, Camel, and countless others, a vast source of lyrical and musical content. ie; Witches, castles, gnomes, the crusades, dragon slayers, Excalibur, the lady of the lake, etc.  Also many of the musicians in the UK during the late 60's early 70's were University students, many of them into the arts. I'm guessing that while they were in primary and secondary school back in the 1940's and 50's, fantasy and sci fi books by such renowned British authors as J. R. R. Tolkien, and Arthur C. Clarke were probably devoured by many of the up and coming rock stars!  Whereas in the USA, you had the Beach Boys singing about surfing!   Well I suppose American groups like the Doors, Iron Butterfly, and Vanilla Fudge tried to bridge the gap employing subject matter taken from tales of old, and LSD trips!|`|tR8t9peKaa	It is true that our dental care is pathetic over here, however that doesn't really answer the question. Personally I believe that there is no real answer, as the question is based on opinion.|`|NBbDB9Rqaa	ha, i have no clue why the UK is so good at rock, but i saw muse in concert last week, and they are amazing, not to mention British.|`|Kq7yuGT9aa	more culture|`|wwvnGMSHaa	lack of quality dental care|`|0549ae16d49680095de56a879b54689caa	i dont know why but i know exactly what your talkin about!|`|AA11810119	squirrel, squirrel, You are SO funny.... but I think it's because... they get better education than USA  I mean that's what I think anyway, They also, Have better music programs too!!!

I6Eccjnqaa	Ignorance doesn't just bother me,it annoys me to the point that I just wanna strangle those who're ignorant.|`|QMAqzpKEaa	Yes. It does. But some people like to be ignorant and prefer to live like that rather than in harmony.<br>  People say that Muslims hate Jews too and vice versa but I was brought up as a Muslim and I have Jewish friends. I really like doughnuts from Jewish bakeries and that bread with the salt in it. People no longer distinguish religion and what colour one is and which country one is from.<br>  Most people do not even know, for example, that Africa is a continent and not a country.<br>  Some do not acknowledge that India, where my parents are from, has Christians, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims ( probably Buddhists and people of other faiths too) living there. People assume that my parents are from Pakistan because my parents are Muslim. People assume that I am Hindu when I could be Christian or even Jewish as far as they know.<br>  A lot of it is because their parents or peers knew no better and because they have not had a lot of cultural and/or religious exposure. Some of these people may not have traveled to another country in their entire lifetime and, sadly, may never do so. Some of them will stick to the same set of friends for their entire life and not be open to meeting new people of different cultures and religious beliefs for their entire lifetime. Yes, ignorance bothers me but it also induces pity in my heart for the uneducated, ignorant people.|`|lGSUToFQaa	yes it is annoying|`|Tc23KWgzaa	That's not only racist it's grossly stereotypical.  On some subjects, ignorance is just not being interested in a subject which is not your forte.

The worst part is knowing that this is wrong and that no one will do anything to correct their behavior not even yourself. Its a shame.|`|a4LWildhaa	No. It's those with no common sense. Plus, they seem to practice it. Your first statement about women is sexist-not racial. Example 2 is racial, as is your last statement about it being a religion.|`|M8f4BorPaa	yeah.|`|2g8m8USQaa	It depends on the issue.  For some, it's better to remain ignorant. However, for most, it's not. I don't think a person can have a valid opinion on something they know nothing about. It only makes them look stupid and, well...ignorant.<br>  <br>  As for the person who asked the asker what race he is because he is Jewish, almost every Jewish person I know is WHITE. Jewish is a religion...NOT a race. <br>  <br>  EMT|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Ignorance is the root of all evil .|`|69b1868978e396cddf0eb64599ea6b8eaa	If Jewish is a religion, what is your race?<br>  <br>  Yes, ignorace bothers me.|`|BuJClF3Faa	Racist is any kind of prejudice, don't you know?!?!?<br>  <br>  That really annoys, me, too. I heard the BEST commercial on the radio once. It said, <br>  <br>  "I'm racist against Skiers. They make all those Moguls and stuff!"<br>  <br>  "Dude, you can't be racist again skiers. Skiers aren't a race. You can be prejudiced against them, but not racist."|`|djhCah5Maa	Yes.  My friend who is gay has stupid ideas about women.  He makes me so mad sometimes.

DqdA3njaaa	I think that is completely bogus. Danny is a wonderful singer with an amazing voice. When I heard him sing, he was one of my favorites, and I didn't even realize he was the one who's wife had died right before his audition until they mentioned it. I voted for him because of his voice.|`|7lZnHiYZaa	whaaaat? how can he have haters? i vote for him because he is an amazing singerrr, not because of his wife.

Jn7bt3JTaa	Your mother just sounds concerned. A parents Job it to raise a child into an adult. Our hope is to do whatever we can to help our children be successful, happy adults. She is probably not wanting you to "live in a fantasy world" because she is worried you won't be equipped to deal with the realities of the harsh world. Have your dreams and fantasies but, talk with your mom and tell her your real Goals. <br>  <br>  You will never stop her from worrying or being concerned. Once a parent always a parent. She sounds like she loves you very much. <br>  <br>  This isn't a case of right or wrong. Just Garden Variety teen-parent tug of war. We all do it as teens.|`|ecBx744aaa	I Agree With You =P|`|kA7GEKf7aa	Well...she might be trying to help you because unfortunately one day reality smacks you across the face. It's good to have fantasies and have an optimistic outlook on life, but you also need to realize how the world works. Not everyone can live a celebrity life and snap a finger to get whatever they want nor would you want to (believe it or not).|`|AA12034666	Having fantasies is one thing. Trying to live them is something else, entirely. The Real World is where you are, so that's where you have to live.<br>  <br>  Actually, you are both right.

I'm never where I seem to be. You might think I'm in the library studying calculus, but really I'm at SGC trying to decode Stargate addresses. You might think that I'm riding the bus to campus, but really I'm on a shuttle pod headed for starfleet academy. You might think I'm cleaning out my closet, but really I'm on an archaeological dig for long lost treasures. <br>  <br>  The human mind is very complex and creative, and without fantasy we would have no inventiveness, no progress, and no fun.|`|4saIcqO3aa	your right sometimes it is fun to go off and live in a Fantasy but sometimes you do need to live the real world (if something "important" is happening) <br>  but yes living in your dream world makes life more fun <br>  you are sooooo right|`|3YOOTokraa	You are right and wrong. You should dream but my sister is thinking ahead, about how she is going to buy a house and live with her friends during college. Not realistic from where I am from.

Not always can you find pleasure with reality|`|bNNok5Kcaa	you are both right i love fantasizing i do it everyday it just makes me happy but you have to remember to keep ur feet on the ground .

It sucks and everyone is such a wannabe.<br>  <br>  Also, Twilight. I mean the books were pretty good but they definitely were not as great as everyone's making them seem. I'm just sick of everyone wearing Twilight shirts and being sooo in love with Robert Pattinson and he's not even cute.|`|LcSwDbr4aa	The anime Death Note and how it's still very popular after all this time, I mean the concept of the show is unique and the timing is brisk and the artwork is nice and all, but why anime fans (other than me) are still going nuts over this show baffles me.|`|ZLI6K9Qmaa	Their bodies and looking like a freakin model.

I think it's plain stupid. Stephenie Meyer is just another writer. SHe isn't that good. (I read the books, so I know). I don't think her books deserve all that attention because there are many better authors who don't get enough attention because many teens these days are vampire obsessed idiots. (no offense to any of those who like Twilight. I just don't support the fans). <br>  <br>  I also agree with whoever said the Jonas Brothers. They are horrible. When they sing, it sounds horrible. I can't stand it. An on top of all that, people think they are cute. I think they are average teenage boys. I don't see anything outstanding or handsome about them.|`|wkvrBVMAaa	I completely agree with you.<br>  Tobacco=cancer, lungs full of tar, hard to get over addiction, yellow teeth, possibly death etc..<br>  <br>  And weed. Everyone seems to smoke that now.I'm like, wth. It's just making the world worse. It makes you slower, stupider, and that can jack up your educational life. Which in later life means, while they're working at McDonalds I get to have a nice home with a great job that doesn't require, "May I take your order?". I don't fall under peer pressure. I'm smart enough to say no to all that crap.|`|U0KzxpJfaa	I agree!!!<br>  And people are obsessed with being the centre of attention!!!<br>  I hate that...<br>  Like stealing other people's glory or saying stuff about people!!!<br>  If you want attention earn it, don't just make somebody else look bad or whatever!!!<br>  And fame...<br>  People will do anything for their 5 minutes!!!<br>  Like reality tv shows and stuff!!!<br>  I think it's pathetic!!!<br>  x :D|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	true.. also harry potter idk why everyones so crazy about the books movies etc. its lame|`|CXYuaLtcaa	drinking, sex, food, and money|`|EtbPhdhLaa	I agree with you there.

SCTkHr7saa	exactly my point...we didnt evolve from apes. (in my opinion)|`|MdXwD2JSaa	We didn't evolve directly from apes.<br>  We're different species, that's why.|`|klhB1ijwaa	that's why i don't believe in evalution, i believe in creation.|`|KKeLsvyGaa	That blows the evolution theory.

Some of this ancestor's offspring evolved to turned into humans, and some adapted and evolved into the diferent types of primates. It's he same way not all wolves evolved into chihuahuas. We're different branches on the same tree.|`|0VbAMZccaa	some of them wanted to stay|`|fc2wmTCVaa	because.... in some regions the apes evolved, in some regions they didnt and stayed as apes. look it up on wikipedia|`|i3S10DUqaa	Because we are not the same species as the present-day apes, therefore we evolved differently.|`|uiO590WJaa	i don't believe in the theory of evolution (proven fact:  there has never been a fossil discovered in the stages between evolved and unevolved species)|`|kEQX5sswaa	Hahaha! Good question!|`|AA11111862	I have always said this. That is one reason why evolution is crap. <br>  BTW, have a star :-).|`|70OHpjySaa	I think some were stubborn and just did not want to get down from the tree...lol!

6e2a64594546464b3adab4a7a8844e1eaa	Non ho mai visto il film Caterina va in Citt, ma un giorno guardando su skycinema ho visto la scena finale, dove lei, la ragazzina, diceva: "Le mosche hanno occhi per guardare dappertutto, i pesci, occhi per guardare a lato, ma gli uomini...gli uomini hanno occhi coi quali possono solo guardare avanti!".. Mi  piaciuta, mi  piaciuta molto... Semplice gioco di parole. Carina!    In "Giovanna d'Arco" con Milla Jovovich, quando lei viene arrestata e il "diavolo" la fa sentire in colpa dicendole:"No, l'hai fatto solo per te stessa" e lei si ricorda la scena in cui per incoraggiare la cavalleria grida: "Chi mia ama, mi segua!"...  Ho trovato forte la provocazione morale dell'uomo in nero. E' un insieme di cose, che mi spingono a dirlo. Le credenze sono difficili da abbattere, devono comunque essere rispettate... Mi ha segnato molto, molto davvero! L'altruismo nasoconde una spruzzatina di egoismo premeditato in tutti  per questo che sono cos difficile di gusti, credo all'amore.  Credo nel benessere spirituale che addolcisce ogni male terreno. Credo che il modo di vedere le cose cambi le cose stesse: se cambi il significato un bacio, da affetto, si pu trasformare in ipocrisia. Credo nella verit. Ci credo con tutto il cuore.   Credo che dal momento in cui ami, quell'egoismo di base nell'altruismo sparisca. Svanisca totalmente. Credo, comunque, che la passione non corrisponda a stupidit. Credo che tra essere stupidi ed innamorati ci sia una bella differenza e la maggior parte delle persone  stupida ;-) Senza offesa a nessuno, anch'io lo sono stata.  Credo in tante cose, ma la pi importante  credere sempre in qualcosa, che sia Babbo Natale, la spiritualit, la religiosit, l'immortalit dell'anima oppure il senso infinito della vita. Credo che non esista persona senza credo, che tutti debbano essere rispettati, tutti, TUTTI, anche gli assasini, ma pochi stimati, pochi odiati, perch l'odio  sacro quanto l'amore, l'odio uccide prima te e poi gli altri.. Lo coltivi notte dopo notte e ti squarcia l'anima, mentre l'amore te la scombussola dolcemente..  Credo che Giovanna d'Arco sia stata una grande ragazza. E' un p il mio idolo, anche se sono il suo esatto contrario. Io parlo di stile di vita e non di credenze. Lei  stata tenace.  Ah, e soprattutto credo che un persona sola, se vuole, pu cambiare il mondo...  La colpa non  mai a senso unico.  La vita non  un film,  ancor pi maginfica e potente in perdite e rivincite...  Penso che l'arte sia una vincita contro questa "standardizzazione" di tutto e tutti. Puoi amare cose insensate senza sentirti dar del matto... ;-)    Penso anche di essere egocentrica e logorroica, ma forse di questo voi ne siete gi certi.. ;-) Scusate il dilungamento, ma mi scivolano le dita sulla tastiera..

Big mistake!|`|F3oItTOfaa	Ok Look, I Am A Huge Fan Of Haystak. And I Really Dont Care For Eminem So Much, But Being A White Rapper Myself, I Think That Haystak Crushed Eminem, I Mean The Part In The Song Called "I'm That Whiteboy" Where Stak Said "Ultimately, Get Halies Daddy, Snatched Up Out The Back Of A Station Wagon" Made Eminem Cry, Now Dont Get Me Wrong, Eminem Is As Big As A Part Of Hip-Hop Today As He Was Whenever "My Name Is" Came Out, But Haystak Has Been In The Game For A Lot Longer Than Em Has. Stak Sounds Better, Gets More Emotional, And Stays Rugged Through Everyone Of His Songs. Eminem Only Picks On People Smaller Than Himself Like, Christina, Brittney, Moby, Fred Durst, NSYNC, And Countless Others. While Haystak Has Been Goin At Dr. Dres Throat Ever Since Day One. So In My Opinion, I Think The Battle Was Started And Won By Mr. Haystak Mak Million Long Before Eminem Even knew About It.|`|VtHZjeVkaa	Eminem doesn't have time to respond to retards like him. Haystack just wants attention. That fat *** whiteboy doesn't know what hes talking about. hes not even good.

f70NVBaYaa	sittin at the bar.. by rehab..  good song|`|1IYoKTGSaa	Dont know but thanks to be online.|`|NaWLLDLaaa	Rehab-Sitting At A Bar|`|EtAEFsTGaa	All you had to do is google some of the lyrics and take a little more time to check the different sites to find out who sings it and what the name is. But yeah, what the other "question answer people" said.
AA11738321	One on hand I would say that what can make music good or bad to any specific person is how we interpret the song and/or can relate to it.    On the other I would say is the fact you ask this question further proof that image is more important in determining a group's success, rather than based on meaningful songs/lyrics?    The music industry has diluted itself so with many people exhibiting marginal talent and the marketing bigwigs behind them that it sometimes seems that the most popular singer/group could make an inane song about dipping houseflies in paint and it could rocket to  1 on the charts, based on sheer popularity and album sales.|`|tTrOtQ1Naa	it does not have to hae any reason or ryhme it just takes u away|`|uGydb5zAaa	the lyrics have meaning u just dont see it like the patd song camisado its about ryan ross' father who was an alcoholic|`|AA11971550	I understand the not hating part, same here. I don't understand what you mean though. I think that p!atd and fob's lyrics are fairly meaningful and not that hard to discern. then again, I've always been a little bit of a lit junkie. what songs do you think don't make any sense? (plus I think the lyrics make them who they are)

If you're reading this I'm already home.    If you're reading this  Half way around the world  I won't be there to see the birth of our little girl  I hope she looks like you  I hope she fights like me  Stand up for the innocent and the weak  I'm laying down my gun  Hanging up my boots  Tell dad I don't regret that id follow in his shoes    So lay me down  In that open field out on the edge of town  And know my soul is where my momma always prayed where it would go  If you're reading this, I'm already home    If you're reading this, there is going to come a day  You move on and find someone else and that?s okay  Just remember this  I'm in a better place  Soldiers live in peace and angels sing amazing grace    So lay me down  In that open field out on the edge of town  And know my soul is where my momma prayed where that it would go  If you're reading this  If you're reading this  I'm already home|`|2aff3219746d8bc27a2c484a334f93ffaa	its definitely Tim mcgraw   its an amazing song... very emotional though|`|q4NurbxQaa	its by - tim mcgraw   its called -  if you're reading this|`|uLYmJuzSaa	My Chemical Romance -- Were still so young and desperate for attention...|`|EY0TFGIIaa	sorry i dont.  probably a country song.|`|AA10559451	Are you kidding?

dWHeWkb7aa	the diaphram is the muscle that you flexes in order to allow you to inhale and exhale. In theatre and music the diaphram is used to project ones voice. To scream with your diaphram will allow you to get a high pitch without hurting your throat too much. However even singing damages your vocals over time and many singer have to get their a "voice scrub" a procedure wherein you vocal chords are scrapped. Simply try talking really loud and you are using your diaphram, If you take a deep breath and blow out your air and flex your stomach then you are using the same technique as singing with your diaphram|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	If you want to be  a musician, try finding some talent.

It depends on the base material you use for the pick, but 200 Delrin picks printed one color on 1 side for only about $60 total.  Printing one color on 2 sides is about $85.<br>  <br>  You can upload your own artwork or use their canned images.  If you just want text only, that gets a lot cheaper.<br>  <br>  If you just want to buy unprinted picks, it looks like he sells 100 white Delrin picks for $39.<br>  <br>  www.steveclayton.com<br>  <br>  The only thing I would steer you away from is the pearl base picks.  They look great and give a nice high contrast to your printing.  But, at least for me, the printing rubbed off pretty easy.  Plus, the way I play, I was actually grinding a sharp edge on the pick which made for a great string slicer after a few hours!<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Musiciansfriend.com , music123.com in the accessories catagory.|`|jaBOPXGTaa	You can check this site.

I live in Port Angeles, Washington--setting for some of the action in the book. I now have to wait TWO HOURS for a table at Bella Italia, which is my favorite restaurant. WHY?????

lJcbQ00Haa	"Flightless Bird, American Mouth," Iron & Wine<br>  <br>  It's a good song, mellow, hopeful, plus I heard it's in Twilight now or something?

Tin3tvtuaa	I think the problem people have with high school musical is that it is too cheesy. I myself don't care for it. I think another reason alot of people don't like it is because Disney over-does it.

When I was at home I found a lot of comfort from my parents. Hang out with them. Do things with them. If you have that family, spend time with them, because that is such a good thing for you.

Un type entre dans un bistrot et s'assoit  une table. Il n'y a personne d'autre, et le gar?on, derrire le bar, lui demande :  "Monsieur, vous prenez quelque chose ?  - Ah, ben... Un p'tit ricard."  Le serveur lui apporte son verre. L'autre le boit, lentement, puis il se lve et commence  sortir.  Le serveur: "HO! Monsieur, votre verre...  - Ben quoi mon verre...?  - Il faudrait peut-tre voir  payer...  - Comment ?a, payer! Moi, je suis assis la bien tranquillement, je ne demande rien, vous me proposez un verre, je croyais que c'tait de bon coeur... Maintenant vous me dites qu'il faut payer...  Le serveur le regarde bien, pour se mettre son visage en tte, et lui dit d'accord (mais toi je t'ai repr).  Le lendemain, en plein coup de feu, le serveur ne sait plus ou donner de la tte. Le type vient s'installer au bout du comptoir, et le gar?on, en voyant du coin de l'oeil quelqu'un s'asseoir lui demande :  - Monsieur, vous prenez quelque chose ?  - Ah, ben merci, oui, un p'tit Ricard   Le serveur se fige en le reconnaissant. Les dents serres, il lui donne son verre et le regarde partir.  Le lendemain, personne dans le troquet. Le type arrive, s'installe a une table. Le serveur l'ignore, et continue  nettoyer ses verres. Au bout d'un moment, le type se lve, se met au bar et sort un paquet crasseux de sa poche. Il en sort des dbris de pain moisis pleins de vers, et commence  les dcouper avec un petit couteau. Le gar?on voit ?a, et s'approche:  - Qu'est-ce que vous faites sur mon comptoir... ?  - Ben, je dcoupe ces bouts de pain...  - Mais!? Pourquoi faire ?  - Ah, c'est pour la pche.  - Pour la pche?!

f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I've found respect for one of my contacts who has deep religious beliefs. I had to put aside my pride and accept their views.

I am amazed by the answers some of the people give and the questions they ask.  I am from a small town where everyone is basically the same.  Reading all of the randomness on here is like a breathe of fresh air.  Perverted, rude, and sometimes down right asshole-ish air, but so different from what I am used to.   |`|RroLnHUTaa	No attitudes on yahoo answers is really different from what there is in real life. Except that there exists no place off-line in the community where people can just hang out and ask random questions.    I wish there was tho. off-line town is dull|`|ttg7v0Euaa	meh      |`|h2SpBoEraa	Not really..  but I've learned that people can be so close minded at times..  |`|5yuqCzUmaa	Sometimes it has made me think, generally about religion.

01a59fe6673fac3d7797c061b759cc2faa	Hola espero te guste es la primera poesia que aprendi de peke me fascino y me sigue gustando igual hasta hoy  Saludos...    El Seminarista de los ojos ******    Desde la ventana de un casucho viejo   abierta en verano, cerrada en invierno   por vidrios verdosos y plomos espesos,   una salmantina de rubio cabello   y ojos que parecen pedazos de cielo,   mientas la costura mezcla con el rezo,   ve todas las tardes pasar en silencio   los seminaristas que van de paseo.     Baja la cabeza, sin erguir el cuerpo,   marchan en dos filas pausados y austeros,   sin ms nota alegre sobre el traje *****   que la beca roja que ci?e su cuello,   y que por la espalda casi roza el suelo.     Un seminarista, entre todos ellos,   marcha siempre erguido, con aire resuelto.   La negra sotana dibuja su cuerpo   gallardo y airoso, flexible y esbelto.   l, solo a hurtadillas y con el recelo   de que sus miradas observen los clrigos,   desde que en la calle vislumbra a lo lejos   a la salmantina de rubio cabello   la mira muy fijo, con mirar intenso.   Y siempre que pasa le deja el recuerdo   de aquella mirada de sus ojos ******.   Montono y tardo va pasando el tiempo   y muere el esto y el oto?o luego,   y vienen las tardes plomizas de invierno.     Desde la ventana del casucho viejo   siempre sola y triste; rezando y cosiendo   una salmantina de rubio cabello   ve todas las tardes pasar en silencio   los seminaristas que van de paseo.     Pero no ve a todos: ve solo a uno de ellos,   su seminarista de los ojos ******;   cada vez que pasa gallardo y esbelto,   observa la ni?a que pide aquel cuerpo   marciales arreos.     Cuando en ella fija sus ojos abiertos   con vivas y audaces miradas de fuego,   parece decirla:  ?Te quiero!, ?te quiero!,   ?Yo no he de ser cura, yo no puedo serlo!   ?Si yo no soy tuyo, me muero, me muero!   A la ni?a entonces se le oprime el pecho,   la labor suspende y olvida los rezos,   y ya vive slo en su pensamiento   el seminarista de los ojos ******.     En una lluviosa ma?ana de inverno   la ni?a que alegre saltaba del lecho,   oy tristes cnticos y fnebres rezos;   por la angosta calle pasaba un entierro.     Un seminarista sin duda era el muerto;   pues, cuatro, llevaban en hombros el fretro,   con la beca roja por cima cubierto,   y sobre la beca, el bonete *****.   Con sus voces roncas cantaban los clrigos   los seminaristas iban en silencio   siempre en dos filas hacia el cementerio   como por las tardes al ir de paseo.     La ni?a angustiada miraba el cortejo   los conoce a todos a fuerza de verlos...   tan slo, tan slo faltaba entre ellos...   el seminarista de los ojos ******.     Corriendo los a?os, pas mucho tiempo...   y all en la ventana del casucho viejo,   una pobre anciana de blancos cabellos,   con la tez rugosa y encorvado el cuerpo,   mientras la costura mezcla con el rezo,   ve todas las tardes pasar en silencio   los seminaristas que van de paseo.     La labor suspende, los mira, y al verlos   sus ojos azules ya tristes y muertos   vierten silenciosas lgrimas de hielo.     Sola, vieja y triste, an guarda el recuerdo   del seminarista de los ojos ******...

Todo eran mentiras, todo era miedo, todo eran dudas  Y nunca supe si t me queras, o si solo te reas de m.

Y ahora vive sola, sin haber conocido amor alguno,  Sin haber experimentado esa felicidad  Que con una mirada, una sonrisa o un saludo tuyo,  Haca que todo valiera la pena".    2.:  "No encuentro razones por las que seguir amndote,  Quizs ma?ana no me vuelvas a ver, quizs ma?ana no exista mas.  Te ense?e todo lo que tenia para ofrecerte, y tu te marchaste con otra.  Sent como mil cuchillos atravesaban mi lnguido corazn,  Y sent como iba muriendo con cada beso, con cada abrazo que t le dabas.  Todas las noches me quedo mirando tu foto,  Pensando en todo lo que podra haber pasado, y que no pas,  Todas las noches, lloro, no puedo dejar de pensar en ti,  Ya no puedo conciliar el sue?o, porque al cerrar los ojos, te veo besndola.  Ya no se qu hacer, ?Me atrever a cortar la delgada lnea de mi vida?"    3.:  Al verte aparecer aquel da, mi cuerpo empez a temblar,  Una sensacin extra?a se apoderaba de m, no me dejaba reaccionar.

Years ago, they used to believe that A person's IQ was fixed at the age of 18. Then they thought it was 21. Now they know that a person's brain doesn't stop developing until the age of 25 and that your IQ never stops developing thereafter. i.e. It's never too late!    The only way you can increase your IQ is by reading and comprehending. When you read, you must think about what you read and understand it. The only way you can increase your IQ is by reading 'boring books'. Yes, those boring text books that you have been running away from your whole life :). You must force yourself to read it even if it's a little bit per day. If you want to be smart, now you know how.    Next time you look at a 'smart' person, bear in mind that they aren't super humans. If they are something like a Genius, they have been exposed to challenging intellectual content at an early age. Remember that there are occasions where they have been born with abnormally large cranial capacities, but that still doesn't mean they have been born geniuses. |`|9XgLMGofaa	only at the ones who are so smart they don't have to study. |`|57af3cd106168b01009e4dbbc6d55acbaa	No|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	Not that i can ever remember mate .... jealousy is such a useless emotion ....... besides, ima happy to be me.    peace baby  ?|`|DooqYRfAaa	Jealous that some people who don't even study manage to get perfect grades, yes.

Although I understand why Rachel would be upset, I'm still on his side|`|gaveh3Rfaa	they could havve been who knows|`|GuRluYmraa	i think rachel said that she needed a break and ross thought she needed some space to think for a while but she meant to actually break up for a while.

633093b3dc7209a336fa9ef82d5f1d4faa	Well since your only 12, your voice hasn't changed yet.  That should happen in the next couple of years. Once that happens, your voice will deepen and you'll sound more manly.   If you want to sing from your diaphragm, try singing while lying on your back.  It's supposed to help.  As far as the way your voice sounds, you will have to practice jazzing it up.  Try copying some of your favorite singers inflections, runs, notes and see if any of them work for you.  If you can afford it, take some singing lessons, or join the church or school choir for more experience and free training.  :)|`|OoKDLzO4aa	i'm 13 too.  I've been singing (in musicals and talent shows and whatnot since i could talk) and i too feel sometimes as if i sound like every other singer out there (gah exspecially if your a girl every one says you sound exactly like Hayley from Paramore which i don't have a probem with...but i'd like to be unique) so i'd say it will probably take a while for our own uniqueness to come in and find it self so  don't give up...  now you speak of the diaphram or singing the right way i seriously belive that there really is a specific bad way to sing (well actually there is alot of nasly throat stuff and that is bad) but just sing from your lungs and not your head. I was somewhat classically trained for a while and my teacher had me sound stuff before i sang for example:  Twinkle Twinkle Little Star i would do the notes,  ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  anyway try different warmup techniques see if you sound different after your voice has been properly warmed up that sometimes changes alot.   |`|iGnKUA18aa	Maybe get lessons? Your voice also may be changing since you're just twelve. Try breathing exorcises and mess around with voice to get different pitches and comfort levels. Listen to R&B to help you get some passion and make it more interesting sounding. I don't know, i'm not a good singer, maybe you just don't have the skill, but you can certainly work on it.|`|AnT4nHZwaa	im 12 too|`|Bx9mV59Iaa	Music tool-   http://mymusictool.info/|`|mDWiTJAOaa	Your still growing. Males voice usually changes when they are in there mid-teens 13-15 so give it time and practice.

AA11065140	It sounds as if there were a couple of things that led to it...    After the announcement that Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley planned to divorce, Macdonald joked about their irreconcilable differences on Weekend Update: "She's more of a stay-at-home type, and he's more of a homosexual pedophile." He followed this up a few episodes later with a report about the singer's recent collapse and hospitalization. Referring to a report of how Jackson had decorated his hospital room with giant photographs of Shirley Temple, Macdonald remarked that viewers should not get the wrong idea, adding, "We'd like to remind you that Michael Jackson is, in fact, a homosexual pedophile." The joke elicited audible gasps from some audience members. He responded to this by saying, "What? He is a homosexual pedophile."     Macdonald's time with Saturday Night Live effectively ended in late 1997 when he was finally fired from the Weekend Update segment upon the insistence of NBC West Coast Executive Don Ohlmeyer, who pressured the producers to remove him, explaining that Macdonald was "not funny." Some believe that Don Ohlmeyer's friendship with O.J. Simpson  a celebrity whom Macdonald often antagonized on the show  may have fueled Ohlmeyer's decision.[1] Ohlmeyer denied the rumor, arguing that other NBC late-night comedians (e.g., Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, and other SNL players) also constantly lampooned Simpson with little to no sanction, and that his decision was based solely on audience reaction through tapes he had personally reviewed. David Letterman and Howard Stern later insisted in interviews with Macdonald that Ohlmeyer was really just carrying out the work of producer Lorne Michaels, who was too cowardly to fire him directly.    On February 28, 1998, one of his last appearances on SNL occurred as host of a fictitious TV show called Who's More Grizzled?, who asked questions of "mountain men" played by that night's host Garth Brooks and special guest Robert Duvall. In the sketch, Brooks' character said to Macdonald's character, "I don't much care for you," to which Macdonald replied, "A lot of people don't."|`|zUZRPmYAaa	yes he was|`|J30kfJpQaa	It was because he wasn't funny.

HCqJixZmaa	Looking in the mirror. SCARY STUFF!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHH|`|pfaddytkaa	WHEN I DIDN'T GET A TOY IN MY CEREAL BOX!!!|`|A5sjOsrDaa	i was at my brothers hockey game(he's an amazing hockey player) with my family and he was chasing a puck into the corner when the goalie stuck his stick out and tripped my brother. he ended up crashing into the corner boards at an awkward angle and sort of head first. he hit so hard it knocked him out and when he woke up he wasnt able to move. the whole place got quite. he was just laying on the ice with a bunch of paramedics and doctors around him. both teams were kneeling on the ice (like football players do when someone gets hurt). that was scarey. i thought i was gonna throw up. but when one of the doctors and the coach called for my dad to come out on the ice i thought for sure my brother was paralyzed. i was crying, my mom was crying. thankfully after about 10 minutes my brother tried to sit up and he refused to be taken out of there on a stretcher.  with a little help he skated off the ice.|`|fFAbrixlaa	i was @ my friends sleepover and b4 we wen 2 sleep b4 it waz dark out we wen 2 the forest and 1 of the gurls @ the sleepovas dads came out and said that there waz homles men in the forest.

2ru2Kv7waa	existen 2 tipos de creacin :    ciencia!  religin!    tubo un fastidioso examen sobre eso! >:(    x la ciencia fue desde el mono hasta el homo sapiens sapiens (hombre actual)     y x la religio x obra y gracia de dios!    bye Saludos!|`|7e6cfa6d50bb6926590bcaf5fde25ed5aa	como ya te dijeron esto es el constante Ciencia Vs. Religion y existen otras religiones (budismo por ejemplo) que hablan de primeros hombres pero no los llaman adan y eva, como veras estarias abarcando con tu pregunta solo una parte de la incognita, en realidad todos los seres humanos necesitamos tener fe en algo o en alguien por eso surgen las religiones, (espero no ofender); o mira por que crees que hubo un periodo en que la iglesia perseguia a personas, porque a todo aquel que estudiaba comenzaba a ver la vida de otra forma y no solo religiosamente y los  llamaban herejes, brujos, etc. Si te surge esta duda es porque ya tienes cierto grado academico y ves mas alla de lo que tu religion te puede marcar, es tambien por lo que hay tanta gente sin religion o ateos, eso no quiere decir que no tengan fe porque es un alimento para cualquier ser humano pero su sentido cambia. Entonces te contestaria que ambas versiones son ciertas segun el enfoque que estes defendiendo, los religiosos te diran esto y no puedes contradecirlos porque es "su verdad" y no puedes revocarlos porque estarias en contra de sus principios, de su fe; y ya se ha demostrado que evolucionamos de los simios y esto lo defenderan a capa y espada todo aquel que haya estudiado.    Buena pregunta  Bye|`|p2gaXgsWaa	Adan & Eva nunka exiiztiierOn!!|`|CPh1VWiIaa	pues segun la biblia dice que descendemos de avan y eva y segun la ciencia dice que descendemos de los monos hay varias ipotesis que dan a entender eso que todo venimos de una evolucion, claro que la biblia no dice eso. ahora yo me pregunto si no hubo evolucion segun la biblia como explican los fociles de los dinosaurios? una vez le pregunte eso a un pastor y me dijo ES UN BONITO TEMA DE ESTUDIO PERO NO HAY NADA DE CIERTO Y YO LE RESPONDO Y ENTONCES QUE SON LOS FOCILES DE LOS DINOSAURIOS ACASO ALGUN UNIVERSITARIO LO CREO Y LO DEJO ENTERRADO?

RTOmb6vxaa	After a bit of waffling, I think "Good Riddance".  I know it's a little overdone, but to me, the Michelle Branch song is more about a personal relationship, whereas Green Days seems like a better fit for graduation.   That's my opinion anyway.  Break a leg!|`|bcjJuiYQaa	Good Riddance, it's just such a better farewell song and more people like it than Michelle Branch, Goodbye To You doesn't really make much sense for graduation because it's obviously about a person.|`|xdC7cxLmaa	good riddance defiantly. it has a much nicer sound and can be really personal.|`|a7T9UyrRaa	goodbye to you     PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION!!!!|`|RGMVnp8Xaa	good riddance, better song choice and more time on the guitar than  singing|`|Siv7a1DCaa	Good Riddance is beautiful, sing that one, but be sure to add your special bam! to it lol since it's a boy singing it.|`|0DxNWTvjaa	Do you realize that whne Green day sings "I hope you have the time of your life" Theyre being sarcastic.They dont actually mean it.  Goodbye to you is a great song! Choose that one.|`|ZlbWKAHtaa	They're both very good. I think I would pick the first song though. It seems to fit the moment more.

En las cmaras digitales, el sensor o CCD es el chip encargado de la captura de la imagen. Est compuesto por una malla de miles de celdas fotosensibles en las que se recibe la imagen formada por el lente.     Cada una de esas celdas genera una corriente elctrica en presencia de la luz. Esa corriente elctrica ser luego convertida en datos numricos que se almacenarn en forma digital binaria en la memoria de la cmara dando origen a un pxel.     Cada una de esas celdas genera una cantidad ms o menos fija de corriente elctrica (y por lo tanto de datos) al azar, an en ausencia de la luz y en relacin a la temperatura.     La sensibilidad de cada uno de los elementos del sensor es fija, con un valor aproximado equivalente a 100 ISO. Los ndices ISO superiores que nos ofrece la cmara digital se logran no por un incremento en la sensibilidad de los elementos captores, sino por una amplificacin posterior de la se?al que estos emiten.     Como estos elementos tienen una emisin de se?al de base mas o menos fija, al capturar una se?al lumnica dbil y amplificarla, estamos amplificando tambin una buena porcin de la emisin de datos aleatoria del chip, con lo que se mezclar una cantidad de se?al aleatoria sin contenido a la se?al correspondiente a la imagen.|`|b3DUo90jaa	Pues con el grado de sensibilidad tiene que ver, eso s en el tema digital no estoy muy puesto, pero si se leer las isobaras, las curvas isotrmicas y una serie de isos relacionados con el tiempo y otras cuestiones, pero como me hables de pixels y esas cosas me pierdo.|`|59d873759755e56907f7505fa6d870a2aa	El ISO es el grado de sensibilidad de la peliula (el rollo para cuestiones practicas). Si tu camara es de las nuevas, la mayoria automaticamente configuran el ISO (te has fijado que el rollo tiene una especie de codigo de barras? pues con eso tu camara lo reconoce y lo ajusta). Si es viejita tu camara pues buscale bien (aunque nunca esta escondido, esta muy a la vista) porque si no te saldran mal tus fotos.

8Kwwgtvlaa	September 14, 1973  99 "Adios, Johnny Bravo "A slick-talking talent scout named Tami Rogers wants sign Greg to a solo recording contract, and totally make him over into a singer named Johnny Bravo. He winds up alienating his siblings (who believe Greg had plans to abandon them) and upsetting his parents when he announces plans to postpone college. Greg's looking forward to solo stardom, but when he discovers his recordings have been electronically "sweetened," he minces no words in expressing his dislike for the end product. Tami and her hipster associate openly admit they liked Greg only because he "fit the suit," prompting Greg to walk out. Two unnamed songs are featured. The first is used as an audition for the fictional show "Hal Barton's TV Talent Review." Prominent lyrics include "you've got to be in love to love a love song." A second song is performed on the show likely titled "Good Time Music."

eRg04AoEaa	Though you CAN drink too much water, even get water poisoning, I'm sure YOU will be just fine, My advice is go to the bathroom, throw up if you have too, your body is adjusting if its not used to so much water. You sound like you didn't eat either, eat something that will help. & don't drink THAT much water again, but do keep drinking water, more then you normally do!|`|OezPz0ymaa	You are going to die within the hour.|`|4E2FYEHsaa	It won't kill you, just go to the toilet!

Probably not.|`|XX0RUwQYaa	If you can try eat some crackers to soak up all the water that you drank! You should be fine just rest and try not to drink more water will make it worse!

a4f44d588dc3a3f295601ae27fb43c27aa	xD Ah, most likely because that's not the title of the song...or the anime...lol.    It's called "Flying in the Sky," and it's from Mobile Fighter G Gundam. It's my second favorite Gundam series, the first being Gundam Wing. It's sung by Hitofumi Ushima.    Here's the actual video for the 1st Opening.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHgjNdPAU...    He also made an English version.     Here's a link for the official OST.  http://gh.ffshrine.org/soundtracks/6903    Just download the first song, labeled "Flying in the Sky."  You should see "click here" to download in bold letters.    Enjoy! ^__^
AA12193030	The song is "While I'm Waiting" by John Waller. Here are the lyrics:    I'm waiting   I'm waiting on You, Lord   And I am hopeful   I'm waiting on You, Lord   Though it is painful   But patiently, I will wait     I will move ahead, bold and confident   Taking every step in obedience   While I'm waiting   I will serve You   While I'm waiting   I will worship   While I'm waiting   I will not faint   I'll be running the race   Even while I wait     I'm waiting   I'm waiting on You, Lord   And I am peaceful   I'm waiting on You, Lord   Though it's not easy   But faithfully, I will wait   Yes, I will wait   I will serve You while I'm waiting   I will worship while I'm waiting   I will serve You while I'm waiting   I will worship while I'm waiting   I will serve you while I'm waiting   I will worship while I'm waiting on You, Lord    P.S. I have seen the movie, but once is not enough. I'll try to catch it again while it's still in theaters, and then watch it every year after it comes out on DVD. It is an awesome movie.

AA10177224	Panic At The Disco -  Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off      Is it still me that makes you sweat?  Am I who you think about in bed?  When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking as you're sliding off your dress?   Then think of what you did  And how I hope to God he was worth it.  When the lights are dim and your heart is racing as your fingers touch his skin.  I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better ****   Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie you had me  Girl I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of   Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?  No, no, no, you know it will always just be me    Let's get these teen hearts beating. Faster, faster  So testosterone boys and harlequin girls,  Will you dance to this beat, and hold a lover close?  So testosterone boys and harlequin girls,  Will you dance to this beat, and hold a lover close?

(Let's pick up, pick up)    Oh now I do recall, we were just getting to the part  Where the shock sets in, and the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick.  I hope you didn't expect that you'd get all of the attention.  Now let's not get selfish  Did you really think Id let you kill this chorus?    Let's get these teen hearts beating. Faster, faster  So testosterone boys and harlequin girls,  Will you dance to this beat, and hold a lover close?  So testosterone boys and harlequin girls,  Will you dance to this beat, and hold a lover close?    Dance to this beat  Dance to this beat  Dance to this beat    Let's get these teen hearts beating.

uLEpOpSMaa	I'd watch Moonraker 50 times in a row before watching Casino Royal once.  Yes, Moonraker has "some" cheesy fight scenes but still contains Roger Moore's like-able witty humor, a cool boat chase, good scenery, an interesting villain, and an overall decent storyline.    Daniel Craig is not a suitable Bond actor at all.  Not only did they make bond less handsome and charming, but they also made every other conceivable aspect of it suck.  I haven't seen Quantum Of Solace yet but my expectations are as low as bacteria at the bottom of a garbage can.      I am glad to hear that some other people don't like the changes either.|`|6I5wLGVuaa	I think the reason its a bad film is because it lost the intellect of casino royale and because casino royale was clever and not bang bang boom boom the makers lost alot of viewers who liked the action and has tried to gain them back with this film.  Worst Bond Film ever has to be moonraker c'mon the cheesey fight scenes with Jaws just make it sooooo bad.  Ok You want more huh  Heres a list of the top 8 bad bond films ...  8. Octopussy  7. The Man With The Golden Gun  6. The World Is Not Enough  5. Tommorow Never Dies   4. Diamonds Are Forever  3. Die Another Day  2. A View To Kill  1. Moonraker  The Thing that makes them 6-3  bad are the over use of explosives and 2-1 is the cheesey fights and the scrambles on pipes and stuff like that  Hope That Helps|`|h1vlD1Zvaa	Casino Royale was really bad, so was Die Another Day. However I have yet to see Quantum of Solace, so it could be worse.|`|xN9d7YVEaa	the only thing i don't like about this movie is the guy playing james bond. he looks small and wimpy...   but i haven't watched all james bond movies so i dont know which is the worst.|`|Ll1N8tyhaa	Not really, I was disappointed with it but that doesn't make it the worst Bond movie ever.    Personally, I hated Moonraker and most critics do I think.  Here's a link for the best and worst of Bond,    http://www.webomatica.com/wordpress/2007...|`|hg5I1O2xaa	I haven't watched Quantum of Solace yet. But to me, the Bond films are getting worse and worse. I think maybe it's just getting too old and they keep switching the actors too much. They might be running out of story lines that haven't been used in other movies already.    I don't really want to see this one. I don't like Daniel Craig. He's so wimpy looking and definitely NOT good looking at all. He looks too old to be a Bond. And plus, I think he lacks the genuine look and feel to be a James Bond.|`|aa54ddaf3f5b59a9d53f475c528f55b4aa	too much cgi and poor wire work but better the "Tommorow never dies" where the whole plot fails compleltly.     |`|5YTkGB5yaa	I was disappointed with it too. |`|dpSTgytfaa	geez some people are listing some of the best ever.    as for worst, no Quantum as a sequel was not bad.    if it had been individual i would say yes.    worst is Tommorrow Never diees.    it was really pittiful.  |`|6jZcr33paa	Haha I've never seen any James Bond movies but the q is funny cuz I was at my uncles today and he kept talking about how awesome Quantum of Solace was. |`|2w6BARd3aa	i didnt like it...but it was ok...not good but still not bad    i cant remember the name of the movie but the one where Bond is in space with Jaws...that movie was horrible...OH i remember now its Moonraker :p    and just letting you know IMO the best bond film is casino royal, i LOVED that movie|`|un0C52G8aa	I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the worst James Bond movie but it's not one of the best either.

But as they get to know each other better, Risa's feelings for Otani begin to blossom.

Risa, after being caught during one of the school assembles, is punished by attending summer classes. Risa learns that she attends summer class with Ootani. After a cute, tall guy transfers into their summer class, the two of them decide to help each other out in regards to a possible love interest.

In order to be with him, she aspires to become an idol herself. With the help of SHIPS - the gentle Seiji and the bad-mouth Hiroto Kazama  and her cat mascot Naa-san, Kirari pursues the entertainment world, where she discovers that being an idol is not all fun and games, and that in order to persevere in both her love and her career, she must overcome any challenges that fortune has in store.     La corda D'oro- Hino goes to a school that specialises in music and has two streams: the normal stream and the music stream, where the music students are regarded as the more elite. She was running late for her class one day when she saw a tiny fairy, who seemed really excited that she could see it. The next day, the entrants in the music competition, who are decided by the school, are announced. Hino's name appears on the list - except she doesn't play an instrument. The fairy gives her a magical violin that can be played by anyone. Reluctantly, she enters into the competition and is forced to deal with the prejudices of her peers.     kamichama karin- Karin Hanazono is an orphan, living with her relatives. Her life has never been easy, her studies are not well, she is not the best in sports and technically she is miserable. Left with only a ring as a memento from her departed mother, she suddenly finds her life changed, as she was mourning her pet cat, Shii-chan. On that night she met a strange boy, Kazune Kujyou. After that event, she experiences several mysterious incidences that soon led her to find out that she is a little goddess. Finding others like her she soon sets out to understand herself better as her mysterious powers grow and she becomes beset by opponents.     kodocha-  Sana Kurata has a charmed life. Not only is her mother is a famous, award-winning writer, but she's the star of the hit TV comedy "Child's Toy" while still in the fifth grade. But Sana's biggest concern is Akito Hayama, a pint-sized hellion who's organized the boys in their grade-school class into a mass of unending noise and violence. With the help of Rei, her manager, chauffeur and "pimp," Sana is determined to win back control of the classroom from her new arch-enemy. But as her crusade continues, Sana moves further into Akito's life, and finds that he might not be entirely bad...or entirely safe.     super gals- Ran Kotobuki is the self-proclaimed world's greatest gal, and she lives to shop, eat, and have as much fun as possible. But she's not all faux nails and Hawaiian jewelry; in the midst of all of her goofing off, she protects Shibuya from all manner of undesirable people, and she often devotes herself to helping both friends and strangers out of trouble, big and small. Of course, she'd rather be eating free food and scoring good deals on clothes,

b5vZyDCeaa	It's supposed to be 'Empact'. And even if it was 'Empack' it wouldn't really matter. Marshal Mathers is one of the sickest lyricists, in my opinion, and alot of others share that opinion. He'd drop a million rapping about a ******* carrot stick.     I'm excited about the album.     :D     |`|3JYgQQ5taa	We've already established this|`|L6mAGp5Yaa	I thought it was 'Empact'    x|`|50bf0c077c988dfd8103d66902b66326aa	no, he can do better.

U0ACGEX9aa	that's tough...Nas has the best hip hop album of all time (Illmatic) and 3 of the top 10 verses/songs of all time (If I Ruled The World, The World Is Yours, and Verbal Intercourse), BUT    I think I hafta give it to Jay-Z because he has three classics (Reasonable Doubt, Blueprint, and Black Album) and two just-missing classics (Volume 1 and American Gangster), so he gets it for consistency and longevity...AND he has more number 1 albums than Elvis, that's gotta tell you something|`|w4MvA4Rgaa	I Promise you it's going to come down to these 5 like 90% of the time    2pac,Biggie,NaS,Jay-Z,Rakim    I say it's Biggie    Occasionly you'll get a retard that says Lil Wayne|`|HL8W9yU6aa	thats a tough one cuz u have to take some of the greatest producers into consideration too such as dj premier, dr. dre, j dilla, madlib, rick rubin, hi tek, kanye west, mf doom. or some rappers (slash) producers like eminem or kanye. my choice would go to dj premier.|`|WWYEg2axaa	2pac|`|1luRrZyqaa	Chuck D|`|pA0pm0VNaa	i dunno...but because in my eyes he's the best and my favorite..i'd say jay-z....but i also like rakim, slick rick, nas, tupac, biggie..u know|`|Pwh9bDdKaa	Personal opinion, The Game in his younger years.|`|w3XRYjWjaa	Not of all time, but very good for me would be Ice Cube.

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	I miss it too.  :-(    We won't have a full series until 2010.    We'll have a Christmas special in 2008 and four "special" episodes during 2009 in the meantime.  All the specials prior to 2010 will star David Tennant as The Doctor, and at this point the public doesn't officially know if he'll continue on in the role, though Tennant did comment on the series 4 DVD that Steven Moffat is his "new boss", and Moffat doesn't "take over" until series 5.    Let's all hope he stays.  He's been pretty impressive as The Doctor!|`|2kpr2arRaa	2010 is the next full  Series--in 2009 there will only be a Few "Specials" and the 2008 Christmas special that is already filmed--    David Tennant is busy doing Sold Out Theater work ( shakespeare) in he UK and will be doing so till Early Jan 2009 when he will start filming the Specials to be shown Later in the yr.    |`|k0CQXeTeaa	Not until 2010.  This next year, instead of a regular series, the BBC is putting on four specials, the first of which starts on Christmas.  It kinda sucks, but from what I've been hearing about the actors involved in the specials, they're going to be pretty big.|`|s6lSGcVsaa	There will be a Christmas special in 2008, another in december 2009, and four more special type episodes during 2009.  Full 13 episode season in 2010.  How far off the Sci Fi Network schedule is from the BBC 1 may be differnt than the 2 weeks behind it was this past season.  Russell T Davies has left, but Phil Collinson is taking over as Exec Producer, and will also continue writing.  |`|ElH0qr8Naa	2009 - specials 2010 full series again

AA12193030	Since I've seen the movie twice, I believe it's Third Day. They sing "Otherside" and "This Is Who I Am" in the movie. "Otherside" would be the most likely song for this scene.
0asH8dJiaa	I have to agree it might be Bat Country    but some really amazing songs would have to be  Unholy Confessions  Afterlife  Critical Acclaim and  A little piece of heaven     number 1 for me is Afterlife|`|kMU140I8aa	I think "Bat Country" due to the amazing, mind-blowing guitar solo!.  + the lyrics are awesome.
6cf321fc4fefa731bf43f0817f555918aa	Everyone can find their own "meaning" in a song.  Close your eyes: What do you see? What do you feel?  That is the meaning of the song to you.    I can't really help you define the meaning, I'm sorry, because everyone interprets music differently!  That's what makes music so beautiful.|`|ODedx7t4aa	The meaning is in the eye of the beholder, or in this case the ear of the listener.  It can mean whatever you want it to mean: to you.  No piece of music, instrumental or vocal, has any "correct" meaning.  As a composer, I can tell you that I have my own meanings for all of my works, but they might not be the same as what a work means to someone else. |`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	There is no meaning behind this 'piece' (it cannot be a 'song' as there is no voice and no words!). It is a piece of 'abstract' music (ie there is no meaning or story behind it - it is music for music's sake).    If you want to know what it makes me feel: sick to death of it. This piece gets asked about in theis forum approximately once every hour in here. However, no-one ever seems to notice the prompts to that effect when posting the next inane, pointless question about this musical trifle. Have you any idea how exasperating and boring that is for true music lovers? There are literally thousands of wonderful pieces of music out there and yet this trivial little 'canon' (it's actually not even a proper canon!) is the figure of obsession with many people.    Yes, it's quite pretty the first 11 or 12 times one hears it but really - can't you be a little adventurous and listen to something else?|`|0asH8dJiaa	I love this song, my band plays the rock version.  i play it on the piano.  I think it was first and still used in traditional Christian Weddings.    A poetic meaning could just be that because of the D tuning and chord progression it reminds me of a mellow occasion that has to do with love.|`|5wGhADSCaa	It is absolute music.  It needs no meaning, only order and beauty.    I don't care for it much myself, especially compared with Bach's or Handel's music, who are far better composers.  Listen to something else.|`|bkPlFI8waa	We can't help you because only you know what that piece of music means to you. And you can't ask the author for help because -as many pointed out correctly- this is absolute music and it's not intended to have a meaning. "Program" music (where the author does intend to carry a meaning) only became common in the Romantic age, and this Canon is baroque, way older.    But as long as you learned that not all music compositions are "songs", I'm happy.    Note to fellow commenters: poor Pachelbel is not to blame if this music is played to death. And give me being overplayed over being forgotten, anytime.     |`|AA11986349	It means Pachelbel wanted some $$$, so he wrote some music.

The characters become more open minded and confident together and in themselves.|`|6TAp4PB5aa	IS THAT THE MOVIE WHERE IN THEY WERE TRAPPED IN A SCHOOL OR SOMETHING AND THEY SMOKE POTS AND MESSED UP THINGS AND THE ONE TRIES TO BE A PSYCHIC BUT SHE'S A PICK POCKET...

Exploratory perhaps?|`|3sifF0Tjaa	The breakfast club in short is about a group of teens and they  only met once, but it changed their lives forever.  They were five total strangers, with nothing in common, meeting for the first time: a brain, a beauty, a jock, a criminal, and a basket case. Before the day was over, they broke the rules, bared their souls, and touched each other in a way they never dreamed possible.  Five strangers with nothing in common, except each other. The moods were many! the jock and the criminal had ANGER issues. The brain was nervous because he thought the other guys might find him nerdy and an outcast. The beauty was rather bitchy and uppity until she realizes she is not as perfect as she thought she was, and the basket case was exactly that! a nutt! lol a overall mood for the entire film would be "lonely"and "misunderstood." I would agree this is a movie about teen-angst!    they all just needed to feel loved and wanted and they found that in each other even though they at first never thought that they could be close friends because they were all so diffrent.

Ht1ssD6taa	I Google what kind of bird is Woodstock and this is what it said   Woodstock is a small yellow bird of unknown gender or species.    Though Woodstock is feathery, he or she is decidedly not featherbrained, oftentimes displaying uncommon common sense and wisdom above and beyond that of your average bird. (Although, Woodstock has been known for his or her clumsiness and physical 'sight gag'-style comedic gaffes.) Charles M.

Si la luz esta apagada y la bombilla caliente ser el A.  Y si esta apagada y la bombilla fra ser el C.    venga como tu me dijiste en el otro, ahora lo veran todos y se copiaran jaja|`|GO2eAjn6aa	es facil  vos encendes un de los 3 interruptores y lo dejas un tiempo hasta q la bombilla se caliente despues lo apagas y encendes otro interruptor y vas a la habitacion si esta  encendida es el interruptor q encendist y no apagast, si esta caliente es el q apagast y si no esta encendiada y si esta fria la laparilla esta conectada al interruptor q no activast...|`|5sSXZ1YTaa	me rindo dime la respuesta|`|rnhHCaeiaa	El que est ms cerca de la lamparita, o el que no est activado.|`|fL8Sex6Xaa	el den medio|`|ONsVdUhCaa	Si hay 3 interruptores, elige uno que sea el primero y lo enciendes.  Cuando haya pasado un buen rato, apagas ese interruptor y enciendes otro.  Entonces, entras en la habitacin.  -Si la bombilla est caliente -ms que ardiendo- el interruptor correcto es el primero que  encendiste.  -Si la bombilla est encendida, es el que acabas de encender.  -Si la bombilla est apagada, obviamente es el tercer interruptor, que an no has encendido.

Yo digo que es el primer interruptor..|`|REnDsYPCaa	Lo que hara es activar uno de los interruptores y esperar un rato, luego apagar ese y activar otro, dejarlo prendido y entrar.  Si el interruptor que prende la lamparita es el primero que active, al entrar a la habitacin la lampara va a estar apagada pero el bombillo va a estar caliente.  Si es el segundo, al entrar la lampara va a estar prendida.   Si entro y la lampara no esta prendida ni caliente, por descarte se que el ultimo interruptor (el que no accione) es el que prende la luz!    :P

vQsrGe0caa	What about laser tag?? It's inside and they have a really cool one that's like a midnight something so its in the dark.  It's pretty reasonable when your in a group.  You can make Army shirts maybe a green ones for the boys and a pink army shirt for all the girls.  I bought t shirts at Michael's for $2 bucks each when I made them for my boyfriend.  (But we went paint balling)  The cake you can have made by a local cake maker who can make anything you want.  For example...    http://www.viciousdelicious.com/Images/B...    Or you can make one yourself    They normally have pizza as part of your package so you don't even have to worry about that and also normally an arcade if they want something else to do as well.  We have a cool place here in town that have laser tag, go karts, putt putt, rock climbing and bowling!  Anyway just some ideas. I don't know what his health concerns are so hope this helps|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Here's some easy links:    http://www.ezpartyzone.com/cat_camouflag...    Another idea is to get some MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat).  I suggest the ice cream.    http://www.amazon.com/Freeze-Dried-Cream...|`|rJMkJ2Nxaa	you should have an army men scavenger hunt  hid army men all over the house    you could get toy weapons from the dollor store    get a camofluage cake and hid army men in the cake  or you could dig trenches in the cake and put them in there    maybe you could get ahold of some of the pre packed food things they have    just go to an army surplus store and see what you can find

She said that she has met people who once wrote their phone number on a scrap book that they gave the jonas brothers. Then a few days later jonas called the girl on her phone and thanked her for the scrapbook.   That is a true story too.

Talk to strangers.  Eat ice cream without a spoon.  When going bowling, use the gutters. ALWAYS.  Order from the little kids menu.  Never look both ways.   Read the last page of a book first.

Get a note from your doctor.|`|chlGzFQlaa	I do not think I could develop my maximum potential in her class.    I find myself unable to keep track with the fast pace of this teacher, and I from what I've seen and heard of the other one, I think I could do better in his/her class.    My present teacher's does not teach as accessibly as I would like him/her to.    ans mine  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|44fbG4IUaa	this teachers teaching method is hard to understand and i feel like i'm not learning anything. i would prefer not to fail so i would appreciate a different teacher.|`|LbbawO7naa	"Her teaching methods do not allow me to learn to my full potential..."

Also you could say something about how people in the class distrube you or something, problems with others students.     If your really really desperat to get out, get into a fight with another person in that class and then tell them that you can't be in the same room as that person. DON'T RECOMEND IT!!!!!!!! but its an idea    Hope this helps a little bit! And good luck!|`|m6IZpNJLaa	Be honest with them.  If you are not getting anything in class and you having problems be honest. Just say it is a personality issue.  Not every teacher will be the right one.  Tell them you really REALLY want To LEARN Spanish, but yu can't in the teacher's class.  But to ruin someones life by claiming sexual harassment or rape is wrong.  YOu will get caught in the end.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	My first question (which you will not like) is: are your doing the best possible job you can with the teacher that you have.    (yes you may have guessed I might be a teacher)    If you really do have a bad teacher (they are out there)  then the only legitimate reason I would accept is if you could    CONVINCE ME THAT YOU REALLY WANT THE BEST EDUCATION YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET, THAT YOU ARE WORKING AS HARD AS YOU KNOW HOW (and you better be "come to Jesus" honest) AND REALLY BELIEVE ANOTHER TEACHER WOULD HELP YOU BECOME A BETTER HUMAN AND A BETTER ACHIEVING  STUDENT.    AND YES, THE CAPITALS ARE BECAUSE I AM YELLING.    Ok, I am better now.  Sincerely, I have been told I am a really really good to great teacher.  Here is the deal.  I have 10 percent students that I would go to the mat for (work extra hard) I have 60 percent that I will do well for, I have 30 per cent students who have parents that are, at best "white trash" and the reason I know that is because the (nut)student does not fall far from the tree.    As a teacher, there is nothing, within school, that I value more is a student to tries really hard, is respectful (or at least not a jerk), and is smart enough to understand it is going to be a cold day in hell before you can fool me.    If, in your heart, you have a "bad teacher", and your are, in your heart, a student who is not making excuses for your own shortcommings  then I bless you attempt (and I hope you get) to find a new teacher.    This one comes from a pure heart  Good luck, and do well|`|Cie6smHaaa	"My spanish teacher is hitting on me"|`|O0VQqIkDaa	You don't feel comfortable around her....so you can't do well.|`|CzUTBx1Aaa	just tell her the truth|`|cd37yLuZaa	say that you are considering a carreer that may need to use actual spanish as a language or you would like to know spanish because your are looking into studying abroad when you go to colledge and you need a better teacher.|`|X3wy0ulYaa	some1 annoying is in there or it would b easier or u just want 1.    thanks 4 the 10 points.|`|lWy5M1x9aa	Tell her that your teacher and you cannot get along.|`|XTgI7BGkaa	You are not comfortable in that class and are likely to do bad and that if they don't change you immediately you'll tell your parents about it. It worked for me.|`|YJcd8OAeaa	say why you are doing poorly in her class and show class results. if they are low too, then they will switch you|`|ZArYUIMcaa	my teacher isnt helping me at all wen i ask her to  and she doesnt explain anything  thats y my grades are dropping  or say she touched u, but that could get er arrested or something|`|I1wwpx69aa	There's someone in that class that you don't get along with & afraid of...you just want to prevent any problems.|`|2aJ7gHQgaa	Maybe you could come up with something about her teaching style and your learning style...like maybe she teaches only by writing on the board and lecturing, but you learn better by actually interacting, practicing, and doing something active like worksheets or skits.  Good luck!|`|kktoXldiaa	Try telling them that you just dont get along well with the teacher and that you would really like to switch to another spanish class,if that doesnt work tell them that you need to go to a easier spanish class. Dont say that the teacher was touching you in places cause that'll start a lot of confrintation that invloves courts,the police and everything and plus it's lying. Good Luck!!!|`|shvhgzXeaa	Say that you don't feel that your progressing with your spanish and that you feel by changing tutors that you may progress from the standard of Spanish that you are at the moment to a higher level.|`|NEEVRp16aa	There is a personality clash that I fear will affect my grade in the course.|`|uSQxUHQHaa	omg i hav the same problem   i told them that my schedule was difficult and that i was all over the school cause i really am and its just 2 much work and im always runnin 2 get 2 my classes on time cause they are on opposite ends of the building and plus i got 2 go 2 my locker   or you could tell them u need an easier class   or you could ask them 2 change ur schedule around like switch your spanish class from one period 2 the other  hope it helped|`|RAsZw6CXaa	what really works is the excuse of sexually abuse, good luck. :/|`|P9inKWOaaa	try " she touched me in foreign places"|`|4jlPzCzLaa	she doesn't help me learn properly, and i'm hoping u (counselor) can point me to a teacher that can help further my high school education.    thats wat i say when i dont like the teacher lol :)|`|k42OcjGLaa	Trick question, there is no mature reason for that. I've had plenty of bad professors in school, get over it.|`|hkzfATiiaa	you cant consentrate in that class because the kids make u feel unconfortable|`|jERevyR8aa	i believe i could achieve a better grade with a different teacher.|`|efg6683aaa	"my mother had troubles with him/her in highschool, she doesnt like him/her"  =/|`|LxeCIuq7aa	say you dont understand her|`|XdKlsEgTaa	Alright, we will get you a better teacher together right everyone?|`|qPmPAhiwaa	Take a **** on your hand and walk up to her crying.. that works every time|`|06382CnOaa	say that you can't even understand her sometimes, like she's speaking a different language or something|`|TFnE3qisaa	I can't focus in her class... say something like she is really nice but you can't understand her and her teaching style is not meshing with your learning capabilities. You think that switching teachers might be the best thing to ensure your academic success.|`|tIllKbkoaa	my spanish teacher told me to stay after class layyed me down on the desk and took a dump on my chest.        anyone got a bonor?|`|r5ck3vaEaa	Find something negative she did to you, like insult your intelligence, or she was being racist-that always works for black ppl|`|FGokbh7gaa	say "i tried it for the first quarter and really couldnt get excited about it. i have no friends in any of my classes and i really want this to be a good year for me so pleeeeeeasssse switch me" i used it it works|`|65cBvdqraa	they have to do something immoral or illegal  other than that.... you're stuck till the end of the year.|`|ewU2kFBbaa	omg i dnt like my spanish teacher either!!!!!!! start crying and say she goes to fast with the lessons and i need some more time on ENGLISH STUDIES!!! ya thatll work|`|PxTLTTxSaa	You shouldn't lie (ie, sexual abuse) because this could damage her career. Just say you're struggling and think a different teacher would be equipped to help you. Counselors want to help you learn, so this should work. Just tell the truth.|`|n8EIxO9Faa	Say something to the effect of you'd prefer to have another teacher with another teaching style because you don't learn as well with your current teacher's style.|`|T2HaAJasaa	omgshh do NOT say that your techer abuzed you sexualy or in anyways,,,damn she\he could get in serious troulble like get arrested or idkk     you can ruin a persons life by a lie like that    im not kidding ive seen it happen    if you dont like her then tell your councler why make up something like that wont get the teacher in troulbe    but dont tell horriable lies just because you dont one of your teachers,,gahh dont ruin some ones life by ur greedyness  :]]    haha  anyways who likes their teachers    no one there all queers|`|SOkm1N3naa	you: i dont feel safe or comfortable around her  person: why?  you: i just dont im just having sometroubles at the moment (go a bit quiet)  person: alright then we will see what we can do  you: no! please just give me a new teacher i need to be able to learn   person: ok then     this way makes sure your teacher is in the clear about anything and u dont need evidence to back it up|`|sQ4p7tktaa	You can just let them know that you are not learning with that teacher, it is nothing personal against her.  It is just her style of teaching that you cant adjust to. Let them know you are very concerned about your academics and would like to switch so that you can focus on Spanish and doing your best.      Just be honest.     Is it that you just dont like her?     Have a great day!

I don't really know how to explain it but when you do something good for someone else when your bored or depressed (like reading to elders at a nursing home) you leave feeling so good because you know that they really appreciate it =) I played my violin with others from my orchestra for sick people, the elderly and employees who do nothing all day and they loved it. My advice is to do something that you know you will be appreciated for* because if you volunteer and do filing or sweeping or something simple you'll feel worse than you did before. =/  Hope i helped*|`|nBGjPwViaa	I think so -- if you are helping others you will feel good about yourself.  That can only lead to positive thoughts!  Also, you will quite possibly learn that the situation you are in isn't as bad as you thought - maybe you'll see that there are actually people who have it worse than you...not to belittle anyone's situation...What I mean is, it will change your perspective on things and that is what depressed people need...|`|6IHET4csaa	Any way to stay busy is a good thing.|`|IKCfT9tnaa	helping others will help you|`|1tlgYKROaa	that would help. actually getting really involved in almost anything will work.|`|L4Ky6SCqaa	To get involved period|`|XfwtYQu2aa	yes, find volunteer work or causes that you would like to do|`|bo9aoSXCaa	i can try the eamil sank------------ i live|`|mggll8dRaa	That will keep You Busy....!!
xXa3eQOeaa	Why do you "think" such a ridiculous thing? Nobody, in their right mind can honestly believe such a foolish thing. It's simply not possible for one man, regardless of their status, to do such a thing. Considering the Liberals are so fond of calling Bush "dumb". How can someone so dumb, accomplish a World Wide Recession?  I agree, the USA needs to refine it's Election process. I believe that "career Politicians" do not serve the people anymore, but simply do the bidding of whomever's pocket they are in. Lobbyists should be illegal as they ONLY represent Special Interest Groups, They interfere with the People's Business by "bribing" OUR Elected officials to work for THEM, instead of US!! I think OUR representatives should NOT give themselves "a raise", but should "ask US" for one! I believe "term limits" would bring back "service" in the public interest. Furthermore, I think once someone has "served" as a Congress-person, they should not "serve" in any other High-Office for at least 1 term, thus preventing "Career Politicians". The exception being from Vice-President, to President.  I could go on, but what would be the point?|`|JwDWwgIcaa	um....meow?    :D|`|a4fddaf6a1e7cc689b0611f98a1c96acaa	No, I do not think that he did.|`|hat60KYXaa	Not Bush's fault.

People who think so are clearly stubborn and/or supid|`|N1eWhoFJaa	I do not think it entirely his fault.  He did what he thought was best at the time by bailing out companies and that turned out to make things worse.  I don't think Obama would have done anything better.|`|bcNCTf0zaa	Bush caused this world wide recession? I do not believe so. I think if you would pay more attention you would see it's because of repossessions, unpaid loans, unions and so on. President Bush made one mistake that I can see: He gave the banks bail out money. 45 billion to City Bank. and what do they do? buy a 45 million private jet.|`|HI0oQriqaa	would you kool aid drinkers please check some facts before you blame Bush. take a look at the conditions when the democrats took control of congress in 06 and watch the economy go down under their control. read first then ask your misguided liberally slanted questions.|`|mlmSRkhGaa	I despised George Bush the entire 8 years.

Really?|`|AA11452530	i agree. But I feel it's the people's fault to. The reason we are in the recession is because of the tax cuts. Not really the first time but when Bush proposed it AGAIN while we were in a war. While we weren't in the best financial standing. But many people were in favor of the cuts, even though they favored the top 5%.     So if the people knew how economics worked, or if the people that did knew, but didn't spread the word, in the end i feel it's a good part our fault.|`|Y65A7oUqaa	this is ridiculous. the president always gets the blame. it isnt all his damn fault. these next 4 yrs are gonna be hell in that case. cuz barack osama is a muslim that is gonna turn his back on israel. he wants to shut down guantamono bay. and he is a racist.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	bill clinton laid the foundation by deregulation in the 90's|`|BY02DhfWaa	i think he should have been impeached 3yrs ago but then we would have been stuck with the moron chaney .|`|FSyaAnuKaa	He was a bad president, but it's not just his fault for the world wide-recession.|`|3buQDaRDaa	You can't just scapegoat Bush. Yes, he has something to do with it, but it just wasn't him. Dereguation began under Clinton (with Republican approval) along with "free" trade. Both of these things killed America.     Politicians will never listen to the people. We are pawns to their desire.|`|a118b8144112704be52f2ab81596333baa	Wow, I didn't really think that he had that kind of power.  Way to dismiss anybody's personal responsibilities for their own actions.  I guess I can blame Obama rather than myself for not doing anything for the next four years.  Thanks for your permission on that.
Hfqp8b11aa	You won't be able to.  They only do this song LIVE, so that means there will always be a crowd in the background.  They also did Emergency, which I think is that song you're talking about, during another tour in Anaheim, but the screaming was I think even worse, so The Final Riot version is going to be the best one you can find.    Sorry..

I prefer Fire and Desire. Breaking up to make up could be good until it turns into a habit, then it no longer feels good, and could possibly turn into a permanent break up.    Cheers amor =)|`|VsamHLPOaa	I would have to say Fire and Desire. My mother loves that song. Know all the words. Well actually its a love/hate thing. On the one hand its a good song but there's only so many times you can listen to it before you want to scream.|`|gwjBvXTbaa	I couldn't say.

V1jUg7nZaa	Yeah, I had a cat a little while ago who truly felt like a best friend to me no matter what everyone else said. I was really depressed 5 years ago and she was a stray cat who just started coming to my house for some reason so it was kind of like she was sent to me for comfort. She was the sweetest cat ever. She never tried to hurt me or scratch me. But last year my stupid dad let her out of the house and then left her alone and ignored her and she got attacked by two pit bulls and died. That was probably my saddest day ever. I'm glad you have your cat at least.|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	My dog.|`|WAzoKgQ2aa	yes.      he is 2 years old but July 4th he will be 3.      he loves to give kisses, and he plays alot,    he  makes me laugh at times,    and smile at other times,    my heart would be sad if i didn't have my dog:]|`|AA11609168	Yes    german shepherd named tasha|`|cb9626d7fa143d0ce804d5d769640d45aa	yes, my canary was truly my best friend. i know he was a bird, but i really loved him for a million different reasons. he died about a year ago and i still miss him so much.|`|QskM0Mfsaa	at one point in my life my dog JO was my only friend|`|fFe75M3Baa	My imaginary cat, Buttons. I was the youngest of eight. Too many kids, so I couldn't have a pet. I had Buttons and she was my best friend. Eventually (as my siblings started moving out),I did get a turtle, then a dog and the live pets were never my best friend.    I think I resented the fact that I had to actually take care of the real pets.|`|gt3PYqkFaa	My dog|`|AA11537389	Not my best friend, but my Persian cat Magni is better company than most people I know.  lol|`|sPScyaF6aa	Always and Forever!

She always helps me stop crying and she loves to give me kisses. We even share my ice cream together! I love her to bits! I love all animals!

Not "Nicolette" or "Collette", but Nicorette, like the stop-smoking gum... When I asked her why she had this name, she said her mom was trying to quit smoking.    Ouch.    This is why people should either a.) not have kids, or b.) not name their kids after cities, states, geographical locations, sand dunes, elements, fictitious characters, inanimate objects, or anything other than a person's name.    I'm going to go with "a" on this one.|`|yOYZZZ1laa	Le-a  [Ledasha]|`|HEuwAouhaa	Gurzeil|`|r5wK05N5aa	Pyramid, his fathers name is Egypt.

We played it new years eve and all cousins played and when my cousin dared my other cousin to dance she dropped out and then 2 more dropped out because they dint like dares and then there was like 3 people left and it wasnt fun anymore . . . they shouldnt do that it annoys me sooo much its like why did u play it the first place  . . .|`|ttYJYvExaa	It depends did they really want to play truth or dare? lol or did everybody else make it hard to say no people can be so annoying with those games lol. If they wanted to then they should do the dares but like someone already said some dares are really dumb and probably something you wouldn't even want to do. I personally like truth you can find out so many things about people lol most people can do stupid things.|`|AA10799773	haha, yeah it does. but what about when you play, and people come up with dumb dares...then it's no fun at all|`|mggll8dRaa	Yes, not fair...!!|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Yes it does lol!|`|YvOm6u65aa	Yeah!

vqSkOICGaa	I'm glad you have no desire to do drugs or drink. it's a waste of your life. I only drink once in a blue moon and I do mean RARELY. tonight just happened to be one of those nights but I don't drink to excess anyway, not my style anymore. good for you! Stay clean and sober. it's the best way to be. and no, I don't get tired of hearing about drugs, drinking or being high because I don't hang out with people who engage in those activities(besides drinking sometimes) and when I hear about it randomly at work or something, I just ignore it because I know those things don't have a place in MY life anymore.|`|0lV2C78xaa	That's high school for ya.    I smoked a lot of pot in high school but I never did or had any desire to do hardcore drugs. I drank a few times, but I can count them on one hand.|`|OJAC44eTaa	Well, then don't do it! There you go, you've answered your own question.|`|38rwVxqmaa	yes actually  its getting annoying|`|DH6GMCdfaa	Those people have nothing better going on in their lives, drugs make them feel like they belong to something. To them its like they won the lotto when theyre smoking weed, or shooting up meth.     Be thankful you have a good life, and do not need the negitivity of drugs.|`|z61QnYRoaa	It's very smart of you.  I hope that you keep that mindset as you get older.    It took me a long time to get over drugs and drinking, and I wasted a lot of years messed up on drugs and alcohol.  I was completely obsessed with staying drunk and high all of the time.  I've been clean for 2 1/2 years now and don't ever see myself drinking or using drugs again.  It is not worth your time.|`|i3S10DUqaa	I do.  The bad thing is, I'm in college so I hear something about it nearly every day.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	i do, it seems a right of passage for some.  some just follow others.    i never drank to get drunk; did drugs in hs, but not much. Haven't done anything in years and don't feel the need. Prefer to be in control.  Wish there were more kids like you.    Life is short; don't mess up one minute of it.|`|4sW8MFxCaa	sure|`|paAtLUdwaa	you'll know once you try it|`|sVFkMVujaa	you "guarantee" you will drink?  hmmm.....    yes, i'm sick of it as well.|`|zH7VuQhtaa	Just ignore it all.

FZKFLTyLaa	My neck. It cures the massive headaches I get.|`|AeixtHvcaa	hmm idk,    I mean like if you crack your back then you can't really bend over and stuff and it hurts like crazy    Your neck is like the number 1 thing that you never try to break or crack because if you get it hit, then frist of all it'll hurt, and second your neck brings air to your head and it sends down the food from your mouth to your belly lol.     So I guess I would rather crack my back because I could just get a wheel chair.

Some may be genuinely concerned for the safety of their viewers. Personally, I love the snow -- an empty parking lot w/ 3-4 inches of snow is a target of opportunity for "doing doughnuts" w/ the car! ~:D>|`|MmSnJBORaa	because they're losers.

It's actually my second favourite song, after this one...    [Verse 1]  Is there anybody out there?   That wakes up with a bitter taste?  It's a king that we put up there  And he's a short way to fall from grace  It's slowly filling upward.  You can stand but you have no ground.  I hear it from the lost words.  They say it's time that you lost your crown.    [Chorus]  Don't be so greedy.  A dollar's a penny to you  When hearts are beating  Say what you want 'em to do.  Wasting away... I see you.  When the top of the world falls on you  Finding a day, don't wanna be you  When the top of the world falls on you    [Verse 2]  Is there anybody out there?  That can see what a man can change?  It's better that you don't care  Because he knows that he's in his state  I feel the paranoia.  When there's a time, put you in your place  In the eyes of those who watch ya  Well they can wait 'til you hit your face    [Chorus]  Don't be so greedy.  A dollar's a penny to you  When hearts are beating  Say what you want 'em to do.  Wasting away... I see you.  When the top of the world falls on you  Finally a day, don't wanna be you.  When the top of the world falls on you    Paint yourself a picture  When you waste another picture  And you win, and you win, and you win  Paint yourself a picture  And then you break another picture  And you win, and you win, and you win  And you win, yeah you win, and you win     [Chorus]  Don't be so greedy  A dollar's a penny to you  When hearts stop beating  Say what you want 'em to do  Wasting away... I see you  When the top of the world falls on you  Finding a day, don't wanna be you  When the top of the world falls on you    Wasting away...

I wrapped a hand around its stem  and pulled until the roots gave in,  finding there what I've been missing.  And I know....    So I tell myself, I tell myself, it's wrong.  There's a point we pass from which we can't return.   I felt the cold rain of the coming storm...    All because of you,  I haven't slept in so long.  When I do I dream  of drowning in the ocean;  longing for the shore  where I can lay my head down.  I'll follow your voice;  all you have to do is  shout it out!    Inside my hands these petals browned;  dried up falling to the ground,  but it was already too late now.  I pushed my fingers through the earth,  returned this flower to the dirt;  so it could live, I walked away now.  But I know...    Not a day goes by when I don't feel this burn.  There's a point we pass from which we can't return.  I felt the cold rain of the coming storm...    All because of you,  I haven't slept in so long.  When I do I dream  of drowning in the ocean;  longing for the shore  where I can lay my head down.  I'll follow your voice;  all you have to do is  shout it out!    All because of you.  All because of you.    All because of you,  I haven't slept in so long.  When I do I dream  of drowning in the ocean;  longing for the shore  where I can lay my head down.  Inside these arms of yours.    All because of you  I believe in angels.  Not the kind with wings,   no, not the kind with halos;  the kind that bring you home  when home becomes a strange place.  I'll follow your voice;  all you have to do is  shout it out!

And from the shelter of my mind  Through the window of my eyes  I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets  To England where my heart lies.    My mind's distracted and diffused  My thoughts are many miles away  They lie with you when you're asleep  And kiss you when you start your day.    And a song I was writing is left undone  I don't know why I spend my time  Writing songs I can't believe  With words that tear and strain to rhyme.    And so you see I have come to doubt  All that I once held as true  I stand alone without beliefs  The only truth I know is you.

73A0T8ltaa	Yes I agree that humans originated somewhere in or near Africa.   --------  Maybe the ones who migrated farther, and in different environments had to use more critical thought in tackling those environments etc.  Therefore increasing the need for cranial/brain capacity?  --------  Diet may have played a major role, for instance; those who ate more fatty foods, esp including fatty acids may have had increased brain tissues/function. Say coastal dwellers who ate whales, fish. etc  --------  I suddenly thought of that movie: "The Gods Must Be Crazy"  IDK why. LOL|`|D9k5Fou5aa	I believe in it, but I don't believe that it has anything to do with race...at least in the beginning. Many ppl assume Africa is black, but back then, it wasn't.

He helped the gang even when they were against him.  6._ Azula - Crazy and egocentric, in my eyes she's kinda spoiled.  7._ Ty Lee - Cheerful and kind, I don't even know why she's with Azula.  8._ Mai - Stoic and indifferent though she actually cares for her friends and Zuko.

4aabdcc54a3265aeac130b84280cf449aa	I hope what he agreed to was to give you personal time, not to give you time to lose weight.     If the two of you got on well, your weight gain shouldn't be an issue. If you have a good personality, then that's what he was friends with you for in the first place.     Also, don't go into meeting with him in hopes that he'll sweep you off your feet. I know that would be nice, and you feel like it would cure your depression, but you cannot expect love from an old friendship. Go expecting friendship and nothing more. When you have come around to truly expecting just a friend, then you'll be much happier to meet him...and your weight won't matter at all.   Of course, if romantic things have been discussed while talking to him, then there's even more of a chance of setting yourself up for disappointment. It's sad, but very true.     Go and meet him as soon as you want. But really, expect a friend. If something more comes of it, GREAT! But expecting more in the first place CAN lead you to feeling rejected.   But it sounds like he won't reject you as a friend.     As for the weight, really, if he cares for you (who you are, not what you look like, as these are majorly different), then the weight won't matter a thing.   (When I met my guy, I was about 210lbs. He's seen me now under 200, and up to 225 now due to meds. He thinks me as sexy as the day we met, and thought I was super sexy, even when I saw a disgusting, multi-colored (vitiligo), acne-covered BLOB when I looked in the mirror. He had it bad for me from the get-go...and I got a ring this past Xmas Day!)    So really, I know you don't want to hear this, but if he judges you by your weight gain, then he's no good for you anyway.   Your scar is part of who you are now. I personally have two skin tones and think I look like a freak, but really, nobody notices it. So even if you think your scar is horrendous, I would guarantee you that nobody thinks it's as bad as you do.     Anyway, feel free to Email me if you ever want to chat. (I never say that to anyone on Y!A)  I wish you the absolute best.   Remember: you really are more beautiful than you let yourself believe.   |`|9CCtt077aa	Why don't you believe him? Give the guy a chance. Some men are actually nice people. lol You're lucky you survived the car accident. You should be grateful instead of hating your body. Stop obsessing about the weight.

Well now that excited the plumber and I burned Mrs. Green's cat. Don't try the last pickle in the jar because the paddle was broken last weak. Don't do drugs stay a fool.

EFgKYxPfaa	My dear koko, you may not have problem with them but have you ever seen what could happen?    I have to help keeping one alive waiting for a paramedic to arrive when his car rolled right in front of my house. He was using a mobile phone. It was not a collision. It was a ONE car accident and the only conclusion that we all can come up with was he was talking on the phone. (There was a phone - totally smashed of course, on the road near the car)    As far as your point about keeping their eyes on the road - that also COULD be dangerous. One woman WAS concentrating on the road at the intersection in front of her (while talking on the phone) to see if the space was clear to go across the highway that she forgot to look to her right to see the THREE LANES on-coming traffic. It was by a miracle that no car - including mine, smashed into her. The sad part is, she had no idea what just happened and continued on her merry way - all the while kept talking.  Realistically - she would have been killed.    That's my take on the issue. Hope we can agree to disagree.|`|de7bf90bb2066bf0f7dc80a921ffc779aa	It's very dangerous, I saw an accident where someone was killed while talking on the phone.  I still have nightmares about it.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	after almost being hit many times, it should be banned.|`|QEqGukjZaa	its good if your stuck in traffic, but its not good anywhere else..|`|19fve4Lhaa	it is against the law where i live|`|lEjYhwxkaa	I think they should ban it.

u1t12bsAaa	Yes, many years ago. The person who outbid me was also a seller who had just sold me an item she did not have in her possession. She said she hoped to get it "soon". She gave me a negative feedback rating (the only one I have ever gotten) for failing to pay for the item she did not possess. The trick to Ebay is to decide how much the item is worth to you and bid that limit.

THE POOPIE LIST    GHOST POOPIE: The kind where you feel the poopie come out, but there is no poopie in the toilet.    CLEAN POOPIE: The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper.    WET POOPIE: The kind where you wipe your butt 50 times and it still feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and your underwear so you won't ruin them with stains.    SECOND WAVE POOPIE: This happens when you're done poopie-ing and you've pulled your pants up to your knees, and you realize that you have to poopie some more.    POP-A VEIN-IN-YOUR-FOREHEAD POOPIE: The kind where you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a stroke.    LINCOLN LOG POOPIE: The kind of poopie that is so huge you're afraid to flush without first breaking it into little pieces with the toilet brush.    GASSY POOPIE: It's so noisy, that everyone within earshot is giggling.    DRINKER'S POOPIE: The kind of poopie you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the skid marks on the bottom of the toilet.    CORN POOPIE: Self explanatory.    GEE-I-WISH-I-COULD-POOPIE POOPIE: The kind where you want to poopie but all you do is sit on the toilet and fart a few times.    SPINAL TAP POOPIE: That's where it hurts so badly coming out, you'd swear it was leaving you sideways.    WET CHEEKS POOPIE (The Power Dump): The kind that comes out so fast, your butt cheeks get splashed with water.    THE DANGLING POOPIE: This poopie refuses to drop in the toilet even though you are done poopie-ing it. You just hope that a shake or two will cut it loose.    THE SURPRISE POOPIE: You're not even at the toilet because you are sure you are about to fart, but *oops* --- a poopie!|`|bfb1d3f4961608dfad0375bd5f169b0aaa	One should announce it.  and move on to something one is feeling.|`|9c7a3bd67fbfe6f08d3a5f7e9144b19caa	Pop in a porn.|`|UUKWOWhnaa	Move ones hands lower.|`|rEELErf5aa	forgive me for this:   Try another hole.|`|8a262a9c5496ee057e063ab90852f0c4aa	She: I didn't realize your organ was so small.

One of my habits is drinking a can of some kind of caffeine containing carbonated drink on the way to work. While I'm drinking it I drive with my left hand near the 9 o'clock position, and hold the drink in my right.   Most of the time I have both hands on the wheel at about 9/3.|`|0G96V7Kbaa	I would like to believe this is one of my good driving habits.  I know driver's ed teaches the ten and two positions.  For me, I drive with one and two hands on the wheel.  One hand will grip, not lay on the wheel, not using finger control, but actually gripping the wheel.  The reason for this is because I believe it assist with me keeping control of the steering wheel.  Sometimes I drive with one hand.  But, I still grip the wheel.      One hand will always be placed around the ten or two positions.  The other hand may be placed at the nine or six positions and may also be a loose grip.    I have friends who drive using their fingers or by laying the wrist on the wheel or grabbing the bottom portion of the wheel.  I believe this is a formula for disaster waiting for a place to happen.|`|Upk0n5Z0aa	1 and left I keep the right next to my pistol.|`|MjDD7P8aaa	1. I drive with both hands on the steering wheel for better control.  2. One can drive with one hand on the steering too but it should be ensured that the hand(s) hold the steering wheel at the top and not at the sides or bottom. In the beginning it my seem difficult but later you would realise that your vehicle control is much better with the steering held at the top.|`|8MUj24s6aa	I actually drive all the above.    When it is one hand I alternate usually holding 7 o'clock or 5 o'clock or 12 o'clock with my left hand.     If both handed it is same positions or 9 and 3. But this is based on winter driving...

I can notice when they are down|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	This is a virtual site on the internet. It is not actual life. If my contacts change moods, it is FAR less important to me than if the real people I know in actuality, whom I increasigly feel less and less about to begin with, change moods, have a tendency to be mercurial. Actually, Life overall is very boring to me at the moment, so whatever people want to do in the realm of the virtual or in actuality, make ANYMORE, sorry to say, very little difference to me. Life is not worth all the wear and tear people cause it. I'll sit by on the bleachers and simply observe without participating. Sorry, but that is a blunt truth I've only just recently discovered of myself. So, that's the way it is Scooter!|`|CIWd3vJIaa	Yes, I can.  It is scary.  But, I can feel it.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Sometimes.  I was just wondering if they could tell the same thing about me....|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	Yes.  With some of them.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	It depends.  For most contacts, no, but for a select few, yes.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Yes I do know.|`|aUyopOWiaa	With some of them, I can.|`|vIcOdePzaa	No but I really wish I could.|`|yZD0f5tzaa	Hm...

qmXFCVMIaa	in a few episodes of the Xmen tv show he did hang out with captain america, but marvel has people in different cities also  like in one of the fisrst spiderman comics he tries to join the Fantastic 4. then there is the hulk VS wolverine comic they had...I don't think they are really in a different year ...i remember an episode of the amazing spiderman where he meets ironman ...i think they are relativly in the same year but due to location only meet up every now and then|`|BTvSJcFlaa	In the comics, they are all in the same year.
49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	my favorite documentary is called "strong enough to break" and it follows my favorite band through the journey of splitting from their label and starting their own indie.  it was originally intended to just showcase the process of making their third album, but it turned into something much larger.    you can watch it for free... they released it as a docu-series podcast on iTunes and it's on youtube, as well.  on iTunes, it's under the "taking the walk" podcast, so you can search that, but if you search "strong enough to break" you just have to click on the "taking the walk" podcast button.|`|NcufdPaAaa	If your from the Uk,  They have some great Documentaries on channel 4 and E4 every night!  There was one today about the most intelligent children in the world.|`|AA10227142	Johns not mad    Its really good.....you can watch it in sections on youtube.     Its about a young boy in the 70s with tourettes, then theres a follow up 15 years later called the boy cant help it and it show him at 30 or something. Its a really good watch :D    I really enjoyed it.|`|tvdabilNaa	Try the series: Seven, Fourteen, Twenty-one..... It chronicles the same group of peoples lives on a periodic basis.  I don't remember if those are the exact titles, but that is the gist of it.

And I thought Sheffield was bad, Lmao  I drive on the left...... I think Hahaha !|`|jCFWPWpUaa	AS I'm in the UK, I find it's best to drive on the left.  I did live in Germany for 4 years though, and drove on the right there. Although one time, I turned from one road into another and forgot. I ended up on the wrong side of the road. I didn't realise until a car came towards me.    I say it was an easy mistake to make as I was driving a right hand drive car.|`|it3ecbVEaa	god that reminded me of the first time i went to malta, you had to give way to the traffic coming off the side roads when you were going round the roundabout.  it confused the hell out of me...|`|BrHcx9jraa	there are sides?|`|4PWZmVZ4aa	in india we drive on left side    yes buddy  people are crazy here    roads are worse  we don't have any exotic  muscle or tuner sports cars available in india    neither we have motor bikes.|`|WiXVQEPjaa	Bloomin hell their insane, imagine crossing that road, i,d be dead in seconds, xx|`|eaYdc3c8aa	that is crazy!!! lol  UK left side.|`|y9GsC7ogaa	The correct one.|`|p0c4mek6aa	On the proper side.

I mostly need to get more fit, work harder on my education, finish the book I am writing (which has to do with my being lazy), get in better touch with God, get off the CPU a little, be more peaceful ,and be a better Vegan (I am only the hippie part). And after THAT there would be infinite things I could still strive to accomplish. And it is the same with us all. :)|`|h6wDmUMWaa	well i'm diabetic and i sometimes secretly eat sweety stuff which i'm not supposed to and it could wreck my future life, so yeah i should and yeah i need to!|`|UPdJF0tyaa	yeahh|`|WiXVQEPjaa	Yes i do, i would love to be more food healthy, i eat a lot of rubbish and i shouldnt, xx|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Yes|`|aSkRi1J4aa	Yes, if i really put my mind to it      and yea, i do need to.

U0FgxEJxaa	I am to a certain extent.  I don't look through their things as much a I look around......to see what kind of housekeeper they are, how they decorate their home, etc, etc.  It's fun to see other homes and I can get ideas from looking at theirs.  This is terrible, but on occasion I have looked in people's medicine cabinets (not often though).  Bad Iku, bad Iku!!    It's not bad that you snoop.  Just be careful what you look at, like private papers and the like.  But if that's the case and the stuff is that private, they can hide it somewhere.      Tayler, just don't get caught!|`|XNIkS3KNaa	I am, but not too the point where I look through their stuff. lol       I look at the surroundings, just not in or through anything. :)|`|y6406A92aa	Nah, I do that too, sometimes. Nothing wrong with being curious...is it?|`|f7a45ff7a84b6bc41b24e5538137c9edaa	Nope. Not in the least. Once my boss left his paycheck on his desk and asked me if I looked at it and I said no, I noticed it was a paycheck and I consciously avoided looking at it. I don't think he believed me, but it's true.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Lol Yes I am.     I think its bad because you're going through their stuff, unless you know them well, then I guess thats their call?    Lol, one time I was looking through one of my relatives house and he was like    "Do I go to your house and look through your stuff?!??!"  But it was as a joke lol    XD LMAO|`|l9uGrfSYaa	Hmm...I'm not that bad of an investigator, but I do like to research and study my surroundings.........notice bits and details here.     I don't think it's bad unto a point. If you go looking through drawers n stuff then I believe that's over doin' it (unless they give you permission). I enjoy looking at other people's family photos though (I mean antique ones hanging on walls). They just tell so much history. Same with antique furniture.     nya bya

IopM61XAaa	I would rather be experienced so on your honey moon your not trying to learn stuff, but then again its good to save it for someone special .|`|pjYQhPPBaa	Well let's put it this way: the only reason I'm a virgin is because I'm too tight for my boyfriend to fit in me (I'm 20! and yes, the pain is too unbearable for me to suck it up). But we are rather experienced for unwilling virgins hehe    My hope is that I would have lost my virginity to the man I'd marry, whether it be before or after we got married. And him the same (though that's probably unlikely.)|`|FGZR9RwDaa	i would rather be a virgin when i get married, and i would prefer my husband be the same.|`|BulOiEr3aa	i think i would rather be experienced so we could enjoy it more but i'll probably still be a virgin. even if i'm experienced i probably wouldn't have done it that much|`|tvdabilNaa	I would rather be experienced and NOT get married.|`|YTLePvkVaa	Virgin. Make it more special.|`|sO5KeGu8aa	Virgin, because then I wouldn't feel like a have anything to hide, or any STDs to worry about.|`|43JgLpkKaa	Virgin. it is meant to be that way. you should learn together on your honeymoon .
yBhL6helaa	Hell's kitchen. I have watched every season so far and it usually has minor differences. I love to hear these people complain about how big of an *** he is but it's like hello, you came on the show, you have seen it before why the shock, you know he is an ***. Kitchen nightmares grosses me out, it's hard for me to eat at restaurants after I watch that show. Those people on that show are really sick, and need to find another buisness besides food.|`|TvJ0K3xxaa	um that's hard but i do watch hells kitchen more cuz hes meaner than kitchen nightmares|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	KN.

NgkkzBOEaa	I'd use some kind of ion for the metal, as it would be strong.  I would just study the movies, and try to mimic the designs.  I don't remember what the Venus fly trap was, but are you trying to make a working angel trap (that with a key, you can escape) or the one that Jigsaw's assistant used to kill the person?  I think the only way you can get the designs for the traps would be to talk to the makers of Saw.|`|3aoiospGaa	Sorry to down your question,  but that might be just a liitle illegal.  Not to mention, kinda sick and twisted.|`|op7OZGSOaa	oh dude that's evil. sorry
qHhn3r4qaa	I had to deal with something like this recently. I tried to talk to her, tell her I was fed up with it, and she didn't listen. I gave her one last warning saying if she didn't change or apologize I was outta there. She didn't and I left. She seemed to realize I was serious after that. We have classes with each other, but other than that... I suggest talking to her. If she doesn't change back away. Breaking off the friendship suddenly and violently won't help really, it will just turn her on you specifically, try to gently pull away from her grip, and make a few new friends. That's the best advice I can give you.|`|yCkCqFmjaa	Slowly drift apart from her... just make other friends and slowly push her away... just don't push her out completely. If she's truly mean to you then you don't need anything to do with her. Just smile at her and say hi but don't constantly hang around her... just slowly drift apart.    God bless,  Secret Agent Bucktooth

GNtWomekaa	Try supporting your diaphragm with your hands while you sing.  Try breathing excersises to warm up your vocals and make sure you're singing correctly.  You're not damaging your vocals, you're just not singing right.|`|wxogugt7aa	You could be forming a vocal polyp which is like a callous on your vocal chords. You should rest them more often and warm up before you practice to avoid this because in some cases they require surgery for removal. You could just be practicing too much and your vocal folds are tired, so just give them a rest, drink tea, get to bed early and you should be fine by tomorrow! Good Luck!  Ps- if this continues for over 2 weeks with rest, go to the doc and let them check to see if its a polyp|`|yY8vnnPsaa	No, you are not damaging your vocal chords. I am a singer too, and have been singing since age 4. lol. But the reason we tend to lose our "crystal clear tone" is not because we are practicing wrong.YOu have been warming your voice up with practices and warm ups..therefore allowing your voice to warm up to its own tone. So that airy voice you have now is only your REAL tone..when warmed up. :) good luck|`|9TsdWBJBaa	Make sure you are not pressuring your voice. If you sing or practice to much, you can hurt your vocal cords. Try to go back down and possibly sing softer songs.

EbInCDHEaa	the last episode corresponds with chapter 155, though the anime just sort of cut it off at the end so that they could finish the series.    i hope that you are asking because you want to read the manga, because they ended the anime in the most terrible way. while the manga is still ongoing  (although the author has been taking a break due to injury i believe)

She's a wizard!|`|qK31iYRRaa	Well, if Bella is still human, Hermione will win, hands down.    But if Bella is a vampire, she's gonna kick Hermione's butt all over the place.    Both Series rock hard!|`|d5COR2S2aa	ooooooooh hermione. i just like hp better *shrugs*|`|By2QtFigaa	BELLA ALL THE WAY!!!!!|`|PIUAUgCaaa	Hermione! Of course she would win! She could just, like, poof Bella away.|`|c5VABL0oaa	Let's hope the both defeat each other, that way people can stop talking about them so much.|`|N73ahJ5Taa	Bella cuz edward always around her and would probably suck Hermione blood b4 the fight even starts cuz he reads mind.|`|EPWqhhJSaa	definitely Hermione   everyone likes Twilight, me, I'm more of a Harry Potter fan  plus, Hermione knows all those spells, she could kick Bella's *** any day|`|go1jIgbwaa	Hello!  Hermione can go all "Avada Kedavra" on her ***.  :D  Besides, as someone pointed out, Bella would just cry for Eddy to save her.|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	Hermione because bella will make the Cullen family save her like always... what a wimp|`|JGbSu74raa	Hermione with out a doubt she's got magic powers.

Hermione would kick Bella's ***. Unless we're talking about the post-transformed Bella. If she's a vampire in this cat fight then maybe she would win. . .|`|AA11965234	hermione would win because she knows every spell ever. (practically.)    bella could only save herself with her little shield thing, which probably wouldn't hold up well against magic.|`|SUHrx4Qpaa	Hermione would win cause she is pretty tough and just has to wave her wand. Bella is only harmful if she has Edward.|`|BBws5hl7aa	HARRY POTTER SUCKS------OH WAIT------TWILIGHT SUCKS 2  they both loose over me....everyone does....|`|LsUCS654aa	is this before or after bella is a vampire?  assuming she is a vampire i think if hermione said avada kedavra first she would win but she would have to be extremly fast. and if bella isnt a vampire then Hermione would totally kick her ***.|`|Ww9pdiGnaa	omg hermione! i absolutely love bella & twilight (also harry potter) but okay lets face it bella is kind of clumsy & not magical but she has edward&*SPOILER* she eventually goes vamp-o.  hermionie does magic and knows like every spell in the freekin world. she smart. shes pretty stable/not clumsy & yeah  but im not sure who would win if bella was a vampire... possibly bella.

tVpRHvboaa	Hi typhillips  Content is what I find the most important.And also that its rightly updated.I happened to discover this site today- downes.ca (to site an example), and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Its a personal website of course and I found it one of the best ever.    I don't find flash very impressive unless its absolutely necessary.  Useful outbound links are also desirable.Page rank or any other rank is the least important in any case.Load time yes -it needs to bearable.  Contact info is very handy all the time.I prefer optimal use of colorsOn the official BBC site (after it got redesigned last year) we can "change" the color -one feature which serves hardly any purpose.    Hope this helps!

g2GogSALaa	Uhm, they're generally considered more "Chinese food", but there are Vietnamese egg rolls, though they're called "spring rolls" and the contents are different.     Chinese egg rolls are usually filled with cooked meat and vegetables and deep-fried, while Vietnamese spring rolls are generally filled with raw vegetables, some form of seafood or meat, spicy sauce, and are wrapped in a white/clearish thing.    They taste really different, but both are really good :]|`|S1KINm2Paa	Chinese.|`|FAPBY6e2aa	All Asian countries use eggrolls so yes|`|RxHb1P4Faa	I think it is.|`|4ppR6hLzaa	both  but they are different in that vietnamese eggrolls have thinner wraps and aren't as crunchy. they also dont have meat.|`|qYPWKv6Faa	no, chinese

It's getting annoying.|`|R8iz9ZM1aa	heak yes!|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Yes. I count on myself and believe in myself.|`|2193c4e44db8189b4abf5d6676cc8346aa	depends on what the temptation is|`|aPaPlEiCaa	not at all|`|nANyAvzgaa	Uhm!|`|ckdYl9Znaa	I have inner strength to help me live every day to the best of my abilities, no matter what I encounter.  After breaking my neck, surgery added a titanium plate that holds my spinal column together.  The mask of fear on the quilt is replaced with a mask of renewal- healing growth.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	I regret to report - not as much as I NEED, but I am trying very hard to improve each and every day.  That is the real answer, I hope    Good question,  hope my answer (for whatever that added) helps|`|GwwcqUCoaa	Yes, and more than outer strength. Darn pickle jars.|`|W2qyu5zFaa	I would say so :)|`|WnG55RAlaa	some|`|PXarLma8aa	yes, I'm a survivor|`|EGuM1LU1aa	Yup. My heart just "beat" others, that's how "he" gets blood..! :D|`|jK8xy3VUaa	Yeah.

5ulr9xLQaa	I looked up one of my friends for HS, 23 years ago and she had really changed.  She used to be kind of Goth now she married a man from India and dresses in traditional Indian garb.  Most of my friends from HS have lost their hair or gotten fat, I have even gained 55 lbs since then.|`|CwHWLTN1aa	easy on the lazy eye jokes|`|ePT3hRO0aa	UMm  HELLL YEAH!  ..  i had a friend that i new since i was small.. like about 7, i actually by chance ended up going to the same school as her! which was pretty weird ..cause i was like what the hell is SHE doing in this school ..  (it was like in middle school)  and she changed a lot   ..  to the fact that i couldn't tell if it was really her!|`|LHDQiAA5aa	OMG yeah.  Its kinda sad becuase that happened to me with a family memeber and when I went to visit them it didn't seem like the same person, and all of our memories did't seem true. Also it hard when you dont see someone for awhile and when you do you wish they looked the same they used to and when you picture them thats who you see, when they dont look anything like that anymore.
8vGq6cRTaa	I love it. And a lot of other people did too. Crush has sold about 1.5 million copies so far.    You probably like it because it's a good song that everyone can relate to and it's catchy. It has good hooks (the parts of a tune that stick in your head).    Sorry you don't like David.  He's a bit goofy and spacy sometimes but he's one of the nicest guys ever and I respect his values. And he's funny too because he's so honest.    Check out his AOL Sessions performances including Crush (Next under the video goes to the next)  http://music.aol.com/video/crush-aol-ses...    And his new video for A Little Too Not Over You  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZZ3-T7nA...    And you can listen to all of his album's standard tracks here:  http://myplay.com/music/david-archuleta/...

uAyYRXnvaa	I'd start by going to the person's house and stealing their car or first born.  Leave a ransom note (with a phone number).  If they're clever and have moved, just go to all their regular haunts until you hear a voice you recognise, make sure you have a balaclava and mug them on their way to their new house.  If you still haven't found them then change your perspective and feel a sense of self-satisfaction that you have helped someone improve their lives......      You could also, of course, try looking ABOVE the cleavage line.|`|GunyunsXaa	I hate plastic friends|`|Cie6smHaaa	Get geico.|`|JyvG8dFcaa	lol.........|`|mhsVWUfaaa	you will not get your money back, FOOL!!!!|`|7aEHLolLaa	Beat the person that stole your money!( check there record!)|`|Z026qDC2aa	hahah good one!|`|AdGcqzwXaa	do you have her name or number if so you can fond out where she lives|`|PiORhwawaa	you shoulda asked for a pic before you loaned the money, guess you can kiss it goodbye...|`|HSVXaQPQaa	TAKE EM TO COURT|`|TtW7jExEaa	She's the one with boobs right under her chin, has duck lips,and her ears are pulled back to the rear of her head!!! xoxoxoxo|`|VFEZFanIaa	LOLING MY VAGINA OFF!|`|c3tADklmaa	Steal it, duh!|`|V9uMoELzaa	Always ask her for money!

bRoFUcIgaa	Yeah, I don't like Beyonce anymore. I used to be such a fan of hers back in Destiny's Child and when she first came out as a solo artist. However, she doesn't have any good material anymore and I feel she's been wasting her talent as she is talented when it comes to singing- no one can deny that but she hasn't been using the talent given to her properly.  She's also become pretty shallow/full of herself as I've read quite a few disgusting comments she's made, she is definitely a diva. She used to be so humble and sweet, I think success has gone to her head...|`|y9wE6Qm5aa	OMG!!   yes i do  Single LAdies-she is not SINGLE  omg  i atually hate all her songs but the new ones annoy the hell outa me|`|suCEU6xhaa	no|`|wmKb8LeCaa	I hate ALL Beyonce songs.

Ybro1x2aaa	I don't agree for the reasons that you give, but I think it has a bad influence on girls because its a stupid, horribly written book.  They should be spending their time on better books or drugs or something.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	omg i agreee!!! I LOVE EDWARD and i could care less if hes from a book|`|rHlmNoYUaa	They are just book haters... those are the people who ban books. I wouldn't be surprised if they banned Twilight, but there's no ban that can make me stop reading it! Disney movies are completely NOT bad influence because each one has a meaning to it that 'kids can learn'. Maybe we can put together a petition against those book-haters.

Ep0CpwDbaa	I'd have to say that far too much confidence is more unattractive. A cocky, conceited person can make people angry at them or feel bad about themselves; an unconfident person doesn't really have such a negative effect on others. Confidence can be gained with a little work, but once you have too much of it, it's hard to cut it down.|`|l1pewZpaaa	No confidence. Although I don't like either|`|47eaf46122c4f549d5ee0bdf2f43622eaa	far too much confidence.  those betches..|`|l2qtG4yfaa	No confidence at all|`|sVFkMVujaa	far too much.  stuck up, conceited, full of themselves people are irritating as hell.|`|a6UuiDMWaa	No confidence at all|`|3dREgrQ7aa	too much. being cocky/conceited is annoying majorr.|`|VwtMfZMmaa	too much|`|vy9EAvBvaa	Too much confidence|`|tV46QHgvaa	A lil too much can be cute and at least you can tease someone. But with no confidence, where do you go with that?|`|uFdOJnlaaa	far too much confidence|`|7aisLVeiaa	Far too much confidence is worse. Nothing annoys me more than arrogant people. They need to bring their asses back down to Earth and discover they aren't as terrific as they think they are. I'm not saying they shouldn't feel good about themselves, but they can be confident without being conceited.|`|UxSF3Doaaa	I have to say too much! I don't like when people feel they are above others, and above treating others right.    As for no confidence, well, some people may have no confidence because though many people with no confidence are deserving of good things and having their special someone, they have no confidence because they been let down by the social world or dealt with rejection too much. Too much rejection CAN kill confidence.|`|YL0DypySaa	No confidence.|`|p0zA0zyHaa	Definitely too much.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	That's a tough question...    But I'm gonna say too much confidence.    Usually, if someone has no confidence, there's no where to go but up so they're bound to get a little bit of confidence sooner or later.    But with too much confidence, most of the time they spend their lives like that.|`|RwY6mk43aa	far too much confidence. some one can gain confidence; but once they have too much its harder to stop being cocky.|`|c5VABL0oaa	Too much, by far. You can always coax someone out of their shell, but arrogance is tough to beat.|`|b65yrPX2aa	to much .. i hate cocky people|`|a2b5549c80fdb444d8075ce8c9c9d17baa	far too much confidence|`|LmxNw2YRaa	too confident. i hate cocky people    and if i liked someone with no confidence i could always increase itt, but you could never decrease it (without being mean)|`|O5gvRj8Naa	to much confidence

huSumDL5aa	stupid society and its closed-minded expectations. Ignorant people don't deserve to bask in our individuality :] Be who you are, and who you want to be, and that's all that matters.

Some time ago, there lived a King. This King should have been contented with his life, given all the riches and luxuries he had. However, this was not the case! The King always found himself wondering why he just never seemed content with his life.    Sure, he had the attention of everyone wherever he went, attended fancy dinners and parties, but somehow, he still felt something was lacking and he couldn't put his finger on it.    One day, the King had woken up earlier than usual to stroll around his palace. He entered his huge living room and came to a stop when he heard someone happily singing away, following this singing. The King saw that one of the servants was singing and had a very contented look on his face.    This fascinated the King and he summoned this man to his chambers.    The man entered the King's chambers as ordered. The King asked why he was so happy?    To this the man replied: "Your Majesty, I am nothing but a servant, but I make enough of a living to keep my wife and children happy. We don't need too much, a roof over our heads and warm food to fill our tummy. My wife and children are my inspiration; they are content with whatever little I bring home. I am happy because my family is happy."    Hearing this, the King dismissed the servant and summoned his Personal Assistant to his chambers.    The King related his personal anguish about his feelings and then related the story of the servant to his Personal Assistant, hoping that somehow, he will be able to come up with some reasoning that here was a King who could have anything he wished for at a snap of his fingers and yet was not contented, whereas, his servant, having so little was extremely contented.    The Personal Assistant listened attentively and came to a conclusion. He said, "Your Majesty, I believe that the servant has not been made part of The Club 99."    "The Club 99? And what exactly is that?" the King inquired.    To which the Personal Assistant replied, "Your Majesty, to truly know what The Club 99 is, you will have to do the following, place 99 Gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servant's doorstep, you will then understand what The Club 99 is."    That very same evening, the King arranged for 99 Gold coins to be placed in a bag at the servant's doorstep. Although he was slightly hesitant and he thought he should have put 100 Gold coins into the bag, but since his Personal Assistant had advised him to put 99 Gold coins that is what he did.    The servant was just stepping out of his house when he saw a bag at his doorstep. Wondering about its contents, he took it into his house and opened the bag. When he opened the bag, he let out a great big shout of joy...Gold Coins... so many of them. He could hardly believe it. He called his wife to show her the Gold coins.    The servant then took the bag to a table and emptied it out and began to count the Gold coins. Doing so, he realized that there were 99 Gold coins and he thought it was an odd number so he counted again, and again and again only to come to the same conclusion... 99 Gold Coins.    The servant began to wonder, what could have happened to that last one Gold coin? For no one would leave 99 Gold coins. He began to search his entire house, looked around his backyard for hours, not wanting to lose out on that one Gold coin. Finally, exhausted, he decided that he was going to have to work harder than ever to make up for that one Gold coin to make his entire collection an even 100 Gold Coins.    The servant got up the next morning, in an extremely horrible mood, shouting at the children and his wife for his delay, not realizing that he had spent most of the night conjuring ways of working hard so that he had enough money to buy himself that Gold coin. He went to work as usual - but not in his usual best mood, singing happily - as he grumpily did his daily errands.    Seeing the man's attitude change so drastically, the King was puzzled. He promptly summoned his Personal Assistant to his chambers. The King related his thoughts about the servant and once again, his Personal Assistant listened. The King could not believe that the servant who until yesterday had been singing away and was happy and content with his life had taken a sudden change of attitude, even though he should have been happier after receiving the Gold coins.    To this the Personal Assistant replied "Ah! But your Majesty, the servant has now officially joined The Club 99." He explained: "The Club 99 is just a name given to those people who have everything but yet are never contented, therefore they are always working hard and striving for that extra one to round it out to 100!    We have so much to be thankful for and we can live with very little in our lives, but the minute we are given something bigger and better, we want even more!|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	about that time i was livin in a van down by the river|`|CaHs4uloaa	man thats funny|`|hTuP1JWOaa	I tell people that In the middle of the night that some one comes into their house and steals all of their cookie crisp and they ttyl freak out and run home to lock up their fave cereal then i go over to their house and find their cookie crisp and hide it in the closest bathroom!!!LOL!LOL!LOL!|`|8wRvfMZZaa	I smell like cheese!|`|jK8xy3VUaa	Well it happened to me, it's when I climb a mountain, not by myself.

yOtCzNWTaa	I think that Johnny Depp is a very good role model. He has inspired me and many other people from the first film I saw him in. Although I do not agree that all of his films are family oriented, he has made some rather adult type films in the past, but nonetheless, whenever he is on the screen, it's hard to look away because he puts such raw emotion into his characters. It's like you aren't even watching Johnny Depp. He chooses the characters that HE wants to choose, not the ones that will make him popular or give him the most money. I have such deep respect for that.    And also, he came from "nothing". He was born in Kentucky to a poor type family and lived in a small desolate town in Florida, and his childhood wasn't that great, he went down a bad path, hung out with the wrong crowd and did drugs,  but put his act together and look what he became. He is living proof that it does not matter where you came from or what you came from, and also his transformation over the past few decades has been phenomenal.    And to me, the best is that he is not like other celebrities. He does not believe in actors competing at awards shows, he lives in a nice little village away from the paparazzi, he doesn't do his job for fame, and he has a passion for it, gives contributions to hospitals and sick children, and he loves his family      To me he is an amazing actor, father, and person altogether.     Thanks for letting me voice my opinion, I'm sure you feel the same :)|`|2rJwgk40aa	Yes.He does things he enjoys doing,rather then doing them because they will make him money.I think thats a great thing to teach people.|`|H4cxlpoaaa	Yes, Johnny Depp is a family man and if you notice most of his movies like the Pirates series he made were made so that his kids could go see them.  He truly is genuine and certainly a good rolemodel and mentor.|`|0ehkP9qMaa	YES!! because if everyone was that hot we'd never need make-up again!!    Ha ha    But as previously stated he is a good family man (making him even hotter) and such|`|6wHcU4Vkaa	YES!!!! he's my rolemodel!! he's such a good actor and singer and he plays guitar! i love him!! he's a great role model or young actors too! he always connects with the character he plays!

g2GogSALaa	Get bangs/fringe!    Maybe part your hair sideways & add in a few fun hair accesories like a headband or a barrette.    Straighten your hair for a sleek look, but if you want a playful, girly look, curl your hair loosely and tease your roots :]    Don't worry about the hair color, it'll fade out eventually. Also, be sure to keep your hair healthy! You wouldn't want it to make you bummed out even more.   You could try emphasizing your face or eyes more, so people don't really focus on your hair.

HE3IkyL8aa	Kristen Stewart has naturally green eyes. She wears brown contacts for filming to match Bella's eye color.    Taylor Lautner had to wear a wig for his role as Jacob Black.    For the role of Edward Cullen, Robert Pattinson flew from England to director Catherine Hardwicke's house to audition. There, he and Kristen Stewart, who was already cast as Bella Swan, rehearsed the "Love Scene"/"Meadow Scene" on Hardwicke's own bed.    When the 'evil vampires' make their first appearance, actors Cam Gigandet, Rachelle Lefevre and Edi Gathegi are all wearing little slippers painted like bare feet.    Kristen Stewart wore hair pieces so they didn't have to waste time doing her hair, and therefore had more time to shoot.    Before casting, Robert Pattinson had never heard of the Twilight novel. He only attended casting because he liked Kristen Stewart's performance in Into the Wild    Kristen Stewart's stunt double, Katie Powers, also plays a waitress at the diner. I didn't even know Kristen had a stunt double!    All of the Cullens can be seen wearing jewelry with the same symbol on it. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had the same wristband, and Alice and Rosalie had similar necklaces with the symbol on it; Esme had a bracelet and Carlisle had a ring.    When Bella and Edward are lying in the meadow, the sun coming through the trees makes a heart between them. Isn't that cute?    GOOFS:  In the scene with Edward and Bella talking in the cafeteria (when she drops the apple and he catches it) it is apparent that he has pit stains. Vampires don't sweat.    In the beginning when Charlie is driving Bella to the house he has his windshield wipers on and its not even raining.    When Edward is telling Bella "you better hold on tight, spider monkey" you can see his harness pulling his shirt up.    When Bella is in the ballet studio, she smacks her head against the wall and begins to bleed; however, when she's shown in the hospital, her head is not bandaged.    In the end, when Bella is in the hospital for the second time, Edward leaves lip marks on Bella's forehead when he kisses her. This is probably due to the makeup, including lipstick, Robert Pattinson is wearing to match the vampires pale complexion.      LEARNED ENOUGH? LOL.|`|eMMxXjaLaa	Jasper was meant to be taller than emmett in the movie, but he ended up shorter.

So far they don't have anything they can really use yet but they're working on it. I've heard that in the meantime they may do a slightly smaller movie so it may take a while for a third but since Dark Knight was the second highest grossing movie of all time, you can bet the studio def has plans for more.|`|lu6f9qsoaa	I heard something about them being Aaron Eckhart back to play Two-Face again, plus I also heard something about them either having The Riddler or The Penguin as another villian.

AA12134591	I have seen numerous celebrities in my lifetime  and have met a number of them personally  from a wide spectrum of notoriety...for I have   worked within the entertainment business for   a number of years... and for some time have   been a commercial photographer and have   been called on to photograph some of these   people....    I would give you a list... but I think that would   be a little like a "brag" session and I think that   would not be all that cool.... so, I'll just say that  among my absolute favorites and the ones that I  will cherish the absolute most for my lifetime....  are.... Johnny Cash ... Marty Robbins (country artists  both met while shooting for a production company some  years back)   Billy Gibbons of ZZ Topp....  Arsenio Hall  (while he was doing the Tonight Show in California)....   Larry McMurtry (author of Lonesome Dove and others)  John Lord of the Moody Blues.... and, my absolute favorite  of all.... Eric Clapton....absolutely one of the nicest people  that I've ever met !!    There are, however a few that I've met that I definitely   could have done without ever meeting... worst of all  was Freddy Fender... I found him to be an absolute   pig of a person.... and someone so caught up in himself  that he treated everyone around him like dirt !!    ? ////|`|u0xvF3UOaa	Mmhmm.

RFrwwd3naa	If you know that you are smart and could really succeed in a good school like Binghamton, DO NOT let anyone snatch your dreams away from you. Im sure you love and respect your parents but tell them that this is your life and your education and maybe bring them in to talk it out with you and your guidance couselor? Because if the guidance counselor feels the same way you do (which they will), they can convince your parents. But community colleges kind of prepare you- but since it is only a 2 year school you'll only be able to get your associates in nursing which wont be as meaningful as a having your BSN so i feel you on your situation =/ so just try that.. But dont be depressed.. you'll get past this little bump in the road*  Good luck and hope i helped*|`|4EflpUK8aa	I'm sorry for your problem. Maybe they don't have enough money to send you but they don't want to tell you that. I don't know why else parent's would want to hinder their child's education in such a way. How old are you? Can't you just get student loans and go anyway?|`|7e2fb8715a546f9994b1524bff38f6ecaa	Awwww I'm so sorry. I'm at Stony Brook University, and they have a reallly great Nursing program here. It is really competitive, but it's well worth it, and it isn't far from the city at all (a 2 hour drive). If not, try going to PACE, LIU, or Adelphi (if you can afford it). If not CUNY City Tech has a great 1 year program and from what I hear they just started a 4 year program. If that's not the case, you can always get your Bachelor's from another school.

It's got plenty of action, big explosions, one-liners and pure entertainment value. The plot is pretty good, somewhat original, and fairly fast-paced. The acting is good, and the film has a surprisingly large amount of well-known good actors; Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and John Malkovich. They all give good performances, as do most of the supporting actors.|`|5Hh4Stj8aa	Air Force One.

Zh7QcGLtaa	Haha! It's becasue NY is the bomb!!!!  |`|9KWVgb9naa	maybe  because dc & marvel offices are in  new york|`|6AxMy4WMaa	maybe because the place new york is the perfect place for the story or it could be the creator lives in new york or maybe the new york is the dream place for the writer?  !|`|p3CYaMLKaa	maybe its because New york is known by almost everyone and it is a city so a lot of crimes happen|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Mainly because alot of the superheros that are popular were created by Stan Lee.     Stan Lee lived in New York and writers tend to write about what they know. Obviously Stan Lee isn't going to write about a hero living in L.A. because he has no idea what a normal day is like in L.A.; he does, however, know what a typical New York day is.

ETFaQiTzaa	You know, one of the things I liked most about this movie was it's ability to get you emotionally invested in all of its main characters--even the villain.  It also managed to make me like Collin Farrel's role (which is an astonishing feat that only "Minority Report" had managed before "In Bruges")    All of the actors performed brilliantly, and all of the characters were unique, well-developed, with their own brand of humor.    That said, I'm going to -try- to remain as unbiased as possible when I say Ralph Fiennes as Harry Waters.  Some twisted part of me is always drawn to a good villain, and I often prefer them to the heroes IF they are unique, clever, and have a personality outside of just 'KILL--DESTROY WORLD'.  And Harry had it all.  He was an evil bastard, sure, but he "stuck to his principles" and I liked the idea that this ruthless murderer was appalled by the idea of killing women and children--that he saw it as an unforgivable sin.  "If I had killed a kid--accidentally or otherwise--I wouldn't have thought twice.  I'd have killed myself on the f*cking spot!"    I love that he had a life that was more than 'killer,' and showed his family and how much he loved his own children--so that the insulting of his children by Gleeson nearly sent him over the edge.    My favorite scene with him (other than his meeting with Ken at the outdoor cafe), is when he's destroying the phone.  "-YOU'RE- AN INANIMATE F*CKING OBJECT!"    Best.  Comeback.  Ever.  And the apology to his wife afterward...  Loved it.|`|2PFn8k4jaa	Oh I loved everyone in that :) but Ralph Finnes was awsome, it was so weird a character like that stuck to his word... what he did in the end... you know :) but then the other two guys..! I'll just say everyone was my favorite Lol|`|54yULzWRaa	I liked Colin Ferrel's character mostly because although he was a hit man, he still had morals and a conscience after killing the little boy; as well as ralph fiennes character. I especially loved the end because of the irony.|`|AeJrpZGqaa	All were great but I'm gonna go with Ralph Fiennes. Mainly because of that line in his fight with his wife:     'You're an inanimate object!!'|`|AwBVoWOaaa	I don't know.  I think Colin Farrell, he was the funniest, but Ralph Fiennes was awesome and had morals even for a soulless killer.|`|RJZQsBqbaa	Brendan Gleeson's character was definitely the most likeable.  He did show some morals (even for a hitman) by trying to help Farrell's character get away for what he knew was an accident.  But I'm gonna have to go with Farrell's character.  He was so cynical and funny.  Maybe not the nicest guy in the world, but brutally honest and hilarious.  Such a great movie, one of my favorites from '08.
0CTsNzTsaa	from a person who has ADD  i am 20 and i was only diagnosed last year because my parents don't really think anythings wrong with me. ive had symptoms for a long time but i could control it for the most part and my grades didn't really suffer til college.  if you have the symptoms you need to talk to them. tell them you can't concentrate in school.. say you try and try but your mind constantly wanders. once you mention school they should be all ears. If your grades are really getting affected by your ADD then show them your paper or something that you know your good at but are getting a bad grade. prove to them you KNOW the material but during tests and quizzes you cant concentrate enough to make a good grade.  also tell them your overly hyper. that your teachers have even suggested that you get checked for ADD or ADHD.   tell them you need to just get checked out by the doctor.   they'll get you to take a test and see if they think you do have it. tell them you want a doctors opinion because they have experience with that stuff.  tell them that even though you read up on it, it might not be true unless you get a doctor to determine it is. pretty much play on the fact that you dont know everything and need a second opinion with a Ph.D and your parents don't have that so they won't tell you that they know what they're talking about. lol|`|cvJh0g29aa	Well, first I would consider talking to them. But that couldn't work out though. Tell them you really serious about this and that you don't understand why they get mad because of it. Talking's good.    OR    Or you can like, idk, do something that'll take you to the doctor and then just blurt out that. Then the doctor will examine you.      Sorry if I wasn't much help =[  Good luck     Peace.Love.Jonas?|`|A6zBuS54aa	Call a doctor's office...secretly.  Just tell your parents to SHUT UP AND LISTEN (except in a nicer way...)|`|Amkmles0aa	i have ADHD i am 29 years old but its like a am 9 yeras old  you need to go to the dr and chat  i know what its like when you have some one that is mean  i was on meds in the fall of 1991   i was going to bed at 8:00 pm befor the meds got at 4:30 am  when i was on meds i was going to bed at 5 pm got up at 2 am  fall of 1999 i stop the meds  now i go to bed at 8 pm i get up at5 am|`|6Uohf1h1aa	call 911 .. i guess.|`|aiCsZzIsaa	Pretend to have a cold or something then talk to the doctor in private I suppose.|`|p3qrj7HDaa	This probably sounds crazy, but maybe you just have the Fire element really strong in your astrological horoscope. My sun, rising, and moon are all fire signs so I have all the manic characteristics of someone diagnosed with ADD - I just learned about my chart and my influences though and am continually working on them each day to get control of them. This is a way better route than taking prescribed speed that doesn't even really solve the source of the problem, just the behavior...with the trade off of addiction.    Try yoga. And decaf.    Most teenagers have enough of the symptoms of ADD that would qualify them to take meds for it...it's a phase for a good many people. Honestly.|`|EKT1qvyXaa	Call the doctor and explain to them (secretly)                         OR    Sit down and talk to your parents and be serious (cry if it helps lol xD)    I think I have ADHD....  anyways good luck!

sM7cLQeoaa	I haven't watched 'The Reader' yet, but this is how I rank the movies:    1.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 9/10  2. Slumdog Millionaire 9/10  3. Frost/Nixon 8.5/10  4. Milk 7.5/10  5. The Reader (because it took Wall-E/The Dark Knight's spot =[ )     I think the Academy will give the Best Picture to Slumdog Millionaire though.  It's getting alot of hype (from critics, and won a lot from award shows like the Golden Globes, and the Screen Actors Guild), so this will definitely affect the end result of the Best Picture outcome.|`|NSgSaspAaa	In my opinion, the best picture is The Dark Knight. The thing that I can't understand is that this movie is 2nd all time in U.S. history at the box office (behind Titanic)...yet it isn't even nominated for best picture...but movies like Milk and Frost/Nixon are.    The film that will win the award will probably be Slumdog Millionaire.|`|tbOCqkkZaa	i agree with you. i looooved benjamin button but i think slumdog millionaire will win. the others were good but those two were my favorite!
M4L3QY3gaa	I'm not sure how i'd react. But I'd definitely have a little fun shaming them.

I star only if they make me think. That's it.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I don't know you or anything so I don't want the first answer that I have for you to be a lie so I'm going to come clean.  Yes.  Yes I star them so that my contacts can be enriched by my knowledge.  By sending out the stars I'm assured that they have indeed learned something new.|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	lol no that hasn't happened yet|`|NLwfMSJWaa	dammit...  you caught me  :D|`|nDQOwAA3aa	not dumb answers but sometimes dumb/funny ones|`|s3Ztpnelaa	*stars question*

If you use "teacher's" (it has an apostrophe), it indicates that the next word is something that belongs to a teacher.    Here are some correct usages:    My teachers are dumbasses.    My teacher's *** is dumb.    --------------------    You may or may not be correct about your teachers' (plural AND possessive) intelligence, but yours, along with your character, is crystal clear.    -----------    Interpretation:  I just called you a stupid fool.    ---------    To answer your question, I don't have an iPod.  I'm old and hard of hearing.

Btv6dgmvaa	Love is a kind and caring passion for a person. Like you care about them and want what is best for them. For example: i love my mom, dad, siblings, and friends because i care deeply for them.    Being in love is a kind and caring passion for someone whom you have a romantic relationship with. If you are in love you would marry this person in the future. This would be like a boyfriend or girlfriend or a fiance. You would not be in love with your family members or friends  hope this helps!  (:|`|ff4fdc55e4134a54a6545ed164302405aa	I love my nieces and nephew, but I'm in love with my husband|`|jEsRU2eqaa	love is you know loving someone but when your in love it means that you wanna spend the rest of your life with them and you like you know yea kinda like what the first comment said I love my sister but im not in love with her|`|V9oCNBfQaa	Being in love is a state of Being while Love is an emotion!|`|lFPsPzxzaa	love is a feeling that no one can really describe but i love my kids, mom, family and friends and i am IN love with my fiancee who i don't think i could live without|`|5oNGEn3Kaa	Well love isnt necesarly a romantic feeling, ex., you love your grandmother, but you (hopefully) arent in love with her. you can love a certain food, your brother, or a tv show, and not be in love with it.  But as for being in love works both ways, you love the person you are in love with.|`|DzTRB0Meaa	This is more of an opinion really.....  I guess LOVE is a general term that could relate to any type of love, like erotic, maternal, and other kinds.  IN LOVE probably means loving someone erotically.|`|o10Vmrzbaa	Love is you love anythings that feel good, being in love is you have targeted a specific person to be in love.|`|E0JXlG2Raa	Being in love- is knowing that your comfortable around the person know matter what happens. Also knowing that you love that person and ONLY that person:)    Love- is liking someone almost like a crush but a little more than that.    Hope that helps::)|`|W7DhZSy3aa	to love is to love that person for who they are, your mom, your kids, your friends.... to be in love is to feel like you cant live without them and you are completley infatuated with them... but really being in love also depends on how that person loves you, i beleive... its only true love when both sides feel the same way....good luck|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Well, I love my dog. But I would never marry my dog.  You can love anything, but if you are in love with someone you can see yourself marrying them. Not like a Heyy I like you and I could see it happening.. but truly thinking that you could be together forever.  I can't see me and my dog being together forever, therefore I am not in love with him..  But.. Just because you can see it happening doesn't mean you are in love.. It just means it is a greater possibility. Your heart will make the true decision on if you are in love or not.|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	"LOVE" just means that you care deeply about a person. For example, you can love your uncle or your sister. It doesn't necessarily mean romantically.    "IN LOVE" means that you love someone romantically. Like your boyfriend or your husband.     Get it?|`|3nlyh2Vfaa	To love someone is to say that you would be anything that person needed. Whether it's a sibiling type figure, a therapist, an actual lover, or just a good shoulder to lean on.    To be in love is sort of like infatuation. You wish to be in a relationship with the person and to show them that you're the best choice for them. Everything they do is magical in your eyes and to see them fall in love with someone else that isn't you is completely devistating.|`|4M1m49vtaa	Love is just a sense of really deep caring. You can have this for anyone, family, friends etc.   There is alot of different types of loves.   In my opinion the best way to see if you love someone is to ask yourself "Would I sacrifice my life in a heartbeat, no hesitation, for this person" If the answer is honestly yes, then you love that person.  Now, being in love is just like love, also mixed with sexual feelings. A good way to test if you are in love is to add up all the time you think about yourself, and how much time you think about that person. If you think about that person more than yourself, also including the other way, you can possibly be in love.|`|wK5k435Waa	Well if you look at this from a mathematical standpoint, using the reflexive hyperdynamic theoromadic postulate computational strategic math. Sometimes described as A=B so therefore it is such that without doubt or reasonable refutation basically what im trying to say is B=A too. So Love=Sex So in love is in sex, conversley on the opposite side relativly irrelevant to the question present on page 547 of "War and Peace", However, it is completely relevant to the question on page 2 of the Iliad. In such that Love and Sex are completely related in a non relative form. Unless Sex is put first so that Sex=Love. Or if Obama is white then In Love means America is screwed. Thats all to say aboout that. Good question.|`|2DVr4C5Baa	LOVE is like loving your mom and dad and cousins and friends etc.. IN LOVE is when you love someone a lot and are attracted to them and want to have a relationship with them. hope i helped!|`|9HoXpsP6aa	In Love:   I thought saying I love you meant:  You're great, you're fun, I want to spend all my time with you... but the older I get, I realize love means understanding someone and knowing that they aren't perfect, but wanting to be with them anyways, despite their flaws.  And putting their needs before yours.  (In a loving relationship where both people do this, it can be a great relationship)    Love:  A deep feeling of caring you have for another person, this could mean your mom, dad, sister, etc... that what hurts them hurts you b/c you want them to be happy, even if it means sacrificing something you care about to make them happy.  (EX.  quiting bad behavior, even though it's hard, to make this person happy)|`|n5z1K8HCaa	I'm beginning to see that this is a pretty contreversial subject.    Love is memories. Memories that you have of spending time with any person, animal, or somtimes even an object. The more memories you have the stronger the emotion you have for that person, animal or object. This is why we love our parents and sibblings so much. Maybe someone may not love their parents as much as their aunt or grandmother because they have more memories of their aunt or grandmother than they have of their parents. You can't really compare a person to an object. Someone can love an object because it has a significant meaning. For example your younger sibling, which you love, made a drawing and gave it to you. It's not what the object is, but what it reminds you of. So there really is no such thing as "love at first sight".    When someone is in love with someone else, I think it can mean two different things. Number one basically means a crush. This would probably be where the epression "I'm in love" comes from.  A person has feelings and desires for somone else. This can involve: constantly thinking about this person, looking at the person with an infatuated look, etc. That's why we sometimes see cartoon characters with hearts for eyes when they are in love. Number two would be the act of two people loving eachother romantically. They would always think about that person and see themselves as insignificant if one did'nt have the other. This kind of love could be expressed by Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet". this may also involve sexual feelings for one onother. Being in love would only last a short while. I mean someone isn't going to be IN love with their wife/husband boyfriend/girlfriend or fionce for ever. Apart from the sexual feelings, it eventually turns into the other kind of love, just memories.    This is pretty much the way that I see it. Overall maybe love is just an illusion.|`|MuKNUlSraa	Love is the altruistic treatment of others, being in love is the emotional feeling toward others. For example, one help the poor "altruistic" out of love, but one loves "emotional" you, because he is attracted to you.|`|a8qFkmSzaa	Ok so Love is like "I love you!

20e6716e7b69edd68a6925b973be380caa	The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 British-American musical comedy film that parodies science fiction and horror films. Still in limited release 33 years after its premiere, it has the longest running theatrical release in film history.[1] It gained notoriety as a midnight movie in 1977 when audiences began participating with the film in cinemas across the United States. "Rocky Horror" is the first movie from a major film studio, such as 20th Century Fox, to be in the midnight movie market.[2] Widely known by mainstream audiences, it has a large international following and is one of the best known and most financially successful midnight movies of all time.[3] In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."|`|SlizbMMVaa	As others have stated it is a musical which was adapted for the screen back in 1975.  It has Tim Curry and Susan Surrandon and Barry Bostwick in it.  It is great fun but I would recommend you not rent it but go to a theater and watch it.  There are many places where they show it at midnight on Sat. Night.  The crowds say lines to the screen, act out scenes and just have a general nutty time.      Warning, if lotsa sex and transvestites and weirdness is not to your taste... Stay away.  But overall the experience is just too much fun.  My greatest suggestion is go to a college town and watch it!  They have the best Rocky Audiences....|`|sIAHUpMPaa	it's a movie/musical.|`|vGYhqwHaaa	its a musical/movie that turned into a pop culture phenomenon. its full of drag queens, sex and madness.|`|946a0de98c140058626f3f700cfaa468aa	It is a movie....a cult classic.  People actually hold little things in theaters where they go dressed up like the characters.  Funny!  Anyways it is a very interesting movie I liked it.|`|AA11474014	A musical that you have to watch with an open mind. Some people think it's nuts...but it really is neat.|`|c25a030b0e651dd4cba0c4cd481c6c68aa	It's a movie based on a musical called The Rocky Horror Show.  It's a tribute/spoof on the 1950s science fiction movies.    It's considered to be the best cult film ever made and is still shown in theaters across the country at midnight showings.|`|7587ddf6365878a70779095404a96207aa	The Rocky Horror PICTURE Show started out as a play titled The Rocky Horror Show written by Richard O'Brien. In 1975, it was made into a film. The film flopped. Then it hit the midnight movie circuit. People started dressing as the characters. They started yelling "call-backs" at the screen. They started throwing things such as rice, toast, confetti, hot dogs, and tortillas. Finally they started getting up and acting out the film. Rocky Horror Picture Show casts formed all over the world. A cast is a group of people get up "on stage" and act out the film while it is playing. Some casts ask that their members go to pain-staking efforts to make "screen accurate" costumes, while other casts take a few more creative liberties. It has continually evolved through the years. In 2010, the film will celebrate its 35th anniversary. The convention will be held in Los Angeles. You should come, its going to be a massive drunkin orgy...I mean party.    Many Rocky Horror casts occasionally shadowcast other films as well. Other films that have been shadowcasted include Shock Treatment (the sequal to Rocky Horror), Grease 2, Clue, Cry Baby, Phantom of Paradise, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and Little Shop Of Horrors.|`|676fffa1d033bd7fc45c4eae89d1f268aa	The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)     A newly engaged couple have a breakdown in an isolated area and must pay a call to the bizarre residence of Dr. Frank-N-Furter.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	It's a musical movie from 1975.|`|JsR4ypomaa	a musical|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	It is a movie.

X9H77A9xaa	life is unpredictable because you can't see the future and therefore don't know what's going to happen. and when life gives u lemons make lemonades, it means take advantage of the situation and make something good out of it.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	it would be too easy if it was predictable|`|cb990e4115cb75ed65875cdf816d8168aa	it just is.  nothing in life is set in stone.    and as for the lemonade one: whatever comes to you in life you just have to deal with what you got|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	Else you'll be crushed by the dozens and dozens of lemons that are thrown at you each year, you have to take things in stride to get by.|`|7aisLVeiaa	Well if it were predictable, it would be kind of boring.|`|5poK95JFaa	it means one should do the best with what they have. I love lemonade. I also like unpredictable. life is what happens when you are busy making other plans..|`|s1leABaSaa	never heard that saying but i reckon life is stupid.. you are born, you live, you get married and have kids and then you die. what else?  thats just it.|`|7IfQrwwwaa	use what life gives you to the best of your advantage, or something like that|`|OAcKN5XRaa	Because it laughs at you behind your back|`|9nymzoOXaa	because if life was predictable most people would be commiting sucide, and there would be a whole bunch of concited people knowing their gunna make it big.|`|5ed1y0uuaa	Life is built upon your mindsets. If you don't want to be bored, you will attract crazy~ness. It's not so bad! The point of that saying is for you to take the crackpot you got and still be happy.|`|WCrCEN8gaa	They say to make lemonade because they want you continue on. If everyone in the world were to give up then nothing would get done. Life can suck pretty bad sometimes but if you continue you can experience some good things too. Even if you only have a few happy moments in time its better then none. Go I guess the meaning of the saying is not to let life get you down, you have to work with what you have.|`|HQuDp6vqaa	Because you better be prepared to make the best out of any situation cuz no one promises you isss always gonna be good. ISSS UP TO YOU to make it that way!     Life is only perfect in all its imperfections!!!! :)|`|s4VzPulYaa	I think it means that when life is hard, (The lemons.) you make it as good as you can get it (The lemonade.)

Like when I was talking to my grandfather and we went from how I was doing in English class all the way to weed. But, yes you are right. She should try harder to stay on topic.|`|X9H77A9xaa	i was watching that today too. i was kind of surprised. remember when it began, there were 2 girls who stood up and said that they were boyfriendaholics. so i thought it was going to be about both of the girls. i don't like all of her shows, just some of them are interesting.|`|Gy127q6zaa	to be honest i always thought her show was stupid.

k24ulNX0aa	I met Demi Lovato at the last Burnin' Up concert tour. It was so awesome! It was really only a meet and greet, so no autographs, but our conversation went like this:    Me: Hi, Demi! My friend Ada says hi.  Demi: (Laughs) Well, hi!  (And then we took the picture and she must've noticed how frozen my sister looked because she hugged her and asked if she liked the concert)  Me: You were great tonight, Demi.  Demi: Thanks!

Edit:  "Friends with benefits? That would be nice... LOL.  No I have many female friends who are just friends."    she ment like,   one boy  one girl  being best friends..    that mostly doesn`t happen..  why? because they get closer and closer to each other by time.. until.. will, I won`t say until what, because many won`t like it.. but did you even try?  don`t tell me we`ve been best friends for 2 months or so..  tell me we`ve been best friends for years, and he, nor me, have ever thought of anything out of pure friendship.. (and I`d like to hear that from a guy.. then I`d believe that what ur calling about is sth. that can happen (pure friendship)    Edit2:  "i think they can be friends!!! I have a lot of "guy" friends"  thats another example..    but ur " "guy" friends " are just like classmates..  not like BEST friends..  not like two girls being best friends..    "I don't know what your talking about cause they really can be just friends people that don't think girl and boys cant be just friends are probably 15 and under."  so.. how old are you?  cause, no, they probably can`t..  its not that "obvious", that people over "15", can see that girls and boys can just be friends..

However, V-day is an evil, evil, evil day invented by corporate America with the intention of creating a spike in the economy once a year.  Thus creating stress for millions of people to go out and buy useless (notice I did not say meaningless) presents that really won't be fully appreciated after some time passes or when that significant other next screws up within the relationship.     With that said, when I have had someone to celebrate with I bought into it and I am sure will again one day, I am just bitter I don't have that someone and therefore must rant, making myself feel better.  *whew* I need a drink.|`|IoncQbR7aa	ill be your valentine|`|SKqkk1SMaa	I am sure that you will get a good one, and If you are the decent human with qualities that match then you deserve it as well!

I can't possibly deserve a person as good as I have and with it going on for over 14 years I feel lucky and blessed that I have somehow maintained this relationship.    I am guessing that you will be able to find yours! Just be true to your values, feelings, and desires. Remember to look more than just skin deep, because while looks (personal attraction) are important for long term relationships to work.....they are only a part of the complete package.

Just input the Anime series you are interested in, & then scroll down until you see "English" Cast.  And if the series is rather popular you might also find dubbing credits in other languages like Spanish, German, Italian, etc.  Find the character / voice you're interested in, and you'll be linked to all their works.       ----------- Example   For example the series Cowboy Bebop can be found in Japanese, English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Filipino, etc.    http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  And if you look at the voice actor for Spike Spiegel (main character of Cowboy Bebop), he's Steven Jay Blum (in the English cast).

fcEqR3yFaa	I know my lineage up to my grandparents.  As far as I can tell, my family is basically a bunch of mutts.  A little of this, a bit of that, a dash of something else thrown in to give the women big boobs and the guys small schmeckles.  No culture there, unless you count reunions at McDonald's.|`|NTYorStsaa	Yes I consider it a major influence on me and major part of my culture as well... for example I rarely eat American food mostly eat Italian , coook Italian and I cook often and I speak with my hands I am very passionate and I love Italian films and listen to Italian songs etc... Id say Im still pretty Italian.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	no  and i'm even a first generation american on my mom's side  i don't like the whole hyphen-american idea  although my italian (and slight german and sicilian heritage) are part of me i'm not tied that strongly to it  i'm too much of an american to relate to real italians    i mean, i experience my culture all the time, but its them and a little borrowed part is me  they all speak italian and english, but i speak english and poor spanish, so i know i'm different  it would not be genuine for me to claim 'italy' as a hyphen when i've never been there|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	yes|`|H9gmJYdmaa	I'm Irish and I like to drink?|`|lIQhB56Oaa	yeah.  a lot|`|mLdlFhyqaa	I believe everyone should.

In other respects my name carries Coat Of Arms from Scotland and North America history that predates the American Revolution.  Bottom line - I'm obliged to be careful who carries my line.|`|6Tw5bxXPaa	I'm not sure what nationalities I am, or else I would be!|`|Sih0xHJgaa	Yes! My dad's side is all English.

hTBZ1OA5aa	The only thing that I suggest is that you get some sort of a job and get money somehow. You can't really do much without money these days. So save up as much money as you can and then try to buy a backstage pass. Or you could even try going to a CD signing or something. Trust me, I know from experience..it is very hard to get in contact with famous ppl..but you have to think it through and put a lot of effort into it. You'll get there if you want it bad enough..|`|yBXLgHbmaa	Go to her website and she will most likely have concert times and where they are; and probably a link to buy a ticket.|`|mGQOgjeYaa	and you expect a serious answer?|`|VzJcl7WAaa	rehab|`|0x7TYAqsaa	my ***|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	lmfao.|`|mttfhpkHaa	somewhere...|`|58hfhPuNaa	At the liqour store.

It is NOT the state of being an adult.|`|OxaonF5aaa	surely no|`|ri4Y9Lmbaa	I don't think adults actually enjoy adultery, I think the damage caused and ensuing guilt that occurs due to infidelity is more hellish than enjoyable (I hope at least!)    Infants on the other hand have no other experience to compare with infancy, so it is neither enjoyable or hellish, it just is.|`|riVwJLqYaa	cute|`|Ethykzkoaa	I think many kids go through childhood wanting to be "grown up" ( not all of course) and many adults look back to their youth.

SICKO!|`|vvbhO88maa	As long as they get to play around, both are happy.|`|k9SrzQQgaa	Oh MAN you need to reword this haha. Infancy =/= adultery. No correlation at all.    If you mean to say, do children enjoy their childhood as adults enjoy their ADULTHOOD, then I'd say no.    Children, even me, take for granted how carefree and bliss their childhood is until the last minute. Adults are more mature, and they do what they can do make the best out of and enjoy their adult life with the exception of their responsibilities.|`|7xoMXSEqaa	Less so probably. Adultery feels better.|`|RAp45UmUaa	haha, i like this question. and im sure infants have no idea whats going on, so probably not|`|DuGanGcNaa	They enjoy it more in my opinion. Adults have so much responsibility and problems to deal with.

POXOqhOYaa	That's because this place is being over run with people who don't place they're questions in the right category, use bad spelling and grammar and don't make a effort to participate in the Yahoo Answers community.    Especially those people who join, ask a question or answer a question and then leave, I feel like asking why they signed up but then again it's none of my business.      But fortunately usually the top contributers and the regulars around Comics and Animation generally are all pretty nice and it's really fun to answer they're questions because they respect your answers.

89xzNpVaaa	Yeah it is, Both are two of the best albums of Metallica ever----Master of Puppets is a true metal record and even that one, i prefer " ...And Justice For All"   My favourite song of Master of Puppets is Battery  and favourite song of ...And Justice for All is Blackened|`|MwiBGBK1aa	Hmmm... Love MoP but And Justice for All is better!  Harvester of Sorrow, Blackened, AJFA|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Master Of Puppets! R.I.P Cliff     Favorite song: form MoP would be Orion.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I prefer Master of Puppets and my Favorite song is either Leper Messiah, Orion, Disposable Heroes, or Welcome Home (Sanitarium).

Oh ya RIP CLIFF BURTON (1962-1986)|`|8jSsGfUXaa	...And Justice For All is my favorite all time album.

Fave song off each-     Orion  Shortest Straw|`|L1KVUIJ6aa	master of puppets is a better album overall, and people may know that, but thanks to freakin guitar hero if people knew that One came from and justice for all, then that would probably be more popular.|`|TUxPf25vaa	master of puppets hands down  my favorite would either be damage inc or battery. im not sure

I wish i was borni so i could be alive in the sixties and seventies. The world seemed to be such a clear place then, despite the Vietnam war and middle eastern tensions. People knew what real music was, with true meaning and heart. People used to write music because it was an expression, rather than something to get rich by. I really wish my parents understood how lucky they were. Now all i'm stuck with are scratched records, my imagination and a load of love for music. :P Keep rocking.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	60's-90's not top 40.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	1980's was the birth of Metal.

Or at least I THINK it was a dream ;-) ,|`|KFtxaISsaa	Once my cat woke me up, I went to him and when I came back I fell asleep very quikly and in a short while I was dreaming. I was totally aware that I was dreaming, and so I walked among the room. I was in my English class in a dark room with two passeges and two doors. It was very dark and that upseted me. (Once I can control myself in a dream, the dream was a p.o.s.). Well, I tried to listen to the teacher but I couldn't. It was very confusing. After a while, since I was too tired, I wanted to sleep but I didn't know how to. I felt scared. Perhaps I could never do so. So I saw a light floating in the air. I approached but nothing happened. Then I had an idea. I did strength (is is said thus?) and I felt different. Then I did the same but with more effort. Ansd in some seconds I found myself like moving and lights of all colours moved back. And so I woked up, opened my eyes :)  Once again I did the same strength and opened my eyes too, although I wanted to keep sleeping, just to try it again. But I remembered too little. What a shame.|`|gbkMBA2raa	idk i was asleep|`|k8QlPisUaa	flipped the mattress over... i still don't know how.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	sleep walking and talking to random ppl, while doing it saying random stuff.|`|uEIOgxWlaa	This morning I felt numb and couldn't feel my arm and hand and started to scream a little bit.

For me, it's just a part of working on cars and motorcycles.  But maybe that's why girls love it so much, it makes them think of men.    But some other sources don't think the fact that women like the smell of gasoline (and most ment don't) is associative, they think it has something to do with brain chemistry. Also many women report craving the smell of gasoline when they are pregnant.|`|MpYIFWe7aa	LOL>..yeah me too..IDK why,,but every time my dad is going to put some gasoline...I always open the window to smell it....but honestly,,my mum thinks I'm weird...cu'z she don't like that smell....LOL|`|fnXNq30naa	I love it!!!!|`|upd7W9ZUaa	I don't love it, however I like it.

AA12004569	If I were you, I would ask your RA to find you a different room. If the RA asks why, tell the truth. Tell him/her that your suitemates are going to get you into trouble, and if they found out that you said anything they will not take kindly to it.

Why not just look for something newish at the thrift shop & get that for a lot less money.  I have a short purple nylon jacket & a below-the-knee retro aqua raincoat from the 50's, both from thrift shops & gorgeous.  When it comes to rainy days, color is everything, some basic colors & some bright so you won't get depressed.  Also, you better put some reflector tape on that jacket if you're going to wear it at night, so you won't be invisible to car drivers.<br>  <br>  I love the bamboo frame of the clear umbrella pictured.  It's very pretty, but is the bamboo strong enough in heavy wind?  Also, I notice that the rest of it biodegrades within 5 yrs, & I'm afraid it would wear out faster than most umbrellas.  Boo, hiss.  I have one umbrella that has lasted almost 30 yrs & another that I got at a lost & found auction that lasted about 10 yrs after I bought it for $2; in Dec. the handle completely separated from the top part, meaning it can no longer can be opened.  Guess it's off to the dump with that one....and so on...others lasting 10 or more yrs.  One that lasts 5 yrs or less doesn't seem like a good buy.  <br>  <br>  Best to spend some money on luggage tags for your umbrellas in case you lose them.  With practice, you can reattach the fabric to the ribs, too.|`|TApVoMdAaa	Eco friendly is a load of crap, what is so special about that jacket that makes it eco friendly?

1bkiNiwzaa	I think Scorpios cant be controlled by anyone.    But yes, the one Scorpio who I knew was always rebelling against her family.Strangely, she always rebelled about the small things, like how late she could stay out, but she gave in where the larger picture was concerned...like what eductaion she should take. I found that strange.Whereas I being a Pisces did the exact opposite.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Yes Scorpios like their own space, but they are also a bit  of a drama Queen, no matter what sign you are, unfortunately parents are parents and even though seem like they want to control your life - it is because they love you.

lbThMxj7aa	Twilight is my favorite movie, but I have to agree with you.  Rosalie was pretty, but your right she's supposed to be the most beautiful person ever!  Esme, I don't think is that pretty and Carlsie is ok.  I thought all vampires were supposed to be gorgeous.  I did think Alice was perfect for the part and I thought Charlie was fine.|`|CsmZeSUIaa	I Think reaching the status of breath taking beauty is nearly impossible. It was something that was written about her to spark imagination. Also for her to be recast now, or any of the cast at this point would the movie series. but that is just my opinion..|`|gABGRRnTaa	Thats your opinion. I personally love Carisle, he's smoking. And rosalies ok but you are right she's not that hot but no one is. And Charlie is eww. And i think Emily Browning should have been Bella. And no way should they use dakota fanning or a new jake.|`|2tFAquLVaa	i would have liked megan fox for rosalie, except she's not blonde. but other than that they did find. though i think they could have done better for edward. robert is gorgeous but not as great as some others.|`|KQRubW57aa	i rlly like the cast they did a good job.....<br>  but rlly yes rosalie and edward and all the vampires were supposed to be gorgeus but they're not gunna be perfect. wut are they gunna find a real life barbie just to play rosalie? then a real ken for edward. they did the best to find the cast and i think it was a good choice but thats just me. :D

Gp9eku54aa	Best thing you can do is take two huge breaths before you even start singing. Also, how often do you sing alone? Cause really once you start doing it more and more often, it gets so easy. I used to be soooo scared to perform in front of ANYONE, and now I do at least 5 solo performances every year, not counting the classes, practicing, etc. that I do in front of other people. It takes practice, but you also should try to think more positive. Make sure to practice a lot before a performance, then you can go in thinking about how great you are gonna do, rather than how bad you will mess up. Have confidence!|`|mMmWdfTwaa	First of all, if you feel that your voice teacher doesn't have a good opinion of you, and is intimidating, I suggest you leave and get another one.  You'll never become confident unless he gives you encouragement.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it's natural to be nervous at an audition - everybody is.  Try  concentrating more on your performance than on the CONTENT of your performance.  It takes time to perfect that approach, but you will in time.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, if you fail an audition, don't let it stop you going for others.  Remember that if you fail, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're not good enough - it could just mean that you're not quite what they want; there's a vast difference between those two things.  <br>  <br>  If you fail an audition, never be afraid to ask for feedback;  it means you will have to accept criticism, but as long as it's constructive criticism, and you're prepared to take it on board and learn from it,  you'll eventually pass an audition.<br>  <br>  Also, enter as many talent contests as you can.  If you win, it will be the biggest confidence-booster you're ever likely to get, and if you don't win, don't dwell on your failure - keep trying.  Whatever happens, never doubt your own ability, nor other people's opinions of your ability, and you will get there in the end. <br>   Good luck, and I hope I've helped in some small way.|`|XbW3ItBsaa	theres nothing you really can do about it other then just get used to it<br>  i used to shake and studder doing my speeches in front of crowds but about 12 speeches later i stopped because i started to understand that it doesnt matter what they think of me as long as i did did a good job they will think the same

NCy5Oj0jaa	Static by Everlife    It was all so crystal clear  Words like music in my ear  We had it going on  But something's wrong, something's changed  'Cause when I'm with you these days  You feel a million miles away  Connection's not so strong  What's going on, what's going on    'Cause every time I try to talk to you  I end up feeling so confused  Like you can't hear a word I'm saying  When I'm trying to get close to you  I'm having trouble getting through  I can't stand it, it's so tragic  I feel static between us    You turn your back when you take my hand  It's getting hard to understand  Is it you, is it me?  Is it time or space you need?  When you're here, you're not around  Communication breaking down  If I say goodbye to you  Will that get through, will that get through?    'Cause every time I try to talk to you  I end up feeling so confused  Like you can't hear a word I'm saying  When I'm trying to get close to you  I'm having trouble getting through  I can't stand it, it's so tragic  I feel static between us    I'm here to have it out  Tell me, why ya wigging out?  Hold it tight or let it go?  So hard to know  Hello, are you really there?  Or have you disappeared?  Oh, I can't tell  Feels like I'm talking to myself    'Cause every time I try to talk to you  I end up feeling so confused  Like you can't hear a word I'm saying  When I'm trying to get close to you  I'm having trouble getting through  I can't stand it, it's so tragic  I feel static    'Cause every time I try to talk to you  I end up feeling so confused  Like you can't hear a word I'm saying  When I'm trying to get close to you  I'm having trouble getting through  I can't stand it, it's so tragic  I feel static..|`|o0cDLbeRaa	Every time you leave by EmmyLou Harris

Here is the back story:    The song Spinning Wheels was realy written by Leola Rabb of Seattle Washington back in the early 60's- she had taken her kids to the park, where they rode the merry-go-round, on a painted pony and the spinning wheel. whe sat on a park bench watching them and writing the Lyrics back in that day songs were sold and rights given away-due to lack of knowledge. 250.00 for a song that yet makes $$$. Oh well live and learn.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Spinnin wheel      Blood sweat and tears  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Wh...

I have a best friend..  and I`d like it if we lived together.. because we have alot in common.. and we have alot to do (its like projects and so)..    but just thinking of it makes me like "ew/yuk"    so.. lucky you, you don`t have thing feeling..      edit:  "if your gut is saying that, then don't do it!  i moved in with my best friend, and well, lets just say, we literally want to kill each other now.  it ruined our friendship... and i know a few other people who are best friends anymore because they lived together.  it made me learn my lesson"  why?|`|NxNrZksXaa	listen to your instinct. i lived with one of my best friend's my freshman year, and yeah we aren't as close as we use to be. some friendships get closer, and some grow apart this way so you have to be careful with living arrangements such as this. if you still want to see how it might be then let her know that if it doesn't work out then one of you all need to move out in order to salvage the friendship. so maybe you could try it out for a semester. if you can't make it through the semester move during the designated weeks they have setup for you to request a room/roommate change.     there are many thing that can influence how that type of relationship with your friend can be broken. since you guys aren't use to living with each other full time, then you may notice some habits about her that will start to agrivate you (the same goes for her). she may meet new friends that you may not particularly like and she might invite them to the room (and vice versa). her classes may be different than yours so you're up late trying to study while she tries to sleep, or the other way around. there are many things like i said, but you guys must hold on to the things that made yall friends and keep that in mind through this experience. but trust me, you will have fun and great times with her. sorry this is so long, but i'm just making sure someone else doesn't lose a friend like i did because of living together    if you want to test it out before you actually get into it then go on a trip or stay at each other's house for about a week and see how your friend really lives and what she does/doesn't do. if you can take it, then yeah it might work. if you still don't feel good about the situation then reconsider. if you don't stay in the room, you guys can always stay on the same hall (i think that is best).  good luck and have fun!

So if you don't have that you don't have anything but an empty desire to make a movie. Honestly, you really need to ask yourself why you want to make a film. Most filmmakers have a story to tell and that drives them. You seem to be motivated by something else... But onward.    Indie films are simply films that are not attached to a major studio- though many studios have sister companies specifically for indie films, and studio execs shop festivals for good material. Your film can be of any genre, budget or length. Some festivals have requirements and restrictions, so keep that in mind. Making a film takes a lot of work, a skilled team, money, time, passion, and patience. Do you know what you're getting yourself into?

John was in Grover Washington Jr. band in the early seventy, He is in the band or on the album  Live At The Bijou 1977, that club was in Philadelphia. Mr. Blake will be in Blue Bell PA. on February 13, 2009 at Montgomery County Community College. If you have never seem John Blake you r in for a treat. his resume is like a who's who.  Duke Ellington Orchestra, McCoy Tyner Quartet, Turtle Island String Quartet, Quartet Indigo, Steve Turre Sextet, and the Billy Taylor Trio.  Years ago I saw Micheal Urbaniak with Billy Cobham great violinist. I have that James Newton album African Flower with John Blake on it.|`|5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	I haven't heard Regina Carter in a long time, but if I remember correctly, she has an avant garde approach to her playing. If you are interested in the avant garde violinists then I'm pretty sure that you will like the artist/albums that I am listing.  These are albums that I have and listen to, not a google search. My list is my opinion.    Mat Maneri's album called Blue Decco is great album. I list it first because its my favorite album on this list.    Billy Bang can be heard on William Parker's album Scrapbook. I believe that Regina Carter has a very similar sound to Billy Bang, I can't remember for sure.    Leroy Jenkins is a legend of the avant garde violin. My favorite album to hear him on is The Creative Construction Company, Volume 2. It's only available on vinyl record. A great band on that album, including Anthony Braxton and Richard Davis.   Also try Alice Coltrane's album called Universal Consciousness. Another great Alice Coltrane album.    As the above answer states, John Blake is another one to seek out. I only know him from his playing on two James Newton albums, The African Flower and a self titled album. Both of these albums are great, in my opinion, and both are only available on vinyl record, as far as I know. ONe of my favorite songs of all time is on the African Flower album. Its called Fleurette Africaine, John Blake is AMAZING on that song, and the rest of the album.|`|MoKUZuQraa	Johnny Frigo|`|iQf8Xjj5aa	The woman in the links below is a jazz violinist.

CrAwmz65aa	Nick is right in saying that Mozart didn't write "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."<br>  He did, as Nick said, write a set of variations on that same melody.<br>  This is is a problem which gets rehashed on this forum every once in a while.<br>  <br>  I understood you to ask what melodies Mozart wrote which are familiar to the general public.<br>  Here in Korea, I hear my English students spontaneously singing classical warhorses every once in a while.  I have heard them singing the first movement of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.  I have also heard them singing the Queen of the Night's aria from The Magic Flute.<br>  In the Seventies, there was a mongrelized version of the first movement of Symphony no. 40 in g minor.

ZyGyDLsDaa	It is "Happily Ever After", but I think you need more than just a title.    Happily Ever After (1993)  aka Snow White and the Realm of Doom  IMDb review:  Snow White (voiced by Irene Cara) is to be married to the Prince, but Lord Mallis (Malcom McDowell), the Evil Queen's brother, in revenge of his beloved sister's death, kidnaps the prince. Snow White flees to the Dwarfs' Cottage only to find that the Seven Dwarfelles, their cousins, live there now. When they are about to have their natural powers stripped away by Mother Nature (Phyllis Diller), Lord Mallis attacks them while they are on a quest to save the prince. Will the creature lurking in the shadows be able to help them?   Also in the voice cast are Edward Asner, Carol Channing, Dom DeLuise, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Jonathan Harris, Sally Kellerman, Tracey Ullman and Frank Welker.    I think that YouTube might have part if not all of the film:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCLV0__2r...

RSLLR0Z4aa	Sorry but Akira Toriyama shows no sign of bringing the show back, but i believe they will continue with the anime movies. They have a very new one from a Japan convention in like September 2008. Its called "Dragon Ball: Yo! The Return of Son Goku and Friends!!", its only in Japanese though and i believe you can find it on Myspace video, check it out.<br>  <br>  & yeah ima humongous DBZ fan but the new DBZ movie looks to be a complete disappointment to me, i think its gonna turn out like Dead or Alive (which was absolutely terrible)....what they should have done was make it like Beowulf, it may not a been extremely real lifelike, but i guarantee it would have done better then what the neww DBZ movie will do.|`|QUpzCltZaa	Dragon Ball :<br>  <a href="http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/3824.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/3824.html</a>|`|wdxUb3moaa	Yah I know they won't bring it back...<br>  <br>  And the movie looks terrible... as but I am probably still going to watch it to confirm that! I am going to expect the worse :(|`|wJSYXvzGaa	Nope that was it. the others are right about the movie though that is the new thing. its based on the dragon ball series with piccolo being evil. its going to suck since its not even close to looking like the anime.|`|SY2dabbzaa	no sorry but they made a new dragon ball z movie its called the return of son goku and friends <br>  <br>  yeah its after majin buu saga also they are making a dragon ball z live action movie|`|VILBKcZMaa	They just made a movie that was based on after the Majin Buu saga, and now they was just making a movie of Dragonball Z for this year for 2009.|`|DPcIjHHZaa	their making a movie about it that all of what i heard here the trailer:<a href="http://www.reelzchannel.com/movie/243366/dragonball-evolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.reelzchannel.com/movie/243366...</a>|`|d7ezpKqSaa	you guys gotta be kidding me.. do you all really didn't hear that DBZ is going to be rereleased in HD wide screen.. with the latest computer animation tech?? it is going to be 100+ episode.. no fillers.. it is true and it is going to start airing in japan april 5 2009 and it is called dragon ball kai<br>  <br>  here is the link: <a href="http://comicbookmovie.com/fansites/sgarandomcomicstuff/news/?a=6207" rel="nofollow">http://comicbookmovie.com/fansites/sgara...</a><br>  <br>  and the official site: <a href="http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/dragon_kai/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/dragon_kai...</a>|`|24BDyLKOaa	No more episodes and the movie does look gay.<br>  <br>  I enjoyed DB and DBZ way more than DBGT. Akira had nothing to do with DBGT maybe thats why it sucked. But yeah, it sucks that its done, but i think they shouldnt make more cause it might somehow ruin the whole series then.

And apparently Leah isn't going to be written into New Moon at all, so Vanessa Hudgens won't be playing her for New Moon.

bd448e1f3bd718257d99b496aea00800aa	Both are comedies:    The Dinner Game (1998)    Bit of a fool Francois ruins new friend Pierres life during the course of one evening.   Mixing up messages to Pierres wife and to Pierres mistress, accidently inviting Pierres former best friend (now enemy) to visit Pierre and accidently causing Pierres to be audited for tax evasion; things go from bad to worst all due to Francois who is only trying to help.    The Closet (2001)    Nebbish, Francois Pignon (note: same name as the fool in the Dinner Game but not the same character or the same actor) is about to be fired.  To prevent that he spreads a rumor about himself that hes gay (hes not).  Fearing a discrimination lawsuit his company refuses to fire him.  But now Francois has suddenly become the companys gay representative.  Funniest scene:  straight but shy Francois wearing a condom hat and riding the companys safe sex float in a gay pride parade.|`|r4rr5sL3aa	you can pick bon cop bad cop it's a french and english movie and its funny|`|SPOuVDE0aa	Amelie  Paris, Je t'aime |`|768111555ea193cbaa27a5b9ff4a2dbcaa	Amelie|`|3wOJQQqnaa	Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain!  Amelie is about a girl living in paris. She has a really sheltered childhood and basically lives in her own little world. She becomes determined to help the people around her find happiness and as completes her little missions she begins to pursue this really cute, quirky guy and starts to fall in love.   Its a really great movie and its really well-known, so you could probably find a script or a monologue on the net somewhere.  Good Luck!|`|qIjstjsVaa	I don't know if these are 'common' but two of my favorites are Amelie and Angela.|`|LID8Gm1Aaa	Amelie was a pretty popular French film.   Cyrano de Bergerac I remember watching that one in French class.  Paris, je t'aime has been getting good reviews as well.    I'm sure you'll be able to find something.      I'd look for anything with Grard Depardieu or Audrey Tautou
AA10159262	Wow, what a great question. Personally, I'm surprised to see that anybody remembers the grand old days of the bloodthirsty Spectre. and the Beyonder too, no less! I really get into these cosmic guys.     It's clear that Beyonder is more powerful than the Living Tribunal, since B is the sum total of all that there is in his universe (I won't dignify the retcon) and the LT is not the sum total of all there in in his universe.     However, I would have to give the LT points on experience, since right up until the end of Secret Wars II (an ending which was directly taken from the Roger Zelazny short story 'For a Breath I Tarry', by the way) the Beyonder showed none of the classic wisdom and insight and restraint one would expect of a cosmically powerful guy.     Indeed, the hallmark of all those uberpowerful ones is that they rarely interact with us microscopic peons but just sit back and let events take their course unless they have no choice left but to react. You see this in guys like Odin, Eternity, the Watchers and the Star Trek Prime Directive of noninterference (trying to pat ourselves on the back and make ourselves think that we're big boys now and that we've learned how to do it right.) As Stanslaus Lem wrote in one of his stories, "Omnipotence is best displayed when it does nothing!"    (Yes, Galactus is the exception, but he doesn't interact personally anymore, he's regarded as just sort of like a force of nature.)    But I digress. To get back to your questions, I'll take the Spectre over Doc Manhattan every time. Not that I don't like the separated-at-birth-from-Aladdin's-genie physicist, but here's the thing: Spectre is supernatural and has actual supernatural powers; Doctor Mahattan is not and does not. In that respect, I think the Marvel character closest to Dr. M., is, ironically, Owen Reese, the Molecule Man (who got his powers as a 'radiation accident' ultimately attributable to the Beyonder)    For example, Doctor Manhattan is speed-of-light-limited. Spectre is not. He is able to do things that just plain defy the laws of physics.     As proof, tachyons (moving facter than light) were able to confuse Doc M. but Spectre was able to travel through different dimensions, grow larger than a galaxy, smother explosions with his cloak, question murder victims as to the manner of their demise (!), paralyze foes, pass through walls, transmute matter, read minds, create light, cause time to stand still, look into the imediate past, and even grab a passing comet by the tail and swing it around his head to use as a club!     (Note also that in growing larger than a galaxy, Spectre shows himself more powerful than LIbra in his first appearance vs the JLA in which he went nuts after trying to absorb half the Milky Way. And probably more powerful than him in his more recent appearances, too.)    For Darkseid vs. Thanos, I am not sure. I lean toward Darkseid, but that's just because I don't like Thanos! Warlock...? Maybe... Maybe.     I won't deny my bias in favor of the Spectre. I like Doctor Manhattan and I'm really looking forward to the Watchmen movie.     Remember in Secret Wars I when Doc Doom got the Beyonder's pwoer and made Owen Reese realize that his powers were even greater than he had allowed himself to believe...? ("I can affect organic molecules after all! I can!!) That's the kind of level I see Doc Manhattan on. But they are purely physical pwoers, not supernatural.     I'm well aware of the late great Arthur Clarke's dictum, "A sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" but you have to show that it IS technology, not inherent ability contrary to the ordinary behavior of matter and energy, or it probably is magic.    Things like global entropy reversal and global causality violation are and will probably always remain supernatural, despite the fact that some fine S/F stories have been wirtten about them    Anyhow, I have to go. Really liked your question. Give me an email if you want and we can talk some more.|`|j4yVOhvIaa	Nope Doc Manhattan owns and will continue to own especially after the movie comes out...DC comics also owns..yeah..short sweet and simple

L1qQBNbbaa	Indians always seem to criticize films about India when they are not made by Indian Directors,they did the same thing with Gandhi and Passage to India, they need to look pass the fact the movie is set in their poverty ,we all know in the West that India is a vital, modern world,but come on there is poverty and we are not going to judge their whole country on a film set in their slums.  They need to see this film for what it is, a story of triumph and everlasting love,it's the best film in years and they should just enjoy it like the rest of the world has.|`|NrOuDXW4aa	A large part of the reason is that there is a vocal section of the indian population who do not like to see Indian depicted to the world as a poverty striken third world country.  In fact a large part of the Indian population do live in squalid conditions but this isn't a view of the country that they want presented to the world.

JdIabzQaaa	I thought the first one was REALLY good, then the second was pretty good, the third was stretched a bit, and the fourth was AWFUL. The whole series was REALLY stretched out, and there were so many things that were unnecessary. But over all, the first three are good, I'd give them a 4/5 and with the fourth one, its a 3/5.

PZ3myuoUaa	Yo,  I recommend the DigiTech Metal Master.  Digitech is the probably the best guitar effects/pedal maker.  I myself own this as part of an effects pedal.  I also hear that the electro-harmonix metal muff is good.  You should try youtube-ing distortion pedal demos.    P.S. Yes, these pedals can range from light distortion ("overdrive") to heavy distortion ("distortion").|`|AA10124897	I've always liked electro harmonix...  Boss makes a couple good ones as well... I guess it depends on your price range.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Overdrive or distortion? Ppl are suggesting distortion pedals, but if you're looking for an overdrive pedal, then the ones that I've seen are:    Voodoo Sparkledrive, Ibanez Tubescreamer, Boss SD-1 / OD-1 / OD-2, and Digitech Bad Monkey.    The second is the overdrive classic, the first is like the TS but voiced more modernly. The rest are decent, but EQ'd a little differently - darker, more or less gain, etc.    If you're talking an actual distortion box instead of a booster pedal... well, that's kind of a different topic. I would need to know more to give you a decent suggestion there....        Saul

Once they arrive in town, it's Hell on Earth. The kids soon get demonically possessed after listening to too much metal. The band's vocalist, Damian, is the main culprit for all of the chaos that follows, including someone being eaten by speakers!  // Cast includes Carmine Appice!  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094752/    The Dungeonmaster (1985)   IMDb synopsis:  Paul, a computer whiz who spends more time with his machine than with his girlfriend, finds that he has been chosen as a worthy opponent for Mestema, and evil wizard who has spent centuries searching for a challenging foe. After having his computer changed into wristband weapon, Paul does battle with a variety of monsters before finally coming face to face with the ultimate adversary. // This is notable for the squence featuring Blackie Lawless and fellow W.A.S.P. band members.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089060/    Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare (1987)  aka Edge of Hell  At an old farmhouse, a family mysteriously dissapears at the hands of evil. Years later, hair metal band The Tritons comes to the farmhouse, whose barn now features a 24-track recording studio. Lead singer John Triton (Jon Mikl Thor) gets the band to perform their first night in the farmhouse after dinner, and weird little beasties suddenly appear. Band members and their tagalong girlfriends begin to act strangely and vanish one by one. Soon, only Triton remains, and he holds a secret to a battle between Heaven and Hell.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093873/    Trick or Treat (1986)  IMDb synopsis:  Hard rock idol Sammi Curr (Tony Fields) burns to death in a hotel fire.

After a heated discussion about the deceased rock star, Nuke presents Eddie with a rare demo record, the last ever recorded by Sammi and the only copy in existence. Overwhelmed by Nuke's generosity, Eddie accepts the gift without hesitation, unaware of it's dark role in things to come. // Ozzy Osbourne makes a surprising cameo.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092112/    Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal (2001)   IMDb synopsis:  Heavy metal singer Slade Craven is scheduled to perform his farewell concert on a Boeing 747, TransCon Airlines flight 619, which will be flying from Los Angeles to Toronto, and the concert is scheduled to be broadcast over the Internet.

eoQoCcz5aa	Not sure about Hip Hop but there's a band called  "Kings of Leon ", you may have already heard of them but they are they are a good band , they're massive in the UK had one of the biggest selling albums in Blighty last year won a Brit award aswell . They are from USA but can't believe they are not as big in their own country hopefully that will change . They're just one of those bands that are quality will be around for a long time .<br>                       Kindest regards , cheerio .|`|4JQUUrX1aa	wolf parade<br>  handsome furs<br>  okkervil river<br>  new pornographers/neko case<br>  of montreal<br>  decemberists<br>  elbow<br>  glasvegas<br>  arcade fire<br>  ra ra riot<br>  matt & kim<br>  grizzly bear/department of eagles<br>  fleet foxes<br>  kaiser chiefs<br>  blitzen trapper<br>  animal collective<br>  deerhoof<br>  deerhunter<br>  my morning jacket<br>  the national<br>  peter bjorn and john<br>  destroyer<br>  franz ferdinand<br>  interpol<br>  spoon<br>  sunset rubdown<br>  frog eyes/blackout beach<br>  tapes n tapes<br>  the week that was<br>  architecture in helsinki<br>  andrew bird<br>  pinback<br>  midlake<br>  tv on the radio<br>  mates of state<br>  swan lake<br>  m ward<br>  dirty projectors<br>  black kids<br>  mgmt (almost forgot) :)|`|7p9OeSD8aa	Paramore- alt rock band<br>  <br>  Fall out boy- alt rock  baand<br>  <br>  Nirvana-alt rock band<br>  <br>  my chemical romance-not really alt rock but they r amazzing<br>  <br>  Rihanna-hip hop<br>  <br>  let it rock-by kevin rudolf|`|7qt4aQGYaa	Korn, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine, Hollywood Undead|`|82f28216acfea170ebefb0b7a25198d7aa	Check out PERMANENT ABILITY<br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/permanentability" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/permanentability</a>|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	Del Tha Funkee Homosapien & Leaders of the New School.|`|9fn9dXnHaa	i dunno if it falls under these categories, but i love 3oh3 and the killers and the fray.

jA1ukKSHaa	Well I Don't think your good but your not Bad. <br>  In my opinion you mumble a little and I can't <br>  really understand some of it because it was a<br>  little slurred together. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is take some singing lessons <br>  and you could probably be really good. they<br>  will let you know what your doing wrong and<br>  fix it with you.

63ff1e2e36a5822cdda3d11750463689aa	aquarius' are usually very popular because they are unique and stand out from the rest....they are usually very accepting of others and love humanity. they are outgoing, as they LOVE social situations, however, they need to spend time along to reflect and recharge..<br>  <br>  aquarius FTW|`|Yt3dLSJUaa	I find popularity very annoying.I want nothing to do with it,somehow though,nobody seems to accept that.I would be sitting alone at lunch(in my usual spot that I have always sat since freshman year) and read my book-than-*pop**pop**pop**pop* they start descending upon me and even though I try to ignore them,its damn near impossible....so ya,you could say that I attract people like bears to Honey...and I hate it.|`|4e911a1a92f0524d87554578ea0e7544aa	The Aquarians I know are sought out by others for their skills and leadership.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I am sure some are. <br>  Some aren't.<br>  I have known a lot of popular Leos, though|`|dsBCGbWpaa	Nope, not all of us are popular. But all of us are well-liked. I've noticed that there are two types of aquarius. There are the really normal and popular aquarius who act like everyone else to be in the cool crowd at school who love to party, then there are the very unique freespirited aquariuses who do things much differently than everyone else and challenge society's norm who are intellectual and sometimes very quiet. I'm an aquarius and I don't have any friends at my school. I sit alone at lunch, but I'm ok with it. <br>  <br>  I think maybe the ascendant has something to do with the two different types of aquarius or maybe it has to do with the January aquarius' and the February aquarius'. I've noticed the January aquarius' and early February aquarius' to be much more intellectual than those born later in February. Maybe it's just me? Best of luck!|`|sIJ6jxNdaa	not all are popular but i think most of them are even when they are trying to not be popular like me in my school i don′t know how but almost everybody knows me and my friend is not so popular she is a virgo and sometimes when she is not here i am with nobody and i talk to guys that are not at all popular i really don′t understand so my conclusion is that aquarius are popular even if they try not to be popular some maybe don′t know they are and think that they will never be popular that happened to one of my friends now she is one of the most popular at her school|`|hzAidxdkaa	yes.. all aquarius' are popular and rich. There are no exceptions because horoscopes are 100% accurate and everyone born in the same month is exactly alike.|`|bvTNTzCwaa	they can be most of the time they attract unsual people|`|k9gp11PMaa	Stereotype|`|IRiSE0qlaa	I wouldn't say that. My ex is aquarius and he isn't popular. In fact he's kind of introverted but doesn't mind talking to strangers either. Looking back now, he's VERY introverted, almost always traveling, taking pictures (he's a photgrapher) or at home on his computer..he'd go out clubbing once in a while but quite rarely. I guess he's the quiet, eccentric, free spirited type of aquarius.

Why do men online fall for FAT Women?This has happened to a lot of my male friends. They "meet" women online who refuse to meet them in real life. All of these relationships start in the same way and end in the similar ways with VERY similar stories. These women always flirt with them online, chat with them over messenger, start talking on the phone, end up having phone sex, and they normally wait until after the guy has purchased a plane ticket to make up some ridiculous story about why they can't meet them. AND these men fall for it everytime. It takes the men like at least 3-6 months to even start questioning these fake net hos. What's the deal? And why do these women always end up being the exact opposite of who they described to these men? They end up being FAT, UGLY, JOBLESS, LAZY, etc. And some of these women use tactics of holding the camera at a higher tilted angle to make them appear smaller.     BEWARE MEN! If you "meet" someone via internet and they are here 24/7 then they probably aren't as "HOT" as you think!      Well, NO ONE has anything to say on this subject? You have to be kidding me...come on, I know you people know someone this has happened to. I alone know at least 5 guys. I even have a friend in his 20's who met someone he thought was 21 and she ended up being 46!!! I know someone who thought he was going to meet a skinny caucasian woman and she ended up being a morbid obese african-american. Share your stories here!      And what are these women thinking? Do they think they are meeting men who are going to magically forget every lie they have ever told him? "Maybe if I smile he won't notice I am 25 years older than I told him I am." OR how about "Maybe he won't notice I am a different skin color than I described!"    Are these women delusional? More importantly, are these men stupid? Is it these easy to fool them? I want to know.     Why can't women just be who they are. People will love and accept you for who you are not what you look like.      Men, want to know if she is telling you lies? Tell her you've purchased a plane ticket for her or you which ever and that you will see her this weekend. See how fast the excuses start rolling. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

6komlMwRaa	Well, Crystal Innocence is when you somehow put an equip type innocence into your body. This makes you innocence behave like a parasite type innocence, at a cost. Your innocence uses you blood to make the weapon. You can see Leenalee in the anime towards the end of the series(episode 101 onwards). In the anime, she is the only one to use this.<br>  Hope this helps.

E7i4J7e7aa	common cuz ***** aint scared of **** told the west coast ice cube aint **** right in their backyard hard *****|`|7qczKTv3aa	I'd go with Jay on this one primarily because Common hasn't been as consistent. Lyrically they are on par with one another, but Jay has the better flow. Common still dropped the best song between them: I Used to Love H.E.R.<br>  <br>  NaS tops them both though.|`|KoNHUcNUaa	Common|`|jvX36ryyaa	jay-z because he could be lyrical like common but he also made real hot catchy songs more so than common could do.  commons are always deep, but thats the only way his songs are really good.  his other stuff is just fun and creative, but not really all together impressive.  jay-z on the other hand can rhyme with great lyrics being very creative with words like common, but he can also make it hot and hard so the streets will like it. that was his whole thing, he can rhyme like common but he makes it hot so he can make more money because in the end of hte day thats his job.  he explains it better than me<br>  <br>  The music business hate me<br>  Cause the industry ain't make me<br>  Hustlers and boosters embrace me<br>  And the music i be makin<br>  I dumb down for my audience<br>  And double my dollars<br>  They criticize me for it<br>  Yet they all yell "Holla"<br>  If skills sold<br>  Truth be told<br>  I'd probably be<br>  Lyricly<br>  Talib Kweli<br>  Truthfully<br>  I wanna rhyme like Common Sense<br>  (But i did five Mil)<br>  I ain't been rhymin like Common since<br>  When your sense got that much in common<br>  And you been hustlin since<br>  Your inception<br>  **** perception<br>  Go with what makes sense<br>  Since<br>  I know what i'm up against<br>  We as rappers must decide what's most impor-tant<br>  And i can't help the poor if i'm one of them<br>  So i got rich and gave back<br>  To me that's the win, win<br>  The next time you see the homie and his rims spin<br>  Just know my mind is workin just like them<br>  (The rims that is)|`|iEGSjQCKaa	Common by far ........................<br>  <br>  Common has skills<br>  <br>  Jay Z just steals shyt ...............|`|3oUSroiZaa	Jay-Z|`|8v40KEd0aa	Of course, Jay-Z!|`|rp6EEjECaa	Hov is definitely more popular and I will admit that he's good but after "Reasonable Doubt" and "The Blueprint" he just dropped off. Common is real, maybe not as well known or popular but he is real. Half the time the alternative less-known rapper is better than the more popular mainstream one (take the Nas and Jay-Z beef for example). Don't get me wrong, I like Jay-Z but I think that he's a bit overhyped plus he's a swagger jacker who steals Big's rhymes and flow. Maybe if Jay got off Big's d*ck then he would be better.|`|hsJ2s69vaa	Common is my favorite rapper his lyrics are great and his style is very chill...<br>  <br>  but jay-z is a legend..you cant really choose|`|yoVF60ORaa	i think i'll go with common sense, and pick common sense<br>  <br>  <br>  hov is still a legend though|`|RcNAzealaa	I'd say Common.

Este tema me gusta mucho y da a entender que todo es un ciclo en la vida que se repite una y otra vez.     Nos dice que la decepcin y lo predecible siempre est ah, pero nosotros nos hacemos de la vista ciega y seguimos en la va esperando un mejor desenlace pero todo siempre termina igual.    Por ejemplo:   "Ayer Julieta denunciaba a Romeo por malos tratos en el juzgado, cuando se acuestan la razn y el deseo llueve sobre mojado."    El amor puro, perfecto, eterno... termina en separacin. Ya lo sabes desde un comienzo pero igual te lanzas a l. El deseo cundo ests enamorado prevalece encima de la razn y termina en algn momento volcndose la situacin, por eso llueve sobre mojado, es ms de lo mismo pero no importa en el momento.|`|fc2e4f348d7d749fc40e16b9a974d4f7aa	ya lo dijieron, pero de todas maneras la cancion es buenisima.    saludos, viva fito fito fito|`|9622a2f3fe95b98ca18c3df3ea1f9c92aa	A m me gusta lo que canta,aunque como a vos hay cosas que me cuesta entenderlas.Besitos.|`|ac14902eadc964655edd6e5ac5263922aa	Yo entiendo que se refiere a sobre ca.gado mas ca,ga,do!!!|`|b7c19aa3b975c6135da39c2ce5ddebc0aa	es muy buena|`|a6ba8975d783b9b988c03c21842b7c71aa	yo entiendo como q las cosas se repiten, o sea, si estas lastimada por un enga?o y buscas otro amor, ese te enga?a otra ves o algo asi, no se como explicarte.

Are they male or female?  If male, usually the key of A major(the a below middle c, or A3). If female, i have found that a good key for them to sing in is D major or E major.  Resonation and phonation also can play a big part in their range.  Make sure they are using correct mouth shapes with minimum space between the upper and lower teeth, unless singing high notes, then of course they need to open more.  You can usually find young childrens voice books at music stores like marshall music, meyer music, etc. You might be able to find some at Barnes and Noble as well. Good Luck!

6fAtTEKBaa	----------------------------------------...    Jimenez suspended for song parody     --------------------------------------...    By DAVID HINCKLEY  DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER    Friday, May 4th 2007, 4:00 AM              --------------------------------------...    Print Email Suggest a Story      Luis Jimenez    --------------------------------------...    Luis Jimenez, the popular and edgy Hispanic morning-radio host whose show is on hiatus in New York City for a year while he changes stations, has been suspended by his new employer over some of his on-air content.     Jimenez's show, which is expected to return to New York next January on Univision's WCAA (105.9 FM), is currently heard in cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas.     A statement from the company yesterday said, "Univision Radio has suspended Luis Jimenez for inappropriate comments made during a recent broadcast of his early-morning program.     "While Univision Radio encourages innovative and fresh programming ideas, it takes seriously its responsibility to provide information and entertainment that adheres to the highest standards."     Reports on the New York Radio Message Board and elsewhere said the offending item was a song parody involving lesbians. Univision provided no further details on the length of the suspension.     Jimenez had the No.1 morning show in the city at WSKQ (97.9 FM) when he left in December to sign with rival Univision.     That signing raised some eyebrows because Univision is a conservative company and Jimenez has always pushed the envelope. He said earlier this year that Univision "understands who it hired and what I do."     He also noted he was never sanctioned by the FCC. "We don't use explicit language," he said.     "We make up our own words."  losiento pero no lo en contre en espanol pero creo lo sacaron por que iso una cancion de lesbianas y se ofendieron

5671adb7c90fee3c432eb1af934ef8c4aa	johnny cash.    To explain:  The star has 5 points, square has 4, and the triangle has 3. Starting with the triangle count every 3 letters and keep going to the square and then to the star. However, count every 4 for the square and 5 for the star. You will then get "artist know as blamanck". Which means "man in black". (the word "man" is in the middle of "black") The celebrity know as the man in black is Johnny Cash.    Good Luck! :)|`|5c0ec5be12238b3707fa4acccd4f8d3faa	look at the shapes.  You count off the letters according to the shape. ie. star - take every 5th letter. square every 4th, tri - every 3rd.

zbqlUuBcaa	First question: do you wanna be able to see what's going on outside the booth?  If so you'll need that Plexiglas, if not the plywood egg crate would do.<br>  <br>  Couple of things you need to know:  Do you want to cut out sound in the room you're playing/recording or you want it to be more quiet for the neighbours? If you wanna control in room sound it'll work, if you wanna mute it down it won't.  The sound inside a room is pretty much reflective sound, so fairly easily controllable with just panels (or plywood and egg crate in our case).<br>  <br>  But the sound transferring from one room to another is what's called structural noise and that my friend is a whole other beast to deal with!  Because structural noise can't really be heard but is more "felt" than anything else - think of a booming Honda Civic at a red light.  You don't really hear what's going on in the car, but you can definitely feel it!  The only thing that will attenuate this is adding mass to the walls, and in the end comes MUCH more expensive.<br>  <br>  In any cases a plywood/egg crate combo will cut down some of it but be carefull not to invest too much money in something that "won't quite" do the job you're looking to do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Math.|`|S4IvjacEaa	I was going to suggest the plywood/egg crate thing.<br>  That would work well use a pretty high density foam though.<br>  If you havn't been to foambymail.com you need to, their stuff is cheap and I think the shipping is free.

AA11942173	There are numerous reasons that are valid from a narrative point of view for killing a beloved character.  Some of these include motivating another character to take action (e.g. Uncle Ben or Sue Dibney), showing that character sacrificing himself/herself for the good of others (e.g. the XMen 3 movie version of Jean Grey), emphasizing how dangerous a villain or threat is (e.g. Doomsday killing Superman), or making a very important point (e.g. Captain America getting killed makes a variety of metaphorical and literal points, including that the current direction of registered superheroes is a dangerous one).  None of these really fit the situation of killing off Aunt May.  (You could make an argument that killing Aunt May helps make the point that the registered, unmasked hero deal is dangerous, but that's redundant with the death of Captain America, so it would be frivilous.)  Therefore, I think that Marvel won't have her die.  They just want to add to the drama by hospitalizing her.|`|e4353542228be082d8905600b494182daa	She will probably live, but she and MJ became targets as soon as Peter unmasked.  What he needs to do is have Spiderman get a picture, on TV, with Peter.    Impossible?  No, ask anyone with an image inducer (remember those from the old X-Men issues?) to become Peter , then have Spider save him .. and when Peter get's hospitalized, just take his place.
