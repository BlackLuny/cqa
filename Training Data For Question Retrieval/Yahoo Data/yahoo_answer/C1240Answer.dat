zYQFpJWNaa	Crap Face is correct. along with the 'shape' of the orbitals, are the energy states of the electrons within the atoms.    But there is something more that can be said that is, in a way, quite interesting.     In the current way of seeing subatomic particles, if you have two atoms of the same element, and both are in the same energy state, we consider them absolutely identical. We accept as fundamental that we could not tell the difference between one electron and another, or one proton and another. and in the same way, we assume that these two atoms would be absolutely identical. No oxygen atoms are named James or Henry, or even Flash.    When you consider that in the real world, where we have objects, we know that they are never ever 100% identical. But in the quantum world we say that we are 100% certain that they ARE identical.|`|92517655f5cdc0b04061c39c885a5811aa	-Number of protons  -number of neutrons  -number of electrons  -shapes of electron orbitals    The above differences result in various unique chemical and physical properties of various elements and compounds, from the reactivity of sodium to the ability of water to form hydrogen bonds.

But the gamma rays produced during the Hydrogen fusion had an energy of a few *million* eV.    The conclusion must be, that the gamma on it's way out was absorbed and re-emitted a few thousand times each time losing and redistribution energy.
Ogvtgl8daa	I think you mean "what if the earth did not change it's axis angles?"      You are correct, without the change in angles, the temperatures would be more "level", without seasons.  The equator would still be the hottest point, cooling as you go North or South toward the poles.
NIb8zWEHaa	Biogenesis: is the idea that life is only begotten from other life forms. You can't have a rock suddenly melt into becoming a mole. The Biogenesis theory is the predominant one nowadays, and dates from about the middle of the 1800s.    Spontaneous generation: was an older theory. The idea was that maggots just appeared spontaneously in meat, aphids formed out of dew on plants, contagious diseases could just manifest without actually catching them from somebody else. Life could form out of unalive things.    Overwhelmingly nowadays, science believes in biogenesis. All living things originate in other living things. There is just one hitch... how did life start originally on our planet, billions of years ago? The most common theory is that somehow almost organic molecules were shaped and stewed in rockpools on early Earth, eventually interacting in chemical ways which made them into a version of DNA, and eventually the self-replicating nature of these chemical reactions produced the earliest life forms.    And some would say, that story of the organic stew sounds a lot like a case of spontaneous generation.
b1a356a171cfdc067007281982717464aa	You put one dot for every electron around the atom's outer electron shell.      So, first you need to know how many electrons fit into each of the electron shells around the atom.    Hydrogen would have one dot, carbon would have 4 (because it has two in the inner shell), oxygen would have 6 (again, two in the inner shell), Neon would have 8, aluminum would have 3.    Anyway, as far as WHERE to put them - they get spread around the four sides of the atom.  If an atom has 4 (like carbon), then one dot on each of the four sides is OK.  If it has 5, then it'll have 2, 1, 1, and 1.|`|tV9LqeYcaa	The dots are the number of valence electrons the element has. On the peridodic table all elements in Group 1A have 1 electron (1 dot), Group 2A has 2 electrons (2 dots), Group 3A (after transition metals) have 3 electrons (3 dots), Group 4A has 4 electrons (4 dots), Group 5A has 5 electrons (5 dots), Group 6A has 6 electrons (6 dots), Group 7A has 7 electrons (7 dots), and Group 8A has 8 electrons (8 dots). The transition metals in the middle of the periodic table vary depending on the element they are attached to.|`|3OlUzzumaa	You have to put one dot for every electron around the atom's outer electron shell|`|TS5swHMvaa	Those dots represent valence electrons, or the number of electrons in the outer shell of the atom.  A full valence shell will have 8 electrons, with the exception of Hydrogen, which has only one.  The number depends on the element, for example, the noble gases all have full valence shells (8 electrons), so are normally nonreactive, the column to the left, starting with Fluorine, has 7, then the next column has 6, and so on until Boron.  Put 2 dots on top, 2 on each side, and 2 on the bottom for a full valence shell.
iBditO5Kaa	28. There are 5 wavelengths over a distance of 30 cm. A wavelength is defined as the distance from the peak of one wave to the peak of the next, or from the point where amplitude is zero but increasing to the next instance of this. In this case, the wave is a simple sine function, with 5 waves over 30 cm. So, 30/5 = 6 cm per wave, or a wavelength of 6 cm.    33. D. The outer core is made of liquid iron / nickel, and the reason that P waves change direction is due to a change in density between the mantle and the core material. S waves aren't repelled by the core, rather they naturally change direction as they travel through the mantle.    36. D. Although Mercury is closer to the Sun, you'd still need to heat your ship on the way there. There is very little material in space to cause friction with the ship (unlike in earth's atmosphere), so you wouldn't need to keep the rockets burning the whole way.    37. C. Scientists are currently unable to send probes to planets outside our solar system, as even the closest star is several light years away (that is, travelling at the speed of light for however many light years away an object is would take x years) and we can only travel at a fraction of the speed of light. So, they rely on light itself to bring us information about other planets, using radio telescopes. It is equally impossible to detect changes in a planet's atmosphere from that far away, considering how astronomically tiny they are, so scientists rely on finding and interpreting patterns in the electromagnetic radiation.    39. B. A black hole is a collapsed neutron star whose gravity is so dense that past its "event horizon" nothing can escape, not even light (light is what we call the visible spectrum of EMR, it also includes gamma, x-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, microwave, and radio waves).    40. This one's a little tricky, as i'd tend to say background microwave radiation is more explicative of an expansion theory (which is implicit in the Big Bang theory) and distant stars that give off only red light are more indicative of a gravitational redshift effect, but I guess of the two Abby's would be the more directly related statement (Sophie's is related more to the expansion of the universe rather than its beginnings) so I'd probably agree with you and say A.
Gnfc4wRlaa	You are getting all worked up over another hoax.  The Earth isn't going to be destroyed in 2012 and it wasn't destroyed before.  Maybe you are thinking of the asteroid impact 65 million years ago that is credited with the destruction of the dinosaurs.  Another one will occur someday, but if it were going to happen in 2012, it would be visible now.    Nothing is going to happen in 2012 any more than any other year.  I have watched the 2012 Doomsday program on the Hysteria Channel.  If you pay attention and listen carefully, you will hear all the "weasel words" like "may be", "could", etc.  The entire program was done that way. Their "experts" didn't actually say that anything was going to happen. They didn't give any actual Bible verses to support their theory, and all the Nostradamus "quotes" weren't what he actually wrote. They were what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted. He never mentioned 2012.  Watching this program just confirmed what I already knew, that the whole 2012 hype is a silly scare tactic being promulgated to sell books.  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years.   It is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  They didnt predict the end of the world, it was only the end of that cycle.  The current recycling of the fictional Planet X is for it to hit Earth in 2012. It is supposed to be a giant planet in the outer Solar System. Please note that Planet X was predicted to encounter Earth in 2003 (after it was predicted for 2000). In reality, Planet X does not exist. After 2012 is past and the hype dies down, I'm sure this tired old horse will be flogged back to life for a new doomsday prediction. After all, they do need to sell their books.    Zecharia Sitchin (who wrote the book about Nibiru) is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar.   Galactic Alignment  There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.  Asteroid Apophis - the 2001 alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.  Polar Shift - the magnetic poles are moving all the time.  Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we cant predict when they will occur again.    Passage through a "photon belt" has been added. This is also untrue and wouldn't hurt us if it were. Photons are merely units of light.  Solar flares happen all the time and we have more of them at some times than others. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	1.

Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.    1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012."     (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.

A hoax is a lie that is being told by people who know that it is a lie.  Some do it just for the purpose of scaring you.  Some do it to try and get money from you (they sell books on "how to survive" or they sell space in survival bunkers)  Some do it for even more devious means (they try to get you to join them or they want to play with your mind).    Most of the lies about 2012 come from the same people who had predicted the end-of-the-world for... 2003.  That is when they invented Planet X that was to come close to us and cause all kinds of problems.    Do you remember dying in 2003?  Me neither.  There was no end of the world.  That's because Planet X does not exist (and they know that as well as I do).    What they hope is that you will be sufficiently scared to give them money (for the book for survival equipment or for other services).    The marketing around the 2012 end-of-the-world is much better than what they had for 2003 (a lot more people talk about 2012 than they did about 2003).    But it is still fake.    Personally, I plan to eat turkey, with stuffing (I use a Dutch recipe with mashed potatoes, bread, onions and celery), cranberry sauce, homemade gravy and mashed pepper squash (it is surprisingly sweet, especially with butter).
rsTB7D1zaa	Light mass board, let's ignore it.    You have 3.6m, and we are told the rock is placed at the center.  So we can assume that 1.8m away on each end is one of these two boys.      Clearly, the side of the seesaw with the 50kg board is already down.  Then the third boy must place himself somewhere on the side of the seesaw with the 35kg boy.    The principle that applies here is torque.  For the board to balance, we require that the torque be 0.  So, the formula for torque is T = r x F (formally a cross product, but here r x F = rF because of the fact the board is flat).      Since all the forces present are weights, I will neglect the gravitational constant, g, which must be formally applied to these equations.  (It should be T = rmg, but since g appears in every equation, I will focus on making the sum of r*m go to 0).    On one side, you have a 50kg boy at 1.8m, this produces a torque of 90 Nm [*g].  On the other side, we already have a 35kg boy at 1.8m, producing 63 Nm [*g].  This oppose the 50kg boy, however, so we have a net torque in the system of 27 Nm [*g] which the 25kg boy must oppose in order to balance the board.  Then the 25kg boy needs to place himself at 27/25 m away from the center on the side of the board with the 35kg boy.  This would be 1.08m.

52414242fe3ad4a32e2f2dfe56e02f62aa	In addition to the above answers, radiometric dating techniques (eg, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, K-Ar, Rb-Sr etc) are based on the amount of the parent radioisotope locked in a mineral when crystallization took place. When molten igneous material cools and hardens, the atoms of the parent radioisotope are no longer free to move about the igneous body and the "clock" is set.  As a true sedimentary rock does not have a history of minerals crystallizing from an igneous melt, it is not possible to provide a radiometric date of sedimentary rocks.    The exceptions are volcanic ash beds in a conformable sedimentary sequence and volcanic dikes cutting sedimentary strata can be used to provide "older than" and younger than" absolute dates.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	Radiometric dating works because when minerals crystallize, a portion of them (always in regular amounts) forms in radioactive isotopes. Igneous and metamorphic rocks form by crystallization. Few sedimentary rocks are formed by crystallization, instead they are cemented together.     As the other poster mentioned sometimes volcanic rocks are interlayered between sedimentary layers, but those aren't sedimentary, however, they can be dated, and those volcanic rocks can be used to give a good estimate of the age of sedimentary rocks   Also dating Igneous intrusions can also be used to give a good estimate of the age of some sedimentary rocks|`|De4vgWXPaa	It isn't, as it happens.  Sometimes, sedimentary rock contains material that can be dated.  Volcanic ash is a common enough example.|`|rrYsgJ20aa	Most sedimentary rocks (with the exception of ash beds) contain remnants of other rocks formed at various times.    For example, a random conglomerate picked up from anywhere may contain plutonic fragments formed millions of years ago, some clays formed 100 years ago, and volcanic or metamorphics from somewhere upstream that formed thousands of years ago.    Using radiometric dating on this rock may be able to give you the age of any constituent - but it will not tell you how long ago these were all deposited together and solidified into a sedimentary rock.    However, an ash bed can be radiometrically dated because the ash "forms" at a given moment, and will become a sedimentary rock shortly after.  At the time of formation it would have a fixed ratio of parent to daughter isotopes, and you can figure out the age based on the amount of decay from that point forward.|`|7959WbC2aa	Because they are undergoing changes constantly through chemical and mechanical weathering. Because of these changes (alteration), the isotopes are not pure but have reformed and it becomes very difficult to sort out which isotopes are from the formation of the rock and which isotopes come from alteration.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Most sedimentary rocks are composed of pieces and parts of other rocks.  You could date them, but you would be dating the original formation of those rocks from which the pieces and parts (sediments) came from, not the time when the deposition of the sedimentary rock occurred.    IMHO...I do not consider ash beds to be sedimentary, but rather igneous...

Y07zLuaKaa	Chlorofluorocarbons- A family of inert, nontoxic, and easily liquefied chemicals used in refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, or as solvents and aerosol propellants.   They were developed in the 1930's in parallel with the rise of the refrigeration industry. The operation of a refrigerator requires a working fluid which at ordinary temperatures is a gas, but which can easily be changed to a liquid by applying a moderate pressure.   These substances are very unreactive chemically; thus they do not degrade inside the fridge, they are not flammable, and if there is a leak, they do not poison the homeowner. They appeared to be ideal, and over the years, new uses were discovered for them, including propellants for aerosols (what pushes the hairspray out of the can), and as blowing agents for plastic foams (the little bubbles in the hamburger container).     Ozone  is present only in small quantities, is the principal absorber of harmful ultraviolet rays from the Sun. In the natural order of things, the level of ozone is in balance. Ozone is constantly being formed when ordinary oxygen absorbs, and constantly being converted back to oxygen when it itself absorbs.   CFCs upset this balance because they survive in the lower atmosphere without chemical change. Over many years, they gradually migrate to the upper atmosphere. Here they themselves can absorb light of very short wavelengths, less than 250 nm. This radiation is only present in the upper atmosphere. Upon absorption of light, the CFC molecule splits off a chlorine atom fragment. \h\   It is this chlorine fragment that is the cause of the problem, and not the CFC molecule itself. This is because chlorine atoms act as a catalyst for ozone destruction. One chlorine atom is able to destroy tens of thousands of ozone molecules. The problem is especially pernicious because CFC molecules stay around such a long time in the atmosphere, some of them 20-100 years. Therefore CFC's released today will be damaging the environment of our children and grandchildren.   It is not true to say that CFC's (or more properly the chlorine atoms that are formed from them) will destroy the ozone layer. Ozone is continually being formed and destroyed, quite naturally, but the level will undoubtedly drop. Less ozone in turn will mean that life on Earth gets less protection from those harmful ultraviolet rays from the Sun.|`|wm4gi8keaa	Cl? --> Cl? + Cl?

Even if the Sun is in the sky at the same time, we will see it. The Moon circles the Earth every 28 days. While the Earth rotates once every 24 hours. The result is that the Moon seems to change position in the sky by 1/28 of a full rotation every day. During that cycle, the Sun and Moon will be in the daytime sky at least half the time. Sometimes we don't notice the Moon because it is only a small wedge or the clouds hide it.   By the way, Venus is also visible during daylight hours during some of it's rotation, but it is a very tiny pinpoint of light and is very hard to locate even if it is bright.|`|aQ7uHHgEaa	The moons revolution path around the earth is not like ours around the sun.

iw1IFxhBaa	Sarcoptergygians (lobe finned fishes) are bony fish with fleshy-, lobed-paired fins, which are joined to the body by a single bone [1]. These fins evolved into legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates, amphibians. They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). The braincase of sarcoptergygians primitively has a hinge line, but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish. Many early sarcopts have a symmetrical tail.    The ray-finned fishes are so called because they possess lepidotrichia or "fin rays", their fins being webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ("rays"), as opposed to the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class Sarcopterygii. These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton.    I hope that helps... so sorry if it doesn't...

Using basic algebra k comes out to be about .012. <br>  <br>  Now, you will take the k value found about and insert into into the integrated rate law, with the time elapsed in converted to sec...it should resemble the following<br>  .0742=AOe^-.012*162<br>  Solving for AO (initial concentration of A)= .5247 mol/L<br>  <br>  So you ask...is this correct. Well there is always a way to check your answers. On a basic level 57.4 sec half-life and 2.7 min elapsed looks to be almost 3 half-lives. If you know this conceptually you can check yourself on a test. Every half-life takes one-half of the original concentration...1/2 three times equals 1/8. So the answer should be a little under 8 times the concentration, and it is since the third half life would be .5936 mol/L. Finally if this isn't clear cut close to one side of the other go inbetween the two half-lives so you have a range that your math could come in.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

This enzyme's active site is specific enough to ensure that the correct amino acid pairs with the correct tRNA. The amino acid binds to the tRNA at the 3' end of the tRNA strand. The amino acid bonds there through ATP phosphorylation.<br>  <br>  In laymen's terms, an enzyme attaches the appropriate amino acid to the appropriate tRNA, and then this as a whole is carried to the ribosome via a protein network.

As quantity increases to a certain point, there are diminishing marginal returns. <br>  <br>  Elasticity of demand: Demand is inelastic when, no matter the price, the same amount will be used.  My teacher used insulin as an example.  Within reason, no matter the price, patients will continue to buy the same amount because it is essential for them to live.  Demand of chicken, on the other hand is more elastic.  Elastic demand means that chicken is price-sensitive.  <br>  <br>  Substitutes: Included in the reasoning that demand for chicken is elastic is the fact that there are many substitutes in the market.  Think about all the other things a person could eat instead to get the same rough amount of nutritional value.  Turkey, beef, tofu, eggs...<br>  <br>  Price: Price impacts demand, as mentioned above, in that as the price gets too high, consumers will demand less.<br>  <br>  Demand curves are written with price on the vertical axis, quantity demanded on the horizontal axis.  <br>  <br>  Start in the upper left (high price, low quantity) and draw a downward sloping line ending in the lower right (when price is low, there will be an increased quantity demanded).<br>  <br>  As others have mentioned, without more information, this is only a rough estimate.  However, I think for the level of economics you're studying, it will be more than sufficient, especially with the reasoning given above.<br>  <br>  <br>  The additional information about  there being more than 10 shops just means that the shops do not have a monopoly or oligopoly (which would give them the option to set prices at an unsubstantiatedly high level)|`|O3XPdFUmaa	dude, we need more info.  please give more info, so we can help!
6v5YJB1qaa	the Kp for the reverse of a reaction is the inverse (one over) the Kp for the forward reaction. <br>  this is because the Kp expression (or any equilibrium constant expression for that matter) for the forward reaction is the concentrations/partial pressures of the reactants over the concentrations/partial pressures of the products<br>  eg. Kp=(Press N2)^2 *(Press H2)^3 <br>  .               (Press NH3)^2<br>  for the reverse reaction, the Kp expression is flipped, so your products now are your reactants and your reactants are your products.<br>  in this case N2(g)+3H2(g) = 2NH3(g) becomes 2NH3(g)= N2(g)+3H2(g) for the reverse reaction.<br>  Therefore, to figure out Kp of a forward, take the inverse of the Kp of the reverse. to figure out the Kp of a reverse, take the inverse of the forward (inverse meaning just raise it to the negative one power).<br>  <br>  the second part is simple. if Kc is less than 1, that means that in the equilibrium constant expression there are more reactants than products (refer to the expression i wrote earlier). If it is greater than 1, it means there are more products than reactants. if you still don't get it, play with the numbers. write out an expression, plug in numbers for concentrations, and see what you get.<br>  I'm in AP chem too. interesting class.

I didn't do as well as I should have, and got a 3.74 GPA for the semester.  Time was not the issue, though.  I just didn't do enough over the weekends.<br>  <br>  To pull it off you must be very performance oriented.  Approach every test and major assigment as if your life depended on it, and get a head start on your studying.  I'd suggest giving yourself two weeks to prepare for a test just for the purpose of making sure you nail it.  If you don't have any tests in the near future, make sure you get your projects out of the way so that you will have time to nail the tests when they do come along.<br>  <br>  That's just my personal perspective though.  As I said, I have failed to do this and I may not be the best person to ask.

OXsRXLx1aa	It doesn't really relate is the thing though. <br>  <br>  Some things an egg-drop machine uses to protect the egg:<br>  Vibration Absorption/Control: Rubber bands, styrofoam, bouncy things... these all absorb impact energy and direct it away from giving a large shock to the egg.<br>  Mechanical Deformation: You might have had straws on the bottom that collapsed and broke on impact. This is how a car protects you in an accident and absorbs the energy to break apart rather than send it to the egg.<br>  Air resistance: The only thing that is similar to the astronaut's Pod (or Shuttle) is the use of air resistance to slow it down. If you used any sort of parachutes you increased the surface area of your egg-drop machine. The space shuttle enters the atmosphere so fast it doesn't need a parachute, instead it just coasts down to the ground using air resistance to slow it's descent.<br>  <br>  The shuttle lands like a normal plane... and the space pods that dropped relied on successive parachutes to slow their descent until they landed in the relatively soft ocean. The shuttles all have a carbon-ceramic bottom to protect from the intense heat caused by reentry, something your egg drop machine lacks (I hope! Otherwise hello scrambled eggs!). <br>  <br>  Anyways, enough of this...hope it helped a bit

PkGROcYqaa	In my opinion, both education and culture are problems.<br>  I feel the reason why people do not accept evolution is because they don't understand the theory completely.<br>  For example, I have seen and heard the following question many times:<br>  "If evolution is true, then why are there still monkies?"<br>  This question (seen on yahoo answers at least once every 2 days or so and I hear it from friends multiple times) poses a deep misunderstanding of evolution.<br>  Based on this quesiton, people feel that evolution occurs on a fast time scale (ie 30-50 years.). Or people will want to see evolution with their own eyes.<br>  I blame the education system for this misunderstanding. If you compare our education system (especially science) with european countries, you will see that the science education is much better in european countries than US.<br>  <br>  The next major problem is culture. Religion still governs science research and scientific decisions. For example, stem cell research. That research has slowed down because of religious conflicts.<br>  The US culture believes that the human race is unique and that we were made special. I think that they cannot understand/believe that we came from previous ancestors. If we did come a previous ancestor (in their eyes), then that defeats the idea of a God. They believe that their God made each one special/unique.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	It goes back to our roots really.  America was started by religious fundamentalists who found the Church of England to lax.  Puritanical zeal is a big part of what made the US the great nation it is today.  But it obviously has its down-sides.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, the US isn't really run by fundamentalists (it's run by corporations who, by and large, do a pretty good job).  The republican party throws them a bone every now and then, but thankfully they don't really run the party (and even that party doesn't run anything at the moment).<br>  <br>  Ultimately the persistence of creationism comes down to demagogues who tell people what they want to hear and validate their hopes and desires.  The same mechanism that keeps the Pat Robertsons and Jerry Fallwells of the world afloat is really the same thing that keeps Al Sharpton or Jeremiah Wright or even the ruling clerics in Iran or Adolph Hitler going--pandering to your demographic by putting your authority behind what they want to believe, and then using their support to bolster your authority.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Is that percentage real?

AA11847539	No, not true that extroverts don't do well in engineering profession.<br>  <br>  What is the time span of your experience? Or of the other answerers?<br>  <br>  My experience is based upon 40 years of engineering and project management (dealing with both technical and human issues).<br>  <br>  In the long term, your technical skills will not be sufficient to achieve the success you desire. Use your extrovert personality to your best advantage - the fact that a lot of us fellow engineers are typically introverted can be to your advantage. We lack what you have. You are fortunate.<br>  <br>  In any field you will have to sell yourself and your ideas. If you are an introvert you have an advantage.<br>  <br>  Two main keys to success (career and personal) are ATTITUDE and ENTHUSIASM. And some technical skill.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Bill|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	You may be the square peg, but it is not because you are an extrovert.  It never hurt me that I am a bit more of an extrovert than a lot of engineers.  What is true is that engineering tends to be interesting to introverts who like to focus on a process.  But the experimenters etc. are extroverted to a large degree.  I was able to move between jobs because I could communicate effectively with people who might hire me.  I also ended up in government in a position where I was talking a lot about processes the needed to be done and to convince people of how things should and would work.  So being an extrovert is not a hindrance at all but works well in certain situations.  Look into yourself to determine what works well with people you are dealing with and what doesn't work.  Do you try to tell them what they are doing wrong?  How about being the office know it all?  There are things which turn off people you work with if you find that they don't respond well to you.  It is an organization with an office full of people who may not respond well to you.  If you want to succeed in that organization you need to become a good working part of it rather than some one who rubs people the wrong way.  Maybe a change of scenery will work better for you.|`|m8tm3enpaa	yes bcuz there is I0ts 0f taIking and c0mmunicati0n|`|tBwdVpG4aa	You are right that it may not be received well in some environments.  Most engineers fall on a spectrum from mildly introverted to strongly introverted, with a tail out into Asperger Syndrome.<br>  <br>  That's because engineering is mainly highly focused detail work on technical rather than interpersonal subjects.<br>  <br>  However effective engineering managers range from mildly introverted to strongly extroverted, and there are various non-management jobs within the engineering profession that definitely benefit from an extroverted personality.  For instance, sales engineers, engineering reps and project managers.  These are people who need to understand the engineering, but work largely with people.|`|ifBmd8lYaa	I think many of the tasks related to engineering do require focus on machines and processes rather than people.  However, many engineers bridge the knowledge and problem solving skills into more “people-related” jobs.  Just because you are not directly dealing with the guts of physical objects or the nitty gritty of a system it doesn’t mean you can’t apply science and technology to working with people more.  Many great leaders in technology were once engineers or trained as engineers.  There are sales engineers as well as engineering managers and executives.  As a matter of fact many of these high-tech company CEO’s hold PH.D.s rather than MBAs, because I guess certain people relate jobs still require a deep understanding of the products.

R9KvEhMxaa	Well, the advantage of them is that they're easy to use, and they give reliable, simple dosing. One of the most overwhelming concerns when dealing when designing a medication is making it easy to take. A perfect medication that someone has to take six times a day just isn't going to fly. A patch, you stick on, and forget about until you have to change it. These can be daily, weekly, or sometimes longer.<br>  <br>  The disadvantage to them largely lies in the design and manufacture. These concerns are fairly irrelevant to the patient, except that in some cases the cost gets passed on. The other thing is that some people have mild allergic reactions, or just plain irritation due to the glue in them. Reservoir based patches are occasionally susceptible to 'dose dumping', where the bladder in the patch that contains the drug splits and dumps the dose all at once, however, I can't think of a single reservoir based patch offhand.

I don't remember exactly what year, but anytime after the 80s, pennies were all copper plated rather than solid copper, so they actually work for this... anyway.).

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Well, yes.  A photon's energy is proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength.<br>  <br>  Like any bound particle, a photon in a box will have quantized energy levels.<br>  <br>  @Ivan--just because you can explain something classically doesn't mean it can't also be explained by quantum mechanics.  This is especially true in optics.  Ultimately the proca equation that governs the quantum field theory of spin-1 objects is pretty much Maxwell's equation.<br>  <br>  ---My point is that just because you can describe something classically doesn't mean you can't describe it quantum mechanically.  In this case, the allowed modes for a bound photon can be understood with quantum mechanics just as easily as it can with classical E&M.  And photon-in-a-box isn't fundamentally different than electron-in-a-box except that you use the Proca equation instead of the Dirac equation.  You get discrete energy levels because, not coincidentally, the math reduces very quickly to Maxwell's equations.|`|uOqk7PzGaa	There are quantized or allowed electromagnetic modes for photons however these modes are not a quantum effect and have nothing to do with the fact that electromagnetic energy is quantized into photons. These modes are similar to those exhibited by electrons, but they are by no means the same in nature.<br>  <br>  Electromagnetic modes can be perfectly well described with classical electrodynamics without having to use quantum theory.<br>  <br>  @bekki: you missed me? l think you made my point, Maxwell Equations are 100% classical, not quantum mechanical. EM modes can explain energy levels for photons but those modes are obtained classically (no need for QM to find the modes). There is an important difference between photons and a particle in a box. Photons cannot jump up and down in their "energy levels" the way particles do. Higher energy levels have to be filled by an already existing photon at the right energy. That is a fundamental difference between particles in boxes and photons in boxes, they do not behave the same way. Analogies between photons and particles in boxes have to be taken with a grain of salt.

zf8BnU6Yaa	Using algebra and trigonometry will work.  Using trigonometry you can read those angles.  Then you look at the right triangles and reason in this manner.  If A is the height of the total tower and flag pole, I then know that the tower is 20 feet lower.  Now the tangent of an angle is the opposite side, the tower in one case, divided by the distance from the tower to the surveying instrument.   So with the same distance to the tower, the adjacent side, you know that the adjacent side is the same for both measurements.  And you know that the adjacent side times the tangent of the angle is equal to the opposite side so that the difference between the two heights will be equal to one factor minus the other.  Then you write: Adjacent side times the tangent of the angle to the top of the flag for one side of the equation and the adjacent side times the tangent of the angle to the top of the tower plus 20 feet for the other side.  From there you should be able to find the distance from the surveying instrument to the flag pole, and then the height of the flag pole.|`|8cbdSe0Saa	tan69.6=y/x        y = height of tower<br>  <br>  tan 70.9 =(y+20)/x<br>  <br>  <br>  two equations two unknowns do it

We need to find the Greatest Common Factor of 48 and 60, the biggest number that they are both evenly divisible by, in this case, it's 12. Then take 48 and 60 and divide them by 12 to get 4 and 5 respectively.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	If an atom has multiple electrons, the electrons experience not only an electrostatic attraction to the nucleus, but also an electrostatic repulsion from one another.<br>  <br>  You can estimate the effect of other electrons by modeling them as spherically symmetric charge distributions.  The electrostatic field of a spherical shell is zero if you are inside the shell.  So what this means is that if an electron is close to the nucleus, it is not shielded by the electrons outside of it.  It will see almost all the nuclear charge and be very tightly bound.  If it is further away from the nucleus than all its companions, it will be very well shielded.  It will see a low effective nuclear charge and be loosely bound.<br>  <br>  So what this means is that if you have only a few valence electrons, they will be very loosely bound.  If you have more valence electrons, they will be more tightly bound.  In fact, the atom may be able to grab more if there are available spots at that energy level.<br>  <br>  Noble gases are stable because they have many valence electrons, so the electrons in the atom are tightly bound, AND no room to add any more without jumping to a higher energy level.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	its outermost energy level is full of electrons

OBq36Nynaa	When you look at a picture of galaxies 13 billion light years away, you are seeing the universe and those galaxies 13 billion years ago.  Light has to travel to us from those galaxies for us to see them.  The light from those pictures left those galaxies 13 billion years ago and traveled the universe for 13 billion years and reached the telescope that took the picture at the moment the picture was taken. <br>  <br>  A telescope is a time machine when looking into space as light has to spend time travelling to us for us to see.  So when you look at those pictures, you are actually looking back in time and seeing how those galaxies looked 13 billion years ago.  If you want to see how those galaxies look today, you have to wait billions of years for the light that is leaving those galaxies today to travel the universe to you.  <br>  <br>  Those galaxies 13 billion light years away that you see today are probably 26 billion light years away today because the universe has been expanding for 13 billion years since those pictures we see today left those galaxies.  In other words the light leaving those galaxies today will take around 26 billion years to travel the universe to reach us.  Again we will see them how they looked billions of years ago.<br>  <br>  If you took off and reached those galaxies in one second, you would find those galaxies are no longer there but are billions of light years further away.  Of course that would be impossible because light is the fastest thing in the universe and it travels at 186,000 miles a second or 6 trillion miles a year and it took that light 13 billion years to reach us.<br>  If you want the miliage to those galaxies, multiply 13,000,000,000 x 6.000,000,000,000 (13 billion light years x 6 trillion miles for each light year)       Look up.|`|tBwdVpG4aa	If you could fly to the Andromeda galaxy, which is close, it would look about the same when you get there.

Otherwise implantation of radio-pharmaceuticals. <br>  <br>  This is a complex subject. A patient urologist needs to take time to explain the options your dad has.

It doesn't matter what you want, or the rest of your family want. If he chooses a radical prostatectomy and the rest of the family says he should get a biopsy first then that does not matter, you should all be supportive of his decision.|`|2f7214f6ad7889e2dcde8b7609919286aa	I am with Troy.

I would go with the biopsy first just to see what exactly is going on. It does not take long and the results are almost immediate, then you would know for sure what your up against. The risk of surgery alone, must be considered his age infection anesthesia etc. Really anesthesia at any age is a risk.  My dad died of bone cancer that spread everywhere in a matter of weeks. The worst part about all of it was everybody telling everybody else what should be done.  Respect your dad and please pray on it the answer will come I promise.

A radical prostatectomy is BIG surgery, and can have some permanent after effects that he may not want.

He may very well end up with a prostatectomy, but it makes sense to know exactly what you're dealing with first.

ossCVxPqaa	The work required to lift the rock  = m*g*h = 7*9.8*6 = 411.6J<br>  <br>  Your question seems to be confusing a number of physics principles:<br>  Think of the following:<br>   1) before the rock is lifted, it is stationary on the ground. Due to the force of gravity, it exerts a weight force of 7*9.8 = 68.6N downwards on the ground.<br>  2) Newton's third law tells us that the ground exerts an equal magnitude but opposite direction force on the rock, that is 68.6N upwards. <br>  3)The forces are in equilibrium, and the rock is stationary.<br>  4) Now you wish to lift the rock. How do you do this? You must apply an upward force on the rock. The two original forces are no longer in equilibrium , there is a  resultant or net force acting upwards.<br>  5) because of this resultant force, the rock begins to acelerate upwards.<br>  Once the rock is moving it is necessary to apply only a force equivalent to m*g to maintain a constant velocity upwards. For the rock, this is the previously calculated 68.6N, and because you are moving it over a distance (height) of 6m, you get the work done , which is force * distance = 68.6*6 = 411.6N.<br>  6) the rock will have gained 411.6J of potential energy in being lifted up.<br>  7) If you continued to apply a resultant force on the rock wile lifting it, so that the rock accelerated upwards, and did not travel with constant velocity, the time taken would have been reduced. The work done would remain at 411.6J , but because the time is reduced, the power applied must be higher in this case.|`|X9BAbTQbaa	I am sure that to move any mass requires a force to be applied to the mass and so there must be acceleration of some sort.

Pull homework questions from each chapter and try to write your own questions based on all or a few of the concepts.<br>  I would also suggest finding a method that works for you for solving all types of physics problems.<br>  My method involves drawing a picture and a force diagram for every problem.  I then write an equation for all of the forces in the y-direction and one in the x-direction.  I also make a list of all the variables that are given, the ones I need to know to solve the problem, and star the ones that are the answers.<br>  For instance I might know the mass and velocity but I'll need to find the time in order to get the acceleration or something like that.  <br>  Then I figure out which equations I will use and write them down before I plug any numbers it.<br>  This also helps you score points in most classes, even if you don't get the right answer.|`|hhPRCdpLaa	too bad, some people are just meant to master other subjects.

Also, the atomic mass you read on the periodic chart is the average atomic mass of all the isotopes of that element in their natural abundance.  Natural hydrogen contains 0.015% deuterium which drives the mass up a bit.|`|ossCVxPqaa	If you take a "standard" hydrogen atom, it has 1 proton and 1 electron. This atom will have a mass of exactly 1.00000 amu because it is exactly 1/12th the mass of the carbon 12 atom.<br>  However, hydrogen has another atomic structure, called an isotope, which consists of 1 proton, 1 electron and 1 neutron. This is heavy hydrogen or deuterium. This occurs naturally in a sample of hydrogen. There is a third atom having 1 proton, 1 electron and 2 neutrons, called tritium. <br>   If you then take an average sample of hydrogen, and determine its atomic mass you will not get exactly 1.0000, but you will get a higher figure which takes into account the extra mass of the isotopes, which are present in a very small propotion compared to hydrogen. This average mass works out at 1.0079 amu compared to 12.000 for carbon 12. You will also note that carbon is not 12.000, but 12.011 amu for exactly the same reason - there are more massive carbon isotopes present.<br>  <br>  This is not the reult of any fractions of protons, neutrons etc.|`|WKUv05hpaa	because thats the average atomic mass of various isotopes.

On each pass only about 15% conversion occurs, but any unreacted gases are recycled, so that eventually an overall conversion of 98% can be achieved.<br>  <br>  The steam reforming, shift conversion, carbon dioxide removal, and methanation steps each operate at absolute pressures of about 2.5–3.5 MPa (25–35 bar), and the ammonia synthesis loop operates at absolute pressures ranging from 6–18 MPa (60–180 bar), depending upon which proprietary design is used.|`|fbcc08ab14324fa71f4ec63edcac9921aa	Ammonia synthesis gas production having a shift reaction stage employing a copper-based catalyst wherein the air supplied to the process is passed through an absorber that removes sulfur and/or halide contaminants, is described.

AA11370645	Say you have an atom of Sodium (Na), which is a metal, and Chlorine (Cl), which is a nonmetal. Na has 11 protons and electrons, and Cl has 17 of each. Electrons in an atom occupy various "shells." These shells can hold a certain amount of electrons. For these two elements, the shells can hold the following amount of electrons:<br>  <br>  1st shell: 2<br>  2nd shell: 8<br>  3rd shell: 8<br>  <br>  Atoms want to have their outermost shell filled. By doing simple math, it can be concluded that Na has 1 electron in its outermost (3rd) shell, and Cl has 7. It is easier for Na to lose an electron to fill all of its shells instead of gaining 7. Conversely, it is easier for Cl to gain an electron than lose 7. Cl essentially "takes" an electron from Na. Upon doing this, both atoms have a full outermost shell and are happy. However, when Na loses its electron, it becomes an ion with a positive charge (as it has more protons than electrons). When Cl gains an electron, it becomes a negative ion (as it has more electrons than protons). Since opposite charges attract, the two atoms are attracted to each other, forming an ionic bond. This forms NaCl (commonly known as table salt).|`|9z5YJKqLaa	well, ionic substances are formed when an atom that loses electrons relatively easily reacts with an atom that has a high affinity for electrons.

The metal gives away to reduce themselves to a stable configuration (8 valence electrons) while the non-metal receives it to raise itself to stability.<br>  <br>  They don't share electrons like in covalent bonds because either atom has a strong pull against the other and therefore, cannot share.
k5Ece8BTaa	No.<br>  <br>  This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage? <br>  <br>  ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.<br>  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.<br>  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.<br>  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.<br>  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes. <br>  ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.<br>  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.<br>  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.<br>  <br>  Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice Dec. 21, 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

The Mayans studied our sun and made their prophecies based on the cycles of the sun. <br>  <br>  Based on their observations, the Mayans predicted that from the initial date of the start of their civilization, 3113 B.C., one cycle being completed would be 5,125 years in their future, Dec. 21, 2012. The sun, having received a powerful ray of synchronizing light from the center of the galaxy, would change its polarity which would produce a great cosmic event that would propel human kind to be ready to cross into a new era, "The Golden Age."<br>  <br>  A second sign is the increase of natural disasters leading up to the date.  Natural disasters have devastated the earth throughout history, and in recent years we have seen just about everything -- hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, earthquakes and floods.<br>  <br>  One prediction that the U.S. is headed for five natural disasters has some believing in the doomsday theory.<br>  <br>  Another factor is that many of the world’s religions and most famous prophets reference something cataclysmic happening around Dec. 21, 2012.  The medieval predictions of Merlin, the Book of Revelation and the Chinese oracle of the I Ching all point to this specific date as the end of civilization.<br>  <br>  Also, one of the best known Catholic prophets, Irishman Maelmhaedhoc O'Morgair, better known as St. Malachy, predicts that the Pope after John Paul II would be the last.<br>  <br>  Then there are those who believe in the famous predictions of Nostradamus.  Those studying the Prophecies of Nostradamus say that he has indicated the possibility of a Third World War.  <br>  <br>  It is believed that a major terrorist attack on the U.S., assassination of some world leaders and another war in the Middle East may precede the Third World War, as well as numerous natural disasters. Sounds a lot like the world we live in today.<br>  <br>  There is also this tie in to modern-day technology.  The Web Bot Project, developed in the late 1990s to assist in making stock market predictions using a system of spiders to crawl the Internet and search for keywords, much like a search engine does, also came up with the same date.<br>  <br>  Skeptics point to a long history of "Failed Doomsdays," but many oracles of doom throughout history have a disturbingly accurate track record.|`|gf5sJAWUaa	Jerk off onto a dog and the dog will tell you the answer

But since you have the term (x^-5), your derivatives will have the powers of -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12, et cetera.  Which means that you can take an infinite number of derivatives, and never get zero.
YHNK9UrQaa	Chimp shmimp.  Meiosis is basically the same no matter which animal (or plant) it is happening in.<br>  <br>  Body cells are diploid.  That means that body cells each contain two sets of chromosomes. <br>  <br>  Gametes (i.e., sperm and eggs) are haploid. That means that gametes each contain just one set of chromosomes.  Two haploid gametes combine to form a fertilized egg which is a diploid.<br>  <br>  Meiosis is called a “reduction division” because it is the process by which the number of chromosomes in a diploid body cell is reduced by half to form haploid gametes.<br>  <br>  Meiosis is also important because it is the place where “independent assortment” and “crossing over” occur.   “Independent assortment” and “crossing over” are what facilitate genetic variability.  Otherwise, all chimps (or whatever animal you are discussing) would be identical.  Genetic variability is the whole point behind sexual reproduction (aside from the fun parts, that is).<br>  <br>  Meiosis has two steps: Meiosis I and Meiosis II. <br>  Meiosis I has Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I & Telophase I.<br>  Meiosis II has Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II & Telophase II.<br>  There are scads of web sites that you explore to learn the details about what exactly happens at each phase.  Here are the “quick and dirty” main points:<br>  <br>  Prophase I - chromatin condenses into chromosomes, the nucleolus disappears, the nuclear membrane disappears, and the spindle apparatus forms.  Chromosomes come together as tetrads.  Prophase I is really important because this is where CROSSING OVER and INDEPENDENT ASSORTMENT happen. <br>  <br>  Metaphase I- tetrads line up on the equator, spindle fibers attach to the centromere.<br>  <br>  Anaphase I - tetrads are pulled apart by the spindle fibers. <br>  <br>  Telophase I - chromosomes reach the poles, so ONE SET of chromosomes is at each pole.  Chromosomes uncoil to form the chromatin again, nucleolus reforms. <br>  <br>  Prophase II- nuclear envelope re-dissolves, spindle fibers re-form, chromatin condenses back into chromosomes, spindle fibers re-attach.<br>  <br>  Metaphase II - chromosomes line up at the equator. Spindle fibers attach.<br>  <br>  Anaphase II -  chromosomes are pulled to opposite sides of the cell. <br>  <br>  Telophase II- chromosomes reach their poles, nuclear envelope re-forms, chromosomes uncoil, nucleolus reforms.<br>  <br>  Basically, Meiosis I is more important than Meiosis II because Meiosis I is where you get crossing over and independent assortment (in Prophase I) and you get a reduction from the diploid to the haploid condition (after Metaphase I).<br>  <br>  Meiosis II is a lot like Mitosis: You double the number of cells.<br>  <br>  One difference between sperm production and egg production: In sperm production, at the end of Meiosis you get four haploid sperm from one diploid body cell.  In egg production, three of the “would-be” eggs donate their cytoplasm to the fourth, so you only get one haploid egg from one diploid body cell.

zf8BnU6Yaa	In the Kuiper Belt and out to the Oort cloud lie a lot of things which we don't know about.  They are so far away from the sun that even fairly large objects will not reflect enough sun light to be easily observed from the earth.  The concept of Planet X was due to perturbations in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.  What we want to know is whether there is a planet large enough to cause comets and possibly asteroids to divert toward the inner solar system.  We know we see new comets on a regular basis and it is always possible that comets have struck the earth in the past and could do so in the future.  So knowing about our local system, is important if we are to understand what kind of risks there are to the earth.  We do know that there have been large bolides that have struck the earth and caused events which would possibly threaten our existence if one happened again.  So knowing about this stuff is kind of important.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	Yeah.. that's right.

The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (Planet X would, at the time, have been the ninth planet)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_planet#Planet_X" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_plane...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  (honestly a mute point I think.)<br>  <br>  so then they discovered pluto. then one by one found all the other planet like objects during the "search for a new planet x"<br>  <br>  hoaxers stole the idea, and it started out as almost the same concept.<br>  <br>  but now hoaxers use the term "planet x" for the name of the planet "nibiru" itself because they watch too many looney toons cartoons with marvin the martian, bugs bunny / duck dogers and porky pig and lost the original meaning of "planet x"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg-nI_etQ4c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg-nI_etQ...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the search for "planet x" continues, but it isn't as strong as it was because of all the planet like forms we have found.... and it has nothing to do with nibiru.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	"Tradition!"  <cue music from Fiddler on the Roof><br>  <br>  Seriously, "Planet X" is a hijacked term.  Originally it was the name for the planet beyond Neptune (Ceres being considered a planet at that time, made Neptune #9, so "X" meant "10").  <br>  <br>  Since then, it has been hijacked by wackos who want to scare people into buying their books.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	The term "planet X": has been around since Pluto was discovered in 1930.

pjApAUEQaa	You're on the right track, but you must use the product rule within your implicit differentiation.  Think of 1/3πr2 as one function and h as the other.  As in,<br>  <br>  dv/dt = 2/3πrh*dr/dt + 1/3πr2*dh/dt<br>  <br>  then plug in your values<br>  <br>  Alternatively, in cone problems, a corresponding radius and height always have the same ratio, in this case, r/h = 4/3.  That would allow you to substitute for one of the variables.  It's a good option, one that I usually use instead of keeping both variables around.<br>  <br>  Update: you shouldn't have an h in your second term, it became 1 when you took the derivative.

AA10335067	I disagree, I contend you do not need to know the mass of the box...it ends up canceling in the end.<br>  <br>  Think about what the phrase, "at constant velocity" means.<br>  When an object is moving with a constant velocity it means there is no acceleration, and when there is no acceleration the net force acting on the box equals zero.<br>  <br>  What forces are acting on the box?<br>  Obviously there is a frictional force which is acting up the slope to oppose the motion of the box down the slop;<br>  There is also a force which is acting down, parallel, to the slope which is acting to pull the box down.<br>  <br>  The force parallel to the slop equals,<br>  F_p = mg * sin (theta)<br>  Where theta is the inclination of the ramp.<br>  <br>  The force of friction equals the normal force * the coefficient of friction.<br>  The normal force equals,<br>  F_n = mg * cos (theta)<br>  So the frictional force equals,<br>  F_f = mg*cos(theta) * coefficient of friction<br>  <br>  Since there is no net force acting on the box the force parallel to the ramp must equal the force of friction,<br>  F_p = mg * sin (theta) = F_f = mg*cos(theta) * coefficient of friction<br>  m and g cancel out and you are left with<br>  sin (theta) = cos(theta) * coefficient of friction<br>  You are given the angle of inclination of the ramp (theta) so just solve for the coefficient.<br>  <br>  μ = cos (theta) / sin (theta) = tan (theta)|`|2a06e942cc7c2ffde54be22a29f102c6aa	As u know it that it has constant velocity so its acceleration will be zero thus F net = F friction<br>  thus by drawing the inclined plane<br>  So by taking the horizontal vector : mgsin(x)<br>  mgsin(x)=F net   [u= mew ; coefficient of friction)<br>  F net = u F normal<br>  F normal =mgcos(x) <br>  equating<br>  mgsin(x)=u*mgcos(x)<br>  u=sin(x)/cos(x)<br>  u=tan(x)<br>  u=tan 38.8<br>  here u go now u will find the ans as no mass is needed|`|6c2be2f9234ae63b1e07a17e279442ceaa	You don't need to know the mass - it will cancel out. <br>  <br>  The restraining force of kinetic friction is given by<br>  Ff = mu*N = mu*m*g*cos38.8<br>  <br>  The component of the mass's weight that points down the slope is a force, Fd, trying to accelerate the mass. It is given by <br>  Fd = m*g*sin38.8.<br>  <br>  Since the mass is at constant velocity, there are no unbalanced forces - the force of friction, Ff, and the force pointed down the slope, Fd, balance each other so,<br>  mu*m*g*cos38.8 = m*g*sin38.8<br>  <br>  Solve for mu|`|cb991f3b439a12d9e791cc75762c8fb6aa	Go to Discovery channel and look up E=Mc2 and you will find the person that came up with E, M, C2|`|AA10335036	You don't need to know the mass. The coefficient of friction is the ratio of the friction force to the normal force (force normal to the surface). The normal force exerted by an object of weight X on a slope is X*COS(angle). The force parallel to the surface is X*SIN(angle). With constant-velocity sliding the friction force equals the parallel force due to the weight. So the coefficient of friction = X*SIN(angle)/(X*COS(angle)) = SIN(angle)/COS(angle), or TAN(angle).

txC0p30daa	By using what you know about triangle properties, you can derive that an isoceles triangle with base length x has height (sqrt(3)x / 2), and therefore an area of sqrt(3)x^2 / 4.

3ea84e4fa10080966acac56a95e99f15aa	The extraction or purifying process separates the natural<br>  sugar stored in the cane stalk or beet root from the rest of<br>  the plant material. For sugar cane, traditional processing<br>  involves a) grinding the cane and pressing it to extract<br>  the juice; b) boiling the juice until it thickens and begins<br>  to crystallize; c) spinning and drying the crystals in a<br>  centrifuge to produce raw sugar; d) shipping the raw<br>  sugar to a refinery where it is e) washed and filtered to<br>  remove the last remaining plant materials and color; and<br>  f) crystallized, dried and packaged.<br>  Extracting beet sugar normally involves a continuous<br>  process in one facility. The sugar beets are washed,<br>  sliced and soaked in hot water creating a sugary juice. A<br>  series of steps similar to sugar cane processing—purification,<br>  filtration, concentration, and drying—completes<br>  the procedure.|`|bafa820adaaa4cf861c7e5853a049cd4aa	Cane sugar and beet sugar are similarly made, but different.<br>  <br>  <br>  Table sugar (sucrose) comes from plant sources. Two important sugar crops predominate: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), in which sugar can account for 12% to 20% of the plant's dry weight. Some minor commercial sugar crops include the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), and the sugar maple (Acer saccharum). In the financial year 2001/2002, worldwide production of sugar amounted to 134.1 million tonnes.<br>  <br>  The first production of sugar from sugar-cane took place in India. Alexander the Great's companions reported seeing "honey produced without the intervention of bees" and it remained exotic in Europe until the Arabs started cultivating it in Sicily and Spain. Only after the Crusades did it begin to rival honey as a sweetener in Europe. The Spanish began cultivating sugar-cane in the West Indies in 1506 (and in Cuba in 1523). The Portuguese first cultivated sugar-cane in Brazil in 1532.<br>  <br>  Most cane-sugar comes from countries with warm climates, such as Brazil, India, China and Australia. In 2001/2002 developing countries produced over twice as much sugar as developed countries. The greatest quantity of sugar comes from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean nations, and the Far East.<br>  <br>  Beet-sugar comes from regions with cooler climates: northwest and eastern Europe, northern Japan, plus some areas in the United States (including California). In the northern hemisphere, the beet-growing season ends with the start of harvesting around September. Harvesting and processing continues until March in some cases. The availability of processing-plant capacity, and the weather both influence the duration of harvesting and processing - the industry can lay up harvested beet until processed, but frost-damaged beet becomes effectively unprocessable.<br>  <br>  The European Union (EU) has become the world's second-largest sugar exporter. The Common Agricultural Policy of the EU sets maximum quotas for members' production to match supply and demand, and a price. Europe exports excess production quota (approximately 5 million tonnes in 2003). Part of this, "quota" sugar, gets subsidised from industry levies, the remainder (approximately half) sells as "C quota" sugar at market prices without subsidy. These subsidies and a high import tariff make it difficult for other countries to export to the EU states, or to compete with the Europeans on world markets.<br>  <br>  The U.S. sets high sugar prices to support its producers, with the effect that many former consumers of sugar have switched to corn syrup (beverage-manufacturers) or moved out of the country (candy-makers).<br>  <br>  The cheap prices of glucose syrups produced from wheat and corn (maize) threaten the traditional sugar market. In combination with artificial sweeteners, drink manufacturers can produce very low-cost products.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cane<br>  Cane-sugar producers crush the harvested vegetable material, then collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with lime (calcium oxide)) to remove impurities and then neutralize it with sulfur dioxide. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface and for skimming off. In cooling the liquid crystallises, usually in the process of stirring, to produce sugar crystals. Centrifuges usually remove the uncrystallised syrup. The producers can then either sell the resultant sugar, as is, for use; or process it further to produce lighter grades. This processing may take place in another factory in another country.<br>  <br>  <br>  Beet<br>  <br>  Beta vulgaris <br>  Main article: Sugar beet<br>  Beet-sugar producers slice the washed beets, then extract the sugar with hot water in a "diffuser". An alkaline solution ("milk of lime" and carbon dioxide from the lime kiln) then serves to precipitate impurities (see carbonatation). After filtration, evaporation concentrates the juice to a content of about 70% solids, and controlled crystallisation extracts the sugar. A centrifuge removes the sugar crystals from the liquid, which gets recycled in the crystalliser stages. When economic constraints prevent the removal of more sugar, the manufacturer discards the remaining liquid, now known as molasses.<br>  <br>  Sieving the resultant white sugar produces different grades for selling.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cane versus beet<br>  Little perceptible difference exists between sugar produced from beet and that from cane. Tests can distinguish the two, and some tests aim to detect fraudulent abuse of EU subsidies or to aid in the detection of adulterated fruit-juice.<br>  <br>  The production of sugar results in residues which differ substantially depending on the raw materials used and on the place of production. While cooks often use cane molasses in food, humans find molasses from sugar beet unpalatable, and it therefore ends up mostly as industrial fermentation feedstock, or as animal-feed. Once dried, either type of molasses can serve as fuel for burning.|`|56a75992b38cb1b186ebe58723c9f08baa	sugar is made from sugar cane or sugar bets and the juice from each is cooked down until it becomes a solid which is sugar. they harvest the cane or beets then squeeze the juice out of them and its boiled until all the liquid evaporates leaving the sugar.

The electrode which is attached to the negative pole of the battery, and which supplies electrons to the electrolyte, is called the CATHODE. Reduction takes place at the cathode.<br>  <br>  The electrode which is attached to the positive pole of the battery, and which accepts electrons from the electrolyte, is called the ANODE. Oxidation takes place at the anode.<br>  <br>  When a direct electric current is passed through an ELECTROLYTE (such as a molten salt or an aqueous solution of a salt, acid or base), chemical reactions take place at the contacts between the circuit and the solution. This process is called ELECTROLYSIS<br>  .<br>  <br>  Aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of its molten oxide, alumina (Al2O3). Because alumina has a very high melting point (2045 oC), the mineral cryolite (Na3AlF6) is added to lower the melting point in order that the elctrolysis may be carried out at about 950 oC. The electrolytic cell has carbon anodes and a carbon cathode (which forms the lining of the tank in which the electrolysis takes place). Carbon dioxide is formed at the anodes, and aluminium at the cathode. It is heavier than the molten alumina/cryolite mixture, and sinks to the bottom of the cell, where it is tapped off. The procedure is known as the Hall-Heroult process.
1PufpYnWaa	A defibrillator is a medical device used in the defibrillation of the heart. It consists of a central unit and a set of two electrodes. The central unit provides a source of power and control. The two electrodes are placed directly on or in the patient. The device is designed to deliver an electric shock to the patient, in an effort to stop ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. It is also used to stop the heart in an effort to allow it to reset it's natural pacemaker in supra ventricular tachycardias|`|gnTn3QY5aa	its called a defibrillator, but i'm not sure what the act of using one is called other than........reviving?|`|29JsVykJaa	This device is called a defibrillator. The two pads are actually placed so that as much of the heart is between the pads as possible. When the heart fibrillates, it jiggles like a bag of worms and does not pump blood, leading to death. Randomly generated impulses from the heart make the EKG look like a squiggly line. The charge from the defibrillator depolarizes all of the heart muscle cells, so that the normal cardiac pacemaker can hopefully start again and get the heart to pump blood. <br>  <br>  If the debrillator is used to stop an atrial arrythmia, one in the top chambers of the heart that is usually not immediately fatal, the process is called cardioversion instead. I had this done once for atrial fibrillation. Unfortunately, I was young and athletic at the time, and the IV Valium they used to sedate me was not enough, and I remember being shocked. <br>  <br>  I felt like a squirrel who had just been fried on an electrical transformer. Since then, I have developed a fondness for acorns, and I get into bird feeders.

yFhswTGoaa	Ok, this is my first time answering a chem. question, but I think I got this one.<br>  <br>  The formula to calculate energy is q= (m)(cp)(delta T)<br>  q is the energy in Joules or calories. m is mass in grams. cp is the specific heat in J/g degrees Celcius. delta t is change in temp.<br>  <br>  The formula for delta T is change in temp. = final temp. subtract initial temp.<br>  <br>  So you figure out the water first because it's specific heat is 4.184 J/g degrees Celcius and the temperature change is 32.5 - 24.0, so 8.50 degree Cel. <br>  <br>  For the mass, you have to convert the ml to grams, so mass = density times volume. Density of H2O is 1.00 g/ml so multiplied with 50.0  ml is 50.0 grams. So you input the mass, specific heat, and delta temp. values into the energy equation to get the energy of the water.<br>  <br>  Now the hint says, the energy lost from one system is gained by the other system. So that means that whatever positive energy value you got as an answer for the water is going to be negative energy value for the metal. Because energy gained is a positive q value and energy lost is a negative q value. <br>  <br>  So the equation to calculate specific heat is : q/ (m)(delta T)<br>  <br>  so cp= -q/ 23.8 (32.5-100.0) (notice how the q value is negative in this case because the metal lost heat.)<br>  <br>  Your answer should be in the unit J/g degrees Celcius.|`|ebea0b7eca17a9c14bcc8620e40b3913aa	The formula is q = m Cp delta T<br>  <br>  q = heat, m = mass, Cp = specific heat and delta T is final T - Initial T<br>  <br>  In your problem start with the water. It will gain heat. 50 ml of water = 50 grams.<br>  <br>  q = (50g) (1) (32.5-24.0)<br>  <br>  Now take this q as a minus (gives up heat) and use the same equation to solve for the Cp of the metal.<br>  <br>  m = 23.8 g and delta T = (32.5-100.0)<br>  <br>  Solve for Cp and you are done. The units will be cal/ gr oC|`|c97f29a57d4e5a8b3ed896d65b238ff6aa	well...<br>  <br>  First,  you check the change in thermal energy of the water:<br>  <br>  E = mc(change in t) <br>  <br>  where, m equals mass, and c equals specific heat:<br>  <br>  E= (.050 kg)(4.18)(32.5-24)<br>  E= 17.8 kJ<br>  <br>  Whatever energy water gains is the amount of energy that the metal loses. So you use the same equation:<br>  <br>  E=mc(change in t)<br>  -17.8 = (.0238 kg) (c) (32.5-100)<br>  -17.8 = -1.6065c<br>  11.07 = c<br>  <br>  So the specific heat of the metal is 11.07 kJ per Kelvin per kilogram, or 11,070 Joules per Kelvin per gram

43885d249f6e12d0c9543cbcbaffc9bbaa	To provide lift for the craft, air pressure is used.  Hovercraft are usually nothing more than a large fan pushing air downward inside a flexible skirt.  The force of the air lifts the craft - having to move only air greatly reduces the friction with the surface.  The flexible skirt is necessary so that a large portion of the air pressure is not lost to side movement instead of downdraft.<br>  An air hockey table does the same thing but its reversed.  The air pressure pushes the puck off the table instead of the air pressure lifting the puck off the table.<br>  Very little air pressure spread over a large surface area can provide a significant lift force.  Let's say you could produce 1 lb/sq in(psi)  over a 10 ft sq. area.  10 ft sq = 10x10 or 100 sq-ft x 144 sq in/sq ft x 1 lb/sq in =  14,400 lbs of force.  <br>  If there were no losses, 100% efficient, you could lift over 7 tons with 1 psi of air pressure spread over  100 square feet.<br>  Hovercraft utilize the same principle for lift  and have another fan for directional movement.|`|6TkbMIETaa	Pneumatics are used (air pressure), but it has to be concentrated, and there has to be quite a bit of air pressure.<br>  Best, and cheapest example of this would be an air hockey table.

A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals.

At standard temperature and pressure it is a colorless, odorless, nonmetallic, tasteless, highly flammable diatomic gas (H2). With an atomic mass of 1.00794 g/mol, hydrogen is the lightest element.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen is the most abundant of the chemical elements, constituting roughly 75% of the universe's elemental mass.[1] Stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. Elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on Earth, and is industrially produced from hydrocarbons such as methane, after which most elemental hydrogen is used "captively" (meaning locally at the production site), with the largest markets about equally divided between fossil fuel upgrading (e.g., hydrocracking) and in ammonia production (mostly for the fertilizer market). Hydrogen may be produced from water using the process of electrolysis, but this process is presently significantly more expensive commercially than hydrogen production from natural gas.<br>  <br>  The most common naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, has a single proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds it can take on either a positive charge (becoming a cation composed of a bare proton) or a negative charge (becoming an anion known as a hydride). Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr?dinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.<br>  Hydrogen gas, H2, was first artificially produced and formally described by T. Von Hohenheim (also known as Paracelsus, 1493 – 1541) via the mixing of metals with strong acids. He was unaware that the flammable gas produced by this chemical reaction was a new chemical element. In 1671, Robert Boyle rediscovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas.[4] In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by identifying the gas from a metal-acid reaction as "inflammable air" and further finding that the gas produces water when burned. Cavendish had stumbled on hydrogen when experimenting with acids and mercury. Although he wrongly assumed that hydrogen was a liberated component of the mercury rather than the acid, he was still able to accurately describe several key properties of hydrogen. He is usually given credit for its discovery as an element. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name of hydrogen when he (with Laplace) reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned. Lavoisier's name for the gas won out.<br>  <br>  One of the first uses of H2 was for balloons (or blimps). The H2 was obtained by reacting sulphuric acid and metallic iron. Infamously, H2 was used in the Hindenburg airship that was destroyed in a midair fire. The highly explosive hydrogen (H2) was later replaced in balloons by the unreactive Helium (He).

These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Evolution of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water.[31]<br>  <br>  Water splitting, in which water is decomposed into its component protons, electrons, and oxygen, occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms. Some such organisms — including the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria — have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast.[32] Efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize H2 gas even in the presence of oxygen.[33]<br>  <br>  Other rarer but mechanistically interesting routes to H2 production also exist in nature. Nitrogenase produces approximately one equivalent of H2 for each equivalent of N2 reduced to ammonia. Some phosphatases reduce phosphite to H2.<br>  <br>  Applications<br>  <br>  Large quantities of H2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries. The largest application of H2 is for the processing ("upgrading") of fossil fuels, and in the production of ammonia. The key consumers of H2 in the petrochemical plant include hydrodealkylation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking.[34] H2 has several other important uses. H2 is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of methanol. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid. H2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores.<br>  <br>  Apart from its use as a reactant, H2 has wide applications in physics and engineering. It is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding. H2 is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations, because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas. Liquid H2 is used in cryogenic research, including superconductivity studies. Since H2 is lighter than air, having a little more than 1/15th of the density of air, it was once widely used as a lifting agent in balloons and airships. However, this use was curtailed after the Hindenburg disaster convinced the public that the gas was too dangerous for this purpose. Hydrogen is still regularly used for the inflation of weather balloons.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen's rarer isotopes also each have specific applications. Deuterium (hydrogen-2) is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons, and in nuclear fusion reactions. Deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope effects. Tritium (hydrogen-3), produced in nuclear reactors, is used in the production of hydrogen bombs, as an isotopic label in the biosciences, and as a radiation source in luminous paints.<br>  <br>  The triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the ITS-90 temperature scale.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen as an energy carrier<br>  <br>      Main articles: Hydrogen economy and Hydrogen fuel<br>  <br>  Hydrogen is not an energy source, except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources costs more in energy to make than is obtained by burning it. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane) for less energy than required to make it, but these sources are unsustainable, and are also themselves direct energy sources (and are rightly regarded as the basic source of the energy in the hydrogen obtained from them).<br>  <br>  Molecular hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy, as a possible carrier of energy on an economy-wide scale. A theoretical advantage of using H2 as an energy carrier is the localization and concentration of environmentally unwelcome aspects of hydrogen manufacture from fossil fuel energy sources. For example, CO2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of H2 production from methane. Hydrogen used in transportation would burn cleanly, without carbon emissions. However, the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial.[35] In addition, the energy density of hydrogen gas is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources, unless the hydrogen is stored at extremely high pressure.

968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	1. True.  the inertia of a large dense object is less than teh inertia of a small dense object?<br>  <br>  If the objects have the same density, then the large object is more massive and therefore has more inertia.<br>  <br>  Mass and 'inertia'<br>  <br>  Physics and mathematics appear to be less inclined to use the original concept of inertia as "a tendency to maintain momentum" and instead favor the mathematically useful definition of inertia as the measure of a body's resistance to changes in momentum or simply a body's inertial mass.<br>  <br>  This was clear in the beginning of the 20th century, when the theory of relativity was not yet created. Mass, m, denoted something like amount of substance or quantity of matter. And at the same time mass was the quantitative measure of inertia of a body.<br>  <br>  The mass of a body determines the momentum P of the body at given velocity v; it is a proportionality factor in the formula:<br>  <br>      P = mv<br>  <br>  The factor m is referred to as inertial mass.<br>  <br>  But mass as related to 'inertia' of a body can be defined also by the formula:<br>  <br>      F = ma<br>  <br>  By this formula, the greater its mass, the less a body accelerates under given force. Masses m defined by the formula (1) and (2) are equal because the formula (2) is a consequence of the formula (1) if mass does not depend on time and speed. Thus, "mass is the quantitative or numerical measure of body’s inertia, that is of its resistance to being accelerated".<br>  <br>  This meaning of a body's inertia therefore is altered from the original meaning as "a tendency to maintain momentum" to a description of the measure of how difficult it is to change the momentum of a body.<br>  <br>  2. True.  Newton's First Law (also known as the Law of Inertia) states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and that an object in uniform motion tends to stay in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.

It forms when shale, which consists of clay minerals like the sediments from which it formed, is put under pressure with temperatures of a few hundred degrees or so. Then the clays begin to revert to mica minerals. This does two things: first, the surface of slate has a sheen and reflectance typical of mica, and second, the rock gets a pronounced cleavage direction, so that it breaks along flat planes. This new cleavage plane is not always the same as the original sedimentary bedding planes, and any fossils originally in the rock are usually erased. With further metamorphism, slate turns to phyllite, then schist or gneiss.|`|JGPwyd1oaa	if you mean heated, then it is true|`|UgHaEbjzaa	True, Slate is a metamorphic rock formed after shale is compressed and subjected to high temperatures under the earths crust

Also the fact that it is magnetic and coloured (liquid oxygen is pale blue) - both properties linked to unpaired electrons.

That's about 80% of what it was during the middle ages before the idiotic "green revolution."

1IOu09xeaa	Recessiveness.<br>  <br>  You have two of every gene, and this includes eye color: brown is the more dominant, blue is recessive (in actuality, eye color is more complicated, so I'll simplify things to make it brief.)<br>  <br>  If you have two of the dominant gene, then you'll have brown. If you have two of the recessive, you'll have blue. If you have one of each, you'll have brown, because even though you have a blue gene, the brown is dominant.<br>  <br>  So, each of your parents has a recessive gene, and you got both recessive genes from your parents and now have blue eyes.<br>  <br>  If you want more on eye color, read the other posts that I have up....|`|KvqLFPcMaa	Since i've just done Biology your both parents may have been the carriers of the recessive blue eye colour gene... but the brown was dominant so they had brown eyes... when they had you... 2 of the recessive genes which would of been about 25% have become dominant and so you have blue eyes...<br>  <br>  Something along those lines<br>  Btw..

Two major genes determine the color, and minor ones can determine variation. Actual eye color is made from a pigment called melanin. The amount of melanin varies between the color of the eye. For example, blue eyes have no melanin and brown eyes have a lot. When children are first born, they usually have blue eyes. Light then stimulates they eye to make melanin and color is usually determined by the time a person is three.|`|yab6j7vaaa	So do I. It's because although the blue gene is recessive, you have a one in four chance of receiving the recessive gene from both parents, thus resulting in a blue-eyed baby!
HUfkS4jBaa	Well, my eyesight is bad, so looking at that massive number for the volume proved challenging, but I converted it to be 6.0225 x 10^12 cm^3 in scientific notation. But anyway, back to the process. We know that the formula for a cylindrical volume is (A) * h = V, where A is the area of the base (the top of the lake) and h is the depth of the lake. Since we know two of the variables, the Volume and the Area, we can just plug those into the formula.<br>  <br>  (9.1x10^9) * (h) = 6.0225x10^12<br>  <br>  Next, just divide the right side by 9.1x10^9, and you'll have your answer in centimeters, which I found to be 661 cm. Hope this helps!

La denominación actual es “antagonistas de los receptores de la histamina”, su acción consiste en evitar el efecto aferente de la histamina en los diferentes tejidos del cuerpo.<br>  <br>  Los antihistamínicos son fármacos que se usan tanto para bloquear o disminuir los efectos causados en el organismo por la liberación de la histamina, y efectivamente se clasifican como de acuerdo a su mecanismo de acción, o por su estructura quimica.<br>  <br>  LA HISTAMINA (C5 H9 N3) es una sustancia química presente en algunas células del organismo, provoca muchos de los síntomas de las alergias, como secreciones en la nariz o estornudos. Cuando una persona es alérgica a una sustancia en particular, como un alimento o el polvo, el sistema inmune cree, erróneamente, que esta sustancia, normalmente inocua para el organismo, es en realidad nociva. En un intento de proteger al organismo, el sistema inmune desata una reacción en cadena que induce a algunas células del cuerpo a liberar histamina y otras sustancias químicas en el torrente sanguíneo. Después, la histamina actúa en los ojos, la nariz, la garganta, los pulmones, la piel o el tracto gastrointestinal de una persona y provoca síntomas de alergia. Es probable que haya oído hablar de los antihistamínicos.

2c6a4392fd871cb574ad07fc7531910daa	I am currently taking AP Chemistry and I have found the best way to remember is 1) make flash cards of all the formulas, and 2) practice. Most chemistry textbooks have practice problems that you can practice and most also have the answers so you can check to see where you might have messed up. Flash cards are the best suggestion though. Most questions will give away which formula to use just by stating one or two words. So just study and you will be fine.|`|BdT43Qb3aa	The best way to remember the formulas is to practice them in a lab environment.

bcfbc9400cc0c2fd709b36b968bea526aa	The best way that I know to apply this is in business.<br>  <br>  Here's an example:<br>  FidoZ Pet Food company makes a dog food that contains two ingredients (X & Y).  X (@ $10) is cheaper than Y (@ $25), so FidoZ wants to use as much of it as they can to maximize profits.  The government requires that for each part of X they use that they must use no less than 3Y + 50.  FidoZ needs to produce at least 1000 units of dog food, so how can they best minimize costs.<br>  Here are your constraints (equations):<br>  Min. cost = 10X + 25Y<br>  X >= 3Y + 50<br>  X + Y >= 1000<br>  These can be graphed & you can use substitution to solve the inequalities for X & Y & use that to calculate minimum cost.

You might do a web search for Linear Programming that's what this is called in the Business world.

0iuyakEAaa	El arco iris es un fenómeno óptico y meteorológico que produce la aparición de un espectro de luz continuo en el cielo cuando los rayos del sol atraviesan peque?as partículas de humedad contenidas en la atmósfera terrestre. La forma es la de un arco multicolor con el rojo hacia la parte exterior y el violeta hacia la interior. Menos frecuente es el arco iris doble, el cual incluye un segundo arco más tenue con los colores invertidos, es decir el rojo hacia el interior y el violeta hacia el exterior.<br>  <br>  A pesar de que el arco iris muestra un espectro continuo de colores, comúnmente se suele aceptar como siete los colores que lo conforman, los cuales son el rojo, naranja, amarillo, verde, azul, a?il (ó morado) y violeta.|`|hO4TdoH0aa	Bueno algunas respuestas tienen alguna lógica (espero a mia tambien) pero se equivocan en algo, DonDoe dijo que se remplasan por otras que siguen calendo... mmm... pero si cuando llueve no se ve el arcoiris! solamente cuando ya deja de llover es cuando aparece.. inclusive aparece algunas veces y no se ha presentado gota de lluvia. y si fuese por las nubes como dice hector... entonces tendramos unas nubes mlticolores...mmmmm...<br>  <br>  bueno mi teoria es esta.... cuando llueve la función principal es regular las temperaturas del ambiente, el aire frio baja  y el caliente sube, osea, el agua condensada cae (por eso notas que la lluvia es fria), mientras aquella que llamamos vapor de agua sube, ese vapor que es lo que estoy de acuerdo con hector son "peque?as gotas de agua" que acutan como divergentes de los haces de luz, en otras palabras dividen la luz proveniente de los rayos solares, por esa razon vemos el arcoiris.<br>  <br>  pero apenas las temperaturas actuan sobre el vapor  este comienza a enfirarse se condensa, formando nubes, luego se condensa cada dia mas hasta formar la "nubes negras" o "nubes de lluvia" que iniciaran el ciclo nuevamente.<br>  <br>  lo que me lleva a lo siguiente, no has ntado que cuando tienes una mangura regando plantas, cuando tienes el chorro a toda potencia no aprecias ningun arcoiris, pero si ese cohorro lo apretaras para crear una pantalla de llovisna podrias apresiar algunas veces un peque?o aroiris? lo mismo pasa coon las nubes,imaginate que las nubes son el chorro a tda potencia, en cuanto el vapor de agua es la llovisna que haces si apretases la manguera<br>  <br>  acerca de los colores, una esplicación sencila es que los colores viajan en un solo has de luz toditos juntos, pero, son distintos, osea sus ondas son distintas (la forma en la que viajan antes de llegar a tus ojos) algunos tienen amplitudes de ondas mas cortas otros mas anchas y asi, pero cuando atraviesan una gota que es un lente divergente (que divide la luz por su forma biconvexa, osea como una bolita) toma cada onda y las separa, mandandolas a diferentes direcciones provocando así que cada uno ocupe su devido espacio, pero como estos espacios noestan milimetricamente predispuestos en algunos momentos se intercalan por lo tanto puedes notar una especie de transcicion entre un color y otro, algunas personas dicen pueden contar más de 7 colores, lo que no es falso, pero esos colores de más son el mismo color pero en distinto tono (osea un morado claro y un morado oscuro)|`|EFur9rc9aa	tengo la misma duda|`|KlWly5TQaa	Cuando la luz solar incide sobre las gotas de lluvia, éstas se encargan de dispersarla en todas direcciones, pero en algunas mucho más que en otras. Los rayos del Sol involucrados con la formación del arco iris salen de las gotas de lluvia con un ángulo de aproximadamente 138 grados respecto de la dirección que llevaban antes de entrar en ellas. Este es el "ángulo del arco iris", descubierto por René Descartes en el a?o de 1637. Si la luz saliera a 180 grados, entonces regresaría por donde vino. Como el ángulo de salida es de sólo 138 grados, la luz no se refleja exactamente hacia su origen. Esto hace posible que el arco iris sea visible para nosotros, que no solemos encontramos exactamente entre el Sol y la lluvia. De manera que siempre, si nos colocamos de frente a un arco iris, el Sol estará detrás de nosotros.<br>  <br>  Un rayo de luz solar, de los que "hacen" un arco iris, cambia su dirección tres veces mientras se mueve a través de una gota de lluvia: Primero entra en la gota, lo cual ocasiona que se refracte ligeramente. Entonces se mueve hacia el extremo opuesto de la gota, y se refleja en la cara interna de la misma. Finalmente, vuelve a refractarse cuando sale de la gota de lluvia en forma de luz dispersa. La descomposición en colores es posible porque el índice de refracción de la gota de agua es ligeramente distinto para cada longitud de onda, para cada color del arco iris.<br>  <br>  La luz solar emerge de muchas gotas de lluvia a un tiempo. El efecto combinado es un mosaico de peque?os destellos de luz dispersados por muchas gotas de lluvia, distribuido como un arco en el cielo. Los diversos tama?os y formas de las gotas afectan la intensidad de los colores del arco iris. Gotas peque?as hacen un arco iris pálido y de colores con tonalidades pastel; gotas grandes producen colores muy vivos. Además, las gotas grandes son aplastadas por la resistencia del aire mientras caen. Esta distorsión ocasiona que el "final" del arco iris tenga colores más intensos que la cresta. Quizás sea ésta la causa de la leyenda que sugiere la existencia de una olla que contiene oro resplandeciente en el final del arco iris.<br>  <br>  en pocas palabras no se forma por una gota de lluvia sino por millones :P|`|gVf1oBAUaa	Duran tiempo por el vapor de agua que se encuentra condensado en las nubes. y tienen varios colores porque los rayos del sol atraviesan esas particulas de humedad. 1 solo rayo de luz logra que se formen esos colores, no es uno para cada color. <br>  Saludos|`|pOvwawRkaa	?

El arco iris se forma por muy peque?as  gotas de agua que se encuentran en suspención en el aire, te lo ago más fácil, si las gotas de agua no se pudieran mantener en el aire, las nubes se nos caerían en nuestras cabezas, ya que estas estan formadas por diminutas gotas suspendidas en el aire, lo que hace que caigan es una diferencia de temperatura la cual las condensa y hace que estas se hagan mas grandes y caigan por propio peso.

cJPOs7Tsaa	This one stumps a lot of people. READ CAREFULLY, there are subtle clues in the wording:    An Arab with three sons dies. In his will, he leaves his camels to his sons to be divided in the following way: The first born son is entitled to 1/2 of the camels, the second son is entitled to 1/3 of the camels, and his youngest gets only 1/9 of the camels. The problem is, that when he died, he had 17 camels. Not knowing how to be true to their father's will, the sons call upon the village wise man to help solve the problem. So, the next day, the wise man mounts his camel and rides over to their stables to see what the problem is. After the sons explained it to him, the wise man quite fairly divided the camels amongst the sons (without chopping them up, or dismembering any of them) just as outlined in the will. He then bids the sons fairwell, mounts his camel and rides off.    How did the wise man fairly divide the camels, and how many did each of the sons get?      Okay, so you got that one... omit the clue to make it really challenging.    Can you explain these mathematical illusions?    http://cheftonio.blogspot.com/2008/10/3-...

Try and get a placement at a setting where there are young people who have both physical and mental handicaps.    This experience will be invaluable to you in your future career.|`|kWuT9bVlaa	Volunteering in nursing homes, food banks and homeless shelters, mental health hospitals and help centers are all good ideas. It shows that you really care about helping people, and that you are getting out there trying to help with what ever you can. Red Cross is a good organization to take part of too. Along with that, maybe something that just interests you. Medical schools look for leadership skills. Anything where you can demonstrate that you are a good team leader is beneficial. Girl Scouts often times offers part time troop leaders positions, or assistant troop leader positions. Boys & Girls Clubs and Big Brothers/Big Sisters and the YMCA/YWCA is also very beneficial. There are endless possibilities.     Maybe even look into job shadowing different types of doctors that you know.|`|2WYvz73xaa	You've got some good advice so far, however, it's really important that you have gained something from all the experiences.  This is a key question in interviews but, for your own benefit, if you can honestly answer this question then you will ascertain if you are really applying to do medicine for the right reason.    If you can transfer these experience and skills over to the life of a doctor, then it will definitely help with your application.  Doing research on the medical schools you are applying to also helps.  This you would be doing anyway, as you are keen to find out how each medical school is run, the sort of facilities they have (eg Do they still have dissection sessions?  How many medical students are there?  What is the student:teacher ratio?).  These may be useful when writing up your personal statement a prepares you for medical school interviews.      Practise with other people with interview techniques, get lots of people to read your personal statement, constantly ask yourself why you want to do medicine.  If you are not sure, research areas you are interested and think of why you would/would not be suitable in certain medical specialities etc.    Hope that helps.    Good luck!|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	volunteering at animal cliinics/shelters cuz u will see the ilness/ injuries of animals & see how they r administered treatment by vets. volunteering at hospices and homes 4 the elderly r good educational expirences, too|`|FWOdlpx8aa	I think continuing the D of E with the aim of completing the gold award would be good, shows commitment / teamwork / leadership skills etc.    Maybe chose some suitable work experience.

JeUvm9NIaa	Pressure of a gas is  related to temperture. <br>  Since you decrease pressure with a vaccum, the temperture would decrease. the molecules would have more distance to cover before the bounce off another molecule. This is the same reason that temperture decreases as you go up in altitude.|`|unKG3qKZaa	If you are using a vacuum pump you are exhausting a gaseous mixture (normally) from a fixed sized closed rigid container. The volume of the container remains constant (apart from its expansion or contraction from temperature changes) so the volume of the gas in the vessel remains constant, its pressure however decreases as less and less gas occupies the same volume.<br>  Remember pv=nrt, assuming that temperature  remains constant. Volume is constant for a rigid container so pressure and n (number of moles of the gas) can change. r is a constant. <br>  The mass of the gas in the vessel reduces as does its pressure.

0cb3c9ed53731ec89cb43891b1eb9967aa	Pi or π is one of the most important mathematical constants, approximately equal to 3.14159. It represents the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter in Euclidean geometry, which is the same as the ratio of a circle's area to the square of its radius. Many formulas from mathematics, science, and engineering include π.<br>  <br>  It is an irrational number, which means that its decimal expansion never ends or repeats. Indeed: beyond being irrational, it is a transcendental number, which means that no finite sequence of algebraic operations on integers (powers, roots, sums, etc.) could ever produce it. Throughout the history of mathematics, much effort has been made to determine π more accurately and understand its nature; fascination with the number has even carried over into culture at large.<br>  <br>  The Greek letter π, often spelled out pi in text, was adopted for the number from the Greek word for perimeter "περ?μετρο?", probably by William Jones in 1706, and popularized by Leonhard Euler some years later. "π" is usually pronounced as pie when used in English in a mathematical context, although the letter is properly pronounced pee in Greek. The constant is occasionally also referred to as the circular constant, Archimedes' constant (not to be confused with an Archimedes number), or Ludolph's number.|`|39b0bfab26f51434fddde546c8696901aa	3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419...|`|9mUM9pJuaa	pi=3.14159<br>   circle's circumference|`|Iay8eLTAaa	Along with what has already been said, pi is an irrational number, meaning that it has no ending, no final digit.

Se trata de la "receta" de la seda que la viuda negra - una de las más resistentes del mundo arácnido - utiliza para tejer su telara?a. <br>  <br>  Concretamente, los investigadores de la Universidad de California en Riverside identificaron los genes y determinaron las secuencias de ADN de dos proteínas claves de la llamada seda "Dragline" de la viuda negra. Se logró identificar los genes que codifican las proteínas MaSp1 y MaSp2, y se pudo así determinar la secuencia completa del ADN de estos genes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Más sobre las telas de ara?a<br>  <br>  - Las ara?as tejen sus telas para atrapar a sus presas, hacer puertas para las madrigueras en el suelo, trasladarse ayudadas por el viento, hacer capullos con sus huevos e, incluso, para el cortejo. <br>  <br>  - Los machos de algunas especies presentan a las hembras moscas envueltas en telara?as para cortejarlas. <br>  <br>  - Las especies cazadoras submarinas utilizan las telara?as para cubrirse con una burbuja de aire para poder respirar bajo el agua. <br>  <br>  - Las ara?as no producen solamente un tipo de tela. Fabrican ?siete tipos diferentes!. <br>  <br>  - Por lo general, utilizan uno para envolver a sus presas una vez capturadas, otro para tejer un capullo para sus huevos, y cinco tipos para la construcción de las telara?as y otras estructuras, como el caso de las ara?as subterráneas, que excavan un hoyo en el suelo y fabrican una trampa o puerta con tierra y seda. <br>  <br>  - Cada tipo de hilo se produce en hilanderas diferentes, y está compuesto de diversas proteínas. <br>   <br>  Sucede que para hacer sus redes, las ara?as producen hasta siete tipos distintos de seda (ver recuadro), y la telara?a de la viuda negra está hecha principalmente de un tipo de seda llamada "Dragline", la cual es utilizada por este insecto como base estructural de su telara?a y para apoyar el peso de su cuerpo cuando se mueve por la tela. <br>  <br>  Este tipo de seda es conocida por sus extraordinarias propiedades de fuerza y flexibilidad. Es una combinación que permite a la seda absorber enormes cantidades de energía, y es por eso que su estructura y formación han sido durante mucho tiempo de enorme interés para los científicos. <br>  <br>  Y es que con la nueva información genética podría ser posible producir sintéticamente las proteínas de la seda y crear fibras que tengan las mismas propiedades asombrosas de la tela de la viuda negra.<br>  <br>  Cuando las ara?as fabrican su seda Dragline, las glándulas del arácnido secretan una sustancias pegajosa y espesa formada de las proteínas que necesita para el material. <br>  <br>  Ese material es transportado hacia la hilera - los apéndices que tienen las ara?as cuya función es dar soporte a las glándulas productoras de la seda - por medio de un conducto donde las proteínas interactúan para formar las hebras de seda. <br>  <br>  Ahora que el mapa genético de la tela ha sido identificado sería posible producir sintéticamente las proteínas, insertando las secuencias genéticas en organismos huéspedes, como bacterias, plantas o animales. <br>  <br>  El próximo paso de los científicos será introducir las proteínas a fibras de seda que tengan las mismas propiedades que las telas de ara?a. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hilo para suturas<br>  <br>  Hace más o menos dos a?os, dos estudiantes universitarias de la Universidad de Veracruz, al este de México, de las facultades de Ingeniería Ambiental e Ingeniería Química, llegaron a la conclusión de que la tela de ara?a podría servir para elaborar hilo para suturas. Esto, luego de estudiar las propiedades de la tela producida por la ara?a "Nephila maculata", que existe en las inmediaciones de Coatepec, en el centro del estado.<br>  <br>  El trabajo de campo se realizó exactamente en las localidades de Mahuixtlán, donde la especie Nephila Maculata es abundante. De hecho, en algunas zonas, de esta especie hay en promedio ?tres ara?as por metro cuadrado!. <br>  <br>  Las científicas se dieron cuenta que en la región la gente utiliza la tela de ara?a como remedio para algunas heridas, ya que les coagula la hemorragia y les cicatriza las heridas, cerrándolas por completo.<br>  <br>  Lo anterior, debido a la resistencia y condición antimicrobiana que poseen las telara?as. Por lo mismo, la tela impide que sobre ella se asienten microbios, y así pueden ser utilizadas en operaciones quirúrgicas. También es muy elástica y no se disuelve con el alcohol. <br>  <br>  Científicos tambien se percataron de que es viable hacer cultivos de tela de ara?a en laboratorios para ser usada con propósitos terapéuticos.  hicieron pruebas microbiológicas y fisioquímicas con carbohidratos, proteínas y lípidos sobre los tejidos, con lo cual se comprobó su tensión y solubilidad. <br>  <br>  ?De qué están hechas las telara?as?Pero no toda esta fama es merecida. Es cierto que por lo general son carnívoras y se alimentan de presas vivas, las que logran atrapar con sus redes. ?Pero tampoco son tan malas!. Hay más de 34 mil especies de ara?as, las que pueden medir entre 1 y 9 centímetros de largo. En general tienen 4 pares de ojos y ocho patas y producen seda, las que tejen en torno a ellas para cazar insectos. <br>  <br>  Todas las ara?as, salvo las de la familia Uloboridae, son venenosas. Son más venenosas las ara?as que "cazan" activamente, mientras que las que esperan a sus presas al acecho o las atrapan por medio de una red son menos peligrosas. <br>  <br>  Casi siempre tienen glándulas para inyectar veneno, pero sólo en algunos casos (0,05 %) su picadura es peligrosa para el ser humano. De hecho, sólo la viuda negra en algunas ocasiones, la Ara?a de Rincón y la Tela de embudo más frecuentemente, pueden resultar peligrosas.<br>  <br>  Cuando pican, inyectan un veneno que permite inmovilizar a la presa o bien ayudan a la "digestión externa" de la presa, de modo que la ara?a absorbe la papilla resultante. Algunas ara?as migalomorfas (tarántulas americanas) tienen además pelos urticantes, los que producen irritación cuando se tocan y pueden da?ar áreas delicadas, como los ojos.<br>  <br>  La tela de una ara?a está compuesta principalmente de proteínas, es decir, de aminoácidos (que forman dichas proteínas). En el caso de las telara?as, los aminoácidos principales son la glicina y la alanina. La ara?a los produce por medio de unas glándulas llamadas "hilanderas", en la parte posterior de su abdómen. <br>  <br>  Estas glándulas unen las proteínas para crear una seda flexible y resistente. Cuando a esta seda se a?ade una sustancia pegajosa, el resultado es una "trampa" muy eficiente.<br>  <br>  El hilo de una ara?a puede llegar a ser cinco veces más resistente que un filamento de acero de igual grosor. Incluso se ha dicho que si se tuviera un hilo de ara?a del grueso de un lápiz, ?podría llegar a detener un avión Boeing 747 en pleno vuelo!. <br>  <br>  Además, el hilo de una ara?a se puede estirar hasta el 30 por ciento más de su largo original sin romperse. Por lo mismo, está más que comprobado que las telas de ara?a son unos de los materiales más resistentes que se conocen.<br>  Ya que la orinoterapia, como muchas técnicas médicas alternativas y complementarias, apenas ha sido investigado "científicamente" (?quién va a pagar la investigación, si no se puede patentar para poder recuperar la inversión?), pueden ser útil para los lectores las experiencias (positivas o negativas) de personas que hayan probado esta técnica. Lo que no está claro es donde deben ponerse tales experiencias, si en la página principal de este tema (aquí), en la página de discussiones, o en una página web externa. De momento, como traductor original de este tema, dado que alguién ya ha puesto un comentario de este tipo, he creado esta sección de "experiencias". Al fin y al cabo, las investigaciones científicas consisten en las experiancias personales de los participantes, sólo recogidas de forma más controlada y protocolizada.<br>  <br>  Mi propia experiencia de la orinoterapia es esta: Empecé tras leer que puede ayudar a las mujeres con problemas derivados de la menopausia, a?go que afectaba a mi pareja. Quise comprobar que no tiene efectos secundarios. (En este momento, llevo varios a?os bebiendo un vasito de mi orina cada ma?ana, y nunca he observado efectos negativos). Tras unas semanas, me di cuenta de que no había sufrido ningún ataque de alergia, un problema que habia empezado a sufrir algunos a?os antes y que iba de mal en peor (me refiero al llamado fiebre del heno: picor de ojos, goteo de nariz, sensación febril...). Y ahora puedo afirmar que desde que empecé con la orinoterapia, únicamente he sufrido unos episodios (muy pocos) de alergia muy leves, que atrubuyo a entrar en contacto con algún irritante nuevo,y basta ese primer contacto para que el irritante no me vuelve a producir alergia. También noto que ahora no me resfrío.<br>  <br>  !Saludos Cordiales!|`|9253be93a583042111eeabed1d71df0faa	es como el veneno de las serpientes,de ahi mismo sacan el antidoto!!|`|dO8WzGrZaa	mira, que es lo que tienes en tu cabeza mas específicamente en tu caja craneal ,,, "tu cerebro" para que sirve este impresionante aparato de ultima generación nunca igualado por ningún otro equipo creado por el hombre, pues sirve para dirigir a tu cuerpo este cuerpo que se creo perfectamente para crecer reproducirse y morir, además de hacer maravillas, y si algún factor altera este equilibrio llamado hemostasis, pues tu cerebro hará algo para manifestarse como la fiebre, inchazon, gripe , etc. para que tu lo puedas remediar, entonces si acudes a soluciones caseras como orina tela de ara?a plantas raras no se comer eces :S pues con tanta fe que tienes tu cerebro mismo se enga?a y pasa por alto el estimulo, (cosa peligrosa) y lo que da?a a tu cuerpo ya no lo sientes, eso si solo ya no lo sientes pero el estimulo sigue ahí es un proceso complejo que por el sue?o que tengo no te explico :P es simplemente psicología si dejas de creer en esos remedio s pues no te harán ningún efecto, pero eso si no todos son simples tabues o mitos algunas sirven, pero la mayoría son mitos by salu2|`|hO4TdoH0aa	eso te lo explica mejor un homeopata|`|ugCT2HApaa	menos mas menos igual mas<br>  <br>  Atte.: Dr Picapiedra|`|bICF9P5Naa	De la orinoterapia tengo MUY poca información, lo que se es que en la orina hay 2 tóxicos: la urea y el ácido úrico.

You will think you are missing information because you don't have the base dimension of the cones, but remember they're "similar" that means they are proportionate to each other. Just pick a number for one of them and adjust it accordingly to the other two. Use it to figure out the volume of the wood cone and then the total volume of the two plastic cones. Then express them in ratio form. W:P (If I remembered the formula I'd solve it but I can't)

It then begins spinning. When the bullet "magically fires" it travels down the barrel moving with the gun, but the direction it is facing is still constant. When it is released from the barrel, if there was a small bit missing from one side of the barrel, it would be "knocked" by the other side so its tragectory would change and thus it could possibly curve, otherwise it constantly travels "straight" due to no change in pressure/force.|`|m2pNTLloaa	Don't know the film "Wanted."

Jangan beranggapan ilmu-ilmu itu adalah ilmu hafalan atas rumus-rumus. Hal ini akan membuat anda malas mempelajari nya dan akhirnya tidak mengerti apa-apa tentang ilmu itu. Sejatinya ilmu-ilmu itu bukanlah ilmu menghafal rumus, pahami konsepnya, tanpa pemahaman rumus yang sudah dihafal tidak akan bermanfaat.<br>  3. Hilangkan anggapan ilmu-ilmu itu adalah ilmu abstrak dan tidak berhubungan dengan realita. Fakta menunjukkan ilmu-ilmu ini sangat realistis. Seperti : hampir di semua sektor, teknologi, ekonomi dan bahkan sosial, matematika berperan secara signifikan.<br>  4.

You can't work out the force of attraction without knowing the current in the   circuit ( and that means knowing the resistance).<br>  <br>  This is a neat case where two apparently similar things ( the direction of the current in the wires) cause an attraction. What does the attracting is the magnetic field established by the currents. From  one rod the field will by "down" and from the other the field will be "up" so actually we are back with "opposites attract".

YdGsp59kaa	Yes, we really did land on the Moon.  All the relevant experts agree that the evidence is authentic.    Your video is an excerpt from David Percy's 4-hour video "What Happened on the Moon?"  Percy has no training in photographic interpretation.  He mistakes the astronauts' VHF antenna for a wire glint.  (Hint: Hollywood has used carbon-coated wires since the 1930s to prevent this.  Why didn't NASA?)    David Percy has been invited twice to defend his findings against the criticism of recognized experts.  He has twice declined.  He does not take questions about his claims.  The official response from him and his co-author when asked to substantiate their claims is that you must buy their book and video to understand what they say.    Who is more likely to have a proper understanding of the facts:  a small-time cameraman with no training in photographic analysis and a bunch of stuff he wants to sell you, or all the world's experts combined?|`|NgUbzaF9aa	YES    Why is it even something that needs to be discussed.

z7BiMSWmaa	Sterility is often taken as a synonym to infertility, though they both mean disability to bear a child yet they have a very basic difference. Infertility mostly point at the inability to conceive, which may be because of various internal or external factors. Sterility means when the person is unable to reproduce sexually, this mostly is because of problem in the reproductive system.     Infertility might exist because of certain abnormalities that might not be related to the reproductive system. At times infertility exist because of stress, emotional shocks or side effect of any treatment, but sterility is very restricted to the reproductive system like damage in ovaries or varicose veins in the testicles might cause sterility.|`|89602e1135a635cfd549eb28bf240997aa	Sterility is the permanent inability to reproduce. This could be caused voluntarily or due to illness or injury. Infertility can be either a permanent or temporary inability for fertilization to occur. Infertility does not mean a child could not be produced through artificial means. If the problem is on the male side there are measures that can be taken to help increase sperm count and viability, or a sperm donor can be used. if the problem is on the female side fertility drugs can be used or artificial insemination with embryos can implanted. Sterility means that there is no production of sperm or eggs or that the uterus has been removed.

HyUE9ON0aa	A city can be defined as an area which is the hub of economic as well as administrative activities supporting a large population involved in various business and industrial occupations. Though in the United States a number of places having a relatively low population and distinctly rural in character are classified as cities.    If population is considered as the sole criterion and the minimum number of persons for a place to be designated as a city is considered to be 200,000 then there are about 95 cities in the United States. Today there are about 800 places in the United States which are listed as cities in varying degrees from population and median household income to property rates and literacy being some of the parameters used for designating a place as a city.     On a global scale there are 10 cities in the United States with a population of more than a million people among which New York occupies first place with a population of 8 million people excluding the metropolitan areas. The major concentration of population is in the eastern part of the country and the states of California and Texas and it is in these regions primarily that one finds a number of urban areas.    The major cities in the United States may be listed as follows:    1. New York  2. Los Angeles  3. Chicago  4. Houston  5. Philadelphia  6. San Francisco  7. Miami  8. Washington DC
HyUE9ON0aa	http://www.culturalresources.com/images/...    Kansas was admitted to the Union as the 34th state in January 1861, a few months before war broke out.     West Virginia was admitted in 1863 and Nevada in 1864.     So there were 34 states at the beginning of the war and 36 at the end.      @@@    Technically... Any of the Confederate States were no longer States during the War. The Union had to fight to regain control of the Confederacy (Confederate States of America).    "There were 23 states that remained loyal to the Union during the war: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. During the war, Nevada and West Virginia joined as new states of the Union. Tennessee and Louisiana were returned to Union control early in the war."    "Seven Deep South cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. These seven states formed the Confederate States of America (February 4, 1861), with Jefferson Davis as president, and a governmental structure closely modeled on the U.S. Constitution. In April and May 1861, four more slave states seceded and joined the Confederacy: Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. Virginia was split in two, with the eastern portion of that state seceding to the Confederacy and the northwestern part joining the Union as the new state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863."    "The Border states in the Union comprised West Virginia (which broke away from Virginia and became a separate state), and four of the five northernmost slave states (Maryland, Delaware, Missouri, and Kentucky)."|`|6KWgCrdCaa	This is a map that was published in 1865 (end of the Civil War) and the States that existed.

239bf03f74eeaad4c18a8972abf502cdaa	Using Raoult's law, you can calculate the mole fraction of benzene and the solute. From this you get the number of moles os solute and hence its molar mass.<br>  <br>  Assuming ideal mixture, Raolu's law states that vapor pressure of each component equals it liquid mole fraction times pure component vapor pressure. Total vapor pressure equals the sum of the components vapor pressures. Since solute is considered nonvolatile it has no vapor pressure. So the vapor pressure of the solution is identical to the vapor pressure of benzene in the mixture:<br>  pv = x(B) ? pv°(B)<br>  So the mole fraction of benzene is:<br>  x(B) = pv / pv°(B) = 0.900atm / 0.930atm = 0.96774<br>  <br>  Mole fraction is number of moles of benzene divide by total number of moles:<br>  x(B) = n(B)/(n(S) + n(B)) <br>  <br>  Solve for the number of moles of solute<br>  x(B) = 1/(n(S)/n(B) + 1) <br>  <=><br>  n(S)/n(B) = 1/x(B) - 1<br>  <=><br>  n(S) = n(B) ? ( 1/x(B) - 1) = n(B) ? (1 - x(B))/x(B)<br>  <br>  The number of moles benzene in the mixture is<br>  n(B) = m(B)/M(B) = 78.11g / 78.11g/mol = 1mol<br>  <br>  Hence:<br>  n(S) =  1mol ? (1 - 0.96744)/0.96744 = 0.03333mol<br>  <br>  The molar mass of the solute is<br>  M(S) = m(s)/n(s) = 10.0g / 0.03333mol = 300g/mol
92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	This is a conservation of energy problem--not conservation of momentum.<br>  <br>  The simplest way to do this is to work in Saturn's frame of reference.<br>  <br>  Calculate the speed of the spacecraft with respect to Saturn.<br>  <br>  v' initial = vspacecraft - vsaturn<br>  <br>  Then, according to conservation of energy, the spacecraft leaves with the same kinetic energy (and hence speed) with which it entered, but (they tell you) it flies off in the opposite direction.<br>  <br>  v' final = -v' initial<br>  <br>  So the last step is to convert back to the sun's reference frame:<br>  v final = v' final + vsaturn<br>  = 2 vsaturn - vspacecraft<br>  <br>  The masses don't matter except to establish (in case you didn't know) that the mass of Saturn is much, much bigger than that of the satellite, so it doesn't pick up a significant amount of kinetic energy in the interaction.<br>  <br>  --I'm not saying momentum isn't conserved.  It's just that it isn't really useful for solving this problem.  Because Saturn is so much bigger than the satellite, you don't need it.  You can just assume that the satellite doesn't lose any energy to Saturn.  If they wanted to make this problem non-trivial, they could make the satellite a big moon or something with a mass which is significant compared to Saturn's.  Then you have to consider conservation of momentum AND conservation of energy.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	Really great Q. It bothered me until I talked to an astronomer<br>  Key ideas: The interaction is gravitational, no physical contact.<br>  Energy is conserved,  Momentum  (P) is conserved.<br>  Because of the huge mass difference there is no measurable change in Saturn's P or E.<br>  <br>  There is a point of view. From the sun (or earth); from Saturn and  from the space craft .The laws of physics are the same for all but the apparent motions differ.<br>  <br>  Point of view saturn: Space craft approaches at Vs (V seen by Saturn), just misses, swings around, and leaves at Vs opposite direction.<br>  <br>  PoV earth: Craft approaches Saturn at Ve , Saturn moves Vs toward the craft.<br>  they "almost collide". Craft leaves with Ve + 2Vs because it not only had to leave with the speed of saturn just to turn around it had to leave at twice its Vs approach speed to get out of <br>  Saturn's way. <br>  <br>  PoV earth the craft gained kinetic energy. How?<br>  At the expense of Saturn's, P and E but the change was too small for earth measure.<br>  <br>  The analogy is: Pitcher throws ball, Batter swings bat, ball and bat collide, P,E exchange. Mass Bat (and batter) >> ball.<br>  Ball has V pitcher + 2 V Bat., Home run.  Ball went out of the park. Spaceship goes out of the solar system.
cabf56d794d5f75229ae80ef3688a2c4aa	Any rational zero must be a factor of the constant term (since coeff of x? is 1).  Try x = 1, doesn't work, try x = -1     1 - 5 - 2 + 18 - 12 = 0  Therefore x = -1 is a zero and so x + 1 is a factor.  Divide, to get  f(x) = (x + 1)(x3 + 4x2 - 6x  - 12)  Again, try factors of 12 in the cubic polynomial, and we find that   23 + 4*22 - 6*2  - 12   = 8 + 16 - 12 - 12 = 0  Therefore x = 2 is a zero and x - 2 is a factor.  Divide, to get  f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 2)(x2 + 6x + 6)  Using the quadratic formula (or completing the square) the zeros of the quadratic factor are -3 3.  So we have all four zeros, two of them rational and the other two irrational.

AA10277342	Start with:  ax^2 + bx + c = 0    Divide through by "a":  x^2 + (b/a)x + c/a = 0    Rewrite:  x^2 + (b/a)x = -c/a    Make the left side a "perfect square" by  "completing the square".  Since the leading  term has a coefficient of "1", we simply  need to add the square of half of the "x" term:  x^2 + (b/a)x + (b/2a)^2 = -c/a + (b/2a)^2  x^2 + (b/a)x + (b^2/4a^2) = -c/a + (b^2/4a^2)    Since the left side is a perfect square,  factor it:  (x + b/2a)^2 = -c/a + (b^2/4a^2)    Put the right side over a common denominator:  (x + b/2a)^2 = (4a)*(-c)/(4a*a) + (b^2/4a^2)  (x + b/2a)^2 = (-4ac)/(4a^2) + (b^2/4a^2)  (x + b/2a)^2 = (b^2-4ac)/4a^2    Now take the square root of each side:  (x + b/2a) = +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac)/2a    [I'm using "+/-" to mean "plus or minus"]    Subtract b/2a from each side:  x  = -b/2a +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac)/2a    Since they share a common denominator,  combine the fractions on the right side:  x  = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a    done.

But use pictures and models for those who learn best by seeing, use a reading for those who learn best by reading things, talk to them about it for those who learn by hearing, and then do an activity or worksheet type thing, to make sure everyone really understands DNA, and give a hands on experience, which is also a way that people learn things.|`|AA10313787	DNA is the order form filled out by mother nature to determine our factory options.|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	You might be too fixated on an image and not what DNA actually is- an alphabet. Ours has 26 letters, but the DNA variety has just 4. The DNA alphabet forms "words" out of the 4 letters. Just draw a circle and in the middle of the circle compose a "word" using the letters C,G, A and T. Say that this is an egg, but eggs speak a special egg language. The egg language for "chicken" is "CGATT". Therefore, this is a chicken egg and (with luck) will grow up into a chicken. Of course, there is also sperm language. It is sort of the opposite of egg language. For every A there is a T and for every C there is a G. "Chicken" in sperm language is therefore "GCTAA". Of course, everybody knows that when a sperm meets an egg a new chicken is created. The point is that everybody has two DNA names, one an egg name and one a sperm name. Also, it explains why chicken's can't cross with aardvarks - they have different names!    FYI: Watson and Crick were an American/British team credited with discovering the structure of DNA. The scientists used the technique of x-ray crystallography to form a 3 dimensional picture of the structure. However, there came a point at which the data became meaningless and research stopped. Another member of the team was an expert in this field and had made a number of very accurate x-ray measurements. However, "terrible Rosy" was arrogant and anti-social. Her notes were stolen and the discovery made, but sadly, she is never given credit. Same is true of Benjerman Franklin (a fool!) and President Adams (cantankerous old goat, but saved America from being a French colony after the war).
