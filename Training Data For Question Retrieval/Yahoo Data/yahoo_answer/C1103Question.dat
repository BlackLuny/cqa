She said it wasn't a big deal but the amount of pain I was in last night is something I don't want to do again so avoiding touch-up is my goal here.  I am sick of wearing tank tops and strapless shirts (it's february!).  When can I put regular clothes on without the chance of it seeping or messing up the tattoo?  I have to go back to work Sunday so do you think it will be okay then?  Thanks!

In my last 2 years of middle school (7th and 8th grade) I was called ugly by both guys, girls, and even the really ugly guys and girls. Now I'm a freshman in High School and a guy from another School tried to ask me out, called me pretty and asked for my phone number. I think he called me but I didn't make it in time to answer. It's been a couple months now and I haven't seen him, but I know I will.   Now that I'm in High School I have mostly guys for friends (it could also be because I'm a bit of a tomboy) and only 2 girls for friends. A dude in my 1st and 2nd period sometimes calls me sexy( i'm not sure if he's serious or joking.      But why was I called ugly in middle school, but dudes find me attractive? Is it because everyone has their own version of beauty?   Another person's ugly is another person's beauty?

I have been in touch with a 'One Source Talent' spokesperson or whatever you want to call her and she asked me to come into the san diego office to be measured and to do a thorough evaluation. I just looked up how the service is with them (one source talent) and there are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many horrible reviews about how people payed like $500 and waited and kept paying and never got a job. My evaluation is scheduled for this monday but i dont know if i should go in cus im worried that ill be scammed. i'll b honest... i dont have a lot of money and im definitely not in a position to pay $400 and monthly payments just to be completely ripped off. My main questions are:   *What will they ask me during the evaluation?    *What things do you do while there?(read scripts, take photos, etc.)   *How much do you pay?   *Do you actually get jobs?   *Is it a scam and should i go somewhere where I use my talent to become big in the industry and not my wallet?

20090220112337AAXhSMo	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	I had an unpleasant experience in an expensive shop- should I complain?	Yesturday I went to AllSaints, a fairly expensive shop, to purchase a dress which cost ￡95 (about $170).    Because of the recession, the shop was fairly empty- there were about three customers and about seven sales assistants. Yet when I walked in, I wasn't greeted and as I searched for the dress I wanted I wasn't offered any assistance.   After trying some items on, there was nowhere to place the unwanted items, and the look the sales assistant gave me intimadated me into running around the store to put the items back.   When I went to the till to pay for my dress, I had to wait a good seven or eight minutes, despite there being plenty of free sales assistants and nobody else at the till, and then I was rudely asked, 'you getting that?' before the girl attempted to force the store card onto me. She then shoved my delicate silk dress into a far too small shopping bag when there were small ones on the desk, and I left the shop disappointed- being seventeen and not rich, when i've saved for something nice i'd like to be treated well in the shop.   I plan to email head office with a complaint, and have the name and till number of my cashier on my receipt, but should I name her? Working in a shop myself, I would be desperately upset if I was having a bad day or whatever and somebody complained about me... but she treated me poorly, and I will not be returning to the shop because of her. What do you all think?

I'm looking for a good hair salon that specializes in alternative/punk/unconventional hairstyles and unusual color. I want to bleach my hair to a very light platinum with perhaps some greenish blue throughout and have choppy layers and sides-wept bangs. There are no salons around here that I can go to, and no one I can ask where they got their hair done. Whenever I do this, they give me a salon that's way out of town that I'm unable to look more into. I've tried googling for salons but haven't come across anything that sounds promising. I would be willing to travel for a good hair cut and dye. I live in southeastern PA, so I'd be willing to go as far as southwestern New Jersey, northern Delaware, northern Maryland, or New York City. As long as I can easily drive to the salon myself or get there by train, I don't mind the city. I also don't want to spend more than $175 total for the cut and color.      Please, ANY help or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you.

20090220120707AAu4ZjR	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Big Forehead a problem?	I've always had a big forehead.   And I want to have a short hair cut but I'm worried about getting teased at school because of it.      I currently have long-ish hair covering my forehead.      Anyway, I'm in the process of building up my shoulders to make my head look smaller (I've heard this works).      So my question summary is:      1. Should I care/worry about being teased at school because of my head?      2. Does the 'building up shoulders' stuff actually work?      3. How do you feel about people with big foreheads?      :)

Ok so the artist drew what I asked her to I brought a pic of a skull with long curly pigtails..and showed her a pic of wings I liked  and told her I wanted roses.. She does custom work, no flash so I knew she was going to make it her own..I also wanted the skul to look sad so she changed the skull..      She also made the pigtails braids...Well I LOVE everything except the braids so I told her this and she drew a ringlet which I still wasn't sure about...   We communicate through email she sends me a pic I tell her how I feel she changes it..      She said its no problem since all she does is erase the braid and tries something else but I still feel really bad. And don't want her to be annoyed by me..but it does have to be on me forever..      So have you had to do this? Do tattoo artist get mad about this.

I want to know how all you ladies function having something permanently stuck between your butt cheeks all day. Are they really that comfortable? I think that you would always be trying to pick it out, or do you just strap them on and deal with it?      P.S. Keep thonging.

20090220131115AAKWyPA	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Help, I am a male with a huge eyebrow problem - need advice?	I used to have (and still comes back now and then) trichotillomania. When I get nervous I pull my eyebrows out. I have gotten better at controlling myself so I have a lot of new hair growth, but its not perfect. My eyebrows are not as long (beginning to end wise) and neat as they used to be. A lot of the hairs stick straight outward because the follicles have obviously been damaged and thats just how they grow now. I trim them regularly to try to keep them as neat as possible. Anyway to make a long story short, this problem with my eyebrows has ruined the past year of my life. I have no self confidence in myself. I never see myself getting a girlfriend again, because I hear thats all girls look at since they are obsessed with eyebrows. Up close my eyebrows look really bad. I found a picture of a guy online that looks like me. He has eyebrows that look like mine(he had an eyebrow transplant), same color and everything, and for the most part the same length. I will show you the picture and I want to know if it looks bad when eyebrows are that short, as in they dont reach all the way to the nose, because thats how mine are. Mine just cant make it all the way to my nose anymore, so I have a pretty big gap like this guy. Sorry for going on and on but this is really bugging me. Anyway heres the pic. Look at the after pic to see what im referring to. Thanks for reading and please don't post if you are just going to be rude.       http://www.hairtransplant.com/month/pati...

Guys, if there wasn't any propaganda about how lame briefs underwear is, or how boxers are "cooler" to wear, if you wouldn't get "made fun of", if girls didn't care, would you wear tighty whities? If not white, at least briefs in general? What if the new style was to wear briefs/tighty whities again, such as the way boxers came about and how you weren't cool unless you wore boxers.

Ok I went to a hip hop show yesterday and their was lots of different people there..saw a few cool tattoos...but OH MY GOSH I saw a guy with a shaved head and random ugly tattoos all over the back of his head...I couldn't really make out what they were but whatever they were they sucked.      And then the guy turns around and he has devil horns tattooed above his forhead and what I swear looked like a unibrow tattooed abouve his eyebrows..      He also had something tattooed on his chin (a beard to complete the devil look perhaps)   It was all done with I could only guess was a homemade gun maybe in jail I don't know but no one worthy of working in even the worst shop..      I wish I had got a better look but I didn't want to gawk too obviously..         I also have a friend with a bunch of random amateur tattoos all over her back arms and chest...but this guy "wins" hands down..      So what's the stupidest tattoo you have ever seen?..

20090220110101AAwNsST	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Does putting spoons in the freezer and then putting them under your eyes really work?	So I have dark circles under my eyes. I tried the neutrogena eye roller. It said to use twice a day and you will see results in a week. It's been over a month so it's not working for me. and I'm sure it hasn't worked for anyone else. So if I put two spoons in the freezer over night and then in the morning or noon put them where my dark circles are at will it work? if so how long should i keep it under my eye and how many times should I do it before I see results. If this does not work do you know anything else besides concealers that will help reduce dark circles. and by the way I'm in a tight budget so please don't list anything pricey but something that DOES work. Thanks!

Much Barbie-bashing to be had, but here's the real question for all of you.      If you were to design a Barbie doll in the here and now, Mattel came to you to design the next incarnation of the world-famous doll, and you know you would jump at the chance of that! Don't lie and say you would not do it because that's not true. What would she look like? What color hair? What would be her bodily dimensions? Would she be made out of plastic, rubber or some other materials? How long will you make her legs?

20090220150641AAnXYMs	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should I get layers in my hair? I have very thick, poofy hair.?	My hair is really wavy/curly naturally.  When I put mousse in my hair it becomes ringlets, and I do that every other day.  The other days I straighten my hair (I like straight hair better but I just don't have the time always).  However, when my hair is straight it becomes very poofy.  I have a lot of hair and it's very thick so my hair comes out in a triangle sort of.        I was thinking I should get layers in my hair? (my hair is below shoulder length and I'm trying to grow it longer now).  The only thing is is that when I wear my hair curly, will it still look right with layers? and then would I be able to put my hair in a ponytail with layers?

Okay, so yesterday it marked 8 weeks since i got my ears pierced (lobes) so I was excited to take them out over night. I did so and the morning (today) i forgot to put my earrings in again. So all day at school i didnt have any earrings in. When I came home I checked on my ears to make sure they looked all right. I noticed that my left ear lobe's hole looked different then the right lobe. I decided to put back in my earrings becuase I didnt want them to close up. For the right one, I had to kind of push the earring through the back because the back closed up. For my left one though it was a lot harder. I had to clean my ear to make the skin a lil softer, and dipped the earring post in petroleom jelly so it slides in easier. I finally got it but it hurt. Its all red too, just like wen i actually got them pierced. Will I have to do the aftercare process again? Or can i just leave them alone since its been 8 weeks. Please answer! And will my ears be ok? Has anyone done this before?

20090220133203AADUQ5V	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Which dress is cuter?	I have to go to a garden brunch next week, and I like, have to wear a dress. I'm stuck between two, and I honestly don't know which one to wear to the brunch. Any advice would be lovely. =)      Dress 1:  http://www.betseyjohnson.com/store/produ...       I actually already bought that dress about two weeks ago, but I haven't worn it yet. I planned on wearing it for Valentine's day, but ended up wearing another different dress. I'm just worried this dress is too "silly" and whimsical. The garden brunch is gonna be filled with ladies in their 30's and 40's who are all really elegant and classy, and that dress might throw them off...      Dress 2:  http://www.betseyjohnson.com/store/produ...       I like that dress, but is it too plain and boring? It's all white...
