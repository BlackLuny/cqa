213f725a793437432aac3cd6e080d27caa	The criteria for getting approved for a credit card is different than purchasing a car. You and your wife can go and apply for a car loan together. The lender will look at both your scores as well as your combined income v/s debt. They do not simply use an average score of you both, however depending on the lender, it's better to put the one with the higher score first since it can help to get a lower rate. The dealership's Finance Manager should be familiar with this. Good luck and I hope this helps. You can email if you have questions.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	A good Finance Manager at the dealership should be able to evaluate the best route to go.

In terms of getting a car loan together, I don't see a problem in that. You will have to trade in your junker car and have cash in hand as a down payment to get favorable loan terms from the dealer. The more cash down you have the better deal you will get. With the entire U.S. economy officially in the toilet, car dealers are desperate for customers so chances are you will get treated like a king. And they don't want you walking off the lot and going elsewhere.

Ps/ My car once had to do RM800 cost of repair because of a hole that i hit on the main road. the hit cause my radiator to leaked and I didn't notice. then that cause my radiator to dried out and cause the engine stop running.

KQhIcU4Yaa	If you intend to get a bbq, get a gas one.  Force 10, Sea-b-que and Magma make good ones.    More boat people get pressure cookers than crock pots.  Quicker is better than slow.    There are some recipes here:http://www.sailnet.com/forums/hersailnet...    If you search the forum you'll find more.    Some good tips and more: http://www.sailnet.com/forums/cruising-a...|`|nAzbLdBCaa	Chili????? Boating is a lot more than wind and sails...... Several Yacht Clubs sell cookbooks to raise money for projects, but you are correct when you find little to the imagination, and the cook is intimidated by the little stove, but if you think of camping out or picnicking, it's a lot less intimidating........thus taco's and salads, with CHILI!|`|yAGqsrZLaa	First, be careful. If your boat is anywhere there is wave action from any source, things can spill. Good marine stoves are rigged to stay level and have pot holders (clamping devices that keep the pot on the burner). Do some research. There is plenty of info on the web. Second, check for local rules/laws if you are at a dock. Often there are prohibitions against cooking in your cockpit. You have to be down below or on shore.    As for cooking, there are a lot of one pot meal cookbooks. You can use all sorts of portable electric appliances if you have shore power. Usually the problem is storage. Toaster oven, microwave, crockpot, and large-deep electric skillet are versatile. (Again, pay mind to having a solid base.) Make this decision on what you want to eat. On your one burner get a pan or two, with lids, that can do double duty, such as a moderately shallow wide bottom pan. You can make a soup or stew or any stir fry and then use it as a fry pan for burgers or eggs. Go with quality. The environment is tougher than at home. You can get deals at stores that have misc. housewares.     Fuel cost can be an issue. If you do trips away from the dock a small pressure cooker is handy. It cooks faster so less fuel. Cook enough for leftovers tomorrow. Final note, look at cookware as if you will have to clean it, you will. If it has nooks and cranies the crud will find them. Also, avoid long handles unless they are removeable. They get in the way and are hard to store. Loop handles on opposite sides of a pan give you good balance if carrying it with hot food.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	You will need to learn "one pot" meals.  It's not hard to adjust your menus based on the facilities.  BTW, how are you going to power the crockpot?  Don't buy a charcoal habaichi.  Get a propane grill.  They're much safer.    realtor.sailor|`|siHN027laa	I have a 25' seaworthy sailboat. I took out the original liquid alcohol two burner stove as I thought it would be too dangerous.  To cook something I replaced it with a small microwave, a one burner propane camp stove and a BBQ unit which hangs off the aft pulpit. I generally use the microwave in the slip (with shore power) but use the BBQ and cook burner at anchor.  On voyages I use two arge SS thermos' which will hold very hot water for 24 hours. Enroute, and solo, I use them to make instant noodle soup, tea and coffee.  Enroute, I find I really don't eat all that much. Just water, soft drinks, tea, coffee. Small snacks can fill in the munchies.  I generally have the MEAL of the day when finally snuggled down at anchor in a protected hidey hole.  Throw a husk of corn on the BBQ, don't shuck it. Throw on a steak and while that's cookin', make a simple salad (lettuce and tomato), for example.  You don't need a big menu as everything tastes good on the water!!!!  Fair winds.....  sloopy|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	A pressure cooker is great, too.  You can buy mini ones.  Things based on a tin of soup are useful - like a thick vegetable one and throw in whatever you have in the way of meat.  There is a little gadget called a "Diablo" which we have on board for sealed toasted sandwiches, but you can put in sweet fillings, use pastry and fill with pie filling then toast on your hot plate for puddings with packets of instant custard or cream.  Check "Diablo" on the internet - it's a firm in Herfordshire and we found our first one at the National Boat Show & Rally last August. So taken with it we bought another to use at home!  So many things in packets now - the "Look What we Found" range in Waitrose are good, you can buy lamb hocks ready cooked in packets - just reheat, microwave rice stir fries easily.   I usually do a stir fry when we are away - a large packet of ready-prepared veges from Morrisons and a packet of prawns plus a few dollops of Thai sweet chilli sauce and stir in a packet of 3 minutes noodles.  Risotto is easy on a hob.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Ventilate.  A small enclosed galley is a prime place for carbon monoxide.

He spent $1,800.00 on a new transfer case + labor, only to find out there was nothing wrong with the old one. Oh; and the problem? turned out to be a $20.00 bushing.

You will never be able to fix that air system properly.  Even Land Rover admits they dropped the ball on that one.    The Range Rover P38 is a fine vehicle, it just has a bad air system.  Get the coil springs, or fight with the air system forever, it is your choice.    The valve/reservoir thing suggested here is a waste of time.  Anything other than coil springs on a Range Rover is a waste of time and money.  Do it, and be done with it for good, and go enjoy the car as it was meant to be enjoyed.

siHN027laa	The web is full of good, solid Classic Plastics in all price ranges.  Ck some of the marine magazines like Latitude 38, etc. My Cape Dory 25 went from Seattle to Alaska and then down to San Diego. The young fellow sailing it knew what he was doing, though.  I don't know what your budget is but starting searching and researching the boats you both like and make a Short List of the favorite ones. Then start looking in your area for those on sale in your price range.  Even though it's only a foot difference in length, there's usually a lot more room (even standup head room) in a 26' than a 25'.  If I had to do it all over again, I'd get a boat between 28' and 32' in length, encapsulated keel, preferably an inboard diesel (Yanmar, Beta or even a gas Atomic 4 over an engine they don't make anymore (like a Perkins). Choosing a boat is full of compromises so don't think you're going to find one that has everything you want and laid out exactly how you'd want it.   I'd guessimate a good cruiser can be had from $8,000 up and upgrades, repairs, rerigging, etc can be another $8,000 and up depending on the survey (which I definitely would get for any boat I'd buy if it was my first one.)  You sound like a novice so I would definitely get some instruction. First through your local U.S. Coast Guard Auxilary courses for sailing. It's a great organization taught by sailors and the cost is genrally for the instruction materials only. Here you'll learn the fundamentals, regulations and they often will test each student on their on sailboats prior to issuing your certificate (mine did). After that, you can take lessons from a professional or get a boat, refinish her the best you can (and afford) and learn the hard way by just doing it in relatively safe areas before venturing out into the ocean.  Learning from weather forecasts, patterns, predictions, etc is invaluable.  The voyage south, depending on the time of year (all sailing is done in sailing seasons) can be smooth and easy or you could have a variety of treacherous weather to contend with enroute. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise but the ocean can be very nasty at times. Most boats built for ocean voyages (even coastal cruisers) can generally handle the storms, swells, winds. It's the experience of the captain (and crew, if available) that can really determine the outcome. It's not pleasant handling the ship by yourself while your crew is below seasick.  It's something (the voyage) that you shouldn't take lightly and always be prepared for the treacheousness of the sea.  The previous owner of my sailboat told me he would be about 80 miles off shore to stay away from shipping lanes, etc.  Remember, a sailboat too close to shore can be a dangerous thing. Sailboats are much better off where you have room to move without having to fear hitting land. Unlike motorboats, sailboats can't always get away fast enough from land even under power.  Having said that, sailing is probably the most overall relaxing and enjoyment filled vocation a person can do. It's you and Mother Nature.  Sailing at night is totally different but just as enjoyable. When you are away from shorelights, the skies open up and a million stars will be seen. I never try to approach a strange port, harbor or hidey hole at night. Better to lay off until dawn before entering waters you're not familiar with.  There are several books, charts and DVD's showing previous voyages from the Northwest to Southern California and even south to Baja, Mexico.  Many of the sailboats that make the annual Baja HaHa run from San Diego to Cabo San Lucas, Baja, California, come from the Northwest and Canada. You might try locating them on craigslist or through Latitude 38 websire, classifieds, etc. In fact, in March they are having their Crew List available for this years Baja HaHa run.  Good luck..... it'll be a voyage you'll never forget!  Fair winds....  sloopy|`|AA10255553	The distance from Seattle to San Diego is 1211 nautical miles. At 5 knots, you could get there in 10 days, 2 hours, none stop. So figure 12 hours sailing a day, you'd get there in 20 days, with stops each night in between along the way. With more people on board so you could take turns on watch and sail at night, the trip would be shorter.|`|nAzbLdBCaa	You would be very safe in a 25' sailboat, but 28 would be better.  If you look on ebay you can find older 28's for less than $5000.  It's a nice sail of two or three weeks, but I'd recommend making it a summer......sail.  There are a lot of stops along the way , and some spectacular places and views along the way!|`|9l0axvV9aa	For that length of trip, you'll want something comfortable.  I'd say you could do it a boat in the 27-28' range (smaller if you and your bride don't mind giving up some comforts like standing headroom).  You'd be looking at about $15,000 for a boat in halfway decent shape.     From the sounds of your question, you're not an experienced sailor... while it's not rocket science, I would suggest getting *quite* comfortable sailing your new boat before heading on a long-distance cruise like the one you're planning.  Local yacht clubs will usually offer adult learn-to-sail courses.  Call around.    Unlike one of the previous posters, I would suggest an average of more like 50 nautical miles of travel per day for a couple on their honeymoon (that's still a good 8-10 hours on the water per day, rain or shine), and you'll probably spend a day or two sitting in port along the way.  You'd want a couple of months to do this trip.

Here is a guide that will help you set the gain correctly   http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88    You'll need a multi-meter (AC voltmeter, $15 from Radio$hack), Microsoft Excel and a way to burn an audio CD from an MP3.

vGxr9e59aa	You'll need to get a Motorcycle Learner's Permit first.  Your current Class C license will suffice to prove your identity on the permit application.  You'll be issued a licensce after you've held the Learner's Permit for at least six months and passed the California Motorcyclist Safety Program training course (the Basic RiderCourse) administered by the California Highway Patrol, and been issued a completion certificate.  If you wait until you're over 21, you can take a motorcycle driving test in lieu of the Motorcyclist Safety Program training course.    As far as actually learning to ride goes, you should be proficient on a bicycle before attempting to ride a motorcycle. Starting out with a low-powered machine, such as a 125cc-150cc motor scooter, it is entirely possible to teach oneself to ride a motorcycle.  Always wear a helmet with face shield, leather gloves, sturdy leather shoes or boots, and sturdy, abrasion-resistant clothing (leather, Cordura nylon, or similar).  Remember, the first year is usually the most dangerous for novice motorcyclists.|`|mHV6wG2Baa	In the state of California if you are under 21 years old, you need to take a rider training course.

Driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence carries 3-6 points, a discretionary ban and 1,000 maximum fine.    So there'll be a fine, at least 9 points & possibly a ban. That means that she will certainly lose her licence, and there's no point in applying for a test, as any 6 points accrued during the first two years of a licence will mean that the licence is revoked.|`|AA11908567	If it's your "friend", then why do you need to know?|`|0UHI7CoRaa	Insurance issues are usually dealt with by means of a fine 250 should be expected.    However, they usually put points on your licence for driving without insurance. She should expect a large fine, and points to go on the licence starting immediately.     When she passes her test, the points will be there from the word go.    I would advise doing nothing else before going to court except save a bit of cash. If its magistrates cour, be very polite and most importantly honest. Magistrates come down hard on traffic related offences nowadays so a pretty face and a batter of the eyelids wont help her case. Be honest, upfront and regretful and all should pan out ok.    Hope this helps and that the day in court is as stress free as possible|`|KFagjt8Jaa	she will get at least six penalty points for the insurance offence although they could give you up to 9 points if they are feeling vindictive. They will fine her for the no licence but are unlikely to increase the points as it was on the same occasion. The fine is likely to be 200+ with time to pay.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	She has to go to court, and she has to take whatever punishment the judge gives her - it won't be jail time if that's what she's worried about.  You don't say where you live, but I would guess it'll be a fine and a possible suspension on her license - or in her case, she won't be able to get her license for a few months longer.   She can take the test now if she wants - the DMV probably won't know about the ticket until after she goes to court - but she'll probably get it suspended on her court date anyways but at least she can drive in the meantime (as long as she has insurance!).  Be sure she goes to court with a friend, as she won't be able to drive home if they suspend her license.|`|xJWZTwFVaa	Jesus, this isn't good! Well to begin with your friend broke the law, its not legal to drive with no insurance, she will get points on her licence and loose it for a minimum of 12 months and pay the court costs plus a fine relative to the amount she earns. It is not worth booking her practical as she wouldn't hae a licence and when she gets it back, she will have to redo her theory as it will be out of date!|`|GCcQPzD6aa	She will be charged with driving without an appropriate licence and Driving without insurance. Which will almost definitely mean a driving ban for her, will depend on any previous offences and the judge on the day. I wouldnt bother booking her test as she will have licence took off her anyway, better off waiting until ban is up then starting again.|`|7cd3RlqSaa	ur friend deserves everything she gets in court.big fine and maybe lose her license for 2 years.|`|nRzNSAu2aa	probally should have worried about all this BEFORE she got in the car,|`|HVVTyfSgaa	yet another woman using " i am pregnant/having/had a baby " excuse .|`|ym9bT5lmaa	Driving without insurance carries 6 points. Other offences incur more points leading to a probable disqualifation. When the 'new' licence is issued, it will carry all those endorsements for 4 years since date of conviction. There will be fines too.  No good bleating about the circumstances she imposed on herself. The Court will take no interest. Such is the case where someone knowingly commits an offence.|`|AA11903834	did they take the car, i hope so, stupid women

nP92OdBzaa	I'm a mechanic, originally from Europe and my advise would be go with a Honda or Toyota. When I first came here I had a few domestic cars (Ford, Olds...) and they were a freaking nightmare to work on, especially since I didn't have a lot of tools. The Ford had metric and standard bolts mixed all around the engine, so I needed all the tools double. Aside from that, the engine never holds as long as a Honda's.  After that I always have bought Honda's. For you an early 90's Civic or maybe a 88-91CRX (fun to drive and very good on gas) would be a good car. You can find them pretty cheap and they are easy to learn on. The engines hold forever and you can literally take half the car apart with a handful of wrenches (My first CRX had 268'000 miles when I had an accident and my current one has 289'000 with the original engine)  Another important point: stay away from carbureted engines. You won't be able to fix or adjust the carburetor yourself  Also, don't get a Neon. Very unreliable and frankly a piece of crap.|`|H9UjqBJIaa	pick the car you want, then buy a manual for it, that will be the best 80 bucks you will spend on it. it will tell you in detail everything. step-by-step.|`|kati4sOaaa	it depends on whats wrong with the car you get... hondas suck to work on... neons arent very reliable thats why there are so many at junkyards. 500 could buy you a nice older domestic project car... tools for old domestics are cheap and they are much easier to work on. anything from the 70s or earlier is carbureted and would be the simplest choice to fix, and in most cases the cheapest.|`|FQi3bMRLaa	that all depends on whats wrong with the car that you get to fix up. 3rd generation camaro's are a dime a dozen  so are s10's  i'd go that route.. if you have a local pull a part its gonna be cheaper. just dont buy the body from them.  you can prolly get a camaro or s10 for 300..  engines from pull a part are cheap.. 140 for a 4 banger   200 for a v8.. thats with a warranty.. i have done a couple v8 s10's   and its not exactly a walk in the park.. so if i was you i;d go with a s10  and put it back stock

It is relatively easy to work on ( an important consideration if you are looking to work on it yourself ), parts are pretty cheap and easy to find.  It is also economical to run and, considering it is a naturally aspirated 4 cylinder, a good performer as well.  I did see that the one you're looking at is an automatic.  The 3-speed auto takes a heavy toll on performance.  The 5-speed standard is much better.|`|fAYEo76vaa	i had one and they are very unreliabal. why do you think their are so many in the junk yard.|`|jaz7M7Htaa	It is not the worst car on the road, but they are possibly one of the easiest to steal.

wqeAeSVYaa	Insurance fraud is against the law.      Typically, when you call in a claim, your call is recorded.  I think that a change in the details from "my brother hit my car" to "I found it like that" would red flag this claim as a possible fraudulent claim.    Insurance companies do track, pursue and prosecute fraudulent claims.  Do you really think jail time and/or a fine is worth it?|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I never filed an insurance claim before, but I believe it's too late. If your brother has insurance from the same company that you do, then they'll probably raise his rates. What you were trying to do was insurance fraud, saying that you found your car damaged and you filed a claim to have the car repaired under comprehensive coverage (which might have worked if your kept your mouth shut), but instead your car will be repaired under liability coverage from your brother's insurance. These insurance people seem to know how to get the details out of people. You can call and see if you can change your claim details, but they probably wouldn't buy it (they will just see someone trying to protect their brother). If you want to continue lying, you can say your brother was covering for a friend that did the damage and you finally got the truth out of him. The only why I think the insurance will believe you is if you can prove that someone else did the damage, but that will be one lie on top of another.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	You've already given up the info - if they don't go after your brother's insurance, then yours will be charged instead resulting in a higher premium for you.  A generic "i don't know how it got that way" won't help especially after you told them the TRUTH.  Why lie? He should be more careful if he can't afford an increase in his premiums.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Sure you can cancel the claim.  Don't make up a big lie.  Simply tell them you won't be following thru on the claim you reported.  You don't need a reason|`|ym9bT5lmaa	To do as you suggest is fraud! Don't do it. Stick to the truth otherwise there are serious consequences which are criminal.|`|IXtiKaOYaa	1st question;  when you talked to an adjuster, they said, we would like to record this conversation and i need your permission and you said yes.    This is standard in the industry, since you cant state i never said that, since they can  play back the recording.  I learned the hard way, when someone said no, but i did not record and could not verify it.   OK, even if they did not record this, there are standard questions they ask in all claims  1; vehicle  2; driver  3; location  4; facts of loss, how did the damage happen?   5; time of loss, was the police called, etc.    these are things the insurance company can verify.  also when your car is taken to a facility, they verify if the damages match the accident description.    also, they use data bases for other accidents on you, your brother etc to see if their is a pattern.  if they suspect fruad, they have a unit that investigates this.      you can do a couple of things to avoid fraud.  1; call your insurance company and tell them you want to close your claim.  that only works if they did not pay anything for your car.  If they did, cant do, since they will look to your brother or his insurance company for reimbursement for what they paid.   2; even if nothing paid, your insurance may go up in premiums, since some companies increase premiums on claims "filed" even if nothing paid.   Once that phone call is made, depends on the company on their procedures.   Either way, you filed, the info is there and can never be removed;
PFa39j3Uaa	It really depends on the condition.  You know, paint, interior, that sort of thing.  Another thing to watch out for in these cars is how the car was previously treated itself.  Many people climb into a Mustang and mistreat it.  Check tread depth on the tires and listen closely to the transmission when you drive it. A slipping clutch is also an indicator that the car might not be worth it.  Otherwise, seems like a good deal.|`|fAYEo76vaa	if it is a v6 no if it is a v8 maby if it is a cobra defiantly

They are for people to learn on, or for short commuting trips, or for kids to ride around on until they are competent riders.    You'd be a fool to buy a 125 and expect it to be fast.

If your deck will accept CDs but not turn on, then you have unswitched power but no switched power.

You can do this using a simply bulb-type hot wire tester, or a voltmeter.|`|m3L6pLBaaa	double check all your connections. check all your fuses. you might need a test light or volt meter to see if you have power. sounds like either the yellow or read wire has no power going to it.|`|HDK10qYZaa	im not a wizard either but if you just replaced the fuse on the deck check your fuse box under your hood and the one inside your car there is one for the raido and that could be it if not im sure someone here knows more about it.|`|AA10559017	The Yellow Wire is for "Memory".It must have Power at all times.The Red Wire is switched on and off with your Ignition Key.There should also be In Line Fuses to both Wires.If you don't want to splice into any wiring, there is a Plug In Fuse Panel Bridge Kit that will allow you to safely connect directly from your Fuse Panel, available at Auto Parts Stores.And, yes, you'll need a test Light.Find a Connection that has Power all the time for the Yellow Wire, and one that switches on and off with the Ignition Key.Also, make sure you've got a good Ground Connection.Do that by connecting  the Clip of your test Light to the Metal Case of your Radio, and touching the other end of your test light to Power.If it lights up, you've got a good ground.If you can do it, disconnect the Antenna to make sure the outer shield is not serving as a Ground, when you do the Test Light Ground Check.It's best to have the Wiring serve as the Ground.If you've got Power to both Yellow and Red Wires, along with a good Ground, and it still doesn't work, there might be some Anti Theft Code that has to somehow be entered for it to function.For that, you'll need the owner's manual.Also, if it has a removeable face plate, is it properly secured ? It can look like it's on, but it can still be loose.Other than that, I can't think of anything else.Hope this helps !

0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	The question is, natural aspiration or forced air?  Natural Aspiration is cheaper. Forced air can be easier and more powerful.    Cold Air Induction, and Free Flowing Mufflers provide a good start by allowing your car to breathe better. You can add aftermarket Headers and Downpipe that will SERIOUSLY improve your air flow. Remember, your cars air system is like YOUR air system. When you can breathe better, you can run better. When your car breathes better, it runs better.    Performance Cam may actually be the cheapest form of significant horsepower. They start for as low as $100. They extend your piston's motion, allowing for a bigger spark.    Then there's Supercharger, or Turbocharger. But then, you're talking about a lot of money. $2,000 - $5,000.    Rubber! Steet/Drag Radials insure that you're muscle is being translated to the street. And also keep in mind, that if your car is running faster, it will need more brake power to stop it. If you've added a 100 or more horsepower, this is SIGNIFICANT on your braking ability. Don't ignore your brakes.    Whatever you do, I would suggest upgrading your Chip at the end of it all. All these components will run much better if your car's computer maximizes their use electronically. Otherwise, you're not taking full advantage of their ability.     Ok then.

ESY1pBnPaa	Yes, your car has VTEC (no hyphen or H in the name).  The '96-'00 Civic EX's came with the D16Y8, which is a VTEC engine.    Superchargers replace the intake manifold.  A turbocharger is attached to a turbo manifold, which replaces the exhaust manifold (or header).    The 0-60 doesn't sound too bad.  The manual transmission version does it in around 8.6 seconds.  The automatic transmission will certainly slow it down from that.|`|iw2HApUMaa	chek dis out my friend ur car is single cam v-tech may b 1.5 or 1.6 which eva 1 u have and the way to tell if u have v-tech or not is by looking 4 de v-tech solenoid which is green at top located next to distrubitor k. ur other ques about supercharger or turbo first of all turbo is exhaust driven no belt or nothin atached to it and supercharger is belt driven turbo works off exhaust air so its free its doest put any strees onur motor no mechanical action|`|OgvkF5mvaa	yes its Vtec I have a 97 that aint labeled on engine dont worry bout it just look in the front bottom theres a lil green bar and nxt to it theres a flat square it should say D16Y8 thats wat the 96-00 Ex have on them   and for the chrojme piping going to ur intake manifold sounds like a cold air intake or Short ram air  to supercharge ur motor u get a new intake manifold that has a belt that makes it work and for a turbo its ur exhaust manifold(headers) that get changed to a turbo header   We have same car mine is a auto white 97 ex  so for 13 0-60 sounds bout right  and if u want a valve cover that has the vtec symbol u probably can find 1 on ebay

As for  the car is junk.. will take a few thousand dollars to fix most likely.  i would return it to the person who you got it from .. and pry it is not as is .. if so your screwed.. get a lawyer.. and you will have to prove he mislead you on the condition of the car. at the time you bought it .|`|dMKi5UWIaa	Might be helpful to note what kind of car it is.  Check your coolant lines for leaks.  It could be dripping somewhere like the exhaust manifold and evaporating.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Bring it to a shop and have them pressure test it and perform a block test to check the head gasket.    What is the Year, Make, Model?    Edit: If it is the 6 cylinder, take a close look at the intake gasket and see if you see any coolant around it.  Very common motors for intake issues. Almost everyone of them goes bad at around 40K.    Much less expensive repair than a head gasket.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	Is water drops coming out the exhaust pipe when engine is running? How many times have you filled up the radiator so far since you had the over heating problem? Have you filled up when cold, put the cap on, run the engine (parked) with hood open, and observe if the water is for sure not escaping from the exterior of engine? It can only be a couple things, exterior leak from anywhere in system, internal leak entering into crankcase oil or into combustion chamber (which would turn to steam and water drops at exhaust.
BgwTxzEFaa	They would probably have to slot out the struts to do it.  There is no camber adjustment on a VW Jetta.    I looked, I do not see a camber kit for them either.    So, if that is the case, $600 sounds about right.    EDIT: Eibach makes a camber kit.  It is 153.00 (per side) and requires swapping out the ball joint with an offset one.  So yeah, $600 definitely sounds about right in parts and labor.|`|XEKvJzGaaa	Your camber may not even need adjusting. It's how much the wheel tilts in relation to a verticle plane. Your caster is probably not adjustable either, the backward or forward position of the wheels. The most important is toe. I would go with that and see how it drives and how the tires wear. Don't forget to rotate. It makes a huge difference.
36ba3084f158ff6094a5acf141b61ec9aa	Just a thought, have you looked into having the current motor bored out to a slightly larger size? If you do this you won't have to deal with all the other changes you mentioned.|`|VuIxxJvqaa	It can be done, but at the end of the day, I guess you have to ask yourself is it worth it?    The frame's build quality probably won't be able to handle much more power, not only that, you need to take into consideration things like brakes, wheels, bearings, hubs etc. Chinese bikes wheels have been known to fall apart with the stock motors in them, let alone a upgraded one. Plus the forks and suspension wouldn't be of the same quality of a brand name bike. You'd end up with something that you wouldn't be able to ride. The brakes wouldn't stop it, the frame wouldn't handle the motors horsepower and the suspension wouldn't be good enough quality wise to handle the new power.    In the long run, it would probably be better just to buy a brand name bike. By the time you consider the cost of the motor, plus the parts you would need to buy or make to make sure it all fits in, you would have spent at least $500.I bought my 89 XR400 for $1000AUD and it runs perfectly.

9Bw4XCJEaa	If you are talking about your headlight lenses getting dull, (sort of a opaque white) then you have plastic lenses.  I have this on my ford ranger, and they get milky over time.  The best way I have found to clean these up and bring back the brightness of your headlights is to clean them.  Use some polishing compound on the lens.  (Available in any auto parts store for about 2 dollars)  This mild compound will not scratch your lenses, only remove the residue.  After only a few minutes the lens will be like new.  hope this helps.|`|rGJjeiVhaa	You know I have had that problem lots of times in the past and it seems to me that if your headlights are clean and there's no junk on the lenses or inside the housing the maybe a good battery terminal cleaning can fix this problem. If you have time and a few bucks I would go to a service shop for oil changes,or things like that and have them test your battery. It may be time to have your terminals clean and maybe a new battery installed. You're alternator could not be putting out like it should too, but your battery gage or battery light on you dash would probably be a good indicator be being lit up or if it's a gage, reading below 13 or 14 when the vehicle is idling. Any way a shop could tell you all that in about 5 min. And I think cleaning your terminals is a quick, easy and cheap way for a possible fix.|`|abc20da7d47100368c747bf2e1c30876aa	I know it's a long source, but check below (Or you can use www.autogeek and search their site, in case I've made a mistake in copying the site - I am dyslexic!)|`|5Mdy4sSSaa	use a mothers ball, like the one chip foose promotes--it works.
Cytf5LWdaa	Could be a few thing, and what kind of truck it is will greatly affect this. The sequence is probably a cold start sequence to let the glow plugs heat the cylinder heads prior to engine start up. Make sure the clutch is ALL the way down, I don't know how well maintained this truck is so its hard to say what may be normal for it in starting. But, make sure you follow the sequence he told you to before you start it, completely depress the accelerator 1 time real qucik, then hold the pedal just a little down while turning over. Do not hold the starter in the "start" position for more then about 20 seconds. These are gear reduction starters and they can overheat and burn up, and they are NOT cheep. After 20 seconds of turning over, stop and allow about 2 minutes for it to cool before trying again.    Some will have an "ether start" or "cold start" which will inject ethere directly into the air at the intake....DO NOT DO THIS. You are not an expirenced driver or operator and this should ONLY be done by people who know the truck and its engine. if you see a cold start or ether start switch, don't use it.    If you try all this and still have no luck, I'm sure you can find a dealership for rigs like that to ask for help, or a locl company that uses them, ask a driver for advice.|`|5Mdy4sSSaa	depends on what kind truck it is. some have starter buttons. make sure clutch is pushed all way in.|`|0b974c44c4832c6adf69e44a2a906539aa	Sounds like you need to call him on his cell phone. Most diesel engines have glow plugs to warm the fuel before trying to crank it. Usually turning the key the opposite direction from start will turn the glow plugs on. 30 seconds to a minute should be sufficient|`|0ret4zKiaa	Shut the door, turn the key one click, push in the clutch, turn the key to start it.

twgKhCIQaa	Some cars build up a static charge when driven.  Two ways to deal with it.  Install a grounding strap on the car.  Much like used on city buses (look underneath towards the rear) or on cars when being painted.  Or before you get in or out put your keys in your hand and touch the metal surface with the key.  The static charge will still be there but absorbed by the key instead of you.    With practice you can see the spark jump and it becomes second nature.|`|lAyFVzjMaa	Well, wood is a bad conductor of static electricity so maybe  while you open the door, in one hand you should hold some wood.Good Luck!!:)|`|AA12261615	there's really no way you can stop this ,its called static electricity,and its something we have in us,or we generate by wearing certain clothes or shoes,this happens all the tI'me to everyone,i have one pair of shoes that i really like but when i wear them i get shocked every time i get in the car,and out of it,but im not getting rid of my favorite shoes,you just have to get used to it or touch something else that's metal before you touch the car,good luck ,hope this helps.|`|5Mdy4sSSaa	find the shorted wires.|`|0ret4zKiaa	dont touch the car|`|LReKJL4faa	When you touch the door dont touch the "door" entirely, just grip the handle and open it, also maybe you should take your time walking to the car, dont shake your hair up either?|`|1AtTK1FCaa	It's probably caused by the material in the seats and/or the clothes you're wearing.  When you move in the seats you build up static electriclity.  If you touch the car quickly when exiting you probably won't feel a thing.
50bd7be473534d7db07bb37100a4013faa	Practice! You will be scared for awhile. It's perfectly natural and it goes away with experience. The more you do it, (and the more possible scary highway scenarios you face), the less intimidating it becomes. Eventually, you won't think twice about driving on a highway, and you probably won't even notice that you aren't thinking about it anymore :)     I got my license at 17, and even three years later, I still got semi-terrified driving in heavy traffic @ 65-75mph. Then one year, I drove across the country and back, and it got less scary. Every year since, it becomes less and less of a problem.|`|abc20da7d47100368c747bf2e1c30876aa	Take a co-driver with you and get on the highway.  That way, he or she will be able to watch your entries and exits, which are the worst part of highway driving.  Just remember to keep the wheels pointed straight ahead and aimed between the lines and you'll be fine.  Trust me; it just takes practice to really become proficient.  Good luck!|`|HblNpxGraa	Always remember, in most cases people WILL let you on the highway. Not everyone has road rage only the Jack-holes who have nothing better to do. If you have cruise control, set it and stay in the middle lane. Middle lane is easier so you are not in the fast lane and you don't have to let people on and off in the right lane. Be aware of your surroundings. People are pretty nice. Don't look at the highway like it's the world's worst thing. Just think about it as apart of driving. As you get older and more experienced that fear will pass!! Good Luck!!|`|AA10236885	As everyone mentioned: Practice. U know they say "Do what you fear." And have a positive outlook. That's the only way to get over that fear.     Don't think "I can't do it. I will hv an accident". If you think this way, you have already defeated yourself, and that fear sets u back even more. Think "I am positive I will do well. I have the confidence. It is not that hard. I'll do my best." What you think really matters.     I would advise against cruise control for normal day to day city driving, as someone mentioned. With changing traffic conditions on the road, cruise control is not a good idea. U could use that, only on very empty stretches of highway, when there are barely any cars. That's my opinion.    Also, I relate with you coz I have road anxiety too. But I have realized that the longer u have lived in a city, and have become familiar with the roads (like when u are the passenger and eg. someone else is the driver) you feel a bit more comfortable.    By all means, when on the road, be alert and thoughtful, but be confidant. But not over-confidant. Hesitating isn't a good idea. People in other cars want to see you make a move. eg. when u put a left signal, they want to see u move to the left lane, not hesitate. Coz our hesitation can make others confused and mess up their driving.     It also helps to have a calm companion (who wont freak out and will calmly let u drive with suportive comments), or to know the directions beforehand.    You will be good, dont worry! :)|`|05b081a150961a6b42c4453c1b9d419caa	Highway driving is actually in most cases easier than driving in the city. Since you are at a constant speed and there are no stop lights or anything like that. You just need to get in the car and go. The only way to get over the fear is to face it. Get in the car with a friend (its easier with someone else) and drive on the freeway for a few hours. Stay in the middle lane also. good luck.|`|AA10236918	Start at 2am a few times,then try 4:30 am,you will get,but a little scared is ok too.|`|YlkHYgqOaa	Practice. I was scarred and doubted myself on the highway in the beginning also but after a month it was nothing anymore. Also most people arent nice contrary to what someone else said and never think that someone will let u on cause they probably wont

Look into the 2.5rs 2-door models from the late 90's. They are slower than the wrx's but are faster than the current 2.5rs. they look like this:    http://www.dragtimes.com/images/11235-20...    forget about the range rover, it will be too expensive to maintain.|`|A19tIHk6aa	It should be 4-door, 4-cyls, not sporty.

F150 4X4.  2.  Ranger 4X4.  Best selling trucks in their class for ages.  I'm not even gonna list all the reasons but if you want a truck, they set the standard.  For SUVs:  1.  Explorer  2.  Escape  Again, best sellers in their class.  At $13,000, you should be able to get a fairly new model with good miles.|`|VuIxxJvqaa	There is a world of difference between a WRX Wagon and a Range Rover.    One is a performance based wagon and the other one is a big ugly chunk of English unreliable 4WD.    I wouldn't advise you to buy either of the cars you mentioned. You are too inexperienced to drive a turbo performance car for your first car and a Range Rover is expensive to repair, unreliable and big and bulky.    I would lean more towards a Toyota, which are renowned for their reliability, as well as being cheap and easy to maintain and repair. Perhaps a Surf would suit you better.|`|z3u1f4KAaa	just wondering where you got 13k for a car, ur parents? you could get the Audi a4 1.8T or something, they are economical, really really reaalllyyy well made in and out and good performance and AWD|`|4TZsKgAUaa	A Land Rover makes a great first car.  They aren't top heavy at all, they are fun to drive, and even so, they aren't going to get you into too much trouble.  The mere look of them helps avoid tickets, as they just don't look fast.  They aren't exactly fast, actually, but they are still fun on the road.    I'd stick with a Discovery or a Range Rover Classic.  Don't go too new, as things get more complicated to repair.    If you buy a Rover, there are numerous forums that will be there to help you out tinkering, and the money you save can be shoved right back into the car to increase it's performance off road.    At your age, you need a good hobby.  Off roading and exploration is about the best hobby you can get, especially in a Rover.  Great people that aren't bad influences will be there, and will not hesitate to include you in all the fun stuff they are doing.  The community is strong, and a Rover is something that you never grow tired of, you only grow to love it more.    With 13000, I can give you an online club to look in.  The site is a bit finicky lately, as they are changing some things around, but to buy a Land Rover there is no better place.  We take care of our cars, and if someone is selling a junker, we make darn sure everyone knows.  I'd go for a 1997 to 1999 Discovery 1.  Search the forums and you will find precisely what you need to know to buy a Rover.  You will also find the best Rovers on the market for sale there.  Let me know, and I'll send you the site.     With your budget, you can get one heck of a nice machine, one of the best out there, and still have plenty of money left over for fun parts and wheeling trips and special events.    A Subaru is a fine car, but it is a cop magnet and it will encourage bad behavior.  As well, it won't put you in near as good a crowd as a Rover will.  I love Subarus, but I'd not have any of my kids driving them, for that reason.    They reek of boy-racer extravagance, and the police know this.    Rovers are also incredibly safe in collisions.  Nevermind the vehicle safety data that manufacturers pay to get good ratings on.  I've SEEN the results of rover collisions, many times.  I keep tabs on how well they do.  Most of the time, the other vehicle is smashed to bits, and the Rover is simply driven away.    Rovers are plenty reliable, but they do require frequent preventative maintenance.  The cash you save will buy you a decent tool kit as well, and you will learn much about servicing vehicles.  If you don't know how, we will help you.  You will learn soon enough, with the proper help.    A Rover is the PERFECT car for a kid.  They are fun to drive.  I know this, I have owned and driven some cars you wouldn't believe if I told you, and the Rover was always my favorite, on road or off.  They are safe, and that means your parents will love it.  As well, insurance is CHEAPER than many other cars, because of the safety and durability.  On top of all that, they are classy, and nobody minds a ride in a Rover, no matter where you are.    Get the Rover, and get into the culture of exploration, the environment, and join the clubs.  You will never be sorry you did.  As a matter of fact, this can set your life on a very adventurous course.

fZjgIE9Baa	I'm not an airline pilot, but I think I can answer your question    When you start out, you will not get an international route or be flying a larger aircraft (747, a380, etc). You have to work your way up    At first, you may not get the routes you want. The pilots with more seniority get first pick. You may have to work nights, early mornings, holidays, etc. But that's the life of a pilot, and if you can't handle it, maybe it isn't for you    When you first start off, the pay isn't great. Regional pilots make from $15,000-55,000. Once you move up, you can make from $40,000-200,000, depending on the plane you fly and your seniority.    There are some airline pilots in this section (Captain S, Pilot and Mathematician Spaniard) that may be able to answer some of these better|`|DvlwN9kdaa	"The job"?  Which job(s)?

Long distance truck drivers, as in interstate, have different rules to drivers who only drive short distances.    Most truck drivers are required to fill in a log book, which must be produced upon request by an official, there are penalties for not having a log book and also for filling it in incorrectly.

Whether you drive local or over the road, and whether you work for a large company or a small private company. If you drive locally your day is usually between 8 - 12 hours long. If you drive OTR for a large company they will only give you the legal 11 hours driving plus 3 hours on duty for a total of 14 hours a day. If you drive OTR for a small company who is very eager to make as much money as they can to stay in business they will give you more miles as long as you know how to maintain your log book properly for your own sake. Some drivers who want to earn money drive up to 18 hours a day on some days.

Does the wetness only occur when you use the A/C? --> Clogged A/C drain hose, or the catch pan is cracked, damaged and not redirecting water out appropriately.    If the water occurs at all times, then you've got a leaking heater core. The heater core routes radiator fluid into the passenger compartment when you turn on the heater.

Even if its not the floor rotting, you definately want to stop the floor mats from trapping moisture on the floor boards,, rip em out if you have to..

In case your wrench contacts some nearby grounded metal object, if you're wrenching the negative terminal, nothing will happen.  Then, if accidental contact with the vehicle frame or body happens while you're wrenching the positive terminal, nothing can happen if the negative terminal is disconnected from the battery.

AA12179438	You have to drop the aspect ratio of your tire if you go to larger rims. If your car had 17" wheels with 225/45/17 tires, and you go to 18" wheels, your tires will have to be 225/40/18 to keep the rolling diameter the same. If you go too large, increasing the rolling diameter will cause the speedometer to read low. I would suspect if you increase the rolling diameter, you are legally obliged to recalibrate your speedometer (since your odometer reading - the miles on the car - will be low).    Check out tire prices along with rims (tirerack.com is a good place), just to be sure you want to do this. Also keep in mind that larger rims (18" and over) will DECREASE your car's performance and handling, and may require a BBK (which run ~$3000 and up) for safe braking.|`|AA11836753	Yes it will read a lower speed than you are actually travelling.|`|e4150fc7cfb2ccad6c3a37fad9bc0ba4aa	Rims won't really matter if the outside diameter of the tire doesn't change.

Others have two metal clips that are pushed on and are cut off    But my guess is yours is rust seized to the hub and only 2 new rotors and a Big Damn hammer will get it off... usually hitting the area where the pad rides around the rotor to remove it (hince needing the new rotors)|`|AA12244497	i'll back that up, if you don't have screws or clips, hit it hard, try around the hub first, it might save the rotor.|`|AA12023445	check for two screws inserted in the rotor and remove if it has these. its been a while since i have done a contour but i think it has the two screws to hold rotor to the hub assembly

AA10778519	No they hide horns in all kinds of places.  In the fender wells, in front on either side of the radiator behind the front grille.   Just have someone blow the horns and follow the sound to the source.  Horns are also made to blow at different frequencies.  That's way they sound different.    Good Luck|`|ecbe8198deb0b358a12eb8e2bac5062caa	The horn is a mechanical device.  It has a coil in it which vibrates when electric is applied to it and shakes a metal disc, called the diaphragm to make the sound.  If you look in behind your front bumper, or around the radiator in the engine compartment, you should find a round black part, about as big around as a coffee mug with one or two wires coming out of it.  That is the horn.  Have a friend push the horn button and look for where the sound comes from to find it.

You are closer to being correct.  It changed over in 1993.  You didn't say the engine size so I'll go with a 4.6.  Your accumular is the low side.  Look at the metal part of the hoses.

Older vehicles have what is called a flasher fuse. It is usually the bigger fuse on your fuse box located underneath your dash. Also make sure you actually have power going to it as well using a test light.|`|AA11949863	Check the wiring harness at the rear of the box. They are known to corrode and lose conductivity at the plug. Also check to see if you have power at the cab where the harness runs down the frame rail.

AA10778519	If you are smelling gas, then you are most likely leaking it.  Take time to look on top of the intake manifold to see if gas is setting there.  If you can't find it, I strongly recommend taking it to a shop and have them look at it.    Good Luck|`|3d011fedcc6a7184046c28721876daafaa	This happens often, especially if you own an older car. After filling up at the pump station, sometimes the attendant dribbles a little extra petrol around the mouth opening to the gas tank. As you drive these fumes get pushed through the car due to positive air flow. Most likely if you've just filled the tank this is what the cause is and there's no need for alarm. On the other hand, if it's a regular smell, chances are you have a leak in the fuel line somewhere. It's not going to be deadly, and your car won't explode, if you have the ladder, go to a mechanic!     Peace|`|AA11188413	First of all make sure that it's not coming from the car in front of you.     Roll your window down, because the fumes could cause you to pass out.     Pull off to the side of the road.     Start turning off all electrical & the engine.     Put out your cigerette and step out of the vehicle.     Look under the car and see if you can see fuel dripping.     Pop the hood and see if any fuel is being sprayed from a rupture in the fuel line.     Don't get back into the car; until, you are confident that your car   is not leaking fuel.    Have your Mechanic conduct an inspection of your vehicle.    Good Luck! Be careful.|`|4a50f6370c4e17a622592b9eb7a44292aa	look around for a leak|`|f3de1aa2213127b5733553fca2559701aa	those are all good answers, but you might also check to see if the "vent bleed line" has become disconnected or pinched in some way. I had that happen once to my ford sierra.
AA11805116	Cars that run on E-85 are specially calibrated so that the fuel sensors in the engine "sense" the energy level in the fuel. Since E85 cars can run on anything from pure gasoline all the way up to E85, the engine needs to be able to detect the amount of energy in the fuel you're putting in.     The "rubber parts" do not need to be replaced. All newer cars (those built after 1980) can handle ethanol. The only thing you may need to do more often if you put ethanol in an older car is change the fuel filter. Ethanol tends to clean out gunk and make the engine perform better.    I would not recommend converting a car to accept E85 because it could void your manufacturer's warranty.|`|AA11633246	I don't know that you can.  I don't have a link, but a recent (within the last 3 weeks) article was saying how some states are actually offering different levels of Ethanol, like E-10 (which is what we typically use), E-35, E-60 and eventually E-85.  The problem with that though is that the engines aren't ready to take that kind of fuel yet.  The seals, gaskets and rubber components are designed to work with gasoline, and gasoline additives...some of which are absent in E85.  It's also more like alcohol, and alcohol isn't alll that friendly to certain types of rubber.|`|AA10242406	You'll need to pull out anything that's made of rubber between the gas tank and the fuel injectors and replaced with a specialized harden rubber.    And you'll need to get your computer re-calibrated to use Ethanol.    Conversion kits aren't available because typical costs are in the thousands of dollars.|`|AA11194641	I don't think you can and even if you could it would not be worth it. E-85 has virtually no advantages except being made in the USA and it is cheaper but you get worse mileage and diminished performance.

AA11633246	Depends on the class.  8,000 hp Top Fuel funny cars typically swap out the heads after every pass.  You can actually see sparks coming out of the headers during night races as the high heat and pressure shreds any little burrs or imperfections in the engine and they shoot out the exhaust.

bab6789acb82d96b2c5e51e1a3cda2d2aa	It is under the vehicle, about 3 feet in front of the gas tank. In that year, the fuel filter used a rubber line and quick connects. The problem was that the quick connects would rust out. Chrysler offers a repair package for about $30. However, you can get around this by using clamps and rubber fuel line. It's a lot cheaper and does the same job. As for replacing it, every 50-60,000 miles is a good idea.    Chrysler Parts Specialist  18 years experience.|`|27da0bfccbf4934f71f3ed69ef3db46aaa	Couldn't tell you for sure without looking at the van but usually they are under the vehicle could be on either side (drivers or passengers) but usually along the edge toward the rear of the vehicle it would be attached to the fuel lines, pretty easy to take off. Sometimes it will be under the hood. And sometimes they are in the fuel tank, if that's the case if you don't know what your doing i would take it to a mechanic. If it isn't when you do the service make sure the gas cap is off and keys are out of the ignition. Good luck, hope this helps.

You need to see what I'm talkin about.  You could also try replacing the o2 sensor/s.  As they heat up and cool down you can throw a code.

The white sticker shows you the tire size and load rating..    The load rating is just as important as the size..your suspension is tuned to have a particular size and load rated tire..Usually an F150 is 235/70r16..now it could be a P rated(passenger tire) or an LT (light truck tire)..it also gives you info on recommended tire pressure(PSI)..

The last I heard, the hand held units were around $800.00.The question at this point is...What does the relay control?  The answer to this is, or should be, located on the inside of the cover.  This is a Japanese built Dodge so goo ruck!  Just kidding...The electrical system on a Dodge is the absolute WORST thing about them.  Go to NAPA Auto Parts and buy a HAYNES manual for this vehicle.  Do NOT buy Chilton....they cover way too many vehicles in one book, so you don't get the real good information that you desire.  You can pick one up for around $19.00 that will tell you almost anything you need to know about that car.  Most of your NAPA people are ASI certified.

But then, most things are illegal in California if they involve anyone having some kind of fun.  You might want to check on that before you proceed.
AA10242406	Instructions with pictures on location and how to replace can be found here:  http://www.autozone.com/servlet/UiBroker...|`|AA11816854	Just follow the fuel line from the gas tank to your fuel rails on your car. Most cars you can't miss them because they are either right by your gas tank or located adjacent to your pinch weld by your frame. An one more thing in case you didn't already know there is an arrow on the fuel filter itself pointing the direction of fuel flow from your gas tank to your engine. When you take it off put it to your mouth and blow through it with your mouth. If you feel air or gas comes out the other end that means it's not clogged. If you can't detect air or gas isn't coming out then you need to replace it. I know it sounds a little crazy but thats the way you check them. I have worked on transmissions for years and sometimes what people thought was a problem with their trans was just a clogged fuel filter. Hope this helps you out.

AA10242406	To answer if it is necessary to bring it to the Toyota dealership, the answer is no,    However, as pointed out the dealership mechanics typically work on the same type of cars day in and day out, they definitely have more experience with your particular vehicle than any other mechanic. You're paying for that specialist.    Dealerships keep computer records of all your maintenance that was done to a vehicle. If you take it somewhere else, there will be only your paper maintenance records of the services performed.    If you decide to trade the vehicle in the future to the dealership which you've had the work done, typically they will offer you a little more for the vehicle if they have all the service records.    Many of the oils that are used are very specialized. The Toyota/Lexus Transmissions recommend a Type-T trans fluid. Many outside shops have a Dextron III substitute that claims to be compatible, but that Type-T trans fluid just seems so much less viscous.|`|689a44cc7843ed13c2a67e04aa412e43aa	I had an Audi and my 90k maintenance was 1700k.

AA11701494	A Tiptronic transmission can operate just as the common type of automatic transmission, but it also allows the driver to override the automatic mode by moving the shift lever into a second (Tiptronic) shift gate equipped with two spring-loaded positions: "upshift" and "downshift". Once in this gate, the driver takes over most of the shifting decisions ordinarily performed by the transmissions computer, permiting, for example, the delaying of an upshift for increased acceleration or explicitly commanding a downshift to increase the braking effect of the engine. On some cars, the upshift and downshift operations can also be commanded by pushbuttons or rocker switches installed on the steering wheel and a display commonly indicates the current gear selection.|`|AA10242406	I'm assuming you're asking about Tiptronic  Automatic transmission that you can shift manually.

Have a tune up they will normally tell you if you have another problem!|`|AA10778519	When was the last time you had your car tuned up? I would get a tune up first then come back with your question.    Good Luck
cb22a8923b46502f1f842905ea73155daa	What you're suggesting is a  big one-cylinder engine.  Okie doke ... we'll get right on that.|`|AA11235544	well even a 1 cylenderr engine has conecting rods and such i think you are refering to the wankel rotary engine that mazda came out with a few years ago and it was more than 1cylender the design just never caught on|`|AA11748067	buy a moped if you want pure power|`|AA12309487	because most people would not like to drive with such little power. you would probably need a very small car or a very powerful cylinder if you wanted the car to be effective.    with more cylinders, a car can be more useful, especially when hauling large amounts of weight or climbing uphill roads.    one cylinders are basically only useful in motorcycles- like mine,  and possibly go carts and the like.|`|40566b0e49b9be41eed52308b76a339faa	because the torque required to move a vehicle is more than a single engines crank shaft can provide...it would have to be a really small car.|`|651658a6d2d91ec0eb35a770cf68db8daa	I remember the old one cylinder tractors. Those things were AWSOME!  A large flywheel on the side, fires one time and ........wait......fires again.....wait......wait....again. We used to bet whether the tractor would cut off before the farmer could unhook his plow and get back on. Sometimes he WOULD made it, lol.    If the car was geared correctly, the car could work ok on long straight stretches of road, but what would be the object of owning one, other than being unique?   ...jj|`|a1401c1860839fe94da2c074be32e26daa	Because the displacement would have to be large to produce the power required, meaning more vibration and more noise, and it would operate rougher than a balanced in-line 5 or so.  And, the Wankel engine is a completely different, which was mentioned by the "certified mechanic of 15 yrs". Mazda didn't invent it "a few years ago". It's been around since 1937 and was developed by Dr. Felix Wankel from Germany. And it never caught on? Mazda is still making it- the RX-8! They are the best engine in the world, though.
0940c2a4032ad53042c95a2346e4b527aa	pull the transfer case, then the transmission. pulling the engine  would take much longer. it is a hydraullic clutch, make sure you have the flywheel resurfaced, and then you will need a shim to make up for the machining. the machine shop should be able to tell you what size shim. i have been a technician and service advisor at a gm dealership for 16 years.
af59ddd8d214d21940133c0410b9ef37aa	Well i like the answer and there all good... But you will need a long 1/4 drive extension 4-6 inches and a 1/4 wiggler for the intake and exhaust removal...And patience. also make sure you are on   1 TDC and the rotor is pointed to   1 wire on cap before tear down. Sure makes life a little easier....   Good Luck!!!    below is a site that will make this easier to do|`|0940c2a4032ad53042c95a2346e4b527aa	mostly regular tools, metrics. the timing chain  & cover have to come off. so you need, cylinder head gasket, intake & exhaust manifold gaskets, front timing cover gasket, and you should replace front crankshaft seal (it is in cover) once you remove them, the'll leak if not new. check with dealer or parts store, some of the gaskets may come in a kit. the important thing is to check the timimg chain, shoes it rides on and tensioner. if they  are worn, they should be replaced. and make sure the camshafts, chain and crankshaft are timed correctly. you'll definately need a manual for proper proceedures. (i am a GM service advisor and ex-technician, 18 years at a pontiac dealer)|`|e84ec8629942fc418c1bcb9843a7e8b8aa	Regular tools nothing out of the ordinary , not a difficult job but I recomend that you buy the repair manual and read it before you start, also have the head resurfaced before putting it back on. Good Luck!|`|9c625ecc5da36b58b93363a83f96cdcfaa	its a pain 1 tooth off on the cams .and u could have a big problem.i done alot of them|`|46456368c6614809ac60d7a0b55e0270aa	1. If you are not mechanically inclined and have alot of patience don't even try this yourself. 2. Get a Haynes or Chilton Manual for your car (at most auto parts stores and some book stores). These manuals will tell you everything you need to know and what tools you will need. They will cost you about 15-20 dollars. As a little help form someone who has done this on 3 diff. cars have plent of clean rags and thouroughly clean each part as you take it off. It will take a little more time but putting it back together will be alot quicker.  I hope everything works out for you and make sure tocheck the engine block for any cracks once you have made it to the head gasket area (this is important) as you will need a new engine if any of the cylinders are cracked. Good luck.
AA10864701	2002 had some minor wiring and computer problems, you should still be able to set an appointment at the saturn dealership you bought it from or one in your area. and they can take care of it for you at no cost|`|8dcc3ff24016d398ac43b18e7fd994e2aa	Take it back to the Saturn dealership from where you purchased it because it is an obvious mechanical/electrical malfunction.

7a518ac871837a164ec16195e21c84ebaa	ME!  Yeah I know how to fly one of those, but I'm havin' little trouble with the space shutle.  I bought it from NASA recently and they didn't leave any directions.  So I'm just kind of wingin' it for now.  I'm not sure what the little green button does, on the other hand I did figure out what the red one does though (Disengages the booster rockets(The neighbors weren't to happy about that)).  I tried fly'n her around a little, but I haven't broke through the atmosphere yet (usually just take her to the local bar).  Don't worry though I check my O rings before I attempt any flights.  You might want to stay out of the sky on Tuesdays though.  I'm a little typsy come'n home, but that's cause it's really hard to find a designated driver who's willing to fly my POS.  Good luck with that F-18 and don't worry some people just aren't good enough to fly like me!  Keep your chin up and try not to cry too hard!|`|972388d1e785dae6514600697fff7b96aa	heaps its like a black hawke very basic!|`|6077199a037f36a08eec6469a92e0f9aaa	i do it on my copmuter all the time   flight simulators rule

295f409f8146dc33b6b76783f224df41aa	No, it will give way to alternate forms of transportation in large metropolitan areas only. The primary difference in cars themselves will be their source of energy. Once the oil conglomerates have sucked all the money they can out of the remaining fossil fuels, we will see more hydrogen, solar, etc., and guess who is slowly acquiring the major interests in these sources?|`|274a49aa0deb547bee41561712d49d95aa	Not likely. I could see that happening in the Bay area because there is such a great public transit system, same goes for NYC. But most cities lack a great deal of public transportation funding and resources ie L.A. It would be so much better for the environment though!
