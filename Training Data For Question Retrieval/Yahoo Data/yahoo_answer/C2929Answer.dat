Oj1eYTyBaa	1.) When you go green, it is like being Earth friendly. You use less energy, RECYCLE, and use eco-friendly products. <br>  2.) Recycling- you may not always know it but there are tons of things that are thrown away each day that could be recycled.<br>  Reduce uses of energy- if you replace all the light bulbs in the house with energy saving ones, it reduces energy and restores some more in the Earth.(sometimes solar power can sometimes work too.)<br>  Use less water- If you tried to load up as many clothes as you can and wash them in one load, it saves some water and keeps some money in your pocket. But you could also not just do your part for the laundry, taking shorter showers can reduce that as well; turning off the water while brushing teeth, and turning the water off while doing the dishes. (even air drying clothes would be great!)<br>  Take one vegetarian meal a day- If you do this, then it reduces energy use to cook meat. Veggies/fruits can been eaten raw unlike meat.<br>  3.) Because it helps the Earth. Our world is really starting to get polluted by doing everyday things,which we could really just cut some of it down. You could do these everyday things in a better matter for the Earth. We love the Earth don't we? So we should show that we care by going green =]<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that helped.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	It's just another silly fad. If you want to do it, feel free.|`|P6H1HAgvaa	1. going green means to live a more conscience lifestyle in the way you use and do everyday things. It is taking care of the environment and yourself<br>  2. buy natural cleaners, use less electricity by turning of lights, tvs, computers. google how to become green and you will find great lists.<br>  3. people need to care because going green is better for the environment and better for your health.|`|dP8bKNV3aa	1. doing your part to conserve in any way to prolong the effects of all the sh*t we have done to our environment in the past so it doesn't deteriorate into nothing while we'll still here.<br>  2. i recycle bottles and cans and plastic and every 6 months i take it to the recylcing center in my city, i compost egg shells, coffee groungs, peelings and other things to use as soil for plants, i inplug all my outlets (that's just how to save power and energy) i don't use any chemicals on my garden or grass (like weed killer or pesticides) there are tons of things.<br>  3. see answer 1|`|9FNykEAYaa	1.  going green is to changing your ways to help the environment. ex) recycle, use the energy efficient light builds unplug everything that is not being used<br>  2. the stuff i mentioned above, don't use chemicals to clean you house, use reusable bags<br>  3. so global warming does not get worst and the ice stops melting and the polar bears don't die|`|2pROy5Jjaa	Going green is fitting your life style to help the environment<br>  one of the best things to do is RECYCLE. cut down on water use and maybe (if you have the money) get a Hybrid car<br>  people should care about it because your saving your home planet from destruction and making it a healthier and safer place for future generations. You helping to not kill the planet|`|cIYn06PXaa	1.) Going green is when a person or a group of people start being more earth friendly and stop bad habits that may harm the earth. <br>  2.) Households can do simple things to go green like turning of anything electrical, recycle, use things that don't have chemicals in them (they sell these things at wal-mart too). even if its possible you can carpool!<br>  3.) people should care about going to green because if we keep up what we are doing it's probably going to get worse. Before we know it everything is going to slowly die including us. the earth has a lot of things to help each living thing but if we keep up what we are doing slowly our atmosphere is going to dissolve to nothing allowing harmful thing to enter. This is already happening.|`|elSvSt90aa	going green is doing things that will help our planet. in your household you can turn off the water and lights when ever possible. You can also get energy efficient appliances and light bulbs. Also reclycle and use solar energy. People should care about going green because it will help our planet and all the things living in it. Hope this helps answer your question!
2pROy5Jjaa	Hell yeah, we need to throw this thing into overdrive! but it may not happen for a while since everyone is concentrating on money. they just don't realize that we are slowly killing ourselves and see the economy and war as the most important issue WHICH IT"S NOT!<br>  The environment should come first!|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Nope. "Green" living should be a personal decision and not something forced on others. If you want to be an econazi then that's your choice.

UtHnh0aHaa	Facade: First, the panels must obviously face south to gain the most energy at mid day (meridian, when the sun is at it's highest point).<br>  Declination angle: The panels should be angled at an ideal 52 degrees above the horizon so that the maximum flat part of the panel is exposed to the sun at meridian.<br>  For heat: The top part of the panel will be hot and that is where you would have a vent (connect a tube or duct at this point to direct the heat to a place where it will be used or stored).<br>  For cooling: The panel needs to be up high so that the air duct at the bottom of the panel comes from the room where there is cooler air. The hot panel with the top vent open, will draw the cooler air up out of the room (remember, hot air rises) If the room is connected to an earth tube, it will really start to get cool. You can simulate an earth tube for your project by using a metal tube in the shape of a 'U' and placing it in a deep tray filled with ice. Connect with air tube feeding into the room.<br>  <br>  Buy (or borrow) a number of thermometers to show the temperature at every important point in the system (panel air out, panel air in, room air, earth tube air, etc. - just run it and experiment).<br>  <br>  I hope this gives you an idea of how to start.|`|CgogOqOEaa	Send an email to the company you bought this from.

5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	There is no problem with having a fire on snow.   It will melt down to the ground eventually, but the meltwater will just evaporate and not put out your fire, unless done on a lake of course.    I'm not sure what you would consider a bonfire, but collect any type of wood you can to throw on the fire.   Old Christmas trees work great if you can find any around, or lumber ends and branches.   All depends on how big you want it as to where you have it.   I grew up in the woods, so a fire 20 feet tall wasn't any problem, except finding the wood to keep it going.    Maybe a friend has a large yard if you don't?   Wear old clothes to it because sparks can melt a small hole in most clothes and you won't even know it.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Fires on snow are easy if you remember simple physics. However, you had better do it on your own land. Put down a base to keep the fire away from the snow. The base can be logs or plywood or something that is non-flammable. Build the fire on top of that. Light the tinder. The fire will burn upward, not getting to the base until it burns down some. From bae to top, you have layers: ground, snow, base, tinder, main fuel, flames.<br>  <br>  Enjoy. Happy birthday.|`|2uZivThaaa	No park, thats public property and the cops will probably get called because there is a fire in the park and plus most parks close around 10 o'clock. Try your backyard.

Get it started with lighter fluid and make sure you have plently of wood near by so you can keep the fire going. Plus have alot of chairs and seats around so people can sit around the fire. Also have music and drinks (non alcoholic since your 14).

85dd3e1a2e5f17251258499b9309d5a4aa	First off, we can burn hydrogen in a car, but the problem comes from creating hydrogen. When you have a hydrogen vehicle like the honda or your concept car, they require Hydrogen, which is not found naturally. Hydrogen must be made (split from water) through the process of electrolysis.  This is why people say that hydrogen is less efficient than say and electric car, because you have to use energy to split the water molecule to trap the Hydrogen. This process uses alot of energy, in fact it uses more energy than you can get out of the hydrogen when you either burn it or turn it back into water and harness the electricity produced during that reaction.<br>  <br>  Now if you are talking about browns gas (oxy-hydrogen) and adding that to a gasoline engine, this is a different story...|`|E76r5xSxaa	It's not a safe as it should be yet.

Of course there is an environmental cost of hydro and if the dam breaks you're in a bit of trouble but it's the only renewable that actually has a decent share of the electricity generation market.<br>  <br>  Of course it won't help you get off oil without progress in electric vehicles (oil isn't really used for electricity production much these days, nuclear and natural gas replaced it there).<br>  <br>  Geothermal is pretty good where you can use it (Iceland gets a lot of power from it) but it doesn't work in most places.  Wind and Solar for electricity production are pretty much useless without decent energy storage technology (if you have to back them up with simple cycle natural gas then you're going to emit more than just using combined cycle natural gas) and the only one we've got at the moment is pumped hydro which we can't really expand much.<br>  <br>  Biofuels have the problem of causing problems with the food supply, it also turns out that when deforestation is factored in that they contribute to global warming even more than oil from the ground.<br>  <br>  Of the renewables there really isn't anything that can solve the problem, not even together.<br>  <br>  If you want to convert to electricity than any that can produce reliable power can replace oil, coal can do that (with the environmental problems that brings) although nuclear is probably a better bet.<br>  <br>  If you want to make oil then you could convert coal into oil with a bit of heat and some water, the process is pretty nasty from an environmental point of view but it does work, it could be improved by replacing coal burned for heat with another heat source (which would also result in you getting more oil out of the coal you mine for it) and possibly even to use CO2 from the atmosphere as the source for carbon instead of coal (which is pretty much just carbon anyway) which would make it quite good from an environmental point of view.<br>  <br>  You could also manufacture hydrogen either using electrolysis or a thermochemical reaction and use that as fuel for cars.<br>  <br>  For manufacturing fuel like hydrogen or synthetic hydrocarbons the renewables are a bit less useless since intermittent operation could be tolerated (although economics will probably favour getting the heat needed from nuclear).<br>  <br>  The best way to get off oil though may be not to try and just let things happen, a replacement will eventually come along (we've got a few ideas on what we could replace it with) and take over.|`|wXCX0Gy7aa	the new electric space age car

Factories would have to be retooled for new energy sources and workers re-trained in the technology. New waste management businesses would have to be started for alternative fuel by products.<br>  <br>  The energy grid in the U.S. would need new interfaces and switching stations as well as technology upgrades for transfer of energy to homes and businesses. <br>  <br>  We would also have the issue with the workforce, millions of workers would need to be re-trained that support the current energy sources. The old infrastructure would be obsolete and there may be a cost to do something with the old infrastructure.

The companies that would have to change over to support the new technologies would have to do capital investments to transition with little or no incentive to do this massive spending unless the government subsidized the change over costs possibly adding to the deficit and tax burdens.<br>  <br>  There is a cost of change and we don't have a good plan to do it or pay for it.

pBZLTc6kaa	Unplug anything that goes into standby mode when it is turned off.  Things like computers, tvs, dvd players, cable boxes, and anything that has a light on even when it is turned off.  This is especially true for anything that is part of your home entertainment gadgets, as they usually go into stanby mode.  The easiest thing to do is plug all these things into a power strip and then turn the power strip off when not in use.  The average household spents an additional $40 a year on powering electonics in standby mode, not much in the grand scheme of things, but I suppose every bit helps.  Though if you really want to go green, changing your commuting habits, heating consumption, eating less meat, and buying locally grown vegetables has a much bigger net impact on the environment.|`|5TKEtXERaa	Light bulbs don't use standby power so don't worry about those but dvd players, game systems, chargers, tvs, etc. all have phantom loads. watch the video below for an excellent explaination.|`|RtdTxsd7aa	The things you should unplug is the things you usually do not use.

We pay the 5c to the store when we buy it, then get the 5c back when we return it.    If you're bringing in cans from another state where the 5c isn't paid then someone has to make up the difference somewhere.|`|pBZLTc6kaa	Michigan would probably not take a bottle that is only marked NY and ME because of the material.  Each state only gives cash back for bottles of a material that they accept, if the state is not marked on the bottle than the bottle probably contains some materials that are not accepted through the state recycling program.  But more importantly, why would you even drive out of state to recycle?  You can bring your bottles to a local recycling center, it doesn't really make sense economically to drive out of state for 5 cents a bottle.|`|TGSrAzOnaa	If you purchase a bottle in PA that is marked for a deposit in DE you cannot legally exchange it in DE for the deposit. DE is not giving you 5 cents for recycling, at time of purchase a 5 cents charge was added to the price. The 5 cents will be refunded if the bottle is return. Taking a PA bottle to DE and trying to exchange if for cash could result in a criminal arrest and fine.<br>  <br>  No Michigan would not take bottles marked NY or ME.

OcfUTWataa	Look up the Kyoto Treaty signed in 2000, but the USA refused to participate after then-President Clinton helped negotiate it.  That treaty agreed that countries that signed it would reduce their greenhouse emissions to 1990-levels by the year 2010, among other goals. <br>  That treaty expires next year -2010 - and a new one will be negotiated. We, and the rest of the world, hope the next one will be signed by the USA and even China, but we'll see what happens.  It's been in the news this weekend that in 2008 China surpassed the USA in producing greenhouse gases.

You are the victim of an old law that was passed before evidence showed that they don't actually cause harm to the ozone.  It would be a step back for environmentalists to admit they were wrong so I wouldn't expect them to reverse that law anytime for any reason.  It is politics just like global warming is.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	Banning CFC's for medical use is the height of stupidity.  <br>  <br>  CFC's are still readily available in most countries including the US.   <br>  <br>  A quick internet search will turn up hundreds of companies that sell CFC's  literally by the ton.  The number of countries that sign the misguided Montreal protocol becomes less with every renewal.  Meanwhile the UN keeps patting themselves on the back for banning CFC's for medical use.|`|AA11932246	The ozone problem was caused by CFC's which are now banned (there are exceptions which allowed them to be used for medical purposes among others though even those are being stopped) so aerosol sprays (for the most part) won't destroy the ozone layer any more.  The few areas where CFC's and other ozone depleting substances are allowed to still be used aren't really big enough to be a significant source of further damage to the ozone layer (large scale use of CFC's though does damage the ozone layer, despite what a few crackpots may say to the contrary).<br>  <br>  Some of the common replacements for CFC's as propellants aren't necessarily things you'd want to release into the environment (or your body, which is why they aren't used in medical applications) but the amounts given off are too small to be a significant cause of global warming so it's probably not worth worrying too much about the global environmental effects of aerosol sprays these days.|`|CvMkJD7maa	Good question.<br>  <br>  Strangely, aerosols spray cans never had anything to do with the hysteria surrounding the discovery of a thinner ozone layer over the poles.<br>  The people describing the supposed problem used the term aerosols for particles suspended in the atmosphere.<br>  When the crazy ban on CFC's started, people heard the word aerosols and decided it must mean spray cans.  So spray cans were added to the list of banned items.<br>  <br>  Since it is physically impossible for any of the heavy gasses blamed for the "ozone hole" to get that high above the earth, you need not worry.<br>  <br>  The whole "we caused the hole in the ozone" story was fabricated just like the global warming story was.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	No it is a lie .

Once temperatures are below freezing, all you need for snow is precipitation.  You're talking about winter weather, and global warming doesn't make winter weather magically disappear.<br>  <br>  Myth #13: <a href="http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/global-warming-myths" rel="nofollow">http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/global...</a><br>  <br>  2) They're not going to "tax us for breathing" because breathing doesn't contribute to global warming.  When you breathe you're exhaling CO2 that's part of the natural carbon cycle.  When you burn fossil fuels, you release carbon that's been trapped for millions of years.  The problem is that we're adding this new carbon to they system, which ends up accumulating in the atmosphere and increasing the greenhouse effect, causing global warming.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycl...</a><br>  <br>  3) There have been past natural climate changes.   Just because something happened naturally in the past doesn't mean humans can't also cause it.  By that logic, humans can't cause forest fires because they happened before we existed.<br>  <br>  Here is a discussion of the various causes of climate change and how we know humans are currently responsible:<br>  <a href="http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/global-warming-and-climate-change-causes" rel="nofollow">http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/global...</a><br>  <br>  4) People who have actually studied the science are worried about climate change, because the scientific evidence shows that we should be.<br>  <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/03/22/an-introduction-to-global-warming-impacts-hell-and-high-water/" rel="nofollow">http://climateprogress.org/2009/03/22/an...</a>|`|O4hZWdFiaa	it is to make up the days of school that was missed during the snow... but global warming is not very bad yet so going to school when it stares to get warm outside is not going to hurt you.|`|AA11105711	Nobody ever said that a few tenths of a degree difference would give you less snow.|`|rmHP4yjnaa	climate change not global warming|`|gWsBtaUXaa	That has nothing to do with it.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	AGW will cause more extreme weather, that does not just mean planet wide increased temperatures year round.<br>  <br>  Some places will get warmer, others cooler, some will go to both extremes during the year.<br>  <br>  And actually increased global temperatures may lead to more snow due to the air being able to hold more water before it hits cold land.|`|AA11264399	Because a bit of a chilly spell in your part of the world for a few days or weeks doesn't negate decades of global warming over the entire planet.  What you're talking about is weather - natural week-to-week and year-to-year variability, not long-term climate changes over decades and centuries.
bea2c50e30c8c234aeb6e88e02424208aa	Gasses aren't like liquids. Any two gasses, if placed in an enclosed space, will eventually  become completely mixed no matter their relative densities or temperatures. It is true that if you release a volume of carbon dioxide, or some other gas that is heavier than air, it will tend to sink and "pool" at the ground. But even in still air, the cloud of CO2 will quickly diffuse and mix with the surrounding air, and eventually dissipate.<br>  <br>  At room temperature, individual gas molecules move and bounce around at terrific speed, on the order of hundreds of meters per second.  This means that the forces of gravity and buoyancy are not strong enough, in comparison, to prevent two gasses from mixing together. This is true even of very cold gasses.<br>  <br>  Another reason for this is the so called "Second Law of Thermodynamics." This requires that any gasses, once mixed together, cannot become "unmixed", without a substantial amount of energy. For example, by cooling and compressing the mixture into a liquid, and then distilling out the different gasses. Now, we know that the tendency of two or more gasses is to mix with each other, thus once mixed, they will not separate again under normal conditions.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense,<br>  ~Donkey Hotei|`|a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	Relatively heavy means that is would tend to sink if the air wasn't moving. Even on a calm day with little wind, air movement is great enough to negate the very small differences in weight between the various gases in our atmosphere, keeping them mixed together. Also, CO2 doesn't need to reach the upper levels to create a green house effect.|`|7a1a4586cbdfad0a780847164818434aaa	The atmosphere is mixed pretty well by the effects of thermal motion.<br>  <br>  Like water swirling when it is heated, or ashes being carried upward from a fire.

If they all read and act as Morano's proxy puppets, then the effective number of skeptics is reduced from a tiny minority of scientists to a handful of political operatives.  Are the people on the list working independently and then sharing information (which is the norm in science) or are they acting as a distribution network for content from the political level.  <br>  <br>  When I see a scientist like Roy Spencer make elementary errors (ie confusing the Van der Waals size of a molecule with its absorption cross section) in his nominal field of expertise to arrive at incorrect results, I can only conclude that he is not allowing what he knows to be correct to get in the way of a mandated message. Roy might decorate the message a bit with some half truths, but he is basically a messenger.  Although some of the people on the list have the wit to be more than a messenger, that option is lost to them.

Next attention has to be paid to where moving parts meet to make sure that bearings and gears are lubricated.  Generators usually don't require much maintenance but if there is any indication that the power coming from them is irregular then they may also have to be checked for things like broken wires or shorted windings.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes sensors are placed around units that check for anything unusual and then gages can be read and compared to previous readings.

Knee high rubberized waterproof boots and tight knit outer garments do the trick.  Often they are made of rayon or nylon.  The big secret is layers.  Multiple layers of clothing create pockets that trap heat.  If you get too warm you open an outer layer. <br>  <br>  At the depths of winter for someone who works outdoors you might put on the following, long johns, ankle to wrist and neck cotton.  Then a t-shirt and a long sleeve shirt.  One pair of cotton socks and over that one pair of wool socks.  For the head, a ski cap and a scarf.  For the hands gloves and then mittens.  And over all this goes the snow suit, which includes a hood.  This has to be a very tight weave so the wind doesn't get through.<br>  <br>  Keep your head and your feet warm.  Those are the big places where you lose heat.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	igloos or similar shelter is first and foremost.<br>  small family groups cooperating to survive, working together.<br>  usage of animals and materials on hand, eg seal blubber for cooking<br>  and seal meat for food , the skin for clothing and fur from other animals<br>  like arctic foxes or bears.<br>  deep knowledge of their surroundings, keeping safe and obeying one leader.|`|jrcBgCxeaa	Look up Inuit survival skills or artic survival skills. The main staple of the Inuit was the seal. From it you can get meat, its fur is made into parkas (heavy long jackets) or its  be made into a kayaks for fishing. Bones can be made for knifes. Flint can be used to make sharp cutting tools. Fat from whales or seals can be made into oil for lamps.<br>  As mentioned Parkas, mits, and glasses were essential.<br>  Sunglasses not like Ray-Bans but bits of skin or tree bark strip that had a slit cut into it to prevent to much light getting into the retina of the eye causing snow-blindness. The main shelter was the igloo..a dome cut from snow-block that stopped the windchill from killing a person as they slept at night. During the summer months tents from skins are used. Other animals that could be used were musk ox, caribou, artic rabbit. When eating the meat from animals the liver should not be eaten, causes poisoning. Rabbit should only be eaten once a weak because of rabbit starvation. The mode of ancient travel...dog sled.|`|w7q8GUcmaa	furnaces.

The biggest effect is the sun and how it changes.|`|QqM4ohsJaa	You may want to check your thoughts on volcanoes. When we were in Hawaii we went to the Volcanoes National Park. The gasses given off in that place are enough to give you raspy breathing, sore eyes, itchy skin and death (according to several warning signs). The volcanic activities just on this one island (Hawaii) spew more toxic gasses into the air than Los Angeles and New York combined in just one day. Multiply that by the number of active volcanoes around the world and then ask if humans are the real problem.<br>  <br>  Also, think of the times when the dinosaurs and woolly mammoths roamed the earth. They died off due to, in part, global climate changes. Was human kind there for those changes? Not in an active way yet those changes did happen ....... possibly due to natural disasters or happenings.<br>  <br>  Kev|`|hf27zNgdaa	Is Al Gore a natural disaster?

They have it all. Go to the search box and ask your question. They are friendly sites and if you read those two magazines most of your questions would be answered every month. You can read them for free at most libraries.|`|9OHskZrhaa	Geothermal, Nuclear, and Hydro are the major forms of energy that aren't directly from the sun in some way. If by renewable you mean solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal. then the first three are from the sun (direct capture of photons= solar photovoltaic and thermal; harnessing differential heating of the planet = wind; harvesting plants growth with sun, water, and CO2 from the atmosphere) and the last two aren't really (internal heat from the planet = geothermal; gravity=hydro power). Hope that helps!|`|tHvwdev4aa	Okay all sources of energy originate by the sun in one way or other.<br>  Fossil fuels originate from plants that get the energy from the sun originally. Wood energy is obviously sourced from the sun. Solar too. Wind is generated by the change in temperatures which are generated by the sun. Waves are created by the wind which is a result of the sun. Tidal movement relates to the moon but the energy from this would be next to nothing without the wind creating the waves.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion all energy originates from the sun except for Nuclear and perhaps some chemical. Nuclear is sometimes thought to be renewable but the waste products make it not renewable as we have to put the waste somewhere.|`|D3bLcWNsaa	if there solar powered
