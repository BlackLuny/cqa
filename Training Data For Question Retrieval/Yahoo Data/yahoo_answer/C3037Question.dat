20070109113647AANg1Y5	Local Businesses;Germany;Cologne	Mi bicicleta no arranca, que hago?	Ayer me compre una bicicleta marca "Norma" pero no arranca.      No le encuentro ni la bateria ni el arranque ni el switch de encendido, no se donde se le echa la gasolina.      El que me la vendió me aseguro que era todo terreno y tenia 10 velocidades.      No estoy seguro si es manual o automática, tampoco se donde esta el embrague ni el acelerador.      El manual que trajo esta en chino y no lo entiendo.      Estara defectuosa?   Creen que deba devolverla?   Me estafaron?      Saludettes.      Visita esta pagina:    http://cologne.50webs.com       Firma este petitorio:    http://www.petitiononline.com/cologne1/p...
