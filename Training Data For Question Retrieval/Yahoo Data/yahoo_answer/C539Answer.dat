Very, very, very few dentists work on the weekend. Perhaps she can go to a hospital and get some pain medicine until the end of the month. It is the 22nd already after all.

ypHsaG55aa	probabilmente la tua paura è dovuta al fatto di non aver mai provato ad andare da un odontoiatra. Male,avresti capito che è una persona normale e che se ti fa' provare una sensazione di  dolore è solo ed esclusivamenrte per il tuo bene (eccetto qualche "raro" caso di sadismo....  )<br>  cmq ti ricordo che esiste l'anestesia per non sentire male......<br>  ultima cosa piu' aspetti a farti curare,piu' sentirai dolore!!! Dai su affronta le tue paure!!!! ciaociao  :-)|`|09d87ca779a655cde4fe73a0eb35dcdfaa	Io ho paura del dentista e ogni volta che devo farmi curare un dente faccio l'anestesia! Corri!!|`|jQH6brEDaa	L' unica cosa sensata è andare dal dentista perché la situazione non può che peggiorare e te lo dice uno che non ha paura del dentista ma solo un sano TERRORE. Finché la carie è piccola si può togliere facilmente, se aspetti troppo rischi che ti debbano devitalizzare il dente e mettere una capsula. Il mio consiglio è facci al più presto e un con un dentista bravo non senti nessun dolore, per la paura non c'è rimedio, parola di esperto.|`|4549c5ea73fa553d0378e8131dd8bc03aa	anche io avevo paura del dentista e per di più a me i denti anche se molto cariati non facevano male, risultato quando ci sono dovuto andare avevo i denti mal ridotti e ho dovuto spendere un sacco di soldi per poi scoprire che il dentista è il minore dei mali!<br>  Cercane uno che capisca che tu hai paura e VACCI subito!<br>  fidati di uno che ha pagato a caro prezzo la propria stupidità!!!!!|`|4MFEqeoaaa	credime un dentista e molto meno doloroso di un mal de denti , vacci subito|`|w9M7SqKLaa	Hai 2 soluzioni:<br>  1) decidi di andare dal dentista. Ti aggiusterà il dente sotto anestesia e magari eviti ancora la devitalizzazione del dente. In poco tempo e con relativamente poco denaro te la potresti cavare.<br>  <br>  2) decidi di non andare dal dentista. Passeranno giorni forse un paio di mesi e poi inzierà a farti male per davvero, inizierai a prendere antinfiammatori e poi di viene una bella infezione al dente con tanto di ascesso e li dovrai prendere gli antibiotici (considera che in questa fase il dolore è già molto più elevato di quello che senti dal dentista al punto 1). credo che a questo punto sei giù davanti alla porta del dentista ad imprecarlo di farti passare il dolore.<br>  <br>  Se invece, imparando da questa esperienza, tu facessi controlli periodici ogni 6 mesi ma anche 1 anno, quando ti trovano la carie te la aggiustano e non senti nulla. Personalmente, a parte i denti del giudizio che ho dovuto togliere perchè non uscivano e un caso di pulpite (infiammazione alla polpa del dente) circa 1 anno fa non causata da carie, non so cosa sia mal di denti.<br>  <br>  <br>  -------<br>  <br>  Più aspetti e più la probabilità che ti debbano "strappare" il dente aumenta.|`|4qpuoT2Zaa	Ciao x_static_6892!!! :-)<br>  Mi spiace per la tua situazione, spero che queste righe possano in un qualche modo aiutarti.<br>  <br>  Mi sembra di capire che il problema non sia il fatto "se andare dal dentista o meno" ma "come faccio ad affrontare la mia paura del dentista", giusto?<br>  Ecco qualche spunto che magari ti può essere utile:<br>  <br>  1) I dentisti, come tutti gli operatori del campo medico e sanitario, ci sono per affrontare delle malattie che hanno i pazienti e per cercare di prevenirle. Questo spesso non è chiaro, si pensa che il dentista agisca con un certo senso di masochismo o con superficialità verso la percezione del dolore del paziente ma NON E' COSì. <br>  Il dentista, come ogni categoria medica, cerca di aiutare il paziente ad affrontare una malattia o un problema per FARLO STARE MEGLIO.<br>  <br>  2) Per fare questo, purtroppo, il dentista deve ricorrere a dei metodi che sono un po' fastidiosi MA che se preceduti da una corretta procedura di anestesia SI POSSONO PREVENIRE APPIENO. Quindi, se hai paura di sentire male basta che chiedi che ti venga fatta l'anestesia, te la possono fare per ogni tipo di trattamento,.<br>  <br>  3) Molto spesso, quello che mette in ansia il paziente, è anche la percezione di non avere il controllo della situazione, di quello che sta succedendo e delle sensazioni spiacevoli che può sentire improvvisamente...questo solitamente viene evitato da molti dentisti che cercano di spiegare sempre al paziente PRIMA cosa faranno e cosa sentiranno. MA nel caso non lo facciano CHIEDETELO SEMPRE, è un vostro sacrosanto diritto che va rispettato. <br>  <br>  4) Molta ansia e paura derivano dalla strumentazione che viene usata sul paziente, che vista dagli occhi di chi è seduto sulla poltrona sembrano strumenti di tortura. NON è AFFATTO COSì, gli strumenti utilizzati sono ideati con materiali speciali e appositi per essere pratici e poter provocare il meno dolore possibile! Ok non saranno belli da vedere ;-) ma CREDIMI sono estremamente meno invasivi di quanto la gente possa credere.<br>  <br>  Quindi, il mio consiglio finale:<br>  <br>  Dal momento che provi dolore, vai da un dentista e spiegagli la tua situazione, sottolineando chiaramente il fatto che hai paura. <br>  <br>  Tieni presente che PRIMA DI FARTI QUALSIASI COSA lui ti farà una visita di sola osservazione per spiegarti bene cosa hai e POI ti chiederà come vuoi procedere per curare l'infezione.<br>  <br>  Digli di spiegarti bene cosa hai e quali sono le soluzioni migliori, quando avrai deciso basta che gli espliciti che in QUALSIASI CASO vuoi che ti venga fatta l'anestesita e tutto quello che sentirai, a quel punto sarà solo un piccolo pizzicotto per la punturina...che credimi non fa per niente male!<br>  <br>  Dopo ci vorrà solo un po' di pazienza e vedrai che risolverai tutto abbastanza velocemente.<br>  <br>  Ti consiglio di andarci presto,sia per il male sia perchè hai detto di avere delle carie su 2 molari e 2 premolari...il che non è poco! Comunque magari, per i denti che non ti fanno male, sappio che la situazione potrebbe anche risolversi con una semplice seduta di igiene orale. <br>  <br>  Quindi, vacci, PERCHè ne hai bisogno e perchè il dentista vuole la tua salute tanto quanto la vuoi tu.<br>  <br>  Un grossissimo in bocca al lupo, se hai bisogno ancora sono qui!|`|64OGqtVaaa	Uhm...già la sensazione è sempre quella, terrore, ma lo vedi anche tu il dente è da far vedere al dentista che prenderà le giuste decisioni!<br>  <br>  Comunque infondo non c'è nulla di cui aver paura, perchè non senti alcun dolore grazie all'anestesia, anzi come un leggero solletico.<br>  <br>  Te lo posso assicurare perchè ieri sono stato sottoposto ad una operazione: mi hanno tolto un dente del giudizio.<br>  <br>  Post intervento il tutto deve ristabilizzarsi ma tempo un paio di giorni e rimpiangerai di non esserci andato prima!<br>  <br>  Buona fortuna..ciao!|`|B5KlrBe7aa	Prendi subito appuntamento dal dentista e due ore prima di andarci prendi una compressa di Ansiolin per tranquillizzarti, poi corri da lui a farti curare i denti cariati, altrimenti li perdi!!|`|HudJSgkGaa	ti parla una che fino a un po' di tempo fa era nella tua stessa situazione,ovvero avevo un molare cariato da 'trapanare' ^_^...Ma quello di cui avevo piu' paura era la puntura dell'annestesia...Poi pero' ho scoperto che la puntura non fa per niente male perche' prima ti annestetizzano la gengiva con uno spray,e che il trapanamento del dente non lo senti nemmeno,ti giuro!Sembra una cosa mostruosa,ma non lo e'!Quindi coraggio e vai!!!!almeno cosi' ti togli il dolore!|`|i7zEocqbaa	nn ti preokkupare vacci cn molta calma anke a me è capitato 1 volta ti assicuro ke nn fa nemmeno male.....qnd pà mi ha portata dal dentista nn ero affatto spaventata.VACCI cn molta TRANQUILLITA'cia ciaaaaaaaaa!!|`|mEvmPfy3aa	corri dal dentista :*  poi comprati un gelato come i bimbi piccini :) lo facevo anche io:P
0vhsMxIwaa	the best thing I could tell you is to get involved with different hobbies. If you like shopping, go shopping. If you like working out, go work out. Even if you don't like it, still do it ;) Go out have fun. Ride a bike. Remember back when you were young and you never had a worry? Remember how simple things used to make you happy? Take yourself back to simple activities.

Music. For me it was always the best way to cope with depression. Make sure it's something you like, not just random radio crap, that will just stress you further. <br>  <br>  2. Exercise. It releases all kinds of good hormones through the body, and will make you feel better about yourself.<br>  <br>  3. Discipline. Put order into your life, get a hobby, set a goal and follow it. Don't allow yourself to sink into negative moods, deal with your problems if needed first, then move on to what you can really achieve.
AA11512235	i wish i could help u but i just stay really thin|`|OldzWhQiaa	Callie, <br>  You're almost 13, so I wouldn't overdo this. The best thing to do to get in shape is to eat healthy, ( and when I say healthy I mean healthy, cut back on sweets and artificial sugars, eat more fruits and vegetables) and excercise. Ask your parents if you can get a membership at a local gym. (Find a local gym first) you can do push ups, situps, yoga positions (they really do help, you don't need any equipment, maybe just a towel underneath you so you're not uncomfortable on the floor.) and many other techniques. You can go to you're local library and check out some books on physical fitness and also some on yoga and other techniques to lost weight. NEVER go on a starve diet! Ever! Celebs do it and they get MAJOR problems. ( I'm not saying you would, but just to be on the safe side, don't starve yourself, okay?) Eat healthy, exercise and you'll do just fine! If you really want to like your body, get rid of your scale if you have one. Scales lower your self confidence and make you feel bad about yourself. You should feel comfortable with your body, it's yours after all.<br>  Good Luck Callie!|`|Dr5CorKGaa	eat healthy exercise|`|EKwtiKUoaa	dont buy food!!|`|XviRe9Byaa	ok. this website listed below, shows you step-by-step workouts/exercises to lose weight and have a great body! <br>  <br>  its: <a href="http://www.searchforvideo.com/sports/recreation/workout/" rel="nofollow">http://www.searchforvideo.com/sports/rec...</a><br>  <br>  you can also type in youtube.com and write down workout/exercise videos that also shows you step-by-step exercises to do at home and they're simple. <br>  <br>  good luck and i hope i helped u enough

However I'm told in small quantities it's alright, although my logic is that poison is poison and in smaller quantities it just doesn't kill as much.

I used it on my arms because they looked like a hairy ape's arms and it only lasted about 3 maybe 4 days before the hair started prickling back.

d049d1761dc314abfe4d4efd3e65e002aa	La enfermedad pélvica inflamatoria aguda consiste en la infección del útero, trompas de Falopio y estructuras pélvicas adyacentes, no asociadas con cirugía o embarazo. También es conocida como salpingitis. El término enfermedad pélvica inflamatoria (EPI) es impreciso, ya que la inflamación no necesariamente es consecuencia de infección. Debería reemplazarse por terminología más específica como salpingooforitis aguda, piosalpinx con peritonitis pélvica, y absceso tubo-ovárico agudo.<br>  EPIDEMIOLOGIA<br>  En nuestro medio no contamos con cifras confiables sobre la incidencia de EPI ni a nivel nacional ni regional. En los Estados Unidos de Norte América se estima que cada a?o más de un millón de mujeres son tratadas por salpingitis aguda (SA). La incidencia es máxima en adolescentes y mujeres menores de 25 a?os. Esta afección y sus complicaciones son causa de más de 2.5 millones de consultas y más de 150.000 procedimientos quirúrgicos cada a?o. De 18 a 20 de cada 1000 mujeres entre 15 y 24 a?os de edad adquieren salpingitis cada a?o, siendo la SA la causa del 5 al 20% de hospitalizaciones en los servicios de ginecología en USA. Del 8 al 20% de las mujeres no tratadas con infección endocervical por Neisseria gonorrhoeae o Chlamydia trachomatis desarrollaron SA; más del 25% de las pacientes con SA tienen menos de 25 a?os y un 75% son nulíparas. La SA es responsable de aproximadamente el 20% de los casos de infertilidad.<br>  Factores de alto riesgo para EPI <br>    Adolescencia <br>    Menstruación reciente <br>    Múltiples parejas sexuales <br>    Compa?ero sexual con uretritis o ETS asintomática <br>    Episodio previo de EPI o ETS <br>    Inserción reciente de DIU en pacientes con cervicitis <br>  Factores de riesgo disminuido para EPI <br>    Monogamia <br>    Uso de anticonceptivos orales <br>    Métodos de Barrera <br>    Uso de espermicidas <br>  ETIOLOGIA Y PATOGENIA <br>  Microbiología: La mayoría de casos documentados de EPI son causados por C. trachomatis o N. gonorrhoeae. Otras especies bacterianas, incluyendo aerobios y anaerobios, han sido aisladas del endometrio y de las trompas de Falopio (Tabla No. 2).<br>  El canal endocervical y el moco cervical presentan la mejor barrera protectora para el endometrio y tracto genital superior contra infección por la flora vaginal. La infección por C. Trachomatis y N. gonorrhoeae lesiona el canal endocervical alternando estas barreras protectoras, permitiendo así la infección ascendente.<br>  El ascenso de microorganismos ocurre también por pérdida del mecanismo de depuración de las células epiteliales ciliadas tubáricas y uterinas; el da?o del epitelio endocervical permite la invasión por flora vaginal. Experimentalmente se ha comprobado transporte bacteriano entre el endocérvix, el endometrio y las trompas.

Sometimes this can be tough to do as people will question you in a very direct, almost confrontational way.  But you need to tell yourself "I'm someone who eats the RIGHT WAY" and then do it.  <br>  <br>  If you want the best results without stumbling too much, I recommend checking out Precision Nutrition by Dr. John Berardi.  It's not some fad diet and he is a Nutrition Professor at the University of Texas.  It's all about teaching you the right way to eat and not giving you some point system or crazy dieting strategy. It's backed by good science and he even trains professional athletes to get them into tip-top shape.  I have learned how to eat the right way from his plan and have used it both for growing lean tissue (bulking) and losing fat (cutting) by changing my caloric intake and distribution of calories.  <br>  <br>  Some good snack foods: cottage cheese, veggies, fruit, peanut butter, protein shake, plain yogurt with your own fruit added in.  And here's one final tip...sometimes you have to eat some things you don't like if you want to get in better shape.  Not everything I eat is a treat, but it gets me results that keeps me coming back for more.|`|xvhTMwBNaa	Fresh fruits are best. <br>  <br>  Also, make yourself smoothies all you need is a blender, ice and some kind of fruit.

e09df0d530c2edb4d648e02877d0ed18aa	Hi, sorry to hear you are feeling so bad. Anxiety and depression are often interelated - it cetrainly sound like you have depressive thoughts if nothing else. The following steps will eliminate (or at least significantly reduce) your panic attacks and depression:<br>  <br>  1.Breathe properly - if you control your breathing, you control panic. As soon as you notice the signs of anxiety, check your breathing: breathe in slowly through your nose pushing your tummy out (to the count of 5 or so). Breathe out slowly and for a bit longer (to the count of 7 or so) through your mouth. Do not breathe rapidly or shallowly (in the chest area). This will soon restore the balance of oxygen and you will feel a lot better. <br>  <br>  2. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy! CBT is proven to be the most effective thing for panic attacks, mild depression and anxiety etc. It takes a bit of work, but it is super effective. (After 15 years of panic attacks, mine stopped completely). You can speak to your doctor about taking a course or you can take a course for free online at: www.livinglifetothefull.com <br>  <br>  3. Try relaxation exercise tapes (progressive muscular relaxation). They really help if you practise often enough. You can get free downloads online, e.g.  <a href="http://www.studentservices.utas.edu.au/counselling/audio_resources/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.studentservices.utas.edu.au/c...</a><br>  <br>  With each step practise makes perfect. (i.e. practise the steps every day, not just when you are feeling bad). I hope you feel better soon. Best of luck!|`|J0HqcpMnaa	It sounds like you may be bi-polar.  Ask your doctor about it.|`|OldzWhQiaa	Sounds like you are bi-polar. I am too and I take lamictal as well as zoloft. Talk to your doctor about yaking lamictal, but it might work, it's worked for me for many years. You do seem to have depression, but it's nothing to worry about. Your doctor will prescribe some medication to help you, and as long as you take it every day diligently, you'll feel better.<br>  Hope this helps.
AA10133246	Sit ups and crunches do not get rid of belly fat.  All that is doing is making your stomach muscles stronger.  I recommend a strict diet along with some increased cardio.  You want to keep your heart rate up for a min of 15 minutes.  Also try doing your cardio in the AM to burn the stored up fat from overnight vs later after you have eaten.  Then you are only burning what you have consumed.|`|SwP3tE2Uaa	Cut down your sugar intake.<br>  <br>  I am on low carb, low fat, high fibre, high protein and a hour brisk walk 5 times a week, and I have lost 31lbs and gain better health.

If you are not used to this much running, just increase your running time 3-5 minutes each time, until you hit this time line. This means you run 30-45 minutes straight, no walking, no stopping.  it's important to get your heart rate up for this amount of time.  <br>   You don't have to climb hills in your run.  Run around the block, or a track.  Or just go for a run after your workout.  Remember, time is more important than distance, ok? <br>  Also, yes cut the juice to more water. <br>  although you may be doing sit ups, sometimes other exercises also help, such as crunches, reverse crunches, etc. <br>  If you can get a gym membership that may help.  do time on the ellipticals, stair master. <br>  If not, see if someone has a workout station at their home, or join a yoga class.  pilates is another good workout, at least 2 to 3 times a week.  alternate your run/weights with yoga or pilates.  <br>  eat yogurt and milk twice daily with meals, for another boost. <br>  Your friend probably has a different body type, and you can't compare yourself.  you are different make ups, probably.  <br>  good luck!  keep a journal of your workout and what you are eating.  sometimes what helps is eating 5-6 smaller meals a day instead of 3 big ones.  <br>  If you have to eat a big meal, make it breakfast or lunch.  never dinner. <br>  dinner is the least important.  However, be sure to eat something after your workout, like cerreal, banana and milk, a protein shake or smoothie to help your body replace needed nutrients to repair itself. this is important.  You should eat within 45 of your workout.  the sooner, the better, with LOTS of water... this is most important. <br>  good luck!|`|6nlWJXaJaa	Well I am someone who has lost 60 pounds on their own and I was about 190 lbs.  now I'm around 130<br>  <br>  It is very important that you find a diet that works and that you can continue living with. If your diet is not working you might want to rethink everything you’re doing. <br>  <br>  ? Don't skip breakfast - gives you energy to get through the day and fills you up so you're not as hungry for the rest of the day.<br>  ? drink lots of water preferably 3-4 bottles (force it down if you have to) - it cleans out your body and fills you up so you don't eat too much<br>  ? pick one day during the week and don't eat anything for that one day but drink a lot of water to fill yourself up and kill the cravings<br>  ? keep far away from sweets and high calorie foods (of course you can let yourself eat some sweets once in a while, like once a week, but thats it)<br>  ? when exercising don't over do it and leave a day of rest you just allow your muscles to develop further<br>  ? over-exercising may cause you to even gain weight and I don't means muscle plus it may cause th reverse and you will even lose muscle<br>  ? drink as little juice as possible because that's the calorie bomb and that's what may have you thinking why am I not losing weight - oh I've been drinking too much juice<br>  ? on days you don't eat you may definitely want to make up the lost calories and energy by drinking juice to replace food because you don’t want to suddenly black out because you don’t have any energy<br>  ? (don't starve yourself because remember its just one day a week - I did it on friday)<br>  ? don't eat after 6 or 7 pm to let you're body rest from the food intake (you know how you feel bad after eating something right before you go to sleep there you go) trust me I know so many people that have lost tremendous amounts of weight doing this and they have learned to live with it<br>  ? it is important to stay motivated - what or who are you doing this for well for the most part the answer should be - for yourself, because you're the on that wants to be healthy and you're the one that wants to have the great body. <br>  ? I workout at home and I have a bench that can be used with dumbbells and you can change the height, I also you it for ab exercises on the lowest setting, cost me about $40 - a lot less than the others<br>  ? I also have a weight bar and leg attachments for my chest, arms and legs<br>  -and when it comes to exersicing you don't want to do the same thing everyday because you WILL get bored which makes you more likely to quit<br>  <br>  Well good luck!|`|YVeKnIj5aa	To successfully lose weight, you must carry out<br>  a plan to balance your caloric intake with exercise.<br>  Ideally, dieting should be done by eating a nutritionally<br>  balanced, low-calorie diet and increasing physical activity. <br>  I found useful informations at|`|U8LrWSS9aa	My field is in fashion, as a result many people ask me how they can slim down.

Nobody knows why this is the case, and depression itself certainly can also reduce the desire for sex.  If the latter is the case, once the mood is normalized (often with medication, sometimes with therapy but usually with both) the desire returns. <br>  If the medication is the cause, the person should talk with the doctor who prescribed  the antidepressant to see if there might be another alternative that might not have this side effect.  If the antidepressant was prescribed by a general practitioner, a psychiatrist (not a therapist) who specializes in this type of medication might be able to fine tune the medications. Therapists and psychologists usually do counselling, psychiatrists are MD's specially trained to work with mental health related medications.

You have to be focused or you can actually put on weight.  Try to eat mostly green vegetables and low to no fat.  This means no fast food hamburgers, chicken etc, there is lots of hidden fat and be sure to drink lots of water.  Start your day with oatmeal, no milk and don't add sugar, try raisins to get a sweet bite.  Eat 1/2 fruit at 10:00 and salad w/ lemon for lunch.  If you have to add meat go lean 1/2 cup turkey, chicken or tuna on salad.  Other 1/2 fruit at 3:00 and dinner at 6:00 with more green veggies.  Eat 1/2 of what you normally do.  Eat on a smaller plate and be aware of what you put in your mouth.  Do not eat watching tv, savor eat bite, then clear the table and stove.  Do not eat after 7:00.  Warm no caf tea if you feel hungry after this time.  Weigh every day because its easier to lose 1 lb than 10 lbs and if you see it you will focus harder.  Everytime you get hungry, exercise.  If you feel faint eat 1/2 fruit up to 1 hour before scheduled meal.  You should do this for 7 days then take a day off, but be sure not to over eat, just eat that thing you have put off, then start the next day for 7 more.|`|0vJDg59uaa	drink lots of water! that helps you to keep filled in between meals. eat things like carrots, celery, apples, cantaloupe, cucumber, broccli (sp?), oranges, and grape fruit. they are supposed to be low in calories, and they take more energy to digest so you lose calories. (ex: an apple has 20 cal. you burn 30 cal. digesting it.) do some form of excercise every single day! whether its gardening, swimming, or jogging its excercise! dont over eat. eat until your full then stop. if you get hungry inbetween meals drink water or eat a fruit/vegetable. cut back on soda and sweets and no fast food. dont cook fried chicken (or any other fried food) boil or grill it instead. well thats all i can really think of. i hope this helps you!! good luck! =)|`|65V1uy1oaa	And why do you NEED to lose 13 pounds in less than 20 days?  There is no healthy way to do it.  If you do manage it, your last few pounds will be lost in the hospital.  Maybe you need to think about being healthly all the time, and not just for special occasions.|`|V4JnHdOtaa	every lb of fat = 3000 calories.  reducing 3000 cal from your diet will lose you 1 lb.  you need to figure your caloric need.  use an on-line calculator.  you will enter your activity level, weight, height, build, etc.  So if your daily requirement to remain at your current weight is 3500 cal, you will lose a lb every 2 days if you reduce your diet by 1500 cals. as you lose weight your daily caloric intake lowers.  no-carb diets are horrible for your system.  for a fast weight loss, i recommend eating 3 small portioned meals approx 400 cals a piece and vegetables w/o dressing/dip whenever you are hungry.  ground chicken, roasted red peppers, brown rice and spaghetti sauce mixed together, provides a good base that won't leave you starving.  look for complex carbohydrates like brown rice, it will help you lose weight.  most importantly eat throughout the day.  the body shuts down if you try to starve yourself.

It helped my body heal and now I have turned pretty much back to normal. At first it can be painful, so stay on top of pain meds. But after a while you get used to the plate and ignore it. I'm sure if you need one your doctor will tell you more about your specific procedure.  Good luck!

V66YUXL7aa	Down's Syndrome can be found in Asians, I have seen 3 cases.<br>  I don't know about achondroplasia in blacks, but I think it may be prevalent in them.<br>  Although certain diseases are more common in certain races, they may be found in other races as well. It's sort of globalization!|`|9TjwsH7waa	Though there are no  racial factors there are other factors that have influence on expression of these conditions.<br>  <br>  Advanced maternal age is a definite risk factor for contracting Trisomy 21, or Downs Syndrome.  Just FYI,  this is one condition why while receiving pre-natal a pregnant woman will receive a triple screen at 18 weeks gestational age.  Down syndrome occurs in about one in every 800 to 1,000 births. It affects an equal number of boys and girls. Less than 25 percent of Down syndrome cases occur due to an extra chromosome in the sperm cell. The majority of cases of Down syndrome occur due to an extra chromosome 21 within the egg cell supplied by the mother. As a woman's age (maternal age) increases, the risk of having a Down syndrome baby increases significantly. For example, at younger ages, the risk is about one in 4,000. By the time the woman is age 35, the risk increases to one in 400; by age 40 the risk increases to one in 110; and by age 45 the risk becomes one in 35. <br>  <br>  With Achondroplasia, advanced paternal age is a significant risk factor.  It is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3.  There is no difference in distribution between race, sex and it occurs one time in every 40,000 live births.
9cMLrNOkaa	30 minutes of cardio is a MUST for weight loss. So run half an hour in the morning. Also you can do some excercises on a bowflex to tighten up your muscles but not get built, so don't over do it. Breakfast you can eat an egg scrambled with cheese or even an omlette. Instead of fast food how about the night before you pack a salad, some nuts, and an apple for lunch sp you won't need fast food. Also you can bring healthy things with you to snack on examples; carrots, celery, one 100 calorie pack would be great. For dinner you can make your own wrap with cooked meat, cheese, lettuce, and a little bit of salsa. It isn't hard. You just have to work for it like everyone else. I'm glad to see your trying to do it healthy and your metabolism will speed up. You will fit the right way back in those jeans in no time! Also if you cheat one day don't let it bum you out. Just work harder the next and don't make it a habit. Good luck! Ps. Good job on being a great mom. I know some mothers who care more about working out then their children and it is sad.

Ahora, como es difícil que un médico en esta ciudad (México), atienda un caso por gusto estético, te comentaré: existen varios remedios, pero todos con su consabida duda: <br>  <br>  a) levadura de cerveza: en las tiendas naturistas busca algún producto que tenga esto y albúmina de huevo. Estos ayudan a que el múscul engrose naturalmente. Los encuentras como polvos o suplementos alimenticios (van desde los 70 a 900 pesos).<br>  <br>  b) esteroides: pero, estos son importante que los manejes con cuidado, pues tienen reacciones secundarias, todas fuertes.

See that you eat enough fiber to keep your stomach soft. Stay away from milk but drink plenty of fluid in general. If you feel you need to go - then go. Don't hold it back - it will cause the stool to get more hard if it stays too long inside. <br>  After a restroom visits make sure that you clean your self up good - swiping with paper is not enough. Wash your self or buy special swipes for hemorrhoids. You might want to supplement with a special lotion that will take the pain and make the hemorrhoid shrink. Another help is taking a hand shower and shower your behind with cold water while you attempt to press it in again. Good luck and don't forget that a lot of people had that problem at one or another point. You just need to find a way to deal with it and it will diminish as to where it is not a problem.
pQTceAiaaa	Masturbate all night until you fall asleep...|`|j3Zgo8heaa	1. Every night, half an hour before retiring, go to your room, where you can be entirely alone & as remote as possible from noise and distraction. 2. Seat yourself in a wide & comfortable chair, or, better still, lie down on your back at full length. See that your clothing is loosened, so that you will suffer no distressing annoyance on this account. Compose yourself as if for sleep, assuming a position of restfulness, abandon & utter relaxation. Close your eyes, letting the lids rest lightly on your cheeks. 3. Shut your mind resolutely against every form of bodily sensation. Forget for the time that you are encumbered with a body. 4. Bar out of your consciousness every memory, every thought of the past. 5. Build a mental picture of the thing you want to have, to do or to be – the one thing that you immediately desire first & most of all. By this we mean nothing indefinite. We do not refer to ultimate aims that can come only as the result of long periods of effort. We mean something specific, something that can be yours tomorrow, something that in itself constitutes the next step in your chosen career. 6. See yourself finding the ways and means of realizing your desire, overcoming obstacles one after another, all the obstacles that can possibly arise. See yourself called upon to display, & displaying, alertness, promptness, courage, confidence, resourcefulness, patience, push, enterprise, expert knowledge, insight, shrewdness, tact, self-control, decision. See yourself face to face with the situation that confronts you in real life and manifesting the qualities & doing the things necessary to your purpose. Put yourself body & soul into this picture. Multiply details. Rivet your mind upon it. 7. Advance step by step, logically, wisely, consistently, to the climax of the drama. See yourself winning out. See yourself solving the problem, getting the thing you want, acting the part you desire to play. Detach your spirit from the flesh of this world & incorporate it in the mental image of yourself. Live the victory mentally until a sense of its reality permeates your soul. 8. Make your dream picture as delightful as possible. Dwell upon it with joyful satisfaction. Warm your heart with a feeling of thankfulness that that which you have so long desired is really yours. This feeling of gratitude, this emotional element, will bring forth associations that will give life to the picture & will animate your faith. Keep yourself tight shut in this dream world for at least fifteen minutes. 9. Arise and make your preparations for the night. Then upon retiring once more close your eyes & let your mind dwell upon your vision for five or ten minutes or until you fall asleep. Let it be the last thing in your thoughts as you become unconscious. 10. Every time you are awake during the night call the mental picture before you & keep it in consciousness as long as you remain awake. 11. In the morning, immediately upon awaking, repeat the procedure set out in the third, fourth and fifth instructions. 12. The more of your spare time you spend in this way, the more promptly will you actualize your ideals. By repeated concentration, every detail of the image of your desire will be so deeply engraved upon your mind as to exert an influence throughout the day. It will inhibit wasteful emotions and impulses. It will give you poise and self-possession. It will so inspire you with its promise as to awaken an energizing response in the profoundest depths of your subconsciousness.<br>  <br>  I'm wishing you well and sending love your way.

pANLrV3raa	The first thing you need to know is that your kidneys need plenty of water to function in your body.  If your kidneys don't have enough water to function properly then the liver must take over some of that responsibility.  This is where the losing weight part comes in.  If the liver has to help the kidneys it can't focus on one of its main functions which is to metabolize fat.   Therefore drink lots of water, keep those kidneys functioning and keep your liver breaking down the fat.|`|951483cfb9daff8f4880ea125371effbaa	WOW, I just saw the book above me.......<br>  I thought it was to make you run back and forth to the bathroom so much you had to lose weight!!|`|NPCgAjNsaa	Don't roll your eyes! The potion for losing that excess body fat is all around you. It covers two thirds of the planet. If you eat right and exercise at the intensity, frequency and duration proper for you, but still can't get rid of a little paunch here and there, you're probably just not drinking enough water. <br>  <br>  No need to get defensive. You're actually quite normal. Most people don't drink enough water. Most people are also carrying around a few more pounds than they would be if they did drink enough water. If you can't seem to get that weight off, try drowning your sorrows in nature's magical weight-loss mineral. It works, and here's why: <br>  <br>  "What on Earth is 'metabolism', anyway?" People use the term all the time, but ask them what it means and you'll get all kinds of answers. Merriam Webster defines it as, "The process by which a substance is handled in the body." A little vague, but that's really all it means. <br>    <br>  There are many forms of metabolism going on in your body right now, but the one everyone is talking about it the metabolism of fat. This is actually something that the liver does when it converts stored fat to energy. The liver has other functions, but this is one of its main jobs. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, another of the liver's duties is to pick up the slack for the kidneys, which need plenty of water to work properly. If the kidneys are water-deprived, the liver has to do their work along with its own, lowering its total productivity. It then can't metabolize fat as quickly or efficiently as it could when the kidneys were pulling their own weight. If you allow this to happen, not only are you being unfair to your liver, but you're also setting yourself up to store fat. <br>  <br>  "I've tried it and I couldn't stand it!" The problem is that, though many decide to increase their water intake, very few stick with it. It's understandable. During the first few days of drinking more water than your body is accustomed to, you're running to the bathroom constantly. This can be very discouraging, and it can certainly interfere with an otherwise normal day at work. It seems that the water is coming out just as fast as it's going in, and many people decide that their new hydration habit is fruitless. <br>  <br>  Do take heed , though. What is really happening is that your body is flushing itself of the water it has been storing throughout all those years of "survival mode". It takes a while, but this is a beautiful thing happening to you. As you continue to give your body all the water it could ask for, it gets rid of what it doesn't need. It gets rid of the water it was holding onto in your ankles and your hips and thighs, maybe even around your belly. You are excreting much more than you realize. Your body figures it doesn't need to save these stores anymore; it's trusting that the water will keep coming, and if it does, eventually, the flushing (of both the body and the potty) will cease, allowing the human to return to a normal life. It's true. This is called the "breakthrough point." <br>  <br>  One recent finding, as irresponsible as it may be, that caffeine increases the body's fat-burning potential has many people loading up on coffee before going to the gym. This finding may hold some degree of truth in it, but caffeine is, in essence, a diuretic, and diuretics dehydrate. Caffeine may increase the heart rate, causing a few more calories to be burned, but this is at the expense of the muscles, which need water to function properly. This isn't doing your heart any favors, either. It's already working hard enough during your workout. Never mix caffeine and exercise. In fact, your best bet is to stay away from caffeine all together. It's a big bully that pushes your friend water out of your system. <br>  <br>  Water is the best beauty treatment. You've heard this since high school, and it's true. Water will do wonders for your looks! It flushes out impurities in your skin, leaving you with a clear, glowing complexion. It also makes your skin look younger. Skin that is becoming saggy, either due to aging or weight loss, plumps up very nicely when the skin cells are hydrated. <br>  <br>  In addition, it improves muscle tone. You can lift weights until you're blue in the face, but if your muscles are suffering from a drought, you won't notice a pleasant difference in your appearance. Muscles that have all the water they need contract more easily, making your workout more effective, and you'll look much nicer than if you had flabby muscles under sagging skin. <br>  <br>  "Eight glasses a day? Are you kidding?!" It's really not that much. Eight 8-ounce glasses amount to about two quarts of water. This is okay for the average person, but if you're overweight, you should drink another eight ounces for every 25 pounds of excess weight you carry. You should also up this if you live in a hot climate or exercise very intensely.<br>  <br>  This water consumption should be spread out throughout the day. It's not healthy at all to drink too much water at one time. Try to pick three or four times a day when you can have a big glass of water, and then sip in between. Don't let yourself get thirsty. If you feel thirsty, you're already becoming dehydrated. Drink when you're not thirsty yet. <br>  <br>  Do you think water is yucky? Drinking other fluids will certainly help hydrate your body, but the extra calories, sugar, additives and whatever else aren't what you need. Try a slice of lemon or lime in the glass, or if you really think you hate water, try a flavored water. Just make sure you read the labels. Remember that you're going to be consuming a lot of this fluid. <br>  <br>  It's probably a good idea to stop drinking water a good three hours before you go to bed. You know why. <br>  <br>  "How cold should it be?" This is debatable. Most experts lean toward cold water, because the stomach absorbs it more quickly. There is also some evidence that cold water might enhance fat burning. <br>  On the other hand, warmer water is easier to drink in large quantities, and you might drink more of it without even realizing it. Do whatever suits you, here. Just drink it! <br>  <br>  When you drink all the water you need, you will very quickly notice a decrease in your appetite, possibly even on the first day!

5MX1Itumaa	If your arm/leg is turning red and / or swollen, you might worrry about it. IF I WERE YOU, I'd take some some anti-inflamatory drugs, (Motrin or naproxyn) for a bit first  say 4 days.  Probably have some real deep hellaous bruises that need to heal. If swollen and or red, then could have something more serious and need xrays and maybe an ultrasound.<br>  But if your frightened then by all means...ease your mind and go see you FAMILY DOCTOR.  An Ortho or Neuro doc are expensive, hard to get into, and if needed your family doc can get you a quick appointment.|`|uC75y83Taa	You were in a BIG accident.  Yes!  Get to a doctor tomorrow.  Good luck, hon.  :)|`|AA11446286	Yes please consult a Orthopedian doctor and Neuromuscular doctor.|`|dQYEbXANaa	Absolutely. I have been an x ray tech for 24 years. One thing I have learned is that not all injuries manifest right away.  If you are having increased pain  that lasts for longer periods of time you need to be seen. There may be an injury that was not apparent at the time of the accident.
jR5kvXgeaa	there are no magic diet pills/patches/teas/lotions - weight loss is hard work.<br>  find daily calorie intake calculator on the net, enter all your stats and it will tell you how many calories you need a day to maintain, take off 300-400cal off that number and thats how much you need to lose.<br>  eat 5-6 small meals a day (eat every 2-3 hours - it optimizes your metabolism)<br>  5-8 servings of fruit and veggies a day<br>  8 glasses of water<br>  have complex carbs for breakfast - they give you energy<br>  have protein (lean meat, legumes etc) for dinner - repairs muscle<br>  cardio is the only fat burning exercise and burns fat all over your body (running, jogging, swimming, spinning, elliptical etc) 4-6 times a week for 30-50min (ideally 45min because the first 20-30min body burns carbs and only then starts burning fat), weight training a few days a week but never work on the same muscle group two days in a row (more muscle=faster metabolism)<br>  dont consume foods that are made of white flour (white bread, cakes, pasta etc.), sugar loaded foods (cookies, icecream, candy etc) and nothing fried, oily.<br>  ofcourse you can spoil yourself once in a while with a little treat:)|`|bVkIEpyGaa	Try and eat foods with less than 4% fat in them. It's very easy to do, without restricting you too much. Best of all, theres no weighing or calorie counting. Throw in 10 minutes of exercise a couple of times a day (anything - dancing, walking, swimming..) as early as possible to get the metabolism going. Set realistic goals for your weight loss (half a stone a month is mine) and reward yourself (new hairdo or perfume) when you reach your goals. And congratulations on your beautiful babies. I'm so jealous! <br>  <br>  The person above gives some good advice, but i was kind of thinking about a simple diet because of how busy you must be taking care of two babies. I forgot to mention also that if you include some calcium in your diet, it helps fat to pass through your body unabsorbed. Also try and eat a third carbs (pasta, rice, bread etc) and a third protein (white meats and fish, cottage cheese...) and a third fruit and veg. Carbs fill you up but burn off pretty fast, but protein actually keeps you feeling full for longer.

YTyZXu9zaa	Yes, you probably need to see a proper Gyno, maybe just for a second opinion as your GP is stumped, but there are probably also restrictions on who can order the tests you need. First off, they need to check your ferritin and do a full blood-count (if they haven't already). Next, they need to do a hormone serum, checking blood levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. It's probably something funky with your hormones. An alternative is to try a hormone supplement (like the pill) for a few months to see if that will sort the problem out. That said, there's nothing medically wrong with not menstruating (ie, it is unlikely to cause your body any harm), but if you have previously had regular menses, this is something that should be checked out thoroughly.|`|1CDp1uStaa	Definately go see your Gyn... It could definately be your hormones. Also, it could have something to do with your thyroid. To have PCOS you don't have to have the typical "cystic ovaries"... but as the previous poster said, The proper panel to check for hormone flucations needs to be done. Good luck!!!
dsBCGbWpaa	Don't worry, honey. Everyone's body is different. While the 1st thru 4th periods tend to be very light, some girls may start out heavy. Also, periods are supposed to last between 5-7 days so you're completely normal! Best of luck!|`|uC75y83Taa	As long as it's bright red blood, (not brownish,) that IS your period.   It will slow down by day 5 and will probably linger on till day 7.  Nothing to be scared about!!  Totally normal.  You are now a woman!!  lol  :)|`|cfdaafe195dbe3394c7aba2b49ed9576aa	Yep, totally normal!  It is often light, but not always.  The normal length of a period - once established - is about 5 days.  The first year or so, yours will likely vary greatly, both in how often it comes and how often, don't worry, that's normal!  <br>  <br>  If you're soaking through a pad an hour or more, talk to your mom or dad about seeing the doctor - that would be unusually heavy.  But if you're just having a moderate amount of bleeding over several days, it's fine.|`|2639d75e32b2400f586ab9ba91769bf4aa	Yes it is normal, im 14 too, had mine for about a year and a half. My first was not too heavy but not light either. You will have your period once a month usually around the same date each month for 3-7 days.|`|scUJx41naa	Every girl is different. When i first started it was heavy and i bled for the normal 7 days. Some people will be heavy and others will be light. 14 is the average age that girls start menstruating. It is very likely that it is your first period. Just monitor it for the next four days and if it stops then you are fine. If you keep bleeding, I would talk to your doctor but from what you have said, it sounds like you are a normal girl.
GkKOpaGNaa	No, I've done that before just so I could feel better and get rid of the nausea. Some people do it when they've been drinking... as long as you aren't making it a daily routine then I think you're fine.|`|AA11665041	Sounds to me like you were just dealing with a bad stomach and you wanted relief. Just try to keep an eye on what your eating and how much your eating. If you get use to this behavior then you will be bulimic.|`|Gb2ShSR6aa	No, if you were actually sick from eating the Oreos. However, if you felt 'fat' or felt 'sick' because of guilt from the Oreos, then I would suggest you talk someone to help you deal with the feelings you have. You don't want it to spiral out of control.<br>  <br>  Like I said, if you actually got sick...then you threw up, it's not any eating disordered bahavior. It is generally unsafe to force yourself to throw up, did you use anything to make yourself throw up? Ipecac syrup or anything? That can really screw with your heart, and I would strongly suggest checking in with your doctor. <br>  <br>  Bulimia has a pattern of over-eating or binging (for some it's 1,000 calories others it's 10,000) and purging (vomitting, laxative/diuretic/diet pill abuse, over exercise, or fasting). Bulimics are typically aware of what they are doing is wrong, but still continue to participate in the behaviors because it provides 'control'. <br>  <br>  If you continue to force yourself to throw up, you might have a problem, but if it's a one-time deal it will not be considered an eating disorder.|`|dIr3HCn4aa	Bulemia is when you overeat (binge) and then forcibly vomit  (purge) to get rid of all the food you just ate.  So, no -- you aren't bumelic if this was a one-time thing and you don't do this on a regular basis and certainly not to lose weight.  <br>  <br>  A word of caution -- forcing yourself to vomit is generally unsafe, anyway.  If you are going to vomit, let it happen on its own and don't force it.|`|23xqdHFOaa	nope.|`|9Qh47fZ7aa	no you're not bulemic if you only threw up once cuz you felt sick.....just dont make it a habit!|`|AA11920339	No- ur not Bulemic for making urself throw up once. Bulemia is a serious eating disorder where people binge eat & then force themselves to puke on a daily basis.  As long as u don't make a habit of this ur okay! Although u should never force urself to vomit it can cause serious damage to the lining in ur throat.|`|FspDzAs2aa	No. You just had an upset stomach. Do not do it regularly, however; one time will not harm you but if it becomes ritual you can encounter serious medical problems.|`|XxIQqytzaa	Aww Honey .. You Would Know If You Was Bulimic ..<br>  <br>  Your Not Bulimic .. FACE IT !!|`|lSGUBmY7aa	Hilarious..... I have struggled with bulimia for 17 years so I don't really see the humor in your question but if you want the truth..... yes, if you purge because you binged on too many cookies then that would be bulimic behavior.|`|AA12285104	not if u just did it once. bulemia is making urself puke after every time u eat. ppl gorge themselves then go and puke it up. <br>  <br>  here u can read about it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.raderprograms.com/bulimia.aspx?gclid=CNDvroudm44CFQIpFQodCEvhZA" rel="nofollow">http://www.raderprograms.com/bulimia.asp...</a>

Could be really strong pot, or pot laced with crack (crack is always smoked, never snorted), or a certain brand name.

rhcm8EaZaa	I don't think you should be so hard on yourself but that is much easier said than done. Still  though...give yourself a break. Then use this energy to try to develop healthy eating and exercise patterns now.  I think everyone can take that advice<br>  <br>    I think ballet is a great idea for a variety of reasons. I have taken ballet for 3 and 1/2 years and it is one of the best things I have ever done for myself. It has greatly helped my strength, my sense of balance, my connection with my body, my self confidence, my grace, my posture,my coordination,  my rhythym(before ballet I had none), my flexibility and more.  I absolutely love it and I intend to do it for the rest of my life. You may love it and you may not but the things you learn will stick with you forever. It is a pretty intense discipline, It isn't easy to get good, you will get frustrated but stick with it. When you feel yourself advance it is so rewarding.<br>  <br>  and don't let anyone tell you or anyone else that it is too late to start. I started when I was 39 years old and today at 42 I am in the best shape I have ever been.<br>  <br>  I have also developed an appreciation for ballet. I go see it live whenever I can.<br>  <br>  <br>    I also will pitch my other exercise fascination these last few years. Jump roping is a great workout for many reasons. It is quick and portable. I find it extremely challenging.

This would give you a clue as to when to prepare to get yours.<br>  You need to communicate with her FAST. Cause, she didn't communicate with you. You be the adult.

Eating highly nutritious foods is the key, so think in terms of lean protein, veggies, whole-grains, fruits, low-fat dairy, and heart-healthy oils.<br>  <br>  The second option is to do a short-term "drastic diet" that is designed to last for 2 weeks max.  This would take off the most weight rapidly.  There are several on the site under "Diet Plans" but my favorite is the 5-4-3-2-1 diet.  <br>  <a href="http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/5-4-3-2-1diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/5-4-...</a><br>  You get to pick what you eat, but you're going to want to pick highly nutritious foods to keep your metabolism working efficiently.  Again, the "eat healthy" page can help you determine what highly nutritious foods are, if you need help with that.  If you go on the short-term diet, then once it's over, follow the guidelines on the "eat healthy" page.  <br>  <br>  Make water your main source of hydration and save the sweet drinks (even diet) for special occasions.  Eliminate as much salt and sugar from your diet as you can.<br>  <br>  The biggest component to fast weight loss is going to be your workout.  You will want to make sure you do a good (30 minute minimum) cardio workout every day for weight loss (3 times a week is sufficient to maintain health).  Activities that use the large leg muscles burn the most calories.  These activities also tone the lower body quite effectively.  Think in terms of<br>  power walking, jogging, biking, skating, swimming laps, jumping rope, dancing, racquetball, and jumping jacks.  To make sure that you're burning fat, you need to be sweating and huffing and puffing.  In addition, do some good stretches and some strength training.  <br>  <a href="http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/target-exercises.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/targ...</a><br>  <br>  You'll find some really good information on the website, including about five pages of weight loss tips, printable weight loss journal pages, printable exercise log sheets, motivational ideas, healthy recipes, etc.<br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|sc7H3oknaa	An enima may help with the problem...in moderation of course :) Or exercise and eat better.

PtRKFnpNaa	- Olá!<br>  <br>  Eu acho muito mais saudável evacuar diariamente.<br>  Porém existem pessoas que só evacuam de 2/2 ou de 3/3 dias e parece ser também normal.<br>  Educar o intestino de acordo com as atividades pessoais do dia-a-dia de cada um, é uma determina??o pessoal de cada um, porém de efeito prático demorado.<br>  O bom funcionamento  intestinal e o ato de evacuar tem que ser levado a sério por todas as pessoas. O mal funcionamento leva a graves conseqüências para a saúde. <br>  Devemos sempre periodicamente fazer exames de fezes, cultura e pesquisa de sangue nas fezes. Remédios contra vermes e parasitas intestinais devem ser tomados pelo menos anualmente.<br>  Um fato curioso e que muitas pessoas desconhecem e que n?o d?o a mínima importancia ao exame anual de fezes, é que a grande maioria das "alergias" s?o causadas por vermes intestinais.<br>  Portanto, as fun??es intestinais devem ser levadas a sério!<br>  <br>  Um excelente dia para você!|`|ebb2f40d43bc74edaf2e68577d29b741aa	Oi, Estrela.<br>  Cago regularmente, de duas á tres vezes ao dia e sinto-me super leve.<br>  Se vc sente dificuldade em defecar, pode fazer uso de mam?o (regularmente) que é uma fruta sem contra-indica??o e ajuda muito á "liberar" teu intestino.<br>  <br>  bjks.|`|vlYnfcPVaa	E saudavel e necessario ir ao banheiro todos os dias...<br>  Continue assim...<br>  <br>  <br>  bjuss???|`|nhKskxaEaa	Todos os dias de preferencia umas 3 vezes ...|`|AaHeVXMxaa	Olá estrela!<br>  <br>  Ir no banheiro todos os dias é muito saudável, e se tu conseguir educar teu intestino assim melhor pra ti!

Pensa que a carne que fica dias deve "estragar", n?o?<br>  E também é comprovado que quem tem intestino pregui?oso tem muito mais chances de ter um cancer no reto do que querm tem o intestino regulado.<br>  Come aveia, que faz bem pra ir ao banheiro e também absorve gorduras, frutas e legumes e evita um pouquinho a carne vermelha que tu vai ver como teu intestino vai melhorar!<br>  <br>  Espero ter ajudado!<br>  <br>  =^^=|`|pBrrXxW9aa	Estrela querida!!<br>  Com certeza que vc tem que ir ao banheiro todos os dias, isto faz parte da natureza, como uma das respostas aqui postadas vc se alimenta todos os dias ent?o o mais saudável é ir ao banheiro todos os dias e de preferncia com que seu intestino funcione no mesmo horário, como muita fruta como pera, mam?o, cereal, barras de cereal, e tome o (danoneactive) um por dia.

O que entra, tem que sair, dando lugar a um novo bolo fecal. O melhor é criar um hábito diário para evacuar. há pessoas que necessitam de 2 a 3 vezes ao dia, o que é normal, dependendo-se do que coma. Fezes s?o os restos inúteis do que comemos, e um organismo limpo delas diariamente é sim saudável. Com o tempo, seu organismo irá se acostumar com o novo hábito, e dará o ¨alarme¨quando chegar a hora H. Beba bastante líquido, acrecente fibra aos poucos em sua alimenta??o, evitando entupimentos por excesso, se ficar muito secas as fezes, aumente a ingest?o de gorduras(azeite, oleo canola) , exercícios. Você vai ver como seu intestino vai funcionar 100%. abra?os.|`|31i1vnj5aa	O normal seria ir todos os dias, e se vc vai todos os dias e alguns falam e se snete mal é porq seu organismo já tinha se acostumado a ir todos os dias, ent?o continue assim e acrescente em sua alimenta??o alimentos ricos em fibras que vai melhorar ainda mais essa quest?o!|`|8DL1zyIGaa	Olha querida infelismente tenho o mesmo problema  e n?o posso te ajudar vou ficar de olho em suas resposta para que assim eu tbm possa me policiar . bjinhs|`|UV9V6hTJaa	 tome um purgante todos os dias no mesmo horário ,assim você criara o habitu e com o tempo n?o precisara tomar mais, pois seus intestino se acortumou|`|pgviONsSaa	Melhor ir todos os dias, do que ficar "segurando" e ficar enfezada!|`|CtjGhf3iaa	Tome 3 colheres de sopa de óleo de rícino!é tiro e queda!!!Você vai se sentir no céu!!!Ou n?o!!!|`|aG8a6j1Xaa	ehehe eu fa?o coc? a cada 2 ou 3 dias... tem gente que faz 2 ou 3 por dia? kkkkkkkk<br>  <br>  como consegue?|`|6npGDBWmaa	Eu vou 3 x por dia.

I woke up and thought I was dying! I didn't want to tell my mom so I wrapped my undies in tp and went to school. I told my friend my crotch was bleeding and she said she would bring me something the next day and that I should go to the school nurse. The nurse was like no you're not dying you're having your period and it happens to all girls. The next day my friend comes in with a box of these super ginormous tampons that were her moms. She then explained what her mom had told her and I wasn't having the whole stick that huge tube in my crotch. lol.|`|1TyMZXwEaa	i was at school...and i went to the bathroom before fourth period and shwow! there it was! it was leaking...through my pants...haha well at least i had a long shirt on! fun experience! lol

Where you moving anyways?? i live in ontario|`|PzbvjcBVaa	i remember when i was your age...i went through the same thing!!! since your sooo young...my suggestion would be to increase you physical activity.....drink a lot of water....do a lot of running...participate in sports over the summer...and eat only when ur hungry. do NOT over eat! do that and you will be fine!! GOOD LUCK!|`|4WJ0bQyiaa	ur not going to lose 72 pounds by august no offence.<br>  thats unrealistic. if ur serious about it its going to take time not just one long run on the treadmill....do 8 minute abs 3 times a day (u can find the video on youtube) and in a few months ull see results|`|6QxZH3D0aa	At 12 I was about the same height and weight.

People should NOT tease you based on your weight or anything. I suggest to tell them nicely to leave you be. You can loose weight by using Weight Watchers. A lot of children/teens have used it and it worked for them. Try being on this diet each before August comes. August isn't a long time a way; so I suggest you get to it! Another option is, you can use the South Beach Diet. Most adults use this, but teens can use it too! South Beach diet is a lot of healthy food that make you loose weight. The last option I have for you is to just exercise. Go to your local gym and work out for a little bit, it will help! Try this everyday because I think you are the right age to be able to do this! Also, you can go to your local pool and swim everyday. Do about 10 laps across the pool per day! I bet that will make you the weight you want to be!<br>  <br>  ~Hope this helps!~ <Tailor>|`|BWGuUEG5aa	Loosing weight fast is always an unhealthy thing.<br>  There are many diets who tell you that you can loose a lot of weight in no time. And it is working, but you are doing no good to your body. And there's also the Jojo-effect.<br>  The best thing to loose and hold a healthy weight is healthy food, less sugar, lots of drinking water, and sports.<br>  Diet has to begin in your head. And you already started to think about your nutrition. That's an important step. It is too easy just to make a magazine-diet for 2-3 weeks and loose some weight. But it will come back soon again. If you are over-thinking your nutrition and activity, you will have a constantly good result.

9f7292c3270df51eb281378313276e5daa	For God's sake, do not drag it out like some of your other answers suggest.  I'm sure he said it lovingly (every good relationship causes weight gain, I've tacked on 30 w/ my bf of one year), but it has to come from you IF you're ready to lose a few.  Just propose some walking or healthier choices when dining together.|`|WXpKPLetaa	Go to the gym with him. You don't actually have to work out together. you can do your own thing or just walk on the treadmill while he works out. If he is a gym nut, I am sure he spends at least an hr working out. As you get in better shape you can do classes or even start with the weights. I am sure your boyfriend would love to show you some stuff. not only will you get in better shape, but it is something you guys can enjoy doing together. My wife an I go to the gym together all the time, then a 2 mile walk after wards. No offense, but 5 lbs is a fair amount. Being a man, I know my fear would be"if she gained 5 lbs in the first 6 months, what is she going to gain if we get married". Sorry if that sounds mean, but I think men get a little scared of that kind of thing.|`|jUULrtxJaa	i wouldn't think that he would say that to want you to go to the gym with you because obviously its an uncomfortable situation and he probably just saying that you've gained some weight and that's not always bad but just eat a snack before eating a large meal like dinner or lunch because then you get fuller easier  and you wouldnt have to burn more calories<br>  i hope you found your answer best of luck<br>  janet |`|3ZWhK1MTaa	   Dont worry ask him if you can go to the gym with him. It will show him that you are trying to make an effort. Its also a good way to spend time with each other every week. <br>  <br>  Its also a great way to keep fit. If hes a real man he wont care how you look. He probably dosnt care now he just thought he d menchion it.|`|AA10168687	I have a way you can drop 150lbs in 30 seconds.  Get rid of your boyfriend!  That was an awful thing for him to say - I don't care how nice he was saying it!|`|d3r4zGF6aa	Don't worry, even if you have I'm sure he'll still love you. Do a bit more exercise if it's worrying you otherwise if you feel happy the way you are there is no need to change for anyone|`|Z3WbP3P1aa	Most Generic Answer of All Time But It's The Truth:<br>  Do whatever makes you feel good.<br>  If he's telling you this in a negative way, he's not worth it.|`|AA10064810	I am a woman who has gained a "little" weight, too. <br>  <br>  There is a point when that 5 pounds really does show.  Maybe that's what he means.  When I am thinner, my weight can fluctuate up to 5 pounds depending on what I'm eating.  When I am heavier, it can cause the love handles to show just enough to be noticeable.<br>  <br>  As a long time married woman, here is what I suggest you do:  Ask him if it bothers him.  You need to know if it does or doesn't.  If it bothers him and you expect to gain weight as you get older, have babies, develop a condition that puts the weight on, you have to know how much that will really bother him.  He won't be evil if that's true but you need to know where he stands.  Will he complain?  Get upset?  Find you not attractive?  You really don't want to marry someone who does.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you gained weight isn't the issue.  It is that he noticed something and commented on it.  Is that criticism or just observation?  Think about your motives when you do the same thing. <br>  <br>  Do you want to go to the gym with him?  It will certainly help keep you toned and your muscles strong as you get older.  Many women develop osteoporosis and need to exercise to stop or reverse bone loss.  Exercising now can make that take longer to develop or not develop at all.  This will also give him an opportunity for him to use his experience and show you how to do things you don't know about.  Makes a body feel good.<br>  <br>  There is no sense in getting mad about this.  He is who he is and you are who you are.  You might just be facing a line that a 6-pack, work out guru just realized is in his mind. What you want is a relationship with someone who won't hold this against you because it will come up over and over again.  Just like you shouldn't be with someone with a habit you can't stand and then nag, nag, nag.  (You can start doing this without realizing.  It is a real love killer).<br>  <br>  So the question isn't I didn't think I gained weight but he said something, what's up with that?  It is, how much effect will this issue have on our future happiness?  After all, did the fact that he is a 6-pack, work out guru have any attraction for you?  What will happen when he starts to develop that middle-age belly or flabby butt? <br>  <br>  This is the time to start actually sharing ideas and opinions with someone not just putting your party face on.<br>  <br>

dfcdace149ca4068c093f8f63591283faa	yes spinning is good. but as baldy said try some weights too. and why cant you diet. here  is a diet that is easy to follow. <br>  you don't need to starve yourself to lose wieght. infact sometimes, you need to eat more protein, to burn the fat! <br>  for a workable diet - <br>  here is what my dietician suggests - follow a practical diet. start your meal with a soup or a huge salad. this fills u up. Make sure your plate has this ratio - 50 per cent veg, 25 per cent carb. potatoes, corn and peas come in carbs category. 25 per cent protein.this will prevent cravings too.an occassional treat is OK. have a snack every three hours. fruit ,ideally berries, or soy nuts. just 2 tbsp of soya subsides hunger pangs. have a protein shake too, if you want. it will fight the fat and give you extra energy to exercise. switch from white rice and bread to brown. eat 900gms of veggies a day.Needless to say, NO soda, chips, cookies! Lose a kilo a week. that is permanent loss. pick an exercise regime you like. <br>  get a pedometer and try to take 10,000 steps everyday.|`|XNeJp5i8aa	Spinning can burn a lot of calories and you should lose weight.

Um spray que funciona rapidamente. Todos os ingredientes do spray para parar de roncar s?o naturais e aprovados pelo FDA nos EUA. Mais de 80% das pessoas que usaram este spray pararam de roncar. Produto fácil de usar: basta espirrar uma vez debaixo da língua e espirrar uma vez para atingir a garganta, sempe antes de dormir. Tem efeito imediato.<br>  <br>  2)Outro artigo sobre o mesmo assunto:<br>  <br>  Quem ronca, além de incomodar o parceiro, pode também ter distúrbios respiratórios durante o sono. Esses distúrbios s?o interrup??es completas ou parciais da respira??o, as apnéias ou hipopnéias. <br>  <br>  O ronco é o som resultante do fluxo aéreo turbulento por vias aéreas estreitas. Com o ronco, a estruturas da faringe podem estreitar, gerando obstru??o e, conseqüentemente, a apnéia obstrutiva do sono. Como mencionado, com a apnéia, há uma interrup??o na passagem de ar e diminui??o da oxigena??o pulmonar e sangüínea. <br>  <br>  Até aí tudo bem, pois a queda da oxigena??o é percebida pelo cérebro e a pessoa acorda antes que algo pior aconte?a. O problema é que roncadores profissionais chegam a ter dezenas de apnéias por hora e portanto dezenas de microdespertares. O resultado é um sono ineficiente, com excessiva sonolência diurna, queda da performance geral, depress?o, irritabilidade e até diminui??o da libido. <br>  <br>  Vários tratamentos prometem a cura do ronco, mas os únicos comprovadamente eficazes s?o o CPAP, um respirador mecanico utilizado durante o sono; próteses ortod?nticas que reposicionam a mandíbula e cirurgias que atuam em diferentes pontos das vias aéreas. <br>  <br>  <br>  Uma melhora nos hábitos de vida também ajuda.

5pjz22bbaa	If you're so concerned with losing such a large amount of weight in such a short time, then you're taking the WRONG approach.<br>  <br>  I know it's not what you want to hear, but you need to simply focus on the mechanics of it all and the pounds will come off themselves, in time.  <br>  <br>  Watch what you eat (try 1,200 calories a day to lose weight), limiting fat grams and sugars.  Exercise or walk or whatever - cardiovascular activity is a MUST.  Portion control is also important - I've heard that a good measure is to not eat anything larger than the size of your fist.  <br>  <br>  The "bottom line" is that you must burn more calories than you consume.  Good luck - it takes diligence.  Stay "active" enough and you wouldn't even have to count calories (but of course, YOU need to "step it up" or you wouldn't be overweight).|`|wZd7kaX8aa	We offer the following tips to help you lose weight to look better, feel better, and live a healthier life.

Do not set unreasonable goals.  It is very unhealthy to lose that much weight so quickly.

So a lot of these ideas about losing weight, make you fatter. Cutting calories, carbs and fats can cause you to have a weight problem for life. It is better to eat differently. See site below and learn why lean meat and non-fat yogurt are so fattening. The people counting calories are the fat people.<br>  <br>  Also salt has no calories but makes you fat. This also has the quickest weight loss possible. Eat good carbs, not bad carbs. Nourish your body thin, instead of starving your body fat. Eat foods made by nature <br>  and avoid foods made by man which are designed to make you fat and very addicted to food.

Repeat this cycle again and again till you reach your goal.<br>  <br>  References:<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv1-mdp&p=Calories+chart">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a><br>  <br>  *********************************<br>  Life Style Change Program for Loosing Weight<br>  By<br>  minootoo<br>  <br>  Who needs to loose weight?<br>  <br>  Answer is simply not every one, only the over weight person.<br>  <br>  Who is over weight?<br>  <br>  This is simple, it is easy to find out and it is available on line, it is call Body Mass Index, and calculations are simple. According to this calculation if you find your self say only 10 pounds more, you may not be over weight. Remember every one is slightly different and you can just watch it, on your own and not let it get out of hand.<br>  <br>  What is the reason for being over weight?<br>  <br>  This is also simple, have doctor check you out for any physical or hormonal abnormalities. The doctor should be advising you of your ideal weight even though you have already figured out the ideal weight and you are seen a doctor because your weight is not where it should be according to BMI.<br>  <br>  Basic understanding of loosing weight.<br>  <br>  Every one uses calories at all time. There may be some exceptions to this rule, for most of us; the rate of use, even when we are resting, we use 65 calories per hour minimum. This comes to1560 calories per day. The actual range is between 65 and 100 calories per hour. This is consistent with heart rate of 60 to 80 bits per minute.<br>  <br>  Simply put any person eating only say 1500 calories a day will not put on any additional weight. At this level of calories consumption the person should loose some weight over long haul, depending on the individual rate of metabolism.<br>  <br>  What is a healthy weight loss?<br>  <br>  When one tries to loose weight, one should loose excess fat; there should be a healthy loss of weight. Loosing muscles tissue is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  How much is one pound of body fat?<br>  <br>  One pound of body fat weight is approximately same as one pound of butter. If you look at a one pound package of butter, you will see it contains between 3200 to 3600 calories. This means that each time a person burns 3600 more calories then what the person takes in, the person will loose one pound.<br>  <br>  How many pounds should a person loose in a month?<br>  <br>  Any one that is trying to trim down can figure out how long it took to put on the excess pounds. The fact is; it did not happen over night. It usually creeps up, but the person realizes one day suddenly.<br>  <br>  This is why a person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  Taking above in to consideration a person should not loose more then 2 pounds per month. If a person looses any thing more then that, chances are that the person will not be able to maintain the weight loss. It will take extra efforts to loose and it will take extra efforts to keep it off. Remember slow and steady wins the race.<br>  <br>  <br>  When an overweight person should start loosing weight?<br>  <br>  At once. The person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Again do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  How does body react to weight lose?<br>  <br>  Any time there is depletion of fat beyond certain level, the body reacts by slowing down metabolism, so that it can build up fat. If the body is use to say 2000 calories per day and detects only 1500 calories per day for considerable length of time it reacts to the situation by reducing the rate of metabolism. When this happens one need to help body by increasing activity. Usually takes about four weeks for body to react.<br>  <br>  What is the relationship between body and body fat?<br>  <br>  Under ideal condition fat act as a reserved energy source for our body. Certain level of fat is good for healthy living and even may save our life in certain life threatening situations. Every one should have minimum required level of fat on their body.<br>  <br>  What if there is no weight loss at 1500 calories in take level?<br>  <br>  This is a rear occurrence. Do not panic. The body has slowed down the metabolism to such a great extent that you must help it. The only way to help is to increase activities, this means you have to exercise. You do not need to join Gym but you can go on an an half an hour walk every day or batter still engage in a power walk for same duration. Power walk burns 250 calories per hour and walk burns 100 calories per hour approximately.<br>  <br>  What is the importance of body fat for a female?<br>  <br>  Females require little more body fat then men. In the absence of certain required level of body fat, females are not able to function properly; in particular they may not be able to conceive. You can find lot more about this on internet.<br>  <br>  At 1500 calories intake per day what one must drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  One gallon of liquids most of witch should be in the form of water (zero calories).<br>  Calories should be accounted for all other liquids.<br>  <br>  Why water?<br>  <br>  Water is a universal solvent, means it dissolves almost every thing at least in very minute quantities. This helps purification of body.<br>  <br>  Eat<br>  <br>  What should be your proportionate in take of fat, Proteins and Complex Carbohydrates?<br>  <br>  This depends on what your need are.<br>  <br>  1. Need to reduce fat.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 30 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 60 percent of 1500 calories per day = 900 calories.<br>  <br>  2. Need more energy.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 40 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>  <br>  3. Need to reduce weight only.<br>  <br>  Fat: 25 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 375 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 25 percent of 1500 calories per day = 375 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>  <br>  4. Need to increase muscles bulk, but still reduce weight.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 15 percent of 1500 calories per day = 225 calories.<br>  Proteins: 75 percent of 1500 calories per day = 1125 calories.<br>  Exercise the muscles you want to develop, you can find right exercise on line, recommend use of light weights.<br>  <br>  Foot note: To take fat is so important, while reducing even fat, that it is included in all cases. If the fat is completely cut out, body will think of producing the fat, and will produce the fat by reducing metabolism, without fat in take, you may actually again weight even at lower than 1500 calorie level. You will feel run down and lethargic.<br>  <br>  How one must, drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  Every one may not be able to follow this regime.<br>  <br>  A 16 oz glass of water fist thing in the morning will be very healthy start.<br>  If you need to stabilize your stomach before eating, you can have a glass of water just before each and every meal. This is the easiest way to meet your quota of gallon of liquids.<br>  <br>  Eat<br>  <br>  To day almost half the world is starving.<br>  <br>  In western culture. Standard healthy practice for long time was three warm square meals per day. No eating in between, but children were allowed night cap.<br>  <br>  All that has changed, present thinking is 5 to 6 times per day. Any way what practice one follows is up to them; to each his own.<br>  <br>  Another best practice will be a glass of water before bed time, nothing to eat for two hours before bed time.<br>  <br>  How do I know the calorie count for various drinks and food?<br>  <br>  If you are buying packaged items it is on the package.<br>  <br>  Go on the internet and find the calorie information.<br>  <br>  Lots of cook book now a days list calorie per serving.<br>  Use your best guess, in this method use higher figure then you have guessed.<br>  <br>  References:<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv1-mdp&p=Calories+chart">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a>|`|7Qfzu0aDaa	Yes you can really lose your weight by following the natural ways mentioned in our website given below.|`|93462d27d5a25279e6a0490e6bdb8af4aa	Dear I have a solution for your problem.

ZIOLl00xaa	the ortho tricylen lo was great for me....it has way less risks with it then the others such as the patch and the ring.....after i got pregnant i got on it and i still continued to have unprotected sex with my boyfriend and never got pregnant. So it really helps as long as you take every day at the same time....but i forgot sometimes and was still okay i just double dosed when i forgot a day.... I Suggest it for every one!|`|GoABmevnaa	I actually really like orto tri-cyclen lo.. it's very effective if you use it correctly, and it has a very low dosage of hormones which is always good for your body. I didn't have any side effects except my breasts did get a little larger/firmer, which was great lol. I used this bc pill for a while and then was curious to try something new and tried the Ortho Evra Patch... which I regret even to this day. Those are horrible, they don't stay on your skin well, it leaves a sticky reside on your skin and it messed up my hormone's. Since I used the Patch (only for 1 month!!) I've had weird discharge at random times and when I have sex my lubrication is different... and it's because the Patch has very high levels of hormons.  <br>  so research which one is best for you!
mAQHyfCYaa	Some women ovulate during or right after they get their period. A week or so before ovulation some women feel hungrier because the body is trying to prepare enough fat reserves to support a pregnancy if one should occur. Another reason is hormones, hormones, hormones. Hormones cause cravings, mood swings, low energy, etc, all those wonderful symptoms of PMS.|`|Zjb4p1TRaa	Everyone gets hungry :P<br>  If you meant more hungry than normal, some do and some don't.<br>  Don't really think there's a logical explanation.|`|OPjTfhqmaa	probably because your body needs to stock up on the iron its about to lose.

Ii4X7Rkaaa	Stretch it gently, pushing to the point of feeling it, but not actual pain. Alternate ice and heat, about 10 minutes at a time, allowing the muscles to come back to a neutral temperature before you switch. If you've had your splits for that long, once the muscle has healed itself, your splits should be back in no time. Just be patient and don't work it too hard, or you'll risk injuring it more.|`|eAnJXoM0aa	I did this a few years ago and ended up tearing a muscle in my thigh. I went to the doctor, and he said that pretty much all you can do it to rest as much as you can for a couple weeks until it starts healing. Don't do the splits right now, because it might make it worse. I can't tell if you actually tore it or not, but icing and rest isn't a bad idea. good luck! :)
nwsheineaa	No! That's starving yourself! When you do that, your body thinks its going into starvation mode, so it stores every bit of fat that your body takes in, thus making you GAIN weight.|`|AA11780307	Well you friend either wants to get really sick or she thinks it's cool. It's not. This is an extremely poor way to lose weight. Don't try it.|`|tIr4XbDMaa	WEll I'm always interested in the definition of the word 'works'....  This plan will most definitely 'work' really really well at slowing down and messing up your metabolism because all the days you eat nothing, your body goes into famine mode and holds onto it's fat supplies.  Then on the day that you eat normally - you'll land up over eating because you'll be starving.  So short term it may apparently help you to lose weight (if it does) but long term all it'll work for is regaining weight.... here's an explanation for how that happens.|`|nMHxO5gBaa	Absolutely not advisable.<br>  <br>  Actually, weight control is a rather simple equation in understanding energy balance which is the key to losing weight successfully.<br>  <br>  Calorie intake > Calorie use ==> Weight Gain<br>  <br>  Calorie intake = Calorie use ==> No change in body weight<br>  <br>  Calorie intake < Calorie use ==> Weight loss<br>  <br>  Losing weight does not mean avoiding food. Instead, eat less food that is high in fat and added sugar. Eat a variety of plant-based food like whole grains, fruit and vegetables. These food provide bulk and promote the feeling of fullness.<br>  <br>  Eat regular meals and avoid skipping meals as it may lead to overeating at subsequent meals.<br>  <br>  Move more – Exercise.<br>  <br>  Physical activity is an essential part of any effective weight loss programme. It helps burn calories and builds muscles.|`|GemPuPFJaa	NO NO NO NO NO   also that is a crash diet there is no way ur gonna spend the rest of ur life eating that way and as soon as u start eating normally u will gain all the weight back plus more|`|eKG6cj3jaa	Coming from a recovered anorexic who almost lost her life,<br>  <br>  I think you AND your friend are ******* retarded.|`|K5tzag9Paa	No your body will go into starvation mode.definately not a good idea.Try some other diet,i am on a shake diet and have lost 8kg so far in 7 weeks.|`|HGSrfxajaa	thats just mad and not healthy at all.|`|BCeyEvDuaa	definetly not!!|`|jprXS0JTaa	good way to die ! 
ioaEN0w9aa	hi sorry to hear your not well , the only things i can think of are plain chicken, so no spices or oils ,cooked obviously, scrambled eggs is another good one as they are easily digested into the stomach , oh and plenty of liquids as you will lose a lot of fluids from your body , and you don't want to end up dehydrated. well all that is left for me to say is , GET WELL SOON lol|`|AA10905773	soup will work|`|cZCg9x5gaa	chew some ice, it will make you feel less sick|`|tODmXD1waa	Best thing to eat is  stew iam getting over flu at the moment and stew was my saving grace it is the ultimate in comfort food and avoid anything sugary and carbonated drinks|`|0PUvP7Otaa	not sure if this helps you or not but here are some things you can use to avoid getting sick in the future <a href="http://www.mannpill.com/health/health/best-ways-to-beat-a-cold.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mannpill.com/health/health/be...</a>

I got dust and dog hair everywhere.. hahaha. it gets cleaned on the weekends.. but I suppose if you are alergic to dust or whatnot, you would get sick....  as for the cold? Colds run its course.. no way to get rid of it quickly, all you can do is relieve the symptoms so you can rest.  Sleep is the best thing that I have found for when I get colds.  Ever notice how in the morning, you feel ok, then as the day winds down, you start feeling worse?? Rest/sleep.. is the best thing.|`|HclKftzAaa	if your house isn't clean, yes it can make you sick.<br>  <br>  things like mice/rats and their droppings, dust mites. and mold, particularly black mold, can all make you sick.<br>  <br>  drink lots of water, have honey lemon tea. avoid dairy (makes extra goop in throat). rest.|`|mFtuN9X0aa	Yup. Your environment affects your body. Things that induce colds are mold, bacteria, dust mites, dust, dirt, yeast and fungus on house hold surfaces. If your house is messy then there's more area for the organisms to settle.<br>  <br>  Natural remedies that worked for me would be drinking a lot or orange juice and green tea. And sleeping (a lot).
mefwTmwQaa	a charlie horse tho painful usually reaches it's peak at 3 days thankfully.

No tub? Use a hot water bottle, lay muscle on it and after the muscle is warmed up, gently flex the toe out and pull toes toward you, flexing the muscles in the leg, go easy and do the flexes slowly. You may have pulled the hamstring and may need to wear a wrap for awhile to support the thigh muscles until your leg feels better.|`|7RemVrsgaa	Charlie Horses can be caused by lack of potassium.When you feel one come on apply as much pressure as you can to that area, no matter how much it hurts!

ASUexkSdaa	Look for a psychiatrist who specializes is treating ADHD.  They are most familiar with the various ADHD meds.  Since you haven't been seeing anyone recently, whoever you go to may want to go through the whole diagnosing thing before prescribing for you- they won't just take your word for it.  <br>  <br>  Ask all financially related questions before you make an appointment, so you know what your responsibility will be.  Some doctors reduce their fees for patients who don't have insurance.  At the very least, you can try your local public health department.  That probably won't be as good as a private doctor, however (based on my sister's ADHD experience with her lphd).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|fFVAr5Idaa	I did research. Even in very small communities there is always help out there. I found a place that saw me for a very small fee and gave me my medication for free. And every county has a health department. Also try United Way-- 211.<br>  <br>  I did a search online for "free doctors Dekalb County" or Atlanta, or whatever. or low cost. Now I live in a very tiny part of NC with cows and chickens and there are places to go that charge you by your income, or lack of income.<br>  <br>  I understand how difficult it is to get low cost doctors visits, but it IS possible. If I did it for ten years, you can find a doctor as well. But it will take a bit of research.<br>  |`|GglZt0pbaa	I dont know where you are but if you will go to your local social services department I am very sure that they can set you up with a free clinic near you.

Big cities always have health departments that serve people for free including medicines.  Go to the Health Department and ask to speak to a doctor about your ADD.

Scommetto che (ipopteticamente) se qualcuno ti "costringesse" a fare il piercing sulla lingua ..... come minimo ..... lo denunceresti x violenza fisica e psichica!<br>  In effetti, non so se potresti avere qualche problema; ti dico che, molte parti del corpo, hanno un loro riferimento con la totalità del corpo umano e di molti organi; la lingua è 1 organo delicatissimo ed estremamente necessario; xkè "violentarlo"?

Jg1BAqAOaa	Red blood after a bowel movement usually represents hemorrhoids or a bowel fissure (tear).  If you bleed a lot or often, you need treatment by a doctor.

rifjqRc1aa	I suffered from agoraphobia for years and years.  So I know how you feel. I too felt bored, so I did a degree in Psychology and with extra majors in sociology. It was great!

I just wonder what purpose that serves for you? That's self-defeating and a potential booby-trap. You could try taking walks, riding a bike, or just sitting in your yard. Maybe get a pet? You've recognized your problem and that's your start. I wish you well.|`|854e0a57f83e0420840aebc82b71ef9aaa	I understand about the not taking medication. I also have a phobia... of grasshoppers. The thing about it is I have snakes, one 16 ft long as pets. Spiders, crickets, worms, don't bother me but a few years ago I spent 45 min. in a cab, in my driveway, with the meter running because a swarm of grasshoppers was passing over. After that, and my kids bringing them in to scare me with, I decided to confront my fear. I waited for the majority of the swarm to pass by and went outside. I caught one and held it until I could stop hyperventilating and breath normal. Then I let it go. I still don't like them but they don't debilitate me. My kids still tease me and I tell them that's what a phobia is...an irrational fear. I guess what I'm trying to say after all that is this. Confront it. Take charge. You said you feel angry so use that anger in a positive way and walk out the door. You don't have to go across town or even down the street. Just wait till you can breath easy and go back inside. The next day, go a little farther. Turn the anger into a positive thing... strength to deal with this head on.

aqHhoGXdaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Ephedrine is nasty - do you really want to take it??<br>  <br>  In the UK it is a prescription only medicine but it depends on the dose.<br>  <br>  You can buy the 8mg tablets online but the 30mg and 60 mg tablets are strictly POM.|`|D02ibfgnaa	near enough any where online that does suplements,  if you chuck it in google it would go crazy,<br>  <br>  just so you dont end up getting ripped off with crap, <br>   I would look (google)  for a forum group or something of people who are into training , weights , sports etc, they will probablly be using ephadra or ephedrine as part of there daily routine , they are likely to know the best source.|`|WnvaG1U0aa	Before you even look into buying ephedrine I'd recommend that you ask yourself what you're using it for and why you think you need it. It's dangerous and highly addictive (a sister to crack in the meth family)... don't take it.

Instead of using your fingers to try to trigger your gag reflex to purge, you can go outside or to the gym and exercise, as well as making sure you don't binge to begin with. <br>  <br>  The side effects of this are weight loss, fitness, healthy, and longevity instead of wearing the enamel off your teeth with your stomach acid, smelling like vomit, losing your hair, getting flaky/yellow skin, and physical and mental collapse. <br>  <br>  So stop being lazy. |`|mPKDmMJoaa	Anorexia and Bulimia are both Mental Disorders.<br>  <br>  Bulimia has a more physical side and is often "more thought out" then those who simply starve themselves (anorexics).<br>  <br>  There is no "good" way to become Bulimic or Anorexic. They will both cause horrible medical problems and even death. <br>  <br>  Eating Disorders are not a "cool" fade, or a good diet. They are a seriouse issue.

AA10478980	There is not much you can do about it.  There is no over-the-counter medication or home remedy that cures cold sores.  Only time will take care of that.  But there is a good prescription medication for cold sores.  It will make them go away much faster, and as a result of taking this medication you will have far fewer outbreaks of cold sores.<br>     <br>  For your future reference, the absolute best treatment for cold sores is a prescription medication in pill form called Valtrex.  It was intended for genital herpes, but cold sores are caused by the same family of viruses, and Valtrex stops colds sores in their tracks.  None of the other treatments come close to the effectiveness of Valtrex, not the ointment Zovirax, and certainly not Abreva or anything else.  Ask your doctor about it to see if you would be a good candidate for this medication.  My doctor prescribed it for me for cold sores about five years ago and after taking it only a couple of times I hardly ever get a cold sore any more, and before Valtrex I was having several attacks a year.  On the rare occasions that I do get one now, it is gone almost immediately when I take the medication - in about a day.

ZksUYSGSaa	you are perfect weight! <br>  dont become obbsessive and develop a dissorder okay?<br>  i know you dont think it could ever happen to you, but i can, so be aware.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt try and lose more weight<br>  just do some cardio and lots of crunches for that tummy pudge we all have :)|`|WQlKXzsVaa	I had the exact same problem. The best solutionis to cut your meals into small portions throughout the day. Because where you digest, the food goes to the top of your stomach first, making it look like the patchy form. Try drinking plenty of water and working a little more on the stomach with simple exersizes such as crunches, or something fun like dancing, really depends on you. The main problem is just the size of the portion you eat. Good luck with your weight loss and god bless!|`|jJ2ehZdXaa	all you have to do is yoga and situps / crunches. alot of each. thats how ive gotten a flat belly.<br>  <br>  okay, ahah, how did you lose that weight that you recently losttt? because im just 5 6 and i weigh a tiny more than 134. but like, people thing im just the healthy weight and i dont look like i weigh it, like the doctors would be like, "so you weigh about, 115 or less right?" so your probably like me, i dont think you need to loose much weight. but what exactly did you do to loose that weight from before?!|`|JbP5GaRXaa	I would cut down on carbs short term.

And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free. It makes you not snack because if you chew it, you dont want to snack because then you will have to spit out your gum! works for me.. <br>  <br>  thats my trick tip - now read the losing weight 411<br>  <br>  EXTRA: breathing for an hour burns 60 calories, so thats a little lift off your chest haha<br>  and sleeping is the same rate :)<br>  <br>  excersise at least 60 minutes a day if you can :)<br>  -------<br>  hey, you know what? The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things. Bread is a bad, so try to stick to thin, HIGH in fiber, slices :) <br>  <br>  you can google all the stuff and before you know it you will feel so good about it all and IM actually excited to start working out and all that, just because I know what it will do for me!<br>  <br>  but if you must go with a diet, try Weight Watchers, its the only one I actually recommend. :)

También aporta seguridad y su facilidad facilita su práctica a personas que por distintos motivos no pueden practicar otros deportes. <br>  <br>   En el sistema cardiaco-vascular<br>  <br>  La natación es el deporte aeróbico por excelencia, el trabajo aeróbico moderado y continuado es el mas aconsejado para el músculo mas importante de nuestro organismo, el corazón. <br>  El corazón con el ejercicio aeróbico se muscula, se fortalece y pierde la grasa que lo rodea. Por lo que cada latido es hace más potente y puede trasladar mas sangre al resto del organismo. <br>  Como resultado se produce una bajada de la frecuencia cardiaca en reposo, lo que mejora la economía y la eficacia de nuestro corazón. <br>  <br>  Por la misma razón aumenta el calibre de las arterias coronarias, causantes de muchos de los problemas del sistema cardiovascular. Ayudando así al corazón a ser mas eficaz en el trasporte y retorno de la sangre. <br>  <br>  Reduce la tensión arterial, por lo que todo el organismo sale beneficiado. <br>  <br>  En el sistema respiratorio<br>  <br>  Con la natación fortalecemos todos los músculos, también los que se encargan de llenar y vaciar de aire los pulmones, haciendo que en cada respiración podamos tomar mas aire con menos gasto energético, haciendo la respiración mas eficiente, aumentando la oxigenación y reduciendo el estrés de estos músculos respiratorios, esto motiva una baja de la frecuencia respiratoria. <br>  <br>  Cuando nadamos a crol mantenemos la respiración y se produce una deuda de oxigeno que motiva al organismo a aumentar la densidad de los glóbulos rojos de la sangre y la capacidad de estos para transportar oxigeno. <br>  <br>  Aumenta la superficie de transmisión del oxigeno a la sangre, esto se produce por una mayor capilarización y por un mayor numero de alvéolos en funcionamiento. <br>  <br>  Aumenta nuestra capacidad pulmonar y limpia nuestros pulmones. <br>  <br>   En nuestros músculos.<br>  <br>  La natación bien planificada ejercita todas articulaciones aumentamos la flexibilidad dinámica de estas, por lo que nuestro rango de movimiento aumenta. <br>  <br>  Los músculos aumentan de tama?o haciéndose mas fuertes y resistentes a lesiones. <br>  <br>  Los huesos aumentan de groso haciéndose más resistentes a golpes y lesiones. <br>  <br>  El aumento de la eficacia de las articulaciones debido a la musculación de tendones y ligamentos y a una mejora de la lubricación interna, sumado al aumento de la masa muscular y de su resistencia, hace que nuestra calidad de vida aumente exponencialmente. Pudiendo retrasar el evenjencimiento y aumentar las posibilidades de expansión como persona móvil e independiente. <br>  <br>  En nuestra psique<br>  <br>  La mejora de la calidad de vida, de la independencia, de nuestras posibilidades físicas, hace que nos sintamos más seguros y que nuestra autoestima aumente. <br>  <br>  La natación normalmente se realiza en grupos en los que los alumnos están en estrecho contacto. El estar en ba?ador reduce las diferencias socio-económica, las personas se presentan tal como son y esto facilita la comunicación. <br>  <br>  Reduce el estrés. <br>  <br>  Aumentamos las actividades de nuestro tiempo libre, haciéndonos más felices. <br>  <br>  Aumentamos nuestros temas de conversación, aumentado por esto nuestra capacidad de socialización. <br>  <br>  Aumentamos nuestro círculo de conocidos. <br>  <br>  Contra el dolor y las lesiones<br>  <br>  El aumento de nuestra capacidad física y de nuestra autoestima afecta reduciendo drásticamente muchos dolores difusos. <br>  <br>  El fortalecimiento de nuestro organismo, hace que estemos más alerta, con más equilibrio y que tengamos un tiempo de reacción complejo más eficiente y rápido, por lo que las caídas y golpes se reducen. <br>  <br>  El fortalecimiento de los músculos, el engrosamiento de los huesos, hace que las caídas sean menos traumáticas y se recupere el estado normal antes que una persona sedentaria. <br>  <br>  Contra el envejecimiento<br>  <br>  Muchos autores afirman que una persona de 65 a?os que haga ejercicio a diario tiene una mayor capacidad física y vital que una persona de 45 a?os que no realiza ninguna actividad física. Estamos hablando de retrasar muchas variables del envejecimiento casi 20 a?os. <br>  <br>  Mejora la vida sexual<br>  <br>  El ejercicio físico, es decir el deporte, mejora la vida sexual desde tres vertientes. La primera especialmente en el hombre al mejorar la condición cardiovascular mejora la capacidad de mantener la tensión arterial, que repercute directamente en el mantenimiento de la erección durante más tiempo y de más calidad. La segunda tanto para el hombre como para la mujer tiene relación con el circuito de la dopamina que se reactiva y aumenta el deseo sexual. La tercera con la reducción del estrés, siendo este el problema más común en los temas de impotencia psicológica. <br>  <br>  Por último también en solteros o solteras la posibilidad de ampliar el círculo de conocidos mejora exponencialmente la posibilidad de encontrar una pareja, y al compartir aficiones es más fácil entablar una conversación. <br>  <br>  |`|p8mOkmWTaa	Adelgazar no se,<br>  pero un dolor estomacal seguro,<br>  gracias por compartir tu sentido del humor,<br>  un saludo.|`|91Lfaklaaa	no voy a soportar un horrible gusto solo para adelgazar.

sqJvanoHaa	an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

But do one thing, depend on and help those around you who are trying to cope, and are hurting too. Go visit the boys parents, family members and friends. Talk to you boyfriend. Talk to your friends. It's never easy, but with each passing day, the pain of it becomes less and less. I buried a baby that I had lost, when I was 5 months pregnant with her. The one thing that meant the most to me was the people that called, and let me talk to them, or me calling friends and just letting me get things out.

You will be asked to take a deep breath and hold it while the x-ray is being taken. You will also be asked to stay as still as possible when the film is taken. <br>  <br>  After they take the films, you will sit in the x-ray room while they develop the films to be sure they are of good quality.

GqGHpCUsaa	I have had my period for almost ten years, and I still tend to miss it from time to time- there can be many reasons that you miss your period- the fact that you are so young (and do not have a normalized cycle yet), stress (usually why I miss mine), or normal body changes that come along with getting older. If you are a virgin, there is nothing to be worried about by way of pregnancy, etc. However. if you go for months at a time without having your period, or have breakthrough bleeding, I would recommend that you go to your doctor.|`|XlQawumaaa	Your still way young, and it takes a while to regulate. Your hormones are balancing out and telling your body what to do. If your a virgin your not pregnant, and there isnt a desease that makes it stop that i know of, Unless you've been really really stressed or you have an eating disorder. So don't worry about it, be happy that you dont have to deal with that this month =P. Unless its just delayed, which sometimes it is. I can tell when mines coming because I have a sudden urge to clean everything in my house lol.

AA12086305	For lunch, I usually have a ham and cheese sandwich on whole grain bread.  Along with an apple or banana and some 1% milk.  The key is to not feel full, but to feel satisfied.

So whatever you do choose, don't stuff it down your throat, take your time and you'll feel a lot better.  <br>  <br>  A good after school snack could be a fruit cup with a variety of different fruit and a granola bar.

Qu'elle ait lieu avant la pénétration ou 5 minutes après, le problème est le même, il n'y a pas de contr?le.<br>  Il ne s'agit pas d'une maladie à proprement parler. L'homme qui éjacule rapidement fonctionne sexuellement bien… même trop bien. Ses réactions sexuelles sont rapides et dans notre monde c'est souvent une qualité d'avoir de bons réflexes. <br>  L'éjaculation prématurée peut être :<br>  ? Primaire si elle a toujours été présente dans la sexualité de l'homme ; <br>  ? Secondaire si elle survient après un temps de sexualité sans problème. <br>  Mais la distinction n'est pas toujours si facile. Parfois, le moment crucial n'intervient pas trop t?t, sans avoir pour autant le contr?le du réflexe éjaculatoire. Ainsi ces hommes ne s'estiment éjaculateurs prématurés que dans un second temps, lorsque cette belle mécanique n'est plus synchrone. Il ne s'agit pas d'éjaculation secondaire pour autant, car leur manque de contr?le dès le début de leur vie sexuelle permet de les diagnostiquer comme souffrant d'éjaculation prématurée primaire.<br>  <br>  L’éjaculation précoce est un problème psychologique bénin qui peut être facilement guéri dans la majorité des cas. La guérison ne s’obtient cependant que si les deux partenaires sont motivés et prêts à suivre quelques séances de " rééducation ". Cette rééducation consiste à réapprendre à percevoir les signes de l’excitation et à retarder l’éjaculation. L’éjaculation prématurée peut retentir sur les relations sexuelles et entra?ner une anxiété qui elle-même peut entra?ner de réels troubles de l’érection.<br>  <br>  En espérant avoir répondu à ta question…<br>  <br>  Amicalement…|`|mTS6wtoMaa	Le mieux de d'entrainer le muscle PC.

AA11336133	cardio! everyone hates to hear it but you can have a great six pack, but if there's any fat over it then you aren't going to see that six pack. <br>  <br>  crunches are great as long you do them properly. here are some exercises:<br>  <br>  Crunch(the right way)-lie on your back with your knees bent, cross your arms over your chest(if you put them behind your neck you'll pull on your neck and potentially strain it) and do the crunch. you want to make sure you look at the ceiling to keep your posture correct and make it effective and you only want to come up about half way or roughly until your elbows hit your thighs. coming all the way up is bad for your back, and once you get more than half way the muscles in your legs take over and your abs are no longer being worked out.<br>  Reverse Crunch-start in a sitting position with your knees bent, put your arms straight out by your knees and do a very slow controlled roll backwards until you're laying on the floor. if you do it slow enough it'll hurt like hell.<br>  V's(awesomely painful)-you start again in the sitting position with your knees bent, the lift your feet off the floor and stick your legs straight out, and your arms out to the side. you end up kind of looking like a V, and then hold that as long as you can, and relax.<br>  Reverse Crunch(another type)-start lying down and then put your feet straight up in the air(so you form an L shape) with your hands beside you on the floor and then lift your hips off the floor. the trick to this is keeping your feet as still as possible. imagine a little box that your feet have to stay in. its very hard and good work.<br>  Leg Lifts-good old fashioned move where you lie on your side with your elbow supporting you and your head in your hand. your other hand should be in front of you supporting you, and you basically lift your legs up off the floor a few inches. this is a great one for working the obliques.<br>  <br>  below i've included a couple of pictures of what some of the moves should look like when done properly. funnily enough the best site i was looking at for proper movement were military websites. you may want to look up the movements on some of their sites too.|`|xML0Oe6Baa	I tried everything to flatten my stomach and get uniform abs.

XEDE48n7aa	by the picture it looks like just a blood blister, i have had many before. They are usually caused by the skin getting a bad pinch.

This is obviously not good.  You don't want the stitches tearing out as that'll cause a lot of pain and complicate healing, including an increased chance for infection.  One of the many possible complications of circumcision.|`|diq9htpuaa	You may be able to bring suit against your doctor if he didn't inform you adequately about the complications.

It's pretty normal, especially for someone going through puberty like you are.  If you let it go long enough (a few days, probably), the discomfort will eventually pass as your body adjusts.  If it's very uncomfortable, your best bet is just to masturbate and "let it out".  If you do try to wait, there's a pretty good chance you'll have some "wet dreams" -- just your body ejaculating during sleep to relieve the pressure on your testicles.  I'm not sure why you're unwilling to masturbate more than once a week -- masturbation is perfectly normal and healthy, especially for a male your age, but you have to decide for yourself what you're comfortable/not comfortable with.<br>  <br>  As I said, I'm fairly sure this is what's going on, but as I'm neither a male or a doctor, I still think you should talk to your doctor.  I know it seems "embarrassing", but it's just part of growing up (sorry if I sound like your mom).  The whole point of having a doctor is so you can ask them embarrassing questions.  I don't think there's anything going on that you need to be worried about, but if there is, your doctor would know, and would be able to tell you what to do about it.  So grit your teeth and talk to your doctor!<br>  <br>  Here's some more info: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_balls" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_balls</a><br>  <br>  good luck!|`|2vZrN0x7aa	its jeniouphobia|`|Bz46a42qaa	i would segest going to the doctor.. that is all i can tell you son.|`|xlVxzX6Gaa	im a girl so im probably not going to be much help but i do no that you SHOULD NOT do it everyday. my friend has scars, sores and bruises from doing it everyday. but dont feel wierd your actually alot older that many guys that.. you know. so ur not a perv. im sorry i cant help you with the aches and pains.. maybe you should talk to a friend about this. its not embarassing everyone does it.|`|CLDFyQWzaa	My dear just know one thing.... you are totaly normal and have nothing to worry about.<br>  You body have gone used to your masturbation routine, due to this the spurm production rate in your body has increased from what it was earlier. So if you do not do it for 2 days you feel pain (when you are exicited) as the body want's to empty it out to make space for the new sperms produced.<br>  It's will not affect you but still it's not good to do it daily, for that you try to endulge in physical sports which will help you to burn off all the energy that you are storing in your body and wear loose cloths while you are in home and during sleep, it will give your organ some fresh air and it's good for it's health.<br>  <br>  Wash your organ daily with soap and use normal water, it will increase the amount of healthy spearms.<br>  AND do not do it unless you are realy excited, it can be done for pleasure but you should not do it just because it.

iM7A8wDCaa	Try to get one night of really good sleep at least once a week... That means one night of at least 12 hours sleep.<br>  <br>  if you are always busy, like getting up 6am every weekday... my tip is to try getting to bed as early as possible on the sunday. (eg. 9:30 - 10:30) It gets you ready for the monday and makes you naturally want to goto bed earlier in the week.... Which means more sleep.<br>  <br>  For you, with the high tolerance of caffeine, is just to get good sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep is the key.|`|E2aFjyPIaa	There is no such thing to avoid sleep and stay awake fresh. The more you try to fight the more you become tired later on. The best way to avoid is to get a good sleep at night. A person require a minimum of 8hrs of sleep in a day which may extend if you do physicals or mental work. The idea of microsleep is good, enjoy it for 15 minutes and you will be fresh. Dont believe in coffee, caffeine or any prep pills you wont be able to concentrate on what you are doing.

(I drink 2 pots of black coffee a day, but still feel like I need a cat-nap by mid-afternoon)  Energy drinks don't work for me either.<br>  <br>  So, I feel your pain.<br>  <br>  I used to take Zantrex 3 (it's an over-the-counter weight loss pill, I know, sounds stupid.)  It kept my weight down when I used to dance (I'm only 19, by the by) but mostly I loved the RIDICULOUS amounts of energy.  In like, 20 minutes I had hours of alertness and focus.<br>  <br>  But those pills can be dangerous.  <br>  <br>  So, maybe your diet needs a tune up.  Heavy saturated fats and salty snacks may be to blame.  I don't know your diet, so I'm only going on a guess.  Try fruits and vegetables (fresh), whole grains.  The complex carbs give you a constant release of energy. it's amazing how much food affects our bodies.<br>  <br>  Hoped this helped a little. :]|`|k91hDzu9aa	i have microsleeps alot. that means sleep. dont try to fight it, its really unhealthy for the body and mind|`|Eb1gt231aa	You should get enough sleep during the night. And remember if you don't drink enough water (not coke, not juices, not coffee ) you feel tired and dizzy especially in the afternoon . You may lack vitamins and minerals.

cd0cc274e9392150514799a2567aca21aa	Make sure you are using a slender tampon designed especially for younger girls, like Tampax Slimfits.<br>  <br>  You might want to use a dab of lubricant (such as KY Jelly, available at any drugstore) on the tip of the tampon to smooth insertion.<br>  <br>  As you insert the tampon, don't hold it straight up, angle it about 45 degrees backwards.  Be sure to relax all of your muscles. <br>  <br>  You could also try inserting them laying down on the bathroom floor.  When I was just starting my period, I had to lie down to put tampons in.  It made getting the right angle easier.<br>  <br>  Make sure that the applicator is far enough inside you before pushing the tampon in.<br>  <br>  If you are still having trouble, ask your mother or another female relative to help you (only if you feel comfortable, of course!)

Spread your vagina with one hand and insert with the other one. Some gals have to use some oil on the tip until they get used to using them and to help lubricate at first.  With practice you will be using them without a second thought.  With the position I just told you to try it is easier for you to insert and easier to let your body guide the thing in rather than trying to force it in. Once it is in correctly you should not feel anything at all.  If it hurts you it is not far enough in.  You can take your finger and give it a little bit more of a push until it is comfortable.

I lucked out because my little sister has become a personal trainer and she dosen't charge me. You might look at college and see who is working toward becoming one and they might take you on to train for little or nothing. I have been able to lose a good bit of weight and stick to a pretty good eating schedual since letting her help me. I have packed it on over the past few years. Work on changing the habit of eating when you are down to taking a walk or something. I had to quit the evening beer fest with the guys. I still have one or two from time to time but not 6-10 an evening. Good luck darlin!

I will tell you this, I am 5'5 and on the higher side of average, I usually wear a 7/8 sometimes a 5/6 and I even have one pair 9/10 in my closet, so based on personal experience I would say 15-16 is few sizes bigger than average.|`|A1jUIKp6aa	Sounds a bit overweight. What is your waist measurement as anything over 32 inches around the narrowest part of the waist is too much for 5ft6. <br>  <br>  And I'm pretty sure a size 15/16 is over a 32 inch waist unless perhaps you just have big boobs and hips but still have a smaller waist, in which case you might be okay as long as your overall body fat percentage does not exceed 30%.
AA11508016	It does sound like an allergic reaction. Allergies to something new can develop at any time in someones lifetime. <br>  Beef allergies are not that uncommon in the world of food allergies. It would not only be important to avoid all beef, but also see a board certified allergist for testing and emergency epinephrine. <br>  Right now you react in a rash, but at any time the allergy could develop into something more serious, even fatal. <br>  Avoid beef like the plague until you see an allergist.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  People absolutely CAN be allergic to apples, bananas, broccoli, rice and any other fruit, vegetable or grain. <br>  DO NOT attempt to eat all the beef you can to see if you are allergic to it. If you react from a normal portion now with a rash, the next time you have a normal portion, or worse, more than normal, you absolutely COULD potentially go into ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK! <br>  If you are allergic, every time you consume your allergen (beef), your body could and likely will, create more histamine for the allergic response (you will have a more severe reaction). Past reactions cannot dictate future reactions.<br>  Please email me, I'll walk you through it. DO NOT experiment with food allergies without an epipen in hand.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	I had the itchy red bumps but they lasted for 10 days and were horrible.<br>  When the bumps are all gone, eat apples, rice, banana, broccoli for a few days.

2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	It's possible that you are suffering from iron deficiency anemia?? Are you eating enough iron rich foods?? Other symptoms of iron deficiency anemia are  nasty nasty headaches & migraines, dizzy spells and fainting feelings and loss of balance and fatigue and exhaustion and paleness of skin .............. an easy way to check if you have iron deficiency anemia is to pull down the lower lid of your eyelids and check is coloring ......... pasty and pale is iron deficiency anemia and rich & red in coloring is healthy.<br>  <br>  Take a multi B complex supplement including all the B's ie ~ B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12 and folic acid etc.... as they work best together ........ iron needs vitamins B6, B12, calcium and vitamin D for effective assimilation .... don't buy any of the B complex of vitamins individually but rather as a whole complex as they rely on each other for effective assimilation .... a liquid form of the B complex would be easiest to assimilate ...... the B complex of vitamins is essential for healthy neural, digestive and immune system functioning and will therefore help you to manage your stress levels on a daily basis........... simply follow the instructions on the bottle.<br>  <br>  Or eat more iron rich foods such as lean red meats, spinach, egg yolks and oatmeal.<br>  <br>  Eat more foods rich in calcium and vitamin D also ie ~ leafy and green vegies (calcium) and cold water fishes such as tuna, salmon, sardines (vitamin D)............ vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin so get 10 minutes per day of safe sun exposure if you don't like fish?<br>  <br>  Drink at least 2 - 3 litres per day of fresh filtered water too ...... you'd be amazed at how being just a little dehydrated can affect your mood and energy levels.<br>  <br>  Cut right back on coffee, tea, sodas and soft drinks and alcohol too (if you drink any of these) as not only will they all dehydrate you terribly but they will also rob you of your precious B complex of vitamins.<br>  <br>  Other things that will rob you of your precious B complex of vitamins are :- stress, eating too much protein, eating too much tinned food, laxatives and diuretics, antiobiotics, antidepressants, penicillin, prednisone and aspirin, otc cold and flu medicines<br>  <br>  hope this helps a bit<br>  <br>  good health 2 u<br>  <br>  cheers<br>  ?|`|ynEdpoj8aa	You may be hypothyroid.

zeA1s3Rpaa	1) En la parte baja del hígado tenemos una bolsita que se llama  vesícula biliar, donde se forma la bilis, que es una sustancia que sirve para que el organismo pueda digerir las grasas. En ocasiones esa bilis suele cristalizarse y formar un cáculo (una piedrecilla) que se atora en el conducto que conecta la vesícula con los intestinos. Cuando el cálculo es muy peque?o, suele desatorarse cuando respiramos hondo, y produce un dolor agudo que dura unos segundos.<br>  2) El beber alcohol afecta al hígado y el fumar, a los pulmones, pero en tu caso no parece haber compromiso hepático o pulmonar.<br>  3) Te sugiero dejes de beber y de fumar, si no es posible, seguramente hay grupos de autoayuda que te servirán de mucho.<br>  Saludos.|`|4e929cf92abf444c6480335575069c69aa	Hay mas posibilidades de da?o pulmonar que de da?o hepático con el régimen de vida que tiene.El dolor abdominal puede ser por una gastritis, una ulcera gastroduodenal  o simplemente ansiedad.Vea a su medico para que sea examinado completamente y se haga un diagnostico.|`|91Lfaklaaa	y si el higado se enferma si le da al alcohol y fumar anda alguna ayuda para vos.|`|3WTxr2inaa	YO TE DARíA UN BUENA TUNDA, PALIZA O CA......DA<br>  Mocoso primero aprende a escribir, el hígado se te va a desarmar en un par de a?os por tanto alcohol, y de tanto cigarro te vas a quedar sin pulmón a los 20.

The combination of excitement and fear of premature ejaculation makes it worse. If you try and he p.e., then immediately try to get him erect again and do it again. Once he realizes that you aren't upset or going to give up on him,  he''ll respond AND once he gets used to your involvement in his sexual activity - you won't be as intimidating as you are right now (his fear of failure).    You will create a frankenstein though, in that once you "fix him" you'll have trouble ever turning him off  (he'll be like a kid with a new toy AND a new playmate).|`|UfkOQsE2aa	It can't be.  |`|bcd173d35993f0ffa9da4f1c985072e1aa	ask a doc.  it might seem embarrassing to talk about, but they deal with this kind of stuff ALL DAY LONG.  it is like nothing to them.  good luck.|`|JXsMr8UYaa	Just before he cums gently squeeze the base of his glans for a few seconds.......not with your teeth, that could have an altogether different result lol|`|7tYWqmZnaa	You can't "fix" it.

tS4t9Lndaa	That is  way TOO high. I cannot believe he ignored such a high BP. She should be concerned and ask for treatment. What's he doing waiting for her to have a stroke? That is complete negligence. This is why I write in so many of my answers and that   women's cardiac health issues are frequently ignored. She should purchase an automatic BP cuff and check it herself to be safe. If she has trouble using it just email me|`|gohSYGueaa	If there was anything to worry about the doctor would have done further tests or given her a blood pressure tablet I am sure they will continue to monitor it if it is giving cause for concern|`|eWSUUJGcaa	It's dangerous for blood pressure to be so high - 120/80 is normal, and anything over about 140/90 is considered high. But it's not right for a doctor to give treatment for high blood pressure based on a single reading.<br>  <br>  A patient must have had a high blood pressure on at least two separate occasions before they are given treatment. This is because it can rise temporarily as a result of stress, recently smoking a cigarette, exercise, having a hot bath and many other reasons.<br>  <br>  I expect your sister's doctor intends to re-test her blood pressure at least once in the near future, and then consider medication. A couple more weeks of high blood pressure won't cause any harm.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, your sister should try to lower her blood pressure by improving her lifestyle. If she reduces the amount of salt and saturated fats in her diet, loses weight (if she's overweight), and increases her exercise to at least 30 minutes of running or similar, 3 times a week, her blood pressure will get lower. And without any of the risks and side-effects of blood-pressure lowering drugs!|`|Ri8s0MrPaa	Doctors are suposed to know right, but speaking from experience, yes this is high and left untreated can cause her major problems. Sometimes blood pressures do show false readings in hot temperatures, if the patient has been rushing around, nervous and stressed. I would recommend that she makes another appointment to see the nurse to have it checked again in a weeks time to see if it has changed. The nurse should then refer her to the doctor if it is still high.|`|zp5qEJiyaa	Blood pressure this high can cause serious health problems including severe seizures, and heart problems.  I was diagnosed with high blood pressure after having a seizure (1st one in my life) and my blood pressure was 178/99.  And I continued having seizures until I got it under control, and haven't had one since.  During my 1st one I stopped breathing.   It can be very dangerous.  If her Dr. isn't worried I would get a second opinion,  Blood pressure should not be taken lightly.  It can effect the rest of your life, especially if not treated properly.  Please,  telll her to get a second opinion.   It can be gotten under control with prescription medicine as well as things like no salt diet use sea salt instead, avoid heat, avoid stress, and exercise.  High blood pressure is a silent killer.  Take it seriously please.|`|607c3c54c04f79e4f966251c8cd17fbaaa	yes she should that blood pressure is too high and prolonged high bp can lead to health problems. normal bp is aprox 120/70 give or take depending on age and underlying condtions, i would get a second opinon asap. 
xpgvB4eraa	Hey!<br>  <br>  I'm 23 and have had type one diabetes for 18 years now. The fact that your doctor wouldn't tell you anything is complete BS! Please find another doctor!<br>  <br>  69 is too low in my opinion, especially after drinking glucose! By the book, 70 is normal, and even at 70, that's almost low! It doesn't take much activity to become low. I don't even drive if I'm under 100 because I know my blood sugar level can easily drop at any time. I also don't feel low until around 60.<br>  <br>  I'm not a doctor, but it seems like you are definitely hypoglycemic, and let me give me explain why. I think you felt hyper after the first hour due to your insulin's rapid response. Insulin is why people get hyper from eating sugar. The release of insulin gives one energy, and the body's process of insulin converting sugar to fat makes people hyper, not the insulin or sugar alone. As a type one diabetic, my first sign of low blood sugar has always been being hyper. Even if the glucometer tells me I'm normal, I know I have too much insulin in me when I'm hyper. Once I'm hyper, I know I'll drop shortly. <br>  <br>  You were also probably a lot lower than 69 during your 3 hour waiting period. It seems like your body put out way too much insulin for the glucose drink. Your body goes into defense when you are low and slowly converts insulin to fat on its own, which slowly raises your blood sugar level. Therefore, if you have been having low blood sugar symptoms for years, it may explain why you are overweight. The extra amount of insulin is simply turning into fat.<br>  <br>  Again, I am NOT a doctor, and this is just my input. I hope I was able to help, and again, please find a new doctor! You clearly had signs of low blood sugar and were not attended to! I hope you feel better soon!|`|Djo00RZGaa	She couldn't say anything because your bloodsugar alone didn't tell her anything conclusive.  You were exhibiting the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  Possibly due to diabetes.  You were hypoglycemic from fasting.  You got glucose.  Your blood sugar went up.  You pancreas made too much insulin, and bonded to too much glucose.  Your blood sugar went down.  That could be due to diabetes.
fwWq2llXaa	Definately - some people do self-harm or destructive behaviors like cutting them selves or doing drugs which can lead to death or accidents.<br>  <br>  Depression can lead to suicide.<br>  <br>  Some people who have mental illness need to take medications - the meds could have serious side effect; and/or alter their functioning and could lead to an accident due to impairment<br>  <br>  Alcoholism can lead to Hepatits, liver disease and wet brain.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	It depends. It is difficult for any disease to cause a cut or a broken bone- those are injuries caused by trauma, not really physical symptmos of a disease. <br>  <br>  Some mental illnesses cause self destructive behavior. These come in several forms- some of them cause the patients to purposefully inflict self injury- like cutting. Others cause repetitive behaviors that cause unintentional injury- like an autistic child banging their head against a wall.  Still others involve behaviors that lead to unintentional illlness or injury- such as a bulimic, whos vomiting can cause severe acid damage to their teeth and esophagus. Persons with eating disorders are also at risk for heart problems and even death as a result of their extreme weight loss. <br>  <br>  The other type of mental disorder is what is called a conversion disorder. A person with this will have physical symptoms that are mentally caused. They may present with seizures for instance. They will look like seizures, the doctors often think they are seizures, and the patient really believes that they are true seizures- they have no idea that it is all caused by mental stress. I believe there are several similar disorders that cause actuall physical symptoms.<br>  <br>  And, of course, there is always munchausens- where a patient intentionally injures or sickens themselves to gain the attention and treatment of medical staff. -Neb|`|CEp2au4laa	What usually happens to me is that I'm so focus on my job that I don't realize when I got hurt, I just see my injuries at home.

mSGSLqHFaa	Yes there are recorded cases of diabetics having infertility problems if their three month average blood glucose ( glycosulated haemoglobin ) is more than 7.5 .|`|Djo00RZGaa	Nowhere that I read.  There MIGHT be a sexual complication from DKA, but I just know about the symptoms and treatment.|`|xpgvB4eraa	Hi!<br>  <br>  First of all, I want to let you know that I'm not a doctor, but this is what I have learned after having type one diabetes for 18 years.<br>  <br>  Yes, like any health problem, diabetes can interfere with conception. I'm not sure if you are diabetic, but there are risks regarding fertility and pregnancy if your blood sugar is not closely monitored before and after conception. I have no children myself, but I do know that recommended blood sugar levels are lower for both pregnant women and those trying to conceive. <br>  <br>  All women with diabetes can conceive, but it's best to make sure your health is as perfect as possible before trying to get pregnant. Many diabetic women have other hormone-related problems that can delay conception. So if you are trying to get pregnant, please talk to a doctor you trust first!<br>  <br>  All diabetics can have babies, but like non-diabetics, your health should be in good shape before conceiving. If you become pregnant before monitoring your health, it is extremely important to see a doctor ASAP! From what I know, a lot of babies from diabetic women are fine, but the mothers suffer from complications after giving birth. <br>  <br>  Also, if you want more opinions, try <a href="http://www.diabetesforums.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetesforums.com/.</a> I cannot recommend the site enough. <br>  <br>  I hope I was able to help!
s9u1VPJsaa	It's uncomfortable.  I'm a male with IC and urethral strictures and I've had MANY cystoscopies.  They will probably give you a medication that will help afterwards when you urinate so it won't burn. (at least they do that with males)  They also put a numbing jell into the urethra prior to the procedure to help numb the discomfort.  Again, I can only speak from my own experience. I wish you well!

yl1ee8BVaa	<br>  Hey buddy...six months is good enough to get ripped. But get ready for some real hard work.<br>  <br>  Here's what you can do to get ripped in six months.<br>  <br>  1. Based on your age, figure out your daily maintenance level or your Basic Metabolic Rate-  you can do this easily online.<br>  <br>  2. Your goal must be to aim for 500-750 (not more) calorie deficit each day through a combination of a healthy diet and intense exercise<br>  <br>  3. Eat your breakfast. Research shows that breakfast eaters lose more weight than those who do not.<br>  <br>  4. Eat 4 -5 meals spaced out at intervals of 3-4 hours each day. This keeps your metabolism chugging well throughout the day. In fact even increase it to 6 meals a day if you can.<br>  <br>  5. Once every week, do a high calorie or a high carb day. Give into your cravings, have that pizza slice. just to give your body a break from the dieting and help you to stay on the wagon. Don't be afraid, as you get leaner and leaner it will be important to cycle your carbs and this one technique can actually help you in staying away from a plateau.<br>  <br>  6. Exercise is ofcourse a no-brainer and an absolute must. Cardio and Weight training - both forms of exercise must be included. If you are already buff, and you only want to strip off your body fat. You must increase you cardio workouts. But make sure you do it with progression. <br>  <br>  7. Your weight training workouts are also an abolute must. Cardio without weight training will strip off muscle as well. Thats what we dont want. Go for supersets, multijoint, compound exercises - squats deadlifts, bench presses, rows. this will give you a higher metabolic boost as it works the larger muscle groups.<br>  <br>  8. Measure your current body fat percentage. Your goal must to go below 10% body fat. A six pack will really show well in the 6-8% body fat range.<br>  <br>  Stay committed and you will melt that fat away and get your ripped body<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  |`|fmHhvwFTaa	All you need is $150 to buy p90x.

When you move around, more blood gets to your brain and causes better feelings.<br>  -if you have aches and pains in your body, sometimes it shows up us moodiness.<br>  -an overactive thyroid or high blood pressure can cause tantrums and irritability<br>  <br>  Emotional problems:<br>  -you may have repressed anger<br>  -you may have a personality crisis and are not sure what you want and how to deal with everything. talking abou that with a counsellor or a doctor will help<br>  -ask a doctor about symptoms of bi-polar personality<br>  -you may not be satisfied with your life. Find  ways  to be happy about what you have and to be happy to be alive.<br>  -if you're under 20, then your hormones are acting out, but will subside.

6557893b8d2dbb4693ec3b16ddef64dbaa	Did you have your large toe bone cut and set so it would be more parallel with your other toe bones, as well as having the bump removed? I had that type of surgery, called a Mitchell osteotomy, 36 years ago, on both feet. It was done by an orthopedic surgeon. I did not have screws put in at all. I wore walking casts for about three weeks, as I recall. I don't remember any swelling.<br>  Are you keeping your feet elevated a lot? <br>  How long ago was your initial bunion surgery, and why were screws added? If your metatarsal bone isn't healing the doctor might be able to use electrical stimulation to help it heal. I see from other discussions of this that doctors often remove the screws.<br>  <br>  <paragraph below, from podiatrynetwork.com article><br>  Possible Complications<br>  Complications following bunion surgery are uncommon but may include infection, suture reaction, delayed or nonunion of the osteotomy, irritation from the pin or screws, stiff joint or recurrence of the deformity. Recurrence of the deformity can be halted or slowed with the use of functional foot orthotics. It is important to realize that surgery does not correct the cause of the bunion deformity. Functional foot orthotics however do address the cause of the deformity and their use are strongly encouraged following bunion surgery.<br>

How long have you been feeling like this?  Typically, a diagnosis of depression would be made if a person was experiencing many of the symptoms you've described, much of the time, for at least two weeks straight.<br>  <br>  From the sound of it, you may be suffering from an anxiety disorder, too.  <br>  <br>  For a definitive diagnosis, you should talk to your doctor, or a trusted adult who can help you get help.  However, as someone who has dealt with depression and anxiety, I KNOW how hard it can be to reach out for help.  There are several good online tests you can take to evaluate the severity of your symptoms - check the site below for a list of them.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you do determine you are suffering from depression and/or anxiety, remember it is an illness, just like high blood pressure or diabetes (or any other), and can be treated!  You can feel better!!  <br>  <br>  Please make sure you reach out to get help. You deserve to be excited about life again.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Patricia C.

It is the sensation of spinning or swaying while the body is actually stationary with respect to the surroundings.<br>  <br>  There are two types of vertigo: subjective and objective. There is a subjective vertigo when a person has a false sensation of movement. In the case of objective vertigo, the surroundings appear to move past a person's field of vision.<br>  <br>  The effects of vertigo may be slight. It can cause nausea and vomiting and, in severe cases, it may give rise to difficulties with standing and walking.<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Causes <br>  2 Neurochemistry <br>  3 Diagnostic testing <br>  4 Treatment <br>  5 References <br>  6 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Causes<br>  Vertigo is usually associated with a problem in the inner ear balance mechanisms (vestibular system), in the syndrome]] and Meniere's disease.<br>  <br>  Vertigo-like symptoms may also appear as paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) in the form of opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, a multi-faceted neurological disorder associated with many forms of incipient cancer lesions or viruses.<br>  <br>  Vertigo is typically classified into one of two categories depending on the location of the damaged vestibular pathway. These are peripheral or central vertigo. Each category has a distinct set of characteristics and associated findings.<br>  <br>  Vertigo can also occur after long flights or boat journeys where the mind gets used to turbulence, resulting in a person's feeling as if he is moving up and down. This usually subsides after a few days.<br>  <br>  Vertigo can also occur when exposed to high levels of sound pressure rattling the inner ear in which throwing off ones balance.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Neurochemistry<br>  The neurochemistry of vertigo includes 6 primary neurotransmitters that have been identified between the 3-neuron arc that drives the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Many others play more minor roles.<br>  <br>  Three neurotransmitters that work peripherally and centrally include glutamate, acetylcholine, and GABA.<br>  <br>  Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons, and may modulate synaptic transmission in all 3 neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. GABA is thought to be inhibitory for the commissures of the medial vestibular nucleus, the connections between the cerebellar Purkinje cells and the lateral vestibular nucleus, and the vertical VOR.<br>  <br>  Three other neurotransmitters work centrally. Dopamine may accelerate vestibular compensation. Norepinephrine modulates the intensity of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. Histamine is present only centrally, but its role is unclear. It is known that centrally acting antihistamines modulate the symptoms of motion sickness.<br>  <br>  The neurochemistry of emesis overlaps with the neurochemistry of motion sickness and vertigo. Acetylcholine, histamine, and dopamine are excitatory neurotransmitters, working centrally on the control of emesis. GABA inhibits central emesis reflexes. Serotonin is involved in central and peripheral control of emesis but has little influence on vertigo and motion sickness.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Diagnostic testing<br>  Tests of vestibular system (balance) function include electronystagmography (ENG), rotation tests, Caloric reflex test,[2] and Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP).<br>  <br>  Tests of auditory system (hearing) function include pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, acoustic-reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and auditory brainstem response test (ABR; also known as BER, BSER, or BAER).<br>  <br>  Other diagnostic tests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized axial tomography (CAT or CT).<br>  <br>  |`|xpgISLqRaa	Its a dizziness or dioriented state of mind, you feel like everythings in a whirl and you aren't as aware of your surroundings.

vbIfbwJRaa	In order to get your legs in shape, I'd stick with the treadmill (running) and add some squats and lunges.   Machines aren't always the answer, actually using free weights and your own body weight is more effective.  Stay consistant...5 days of exercise a week, with a day of rest inbetween lifting days.  How long it takes is completely dependent on your body type, age, and metabolism. <br>  <br>  Also remember your diet has a lot to do with it too...eat healthy!|`|wAUDXhRJaa	The road is your best machine...<br>  <br>  Go outside and run...<br>  <br>  And it takes time, lots, so if you aren't the dedicated type you might have problems... you need to run, run, run, and run, till you want to puke... and then wake up the next day and do it again...<br>  <br>  It's about hard work and dedication
kby1ksuraa	There really is no "cure" for hpv/genital warts; since it's a virus it supposedly stays in your system forever.  I have heard though, that your immune system can get rid of it...it really all just depends.  The genital warts are more so "treatable", but HPV is the virus that caused them..so that's what stays in your system.  I found out I had HPV/Genital warts in June and was prescribed Aldara cream.  I was told to apply it every other night before bed and then to wash it off in the morning when I woke up.  I honestly did this for about a week and a half and they were gone.  I didn't have a severe case, just a small cluster but the cream did wonders for me.  If you have genital warts they will probably have you try the cream first, if that doesn't work there are other treatment possibilities such as laser treatment, getting them frozen off like normal warts or even surgery.  Those are usually only used in severe cases.  Hope this helped and good luck!|`|O6x1CTd4aa	If your immune system is going to get rid of it it can take up to 3 years but if your immune system doesn't kick it there is no medical cure only treatments|`|U9m33PMOaa	1 in 5 adult have STD. you can get the correct answer at STDromance.com

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?

I don't know that you are but it sounds like that might be a possibility.  Think of it this way; what you get back from others is a reflection of what you put forth yourself.  It's like looking in a mirror.  If you are projecting that you are a miserable person, no one is going to want to be around you and you are going to get the feeling that no one is supporting you -- because they aren't.  Look in the mirror; if there is a problem, it's probably you that is causing the problem.  |`|a45iwRy8aa	Lol you will have to remember that you are your best friend.

Try and chalk this out. Then work on it and I'm sure u will improve and get out of this problem. You will meet lots of people in this world having different views and suggestions but it's You finally who's gonna make the decision. |`|7srTqyjgaa	You sound exactly like me.  I am the same way, I have no friends, my family doesn't support me, we don't even talk, so I don't know if they have any idea.  I see a therapist, but I can't talk to him. I'm too shy, and desperately suicidal, but he doesnt see my subtleties. I think no one can openly support you because they are afraid that they will lose you.  I know that makes no sense, but they ignore the problem and deny it.  Also, they might now know what to do.  You need to tell them what you need and that you have a serious problem.  They don't want to lose you.  You just need to make them listen.  |`|itWQfuIqaa	How old are you? If you are under, say 20 years old then try to know that life can improve over the next few years just because your brain grows and gets more able to handle things/stresses. It's so hard no matter what your age if you feel so low about yourself and the future. <br>  For the moment try to do something that will help you feel comfortable, listen to soothing music, draw, even try to do mild exercise! If you are not being helped by talking to your counselor you should let him/her know, sometimes a change of approach will help, Read Marcia Linehan books on coping with depressed feelings. She encorages keeping a journel too. Might anti-depressants be something to try? They have helped me.<br>  I hope you find ways to feel better soon. Doctors/therapists can really help
8026f858400be8d2c8e3b384ce4fe4bfaa	Skin tags are tiny flesh coloured, finger-like projections on the skin. They tend to arise completely spontaneously, although they can occur where there is unsatisfactory healing of a wound. They are often multiple and tend to increase in numbers as the years go by, and the elastic tissue in the skin is lost. They are not cancerous in any way and are merely unsightly and capable of becoming infected if they are traumatized by clothing which rubs against them. <br>  <br>  One treatment involves tying their base very tightly with a piece of cotton and then waiting for them to drop off as the blood supply is obstructed and the skin tag dies naturally. This method, however, can lead to infection. An alternative and that is much more effective would be diathermy. This basically involves destroying them using a heated probe that would require either local anaesthetic or a special anaesthetic cream called EMLA cream to numb the areas of skin first.

yuseVVPBaa	nope i dont even understand why people use that word.Well when you lose the fat covering the muscle your muscles shows up since it cant hide.you cant tone muscle.|`|uHoHChl9aa	Of course you can, how can a word be a myth, its saying the word 'buff' is a myth.<br>  Its just another word to describe the aesthetics of a person's body, "well toned stomach", "strong toned legs".

JTI2Pmkaaa	maybe "perfect"?<br>  <br>  I think that, in my personal opinion (hehe^^), the word toned means muscular but not too much. Just so that when you show your bare arms you can see the lines of the muscles. Am I totally lost? :S|`|h2kMk88faa	Toned mean ripped and lean. A woman who does cardio daily, strenght training 3 times a week and eats moderatey clean, will have a toned body.

Not muscular but not carrying any excess fat. THAT is a toned body. But, it's a mater of symantics. If you don't like the word, use another instead.|`|uHoHChl9aa	Toning is what people do if they don't want to look like weight lifters and they don't want to be skin and bone its in between. <br>  They want to keep fit and they want a nice hard flat stomach and good muscle definition on their legs and arms. <br>  There is definitely a use for the word 'toned'.|`|XSXdMu0caa	no fat, a lean body no wobbly bits|`|0RgIOLOLaa	Its when you are built, not too bulky built just a bit.

You may not wish to gain muscle mass just strengthen what you already have, Look at martial artists who are toned as anything but not huge muscly guys. If I don't work out for a few months I don't loose the muscle it just becomes a bit flaccid and limp, two months of training a lot of lower weights but more reps and I'm toned again.|`|hE7fK4W0aa	ok well say u lose weight and have saggy skin u are deffo not small and lean ... and u are deffo not toned!! <br>  <br>  If u lose weight and exercise then u tone up ...
s0fd48mMaa	First of all your not fat. Your weight is normal for your height. I wish people would stop worrying about how much they weigh, especially if you're healthy. But I also feel that daily excerise is important. Run. It's the fastest way to tone up. Start running 1 mile a day and every week increase your milage by 1/4 of a mile...until you get to about 3 miles. Try to run every single day. Or at least 5 times a week. As long as you do this, eat healthy, and drink water you are on the right track.
LfE8fUnDaa	Depends on what you have to do later today.  I've done what you're pondering before (just kept myself up), and I was OK for a few hours, but after that I was a mess.  So unless you just have a to take a 1-2 hour test in 4 hours and then you can come home and go to sleep, I would advise against it.  <br>  <br>  If you have 4 hours, I would just set your 5 alarms (set the loudest one as loud as possible), go to sleep, and hope for the best.  That's enough time for sleep that I would suggest just taking the power nap.  If it's too important for you to wake up in 4 hours and you really don't want to risk it, then lots of coffee/energy drinks should do the trick.  You'll probably have to keep drinking coffee to stay up later today too though.|`|KOfxqaApaa	WELL I DRINK RED BULL AND IT MAKES ME VERY AWAKE!!! Usually I would type like this.

I would also assume you have started your period, and the body retains more water before your periods, resulting in some temporary weight gain.<br>  <br>  All in all, you shouldn't be freaking out over your weight.

nqXJ9SGXaa	60 pounds is a good amount of weight. I'd estimate roughly 3-4 months depending on dedication and commitment to a program. I do not know what you look like, but if you want some motivation, take a picture of yourself right now. put it somewhere..and when you know you are trying to cheat your way out of working out 1 day or eating something you dont think you should be, go look at that picture and remind yourself thats what that stuff got you..because after you give in and have one...one becomes two..two becomes three...three becomes well obviously i can have them and its okay. but its not.

Exercise is really important, it will help you look better, feel better, it reduces stress and helps you keep clear skin lol.  As for food, it's best to just to do your best to have 3 solid meals a day, or however many meals work for you, but my general rule of thumb is to never feel starving... a little hungry is ok, but thats probably when you should eat!  <br>  <br>  Hope this wasnt too much.|`|IjxyGwubaa	One of the main ingredients of losing weight is to make sure you have good nutritious food. If you do not feed your body it goes into starvation mode as it doesn't know where the next meal is coming from. There are some things you can do if you wish to lose those extra inches and get into better shape. Losing weight can sometimes be a matter of just changing your normal eating habits to a healthier diet combined with better nutrition.<br>  <br>  For instance your healthy way of eating becomes your healthy lifestyle.<br>  <br>  A balanced diet is essential to provide your body with all the nutrients to make it function properly. Sometimes according to national statistics we make the wrong decisions and find making healthy choices a challenge.<br>  <br>  Here are just a few key points to optimise your health.<br>  a) you need a balanced diet with colourful fruits and vegetables, lean protein, good carbohydrates and the right amount of good fats.<br>  b) vitamins, minerals and fibre to provide the nitrition missing from your diet that your body needs for good health.<br>  c) regular exercise to condition your heart, relieve stress and to make it easier to maintain a healthy body weight.<br>  d) lastly, try to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day, excluding tea and coffee.<br>  <br>  There are 2 options that may be of interest to you,<br>  <br>  I'm fairly slim but like you there was unwanted flesh around my middle, I weighed just under 11 stone.

There is no definitive time scale. People can live 10 years or more with terminal cancer, where as some will only survive weeks or months.

At this stage, it is treatable, often for many years, but it is not curable. Like normal breast cells, these tumors in the bone often thrive on female hormones, especially estrogen. Therefore treatment with medicines that lower estrogen levels may be prescribed.<br>  For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer.

No one not even a doctor knows when a patient will die . . all this would mean is that eventually the disease may kill her . . may is the operative word . . no one knows with any certainty at all. But that is only if your mother stays in treatment, some patients decide that they do not want to continue treatment and than their cancer will be terminal. But if your mother stays in treatment and responds well than she may go into remission for an undetermined amount of time . . or more and more doctors are looking for treatment that will control the progress of the cancer, slow it down, and allow your mother to live for an undetermined amount of time . . and still have quality of life. Eventually . . and no one knows when . . the cancer could claim her life . . or not . . if she can live with her cancer being controlled at some point medical science may come up with a more effective treatment and she would still be alive to take it. So, a patient that has advanced disease has some tough choices . . to either decide not to pursue treatment or to fight with everything they've got to stay alive with the hope that more treatment options will become available.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

nxzPUrHKaa	Your Body wants n Craves Fats n Carbs 24/7<br>  <br>  Its the way in which your body eats n processes food.<br>  <br>  So if you were to feed your body, Protein to start with (More filling as well as harder to digest) your body will be working harder, therefore increasing your metabolism, making you burn more unwanted fat in the same amount of time you would be normally. Not to mention your body would still want those Fats n Carbs, hence the reason it will eats its own storage (BODY FAT).<br>  <br>  So one goal here is to eat more meat. (I hope you arent a Vegetarian).<br>  Now with snacking n Soft Drinks etc.<br>  Go for the low cal Coke etc. Not the Diet, but the Coke Zero.<br>  Same Taste, no Cals.<br>  <br>  The key to feeling full, is to eat Low GI foods. Notice after you eat Oatmeal, you feel full for at least a couple of hours n yet if you eat high Processed stuff, you want more 30mins later.<br>  <br>  Low GI (Gycemic Index) food are slow releasing into the body. Meaning they are giving you energy slowly throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Whats to say, you cant have a Protein Shake n Some Oatmeal for Morning n Afternoon tea? (I always eat that, when training to cut Bodyfat)<br>  That way, you wont have to eat as much for Lunch n dinner.<br>  <br>  Im sure you would have heard 6small meals is better than 3 big ones.<br>  <br>  So Eating frequently is the one thing you need to do.<br>  <br>  Water!!! Ever heard the Expression, "The More you Drink, The More you Shrink"?<br>  <br>  Water all the time is the best bet!<br>  <br>  Whenever I want to eat smaller amount of Cals I Drink a glass or two of water before My Meals. Therefore feeling fuller n eating less.<br>  <br>  Lunch n Dinner should be a source of Protein n a source of Veges.<br>  Chicken breast without the skin n Brocoli are the healthier options.<br>  <br>  To make things a lil easier.<br>  <br>  Breakfast (You have it sorted, although some Egg Whites would be good as well, as its a high source of protein). Water<br>  <br>  Morning Tea:<br>  Cottage Cheese on Crackers (Cottage Cheese-High in Protein, n good to fill a void), Water<br>  <br>  Lunch: Chicken Breast n Veges or a Chicken Salad, Water<br>  <br>  Afternoon Tea: a couple of pieces of Fruit n Water<br>  <br>  Dinner: same as Lunch or some other Protein Sources...eg, Salmon, Tuna, Steak and veges, not forgetting the water<br>  <br>  Other Notes.........<br>  <br>  Portion Sizes:<br>  Breakfast should be of Medium Size<br>  Lunch the Biggest Meal of the Day<br>  Dinner the Smallest<br>  Snack throughout the day (Healthy ofcourse)<br>  Drink Lots n Enjoy what you eat.<br>  <br>  Always change it up, making it interesting. People get bored when it comes to food. Spice it up a lil.<br>  <br>  A good way to keep yourself sane is to reward yourself.<br>  <br>  Moday to Saturday, Eat Healthy, and on Sunday Eat Whatever you want!<br>  If need be, go and have a Big Fry Up on the Sunday n then go Shopping for your weeks groceries straight after. It will accomplish two things.<br>  One, you will get all the food needed for the week.<br>  and Two, you wouldve already fulfilled any void to eat bad foods, resulting in you turning a blind eye to the confectionary aisle.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)

BltbPsZBaa	Don't worry. From what you've written, this is perfectly normal. Although you might have a little something called "Protective-Girlfriend-Syndrome". ;)<br>  <br>  If you are getting really scared and suspicious about your boyfriend, sit down with him and explain your feelings. Tell him about your fears and show him this question. Just be careful to tell him that you really do love him and that you just need some help getting over this "paranoia".<br>  You two could settle things once and for all and perhaps even learn new things about each other. <br>  <br>  The point is, try rebuild the trust you two had and get on with your relationship - paranoia-free.<br>  <br>  Even going to a counselor could help. You could talk to your counselor whenever you feel anxious about your boyfriend, and they can help you through tough times too. Having a counselor can prove beneficial in situations like these.<br>  <br>  Just whatever you do, don't lose your faith in your boyfriend. Imagine what it would be like for him. How would you like it if you found out that your boyfriend didn't trust you at all? It is pretty unpleasant to be accused of something you didn't do. <br>  So be very careful with the wording if you talk to him about this, and explain that you know that you can trust him and that you know he isn't being unfaithful to you.<br>  <br>  The best of luck to you and your boyfriend.

But extreme, and irrational jealousy and being too suspicious could be a problem. As it could affect your relationship with the one you love. Coz if your boyfriend will notice that you are sneakily spying on him, or if you constantly tells him that he might be cheating on you, he might think that you don't trust him. He might find you to be irrationaly jealous. That could push him away from you. When you love someone, you need to learn how to trust. Just be the best girlfriend you can be, express your love for him and he would appreciate that . When he sees how lovable you are, I don't think he would cheat on you.<br>  <br>  Paranoia is a deeper condition, associated with psych cases. Usually marked by unreasonably suspicious thoughts , delusions and aggression.|`|061ee6e08987576acfe02eff8b79ac89aa	No sounds pretty normal to me :) but you should stop freaking out cos your friends are right I'm sure and you don't want to loose him if you love him so much so just relax :)|`|1JSblCBsaa	Jealousy, trust issues and low self esteem.

O8abrV6Vaa	Dont get discouraged, all injuries take time to heal. My advice on ur achilles is to return it to activity slowly day by day-kind of physical therapy. Try calf raises and long walks instead of jogging just yet. |`|4616e6872522fb5cbacd64d44c8873a4aa	This sounds like a tendinopathy. You should try and see a physiotherapist and also get an assessment from a specialist running shop regarding your trainers. It could be that you just need new shoes and its easily sorted. If not a physiotherapist can show you stretchess and offer you treatment for it.

I wouldn't join one of those sites because some of them are owned and operated by the DEA, and when you do buy them you are not paying realistic prices you are paying the street value prices. I don't think anyone should have to hurt, but if you hurt that bad then you should tell your doctor and if he doesn't give you anythings then get a new doctor. At least that is what I would do. Another thing is some of those sites will write you a script based on a questionnaire and phone conference but most pharmacies will red flag an out of state script and not fill it. Another thing to consider is some of those sites want you to send them MRI reports and if you have one then you should be able to get something from your doctor.

Its a relatively quick proceedure with few complications. Once the surgeory is done, they will keep you in for observation and monitor bleeding - everyone's different but there shouldnt be a great lot although you may find that you will cough up a clot (where the blood has settles down your throat) - this is normal. Also you won't be able to leave until you have eaten something, sounds evil but its usually toast! You may experience some discomfort for the next week, swallowing is likely to be sore until the swelling goes down and all they are likely to prescribe is paracetamol depending on your medical history. Overall its a worthwhile proceedure as all 3 of us used to suffer terribly from tonsilitus on a regular basis. <br>  <br>  You shouldnt be worried at all, the NHS are well equipped for this very simple op.

I know that telling you to calm down and not stress about it is not gonna help, but I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely not possible to gain 5 (real) pounds in one night unless you ate 17500 Calories! which is impossible! So maybe you drank a lot of water or something.<br>  God bless you. I hope one day you will find the strength to fight your eating disorder. I know how it feels like, to obsess about every pound you gain, it can be quite maddening. Just keep fighting, and know that you are beautiful no matter how much you weigh.

Many soups are salty (have lots of sodium) which causes fluid retention. Drink plenty of fluids today and the weight should go down|`|K5IOSGXAaa	It is probably just water, you ate two very salty items.|`|kdSuwt8paa	I think you have to make up your mind not to weigh yourself more than once a week.    Weigh yourself before breakfast every Saturday say.    That will give you a better idea of your progress.    5lbs does seem to be more than the normal variation from day to day - especially with such a tiny amount of food.    I would suspect the scales!!  Good luck.   I am sure you will get on top of your problem.

K4lRi1fjaa	G'day Jen D,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  It might be exercise induced nausea which results from over exertion during exercise or too sudden a finish to exercise. You might want to speak with a doctor or trainer about it about what you can do differently. It can also be triggered by foods or medication after exercise.<br>  <br>  Better Health Victoria suggests that you seek medical advice about the condition. <br>  <br>  I have attached sources for your reference.<br>  Regards
7TBTqgYmaa	when you eat less than 1,200 calories a day, you put your body in "starvation mode". when you put your body in that mode, your body knows you are not getting enough food so it stores all of the fat from the food you eat. so that might be the reason. your body might be storing the fat because it is not getting enough calories. you should calculate your daily calorie intake to maintain your current weight, then take that number and subtract 500. if you do that and exercise, you should lose 1 pound per week. if you want to lose more than that, subtract a little bit more than 500, but i wouldn't advise you to eat less than 1200 calories a day.<br>  <br>  <br>  i  hope i helped!|`|C3NjlziGaa	Sometimes it's not about how many calories/carbs you're consuming, but which ones exactly... <br>  lean meats like chicken and salmon are great (salmon is good for your skin too! Bonus!!)<br>  a lot of fruits and vegetables, and raw materials such as almonds, raw soups (great recipes if you google "raw soup"). <br>  <br>  walking is a great start for exercising; make sure you're getting your heart rate up if you want to start seeing results.<br>  <br>  check out the book Skinny ***** to learn more about what's really in the foods you eat!
6o4iqjPgaa	u can... but its very unhealthy!<br>  see what happens is that ur boddy starts feeding itself with the body fat but as soon as thats gone it starts making everything u eat into body fat to eat later, and it starts eating muscle too|`|dqszKQfBaa	Most people that starve themselves go back to their poor eating habits, and gain more weight in the end. That's why starvation is ineffective in the long run. And celebrities have personal trainers and dietitians, they don't all starve themselves. And plus they constantly struggle with their weight too.|`|KWENGfsjaa	they eat..they do. lol. they just sAY they are starving.<br>  <br>   when you starve yourself, your body goes into this mode where it starts conserving whatever you DO eat and what not so that if you do starve, it can call up that reserve(also known as FAT). It's not healthy to starve yourself, but it is probably healthier to eat smaller, nutritious portions. <br>  <br>  everyday people that starve themselves are anorexic or bulimic. either way, it's not healthy your body needs SOME nutrients and calories to survive. <br>  <br>  To recap, you don't lose weight because your body goes into the "store whatever comes in" mode. that's about as all I can say for you.|`|EfEqtdtTaa	When you stop eating completely, you metabolism drastically slows down, therefore you dont metabolise food as quickly and it stays in your body. Obviously if you eat only a few hundred calories a day you will lose a lot of weight because you have no nourishment, but its very harmful.|`|xpQlzgkmaa	you can lose weight by starving yourself but it is highly uneffictive you lose way more weight by excersising like jogging, sit ups, and squats. to burn calories in your legs, thighs and abs|`|iOE9EYVLaa	Thats called anorexia sweetie. <br>  <br>  Not good for you.|`|QyQ6XoLbaa	You CAN lose weight by starving.  By losing muscle, water weight, energy, and brain function.  Think concentration camp or anorexia.<br>  <br>  When they mean you can't lose weight by starving yourself, it's because the body goes into "Starvation mode" by lowing the metabolism and this retaining as much weight as possible.  Starving only shoots your metabolism to pieces, making it much harder to lose weight once you actually start eating again.  And of course you will have to eat or else you will die, simple as that.<br>  <br>  So yes, starving yourself will eventually get you thin, though it will harm your body and may make you even heavier in the long run.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't advise it.|`|TbXz21fLaa	Well, not really they over due exercising and just drink a lot of water, in reality you need Calories just to have energy, no energy no life, so when you run low on energy your body will conserve it the best way it knows how, to gain wight and feed of the fat, if you do try the starvation diet (inadvisable) you would have to do it to the point to death.|`|H5tLqifKaa	because when you starve yourself, you will have the urge to eat more than not starving and celebrities do not eat because they stop themselves to eat|`|1NE6LhGxaa	hydroxycut hardcore.... !
xRQAsGRAaa	Hydroxycut does work, but be careful with it because it is very powerful. Although I always recommend a good diet and exercise before taking these pills, I have had a few people who insist on taking it, and they see results with it. Just be careful not to take too much because the side effects can be very dramatic.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	yes they absolutely work.  They supress your appetite and they do speed up your metabolism.  You will lose weight when you use them appropriately.<br>  <br>  But lets be honest about what they are and who should use them.  They are NOT a miracle pill.  They really shouldn't be used by anybody who isn't already eating and exercising properly.  If you don't have your diet and activity under control, the Hydroxycuts will either not work or you will gain the weight right back.  They are best used when trying to get over a diet plateau instead of as a diet option.<br>  <br>  There may be some concerns about people who are in poor cardio health.|`|e5YcYnpdaa	It works if you take it and workout with it... make sure to drink a lot of water and follow the instructions. <br>  <br>  As for side effects... Sometimes i'd be a bit shaky in the mornings, you definitely get more energy and I noticed that with cardio I could run from  a longer period of time when I was taking it (it might have been the placebo effect but I don't think so). I also took hydroxicut hardcore after normal hydroxicut and I sweat a lot more than normal when running. Another side effect is your wallet will be a little more crunched. I wouldn't reccommend it if you don't plan on working out while taking it since the results will be minimal. I'd say its worth a shot though.|`|nxzPUrHKaa	Pretty Good Product<br>  <br>  Providing you are in the Cutting up phase of a program where you are on reduced calorie intake, moderate cardio n have your metabolic rate kicking pretty high.<br>  You'll notice more energy n awareness. Kind of like having 5-6cups of coffee.<br>  <br>  Side Effects?<br>  I didnt really notice anything except I was incredibly thirsty.<br>  It does say to Drink alot anyways, so as long as you do that, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  I think any of the cutting products are final touch ups, after you've shed most of the body fat n have developed more than enough muscle mass. The more muscle you have, the more ripped you'll look:)<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|s3E2qPvjaa	Not sure yet. I started taking it a couple days ago (the powdered form) and although I don't have a scale I think I am seeing some results. Then again I am very skinny to begin with and I just want to lose 2-3 pounds before spring break. I'll let you know how it goes in about a week.
QQ324JKXaa	Well, more than just exercise, dancing helps a  world. I was dancing for a play for 2 weeks straight every day at least 4 hours a day and I lost 30 pounds in those two weeks (and I had to win them back cause then I was underweight >.>). Anyway, exercise mostly just makes the fat in the body harden more than disappear, so you need to do a lot of cardio so the fat will burn, and then go to a gym or something so you can tone up ^_^|`|WhMUCXy0aa	use acai, eat less, eat healthier, and exercise more

Believe me!<br>  <br>  I quit 4 years ago after smoking for more that 40 years. I started when young because it was a "grownup" thing to do!<br>  <br>  Since I stopped I've saved $12,000 that I haven't spent on smoking! Even that was reason enough to stop without the health benefits.<br>  <br>  I stopped "cold turkey" and I still think it's the best way to stop. I've had so many friends who have tried cutting down, patches, lozenges, all sorts of things. I've tried everything, including hypnotherapy,and acupuncture. Only cold turkey worked for me.<br>  <br>  I feel so much healthier since I stopped, although I have damaged parts of my body beyond repair with smoking. I'll get to those later.<br>  <br>  When I get anywhere near a smoker now I almost puke! The smell is disgusting. It's on their breath, in their skin, their hair, their clothes, yuk! I think, "OMG, I used to smell like that"! It really is gross. That in itself should be enough to stop anyone from smoking.<br>  <br>  I stopped because one of my oldest friends phoned 4 years ago and told me that he'd just had 2 heart attacks in a week and had been operated on and had stents fitted to his arteries to stop them from closing up. Cigarette smoking had caused his arteries to almost close and it shut off the blood supply to his heart. I stopped that night!<br>  <br>  Now I'd like to give a list of people I've known and loved that have died from cigarette smoking.<br>  <br>  My father-in-law was the first. He had his leg amputated above the knee because of gangrene in his foot and leg caused by smoking. I was helping dress his leg before the amputation and it was disgusting. It used to get infected with maggots and I had to pick them out before dressing his wound. I used to throw up every time. After about 3 months on crutches he had heart attack and died because of the strain of walking on one leg.<br>  <br>  The next was my beloved mother-in-law who died from lung cancer caused by smoking.<br>  <br>  A neighbor died from emphysema caused by smoking. we helped nurse her, too. It was pathetic to see her gasping fro breath and connecting up to her portable oxygen tank.<br>  <br>  My father died from pancreatic cancer, the doctors said from smoking.<br>  A guy around the corner who was also a friend and a smoker died from a heart attack after having gangrene in his foot and having it removed.<br>  <br>  2 friends of mine have emphysema and can't walk more than 50 yards without sitting down and gasping for breath.<br>  <br>  Sam. another friend was told 2 years ago, stop smoking or lose both legs.<br>  <br>  His wife is in and out of hospital having veins removed, tubes down from her hips into her legs, continual leg ulcers, a leg cancer, she was told stop smoking or have a leg removed.<br>  <br>  I have what is called "smoker's foot". It is gross. My ankle is red, swollen, looks disgusting, I get continual ulcers on it and leg ulcers are THE most painful thing imaginable. I can't go to the beach, I'm so embarrassed about my foot, I have to have my legs covered at all times unless I'm at home. The worst thing is that probably within a couple of years my foot and leg will have to be removed up to the knee.<br>  <br>  All this because of smoking! Can you understand why it's still legal?<br>  <br>  My wife still smokes. I try to tell her as I try to tell lots of folk, but they don't listen!<br>  <br>  I really hope you do. I have a daughter who's never smoked and one who gave up, thank goodness.<br>  <br>  Please stop. For your own sake and for the sake of your loved ones.
7sVVimUCaa	Any chemical treatments made to mask the drugs show up and make the test count as an immediate positive.

It won't do anything, and B. it looks more suspicious when they see you have extremely dilute urine.

Whilst he did not come close to *finishing* they still secrete a little bit of sperm when they are aroused, so there is every chance you could have some sperm inside you. However, there is also every chance you could be fine.<br>  <br>  It would be safest to get the morning after pill, but it's up to you. If it would be really bad to get pregnant it would be worth it to make sure. Also, there aren't really any bad side effects. There are obviously things in the leaflet that say this could happen, but the chances are very small. Also even if he did *finish* the chances of actually getting pregnant are surprisingly low! As in it's not 100% and often not even 50% but it all depends on what stage of cycle you may be at etc.
UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

For some people it is more and for some it is less. The range is probably 3 weeks to 6 weeks. I would make sure to stick to your running plan. I started running 2 miles a day and noticed more muscle in about 3 1/2 weeks. Once you start running a lot though try to extend your distances and make new goals. For example now i am running close to 30 miles a week at 6 days a week. But always stick to your goal; if you are lazy and miss a day or too it doesn't help. You need to be consistent. Well, i hope this helps if you need any more advice or anything you can contact me.|`|OiHpMlOhaa	here is the fact:<br>  You have not gained the weight at once so you can not lose it at once. Everything will happen slowly. Try keep running regulary. You will certainly lose the weight. You can not judge yourself whether you have lost or not. So keep measuring the vaist and weight yourself after 15-25 days. Do not lose the patience. All the best!

There might not be a bump on your head but inflammation of the injured area that causes the pain will exist for 2 to 3 days.

Genital warts is also very contagious, just skin to skin contact can pass the virus.  Unfortunately, it sounds like you are stuck with HPV.  This isn't that bad of an STD though, the symptoms can clear on their own...you just have to be careful and try not to spread it.  |`|YyJ6mZfraa	Yeah, the virus never goes away.

7rPqP9w7aa	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. HPV is primarily transmitted by sexual contact. While some people develop warts in the genital region after infection, others experience no symptoms. From my experince wartrol is by far the best treatment for genital warts. it doesnt only remove the warts it also help your immune system to kickoff the virus. you can learn more infor here: <a href="http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=830371" rel="nofollow">http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=830371</a>|`|56txtmLVaa	Natural approaches are the only way, and even then it takes years.

There are other ways, but I believe this is the quickest and the safest, others involve using oxygen/silver in a certain way to achieve total detoxification.|`|kby1ksuraa	HPV is a virus and they say that you cannot cure a virus.  I've heard that your body can fight off the virus, but I am not sure how true this is.  Some people will have HPV and never even know it because they do not show any symptoms and their tests come up normal.  If you do show signs such as genital warts, there are many treatment options and after using one they may go away and never come back again.  That doesn't mean that you still do not have the HPV virus though.  HPV can be spread very easily, that's why it is the #1 STD today.  Many people show no symptoms, especially men and there is also no real way to test men for HPV.  Some people are only carriers of the virus and never show any symptoms.  Others will show symptoms but they can show up as soon as 2 weeks and as late as years and years after being exposed.  Even if you use a condom, you can still expose someone to HPV.  All you need is skin to skin contact and you can give it to another person.  so just because you didn't have sex, doesn't mean you didn't pass it on.  So all in all, if you have HPV/genital warts make sure your protect yourself, get yourself treated, hope it never comes back and make sure...please make sure that if you do know you have it...you let your partners know!!!!|`|gBxW2kHUaa	I work in a clinic called Women's Health Services. We only deal with STDs and other female issues. Because of this we see a lot of patients with HPV. The cryo will not help with the external warts, but is a great treatment for the cervix. HPV used to be thought of as a lifelong STD, however it is now proven that 80% of people fight it off with their immune system. The best advice I have for you is to boost your immune system with diet, exercise, and vitamins. Wear condoms, but remember that warts can be spread just by the skin shedding onto your skin. Acid treatments should not hurt and are usually effective, however if the warts are irritated or too large there is the wartrol. it is a homeophatic relief that boosts your immune system to fight a certain condition. It is great.

It is quite possible that he could be going through heavy amounts of stress at work, or maybe he is going through some family issues. It is also possible that he has found another girl. In my opinion you should just move on and try to forget about him, if he decides to call you back and apologize, then you should try to patch things up. But if he still resists calling you have to move on to better things in life, like try walking in the park, hang out with your friends, or watch a movie...Do anything to keep your mind off him... And when you are ready, find another guy that is right for you.
ZU3AsauFaa	I would suggest that the most powerful motivator is the truth. What is your truth? And why are you hiding from it? This may be hard but spend a minute really thinking about this question....are you truthful with yourself? Do you take an assessment of your life and really know what's going on without sugar coating it or emphasizing the negative? Have you taken a picture of yourself and acknowledged, fully acknowledged that you don't look good - that you don't look healthy? Have you looked down at your midsection, when you're sitting down? How much of that bulge is bulging over? Forget about your looks for a second and spend a minute acknowledging the health consequences to your extra slice of pizza. Are you avoiding old friends or maybe your brother because you don't want to see the looks on their face in reaction to your weight gain? Do your helpful friends even make a comment here and there that would get you on track, but you ignore them? Do you say to yourself, "they're just jealous. They might be thin, but they're hungry and miserable. At least I'm full and happy". Maybe none of these questions resonate with you. But if you focus on the truth, you'll find the right question inside of yourself, the one that reflects the truth and the key to your motivation. <br>  |`|e949be4e14309a829861acb4c7284767aa	There is one way and only one: you make a commitment to yourself, one that you will follow through with, no matter what. Say you decide to work out 4 days a week. You decide what days, put them on the calendar, and you do it, no matter how whiney or tired or busy or whatever you feel. Even if it's dark out, or your car broke down, or whatever.  This way, you are making it a priority, you are telling yourself it's the most important thing for you everyday, and you are following through with it. This will help you so much, because you are also learning to trust yourself, and trust your own commitments.  This is how self-esteem is created.<br>  <br>  After you've done this for a few weeks, its way easier, as the momentum you've created and the endorphins floating in your brain will be further inducements to continue your program.<br>  <br>  Great question!!!

The terms "midget" and "dwarf" are often used synonymously, as both terms mean someone who has been short in stature since birth, but those terms were not originally synonyms.<br>  Midget is a term that was originally coined in 1865, referring to an extremely short but normally proportioned person.[1] P.T. Barnum indirectly helped popularize "midget" when he began featuring General Tom Thumb in his circus. Dwarf was originally used to denote those with short limbs as compared to those who had proportioned limbs. Like many other older terms, "midget" has become part of popular language, although it was often used in a pejorative sense. When applied to a person who is very short, midget is now often considered offensive, an example of the euphemism treadmill.[2] Actor Hervé Villechaize insisted on being called a "midget" as opposed to a "little person", which irritated dwarf activists of the time.<br>  Unusual shortness of stature is caused by an inherited gene and can be diagnosed at birth by several telltale signs or later when the child is a toddler. The word dwarf has generally replaced midget though the term little person is preferred. According to the Little People of America, dwarfism is "a medical or genetic condition that usually results in an adult height of 4 [feet] 10 [inches] [(147 cm)] or shorter, among both men and women, although in some cases a person with a dwarfing condition may be slightly taller than that."[3]<br>  Modern terminology now distinguishes between the two types of dwarfism using the terms proportionate dwarfism, such as primordial dwarfism, and disproportionate dwarfism, such as achondroplasia. Proportionate dwarfism is often the result of a hormonal deficiency (such as growth hormone deficiency), and it may be treated medically.<br>  Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, 1961) defines "midget" in the noun form as "a very diminutive person", and in the adjective form as "like a midget in size; very diminutive", hence its usage as a synonym for "miniature", as with cars.<br>  According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term "midget" comes from "midge", meaning a sand fly, and the suffix "-et", meaning little or small|`|Xg8Y3kTZaa	I'm 13 and I'm 5', 90 pounds.

eFW5O92Yaa	When I first started working out, and still had fat, I didn't worry about the muscle showing, just the fact that the muscle mass was there. However, to lose about 5lb and still have a diet that gives enough energy to build muscle, what I do, is very simple. Eat healthy. Eat normal. Don't cut back on your eating really. Just eat your 3 meals like normal and not too many snacks, but make sure they aren't all junk food. Eat a bunch of vegetables and things that fill you up fast but don't give much fat, like rice. Really though, guy to guy, don't worry about the 6 pack.
uZxAWgaoaa	It's all down to nutrition.  Calories are calories.  You can go on a 1500 calorie a day diet you can get those 1500 calories with straight sugar.  Yes, you will lose weight - and eventually vital signs.
lD3N7C8paa	that's not true....one might black out due to lack of oxygen but the impact would kill him/her. this is confirmed by sum bunjee jumping incidents where the person blacked out but it would be only true for a person whose bodily system is not up to scratch because one sum1 is jumping adrenaline would rush through your body..<br>  |`|L3BJtLR2aa	pretty sure there is no possible way to actually know. i would agree with the whoever above me that said black out but not die. <br>  <br>  also i was thinkin..what if someone was trying to commit suicide by jumping off a really big building, but somehow they didn't die and they were just paralyzed from the neck down for the rest of their life!!! what i large bummer!! they wouldn't even be able to try again(which is good). i'm guessing they would wish they had never tried.|`|ONg5uROKaa	I'm pretty sure that's just a myth... although I do remember hearing about someone who fell of an 80 story building and his heart stopped beating when he was only past the 50th floor.  I think it's only in the case of very weak hearted people.|`|DxIxYY3Iaa	I knew someone that jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge. He was knocked out but otherwise uninjured. That tosses the theory of dying of fright or heart attack.|`|4WdOqR1Kaa	That's false. You might pass out from freight on the way down but what actually kills you is the impact with the ground. |`|VkLna1Ojaa	no its not true...you may black out but you don't die till you hit the ground|`|Fs8sc9rbaa	Try Bungee jump closest thing to the real thing.. <br>  |`|97b5127ddddc7a556167788c3c948831aa	i'm not sure but that would be like a double whammie lol|`|35mEHR68aa	Sounds awful, but i agree with one of the answers....that u would probably black out from fright.|`|AA11401784	Generally, you would be conscious and alert until impact.<br>  <br>  - Stuart|`|DjHWw3h3aa	i don't think you would die but u would pass out from lack of Oxygen on the way down|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	I don't think you would die from fright. Think of all the traumatic people that people experience with fear (torture, rape, etc.) and don't die during that.<br>  It's the impact that would kill. But some people fall from incredible heights and they are only paralyzed. Think how awful that would be for someone who wanted to be dead--to be permanently paralyzed and unable to even try to kill themselves again.|`|AA12314319	Only some people.  No one should ever consider suicide because all your doing, is hurting your family and friends. They have to live with it for the rest of their lives. Only selfish people commit suicide|`|ILIY7Ocaaa	absolutely not. impact kills. in order to have a heart attack your heart must stop from some failure. not being scared.|`|qT0T4ASXaa	I am not sure. No one probably lived to tell the tale.
Rk46lIBwaa	No of course you can't and no sane surgeon would consider this procedure, NHS or privately!<br>  <br>  Hysterectomy is a major operation with a significant morbidity and a small mortality rate.<br>  <br>  Most gynaecologists will not even consider female laparoscopic sterilisation in a nulliparous woman at age 25 years.<br>  <br>  Why not have a Mirena coil inserted once every 5 years, 2 of these in succession would take you to 35 years when a laparoscopic sterilisation could be carried out, even then of course a hysterectomy would not be an option for sterilisation purposes alone.<br>  <br>  Your current suggestion is I am afraid akin to saying I want my legs amputated, after all it is my body.|`|d89qNyb6aa	Things change hun and YOU might change.You might want kids later on in your life and you won't be able to have them.<br>  I don't think you will get one on the NHS unless you need one for medical reasons.A Hysterectomy is a BIG operation and it takes a while to recover after it.You will also go straight into the menopause after the op.The symptoms of menopause are....<br>  <br>  Hot flushes <br>  Night sweats <br>  Palpitations <br>  Insomnia <br>  Joint aches <br>  Headaches<br>  Thinning hair<br>  Passing urine more often day and night<br>  Vaginal dryness<br>  Leakage of urine<br>  Dry ageing skin<br>  Foggy / forgetful thinking<br>  Emotional for no reason|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	My friend, now in her 40s, didn't want any kids and asked for a hysterectomy years ago.  Doctors don't like to destroy healthy tissue unless there is a good reason.  Anyway, she suffered bad periods all her life and still does but the medics said that she may change her mind and regret it so they wouldn't do it (quite rightly).  She opted for sterilisation but wished they had done the hysterectomy years ago and saved herself years of monthly suffering.|`|ZKw46efXaa	no i dont think they would! maybe try sterilisation instead! <br>  <br>  you may change your mind one day so you have to be really sure that you never want kids!!! <br>  <br>  you will have a very lonley life when you are older!!|`|C3sqTngtaa	i dont think you would get a hysterectomy, however why dont you consider sterilisation?|`|wv1H0Rpeaa	I don't think they would do it that young, not unless there was a medical reason. Especially on the NHS. Why don't you try the Implant? It lasts a few years and its a little injection rather than a serious Operation, you wouldn't be able to work for a few months. At least then, you could have the option of having kids if you change your mind and you don't have to think about it for a few years at least then?|`|651e1ee6ad591c873f721e0ec3f034b2aa	Hysteretcomy, as said, has side effects of menopause, I am sure you are not in a hurry for that.<br>  At 25 I was sure I wouldn't want kids either, babies looked pretty revolting to me and older kids looked like a pain in the butt.  Nature is pretty strong though and at 26 I got a bit broody and between 27-30 had my three kids.  <br>  If money is the problem, how can you know at 25 that you won't have money at any stage?<br>  <br>  Now I certainly wouldn't like to imagine myself childless at fifty and I think it would be wiser to have an IUD and change it every 5 years and keep your options open.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	No, its a major surgery costing anywhere from about 20,000 dollars.  YOu can get your tubes tied for around 6 gran.  Some insurance cos will pay some wont.  Insurance will only pay for the hyster.  if it is needed.  <br>  You are right, it is your choice and a very responsible one I might add.  There are birth control methods now that are very easy and last long term.   <br>  Good luck with what you decide to do.  One word of advice, the success of any kind of surgery depends on your health and very much on the skill of the surgeon you select.  So be a detective and seek a surgeon very carefully.|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	due to your age and good health, i doubt your doctor would put you forward for one. this is coz he may consider you changing your mind to have kids in say 10 15 years.<br>  <br>   doctor would be more likely to offer contraception, but you have nothing to lose by going and talking to doctor|`|FUyyTMF5aa	Idk cause they normally do it only if you NEED it.<br>  your a healthy woman,just go and consult you GP about the idea :)<br>  and your brave, id never be able o go through with one!|`|8128c43a296489cc2aa055016ef18a56aa	no without any medical problems  you can,t at the age 27 you can get you tubes tried but you have no kids so they may make you wait|`|PISqstlRaa	the wont do it on the nhs for no problem  thehy might do it privately but it might cost quite a bit <br>  <br>  good luck|`|lnUrm4sGaa	no i really don't think they would offer you a hysterectomy but you may be able to get sterilised have your tubes tied,<br>  speak to your gp but they may not be convinced as you are young and they may think their is a chance you may want children later in life despite you saying you don't ,
6NZeItMAaa	Find a balanced diet that makes sense to you and plan your meals in advance.<br>  <br>  For the rest of the day, between meals, try to eat some negative calories foods like carrotts, celery, apples, etc.<br>  <br>  You could also try spirulin algae that helps to fight food anxiety and have some herbal remedies like chamomilla tea that will help you to relax.<br>  <br>  Don't get obssessed by food, think of it like a nutrient that your body needs to its function and not like a pleasure.<br>  <br>  When obssessed, relax, close you eyes, take deep breaths and think: I don't need more food, I've already had my part for my health, I don't need more food, I can go on without that snack, I only need to eat right, I can do it, etc;, it takes some minutes to the brain to forget that craving and then it will be over.<br>  <br>  You can also go out for a walk, exercise, danse with your favorite music, etc there are a lot of things that you can do to forget your cravings, just find your will.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	You need to start exercising....especially when you get "food cravings".  You also need to start eating the right types of food.  Google up a starter exercise program/diet that you can do at home (buy yourself some small weights around the 3 lbs mark), and start exercising and toning your body.  You'll be thrilled with the results !!!|`|CDH5WVDbaa	I think we sound identical! Im the same, wanna lose a few kgs but i honestly have food on the brain ALL the time! I just needed a reason to be on the diet im on now. You just need to be motivated. For me, models and high end fashion designers are my inspiration because they are what I'm interested in. Anyway when i feel like giving in to my icecream or peanut butter addiction i just look at magazines, or somethign to remind me of what i am capable of and dont REALLY feel hungry.|`|D8m1eqlVaa	I know exactly how you feel. Try to do a one week orange juice cleanse. This will get all of the toxins out of your body, and you won't have the cravings anymore. It was the hardest thing I've ever done but I'm glad I did it. I still think about junk food, but I don't want to eat it. <br>  <br>  Drink nothing but orange juice, organic if possible, for seven days. If you can't handle it, you can have some organic apples and nuts (I had to do this and it still worked). You will be HUNGRY at first, but keep eating apples and sleep alot. It helps.<br>  <br>  After seven days, eat some vegetable broth and fruit. DO NOT immediately start eating meals again, or it will hurt your tummy and make things hard to digest. Slowly go back to regular food, beginning with broth and gradually adding fruits and veggies, then rice, wheat bread, oatmeal, low fat cheese and milk. Don't start eating junk food again. I broke down once and tried to eat a cookie, it was the most disgusting thing I ever tried, and they were my favorite brand before.<br>  <br>  You can do it and you'll be glad you did! Good luck!
Gojbv3Nraa	Uphill biking. 45-90 minutes a day, 3-4 days a week. Must do some other exercise on the days in between. It worked awesomely for me as a teen. Arms were awesome too.|`|OBW7N4KKaa	seated calf raise<br>  google that|`|CX9JBYTCaa	When I was using my Yoga Booty Ballet DVDs, the first thing I noticed was calf muscle. I guess it's the ballet part that really uses and strengthens your calves, so maybe you could look into the DVDs (which are actually quite good and aren't too expensive on Amazon) or ballet itself.
DoPuQC0Laa	i would check a local gym.<br>  They have trained professionals that<br>  will motivate you and help you achieve your goals.<br>  I would look online for ratings of gyms and their personnel.|`|gbUKzTyVaa	N*gs, just go to your local gym!  Find the smartest, ripped-est looking guy and ask him to help you out, and push you to your max.<br>  <br>  More important than how "good" the personal trainer is, is telling him to push you beyond your limits!!!<br>  <br>  Like, a personal trainer who's "cool, funny, nice, and knowledgeable" isnt gonna help you do jacksh*t if you get to talking to him... ANY personal trainer will do, as long as they can be mean and serious/tough, know what they're doing, and can push you to new limits!<br>  <br>  And by looking, you can scope out which one will be able to do that. :P
DErZDyBQaa	To see your abs it's mostly about low body fat %, lose a few pounds and you will see a more defined outline as you drop pounds. Doing ab exercises only enlarges the abs.<br>  <br>  Diet is key!|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - <a href="http://www.straightabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightabs.com</a>|`|6a03ff317c0404130f2f7b0a8ad3200baa	try doing the jackknife exercise for your abs and taking a protein supplement preferably muscle milk.

VbjjX5K9aa	First of all, green tea. It speeds up your metabolism, so you can burn calories more efficiently. Keep eating healthy, and somewhat limited. Dont starve yourself. Secondly, you can get something called colon cleansing pills, which i believe you can buy at a drugstore. But the average person holds about 15 pounds of extra fat and junk in their intestines, and these pills will get rid of that. Neither the green tea or the pills are expensive, and this should help alot, and i would expect you will lose that 10 pounds easily. Good luck|`|7fIAqGpuaa	its not healthy to lose that much weight that fast|`|IgvrguCVaa	eat one a dayy and work out lik cryiiin....

Plan B tends to mess with your cycle and make you spot and have periods at random times for a cycle or two afterwards, so I'm pretty sure that spotting was just from the leftover effects of the plan B.<br>  <br>  If you were pregnant right now, the home tests would DEFINITELY pick up on it, because you'd be theoretically more than a month and a half along by now.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and get some more reliable BC like the pill, or the copper IUD which doesn't use hormones so it messes with your hormones less. :)<br>  <br>  You have like, a .0001 chance of being pregnant, so no, you're not pregnant. Just take a deep breath, go take a warm bath and chill out. I almost made myself sick one time fretting over this. You'll be okay. :3<br>  Good luck!

xRQAsGRAaa	Your abs are definitely there, but there's fat on top of them. Do 30 minutes of cardio 4-5 days a week, and your abs will slowly start to pop out. If you really dedicate yourself, Your abs will be there by beach season(summer). Just as long as you keep a healthy diet with your cardio.<br>  Just so you know, ab workouts do strengthen your abs, but they won't make them any more visible. You need cardio to do that.|`|mRTFUUayaa	ehh, thats just your stomach with just a little muscle :]<br>  <br>  if you want abs, at least 500 situps every day and do plank transitions. start with your hands shoulderwidth apart on the ground (in a pushup position) and stay like that for 40-60 seconds, then goes down on your forearms and hold for 60sec-1min, then go back up to hands and hold for 40-60 seconds. i usually do some situps in between sets. do about 3-4 sets <br>  <br>  good luck :]|`|FhoKLOqHaa	looks chubby, lose weight first, then do the workouts|`|H6uYThgjaa	well, you still have some work ahead of you. there aren't any lines visible yet that suggest a six-pack. but seems like you are on the right track. make sure you vary the exercises and push yourself more. definition in abs take a bit, but you can do it!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|3sPVbL2Naa	not bad and not chubby<br>  not abs either though, not enough definition to see them<br>  you need at least 10% body fat to start to see them clearly<br>  your at a good weight and it looks like i did not to long ago, if you get your body fat percentage down a little then you can show em off with confidence <br>  it depends on how long on many factors like how much dedication you have on diet and exercise

bb8740cbd7c94be820535e8abb6199fcaa	You should follow the directions on the kit to get the best results.  Most kits say you can bleach once or twice a day for either 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your sensitivity level.  If you do develop sensitivity, reduce the amount of time you bleach and possibly skip a day to let your teeth to settle down before proceeding again.  You can also take an Ibuprofen such as Advil or Motrin if you experience any discomfort during your bleaching.  I always say it's best to go slow with bleaching your teeth and not over do it trying to attain the Hollywood smile all at once.  This way you will reach your desired results with a more comfortable bleaching experience and with less discomfort. <br>  <br>  Most patients will whiten when they feel their teeth have started to darken again, usually this is just a touch up bleaching (usually one or two times for an hour) done once or twice a year.  It will really depend on your diet and habits that darken the teeth.  For longer lasting results avoid smoking, drinking dark wines and be sure to floss and brush after eating or drinking anything that is staining.|`|C7RW3gk1aa	When I was in school, it was recommended never to whiten more than twice a year.  If you maintain a diet that limits food that stains the whitening can last up to two years, but if you drink coffee, wine, colas your teeth darken again.  <br>  <br>  |`|ZqWqWhM2aa	i was a dental assistant for quite some time i only worked with britesmile a proffessional whitening procedure, our patients would get aftercare packs with top up whitening trays to use about 3-6 months after the proceedure but this also depends on your diet lots of red wine and coloured foods + smoking stain the teeth so if there looking a bit darker again just do it at your own leisure! And try to stick to white foods whilst on the whitening kit youll get a better result :)
mdudtx7zaa	Diet pills can work, but so do diets. The best thing is really to change your eating habits. Getting into a routine of eating the right foods works best for most people. If it took you years to put on the weight, then taking it off in a few days is probably not going to work (at least for the long term). My suggestion is to start slow and get into a routine. Realize that you'll have ups and downs. That's normal. My other suggestion is to write your weight down, if not daily at least weekly. You can then monitor how your progress is. Something strange happens (for the good) when you actually monitor what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Rob

nxzPUrHKaa	Ok, there are many mis-conceptions to do with Creatine.<br>  <br>  you seem smart enough to know that Creatine mainly affects your ATP (AdenasineTriPhosphate) systems. Otherwise known as Energy systems.<br>  <br>  Creatine = Energy<br>  It helps aid in muscle recovery as well as energy top up during training.<br>  <br>  Now seeing that you seem to be taking so much of during training, it will have minimal effect in regards to your healing process.<br>  <br>  The best advice to give for a Charlie, is Rest!<br>  <br>  I received a big blow to my leg a few years back, playing rugby. It was so bad it was a Hematoma (Internal bleeding). I did what you did. Was taking Creatine, over-trained and as a result made it worse.<br>  <br>  Looking back on it, I shouldve listened to the Doc......REST!!!<br>  <br>  You may miss a game or two (Or a week or two of training to be safe), but its worth it in the long run.<br>  <br>  I came back the next week, made it worse n it resulted in me missing 5weeks or Rugby!!! All because I didnt listen to the Docs advice.<br>  Not Cool at all!<br>  <br>  Stretching will also help. Just to keep the muscles flexible during this time of re-coperation<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|C0sT0PPyaa	creatine will help your recovery.  although its primary functions do not do that.  yes the answer about atp is a correct stat, but its completely pointless to bring up and hes just showing off, because there's a difference between the product and the energy source in the body.  the creatine supplement will fill your muscles with more water and in turn you will have more raw strength (and of course endurance because you muscles are stronger).  Do you see how this will help you heal, and be less injurious.<br>  <br>  you experience is due to scar tissue that built up. scar tissue doesn't respond to change as well and is not as flexible.  stretch out every angle of your leg and body that is tighter and stiffer than the good side.  do this for at least a few months  yoga will help you stretch places you didn't realize are tight.  this will help loosen the scar tissue.  it takes longer to counter act the affects of scar tissue so give it 6 more months and don't hurt it again.<br>  <br>  ice any pain so more scar tissue doesn't for and anti inflammatorys are commonly recommends for the same reason but i don't like meds.|`|xRQAsGRAaa	No. Creatine can actually cause cramps, because it dehydrates you.<br>  It would not help you heal. It's a great supplement for gaining lean muscle, but don't use it for recovery.<br>  Whey protein could help your muscle heal, but don't work it out again until it's back to 100% or you could risk tearing it even worse. Just ice it, take advil for the pain(if it's that bad), and eat a lot of protein, or buy some Whey protein.
zNGWFKXGaa	Try to eat 5 very small (!) nutrious meals (fruit, veggies, meat, fish etc...) per day. Cut out all junk food (like sodas, corn sirup, mayo & sauces......).

I have a problem called <br>  Blepharitis which is similar is respect of the itchy feeling and at times stickiness. I am not saying your problem is the same, but I clean the lids with a cotton bud using 1 drop of baby shampoo diluted in half cup of cooled boiled water. Never use the same bud for more than one stroke on the lid. Being double ended I use 1 stick for each eye.<br>   Perhaps you could ask Mum if this would be of help.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	The easiest thing to do is induce your period so it is early however it is not guaranteed to work, but it is more reliable than trying to delay your period - as long as you have at least two weeks of uterus lining built up it is possible to induce and it is not unhealthy if only done every now and then. <br>  <br>  The best option is to see your doctor, one thing they can prescribe is a drug called Provera which works by first giving your body progesterone to build up the uterus lining, and then when you stop taking the pill the drop in progesterone will bring on menstruation, this could in theory be used to delay your period too. <a href="http://www.healthsquare.com/newrx/pro1361.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthsquare.com/newrx/pro136...</a> There is what is known as 'menstrual management' which is where hormonal birth control is used to stop periods, it's a matter of huge debate as long-term health problems of doing this are not yet known, but in theory it should be easy to do in the short-term. Talk to your doctor about it, as long as you aren't shown to have any issues towards menstruation and it's a one off thing they are more than likely willing to help you out if they can. <br>  <br>  You can use natural methods similar to those used to induce miscarriage or as emergency contraception, as long as you don't use them all the time they are perfectly safe to use to induce menstruation. Progesterone blocking, uterine contracting and oestrogenic herbs are used to induce miscarriage and induce menstruation, but unless you know what you are doing they can be risky, so for you I'd recommend sticking to the commonly used and safer options;<br>  <br>  Parsley, this is a mild emmenagogue which means it relaxes the cervix to make menstruation possible. You can use the herb in your vagina, but I'm guessing you'd prefer taking it in tea form. Use fresh herb when possible, fill a small to medium sized pan with water and bring to the boil, then remove from the heat and add a handful or two of chopped parsley, cover and let steep for 20-30 minutes – never boil as the herb will loose it's potency. Strain the tea and sweeten, drink a few times a day until your period. Don't use if you have kidney problems. <br>  <br>  There are many other herbs that can be used, however some such as Pennyroyal if used incorrectly is very harmful and even fatal, or Dong quai which is relatively safe but can cause increased flow, where as parsley is harmless and commonly used very successfully. For more information see <a href="http://www.sisterzeus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sisterzeus.com</a><br>  <br>  Vitamin C, this starves the uterus of progesterone which aids in breaking down the walls of your uterus to bring on menstruation. Choose a product with fewer additional ingredients as it is suspected that bioflavinoids are added to vitamin C products to protect against miscarriage. The dosage you would need to take to induce menstruation is 6-12 grams per day, divide your total grams for the day into equal doses spaced equally throughout the day and take with plenty of water. Don't use if you have kidney problems, if you take aspirin, or have sickle cell anemia. <br>  <br>  They do not sound like much but these have been used for a hell of a long time to induce menstruation, as emergency contraception and in home abortions and are still used today if only by a few. These are more than strong enough to induce menstruation if used correctly and sensibly. <br>  <br>  There are also some things you can do to help things along; <br>  <br>  Sex or masturbation, during orgasm a hormone which causes uterine contractions is released called Oxytocin (also released during labor), the contractions your vagina goes through along with the relaxation afterwards can start the shedding process off, along with the blood flowing more to your vaginal regions during arousal, semen too can help to soften the cervix in order to allow menstrual material out from the vagina. Hot baths are useful as this help to open blood vessels and promotes circulation, massaging the lower abdomen can also be useful. <br>  <br>  When it comes down to it though there is nothing you cannot do during your period, and some things are even better. If you want to have sex or fool around then go in the bath/shower, put a towel down, use period belts, soft tampons, softcups, diaphragms as menstrual cups, or just deal with the mess as sex is supposed to be a messy anyway. You can always avoid intercourse, other forms of sex such as anal sex, femoral sex or just touching can all be more sensual, and it takes pressure of your partner to perform. If you worry about leaking then use a menstrual cup or softcup that can be worn for 12 hours, including while swimming or sleeping, without leaking or health risk. If you suffer cramps then act now to prevent them, get treatment from a doctor or use cell salts or clary sage to get rid of the pain. There are many ways to make menstruation easier to prevent it getting in the way of your life.|`|Hue313M3aa	Continue taking your birth control pills, skip the placebo and you will likely not start until next months placebo pills. That is your best bet. |`|3fk6bTMxaa	Cycle Pain:<br>  The night before your cycle starts or at the very beginning of your cycle, have an ibuprofen (Advil) and this will help immediately with cramping and will most likely reduce your flow by half throughout your cycle.

Check out Cycle Savvy for more fascinating cycle knowledge. Justisse also has an online guide for understanding our cycles and our bodies.

That will slow dramatically or even stop it.<br>  <br>  Usually when you are on pills you know exactly when your menses will come and they should be lighter anyway unless that particular brand doesn't work with your hormones.<br>  <br>  There are some medications that you can ask for.

Women have been wishing for centuries that they could put off their period forever!  Unfortunately unless you are pregnant, or been through menopause or previously been prescribed birth control that gives you your period quarterly, the odds are that you cannot put it off.  It is not something that can be turned on and off like a faucet.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Yes, that is a symptom. It is called isolating.  You have to just do your best to suck it up and go out for a good time. Usually you end up doing OK in spite of the depression, unless the depression is extremely severe.<br>  <br>  Here are my depression tips learned over years and years of dealing with bipolar disorder and anxiety:<br>  <br>  If your depression seems to be more of a problem in the winter, try to get more sun. You could have seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, or your depression could have a seasonal component, meaning you can get depressed other times of the year, but you tend to have more trouble in the winter. A light box is really good if you can afford one (about $300 online, don't get it at a local store, they will charge more for a light less than 1/2 as bright).  Since I will always have a mood disorder, I have put in extra windows, keep the drapes mounted so they don't cover them, make sure I spend a lot of time in southern exposure rooms, painted the walls peach and yellow, mostly.  I even have a skylight, although that was here when I moved in (and I LOVE it, it helps a lot!!!!!)<br>  <br>  Try turning the heat up in the house or dressing much more warmly. It is hard to feel anxiety when you are too warm. I was able to cut out ativan use altogether by using this trick. Saved me big $$ too, because pills cost way more than heat. Hot baths work too, and in a pinch, like at work/school, you can try running hot water over your hands. <br>  <br>  Avoid caffeine like the plague. Also, some cold remedies can cause anxiety. Look for the "agitation in children" warning on the box. Adults can get problems too.<br>  <br>  Try meditation tapes like progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery. They may seem silly at first, but they work!!  They help reduce stress, which makes depression worse.<br>  <br>  Go out with friends, and if you don't have any, find a club to join and MAKE yourself go until you actually look forward to it. Isolation makes depression worse.  <br>  <br>  Exercise at least 1/2 hour a day, and anytime you feel really hyper or depressed. Exercise is a great mood stabilizer and cuts down on anxiety a lot.<br>  <br>  If your depression makes it hard for you to sleep, here are some  good "sleep hygeine" tips so you can sleep better. Like go to bed and get up about the same time each day, even weekends. Don't use your bedroom to watch TV and read and use the computer and all that-just use the room as a bedroom normally would be used. Don't do stuff that pumps you up right before bed, like exercising and using the computer. You want to use that last hour to wind down-Take a bath ? Make the bedroom really dark, cover up the clock radio, even so the light doesn't shine at you. If you live in the rackety city, use a noise generator (makes wave sounds and the like) to cover up the city sounds. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening.<br>  <br>  Put a lot of colorful things around the house, happy type things, and keep the blinds open and let the sun in. Get yourself some flowers. Put on some pretty clothes. Make a list of things that make you happy. Here's some things on my list: A basket full of fluffy kittens, bread fresh from the oven, Fireworks popping on a warm summer evening, The first fireflies of the season, the scent of Jergen's cherry almond lotion, The crisp sound of a saltine cracker breaking, fresh sheets on the bed, etc. Use all your senses and read that list when you are breaking down<br>  Work on time management if being overwhelmed and late for things and too much to do is getting to you. Cut back on other responsibilities temporarily so you can spend more restorative time with friends and family.  <br>  <br>  You got a significant other? Extra physical touch is very helpful. Most people in the US or UK are touch deprived, so hold hands more, hug more, give shoulder rubs, etc. A pet is good to cuddle with, too, if your home situation allows you to get one & take good care of it. (I'm an animal lover, don't get one if you can't commit to it for 15 years)<br>  <br>  DON'T listen to sad music! Sooooooo easy to do when depressed, but sooooooo bad for your depression! Listen to happy stuff.  Watch happy movies too, btw.<br>  <br>  <br>  I give these suggestions to lots of folks, and hardly anyone ever tries them.. I have really really severe psychiatric symptoms from bipolar disorder and post traumatic stress disorder, I mean, I have one of the most severe cases you can get. And I am able to control my behavior almost 100% even when I am suffering, and able to feel quite a bit better using some of these tricks, because the meds have only been minimally effective for me. If I didn't do stuff like the above, I would be in an institution or group home for sure. So please try some of these things, there is no harm in them, and they may provide some real relief for you. Pills alone or counseling alone are not as effective as pills PLUS counseling, and you have to follow some of those suggestions the counselors give you.  Suggestions like the ones above.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|QGDtBkZzaa	yea its a sign of depression!<br>  <br>  i think you should go hang out with friends and go see your bf!<br>  <br>  it could help out!!<br>  <br>  if it getd really severe then i think you should go see a doctor or something.
YLHgxUsraa	unless a doctor has told you the child has a weak immune system your husband is wrong. kids get sick, usually from playing with other kids and sharing toys and such. just make sure the child eats a healthy well balanced diet and unless he has a medical condition that would preclude it give him a children's multivitamin once a day. make him wash his hands frequently and practice good general hygiene. and if you are given antibiotics by the doctor make sure to give the entire course as prescribed or else the infection might not be completey gone.|`|AHexXClbaa	Has his doctor discussed removing his tonsils?  I was a very sick child because of my tonsils.  When they were removed my health improved 100%.  I even developed an appetite and was able to maintain a normal weight.
SroGRBUDaa	If he has waited patiently for three years he must also love you too.  This is your first sign he may be in it for YOU and not sex.  It will just happen when the time is right but please BE prepared, have a condom ready and USE it.  Find out if he has been with anyone recently, yes you have been with him three years but make sure he has been with YOU for three years as well.  and I agree with Suzuki, is he the one you want to remember as your first?  I know my first wasnt, I made a huge mistake and wish I would have done it differently.  So I messed up and just started over :)  Be safe, and use a condom for sure.<br>  <br>  I am changing my answer just because of reading your past questions?  Is he the guy that came back from the war a year ago?  You like another guy (posted a month ago) and wonder if you should be with him?  I think you sound a little confused and shouldnt give in just yet until you know for sure. When you say you have been together for three years but also say "I like this guy" in another question, it makes me wonder if the guy you are considering feels the same about being with you for three years.  So check it all out, make sure he is the one...if not, hold on to your virginity.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	You know when you are ready because you feel emotionally connected to the other person. It seems as if you are in a committed relationship so things should flow naturally, just make sure you have proper protection.  A condom and spermicide are best for your first encounter, plus some lube to open things up.  Just set up a romantic dinner in and once you are both relaxed just bring it up gently.  I wish you luck!|`|kgfFGl0paa	You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following, and of you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex *should* be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first will also help your vagina to be stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  If you're OK with *everything* I've said above... it should be a simple thing for you to take advantage of a passionate moment of kissing or some other seriously romantic time, tell him something like "I want you so much..." and see if he responds with something that might lead to the two of you having sex.   <br>  <br>  Don't forget: *he* might not feel ready, so if you know he loves you, don't be offended in the unlikely event that he backs out.   There's a lot more to sex than just "doing it", and he *might* know it's not his time yet and insist on waiting.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13.   No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|Gxog88I3aa	You didn't mention how old you are.  But first thing is if you are both mature enough to have sex then you need to be able to talk about it, when you are not fooling around.  <br>  <br>  Just sit down and talk about it.  That way you can also discuss birth control and make sure you are both ready for what you are getting into.<br>  <br>  Also remember for girls it is an emotional thing and for most guys it is just physical.  <br>  <br>  Meaning just because you have sex does not change the relationship for him as much emotionally as it does for you.  <br>  <br>  Also think how will you feel if you were to break up would you want him to be the one you will always remember as your first?  If he is a great guy then he would be perfect for your first.<br>  <br>  Just some things to think about..<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  |`|Ua3l7OXpaa	When you're prepared, and know all the possible consequenses of having sex.

Find out how many cath procedures they perform annually, success rate, how many are interventional vs. medical treatment. <br>  <br>  Do you know of any problems or issues that were specific to this cath lab. Use this info to come up w/your 3 topics or elements. Incorporate this into your presentation along w/the national statistics. <br>  <br>  Evidence based practice is where nursing is headed. If you use the statement "studies have shown..."  this gives you credibility. <br>  <br>  A hot topic is "door to cath lab time" for your acute MI. Most hospitals have protocols for this.<br>  <br>  Also, always know your role in an emergency. ACLS protocols, etc.

AA10299265	It's sorta true. If you exercise (even a little), green tea can help you burn fat. If you eat too many Calories w/o burning them off, not even God Himself can help you lose weight.<br>  <br>  Losing weight is really pretty easy if you simply eat the foods our bodies were designed to eat. Wholesome, natural foods. The more raw fruits and vegetables, and the fewer refined carbs, the more likely you are to have success. Combine an hour, or so of moderate daily exercise and the weight will plummet. This diet will also help you become more regular.

This is decision that is very personal, but when made, requires the support of the people around her. It's a tough decision, but with the cost of cigarettes seeming to go up just as fast as the stock market falls, now is a better time than any to stop.<br>  <br>  That is something you can use to convince her to stop. The money factor is huge. For a girl, image how many extra pairs of shoes you could buy with your smoke money? If you smoke a pack a day, that's about $7 per day, times 30. $210/month times 12 = 2520.

XfbMcu6Caa	being sore does NOT necessarily mean you had a good workout, all it means is that your muscles are not used to the exercise. you can still have huge gains from not being sore after workouts once you get used to it. just remember to keep pushing yourself harder (higher weights etc) every time otherwise your gains will stop.|`|yLoaUH12aa	As long as you are making progress with what you can lift, then don't worry as much about being sore. Work your muscle groups to exhaustion occasionally, but not every time. In general, I prefer lifting heavier rather than more reps.|`|NCWLWEkDaa	Yes, if you're sore that means you're muscles have been worked to their full potential and are telling you to give them time to recover before you lift again.|`|O8abrV6Vaa	Being sore is good- it means you've worked your muscles hard. After lifting for long periods of time, you wont get as sore as you do when you first start, but switching up your routine will help get some of it back- whats worked best for me is using different styles of lifting, most perticularly drop sets. Hope your lifting goes well.

A+ on that. Second, you need to ask yourself or the teacher if he/she wants you to lose weight because you "need" to look like the other girls? Does your teacher try to convince you that you aren't a healthy weight for a dancer? (BTW: Dancers usually are thin, but that's because they work hard and exercise a lot - NOT BECAUSE THEY STARVE THEMSELVES!) If your teacher wants you to lose weight because you "need" to look like the other girls, or for another similar reason, then you have another question that you need to ask the teacher. How much weight does he/she want you to lose? If it's just a pound or two, then you should do it. But if it's more than that, you shouldn't lose the weight, because it sounds like you don't need to. If that means that you will not be allowed to dance there, then so be it. If you really care about dancing, then you should know that dancers need to be healthy. You cannot dance if you don't eat enough, or if you lose too much weight.weight.|`|4mXqv6IZaa	As long as you are at a healthy weight you shouldn't change anything.  I have had a weight problem and being over weight is very unhealthy.  On the flip side, being under weight can be bad for you too.  Talk to your doctor or find a chart online that will give you guidelines as to what a healthy weight would be for your height and age.  If your weight is in the healthy range, all I would recommend is maybe adding some strength training in addition to your dance.  This will give you a more toned look with the more defined muscle tone.  Good luck.

Don't be pressures into lossing weight.|`|hZfh57jfaa	A good coach should not be pressuring you to lose weight, especially if you know it's healthy. Many dancers yes, are stick thin, but as with many dancers and gymnasts (I know i've been there) you need more food than most to keep up with a very rigorous training, and a lot of the weight is due to muscles, which make you more capable of performing a strong, steady routine. If you lose any wieght it should simply be because as you build muscle (which gains weight) it burns more fat (theres the loss, and the TONE). Toning is different than losing weight. If your teacher gives you issues about this further i'd find a new studio or have your mother "talk" to the teacher. You'd be surprised what parents can do. |`|dWbo0Dvfaa	Maybe ballet dancers are stick thin and it's not healthy because they're teachers ask them to lose weight. If you feel your perfect and you like your weight you shouldn't lose any weight especially if you had problems in the past. It could definitely trigger your old habits and that wouldn't be good x) <br>  I think that if you're weight is really effecting your ability to pursue ballet as a career then forget about it. Do it as a hobbie.<br>   <br>  hope that helps ;)|`|G5IgAPEkaa	Eat a healthy diet recently, exercise, and read the labels of daily food. If you are trying to lose a lot of weight, eat popcorn as a snack. It has no fat in it at all!

On top of this, make sure our daily meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) are healthy also! |`|svHQnABGaa	Tell her that you had an eating disorder and are afraid it will return, if she is willing to risk your health to have you look like the other girls then you need to find a new teacher, if you are a healthy weight you don't need to loose any.

To be good ballerina, you need to practice daily and intensively to get through this time of change.

kby1ksuraa	I'm not sure why your doc said that your genital warts will go away on its own because it won't.  The symptoms may go away, but the actual virus will never go away.  as of now, there in no cure for HPV/genital warts.  I was diagnosed with HPV/genital warts in June of this year.  I had a small cluster of warts around the opening of my vagina and I was prescribed Aldara cream.  I was told to apply it every other night before bed and then to wash it off the next morning.  I did this for about a week and a half and the warts were completely gone.  It's been about 6 months now and I have no sign of them since.  The cream seemed to work well for me, but every person is different.  you may want to look into your different treatment options to see what is best for you.  This is something you will have for the rest of your life, it may seem and sound scary but its okay.  I felt the same way at first, but you can treat genital warts fairly easily and this will not affect your daily life if you don't let it.  This virus will always be in you, but hopefully your symptoms will go away.  Just remember, even if they do...that doesn't mean the virus is gone.  you are still able to pass this virus on to others so be sure to let any new partners now about your condition.|`|h0KhvQlyaa	It never goes away, you will always have HPV no matter what strain it is(Human Papilloma Virus). Its a virus. the ones that are treated go away, it will never pop up in a place that has been treated, but it can pop up in other areas thats why you get 2 or 3 at a time but you will never get them in the exact same place twice. i know someone who has had it for 5 years and hasnt had an outbreak for 3 1/2 years, but she still has the virus, but she no longer has symptoms, just abnormal cells. You can still get the hpv shot and continue to get treated when you break out. its also different for different people you may always have outbreaks once in a while, or they may go away, but if you are sexually active you need to tell your partner because since its a virus like herpes you can still pass it on without symptoms.|`|7rPqP9w7aa	Many who had genital warts and experienced cryotherapy may advice you not to go with it. Aside from it is very painful it only deal with the warts. even if you destroy the current wart some wart might appear again after a month in some cases weeks in other part of your genital area. I suggest You try wartrol first. It is very good and you can have a positive responce sooner than you expected. The advantage of this is obvious, Pain free treatment. it also help you to fight the virus that causing the warts thus increasing your chances of not getting the warts again. It is also cheap compared to others. you can read more info about it here: <a href="http://genitalwarts.weebly.com" rel="nofollow">http://genitalwarts.weebly.com</a>|`|ICxbuoKbaa	The treatment you've just had has only gotten you rid of the genital warts but not from the virus that causes them which is called HPV. So it is possible that you'll suffer a future outbreak.<br>  <br>  You should not be scared though...you just have to be informed about it.<br>  <br>  The problem is that there are currently no treatments for HPV. It will remain in your body until your immune system kicks it out. usually wartrol help with this problem. moreinfo here: <a href="http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=830371" rel="nofollow">http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=830371</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

Don't play games, get another opinion, talk to your M.D. and ask about some drugs...really.  But you have to stay away from the booze. It will only make you feel worse.As someone who put it off for years, I really feel strongly about telling you to just get some other kinds of help and start feeling better again. And to hell with anyone who tells you to "pull yourself up by your bootstraps". They don't know what life is like in your boots. Get some other help. Really. Maybe you need a bit of a boost from the meds to help you see more clearly what other types of changes you have to make...?
kPhfPrweaa	Heres an easier thing i think you could do. Go to the drug store and buy one of those monistat self testing kits. It will tell you if you have an infection. And if you do have a yeast infection you can also buy the medication for that at the drug store.|`|kby1ksuraa	From what you described...it definitely sounds like a yeast infection.  I'm not sure if you have health care or not, but you seeing a doctor would be the best bet.  There are over-the-counter drugs you can take like Monistat but they only do so much.  If your yeast infection is that bad, go to the doctor.  They can give you a prescription such as diflucan or a generic that is a pill, to take and within 24 hours your symptoms go away.  It's like a miracle pill!!! It's definitely your best option.  good luck!|`|4GMTwv85aa	you need to go to your Gynecologist so he can prescribe the right medicine you need.You my need and oral antibiotic and a vaginal cream to help your vaginal problem.

Just buy some monistat 3 or 7 and you'll be fine
kby1ksuraa	Honestly...it can vary.  I was told by my doctor as soon as 2 weeks after being exposed to it, or it can even take years.  It really all depends.  It's also hard to tell who or when you got it.  If you've had multiple sex partners...it could be anyone.  I'm not sure if you are a girl or a guy, but if you're a girl its hard to tell who you got it from.  There is no way to test guys fro HPV which is the virus that causes genital warts.  If you do have genital warts don't panic.  In June of this summer I found out I had it and I got medical care (they gave me a cream) and about a week and a half later it was gone.  I applied the cream every other night before bed and then washed it off in the morning.  It worked very well for me.  I haven't had anything come up since. There are also many other treatment courses to take such as laser removal, freezing them off or even surgery. |`|1jGEeMDYaa	If you have symptoms, they will probably occur 2 to 3 months after infection. But you can have symptoms from 3 weeks to many years after infection. <br>  <br>  Visible genital warts appear only during active infection. But it is possible to spread the virus even if you can't see the warts.<br>  <br>  
xfpJGBfwaa	Try sleep hygeine if you haven't already:<br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/sleep/sleep_hyg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/sleep/sleep_hyg.htm</a><br>  The most important thing in that list is to get out of bed at the same time every morning, no matter what. <br>  <br>  Try Ambien CR which is long-acting to keep you asleep.<br>  <br>  Try a Delta Brainwave Sleep CD which is soothing enough to play all night on repeat.  <br>  <br>  Get a sleep study done to check for Apnea, and ask your partner to wake you if you sound like you're snoring.  When your partner wakes you, check yourself for a feeling of panic or like you've been struggling to breathe, or tight muscles.  All signs of apnea.  Make sure that in the sleep study you sleep for some time on your BACK, which is the position most people have trouble with.  <br>  <br>  Don't exercise after dinner, and if you exercise in the afternoon, eat some carbs with dinner.  Right before bed, have a tiny bit of protein.  This is a diabetic trick to help keep you asleep beyond the time when the liver wakes up and starts burning glycogen to wake you up slowly.  The older you get, the more sensitive you become to the liver's morning routine, even if you're not diabetic.  |`|IcH5gMICaa	I think the simplest thing to try would be to go to bed later.  I often do this if I hit the sack too early, causing me to wake up earlier because my body's already had all the sleep it needs.  For instance, last night I went to bed @ 8:30 (I know I'm old lol) and I woke @ 4:30 -blah.  Tonight if I go to bed around 9:30-10 I won't wake until 6 (or before when my alarm goes off).  <br>  <br>  Also I read recenltly that you shouldn't watch TV or play on your computer the hour before you go to bed, so if you do this, remember the light and the concentration can make you lie awake because it stimulates your nerves.|`|7KHMepStaa	Try exercising at night.<br>  Try some cd's to play of calm music or nature sounds.<br>  |`|8HyCezOqaa	i listen to music.

cNCC3mCbaa	When you're 13, so much is changing: your body, your mind, your beliefs, your workload....and more. All of these make the usual stresses of life even more challenging. <br>  <br>  But what a lot of people overlook, in your age range and older--including many adults, actually--is that you have an inner reservoir of calm and serenity within you. You need to become aware of it and then learn to connect with it and draw strength from it on a regular basis. The most popular way I know of to discover this wellspring within you is to learn Transcendental Meditation. BUT there are many other ways. Including some you can teach yourself without paying to take a course. Absolutely you should see a therapist to be evaluated. We live in a strange time when in many respects life is easier than it's ever been in human history. And yet, as you know, modern living can bring on a range of mental stresses that did not exist 20 years ago, 60 years ago, 100 years ago--take your pick. If your relationship with Mom is not great, there should be someone you can talk with to reveal your sadness or anguish to. A cousin, a girlfriend, a religious figure if you are oriented that way. But still, there are many things you can do to feel better: vigorous exercise 3x or 4x a week, watching zany movies, taking up an artistic hobby such as playing a musical instrument (why do you think a whole music category is called The Blues? It's because singing & playing the blues gets the bad feelings out of your system for a while). <br>  <br>  I know a young teenager who has benefited greatly from talk therapy and medication (prozac). You should research these online. First, do what you can to heal yourself, and then see a professional psychologist. Or do both at the same time. <br>  <br>  Have faith that you can become well again--happy and motivated. Your life expectancy is over 80 years--you have not lived even 1/6th of your life yet. There is so much good stuff to look forward to, believe me.|`|eXSfwkKIaa	if you cant talk to your mom, there are alot of people at your school that should be willing to listen.<br>  <br>  do you have a guidence counsler?<br>  try talking to other adults you trust. they always help =]|`|ZiSmjx6Xaa	Dear 13 year old, I feel for you. Feeling depressed and over whelmed at times can feel be very difficult.  There are many children your age that can not speak with there parents so please don't feel like you're alone. Many parents feel that if they admit to the possiblity that their may be a problem reflects more on their parenting than anything else. You may receive several different ways to cope and I too will try to share some things that have worked for me. Chances are that I am closer to your mothers age but, I do understand.  Trust me on this one thing...life is difficult and these days much more difficult than when I was a young person. At your age you are not only going through physical changes but, mental (chemical) changes as well. I'm certain that you have heard this cliche...Laughter is the best medicine..it's true.  Instead of watching shows on tv that only add to your worries try watching shows that will make you laugh.  Change your diet...it does work and when you start to feel overwhelmed about some thing I get on my tread mill and jog for 15 mins. The endofines released by the brain will honestly make you feel better. Depression can be real but, I also understand where your mother may be coming from.  When I was younger there wasn't a pill for everything...Some of us just did get over it..we had no choice.  You may want to speak with a counselor at school but, they also may not have an answer other than medicine. I would try to speak with clergy. They may offer help that doesn't come from putting a bandade on the cause.  Much of what you feel may just be part of growing up and trust me...we have all gone through it and with the economy the way it is many of us are still going through it.<br>  Best of luck and most of all don't allow yourself to loose hope.|`|qtHFJFvQaa	Having depression and being depressd are 2 very different things that too often get confused in today's society.<br>  <br>  It only makes sense that you're feeling down. Is there a counselor at school you can speak to?<br>  <br>  I imagine that you're mom is a single mother and you probably feel like you don't know who's the mother she or you.
PfEXRZseaa	Hola, mira a un ortodoncista nos toma una media hora para ponerte un solo bracket que se te ha despegado aun teniedo el instrumental, el equipo, la habilidad y el conocimiento para pegar un bracket. Lo primero que tienes que hacer es darle un tratamiento al bracket, o colocar uno nuevo,  hay que quitar todo el arco, despues hay que quitarle la resina al diente, luego saber la posicion exacta del bracket y pegardo con resina especial y finalmente colocar el arco. Si colocas el bracket chueco tu diente se va a ir chuco asi es que si no puedes ir con tu ortodoncista yo te sugiero que le hables por telefono le digas lo que paso y que lo veras en la proxima cita, a la mejor tu tratamiento se retrasa pero no vas a correr otros riesgos.

If your school has a weight lifting team, this seems like a choice option. But you'd need to ask about it first, because many weight lifters' teams ARE competitive and DO run. Are you afraid of sweating, possibly? Running is not the most ideal sport if you consider this. As spring shifts into the year, there is a chance to try out for local swim teams, and you will usually be able to find a local pool with a team. As to non-competitive sports, i don't guess there would be many. Many non-competitive sports do not exercise a considerable amount of muscles (for eg, golf or bowling), but if you invite over a friend or two and play outside a while you will enjoy yourself and get enough exercise (remember the 30-minutes a day slogan?). Biking, jumproping, and hop-scotching all include exercise for those lumpy, large upper legs (this is my problem: I have skinny shins but my thighs are unspeakably large, resulting in a very akward appearance for my lower body). I've recently gotten a pogo stick for under forty dollars, and it certainly did the trick: It wore me out, made me sweat (sweating is healthy, by the way), and was very fun! A few tips? Pogosticks may seem hard to use, but once you get your balance and learn how to pull the pogo stick up with you as you jump, there's no doubt you'll get the hang of it. I seriously suggest pogo sticking, if you havent noticed... 8^o <br>  Anyway, there's many sports to choose from and it's hard to resist competitive sports once you get into it! So good luck finding the right type of exercise for you. I know it's out there. =^D

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

ZY2GT7edaa	make sure your workouts consist of a good mix of cardio and weight lifting, so that you can be toned, but little fat percentage as well. make sure to incorporate fresh veggies and fruits in your diet (fruits when you need some sugar in you), complex carbs for energy, and lean protein to build muscle. if you are craving a drink of something other than water (which u should drink plenty of), drink milk....it has a mix of protein and good carbs and is great after a workout for building muscle and repairing damaged tissues..make sure that if you wanna lose weight, burn more than you eat! keep track of your diet...keep a food journal..and keep track of your workouts as well. if you go on some sort of machine that keep tracks of your caloric spendage, record it in your journal. this way, you can see progress, continue to improve, and gradually challenge yourself more to harder workouts<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|shiiRrcoaa	Frankly, you are not underweight.

Also 152 isn't a bad weight for a guy 5'11.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

25Whzu2waa	Indeed, 'cause they have nothing else to do, so they do endless pushups/situps/squats/etc.<br>  <br>  Although, that routine's not for anyone else, 'cause we've all got other things to do besides working out endlessly . . .|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	just work out and play basketball<br>  and im sure there is some protien in the food they recieve or they could get some protien powder from the outside.. lol|`|DErZDyBQaa	Good genetics and they were probably buff before they went in.
X9QOHRLFaa	well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in|`|03g0WSvZaa	try the Lil Jack workout  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a> its fun and it works|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

mdudtx7zaa	Not likely. I guess you're thinking the sweating thing. At night you're metabolism slows down quite abit and your body temp drops, so the likely hood of this working probably is small, and at night zero to none|`|FaVYRoXqaa	what a dumb idea.
reAtqf0Maa	well sleeping more doens;t magically make you lose weight. but actually the more you exercise in the day, when u sleep you will have more deep sleep and then you will want to exercise because you have rested a lot. it will be a cycle so in a way it can help. and it can also help u lose weight weight because u will be sleeping and you wont get hungry late at night. after sinner eat yogurt because it keeps you full and can help weight loss. (you can use any yogurt you would like!) so in a way it can help!|`|79ab2ac723d6fa6d643348f5a67b7e74aa	That's not true.  Unless you sleep so much that you just aren't eating, you won't lose weight that way.  It's not healthy.<br>  <br>  Getting too little sleep, stress and poor health can cause weight loss; I wouldn't recommend that either.<br>  <br>  I recommend a little earlier to bed and less on weekends.  Stick to a daily routine if possible.  Don't deviate on weekends.  Eat right, exercise, and rest appropriately.  That's all you can do.  Your weight will find a healthy balance.  Make sure that you budget some time for recreation and relaxation.  That too is important.  Study.  Keep your mind active.  Do puzzles.  These things help the body as do good relationships and friendship.  People need activity, relationships, and fun.  We are social creatures.  Don't forget about hugs and handshakes.  For some reason or other physical contact is important to health.  Just make sure your friends are on the same page or it'll just be weird.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|6o4iqjPgaa	no fats at all! a lot of protein! run 1 hour slight inclination, abdominal workout everyday!|`|ICmHPPMhaa	hmmmm i would say eat about 500 calories a day, drink some coffee or diet soda or something to give you an energy boost- but NOT TOO MUCH! also, try and exercise. this is not very healthy at all but i know it can help you get your weight down. i would really suggest giving yourself more time to lose the weight.|`|uXFdeKGPaa	ggym gym gym

Eat healthy..follow the food pyramid (but you don't have to eat EVERYTHING on that thing)<br>  <br>  belly fat, for most people, is something they counter with RUNNIng. the elliptical is a good machine to burn, but running on the treadmill, or just straight running on the road or something is a lot more intense. there is more body movement and you adapt to feeling the slight pounding on the ground as you run. <br>  <br>  ab workouts can help out some should you choose to or are already doing it. it helps to tone out your ab muscles.<br>  <br>  all in all, your best bet to losing that belly fat is to do cardio/fat burn exercise. try 45 mins a day instead of 30...30 is basically just to burn whatever calories you have in your system already. it's AFTER the 30 mins where your body starts to recall from your reserves(your fat..meaning your butt fat..your thigh fat..your belly fat). <br>  <br>  try 45 a day..and maybe try rotating from running to elliptical from day to day or during the workout...for example: half workout run..half workout elliptical.|`|3yiXZ9bnaa	wow lol, the guys above me are just trying to sell you something.

BqqDJXkjaa	You can safely lose 4 kilos (8 pounds?) in 4 weeks. <br>  However, if you crash diet, which is really unhealthy, you could lose as much as you want to. Read about keeping your metabloism up, otherwise you will just put all the weight back on again afterwards.|`|cZ1M59wAaa	1-2 pounds a week is is usually healthiest, but it depends on your metabolism.|`|IrZP7wXkaa	An ideal weight loss for 4 weeks is about 8 pounds.  It's unhealthy  to lose more than 2 lbs. a week.  Be patient though,  it takes time to achieve your goals.  Once you achieve them after all the hard work you've done you will feel great!  However if you do a fad diet of some sort and lose 20 lbs. in a month,  It is much more likely you will just gain it all back.  So take your time, work hard, and stay healthy!|`|k9kmrSHeaa	Just don't eat horrible food, take in healthy food with small portions, two to three times a day. Maybe an apple for breakfast  or a yogurt for lunch/ It's not fun, but being skinny is.
tNsH0yQxaa	Try it somewhere else on your skin and wait 24 hours for any reaction to occur. Maybe your wrist or inside crease of your elbow. If you break out it's an allergic reaction. But the product basically dries out your skin to get rid of excess sebum which is part of what causes pimples and it's probably got some sort of antibacterial chemical in it. Maybe your skin is just too sensitive for the product especially because of your acne, in which case I suggest something more gentle. <br>  <br>  Use a scrub twice a week and a clay mud mask once or twice a week (dries up excess oil and removes impurities). Also make sure you use a cleanser, toner and oil- free moisturiser morning and night, and never leave makeup on overnight. Really you should avoid it when you can - especially foundation because that's the main pore clogger. Another tip - when you wash your face use warm water, then rinse with cold water. Warm releases the dirt and oil, cold stimulates your skin and soothes it.<br>  <br>  Keep your hair off your face (especially forehead) whenever possible, like when you sleep. And also the same old "healthy diet and plenty of water", although I'm sure you've considered that because you've been to a doctor. But it really does help, and it's good to be healthy anyway.<br>  <br>  One more thing, make sure you always read labels on the skin products you buy, if it sounds like it'll be too harsh on your skin go for a lighter option. Finding what's best for your skin can be a bit of trial and error, but once you've found the right combination you'll never look back. Ever considered the contraceptive pill? It can help with acne and there are specific types purely for this... Although that's usually for severe cases.<br>  <br>  Well good luck, hope it gets better!|`|nOrbuan2aa	allergic reaction|`|ERiGmSYvaa	Is like red dots? If it is then yes you are having an allergic reaction.
oP3VVW5raa	Go into Google and look up :<br>  <br>   +iron rich foods+<br>  <br>  and include those suggestions in your diet on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your RBC levels are low enough, ask your family doctor if you could have a series of ferritin injections.  You should only need five injections and they would be spread out over about 10 days.<br>  <br>  Taking iron tablets can be rather binding on your bowel habits.<br>  <br>  Remember, Vitamin C helps the body to absorb iron so stock up on oranges as well.|`|LLW9Pleoaa	red meats like hamburger steak any beef really and green leafy veggies|`|Wn6hnLItaa	Eat Spinach.
Gd6CsEAbaa	your welcome.<br>  <br>  the oximeter reading would definitely be less reliable because decreased circulation secondary to cold would make it hard for oximeter work.  When you are low and wondering if it is reliable ... warm up the extremity and check to see if the heart rate you hear (most oximeters will beep with each heart beat) matches the heart rate you feel (do your oximeter reading and check pulse manually at the same). If they match it is a good indication that the O2 saturation is reliable and you need to intervene as appropriate.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.<br>  <br>  C
xNsJqTgaaa	looks like a proform 585TL but there is no way to say for sure from that picture, There are probably 50 models by a few brands like proform, weslo, lifestyler, image and others made by ICON.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would not buy it unless it's for a kid or a dog.<br>  <br>  These machines were built very cheaply.  Lots of things go wrong and parts are expensive.<br>  <br>  If this treadmill is for an adult, don't buy the cheapest one you can find.  Anything you can buy in a store for less than 500 bucks is basically made for people who will buy them but never use them, if you do use them, you will break them, and with their 90 day warranty, you will pay for the repair.<br>  <br>  I'm not kidding.  If you can't afford a better treadmill, you should just walk or run outside...A wii fit is a better option in my opinion than a super cheap treadmill.

Xp5lgKWOaa	Are you struggling to drop 5, 10 maybe even 20 pounds in less than a month but fear that you won't be able to and you don't want to do a low calorie diet that's going to have all the results come right back. If so then I have a fat loss diet that works, that has received a large amount of praise in the dieting community because it's the first of its kind to help you lose weight quickly and then keep it off for good. Best of all there's no starving, in fact this diet works by eating full meals ever day as I'll explain.<br>  <br>  So what is this diet?<br>  <br>  It's known as calorie shifting and unlike every other diet that focuses on avoiding calories, this diet actually embraces them, however it is the way in which it does which is the reason its so successful. You see calorie shifting utilizes foods as fuel to boost your metabolism believe it or not. In fact it stimulates your metabolism much in the same way that running and exercise does. Except in this case you're just eating according to the calorie shifting diet plan. The problem with other diets is that by having so much focus onto avoiding foods you actually train your metabolism so slow down. Your body does this naturally to keep in a balance, however it doesn't work the other way all the time. So the bad news is that after you finish a low calorie diet the weight begins to pile back on because your metabolism has effectively become shut down.<br>  <br>  With calorie shifting you will never have to worry about this rebound effect because the focus by being placed on boosting your metabolism keeps your body burning fat even once you stop the diet, in some cases for weeks on end. Once this subsides you're left with a return to a normal or slightly above average functioning metabolism and the weight stays off because nothing has been negatively affected by the diet.<br>  <br>  Check out my source, it will surely help. Good luck!|`|wLtY4Sjqaa	You can check out my home workout routine and diet at <a href="http://www.best-bodybuilding-routine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.best-bodybuilding-routine.com</a><br>  <br>  I am a stay at home dad so everything I do is done from home.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|Qzx8CAkoaa	eat  healthy . the junk food does not give your body nutrition. make sure you get enough protein|`|RdZP7S8naa	fried chicken lots of milk and peaches maybe some pizza and hamburgers or some steak ALOT of steak escpecially with bq sauce DONT forget spagnetti some apple cider, turkey, ROAST beef, some bread sticks with marinara sauce some ice cream a little beer NOT ALOT french toast some regular butter toast with a little jam STRAWBERRY JAM and eggs and bacon with some hashbrowns ALSO dont forget some doritos thats the stuff RICE CRISPY TREATS some coaco pebbles or fruity pebbles some gronola bars, choclate pie also some snickers, some cake taco bell AND THE MAIN THING TO EAT TO GAIN WEIGHT IS MC donalds|`|zWCu9GAyaa	Eat late at nite and just before bed,evrynite!<br>  Try peanut butter sandwiches which are loaded with fat!<br>  Along with that,drink milkshakes,thick!<br>  Do that for about a month and see where youre at?|`|4oKJ2I33aa	you need to drink beer =]
ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .

But, why is junk food so bad? Mostly it is due the the high sugar content of junk food. Most junk food consists of refined carbs and sugar, which when eaten quickly raise blood sugar levels, leading to reduction in fat burning and increase in apetite. <br>  <br>  Consumption of carbs is essential, but there are good carbs and bad carbs. Refined flours and the foods that they create can cause bloating, poor digestion, and lead to accumulation of fat. <br>  <br>  Your body cannot metabolize too much carbohydrate at once because the body doesn't need so much energy at once. The excess sugar will just turn into stomach fat. Slow release carbs are also beneficial, such as oats, brown rice, some pulses and sweet potato.<br>  <br>  Avoiding carbs increases fat burning metabolism (lipolysis) which helps to reduce stomach fat. <br>  <br>  Combine your meals with a good combination of protein, carbohydrate and vegetables. Your source of protein should be in a size of a deck of cards; the carbohydrates in a size of your palm and the major bulk of your meals should come from vegetables.<br>  <br>  Try not to have late night snacks. The main problem with late night snacking is that there is not much activity done afterwards. People go straight to bed right after the late night meal because they are tired. So, this will cause high sugar levels in the blood stream and no energy spent after that. The excess sugar will just turn into fat. Losing stomach fat requires a strict diet. <br>  <br>  Decrease that alcohol consumption. If you drink a lot, you will accumulate fat around your waist.<br>  <br>  One gram of alcohol, which is can be calculated as one ml of alcohol contains 7 calories. Even thought the amount of calories is lesser than of fat, alcohol calories are completely useless. Alcohol does not contain any nutrients at all. So, the entire amount of calories consumed through alcohol will be stored as fat! <br>  <br>  Lastesly 30 minutes aerobic exericse and 30 minutes of weight lifting will help u lose stomach fat :)|`|VX0EvSNWaa	Do you need to go on a diet? The Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet is the best diet online. It's highly popular: there are many forums devoted to it. It's worked for other people and it can work for you too.<br>  <br>  1. Do You Binge? You May Be Malnourished and Starving<br>  <br>  One of the big benefits of following a diet program like the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet is that you become familiar with what you should be eating. Many overweight people are actually malnourished and starving. This seems incredible, but it's true.<br>  <br>  If you constantly overeat, it's because you're not getting enough nourishment from the food you're eating. Once you start eating properly you will lose the urge to overeat.<br>  <br>  The Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet provides you with a diet generator which helps you to create your own healthy eating plans. You can avoid foods which you don't like, and you will find that if you follow the diet you've generated yourself, you won't be hungry, but you'll still lose weight.<br>  <br>  Because being on a diet can be boring, you get days off with the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet. Many of the people on the program don't take their days off, but I encourage you to do so. Use your day off the diet to indulge yourself if you wish.<br>  <br>  2. Learn How to Eat Well With the the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet<br>  <br>  Losing weight without a dieting program can be difficult. This is because how,  when, where and what we eat is largely a habit. You get used to eating certain types of foods. This is true for healthy foods as well. Once you realize that you feel much more energetic and happy when you are on the diet, you will stay on the diet long enough for healthy eating to become a habit.<br>  <br>  3. Get Support on Forums: You'll Get Motivated Too<br>  <br>  There are many forums for the Fat Loss 4 Idiots Diet. Join a forum: you can get inspiration and motivation from other people who are also on the diet. Forum members share diet recipes, dieting tips, and lifestyle tips.<br>  <br>  Check my source, hope it'll help.<br>  Good luck!|`|GelbRB8qaa	Couple weight training with lotttts of cardio.  Run/Walk a few miles a day and it'll melt off no matter what you eat.

It would be hard to correlate cancer with exposure to H2O2 but I also wouldn't dismiss it.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of using H2O2 for acne... and would be leary about relying on it for treatment and would turn to topical treatments like tea tree oil, salicyclic acid or benzolyic acid.

You can also use Isopropyl alcohol they will strip your skin of the oil thought so perhaps Witch Hazel might be in your best interest.  To really answer your question though no it won't cause cancer.  My doctor back in high school had prescribed it to me in a aqueous base.  Anything with around 3 percent of salicylic acid in it also makes a good face wash.  10-20minutes of sun a day also helps.  Kicks in some extra vitamin D for ya.  Low stress and a healthy diet also help but are much more a minority in the overall acne regards.

YoITtCbfaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  While you LOVE this doctor, I would strongly suggest getting a NEW doctor.<br>  <br>  If your doctor is not willing to believe and respect your medical history--including ALLERGIES to medications, then you need a new doctor.  What would happen if say--you had a bad illness or injury, and were taken to the hospital and unable to give all your history? The hospital DOES contact your local doctor if they can find that out and GET YOUR meds/allergies/and history from them....IF your doctor is not willing to acknowledge that you are allergic to codeine (and there are a few other pain meds that are related to that allergy, as they have codeine in them), that would be VERY VERY bad.....<br>  <br>  While you CAN sue the doctor, there is now a limitations on how much you can get, and you usually must have actually suffered some kind of injury---depending on the state (please do NOT take the medication you are allergic to in order to qualify, as that would actually NOT make you qualify either for the lawsuit---it would be considered intentional on your part).<br>  <br>  You can possibly contact the medical board....or ask the pharmacist how to go about this....since the doc altered your medical file?<br>  <br>  (I had a nurse practitioner do this to me at an ob-gyn office....it was horrid....suddenly, I had the doc walk in to do a biopsy and I had no idea why!<br>  <br>  I have also had docs deny that my mom could be allergic to prednisone and have her airway swell up while on it--rather fast too--she can take the medication SIMILAR to it--solumedrol, but not PREDNISONE---well, recently, some nurses tried to pull that again, and insist you can not be allergic to one and not the other....long story, she was in the hospital for an unrelated condition, and luckily she was awake enough to argue with them and say NO, she was NOT taking that medication they offered her).<br>  <br>  ---funny thing is, my husband wound up with the same reaction to prednisone, and this was after my mom was allergic to it, but before I even knew my mom had an allergy to it.....yet, these docs keep denying some of these allergies to certain medications.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and I would seriously suggest finding a new doctor, and keeping a list of all allergies to medications AND foods with you at all times (as some food allergies are related to drug allergies--such as egg and diprivan--in the event of sedation in the ER or OR, or SHELLFISH/IODINE and betadine/providine scrub--some hospitals say they do not use them, but they still do for surgeries/some IV access--such as lumbar punctures/spinal anesthesia and for sutures.).<br>  <br>  ---------------------EDITED-----------...<br>  <br>  Ok, I did not realize you did actually GET and TAKE a prescription that was filled from the doc.   I had misunderstood--thinking that he had just written or called in a prescription to the pharmacy, but the drug allergy was caught BEFORE you picked up the medication and took any.<br>  <br>  This definitely changes things...<br>  <br>  In this case, yes, you can contact a lawyer, and yes, you should be able to pursue disiplinary actions against the doctor as well....not sure that you are actually looking to gain monetary gain, as much as make sure he does not do this again, and to recoup your medical costs/lost wages for today.<br>  <br>  IF you pursue legal actions, definitely, find a decent lawyer, do not just go for some lawyer who is looking to make money, or who does "run of the mill" legal stuff...you want someone who has medical/pharmacutical knowledge or a lawyer who handles that kind of legal suits.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|57LFRfqCaa	If your most recent prescription warns not the be taken with a codeine Allergy then why did you take it?  Or are your "most recent prescription" and your "new prescription" two different scripts?|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Few people are actually allergic to codeine but lots of people say they are because it upsets their stomach, so doctors tend not to put a lot of credence in it unless they have actually had a rash or anaphylactic reaction.  Many of the drugs with cousins to codeine can cause a reaction if you're truly allergic, but not necessarily upset your stomach the same way.   If you are truly allergic, make sure you make that clear with codeine.|`|PFCfKKtSaa	If you are 100% sure you have told him you were allergic to codeine and that it'd be in his database, then you could easily sue him.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|H2yac1kUaa	how many pounds is that?|`|86yjOpB5aa	eat not more than 1200 calories a day. try fresh fruit, juice, vegetables. avoid potato, coconut, banana, beef, prawn or pork. <br>  <br>  are you doing any workout? do you exercise? you can try this.<br>  <br>  <br>  it is a 70-75 min workout plan.<br>  <br>  7-10min= stretching<br>  <br>  15-20min= fly,Biceps Curl, Triceps Curl, Forward Arm Raise<br>  (all these=30 repetations)<br>  <br>  20-25min=Basic Crunch, Reverse Curl, Full Crunch, Squats, Rear Leg Lifts<br>  (all these=30 repetations)<br>  <br>  30min= yoga (try 6-8 postures, DO NOT forget to do the Corpse Pose after every pose)<br>  <br>  doing yoga after 30 mins of walking or after any workout is really very very effective for loosing weight.<br>  <br>  if you are very busy and dont have much time to spend 75-80 min for working out then go for a 30min of walking and then do yoga. it works really very fast.<br>  <br>  good luck  xxx|`|RIdVkecAaa	I have your same problem.

To begin is always difficult, but once you've started losing weight and working out, you'd be surprised with the results and it would be much easier from then on. It takes a lot of will power (i'm sure you've been told this already) but exercise and eating healthily is the best way to lose weight. <br>  <br>  Start working out. chose a sport that you enjoy doing. I started off with swimming, but later i found that running was also a great way to keep fit. I started running for 15 minutes then increased to gradually to forty five minutes. I started to build up endurance, and now i run a mile everyday. I time myself when i run so that i can keep track of my progress and it is a great way to keep motivated. start off then once you have been accustomed to regular exercise, try to push further. <br>  <br>  Eat healthily. DON,T GO ON A CRASH DIET. it is most important to keep healthy so that your body can get used to its condition gradually. Try to stick to three meals a day. cut down on fatty foods such as junk food and sweets. Make better choices with food, leave out oily foods. replace an unhealthy snack like a chocolate bar with a fruit. Pay attention to calories and make sure to keep a balance. <br>  <br>  keep an eye on your weight and you will reach your goal pretty soon. Good luck!|`|0RgIOLOLaa	start by not eating white bread, eat wholemeal instead. Also if your big on the soda, if you stop you will lose a few kilos in a couple of weeks. Soda water will help.

And if I flex the muscles - the stomach goes absolutely flat - but that's no help, because you can't really walk around constantly aware that you have to hold your tum in :-) I think it's due to the foods you eat - some foods don't agree with each other and cause bloating. but I think this is individual combination for everyone - since most of us have food intolerances, but don't know about it. I suggest you go to a dietician to find out what foods are good for you - but i've given up, because I'm no good at sticking to a diet. Could be useful to check your digestive system - there is a slight chance that you got a problem there. <br>  Good luck!

Even in Wal*Mart (the worlds lowest price retailer) Slim Fast isn't cheap.  I once heard a college health prof. say that people usually lose 2-3 pounds a week.  In general you should spend 1-2 hours at the gym a day, 2-4 times a week.  <br>  <br>  I'm dieting and working-out each week, and I'm making more progress than when I last tried slim fast. There are directions and weight lose plan you have to stick to, when doing the slim fast diet.  it's on the back of the slim fast boxes.  Even if you follow the Slim Fast diet, it still doesn't work.  I'm so sorry for trying Slim Fast, I've wasted over 20 dollars on that crap.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Slimfast gives you a lot of protein for energy.

Dump anything processed. Dump soft drinks. All are empty calories which your body just stores as they have no nutritional value i.e. it can't use them for anything other than a store of energy.<br>  <br>  Drink chilled water instead of tea, soft drinks etc. Drink only unsweetened black coffee - not decaf. - it boosts metabolism.<br>  Diet needs to be good quality carbs like rice, pasta, wholemeal bread etc. Anything with sugar in it is garbage to a dieter. <br>  <br>  If you can work out before breakfast, all the better. Have a cup of black coffee and train for at least 30-40mins (any less doesn't get the body to adapt enough to the stimulus).<br>  <br>  Eat at least 1500-2000 good calories from a balanced diet. Veggies will fill you up more without adding lots of calories.<br>  <br>  Keys to burning fat: <br>  1. you have to feel slightly hungry all the time. If you don't your body has no reason to boost your energy usage with your bodyfat stores.<br>  2. you have to exercise to burn fat! Your body will just hang on to it's fat stores if you just reduce your calories without exercise because it thinks it's starving, and your muscle mass burns calories even when at rest, which if you don't exercise your body will get rid of to reduce calorie expenditure.<br>  3. Complex unprocessed foods take longer to digest and will not get stored as easily as sugary processed stuff.<br>  4. Eat more smaller meals. Your stomach distends to accept large portions. It WILL get smaller if you eat smaller portions. It also means you are not giving your body more than it needs at each sitting, but are giving it enough to not think it's starving.<br>  5. work out using interval training programmes - they push the body higher and produce a greater chemical effect than static level workouts<br>  6. Sleep! Growth hormone is secreted in the brain during deep sleep - it is one of the main hormones responsible for muscle mass and fat deposition.<br>  7. Perseverence. Stick with it. You will not be a size 00 overnight. It takes time. Don't count the days, just make it part of your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8fc62582c93a068476faf7e02c7aa0abaa	drink green tea and water, and take zantrax 3.|`|93b997b8aa88a5134b102a1348dffa68aa	hi<br>  You don't say when the dance is?

AA12085566	OK….let’s get to the guts of this issue.<br>  <br>  First of all, I AM a convicted felon.  I was convicted of a theft after a 4 day trial in 1992.  My conviction – a felony conviction with 8 years probation and 30 days in a “half-way” house.<br>  <br>  Regardless of my conviction, everyone….EVERYONE….. has committed a felony.  The real issue is – have you been caught or not?  My mother used to cheat on her taxes in her early 20s.  My father used to drive home from the saloons/bars after work.  My brother, in high school, used to sell small amounts of drugs to the jocks. Today, he is a lawyer.   My college professor admitted to stealing cars as a young punk in the 60s.  EVERYONE, one way or another, has committed one or more felonies.  EVERYONE.  The question is….has everyone been caught?  No.  Of course not.  So some people have the stigma of being “convicted felons” and others, in my opinion, are lucky and get to point the finger as the “felons.”<br>  <br>  But whatever….who really cares.<br>  <br>  But when it comes to getting a job……don’t play the victim.  As a felon, you made someone or something else the victim.  Now that your time in jail or probation has passed you by, don’t even think about complaining.  You are in this mess due to YOUR actions, like it or not.<br>  <br>  Felons get jobs all the freaking time.  For a while, after my conviction, I had a slew of jobs – <br>  <br>  a.Delivering newspapers from 2:30 am to 5:30 am.  ($200 a week)<br>  b.Washed dishes for $7.00/hour every mid-day.  ($150 a week)<br>  c.Waited tables as a waiter every evening. ($150.00 a week)<br>  <br>  I didn’t sleep much, but three part time jobs paid me $25,000 a year.  I didn’t see my wife much, except on the weekends.  But I made an ‘acceptable’ living and paid my bills.<br>  <br>  After a while, my paper delivery job collided with my dish washing job, so I got a different job during the day – working as a general laborer for Labor Ready ($30 a day).<br>  <br>  While working the three jobs, I also applied to numerous job applications in the Sunday paper, on Monster.com and on career builders.com.  Every week or so, I would get a “bite.”  Someone would call or email with interest in hiring me.  I would ask – “What are the requirements?  Drug test?  Background check?  Credit Check?”   Most people would say – “Yes, a background check and drug test.”<br>  <br>  But, you know what?  Sometimes….every now and then, someone would say – <br>  <br>  “No….no background check, but we do test all applicants for drugs.”   Once I heard that, I would work very, very, very hard to get that job.<br>  <br>  After a year of working three jobs and sending resumes, I was hired.  My salary - $32,000.  I said ‘goodbye’ to Labor ready, delivering newspapers….but still waited tables (part time) on weekend evenings.  That gave me another $50.00 a week.  The extra $200.00 a month is great way to pay for pizzas, sushi, renting videos, buying subway sandwiches, postage stamps, etc.<br>  <br>  See?  It can be done.  It merely takes the continuous effort.<br>  <br>  Stop playing a victim.  You CAN do it.  Never complain or condemn.  Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and get to work.<br>  <br>  There are lots of Felons (ex-cons) out there who work every single day.  According to the government, there are 15 million of us.  Being one of the ‘working folks’is EASY.<br>  <br>  Get to work!  <br>  <br>  David<br>  <br>  P.S. – I’m not going to say “Good luck” because I believe that you MAKE your own luck.  Don’t ‘have a great day’.  MAKE IT a great day.|`|95cbc9209753f30fabca820890c6def4aa	JUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND DO NOT LET ANYBODY TALK YOU OUT OF YOUR DREAMS.

Wasserbetten sich absolut dem K?rper anformen und daher super sind. Aber warum soll das denn gut sein? OK, es h?rt sich gut an, aber...<br>  <br>  Das Problem, da? ich sehe, ist doch, da? der K?rper wie in einer Art Gips gehalten wird, also eine Art Korsett, die passen sich dem K?rper auch 100% an -und das eine ganze Nacht lang! Wenn was gebrochen ist, dann ist das OK, es SOLL ja ruhig gehalten werden. Aber nachts gibt es natürliche K?rperbewegungen, und da soll nicht sowas Waberiges dem im Wege stehen! Die K?perbewegungen sind absolut wichtig, wenn die eingeschr?nkt werden, gibt es früher oder sp?ter Probleme: Schlafhaushalt, Nervenkostüm, Psyche, Bluthochdruck etc. Früher dachte man vielleicht, das Beste bei Rückenbeschwerden w?re Bettruhe und Schonung, heute sind sich alle Orthop?den einig, da? es das Gegenteil ist! Eine Ruhigstellung im Wasserbett ist das Allerdümmste, was man machen kann, aber sicher nicht die geringste Geldausgabe.

AA11144245	well, here's some helpful information on causes & symptoms of headaches. hope it's helpful to you!!<br>  <br>  The most common types of headaches usually are not serious but may occur again and again.<br>  <br>  --Tension headaches -- the most common type of headache and are episodes of constant aching, tightness, pressure, and pain around the forehead, temples, or back of the head and neck. Symptoms usually occur on both sides of the head rather than just one side. <br>  Tension headaches usually do not stop a person from doing his or her regular activities. These headaches usually do not cause nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or noise. A tension headache can last anywhere from 30 minutes to several days. Some people experience chronic tension headaches, which means they get a headache on 15 or more days a month.<br>  Tension headaches are related to muscles tightening in the back of the neck or head because of stress, anxiety, fatigue, hunger, anger, poor posture, or overexertion.<br>  Treatment for tension headaches usually includes aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonprescription pain relievers. Aspirin should not be given to anyone age 20 years or younger because it has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious disease that most often affects children. Prescription medications, such as antidepressants, may be needed to treat tension headaches. Additional therapies, including stress management or biofeedback, may reduce or prevent tension headaches<br>  <br>  --Cluster headaches -- these are recurring headaches that occur in groups or cycles. The headaches appear suddenly and cause severe, debilitating pain on one side of the head, along with a watery eye and nasal congestion on the affected side of the head. The cause of cluster headaches is unknown. Although there is no cure for cluster headaches, medications can reduce the frequency and duration of the painful headaches.<br>  --Migraine headaches -- Approximately one-third of people who have migraine headaches first began having them as teenagers. are painful, sometimes disabling headaches that are often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, noise, and smell. These throbbing headaches usually occur on only one side of the head, although the pain can shift from one side of the head to the other, or can occur on both sides at the same time. Migraines involve changes in chemicals and blood vessels in the brain, which trigger pain signals leading to headache and other symptoms.<br>  Migraine headaches tend to recur. A migraine headache typically lasts 4 to 24 hours but in some cases can last up to 3 days. Some people have symptoms, such as visual disturbances, that occur before a headache starts. These symptoms are called a migraine aura.<br>  Some people have several headaches per month; others have headaches much less often. Treatment usually includes medications to prevent a migraine from occurring or to stop a migraine once it begins. In some people, migraines may be triggered by certain foods or smells. Eliminating exposure to these triggers may stop the headaches.<br>  <br>  Here's a list of common causes of headaches include:<br>  <br>  --Alcohol, caffeine, or other drug use or withdrawal. <br>  --Changes in the levels of chemicals in the body (neurotransmitters). <br>  --Coughing or sneezing. <br>  --Dehydration. <br>  --Dental problems or procedures, such as pain from grinding the teeth or from a root canal. <br>  --Eating or drinking cold foods and fluids. <br>  --Emotional stress. <br>  --Exposure to smoke or fumes from chemicals, including carbon monoxide. <br>  --Eyestrain. <br>  --Fever. <br>  --High altitude. Lower oxygen levels at high altitudes can cause headaches. <br>  --Medical procedures, such as the aftereffects of a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). <br>  --Medications. Many medications can cause headaches. <br>  --Muscle strain in the neck, upper back, or shoulder muscles. <br>  --Upper respiratory infections. <br>  <br>  If you have headaches, with these serious symptoms, definitely consult a doc!<br>  Although rare, a headache may be a sign of a serious illness. Other symptoms, such as vomiting, dizziness, or changes in vision, may also be present. The following serious illnesses or injuries can cause headaches.<br>  --A head injury: <br>  --Injury to the brain <br>  --Fracture of the skull <br>  --Bleeding in or around the brain <br>  --Brain tumor, which causes swelling within the brain. <br>  --Infection in the brain (encephalitis) or of the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). <br>  --Stroke, a problem that occurs when a blood vessel (artery) that supplies blood to the brain bursts or is blocked by a blood clot. <br>  --A rupture of a blood vessel with bleeding in or around the brain (aneurysm) <br>  <br>  Other health conditions that can cause or contribute to headaches include:<br>  <br>  --Alcohol, caffeine, or drug abuse, overuse, or withdrawal. <br>  --Fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread muscle and soft tissue pain and tenderness. <br>  --Glaucoma, an eye disease that damages the nerves at the back of the eye. <br>  --High blood pressure (hypertension). <br>  --High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). <br>  --Infection in the sinuses, such as sinusitis or an abscess. <br>  --Inflammatory problems , such as arthritis, lupus, or temporal arteritis. <br>  --Kidney disease, which causes wastes to build up in the blood. <br>  --Low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcemia) or overactivity of the gland that helps control the release of calcium into the blood (hyperparathyroidism). <br>  --Lyme disease, a bacterial infection spread by certain types of ticks. <br>  --Mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression. <br>  --Problems with pregnancy, such as severe high blood pressure (preeclampsia). <br>  --Sleep problems, such as insomnia or sleep apnea. <br>  --Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism (if you want to learn more about thyroid, please contact me...I have seceral best answers for thyroid problems)<br>  **PLEASE NOTE**<br>  Headache with signs of serious illness!!<br>  <br>  When a headache, vomiting, fever, or a seizure occurs along with another serious illness, immediate medical care is needed. Signs of serious illness include:<br>  <br>  --A sudden, severe headache. <br>  --Confusion or extreme irritability. <br>  --Extreme sleepiness. <br>  --New and different skin rash or severe bruises. <br>  --New double vision, blurred vision, or blind spots. <br>  --Persistent nausea or vomiting. <br>  --Rapid, difficult breathing. <br>  --Severe neck stiffness or pain. <br>  --Severe sensitivity to light (photophobia). <br>  --Severe pain. <br>  --Unsteadiness that prevents standing or walking (ataxia or vertigo). <br>  Although uncommon, a headache with signs of a serious illness may be a sign of:<br>  <br>  --An infection in or around the brain, such as encephalitis, meningitis, or a brain abscess. <br>  --A momentary blockage of a blood vessel (transient ischemic attack, or TIA) in the brain. <br>  --Rupture of a blood vessel in the brain.|`|dd17d35c34348e6d4aecf389b045ab59aa	all people have a different reaction to pain relievers. ibuprofen works on me, well, unless i have a migraine. then i need something from the doctors and that stuff works but makes you moody. try goody's or Excedrin or Advil. if those don't work then seek your doctors advice!!! <br>  <br>  53 seconds ago <br>  Edit   Delete|`|69d0719ebef0246f48c9249c1e6a2bfcaa	take some Vaseline.

AA10015249	the master cleanser by stanley burroughs is the nastiest thing around. It is a very disgusting drink made with lemons, water ,maple syrup (organic) and cayenne pepper ,You also need to use a herbal laxative tea during this peocess. It is the most disgusting tasting stuff and can see how a person would lose weight tho as this is replusive and is a great aide in making one vomit for sure.Why not eat some whole foods instead (ya know friuts ,veggies ,grains ,beans etc real foods ),stay away from processed sugary, chemically concocted garbage,lay off saturated fat . Your body will have something to work with to keep your matabolism going ,something good to digest.Watch those servin sizes and get some cardio excercise everyday (at least a half hr daily ( biking ,walking,running, areobic workout ) and i gaurantee you will lose weight and look and feel great .Throw in some strength training 3 times a week and you'll tone up and be building muscle to burn the fat which in turn will make that fat loss happen even faster .Your body is designed to live on food not liqiud alone, There are no quick fixes (not healthy ones ) to weightloss.you have to change your lifestlye and get up and move. You did'nt gain the weight in a month and you won't lose it all in a month .However good healthy fat loss in an average of 3 lbs a week .Think about that 12 lbs a month 24 lbs in 2 months ,Slow steady weightloss that will stay off as long as you stick with a healthy lifestyle good luck to you .|`|61a08eb8e5ac2510f4be0be70f94cbf8aa	The word, moron, is TRIED.

138f314bc6698e55bbcb1eedde51181caa	Es gibt viele Krankheiten, gegen die es kein Mittel gibt. Leider. AIDS ist die bekannteste, weil in aller Munde. Es gibt kein Mittel gegen Grippe, Vogelgrippe (Tamiflu hilft nur in den ersten 48 Stunden und das auch nur bei ca 40 % der Leute), die meisten Krebsarten, fast alle Autoimmunkrankheiten, viele Hautkrankheiten ... ach eigentlich geht es schneller die paar Krankheiten aufzuz?hlen, die wir wirklich heilen k?nnen.<br>  <br>  Die moderne Medizin hilft dabei, Krankheiten zu behandeln, zu verhindern, aber heilen kann sie immer noch nicht alle. <br>  <br>  AIDS wird ausgel?st durch das HI-Virus.

Lors de cet achat, devant contracter un emprunt, j'ai également eu la surprise de voir l'agent bancaire, un homme jeune ( 25 ans au plus), s'entêter à m'appeler "Mademoiselle" après avoir eu connaissance de ma déclaration d'imp?ts, alors que je lui avais bien signifié que ce n'était pas l'appellation que je souhaitais avoir. <br>  <br>  Ayant collecté les informations existant à ce propos (circulaires de la Fonction Publique FP 900 et FP1172, qui reconnaissent le droit à l'appellation "Madame" aux "mères célibataires"- et non aux "femmes célibataires" - réponse ministérielle 5128 du 3 mars 1983 JO Sénat du 14 avril 1983 - plus complète mais sans valeur de texte applicatif, j'ai bien eu confirmation que l'usage "Mademoiselle" n'était fondé sur aucun texte législatif, et qu'une femme, quel que soit son age ou son statut - mariée, célibataire, mère ou sans enfant- peut, de son plein droit, être appelée "Madame Nom de naissance". <br>  <br>  Ce thème m'interpellant, et m'étonnant que l'usage Mademoiselle persiste, malgré la réponse ministérielle- qui date de plus de 20 ans -, j'ai discuté à ce propos avec d'autres femmes célibataires. Certaines apprécient de se faire appeler Mademoiselle, qui les renvoie à leur valeur de "fra?cheur consommable" et leur confirme qu’elles sont encore désirables ou encore fertiles, sans se rendre compte qu'elles perpétuent ainsi la soumission aux valeurs machistes : la femme désignée dans sa valeur d'objet , objet "sexuel" ou "ventre porteur".<br>  <br>  D'autres auraient le sentiment, avec l’intitulé ? Madame ?, d'usurper le nom de leur mère (mariée) - ce qui n'est pas un problème pour les hommes et le nom de leur père (marié). Il faut donc en conclure que l'usage a créé une tradition qui profite au sexisme et à la discrimination des femmes, puisque l'usage du Mademoiselle signifie que l'on confère une valeur différente à la femme, selon qu'elle est ou pas mariée et/ou mère, valeur qui s'exprime par un diminutif: "oiselle" (désigne une ? jeune fille niaise ? dans le dictionnaire Robert). <br>  <br>  D'ailleurs, "mademoiselle" était utilisé dans les films des années soixante pour désigner les vendeuses ou les bonnes, mêmes mariées, ou bien les secrétaires (aujourd'hui encore). <br>  <br>  Comment se fait-il que tant de personnes - femmes et hommes confondus - ignorent en 2006 <br>  <br>  · que l'identité, en droit fran?ais, est fondée uniquement par le nom de naissance (nom patronymique) et le prénom ; <br>  <br>  · qu' existe le droit pour tous de demander à porter en plus un ? nom d'usage ? réunissant le nom du père et de la mère ; ce qui permettrait aux jeunes ? filles ? qui le souhaitent de se différencier de leur mère, avec l'intitulé "Madame" – au fait, on devrait dire ? jeunes femmes ?, car parle-t-on de jeune ? fils ? ? il est vrai que le féminin de ? gar?on ?, la ? garce ?, ni ? fille de ? ses parents, ni ? femme de ? l’homme, a de quoi rebuter ;<br>  <br>  · pour les personnes qui se marient (hommes et femmes indifféremment), la possibilité - mais en aucun cas l'obligation légale - d'adjoindre le nom de leur conjoint(e) à leur nom de naissance. (JO n° 153 du 3/07/1986, pp 8245 à 8247) <br>  <br>  Quant à l’usage du? mademoiselle ?, qui date de l'époque médiévale , il ferait sourire si on le rendait symétrique : appeler "Mon Damoiseau" un homme célibataire ...<br>  <br>  Le choix Madame/Mademoiselle implique qu’une femme donne des indications sur son état de disponibilité, en particulier sexuelle : la bo?te aux lettres n’a pas vocation d’agence matrimoniale…<br>  <br>  Conclusion:<br>  <br>  Nom patronymique et/ou nom matronymique, nom d'usage, voilà les seules rubriques pertinentes pour les formulaires administratifs, au lieu de "Nom "/ "Nom de jeune fille"<br>  <br>  Madame, Monsieur, pour désigner le sexe.<br>  <br>  Un point c'est tout, pour être conforme au droit fran?ais <br>  <br>  On s'étonne que si peu de femmes parviennent à des postes de pouvoir, mais l'aptitude au pouvoir s'apprend dès les premières années de la vie, et le terme "mademoiselle" traduit un regard ? diminutif ? sur nos filles, qui fait d’elles de ? petites choses ? pas finies, jamais vraiment autonomes, qui n'accèderont à leur état d’adulte que lorsqu'elles "trouveront un mari" ou "seront mères d’un enfant ?. Comment voulez vous qu'elles n'intègrent pas la soumission à leur r?le d’épouse ou de mère comme une donnée normale et nécessaire ? Une des fonctions du Droit, c'est de créer des règles capables de dépasser les données biologiques qui nous conditionnent. L'égalité juridique ne signifie aucunement négation des différences. <br>  <br>  Peut-être trouverez vous que c'est une question de détail, de vocabulaire, mais c'est aux mots utilisés que l'on reconna?t l'esprit d'un groupe social : la tolérance du "mademoiselle" n'est pas cohérente avec la volonté affichée d'une parité professionnelle hommes/femmes. <br>  <br>  Alors, à quand le texte applicatif publié au J.O pour l'abolition du "Mademoiselle" et son corollaire, ? Nom de jeune fille ?, dans les imprimés administratifs ? Les USA et la Grande-Bretagne nous ont devancé sur ce terrain.|`|277e38c0a7e8b7b1bb1ef32a59b2af7eaa	Si l'on y réfléchit, tu dis n'importe quoi, non?|`|348ddf08fb60c75f82203971843f65e4aa	T'as pas tout à fait tort !|`|6817175cef78a9e59660b1db0fdb6bf3aa	Non, chier à l'envers, c'est "reihc"...|`|8a704d7cc83616048e93994b3994972caa	tu sais ce qui le plus dr?le, ce que tu te retrouve avec ta question dans la rubrique "fitness, dietetique"|`|ebea3001e1d68ddc2bd1900639d0179eaa	t'as du en bouffer de la merde pour dire ca

AA10522992	There's nothing really effective other than eating right and doing more exercise. Face the reality. Perhaps you can eat more vegetables and less meat less junk food. That's all I can suggest but take no pills and do not go dieting. Good luck<br>  <br>  But if you change your mind and wish to take advantage of any work-out, just do aerobics with some resistant exercise but mainly aerobics burn your fat.<br>  <br>  People will try to tell you how to reduce fat just from your tommy and that's called spot reduction and it never works, trust me and read this about myth of spot reduction:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myfit.ca/archives/viewanarticle.asp?table=fitness&ID=57" rel="nofollow">http://www.myfit.ca/archives/viewanartic...</a><br>  <br>  One more thing, do not eat less because it will slow down your metabolism, moreover, if you are going to do more exercise than you used to why eat less? Your body will need more food to replace the resources you expend. It's the kind of food and eating pattern determines you're going to be fitter or not but never the amount. For instance, if you take excessive protein at one time, they will go out as waste so counting calories is not accurate enough.|`|65a88ad044b5ba1b20ac1f5c311887fcaa	The way I got my tummy and legs (and arms and butt and back) too look fantastic was latin dance.

Ensure that the energy provided by the food you eat matches the energy you burn performing your daily activities.You can reduce belly fat by doing activities like walking swimming and rowing. Such activities help in supplying enough oxygen to the body to burn fat.More info at  <a href="http://www.toloseweight.org/losestomachfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.toloseweight.org/losestomachf...</a>|`|AA11268378	You know...I didn't take ANY pills and by changing my lifestyle, I lost 54 lbs!  You can see my before and after pic here <a href="http://www.healthandstrength.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandstrength.net</a><br>  <br>  This is what I did and still do every day to keep myself fit and healthy.  Hopefully they can help you too!!!<br>  <br>  1. NEVER EVER ate sugar. It's a poison that makes us older, sicker, fatter and tired...all things we dont want. Seriously, sugar is the one who does the dirty work in weight gain. Stop eating it all together. You can see my list of ingredients to avoid when shopping here <a href="http://www.healthandstrength.net/qofweeka.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandstrength.net/qofweek...</a><br>  2. Drink ALOT of water. 2-3 liters a day. The more the merrier!  We need about half our body weight in ounces JUST for regular body functions!  When you feel thirsty, that means you are already dehydrated and lose brain function.  Water flushes toxins from your fat cells and keeps you younger.<br>  3. Exercise!!! So very important. Here <a href="http://www.healthandstrength.net/abexe.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandstrength.net/abexe.h...</a> are my favorite ab exercises.  I also do cardio 4-5 days a week for about 30 minutes a time.<br>  4. Eat less. How many calories do you think is in that burger or that plate of fries or in that handful of chips. What about overfilling our plates? If you go here <a href="http://www.healthandstrength.net/qofweek.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandstrength.net/qofweek...</a> I wrote something about saving on calories and losing weight.<br>  5. Go to sleep before 10pm. Your body starts repairing and rebuilding and speeding up weight loss while you sleep only if you sleep at about 10pm. If you are awake and go to bed at 12, you miss out on that very important time. I have a good article on my site here <a href="http://www.healthandstrength.net/qofweekb.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandstrength.net/qofweek...</a> that talks about the importance of sleep and how STRESS can make actually make you fatter.<br>  6. BE POSITIVE. Be thankful every day and love yourself<br>  7. BE CONSISTANT! That I think is the KEY to losing weight. So what if you went a week and only lost a pound...or didnt lose any...KEEP going. DON'T stop. This is a lifelong commitment, so stick to it and one day you will open your eyes and need a new wardrobe!<br>  8. Eat more veggies and skinny friendly foods. I have my list of my top ten foods that I ate to lost weight here <a href="http://www.healthandstrength.net/tenfoods.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandstrength.net/tenfood...</a><br>  80% veggies at every meal including breakfast will keep you young and help you lose weight. <br>  9. Do the little things that count!  Check out 10 cool ideas that you can do to help boost your calorie burn throught the day here: <a href="http://www.healthandstrength.net/tips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandstrength.net/tips.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and don't forget that YOU are the only one who decides what foods enter your body and how long you sit around.  Make the change, take the chance and give yourself time!  You can do it.  I know you can!|`|AA12080915	Yes, what u see the fat in and around ur tummy is nothing but the over all fat. The fat in the body accumulates in sedentary areas like tummy and butts.<br>  <br>  So, when we go for tummy reduction one has to treat the whole body. There is no work out to reduce only tummy. So, treat the body as a whole and do the work out.<br>  <br>  Most people or instructors will tell u to do countless abs crunches. Beware of those kind of instructions as these work out will not do good enough to reduce the tummy on the other hand it will lead you a permanent low back ache.<br>  <br>  You can rely on moderate weight training and aerobics. That will enhance your BMR and the fat reduction will take place in your body.<br>  <br>  Care should be taken to avoid fatty food.

Welcome to the Q and A part of the site. Here's a chance to get answers to your questions without actually having to ask them out loud. There's also a list of other resources at the end of the section. If you're still thirsting for knowledge, talk with a parent, teacher or other trusted adult.<br>  <br>  * When will I get my first period?<br>  * Good question. Most girls get their first period between the ages of 9 and 16. Most means the majority - not everyone will fall into this category. Anyway, it follows the development of breasts, hips, waist, pubic hair, and a growth spurt. Put those clues together and they usually add up to imminent period alert. In addition, a girl will often weigh at least 100 pounds before menstruation begins. Genetics also plays a role. If possible, find out when your mom got her first period to get an estimate of when yours may arrive.<br>  * What will happen when I get my first period?<br>  * Usually a first period is very light. It will probably be a few spots of bright red blood or a brown sticky stain that shows up on your underpants. If you are out in public and don't have a pad with you, don't panic. Remain calm. This is a time when true female bonding occurs. Hopefully, your mother or other adult relative will be close by and can supply you with a feminine product. If not, try Plan B. Ask a friend or other woman if she has a pad. It's a well-kept secret that every woman at some time in her life has had to ask another woman for a pad. Yes, it's embarrassing, but you can rely on other women to see you through this situation. And in all honesty, first periods were designed really well because it is usually so little that it won't seep through to your outer clothes.<br>  * How long will my period last?<br>  * Everyone is different. It can last between two and seven days. Most girls have it for about five days.<br>  * What should I do when I get my first period?<br>  * In addition to what's covered above, it's a good idea to have feminine products ready for that first period, and to know how to use them. (See the Kotex products section of our site for more information about these products.)<br>  * What if I get my period at school?<br>  * If you have a pad with you, go to the girls' room and put it on. If you don't have one, go to the school nurse, the office, or wherever you can get a pad. How about keeping a pad at school in case of emergency? If you don't need it, maybe one of your friends will and she can return the favor some day soon.<br>  * What if my flow is really heavy and I have to use lots of pads?<br>  * It's probably just a heavy flow, which can happen during a period's first day or two. Some girls normally experience a heavy flow. If you have a prolonged heavy flow, call your doctor.<br>  * Will I have to stop activities such as sports when I have my period?<br>  * No. These days it's hard to use a period as an excuse to get out of gym class. Believe it or not, the more active you are, the less likely you are to have cramps. And, if you're worried about leaking during sports activities, check out the Kotex products section of the website to find out how to help prevent leaks by using a pad or tampon that fits you and your period.<br>  * How often will I get my period?<br>  * Cycles range anywhere between 21 to 45 days. The average is 28 days. At first, it will probably be irregular. The time between when you get it, the length and time you have it, and the amount of flow will all vary. As your body finds its own internal rhythm, your period will settle into a pattern. It can take a year or two. Mark your periods on a calendar to get used to following your cycle.<br>  * Can I go swimming when I have my period?<br>  * Yes, but don't wear a pad. It will swell up like an inflatable raft. If you want to swim, you should wear a tampon. But first, talk it over with your parent or other responsible adult before trying this (the tampon, not the swimming).<br>  <br>  Please see Questions and Answers about Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Or, check out Important Information about Toxic Shock Syndrome.<br>  * Can I take a bath when I have my period?<br>  * Yes. In fact, a bath or a shower is really important at this time to keep you clean and to fight off any odors that may occur.<br>  * Will getting my period hurt?<br>  * The actually bleeding part doesn't hurt. The menstrual cramps are uncomfortable but manageable.<br>  * What do cramps feel like?<br>  * You've probably already guessed this, but cramps don't feel good. Cramps are a pain. And they're particularly a pain around the area of the uterus that is below your belly button. Sometimes they lodge in your lower back. Cramps are caused by the uterus contracting. You can get them just before and during your period. Some girls have a few cramps, some have lots, and then there are those who have none. The intensity of the cramps varies, and you may not get them every time you have your period. They can be managed with over the counter pain relief medication. Ask your doctor for more information.<br>  * What is menstruation, anyway?<br>  * This is strictly a biological explanation so hold on. Menstruation is your monthly opportunity to create a baby. When your body first becomes able to produce a child, usually between the ages of 9 and 16, it begins preparation once a month for possible motherhood. This time in your life is known as menarche ("muh-NAE-key"). A tiny egg matures in one of your ovaries, then travels down a fallopian tube toward your uterus. Your uterus, meanwhile, has been preparing for the egg's arrival, and its lining has gotten thick and velvety. If the arriving egg is fertilized by a sperm, your uterus is all set to protect and nourish the developing baby for the next nine months. If the egg doesn't get fertilized - because there is no sperm present, then your uterus has no use for that thick, spongy lining. So it sheds the lining and flushes it out - along with some blood, body fluids, and the disintegrated egg. For 2 to 6 days each month, all this stuff flows out of your body through your vagina as reddish-brown menstrual flow. After the onset of menstruation, you'll usually have a menstrual period about every 28 days (except during pregnancy) although your cycle may vary anywhere from 20 to 35 days. Flash forward about 40 years, when your body enters menopause. Your ovaries stop producing eggs and your periods stop.<br>  * What does it mean if my period is late or irregular?<br>  * Irregular periods for the first couple of years are normal. But, after that, when you've started to menstruate regularly, missing a period may be a sign of pregnancy (if you are sexually active). Other causes of irregularity include a change in diet, increase in exercise or drug use. The best advice is to chat with your health care provider if you're concerned.<br>  * Will other people know I'm having my period?<br>  * When you're having your period, you don't want the world to know. Regular bathing, proper use of pads and/or tampons and loose, comfortable clothes are a good strategy to keep your period from sticking out in a crowd.<br>  * Why do I feel crabby and sad right before my period?<br>  * PMS. Those three little letters pack a punch, don't they? Moodiness, anxiety and depression are all part of premenstrual syndrome's big bag o' tricks. Again, some women don't get PMS and no guy on the planet "gets" PMS. So if you're suffering with headaches, backaches, pimples, nausea and food cravings, call a friend, the kind who will understand, and talk about it. She may have some advice on ways to find relief. Or, visit "lets talk" to chat with other girls who might be going through the same thing.<br>  * What causes PMS and why do I feel so darn fat?<br>  * PMS symptoms are caused by hormonal changes that take place prior to menstruation. As hormone levels even out, PMS symptoms gradually disappear. The emotions and problems that seemed overwhelming suddenly feel manageable. Get to know your cycle and you will know when to head off PMS.<br>  <br>  As for the "fat thing." Here's the skinny. Just before and during your period, your body tends to retain water. This added fluid might make you feel bloated or your breasts feel tender. It's normal to gain a couple pounds during this time of the month - and ditch them when your period is over. If you feel like a water balloon, pull on some loose, comfortable clothing. Don't even think about using a pair of pliers to pull up the zipper on your favorite jeans. It's not worth the discomfort. Avoiding salt immediately before and during your period is also a good idea. Salt increases water retention.<br>  * What if I bleed through my clothes?<br>  * Ick. Ick. Ick. And it has happened to almost every woman. First step is damage control. Tie a sweater or jacket around your waist or untuck your shirt. If that's not an option, have a good friend walk directly behind you on the way to the bathroom. Find the closest tampon or pad. When you get to the bathroom, check to see if you can blot out any noticeable spots. If it's a hopeless situation, take a trip to the nurse's office and see if someone can bring you a change of clothes from home. If you are at work or out shopping, try to call it a day and head home. Soaking your underwear or other clothes in cold water and using a stain remover can usually get out any blood stains. O.k., now an important word about preventing this from ever, ever, ever happening again. Being proactive can keep this from being a worst-day-ever type of situation. In the future, stash an extra pair of underwear in your locker and wear dark clothes on days when you're expecting your period or when your flow is at its heaviest. Plan on changing your feminine product on a regular basis. Don't wait until it's too late because you're busy. Wear the right product for your flow.

And do you go back to having the same kind of cycle as before pregnancy? Friends have told me that after childbirth, cramps are lessened. <br>  Brown: Each woman is different. Some women find that they no longer have cramps; others claim there is no change. If you are not breastfeeding, you generally will start menstruating six to eight weeks postpartum. If you are breastfeeding, you may not menstruate until you wean the baby. Other women get their period back but continue to breastfeed. Your first period after childbirth is often much heaver and lasts longer than usual. <br>  Breastfeeding is not a form of contraception. It is the sensation of the baby sucking that sends a message to the brain to suppress the hormone that stimulates ovulation. This means that the baby needs to be almost continuously sucking for the brain to block ovulation. In Western societies, most women do not go around with the baby at their breast all the time. <br>  In some cases if the baby sucks its thumb or a pacifier, this may be enough to diminish the intensity of his sucking. <br>  <br>   <br>  Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)<br>  Introduction<br>  Even if you're not familiar with the term "dysmenorrhea," if you're a woman, chances are you've experienced it at some time in your life. Dysmenorrhea is simply the medical term for menstrual cramps, that dull or throbbing pain in the lower abdomen many women experience just before and during their menstrual periods. For some women, the discomfort is merely annoying. For others, it can be severe enough to interfere with everyday activities for a few days every month.<br>  Dysmenorrhea can be primary or secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea involves no physical abnormality and usually begins within three years after you begin menstruating. Secondary dysmenorrhea involves an underlying physical cause, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids.<br>  If you have primary dysmenorrhea, there are some measures you can take to ease the discomfort. You can also take comfort in knowing that cramps tend to decrease in intensity as you get older and often disappear after pregnancy. For secondary dysmenorrhea, managing your cramps involves treating the underlying cause.<br>  Signs and symptoms<br>  Most women experience menstrual cramps at some time in their lives. Cramps become problematic when they're severe enough to keep you from going about your day-to-day routine.<br>  If you have primary dysmenorrhea, cramps most likely began within three years after you started menstruating. They may persist through your 20s or until you deliver a child and, for unknown reasons, they're likely to decrease in intensity or go away entirely. With secondary dysmenorrhea, cramps may start or return later in life, but can begin anytime after you begin menstruating.<br>  Signs and symptoms of dysmenorrhea, whether primary or secondary, may include:<br>  ·Dull or throbbing pain in your lower abdomen<br>  ·Pain that radiates to your lower back and thighs<br>  Less common signs and symptoms include:<br>  ·Nausea and vomiting<br>  ·Loose stools<br>  ·Sweating<br>  ·Dizziness<br>  Causes<br>   <br>  CLICK TO ENLARGE<br>   Normal ovulation <br>   <br>  To create a nourishing environment for a fertilized egg, the female sex hormone estrogen causes your uterine lining (endometrium) to thicken every month. Soon after, a follicle — a tiny sac in your ovary that contains a single egg (ovum) — ruptures and releases its egg (ovulation). If the egg becomes fertilized by contact with a sperm on its way to your uterus, the egg implants in the lining of the uterus. However, most often the unfertilized egg passes through your uterus and out of your body. Shortly thereafter, your uterus releases the lining, and your menstrual flow begins.<br>  To help expel its lining, your uterus contracts. Prostaglandins, hormone-like substances involved in pain and inflammation, trigger the uterine muscle contractions. No one knows for sure, but many experts believe that prostaglandins cause menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea).<br>  A number of conditions can cause secondary dysmenorrhea. They include:<br>  ·Endometriosis. In this painful condition, the type of tissue that lines your uterus becomes implanted outside your uterus, most commonly on your fallopian tubes, ovaries or the tissue lining your pelvis.<br>  ·Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This infection of the female reproductive organs is usually caused by sexually transmitted bacteria.<br>  ·Use of an intrauterine device (IUD). These small, plastic, T-shaped birth control devices are inserted into your uterus. They may cause increased cramping, particularly during the first few months after insertion.<br>  ·Uterine fibroids and uterine polyps. These noncancerous tumors and growths protrude from the lining of your uterus.<br>  Risk factors<br>  You're more likely to have severe menstrual cramps if you have one or both of the following:<br>  ·Early onset of puberty (age 11 or younger)<br>  ·A family history of painful periods<br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  If you've started menstruating within the past few years and are experiencing cramps, chances are your menstrual pain is primary dysmenorrhea and not a cause for concern. However, if cramping disrupts your life for several days a month or if you're older and just started experiencing severe menstrual cramps, see your doctor. If you have secondary dysmenorrhea, pinpointing the underlying cause is the first step to successful treatment.<br>  Screening and diagnosis<br>  Your doctor will review your medical history and perform a physical examination, including a pelvic exam. During the pelvic exam, your doctor will check for any abnormalities in your reproductive organs and look for indications of infection.<br>  To rule out other causes of your symptoms or to identify the cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, your doctor may request diagnostic tests, such as:<br>  ·Imaging tests. Noninvasive tests that enable your doctor to look for abnormalities inside your pelvic cavity include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br>  ·Laparoscopy. This surgical procedure involves your doctor viewing your pelvic cavity by making tiny incisions in your abdomen and inserting a fiber-optic tube with a small camera lens.<br>  ·Hysteroscopy. In this procedure, your doctor inserts an instrument through your vagina and your cervical canal to examine your cervical canal and the inside of your uterus.<br>  Complications<br>  The complications of secondary dysmenorrhea depend on the underlying cause. For instance, pelvic inflammatory disease can scar your fallopian tubes and compromise reproductive health. The scarring can lead to an ectopic pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tube rather than traveling through the tube to implant in your uterus, or it implants somewhere else outside your uterus. Endometriosis, another possible cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, can lead to impaired fertility.<br>  Treatment<br>  For secondary dysmenorrhea, you'll need treatment for the underlying cause. Depending on the cause, treatment could include antibiotics to treat infection or surgery to remove fibroids or polyps.<br>  You may be able to reduce your discomfort from dysmenorrhea by using an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) or naproxen (Aleve). Self-care strategies also may help relieve discomfort. For severe cramping, your doctor might recommend low-dose oral contraceptives to prevent ovulation, which may reduce the production of prostaglandins and therefore the severity of your cramps.<br>  Self-care<br>  You can try a number of self-care strategies to reduce the discomfort of primary dysmenorrhea. Once the pain begins, soaking in a hot bath or using a heating pad on your abdomen may ease your cramps. You can also make some lifestyle changes to improve your overall health and possibly decrease the severity of your cramps. Try these tips:<br>  ·Exercise regularly. Exercise results in an increased release of endorphins, your body's natural painkillers.<br>  ·Get adequate rest. Your body may be less vulnerable to pain when you're well rested.<br>  Complementary and alternative medicine<br>  Some women find relief through massage, yoga or meditation, all stress-relieving activities that may help to lessen pain and aren't likely to harm you. Some women find acupuncture helpful for pain relief. The National Institutes of Health issued a consensus statement in 1998 stating that acupuncture may help relieve certain types of pain, including menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  We hear a lot about the menstrual "cycle," which can make it sound as though it happens like clockwork. And we say that a woman who gets her period every 4 weeks is "regular," as though there's usually something abnormal about women who don't. In fact, most women don't get their periods at exactly the same number of days after the last one.<br>  Let's take a look at what happens when a girl gets her first period (also known as menarche, pronounced: meh-nar-kee). For most girls, this happens between the ages of 9 and 16.<br>  Your menstrual cycle occurs in stages, which doctors often talk about in terms of 28 days. But 28 is just an average figure that doctors use. Women's cycle lengths vary - some have a 24-day cycle, some have a 34-day cycle. The only thing you can usually count on is that if you're not pregnant, nursing, or ill, you will get your period again.<br>  The first day a girl's period comes is Day 1 of her cycle. Around Day 5, her pituitary gland tells the ovaries to start preparing one of the eggs they contain for release. One egg will mature completely, and at the same time the lining of the uterus gets thicker. The lining becomes thick to prepare a nesting place for the fertilized egg in the event that the girl becomes pregnant.<br>  On or about Day 14, the egg breaks loose (this is called ovulation) and makes its way through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If the egg hasn't been fertilized by sperm, it will disintegrate. About 2 weeks later, the lining and egg leave a girl's body as her period and the whole thing starts all over again - that's why we use the word cycle.<br>  All this sounds very neat and orderly, but your body may not follow this schedule exactly. It's not unusual, especially in the first 2 years after menarche, to skip periods or to have an irregular menstrual cycle. Illness, rapid weight change, or stress can also make things more unpredictable because the part of the brain that regulates periods is influenced by stuff like this.<br>  Some girls always have irregular periods; others get theirs every 28 days like clockwork. Many are regular most of the time, but occasionally skip a period or get an extra period during times of pressure or stress. In fact, you may notice that when you go on a trip or have a major change in your schedule your period is late.<br>  The length of your periods may also vary - sometimes your period may last 2 days, sometimes 10. That's because the level of hormones your body manufactures can be different from one cycle to the next and this affects the amount and length of bleeding.<br>  So how can you tell when you're about to get your period? If you're not regular, you'll want to pay attention to the clues your body may give you. These include:<br>  ·back cramps or stiffness<br>  ·heavier breasts or breast soreness (this will happen after ovulation and before you get your period)<br>  ·headaches<br>  ·acne breakouts<br>  ·disturbed sleep patterns<br>  ·mood swings<br>  If you're not taking birth control pills, you're not pregnant, and you're not having other symptoms such as stomach pain, then it's very likely that your irregular periods are part of the normal changes that can happen when you're a teen. At some point as you grow, your cycle will probably settle into a recognizable pattern. This should happen by 3 years after your first period.<br>  Some teens may develop irregular periods - or stop having periods altogether - as a result of a hormone imbalance. Disorders of the thyroid gland can cause menstrual irregularities if the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood become too low or too high. Some women have irregular periods because their bodies produce too much androgen, which is a hormone that causes increased muscle mass, facial hair, and deepening of the voice in males and the development of pubic hair and increased height in girls. High amounts of androgen can also cause hair growth on the face, chin, chest, and abdomen, and is sometimes associated with excessive weight gain.<br>  If a girl has one of these problems, or if her periods are irregular for 3 years or more (or for other reasons), the doctor may prescribe hormone pills or other medications that will help her to have regular periods.<br>  In the meantime, if your periods are irregular, try keeping some pads or tampons in your backpack, just so you'll have them handy in case your period comes when you're not expecting it.<br>  It's important to see a doctor if you're sexually active and have missed a period - this could be a sign that you're pregnant. You should also see your doctor if you start having periods that last longer than 7 to 10 days or periods that are accompanied by severe cramping or abdominal pain.<br>  <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/girls/irregular_periods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...</a><br>  <br>  Irregular periods<br>  by Marcelle Pick, OB/GYN NP<br>  To begin with, let me reassure you that most irregular periods are benign. Missed periods, too frequent periods, spotting, or bouts of heavy clotting and bleeding are usually caused by an underlying hormonal imbalance that is easily treated.<br>  Most of us have missed a period at one point or another — some with anticipation of a pregnancy, others because of anxiety or tension. At the clinic, we see women who menstruate like clockwork, while others report never having had a regular cycle. One thing is a given, however: shifts in hormonal balance will alter whatever pattern a woman has experienced in the past. Such shifts are especially common in perimenopause.<br>  What is an irregular period?<br>  At the clinic we answer questions all the time about irregular periods. A textbook period happens every 24-29 days, but in truth what is “regular” covers a wide range. Cycles between 23–35 days are very common. A woman may get her period only one to four times a year. Or she might have periods that occur two to three times in a month and involve spotting or extremely heavy flow. Alternatively, she may have heavy episodes of bleeding every two to three months. Irregular periods are simply what is irregular for you.<br>  For the most part, we don’t worry at the clinic about a missed period or two over the course of a year. More variation than that may indicate to us the beginning of perimenopause or a disruption of the natural chain of hormonal events that controls menstruation. A wide variety of factors can be responsible for irregular periods, among them:<br>  ·Significant weight gain or loss<br>  ·Over-exercise<br>  ·Poor nutrition (or a diet too high in carbohydrates)<br>  ·Smoking<br>  ·Drug use<br>  ·Caffeine<br>  ·Excessive alcohol use (interfering with how the liver metabolizes estrogen and progesterone) <br>  ·Eating disorders<br>  ·Increased stress<br>  ·Polycystic ovarian syndrome/estrogen dominance<br>  ·Uterine abnormalities (fibroids/cysts/polyps/endometriosis)<br>  ·Hormonal imbalance related to perimenopause<br>  ·Medications<br>  ·Chemotherapy<br>  ·Recent childbirth, miscarriage, or D&C <br>  ·Breastfeeding <br>  As you can see, there are many different ways a woman can be irregular for as many different reasons, and it can be very confusing when it happens.<br>  Why does being stressed out cause irregular periods?<br>  When we are under stress, regardless of the source (danger, personal relationships, work, environment) our adrenal glands are designed to secrete the hormone cortisol (see our articles on adrenal fatigue). Cortisol has a direct impact on the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone, and DHEA. Eating disorders, dieting, drug use, and reliance on stimulants like caffeine and alcohol are also interpreted by the body as kinds of stress. Poor nutrition seems to physically change the proteins in the brain so they can no longer send the proper signals for normal ovulation.<br>  Am I in menopause if I have irregular periods?<br>  No — irregular periods are generally an indication of hormonal imbalance, not necessarily related to menopause. Strictly speaking, women aren’t considered menopausal until they have gone for one year without a menstrual period.<br>  If you have not had a menstrual period for a full year and then experience bleeding, this is different from irregular periods. We explain this in more detail in our article on post-menopausal bleeding.<br>  By the way, it is a myth that a woman goes into menopause because her body runs out of eggs. If this were true, then women who experienced menarche (the first period in a woman’s life) earlier would enter menopause earlier. In fact, the opposite is true — early menarche is associated with late menopause. In the same vein, women who had more pregnancies and thereby fewer periods, would have menopause later, and that doesn’t happen, either. If you are experiencing increasing irregularity, you may be suffering from hormonal imbalance or entering perimenopause, and should be evaluated by a healthcare practitioner.<br>  Am I in perimenopause if I have irregular periods?<br>  Not necessarily, but irregular periods are one of the most common signals of perimenopause. That’s why it’s best to check in with a healthcare practitioner.<br>  Women entering perimenopause often have irregular periods due to an imbalance of progesterone that upsets their cycle. Because progesterone regulates the amount and length of bleeding, periods can last longer and be accompanied by very heavy bleeding (also called menorrhagia or hypermenorrhagia). However, shorter or spottier periods can also indicate perimenopause. Click here to learn more about irregular periods in perimenopause.<br>  What does it mean if I miss a period or two?<br>  The most common type of irregular period we see at the clinic is anovulation, or a cycle in which a woman does not ovulate (i.e., does not release an egg). This is frequently the cause of a missed period (an anovulatory cycle) and is considered normal if it occurs only once or twice a year. Clotting is also considered normal if it is cyclic.<br>  Sporadic episodes of poor diet, high stress, emotional trauma, illness, or strenuous physical exercise are the usual suspects behind occasional anovulatory cycles. Sometimes something as simple as a family holiday or a week with the in-laws will play havoc with a menstrual cycle. Monthly periods are quite susceptible to dips and spikes in our emotions and our health. For the most part, once our lives return to normal, so do our periods.<br>  On the other hand, a woman will sometimes skip her period for a few months and then start a heavy period that lasts for days or even weeks. This can be a sign that a woman is entering perimenopause (see above).<br>  More and more we are seeing patients of all ages who come in to the clinic with irregular periods due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), an easily recognizable and treatable condition that frequently occurs with insulin resistance. With PCOS, the ovaries produce a quantity of follicles that generate high levels of estrogen but never release an egg. The excessive estrogen stimulates the uterine lining to thicken to a point where it must slough off. Women with this condition are not having what are considered “real” menstrual periods because they do not regularly ovulate. For more information, we recommend you start with our article on insulin resistance, where you will find other helpful links about this topic.<br>  What if I’m just spotting or not getting a period at all?<br>  We’ve all heard stories from friends who’ve suddenly lost a lot of weight or begun a strenuous exercise regimen, then stopped getting their period. Anorexic women or those who exercise two to three hours a day can find their menstrual cycles diminish or stop due to a decrease in body fat. These women have low estrogen and are not ovulating. This is called stress-type hypothalamic amenorrhea, and it occurs when poor nutrition and stress alter the brain’s chemistry and hormone pathways. The brain can’t trigger the right hormones for follicle development, which make the necessary estrogens. Women with this irregularity tend to be at higher risk for bone loss (osteoporosis) and other degenerative conditions and should be evaluated. Click here for more information about amenorrhea.<br>  Why does my period come twice a month?<br>  In addition to missed periods, we also see women who get more than one period in the span of a month. The causes for this are relatively unknown, but stress and lifestyle seem once again to play a major role. Ingesting medication or other substances that disrupt the luteal phase may be a factor, as well.<br>  I bleed really heavily when I get my period. What does this mean?<br>  Low progesterone, PCOS, or another form of hormonal imbalance may be the culprit. If a woman has two or more successive months of heavy bleeding, a check-up is called for. <br>  Any kind of heavy bleeding can contribute to anemia. When a patient has anemia, we try to stem the heavy menstrual flow and prescribe an iron supplement. Depending on the severity of the situation we may choose from a range of progesterone therapy options along with diet and exercise modifications to help rebalance the hormonal equation. Bioidentical over-the counter, compounded, or prescription formulations are often adequate. A more serious scenario may call for a synthetic progestin such as Aygestin or Provera to bring the bleeding back under control. We will also often suggest acupuncture for relief.

It’s a good idea to do the following:<br>  ·Have a complete physical, including evaluations of thyroid function and blood pressure. Also, a complete blood count (CBC) test is quite important for the diagnosis of anemia.<br>  <br>  ·A pelvic exam is critical to rule out any uterine abnormality, a cervical polyp or fibroid, or a uterine infection. These are less common causes but should be considered. Often an ultrasound will be required to evaluate the uterus, the ovaries and the fallopian tubes. Ultrasound of the uterus is useful and painless — you may already be familiar with this technique from pregnancy. If infection is a concern, antibiotics will be prescribed.<br>  <br>  ·If you are trying to become pregnant, consult with a fertility specialist or a qualified ob/gyn practitioner for further testing.<br>  What is the treatment for irregular periods?<br>  Most of the time, simply decreasing our stress, improving nutrition and adding adequate nutritional supplements can provide a natural way to restore regular menstrual cycles. These steps alone give the body a much needed boost and will support the natural hormonal balance and monthly cycles we are meant to enjoy… and appreciate!<br>  If the issue stems from an anovulatory or perimenopausal condition, a doctor may prescribe birth control pills or progesterone to normalize the cycle. This is often successful. For most patients, we’ve seen a big improvement when positive steps are made to change their lifestyle, including:<br>  ·healthy dietary modifications<br>  <br>  ·supplementing nutritional gaps with a good multivitamin, calcium, magnesium, and fish oil<br>  <br>  ·decreasing intake of refined carbohydrates<br>  <br>  ·moderating your exercise (this may require increasing or decreasing your current level of exercise)<br>  <br>  ·stress relief through exercise or other relaxation techniques<br>  <br>  ·reprioritizing one’s commitments<br>  <br>  For the majority of women who make these changes, a normal menstrual cycle returns without a hitch. In short, we think that most irregular periods are usually nothing to worry about and can be successfully addressed with straightforward, practical measures available to every woman.<br>  <a href="http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation/irregularperiods.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation...</a><br>  Missed or Irregular Periods <br>  <br>  Topic Overview <br>  <br>  <br>  Most women have between 11 and 13 menstrual periods each year. You may be different: You may have more or fewer. Missed or irregular periods must be looked at in terms of what is normal for you.<br>  Periods are often irregular during the first few years after menstruation starts. It may take several years for the hormones that control menstruation to reach a balance.<br>  Menstrual periods also may be very irregular at the other end of the menstrual years. Many women realize that they are approaching perimenopause and menopause when their otherwise regular periods become irregular. Menopause occurs when it has been 12 months since you have had a menstrual period.<br>  Pregnancy is the most common cause of a missed period. If you might be pregnant, treat yourself as though you are pregnant until you know for sure. Use a home pregnancy test as the first step to finding out whether you are pregnant.<br>  If you are not pregnant, other causes of missed or irregular periods include:<br>  ·Excessive weight loss or gain. Although low body weight is a common cause of missed or irregular periods, obesity also can cause menstrual problems. <br>  ·Eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia. For more information, see the topic Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa.<br>  ·Increased exercise. Missed periods are common in endurance athletes.<br>  ·Extreme emotional stress.<br>  ·Travel.<br>  ·Medications, such as hormonal birth control methods, which may cause lighter, less frequent, more frequent, or skipped periods.<br>  ·Hormonal abnormalities, which cause fluctuating levels of the hormones needed to support menstruation.<br>  ·Illegal drug use.<br>  ·Problems with the pelvic organs , such as imperforate hymen, polycystic ovary syndrome, or Asherman's syndrome.<br>  ·Breast-feeding. Many women do not resume regular periods until they have completed breast-feeding.<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/hw96700.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_condition...</a><br>    <br>  Menstruation and the Menstrual Cycle<br>   [Printer-friendly version -- PDF file, 192 Kb]<br>  What is menstruation? <br>  What is the menstrual cycle? <br>  What happens during the menstrual cycle?<br>  What is a typical menstrual period like? <br>  What kinds of problems do women have with their periods? <br>  At what age does a girl get her first period? <br>  How long does a woman have periods? <br>  When should I see a health care provider about my period? <br>  How often should I change my pad/tampon? <br>  What is menstruation? <br>  Menstruation is a woman's monthly bleeding. It is also called menses, menstrual period, or period. When a woman has her period, she is menstruating. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus (womb). It flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix, and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days. <br>  What is the menstrual cycle? <br>  Menstruation is part of the menstrual cycle, which helps a woman's body prepare for the possibility of pregnancy each month. A cycle starts on the first day of a period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. However, a cycle can range anywhere from 23 days to 35 days. <br>  The parts of the body involved in the menstrual cycle include the brain, pituitary gland, uterus and cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vagina. Body chemicals called hormones rise and fall during the month and make the menstrual cycle happen. The ovaries make two important female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Other hormones involved in the menstrual cycle include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), made by the pituitary gland. <br>  What happens during the menstrual cycle? <br>  In the first half of the menstrual cycle, levels of estrogen rise and make the lining of the uterus grow and thicken. In response to follicle-stimulating hormone, an egg (ovum) in one of the ovaries starts to mature. At about day 14 of a typical 28-day cycle, in response to a surge of luteinizing hormone, the egg leaves the ovary. This is called ovulation. <br>  In the second half of the menstrual cycle, the egg begins to travel through the fallopian tube to the uterus. Progesterone levels rise and help prepare the uterine lining for pregnancy. If the egg becomes fertilized by a sperm cell and attaches itself to the uterine wall, the woman becomes pregnant. If the egg is not fertilized, it either dissolves or is absorbed into the body. If pregnancy does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels drop, and the thickened lining of the uterus is shed during the menstrual period. <br>  In the illustration below, an egg has left an ovary after ovulation and is on its way through a fallopian tube to the uterus. <br>   <br>  Image Source: U.S. Food and Drug Administration <br>  What is a typical menstrual period like? <br>  During the menstrual period, the thickened uterine lining and extra blood are shed through the vaginal canal. A woman's period may not be the same every month, and it may not be the same as other women's periods. Periods can be light, moderate, or heavy, and the length of the period also varies. While most menstrual periods last from three to five days, anywhere from two to seven days is considered normal. For the first few years after menstruation begins, periods may be very irregular. They may also become irregular in women approaching menopause. Sometimes birth control pills are prescribed to help with irregular periods or other problems with the menstrual cycle. <br>  Sanitary pads or tampons, which are made of cotton or another absorbent material, are worn to absorb the blood flow. Sanitary pads are placed inside the panties; tampons are inserted into the vagina. <br>  What kinds of problems do women have with their periods? <br>  Women can have various kinds of problems with their periods, including pain, heavy bleeding, and skipped periods. <br>  ·Amenorrhea - the lack of a menstrual period. This term is used to describe the absence of a period in young women who haven't started menstruating by age 16, or the absence of a period in women who used to have a regular period. Causes of amenorrhea include pregnancy, breastfeeding, and extreme weight loss caused by serious illness, eating disorders, excessive exercising, or stress. Hormonal problems (involving the pituitary, thyroid, ovary, or adrenal glands) or problems with the reproductive organs may be involved. <br>  ·Dysmenorrhea - painful periods, including severe menstrual cramps. In younger women, there is often no known disease or condition associated with the pain. A hormone called prostaglandin is responsible for the symptoms. Some pain medicines available over the counter, such as ibuprofen, can help with these symptoms. Sometimes a disease or condition, such as uterine fibroids or endometriosis, causes the pain. Treatment depends on what is causing the problem and how severe it is. <br>  ·Abnormal uterine bleeding-vaginal bleeding that is different from normal menstrual periods. It includes very heavy bleeding or unusually long periods (also called menorrhagia), periods too close together, and bleeding between periods. In adolescents and women approaching menopause, hormone imbalance problems often cause menorrhagia along with irregular cycles. Sometimes this is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Other causes of abnormal bleeding include uterine fibroids and polyps. Treatment for abnormal bleeding depends on the cause. <br>  At what age does a girl get her first period? <br>  Menarche is another name for the beginning of menstruation. In the United States, the average age a girl starts menstruating is 12. However, this does not mean that all girls start at the same age. A girl can begin menstruating anytime between the ages of 8 and 16. Menstruation will not occur until all parts of a girl's reproductive system have matured and are working together. <br>  How long does a woman have periods? <br>  Women usually continue having periods until menopause. Menopause occurs around the age of 51, on average. Menopause means that a woman is no longer ovulating (producing eggs) and therefore can no longer become pregnant. Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and may take several years to occur. Some women have early menopause because of surgery or other treatment, illness, or other reasons. <br>  When should I see a health care provider about my period? <br>  You should consult your health care provider for the following: <br>  ·If you have not started menstruating by the age of 16. <br>  ·If your period has suddenly stopped. <br>  ·If you are bleeding for more days than usual. <br>  ·If you are bleeding excessively. <br>  ·If you suddenly feel sick after using tampons. <br>  ·If you bleed between periods (more than just a few drops). <br>  ·If you have severe pain during your period. <br>  How often should I change my pad/tampon? <br>  Sanitary napkins (pads) should be changed as often as necessary, before the pad is soaked with menstrual flow. Each woman decides for herself what is comfortable. Tampons should be changed often (at least every 4-8 hours). Make sure that you use the lowest absorbency of tampon needed for your flow. For example, do not use super absorbency on the lightest day of your period. This can put you at risk for toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a rare but potentially deadly disease. Women under 30, especially teenagers, are at a higher risk for TSS. Using any kind of tampon - cotton or rayon of any absorbency - puts a woman at greater risk for TSS than using menstrual pads. The risk of TSS can be lessened or avoided by not using tampons, or by alternating between tampons and pads during your period. <br>  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends the following tips to help avoid tampon problems: <br>  ·Follow package directions for insertion. <br>  ·Choose the lowest absorbency for your flow. <br>  ·Change your tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. <br>  ·Consider alternating pads with tampons. <br>  ·Know the warning signs of toxic shock syndrome (see below). <br>  ·Don't use tampons between periods. <br>  If you experience any of the following symptoms while you are menstruating and using tampons, you should contact your health care provider immediately: <br>  ·High fever that appears suddenly <br>  ·Muscle aches <br>  ·Diarrhea <br>  ·Dizziness and/or fainting <br>  ·Sunburn-like rash <br>  ·Sore throat <br>  ·Bloodshot eyes <br>  For more information… <br>  To learn more about menstruation, contact the National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) at 1-800-994-9662 or the following organizations: <br>  Food and Drug Administration <br>  Phone Number(s): (888) 463-6332 <br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/</a> <br>  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Resource Center <br>  Phone Number(s): (800) 762-2264 x 192 (for publications requests only) <br>  Internet Address: www.acog.org <br>  Nemours Foundation <br>  Phone Number(s): (302) 651-4046 <br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.nemours.org/internet" rel="nofollow">http://www.nemours.org/internet</a> <br>  All material contained in the FAQs is free of copyright restrictions, and may be copied, reproduced, or duplicated without permission of the Office on Women's Health in the Department of Health and Human Services; citation of the source is appreciated. <br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/faq/menstru.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Premenstrual Syndrome<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/pms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/faq/pms.htm</a><br>  <br>  What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?<br>  What are the symptoms of PMS?<br>  How common is PMS?<br>  What treatment is available for PMS?<br>  What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)?<br>  <br>  See also…<br>  <br>      * Menstruation and the Menstrual Cycle<br>  <br>  What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?<br>  <br>  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS symptoms occur in the week or two weeks before your period (menstruation or monthly bleeding). The symptoms usually go away after your period starts. PMS may interfere with your normal activities at home, school, or work. Menopause, when monthly periods stop, brings an end to PMS.<br>  <br>  The causes of PMS are not yet clear. Some women may be more sensitive than others to changing hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Stress does not seem to cause PMS, but may make it worse. PMS can affect menstruating women of any age.<br>  <br>  PMS often includes both physical and emotional symptoms. Diagnosis of PMS is usually based on your symptoms, when they occur, and how much they affect your life.<br>  What are the symptoms of PMS?<br>  <br>  PMS often includes both physical and emotional symptoms. Common symptoms are:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        breast swelling and tenderness<br>      *<br>  <br>        fatigue and trouble sleeping<br>      *<br>  <br>        upset stomach, bloating, constipation or diarrhea<br>      *<br>  <br>        headache<br>      *<br>  <br>        appetite changes or food cravings<br>      *<br>  <br>        joint or muscle pain<br>      *<br>  <br>        tension, irritability, mood swings, or crying spells<br>      *<br>  <br>        anxiety or depression<br>      *<br>  <br>        trouble concentrating or remembering.<br>  <br>  Symptoms vary from one woman to another. If you think you have PMS, try keeping track of your symptoms for several menstrual cycles. You can use a calendar to note which symptoms you are having on which days of your cycle, and how bad the symptoms are. If you seek medical care for your PMS, having this kind of record is helpful.<br>  How common is PMS?<br>  <br>  Estimates of the percentage of women affected by PMS vary widely. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, up to 40 percent of menstruating women report some symptoms of PMS. Most of these women have symptoms that are fairly mild and do not need treatment. Some women (perhaps five to ten percent of menstruating women) have a more severe form of PMS.<br>  What treatment is available for PMS?<br>  <br>  Many treatments have been tried for easing the symptoms of PMS. However, no treatment has been found that works for everyone. A combination of lifestyle changes and other treatment may be needed. If your PMS is not so bad that you need medical help, a healthier lifestyle may help you feel better and cope with symptoms.<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Adopt a healthier way of life. Exercise regularly, get enough sleep, choose healthy foods, don't smoke, and find ways to manage stress in your life.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Try avoiding excess salt, sugary foods, caffeine, and alcohol, especially when you are having PMS symptoms.<br>      *<br>  <br>        Be sure that you are getting enough vitamins and minerals. Take a multivitamin every day that includes 400 micrograms of folic acid. A calcium supplement with vitamin D can help keep bones strong and may help with PMS symptoms.<br>      *<br>  <br>        In more severe cases, drugs such as diuretics, ibuprofen, birth control pills, or antidepressants may be used.<br>  <br>  Although PMS does not seem to be related to abnormal hormone levels, some women respond to hormonal treatment. For example, one approach has been to use drugs such as birth control pills to stop ovulation from occurring. There is evidence that a brain chemical, serotonin, plays a role in severe forms of PMS. Antidepressants that alter serotonin in the body have been shown to help many women with severe PMS.<br>  What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)?<br>  <br>  PMDD is a severe, disabling form of PMS. In PMDD, the main symptoms are mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, tension, and persistent anger or irritability. These severe symptoms lead to problems with relationships and carrying out normal activities. Women with PMDD usually also have physical symptoms, such as headache, joint and muscle pain, lack of energy, bloating and breast tenderness. According to the American Psychiatric Association, a woman must have at least five of the typical symptoms to be diagnosed with PMDD. The symptoms must occur during the two weeks before her period and go away when bleeding begins.<br>  <br>  Research has shown that antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help many women with PMDD. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two such medications to date for treatment of PMDD - sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Sarafem).<br>  For More Information…<br>  <br>  To learn more about premenstrual syndrome, contact the National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC) at 1-800-994-9662 or the following organizations:<br>  <br>  National Institute of Mental Health<br>  Phone Number(s): (301) 443-4513<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/</a><br>  <br>  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Resource Center<br>  Phone Number(s): (202) 863-2518<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.acog.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acog.org/</a><br>  <br>  American Psychiatric Association<br>  Phone Number(s): (202) 682-6000<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.psych.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.psych.org/</a><br>  <br>  The Hormone Foundation<br>  Phone Number(s): (800) 467-6663<br>  Internet Address: <a href="http://www.hormone.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hormone.org/</a><br>  <br>  All material contained in the FAQs is free of copyright restrictions, and may be copied, reproduced, or duplicated without permission of the Office on Women's Health in the Department of Health and Human Services; citation of the sources is appreciated.

Il coagule peu après son émission et se liquéfie en 10 à 30 minutes.<br>  Le liquide séminal est une combinaison de plusieurs fluides. Lors de l’éjaculation, le sperme contient des spermatozo?des fabriqués par les deux testicules. Mais il contient aussi deux autres substances : <br>  -du liquide séminal provenant des vésicules séminales et les sécrétions des glandes de Cowper., glandes sexuelles internes.<br>  -du liquide prostatique qui lui vient de la prostate, autre glande qui entoure l’urètre juste sous la vessie.<br>  <br>  Certains différencient le sperme (composante spermatozo?de fertilisante), du liquide séminal (la majeure partie des liquides éjaculés). Cette distinction peut expliquer la présence d’une infertilité masculine en dépit d’un grand volume d'éjaculat.<br>  On distingue quatre fractions dans l'éjaculat : <br>  ?la fraction pré-éjaculatoire;<br>  ?la fraction préliminaire; <br>  ?la fraction principale; <br>  ?la fraction terminale.<br>  <br>  La fraction pré-éjaculatoire survient au moment de la phase d'excitation sexuelle. Les sécrétions proviennent des glandes de Cowper et de Littre qui sembleraient jouer un r?le de lubrification pour l'écoulement du sperme.<br>  <br>  La fraction préliminaire provient des glandes prostatiques et contient des enzymes qui permettront la liquéfaction de l’éjaculat.<br>  <br>  La fraction principale est constituée par le mélange des sécrétions prostatiques et des vésicules séminales. Ce mélange est réalisé dans l'urètre intra-prostatique au cours de la phase d'émission. Les sécrétions des vésicules séminales et de la prostate sont plus particulièrement impliquées dans la formation du coagulum séminal, dans la modification de la mobilité des spermatozo?des et dans l'immunosuppression.<br>  <br>  La fraction terminale est constituée des sécrétions des vésicules séminales et est plus fluide. <br>  Le sperme a donc une constitution hétérogène qui se modifie au cours de l'éjaculation. L'expulsion s'effectue en 4 à 6 fractions et les deux tiers des spermatozo?des sont contenus dans la première moitié de l’éjaculat. Le sperme peut donc être recueilli de manière fractionnée pour son étude ou son utilisation dans le cadre d'inséminations intra-cervicales. <br>  <br>  Composition :<br>  Mis à part l'eau et les spermatozo?des, le sperme contient de nombreux sels minéraux comme le sodium, le magnésium, le phosphore, le calcium, le potassium et le zinc.<br>  Il contient également des sucres tels le fructose, qui est le principal "carburant" des spermatozo?des, et le sorbitol. Il est aussi riche en protéines.<br>  C'est un liquide légèrement basique (pH 7,2 à 7,6) notamment par la présence de spermine, spermidine et autres bases faibles. Ceci permet de neutraliser localement le pH acide (3,5 - 4) du vagin.<br>  On y trouve de plus des hormones et enzymes telles que la relaxine, des prostaglandines ou la fibrinolysine, qui favorisent le cheminement des spermatozo?des dans les organes génitaux de la femme, et des vitamines, vitamine C et vitamine B12.<br>  La valeur calorique d’une éjaculation moyenne varie entre 5 et 30 calories (pour un volume moyen éjaculé de 2 à 5 ml).<br>  <br>  En espérant avoir répondu à ta question…<br>  <br>  Amicalement..|`|e97bc2be0fea27899096f3ee329aa755aa	beaucoup de protéines!!!|`|f1bff29a4ee84b82aa97b766d66acca8aa	Anis + gla?ons.

It is a complete myth that alcohol prevents penicillin antibiotics from working. <br>  <br>  The only antibiotics that you must avoid with alcohol are the Metronidazole type antibiotics- they have a direct interaction with alcohol. You can check with your Pharmacist if you are unsure, but I am not wrong. Doesn't say you have to avoid alcohol in the drug advise leaflet that comes with the drug does it? Exactly. <br>  <br>  Ignore all the above answers who have said that alcohol will stop the antibiotic from working; if people do not have the correct knowledge they really should avoid answering medical questions.|`|cilYUWgtaa	looked at several sites regarding Amoxicillin,and there were no drug interactions with alcohol, but consider this page from the Mayo Clinic..<br>  <br>  The effects of combining antibiotics and alcohol can vary, depending on the specific antibiotic.<br>  <br>  Alcohol doesn't diminish the effectiveness of most antibiotics. However, antibiotics and alcohol can cause similar side effects, such as stomach upset, dizziness and drowsiness. When you combine antibiotics and alcohol, these side effects may increase.<br>  <br>  A few antibiotics — such as metronidazole (Flagyl), tinidazole (Tindamax) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) — should not be mixed with alcohol because this may result in a more severe reaction. Drinking any amount of alcohol with these medications can result in side effects such as flushing, headache, nausea and vomiting, rapid heart rate, and shortness of breath. Keep in mind that some cold medicines and mouthwashes also contain alcohol. So check the label and avoid such products while taking these antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Rarely, alcohol can reduce the effectiveness of certain antibiotics — such as doxycycline (Vibramycin, Doryx) — which means a higher dose may be required to achieve the same treatment benefit.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that alcohol can reduce your energy and delay how quickly you recover from illness. So, it may be best to avoid alcohol until you have finished your antibiotics and are feeling better.|`|b3701715d7f2027b9badd9cfdd2154fcaa	No! that's the short answer!  It really isn't good for you which is why it is recommended you avoid alcohol when taking them.  My personal example is when my mum took them and went out and had a few drinks.  she came home and actually wanted to die she felt so rough.  she was violently ill and i had to put her to bed (I was 18 at the time) and that image has stuck with both of us!  they definitely don't mix!|`|MNja3iwMaa	Most of them it doesnt matter, but there are a couple of the really strong ones that you should avoid alcohol at all costs|`|cTvP6j7Haa	You can, but it is not recommended.  When you pass out, you had enough ~ one or the other or both.<br>  Peace.|`|HeBFxZVCaa	not unless you wanna end up in hospital and get your stomach pumped it should say on the bottle do not mix with alcohol if you stop taking them 24 hour before you should be fine but then you risk you infection or whatever your taking the antibiotics for getting worse.|`|AA11395970	To answer the question, yes, you can.<br>  <br>  To address the issue...no, you should not.  Alcohol and meds do not mix.<br>  <br>  Some people get so high on that combination, they forget they've taken their meds and take them a second and even a third time and come close to dying.

The effects of certain antibiotics will be reduced when taken in combination with alcohol and as a rule, one should avoid combining alcohol with any medication. <br>  <br>  The extent to which each dose of any drug reaches its site of action may be termed its availability. Alcohol can influence the effectiveness of a drug by altering its availability. A single drink of alcohol or several drinks over some hours may prevent a drug's metabolism by competing with the drug for the same processing sites within the liver. This type of interaction prolongs the drug's availability, and may increase the risk of side effects from the drug. On the other hand, chronic alcohol abuse may cause an increase in the liver's ability to process the drug, thus decreasing availability and reducing its effects. This effect may persist for several weeks after stopping drinking. To complicate matters further, a drug may affect the way in which alcohol is broken down, increasing the risk of becoming intoxicated.|`|mkyFiylSaa	no.doctors recommend that you dont drink while taking antibiotics as alcohol weakens the effect of these tablets as alcohol is a dieretic and it will make you wee more often.only water im afraid till tablets are taken.remember to take the whole course.its only for seven days or so.its not going to kill you to go without a drink.watch others get drunk and you can guarantee that thats how you look when drunk.|`|SyuGWtq0aa	Acutally it is a myth that you can't drink while taking antibiotics.

Most patients tolerate the procedure with only topical anaesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anaesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed.<br>  <br>  The patient lies on his/her left side with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the endoscope. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the orpharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine the first and second parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.<br>  <br>  In its most basic use, the endoscope is used to inspect the internal anatomy of the digestive tract. Often inspection alone is sufficient, but biopsy is a very valuable adjunct to endoscopy. Small biopsies can be made with a pincer (biopsy forceps) which is passed through the scope and allows sampling of 1 to 3 mm pieces of tissue under direct vision. The intestinal mucosa heals quickly from such biopsies.<br>  <br>  Biopsy allows the pathologist to render an opinion on later histologic examination of the biopsy tissue with light microscopy and/or immunohistochemistry. Biopsied material can also be tested on urease to identify Helicobacter pylori.|`|EMbaak9waa	They put you to sleep for this procedure.

CNW6eAjoaa	Do some of the stretches in the first link below, and read about care of the intact penis in the following links.  When you retract your foreskin, you see the accumulated smegma which has collected.  If it does not come off easily, soak in a warm bath with your foreskin retracted, and give this deposit a chance to soften.  It will brush off easier.  It may take two or three sessions. Afterwards, a rinse in clean water during the daily shower is all it requires.  Avoid strong soaps in this area.<br>  Smegma is a collection of Langerin, semen, sweat, urine and skin cells.  Langerin is a powerful disease fighting compound secreted by your foreskin/glans combination.  It keeps microbes at bay.  Washing with harsh soaps removes the langerin, allowing odours and germs a chance to develop.  This blows the doors off the myth that circumcision is healthier.  If you cut the foreskin off, there is no Langerin production, and thus no disease protection.  You are fortunate to be intact.

fYeu6vE6aa	Your pneumonia is caused by an infection with bacteria. This is treated by antibiotics.<br>  <br>  However, there are MANY different kinds of bacteria that can cause pneumonia. Bacteria differ based on structure, and shape, and the toxins they produce, and how they function.<br>  <br>  Antibiotics come in many different types, and each antibiotic can only kill certain bacteria.<br>  <br>  You have to realize that the bacteria that causes a UTI is often very different from the bacteria causing a pneumonia. Therefore, the antibiotics used to treat the UTI (bactrim, also known as co-trimoxazole) will likely have no effect on the bacteria causing your pneumonia. <br>  <br>  Usually, with pneumonia, the first step is called "empirical treatment". Many pneumonias are caused by the same types of bacteria, so they will give you an antibiotic that works on many of those ocmmon types. In this case they gave you zithromax, which is pretty standard treatment.<br>  <br>  However, if the zithromax is not working, they they could do is take a sample from your sputum (if you are coughing up phlegm) and look at waht bacteria is in it. Sometimes they will not be able to find the bacteria. But often, they can and they can tell what antibiotic should kill the bacteria.<br>  <br>  If you start doing really badly (very weak, unable to walk, blood pressure dropping rapidly...getting to a an emergency state) they should keep you in the hospital and give you the antibiotics intravenously. But if it is not that bad, and you can still walk and move then they will give you more pills. <br>  <br>  Are there any pro-bono clinics in your area? Maybe you can go there to get your sputum tested and get different antibiotics. Family medicine clinics sometimes do get free sampels of drugs from pharmaceutical companies, so you can ask them for samples if you cannot afford them. If you have a family doctor, I'd consider this option over going to the ER.

YCXxP43Laa	I don't think the numbers are anything significant, but remember with sleep paralysis your mind wakes up before your body; your mind may have been trying to find something to do and so fired off random numbers.<br>  <br>  Sleep paralysis occurs when the body is paralysed during REM, the body does this so we don't injure ourselves by physically enacting a dream i.e. jumping out of a window etc. Sometimes the mind awakes before the body. It can be very scary but is common. The other side of this is sleepwalking, where your mind is asleep but the body isn't paralysed... this can be dangerous.<br>  <br>  I've have both, and as I don't remember the sleepwalking the paralysis is certainly more scary.  If it keeps occurring go to the doctors as they may refer you to a sleep disorder clinic. Good luck|`|nXPJ6d7eaa	Strangely enough, I just had a friend tell me that his book was about to be published and it's all about sleep paralysis, by someone who has experienced it. <br>  I'm sorry, I haven't read it yet, so I am not sure what it could mean, but I know the publisher is called anomalist books (www.anomalistbooks.com) so maybe they have more on the topic that might be helpful. <br>  Otherwise, my friends book is due for release in august/september.<br>  <br>  I hope you find the information you are after, it is an interesting subject.|`|WGos7RSMaa	I think they may just be random numbers.<br>  When I have sleep paralysis, I don't see them, only figures standing beside me. You should ask a psychiatrist about. <br>  <br>  They could mean something, but I'm not sure.  ):

S7rc6mp7aa	I paid only $60 for mine because of this great plan, but every situation is different. Some chips may need more work than others. www.healthsavings.ourperfectcard.com I signed up online over 5 years ago now and they have saved me thousands on all services. From extractions, crowns, fillings, xrays..etc. all services are included in this very affordable plan. Even my wisdom teeth removal. They even had my benefits active in 2 hours and was able to use them the very same day. Good luck and hope this helps.|`|qxWoiRHwaa	The treatment for a chipped tooth will vary dependent on how badly the tooth is damaged. If the chipped tooth is very minimally damaged<br>  it may be able to be filed smooth. Sounds like if its the whole corner, you will need a composite or porcelain veneers. Veneers are bonded directly to the tooth, giving it a smooth, natural appearance. If your are in pain or the tooth is badly damaged you may even need a crown.<br>  <br>  Based on what you say, you probably need a veneer. I would definitely go with a porcelain. The plastic one stain and don't last as long. You will pay on average around $700 but shop around. Here is a link to the average price of a porcelain veneer in Austin Texas as found on smarthealthbuyer.com. <br>  <br>  You can also look up the cost of the wisdom teeth. There are big differences in price according to the following, upper or lower wisdom teeth, impacted or not, general or local anesthetic. You may need additional treatments, e.g. bone grafting.

I found a food called Nature's Way (it has Lassie on the cover) to work best and I give her a bath in special oatmeal based shampoo once a month (it makes her smell like a cookie though).

2dacea660561bddc5e448a614dd7f5efaa	Sure, but mainly from retaining water.  Figure one lb. of body fat is equal to 3,500 calories.  So, if you eat like 5,000 calories in one day without exercising a lot, absolutely it can end up as a little extra body fat - but probably only less than half a lb. or so.<br>  <br>  Fatter look in just 1 day is probably just looking puffy from retaining water.  You'll do that if you eat lots of salty food, carbs, and other junk.  But if you have good habits most of the time, no need to worry about indulging once in a while.|`|Qz3IXj5kaa	It's alright to go indulge every so often - the media bombards us with two extremes of unattainable thinness versus "sinful" and "guilty" foods to the point where some have felt guilty just eating, which shouldn't be the point at all.<br>  <br>  That ONE day won't affect anything - so don't let it affect your emotions and your thoughts.

HAHA|`|35u9RVVFaa	condoms don't ever work 100%. but, aslong as the condom wasn't broken ans was left on the whole time, it should've been safe. in order to be almost 100% safe, your partner should be on birth control AND you should be wearing a condom. The woman in the situation possibly could get pregnant, but I highly doubt it. you should be safe.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Safe sex?  Intact condom, no diseases and no baby on the way.|`|zyaYJTRBaa	was the condom still on when you pulled it out?? no? good luck.|`|9PChI0Bxaa	The best way to have safe sex is to wear a condom every time. Make sure their latex, with no holes or tears. Follow the instructions inside the box for proper use. Keep them in a cool place. Make sure they fit properly. Get you and your partner checked for STD's often. But remember, nothing is 100 percent safe. But its the best way I know how.|`|a7MU00X9aa	Well in order to have safe sex, the girl should be on birth control and you should wear a condom.

XhexwM1faa	Some guys do, some guys don't. For me personally, I'm so aroused and turned on psychologically that I couldn't possibly lose my erection during sex. But all guys are different. Here's what you should do: tell your man to take Cialis, and then tell him softly "when the time is right, you better be ready."|`|zOIgzIy4aa	what kind of meds? certain kind can do it like blood pressure pills. also maybe he,s stressed out about something he,s not telling you or his mind is on something else.|`|fecUjSr1aa	like the saying goes, "different folks, different strokes"... some people are like your boyfriend .. amazing when he's rock hard and yes, he does need some stimulation, oh well, maybe a lot (if you enjoy it, i'm sure he would too). as for the matter of shooting off fast, its something you have to deal with. <br>  <br>  i'm the same way with my girlfriend. i'm the same way you describe your boyfriend too .. so what do we do?<br>  <br>  we count the score. yes, it can be fun too. so what i do (and i always do it first) is make my gf happy first and then in between breaths, i say, "one-zero." and then she starts working and she makes me reach cloud nine and then she says .. "one all"  and we have fun doing it.<br>  <br>  after all, aren't we suppose to have fun when we do this?<br>  <br>  sometimes "doing it together" like "plug and play" and try to reach the peak at the same time doesn't always work. so try the "scoring" system.<br>  <br>  hope this helps ...|`|XAkLPdhqaa	Don't give up on your boyfriend. It seem like anxiety.|`|2rjhsogBaa	His penis could be afraid of your vagina... Like he could have performace issues that lead to him not being ble to sustain an erection. This is more common in younger guys ie. 18-25. Erectile dysfunction is common butn includes many things such as ejaculating too quick etc. Sounds like you might have to have a talk with him and see if this is normal for him, like does he get performance anxiety or maybe he has something wrong and needs the see the DR. But NO usually a guy should be hard the whole time.|`|XgO9HUm9aa	Medication can cause this.<br>  <br>  His mind can cause this. If he isn't very experienced that could be causing it. Or if he really likes you that could cause it because he could be nervous. Also if he worries about whether or not he will be able to please you sexually that could make him nervous and cause this.<br>  <br>  With the inexperience of having his penis in a vagina he is probably used to masturbating which feels different. He needs to stop doing that sso much and have more sex with you.<br>  <br>  As for the only lasting for a few seconds that could be part of the other problems or another problem on it's own. Try to solve the not being able to keep an erection one first. Tell him to talk to his doctor about his meds and about what could be causing it other than inexperience in the vagina or other mental distress.
ahjqc9Ifaa	When you're doing weight resistance work, forget heart rate. That applies only to cardiovascular workouts like your walking program.<br>  <br>  The basic formula is (220 - [your age]) x [65% - 85%, depending on fitness level]<br>  <br>  So for you it would be (220 - 39) x (somewhere between 65% and 85%).<br>  <br>  If you're out of shape, then, 65% of 181 is right about 118, and you should at least reach and maintain that pulse rate as you walk. When you get fitter, you may have to break into a slow jog intermittently to stay at that heart rate.<br>  <br>  If you're kind of in shape, just carrying some extra weight, kick it up to 70% or 75%, which would be 127 or 136.<br>  <br>  Generally, only very fit people benefit from 80%, and only serious athletes need to reach 85%.<br>  <br>  Recalculate (and celebrate) when you lose ten pounds.

65e0585fc549613c60832e94407e704aaa	No, you are not fat. In fact, you weigh less than I do and I'm the same height. Anorexia differs by person. Most anorexics do eat but only small amounts. Some anorexics eat more than others. Anorexia is a psychological disorder in which the anorexic believes she's fat even though she's thin...if you feel anorexic, even if you're not already anorexic, you should talk to someone  about it. Even EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) is dangerous to your health.|`|054aa59e6412961caa59c4b6674bcee0aa	you're not fat. i'm 5'8" and 100 lbs, that is anorexic. you're fine, you don't need to lose weight.|`|8ae489877706e3ae1b6a08ea5236b06caa	you're a mental case|`|d36609d36eb192e2a54217c2c42209a2aa	Honey, I'm 5"3, weigh 142 pounds(that's 30 more than you) and I'm not fat. Get counsiling if you feel you really have a problem. To tell you the truth too not eating won't neccessarily make the pounds fly off, it'll just make you unhealthy. After a while, when your body is missing out on nutrients that fuel it(this means food) it goes into starvation mode, and will store up fat. Please eat, and get help.|`|62d059fc42a0bd49964ce419cfafa326aa	You are not fat!  You are at the size you should be, 115-120lbs is still normal. I'm 5'3'' too, i never liked my stomach, but i looked my best at about 115lbs.  that was about 3 years ago and now all the weight i gain seems to go to my gut. but you are at a good weight, please do not stop eating.  just eat small meals several times a day and that will keep up your metabolism.|`|AA12339663	its sad that you are anorexic and don't even know it.  If you are going without eating, that makes you anorexic.  I am sooo sick of everyone trying to be so skinny that they look absolutely gross.  Please be happy with who and what you are.  Eat right and get the right amount of exercise.  Then you'll be fine.|`|b75497b0b9d5dc51590f95d8ff5c827daa	It all depends on what your body looks like if your 5'3'' 112lbs but<br>  your body is tight then your probably ok.I would like to see a picture of you you sound hot.|`|f398934f538f3f02d7ab6555d5cd9103aa	you're too fat.<br>  i'm anorexic.<br>  don't even fckng start with your moaning.<br>  stop it.<br>  i'm 5'2 and weigh 100.<br>  let's be serious.<br>  no one cares.|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	You weigh an embarrassing 112lb? What is that all about, your weight is absolutely ideal. It sounds to me you have some disordered thinking regarding your weight and body. You may not be anorexic, but your thoughts tend to point toward some kind of body image disorder and this could become full blown anorexia if you don't sort this way of thinking out NOW.

mlAwNRWhaa	Usually, influenza lasts three to five days. If it goes on for more than a week or if the symptoms are very severe, you are advised to consult your doctor. <br>  <br>  A bad case of influenza has the potential to develop into a more serious condition like pneumonia or sinus trouble and in rare cases it can be life-threatening.<br>  <br>  I can also give you some cures:<br>  <br>  Drink as much as possible - you lose a lot of liquids during a fever.<br>  <br>  Rest, preferably by staying in bed.<br>  <br>  Try to get plenty of sleep.<br>  <br>  If you have a cough, an over-the-counter cough remedy may ease your symptoms. The pharmacist is the best person to advise on this.<br>  <br>  Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol.<br>  <br>  Paracetamol (eg Panadol, Calpol) or aspirin (eg Aspro clear) will reduce fever and muscle aches. (Note that aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years of age, unless on the advice of a doctor.) Ibuprofen (eg Nurofen) will also relieve these symptoms. These painkillers are also found combined with medicines such as nasal decongestants in various over-the-counter cold and flu remedies. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which are most suitable for relieving your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Consult a doctor if the symptoms do not disappear after a week, or sooner if you feel worse.|`|8UBax3edaa	I think it could last that long, but it shouldnt cuz i had the flu and it lasted for 7 days about.

Now a days there is a lot of different ways they can help with period pain. Sickness and pain during a period is nothing harmful or anything to be worried about. But don't make her suffer.|`|ZWyO9t7Caa	I have been in your daughters situation.  From age 14 to age 26 I went through hell every month.  I tried the pain killers but they made very little difference.  They just took the edge off at the best of times.  The things that really made a huge difference to me were a thing called Bowen Therapy (talk to a practitioner about this - it helps align the body), going on the pill and being dairy and gluten free because I have Coeliac Disease which affects my hormones.  I know that the pill and Bowen Therapy work wonders for women without Coeliac disease.  I can't recommend them highly enough.  I tried everything else including seeing a specialist and naturopath - neither worked.  I hope your daughter gets some relief. The other thing to do is to only use organic cotton tam<br>  pons and pads.  This will reduce her flow and bleeding.  Normal commercial products are manufactured to increase flow to sell more.<br>   I put off going on the pill for years because I was brought up in a very conservative household.  Now I wish I had done it years ago.  I also recommend you get her to see someone about the psychological damage these periods will have caused her.  Someone trained in treating post traumatic stress.

If you are asking if I have had other traumatic experiences besides the initial one then Yes.

A lady I worked with had PTSD related to her tour of duty in Iraq.  We worked next to a firearms range and she came unglued when they fire a particularly noisy weapon.  We find her under the desk.  Wouldn't you consider that being retraumatized?  People with PTSD may make irrational connections subconsciously that may result in symptoms presenting.  My husband has experienced this.

FHhA0cJxaa	Life coaches are for people who don't know their own minds.|`|MJdUkar5aa	Life coaches tend to be people who would really like to be psychologists but are not qualified. It can be dangerous for a person who is not trained in mental health issues to mess around with another person's head. <br>  <br>  Of course you can't achieve anything you want if you reall want it. If you are one legged person, you can't exactly become a ballet dancer can you? Or if you are born with a chronic disease or a deformity, you can't always get over it however much you may want to.<br>  <br>  This is ridiculous nonsense, similar to all of this 'The Secret' rubbish that was put about in a totally cynical fashion a couple of years ago by people who's main aim was to make money.<br>  <br>  If you want to sort your life out, speak to a good psychologist, social worker or a well trained counsellor.

If you have emotional issues that interfere with your life, for example, then a life coach is not for you - you need a trained therapist. If, however, you want help with identifying and prioritizing your goals, making plans to achieve them, and putting those plans into action, then a life coach might well be able to help you. But you have to do the work.<br>  <br>  Don't confuse life coaches with the motivational speakers you see on PBS selling CDs. Life coaching is grounded in reality. Having said that, "you can achieve anything you want if you really want it" is much more likely to be true than false for any given person. For every "one legged person who wants to be a ballet star" there are probably a hundred able-bodied people with the same wish who never get off the couch and try it.<br>  <br>  There are competent and incompetent people in any field, be it life coaching, psychotherapy, or accounting.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	I agree with Dr Frank basically.<br>  <br>  You mentioned that you have six stone to lose. One of the main problems that exists in medicine is Doctors and Nurses' failure to understand obesity or recognise the different categories of obesity. Whilst diet and exercise is the only real way to lose weight; if you are six stone or more over weight you need to look at why you are over weight in the first place and you need to recognise the difference between physical and emotional hunger.<br>  <br>  It is no point telling an obese person to simply 'eat more fruit and healthy foods' you can get fat eating fruit and other healthy foods if you eat too much of it. It's never what you eat, it's always how much (although you do need to eat a healthy diet).  The difference between a thin person and an overweight person is not what they eat, it's that ability to stop eating when they have had enough. The key is understanding what makes an overweight person have that extra mouthful, when physically their body is full. <br>  <br>  As I said, there are different categories of obesity. Diets such as the GI diet on it's own tends to work well for people who have a few stone to lose where it can be said that they have simply over indulged (which we all have the ability to do) or put on weight through periods of inactivity (due to illness etc). When people have got 5+ stone to lose, the problem is often more psychological. Some people actually have an addiction to food. And for some people, dealing with this underlying problem is the only way they are going to beat their obesity problem. <br>  <br>  The media likes to portray obese people as being lazy and greedy and I always think that is a very unfair portrayal. Although for some people this may be the case and some people are just overweight through bad eating habits etc; for some people quite often the problem is a lot deeper and many people are addicted to food in the same way some people are addicted to alcohol and drugs etc. <br>  <br>  This is why you hear so many obese people saying, "I have tried every diet and nothing works" This is because food is not the main issue.<br>  <br>  I don't know your actual circumstance, but I would suggest giving the GI diet a go, but bear in mind, providing you are eating the correct quota of food per day, hunger on top of this is likely to be more psychological than physical. If you are really struggling to lose weight and finding that you are craving food all the time, then ask your GP to refer you for CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). More and more Doctors are now realising the benefits of using CBT in conjunction with diet + exercise to tackle obesity. <br>  <br>  Best wishes for the future and apologies for my long winded answer.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It does help and at least there is some logic in it, basically it concentrates on foods that release energy slowly. This reduces your appetite and also helps blood sugar levels by putting less strain on the pancreas. This is good for diabetics and if you are not one at the moment, remain 6 stone overweight and you will be sooner or later. You can of course still eat too many calories on the GI diet.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you are going to struggle to lose 6 stone whatever diet you chose and you must firstly ensure that you set both smaller step targets and a realistic timescale. It is also absolutely essential that you combine your diet with VERY regular exercise. Even then you will be doing well if you average 4-5 lbs a month, so get set in your mind that this is a long term project, a couple of years at least.|`|ZMWjdKfraa	I have been dieting for 40 years and  I needed to lose 7 stone but have tried every diet,  potion , tea and tablet even the gi diet but never lost any significant amount of weight .<br>  Well that is until I got an ulcer , and the consequence of this I have to follow an alkaline diet , so no foods that have too much acid in them but  in the last 4 months I have lost 3 stone 2 pounds which is a Miracle for me .Why don't you try it there is no harm trying and it does give you loads of energy and I feel better than I have for years.<br>  edit<br>  Can I just add I didn't do any exercise, and I agree with the nurse , if you have a lot to lose then there are issues with food.<br>  But I didn't even lose weight when only eating 1250 to 1500 calories and walking 40 Min's a day<br>  until I started the alkaline eating. <br>  Doctors and Nurses can give you all the info and statistic's but only someone that has experienced just how hard for some people to lose weight can really say it like it is .I had a Doctor some years back that said stick to 800 calories a day and it doesnt matter where you get them from , it can be 4 gin and tonics if you want , well that was good advise wasnt it .

Despite what all you girls think, guys will usually never pick up on "signals" you have to be straight up with us so we know exactly what's happening.  some suggestions is that you work with your boyfriend as an assistant or just someone to help out.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|zeZtFbGjaa	im a former bulimic (ya i know) but im recovered now and very healthy<br>  <br>  Here's sum simple tips besides the obvious of exercises and eating healthy<br>  <br>  I used to eat from paper plates to absorbs any extra oils or fats<br>  <br>  eat plenty of chili as it increases your metabolism<br>  <br>  Give yourself treats as rewards eg a facial<br>  <br>  water before meals to fill you<br>  <br>  drink iced water as ur body uses Cal's to warm it up<br>  <br>  eating celery burns more cals, dan whats in d actual celery stick<br>  <br>  and eat from a small plate, wit a small spoon, and put in down between mouthfuls, and not infront of the tv, tricks your mind you've eaten loads<br>  <br>  Good Luck and remember be healthy!|`|152yEf1Jaa	Eating puri daily is a  detrimental thing to do.It will never allow the weight-loss.

u8CFwtyMaa	The foreskin is supposed to cover the head of the penis, to protect it, and keep it sensitive so that you get more pleasure from sex.<br>  The sensitivity will decrease in time, and if you can't keep the head covered with the foreskin, try wearing briefs to stop it moving around, and rubbing against your underwear. Once the sensitivity has decreased, you can go back to wearing boxers.<br>  I normally wear boxers, but wear briefs for training for this reason.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	You don't need a doctor.  It's pretty normal.  As you masturbate more and more the sensitivity will reduce to an acceptable level over time.  Use silk boxers btw.<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|XgO9HUm9aa	This is normal. Your penis will get used to it eventually.

AA12384954	Well I have low blood pressure, which is not a serious problem at all but I do have to be careful getting up some times as I can get close to blacking out sometimes.  If you have had a cold recently it could also possibly be a reaction to a middle ear infection that you may not as yet be aware of.  I have had a few ear drum operations, with mastoiditis, and as a result I find that I sometimes have a balance problem because of it, especially if I go from one temperature to a lower one quickly, or to a windy environment.  Wouldn't hurt getting a check up to determine if one of those scenarios is what you are experiencing.

84H5R5ywaa	High blood sugar: An elevated level of the sugar glucose in the blood. Also called hyperglycemia.<br>  <br>  High blood sugar is a finding in a number of conditions, most notably diabetes mellitus. Elevated blood glucose leads to spillage of glucose into the urine (glucosuria) so that the urine is sugary. (The term diabetes mellitus means "sweet urine.")<br>  <br>  Aside from diabetes, the many other causes of high blood sugar include just eating more sugar (or food) than usual, the presence of an infection or another illness, an injury and the stress of surgery.<br>  <br>  High blood sugar may produce few or no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they may be dry mouth, thirst, frequent urination, urination during the night, blurry vision, fatigue or drowsiness, weight loss, or increased appetite.<br>  <br>  An elevated level of blood sugar may be a useful independent indicator of heart disease risk. The risk of dying from heart disease has been found to rise as the level of blood glucose increases (regardless of age, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking status).
856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	Depression is caused by chemical imbalances of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and other important neurotranmitters in the brain which stabilize emotions. Psychologists state that depression is a unhealthy state which we can work through in order to experience greater levels of happiness. Some who daily experience deep chronic depression may require both medication prescribed by a Psychiatrist along with 'Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy {M.B.C.T.') provided by Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapists and there are some who experience chronic-but not deeply chronic depression who work well with M.B.C.T. alone. Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD along with Psychologists Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal have authored an excellent self-help book called: "The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness". Mindfulness, a simple yet powerful way of paying attention to your most difficult emotions and life experiences, can help you break the cycle of chronic unhappiness once and for all, that you may experience greater levels of happiness. In 'The Mindful Way through Depression', it is explained why our usual attempts to "think" our way out of a bad mood or "just snap out of it" leads us deeper into the downward spiral of depression. Through very insightful lessons-drawn from both Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy - Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD and Psychologists- Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal demonstrate how to sidestep the negative habits that lead to unhappiness and despair, including self-blame and rumination so you can effectively face life's challenges with much resilience.|`|ikm8hJYZaa	Depression is caused by the lack of serotonin in your brain which is caused by the lack of omega 3 fatty acids in your brain.A deficiency that most of the humans on this planet have.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mind you that you will never read this in most of the articles written by the main stream so called doctors because it goes against their interests and the interests of the corporations that finance them to seel their poison under the desguise of a cure.<br>  <br>  <br>  Omega 3 fatty acids raise your serotonin levels.The more you have the better you feel among many other benefits.<br>  <br>  <br>  Start the omega 3 diet.I have researched omega 3 acids for 2 years and performed a very successful experiment on myself and few of my volunteer friends.Few months of the omega 3 diet it significantly reduced stress[and/or cured depression] problems permanently and significantly raised my intelligence,improved memory,gave me high emotional and muscle control,sight,reflexes[and many other known and unknown benefits]and without any drugs or supplements in the form of pills.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/omega-3-fatty-acid-can-improve-memory-and-maintain-brain-health_1008874.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/heal...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v32/n3/abs/1301117a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v32/n3...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/021119.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalnews.com/021119.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/omega3-depression-what-is-depression-and-what-can-omega3-do-for-your-mental-health.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/omega3-de...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Take two table spoons of grinded flaxseed[rich with omega 3 and cheap]a day[with a glass of water] and in a few months you will start to notice significant improvement in your mental health[you will become more psychologically stable,among other things].Use a coffee grinder.Whole seeds cannot be digested by the hydrochloric acid in our stomach only grinded seeds.A fact and not a assumption.There are many articles on the internet about the omega 3 fatty acids.<br>  <br>  Flax is the best source of ALA omega 3 fatty acid which our body converts to more important fatty acids called DHA and EPA.For the efficient conversion to take place,foods containing a large amount of the following nutrients must be consumed along with the flaxseed:C,B3,B6 [vitamins],zink and Magnesium [minerals].I recommend 3 table spoons of flax with 100 grams[or more if to your liking] of almonds and/or 250g of green peas,1 kiwi every day.[do not take more then 3 table spoons of flax because large amounts can cause intestinal gases which can cause abdominal pain and/or constipation.If three spoons causes abdominal discomfort lower the dosage to 2 table spoons of grinded flax and elevate it to 3 table spoons after your body adapts to high fiber content].<br>  <br>  The information in the following link should provide you with the nutritional facts of most if not all known fruits and <br>  <br>  vegetables:<a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritiondata.com</a><br>  <br>  A healthy diet on a dialy basis is the only way to cure and prevent depression.There is no other way.|`|rBZjKDoVaa	go to your doctor and they'll prescribe something for you.|`|nXIK3rpQaa	I have been through something very similar and all I can say is, things will get better.

ZttGhvMTaa	You should get it checked out.. You could end up with a form of gigantism which is called Acromegaly. A girlfriend of mine found out she had this after looking through photos from a couple years prior and then ones more recent. She noticed her face and jawline was much larger inthe recent ones, her hands and feet got larger too. Another gal I used to work with had a growth on hers that caused this condition but she grew up with it. She now has a very large jaw and nose.

YCXxP43Laa	Congratulations on wanting to change... the willpower is half the battle won!<br>  <br>  Yes Wellbutrin contains the same active ingredient that is in Zyban; which as I'm sure you know is a smoking cessation drug, so you cannot take the two together.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is good for major depressive episodes, so your doctor may want to try other antidepressants first, but if you explain your desire to stop smoking for the sake of your children (and yourself) and explain that you know that Wellbutrin contains the same ingredient as Zyban they may be more sympathetic.<br>  <br>  Any kind of antidepressant is good if you feel you cannot cope without it, I used to drink heavily until I took Prozac, and overnight I stopped drinking, even though it is not a side effect of it, but then feeling better made a difference.<br>  <br>  Be aware if you could possibly have bipolar then you are risk of a mixed manic episode, but you would know very soon if that were the case. Also all antidepressants have a risk of increased suicidal thoughts; don't want to scare you but just be aware, and the chance is very slim.<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing for your babies and the will to stop and change makes any kind of cessation program more likely to succeed.<br>  <br>  To help with your hands have you thought about knitting something for your little ones? <br>  <br>  Good luck, with your dedication and motivation I have every belief you will succeed!|`|24mub7pHaa	it is marketed under the name ZYBAN but it is exactly the same drug as wellbutrin|`|pDtoi6FUaa	welltutrin or better know as "bupropheon" helps with both anxiety, depression, and adhd. im currentley a smoker and taking this medication. it has helped me stop smoking most of the time but yet i still find myself smoking more and more. i hope i helped|`|KeEFuf7zaa	your answer is in the site in my sources|`|T64zP6fgaa	I quit after 40 plus years , a small miracle, by using Chantix for about four months...<br>  I didnt even go by the directions, i just started taking it, and went about my business normally even smoking... in about two and a half months it kicked in  ( i wasnt sure it would by then) and blocked the nicotine receptors in my brain, and i am telling you the truth, i just woke up one morning and didnt want a cigarette,,... no cravings, nothing.... this was amazing to me,<br>  it has been a year and i still dont want a cigarette.....  i used herbal formulas by seven forests to calm me down a couple times|`|m26HiCNhaa	I do have to congratulate you on wanting to change your habits for your children. That is high motivation for you to stop smoking, and I have every belief that you will. Anyone that would leave an answer assaulting or degrading you for that has no business being here. Everyone makes mistakes, no matter how perfect they think they are. You are one of the few that openly admit to your mistakes, and are working to correct it.<br>  <br>  From my experience in the health care field, Welbutrin can be used to help aid a smoking cessation program, but only using Welbutrin alone will probably not help you stop smoking altogether. It has been used to help cocaine addicts in recovery, but it is combined with other, more potent, medications to cleanse the system and negate the cravings. Welbutrin works to regulate the bupropion levels in the blood, which can bring a general feeling of well being. That alone just may be enough to help you stop smoking, but usually not. It is one of the milder anti-depressants out there, and it will leave you able to take care of your children without making you too groggy or zombie like. <br>  <br>  If you want to try the alternative medicine route, I would suggest 5-HTP or Sam-e. Kava Kava is good, but many people have allergic reactions to it, so if you want to take it, I would start out slowly. St. John's Wort is also a good anti-depressant. It's effects are subtle, but it works. Lobelia is the herbal ingredient in many smoking cessation products, and purchasing Lobelia capsules alone are less expensive than smoking cessation gum or patches. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  As far as needing something to do with your hands, wearing a rubber band around your wrist can give you something to play with when you start getting anxious. Or carrying a paper clip in your pocket.

3489c076a022e1d2b31875be5ea7c150aa	I'm 32 and I suffered from hideous symptoms for 13 years. Vomiting, mood swings, pain so bad I couldn't walk, constipation, bloating, spots, migraines and sleeplessness - it was hideous. I would try to plan my holiday's around it - but I was so irregular that it was hit and miss. I saw GP after GP and even the women prescrbed anti-inflamatories and said "Bad Luck". A year ago I found a wonderful family planning gyne who agreed to put me back on the pill (I had been taken off it due to the mirgaines). She explained that the symptoms were due to my own body's withdrwal from my natural estrogen. Now, I take the pill for 21days and have an HRT patch for the 7 days in the middle. I bearly notice my period besides a small abdominal twinge and a 2 day bleed. I think that Dr saved my life. I was going insane! Good luck - and if you're GP won't refer you to a specialist - try your local Family Planning or GUM clinic. Trust me 5mins in the stirrups is worth it for a better life! Good luck! (In the meantime peppermint tea always helpd).

4bZou8qQaa	Most prescriptions are valid for one year from the day it was written. If it is classified as Controlled or Narcotic, the expiration is usually sooner. Your prescription for birth control will expire on October 27, 2009.

mlAwNRWhaa	did you get that from your parents? because there are many cases that acquiring that is through genes... Its hereditary... if it is, observe if the parent or relative where you got those fingers from no longer has "chubby fingers"...<br>  <br>  well if you are a skinny kid who has fingers not usual to what your body's size is, they may have the chance to slim down when your body stretch due to growing up... dont worry, your just 13...<br>  <br>  keep in mind that 'Nobody is Perfect'|`|Qz3IXj5kaa	You're only 13 - and you're probably already starting puberty. Don't worry about your fingers.<br>  <br>  If you do want to worry, just make sure you get the calcium and iron you need - calcium for bones (puberty is when you start shooting up, so make sure you have your daily recommended amount) and iron (since you'll be starting periods and need just a little more whenever your menses occurs.)
FSdXAuSlaa	Honestly what do you think? Smoking is going to increase your risk of getting periodontal disease like gingivitis or periodontits. Once acquired smoking will also make it harder for you to cure that disease.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	Smoking is the number one cause of periodontal disease.
2dacea660561bddc5e448a614dd7f5efaa	Yes, you might.  If you fast, when you break the fast your body will crave nutrients.  You'll find it almost impossible not to eat a lot to compensate.<br>  <br>  Juice fasting is good as a cleansing technique, to clean out your system and re-set it.  No fast is really effective for weight loss in the long run, because it crashes your metabolism, and then you put weight on even more when you go off it.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to exercise every day when you go off the fast to try to get your metabolism ramped back up to normal.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	I know it is common in some religions to fast although I would not recommend doing it for any other reason.<br>  <br>  You could gain weight back, fasting is merely starving yourself and it tricks your body's metabolism slowing it down. Once you start eating again you could experience weight gain as the body is adapting to the metabolic change.<br>  <br>  This is extremely common in yoyo dieters, they either fast or choose unstable diets which result in rapid weight drop, then throw the diet once they reach their goal and put the pounds back on and ended up worse off than when they started.|`|aBazvBnAaa	its a fact you will, it will all go back on... thats why fasting is a big fail LOL
9OyIL8P9aa	No it is not a miscarriage. A miscarriage does not start off with brown blood. You will have dark heavy red blood with tons of pain in the belly . Trust me I had one back in December.<br>  What you had is called "old blood" or known as break through bleeding, because you never went back to get the remaining of your birth control. I would honestly suggest that you do go and get the rest of it if you are having unprotected sex. <br>  I hope that this helps.|`|sUH902cDaa	No its more likely to be break through bleeding where you body has just come off of the birth control shot and your about to go back to your usual cycle.
0MunIx8raa	You need to make time for a doctor.  Sounds like you may have bronchitis or some other upper respiratory infection.  Infections require antibiotics.  Something seems to be going on with your lungs with not being able to breathe easily and the dizziness can be caused from not getting enough oxygen and a high fever.  I am no doctor, but have 2 kids and have seen it all.  Go to the doctor.|`|AA10834046	Don't have time for a doctor?  What could be more important than your health?  Go to the doctor, now.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	The flu maybe, take Tylenol to reduce your fever. You sound like your busy too and that will make you more stressed and sicker! Take some time for yourself! At least go take a warm bath to relax! If you get worse you should go to the Dr though, you could have Strep or something.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Maybe flu, cold or strep throat.  If you're not going to the doctor at least get you some meds.  That will tide you over until your fever breaks, you come to you senses and realize you do need the doctor after all.|`|psLk5fDGaa	An upper respiratory infection? My mom just had all the same symptoms and that is what she had... You need an antibiotic no matter what.|`|AA11711847	HIV+|`|mkyFiylSaa	it sounds like flu.
YCXxP43Laa	I don't know how tall you are but you are not overweight. At 15 a lot of girls still have pre pubescent figures, and when you begin to fill out you can carry a bit of puppy fat; most often though you just look more curvy than the girls who develop later.<br>  <br>  It is not funny to be anorexic... it is not about looking thin, it is about control, otherwise everyone who starts a diet would be.<br>  <br>  Anorexia is a MENTAL ILLNESS, not a weight loss plan!  <br>  <br>  I've been anorexic, and been hospitalized, it is not funny, and very bad for your health, long and short term.<br>  <br>  Try to eat healthily and exercise, please do not go down the road to self destruction.<br>  <br>  Btw anorexia will make you less attractive, you'll have to wear baggy clothes to stop feeling cold; so people won't see how thin you are, your hair will become thin, you will get an increase of fine downy hair all over your body, your periods will stop. If you develop bulimia you will get bad teeth, a puffy face, blood shot eyes and serious health problems.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Im over 9stone too, of athletic build, u eva considered ai maybe muscle. Muscle weighs heavier than fat.  Cant believe u would ask such a stupid question; "how do I become anorexic?" u know there are some girls really ill and suffering from eating disorders!!! Go to your gym and ask for proper advice!!!!!!!|`|m16dhfrGaa	Anorexics are really unattractive.  They are totally self-obsessed, thin like they have something terminal (and they do, of course.  They have voluntary starvation) and they have no nice muscle tone to give them shape.  <br>  <br>  So, what you could think about is turning the fat into muscle.  You can do this in front of the TV if you get the right exercises.  Do some research into this and try not to dismiss things because they are not 'fast'.  Weight that comes off fast will go back on fast.  Eating more fibre and vegetables and exercising will make you feel and look better, as well as helping to ensure your long term health.  At 15 you are still developing new body tissues, make sure you build them properly.  I know it's old advice, but you are what you eat.  Lots of fresh fruit is good.  Oranges are a kind of natural laxative.  Eat them freely.|`|Qz3IXj5kaa	Anorexia is a deadly mental illness that can KILL. Sufferers may seem fashionably thin but are not in the pink of health and are often depressed and suicidal, and suffer for many years before recovering. Some don't recover at all, and Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses.<br>  <br>  This is a horrible question to ask and really - you should be questioning WHY the media is telling everyone to be thin. It is unreasonable, it is outrageous, and it is downright stupid.|`|JXw0U77aaa	Screw you, idiot.

If you want to lose even a little bit I suggest becoming more active.|`|kFjNO9Yjaa	anorexia is a serious mental condition that ruins your physical appearance. i cannot even believe you have asked how to put your mind and body through such a torment. your weight seems healthy. just stick to meals that are low in fat and eat more fruit and vegetables and do at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day to stay in shape. but please do not become anorexic as it can kill...<br>  stay healthy nikki :)|`|TqeJ5CTPaa	oh god. please don't do this. do you understand that people die from this? i'm 14, and i weigh 80 pounds. No, im not anorexic, i just have a very high metabolism, and i am terrified about skipping a meal because i could lose 3 pounds just from that. Why would you want to starve yourself, and die just for people to stop thinking that you are fat? please talk to someone about this first.|`|3489c076a022e1d2b31875be5ea7c150aa	At 15 you are dealing with so many issues that sometimes your sense of reasoning gets a little distorted. As you get older you will learn different priorities in life. Anorexia is a serious disease that people die from. You don't say how tall you are. Have you checked your BMI? You should be somewhere between a score of 20 and 25 - my friend died of anorexia aged 17 with a BMI of 9. Do you want to smoke too? That kills. Do you like to run out in front of cars? Anorexia is as much a mental as an eating disorder. Keep your mind on track, take up a sport and if you want to feel thinner eat lots of celery, it deals with bloating and water retention and will make you feel less fat. Make sure you stick to 3 proper meals a day and increase your activity levels. If you bacome undernourished at the age of 15 you risk lots of very painful and serious helth problems later in life, when I say later I mean in your 20's not your 60's. you could jeopardise your ability to have childern too. Think about things. how would your family feel? How would those that love you feel knowing you were slowly and painfully killing yourself?|`|BUHNo4myaa	You do NOT want to be anorexic! I faced anorexia when I was younger and it's a living HELL. Mtv says, and so does my mom, that to eat lots of oatmeal and exercise a lot! They say you'll loose weight fast! I think I might try it!|`|GO43F0mwaa	My advice is to go to your doctor, you sound like you need professional help.  Anorexia isn't healthy and can kill you.|`|aMBQLNGqaa	Go see a doctor please for your family and your own sake...|`|J9ZRpZ8caa	Gain some common sense, first..

Possibly slightly increase the size in thickness and a tiny bit in length because it will be harder because of the increased blood flow.<br>  <br>  It may also allow you to go more times without losing your erection or having to take a break.<br>  <br>  If you drink lots of water and have half of the food you eat be green vegetables for 3 weeks you will notice a massive difference in your erection and also the way you feel by then.<br>  <br>  They also say brocolli increases your testostorne and watermelon may be a natural viagra.<br>  <br>  Take ZMA if your medicine allows an hour before bed on an empty stomach this will increase test levels and also help you sleep a little better|`|3jjOpK0aaa	You could try viagra but I will tell ya what,  that stuff sucks.  The side effects are terrible.  Have you ever tried a sexual enhancer?  I was in your situation,  like  I said,  viagra was tried but it wasn't for me considering the side effects overwhelm the pleasures of it.  I found this natural herbal enhancer and figured what the heck,  if it's natural it must be great and plus it said no side effects.  I tried it and after about two days of taking it I was just horny like a mad man.  All the time,  I have erections that want to stand straight up and the orgasms are to die for.  The stuff was called vigrx plus and I saved on it at the time at <a href="http://hughs-reviews.com," rel="nofollow">http://hughs-reviews.com,</a>   You should check it out.  I love the fact it's made from a researched blend of herbs that seem to do the trick for me atleast.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|s0xJbnfIaa	Prosource Androtest Extreme. It's a weightlifting supplement (w/ the side effect you are looking for). I am not sure if it contains HGW, which I understand does not go well with your current medications.<br>  Any of that "other" stuff won't help, despite the great advertising angles. <br>  This said, at 21, your body should produce ample amounts of testosterone on it's own. I know, everyone hates to hear this, but perhaps you should ask your doctor. If it's really low, they can medically treat you the correct way.<br>  If I were you...and I once was at that age, I'd just give it some time. Chances are, most of it is in your head. A mental block that is suppressing your drive. I'd look for answers there first before running off getting your body loaded with herbs and mixes that are not regulated by the FDA and the side effects are not widely studied like in prescription pharmaceuticals. <br>  Messing with test boosters is ill advised at your age.<br>  Any of the advice you get here will most likely be pure opinion and speculation, you really do need to consult your doctor if it is a big issue for you. There could be underlying physical and emotional issues that would only be masked by medications and supplements.<br>  Treat the illness, don't compensate for the symptoms.<br>  A daily weight training regimine and getting in the best shape possible will help to naturally increase your hormone levels. At 21, nothing will help you more then a good workout in the gym and confidence in yourself and your apperance.

MYRm9nMbaa	Try Miralax (not the same as Metamucil, which is fiber), a powder formulation laxative, now available over the counter, that you mix into liquids such as water or juice. May take 2-4 days to work, but it's gentle on your system and typically does not cause 'urgency'. If you are still having problems, see your doctor, as you may need to be sure that you don't have an obstruction.|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Try this self massage and exercise a couple of times, that should help: <a href="http://best-constipation-cures.com/constipation-relief/" rel="nofollow">http://best-constipation-cures.com/const...</a>|`|AA10834046	Have you been to the doctor to see if something is wrong?|`|uwaAcgyiaa	Sounds like what ever you have been eating has caught up with you..... its more than likely your diet, go see a naturopth and they will tell you what to eat for it to go away and for your system to work properly.

Drinking more water and strong teas can be very helpful. Drinking coffee is also a good way to increase bowel movements.|`|E2IaiCpyaa	Take a teaspoon of mineral oil.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	The mineral oil is a good idea.  You should also try prunes.  They get a really bad rap as they're really quite delicious.  Try the dried ones and eat plenty of them and drink gallons of water.  Exercise is also very helpful.<br>  <br>  However, as another reader pointed out, you should see a doctor as this is no laughing matter.  You could also have a blockage and that is very serious.<br>  <br>  If you have been taking anything like Vicodin or anything with codeine, it can easily create this situation.  Aside from yogurt, avoid milk products, especially cheese.  Other foods, frequently chocolate, can cause this problem, too.<br>  <br>  You don't mention suppositories, but they're another option.  Try the prunes and wait one or two more days before calling the doctor.|`|dPseE8XUaa	go to a doctor as soon as possible. my uncle died from heavy constipation.|`|jLfLTfYFaa	Are u on new meds that might cause this??i would recommend taking another enema to empty yourself, then get yourself on Metamucil.  You can take up to three Metamucil's a day (orange is the best) just mix the powder with juice and drink it quickly...once u start taking them  u should be fine, especially if u have never had this prob..something must be causing it...this worked like a charm for me and i have had probs with constipation since i was a child..hope this works hun!!Email me if u want and let me know how u made out.
zvG0cbeMaa	pretty much everyone says there uselesss, and a waste of money. <br>  the only ones that would probably work are the ones with laxative (make you crap alot) and i donnnno if it would actually work that much on someone who hasnt got a whole lot to lose, anything else could give you very bad side affects.<br>  so id try just doing it the plain old healthy 'boring' way, diet and excercise, it also wont coz you a dime:)<br>  <br>  but if you do come across a magic one that works without side affffect please let me know:)|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Yes and no.

I started losing weight the very first week. So far I've lost 14.4 lbs. in 5 weeks with this diet!  It shows you exactly what to eat and when to eat it. It gives you a choice of foods and it prepares an 11-day menu for you. The foods are everyday items that you can find in any grocery store like lunch meat, chicken, fruits, vegetables, cashews, sausage, eggs, etc...  The trick is in the types of calories you eat and when you eat them. By shifting your calories you can boost your metabolism to burn more fat. You can read my story here...<br>  <a href="http://www.preferreddiets.com/post/2009/02/28/How-I-lost-Weight-Quickly-Using-the-Calorie-Shifting-Diet.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.preferreddiets.com/post/2009/...</a>|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Do not do these dangerous fasts, they are dangerous on the body!!! To help speed upyour metabolism I recommend jogging, slowly first then once u got the hang then u can start proper running. The thing is with these fasts is tht they are unheakthy, remember your body needs fats and glucose!!! Another problem with them is that you will put the weight back on, no doubt about it.  Eat 5times a day; small meals which consist of; protein, veg, fruit and carbs remeber your water too, another aid yo weight loss.  Make yourself homemade healkthy soups for work along with a sandwich and split them into 2-3meals throughout the day, then a small meal for tea. Goodluck.

Mais cela n'implique pas mentale. Neanmoins, c'est souvent avec les règles que les jeunes filles commence à réaliser à quoi peut servir leur corps et comment il fonctionne. Cette connaissance par la suite leur donne plus de maturité pour prendre une décision (mais pas toujours). De plus, statistiquement, les premières règles arrivent de plus en plus t?t. Avant c'était 16 ans et maintenant il n'est pas rare de voir des filles de 12 ans avoir leurs règles. Après cette petite réflexion il est normal de se poser des question sur ton age. Je te conseille donc d'attendre, d'en parler avec des personnes de ton entourage (et non à des étranger qui ne savent rien sur toi). Et si tu ne peux vraiment pas attendre alors protège toi: les MST ?a existe et de plus, il y a quand même un risque de grossesse (imagine que pile ta première ovulation soit à ce moment là). Mais bon, je continue à penser que si tu n'as pas encore eu tes règles alors ton corps n'est pas prés, n'a pas finit de m?rir et que ?a risque d'être une mauvaise expérience (pouvant entra?ner plus tard des problèmes dans ta sexualité).|`|42f2023ced2bd7c08ce9ddbf10c957eeaa	surtout ne tiens pas compte de la réponse de tonio. il a tout faux, car tu peux tomber enceinte.Mais tout d'abord , apprend donc à écrire.

3122aa204fb96d7fa6986b0ad324b628aa	In order to build endurance, start off with a couple of miles first at the pace you are comfortable with. Pick up the pace near the end of the run. Gradually add in more mileage every couple of days and really work on mental toughness--don't quit if you're near the end! Just say to yourself:"hey i just did (5) miles, I can do one more!" Convince yourself you are not tired. Always remember that everyone gets tired during runs. Not many people know that running is the best way to get in shape--I guarantee very soon you will realize you are so much stronger than before. Be proud and good luck on your run! Hope this helps :)|`|AA12389468	You could start at a really fast pace and trust me it works because then your body regulates to it and it just gets use to it.That helped me a lot when i ran.

8bebc7032da56bf59d8bfe816653b4a5aa	Here's three sites I found that you could check out.  I have had acupuncture and found it to be quite beneficial.  However, I have not experienced the needles in the areas suggested by these practitioners.  Everybody responds differently to different types of energy work, and just because one therapy didn't produce any significant difference for one person doesn't mean it won't for another.  Good luck in your quest.  I hope this therapy helps.  If it doesn't, please don't give up -- there any many different alternative and complimentary therapies available.  You may also want to try homeopathy, sound energy healing, and hands-on treatments (Reiki, healing touch, health kinesiology), too.

If you are more than so many hours late with taking a pill (as instructed on your pill instructions) you are supposed to miss that pill and take the next day as usual.  You are also then supposed to use additional contraception (condom) for 14 days.<br>  <br>  If you bled for 2 weeks then there would be no lining of your womb to be shed for another period.<br>  <br>  I would go and see the Doctor who prescribed them as you need to be checked out and also re-educated about how to take your pills.

(50 carbs, 25 protein) use about the same after you work out. Basically eat everything in site. high protein, high Carbs and moderate fat (unsaturated and monounsaturated)

Or try some o.t.c products first like Enzyte or suppliments like horny goat weed. Stop smoking/drinking, get some excercise and have a healthy diet and try the otc's then if it doesnt work, call the doctor.

Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)|`|458faf1b5ff95a40f495d81cb1396706aa	Helpful Tips to lose weight <br>  <br>  Many people are really exasperated with the same old tips for weight loss. Therefore we have added a few different tips to lose weight below:<br>  <br>  Always find a chance to move around. Do not use a vehicle if you are able to walk. Preferably run around if you have the time. Almost 70% of your calories are burned in this process. Instead of depending on magical ways to lose weight, apply your own efforts by eating less and moving more.<br>  <br>  Reduce your junk food intake and stick to wholesome foods such as fruits and vegetables. Imagine your body as the machine to burn your weight and actually perform the workouts.<br>  Do not plan dieting because it is not a solution for a longer duration. You can easily feel tired by following a particular diet pattern for a shorter duration. It reduces your rate of metabolism by draining away the water content and retaining the fat content.<br>  <br>  Schedule an exercise program almost daily and gradually increase your workout. Reduce one spicy meal in a week and work towards healthy meal consumption.<br>  <br>  Think in realistic terms and decide to lose about one to two pounds per week. Even if you lose weight rapidly you will revert back to the original weight soon. Contact people who have successfully lost weight and follow the same procedures they have tried out.<br>  <br>  So if you follow these tips you are sure to achieve your targeted goal and lose weight consistently.|`|054aa59e6412961caa59c4b6674bcee0aa	i'm tired of questions like this. if you want to lose weight, don't look for a quick fix because there aren't any that actually work. <br>  exercise, eat healthy, you will lose weight. it doesn't happen overnight.|`|85eb397592fea0bd8ddb4dc3df624c16aa	dont eat, im tired of this question!|`|AA11103556	it depends on if you want to be healthy or not|`|ebc3ee5bd489e60138d64aff6dc1c3a2aa	Jump in the air.

4e15bfe4d834d7b7e74e7b2a49957fa0aa	Have you officially been diagnosed with OCD for these symptoms? The reason I ask is because your symptoms sound more like generalized anxiety disorder. <br>  <br>  OCD is an obsession with something (like germs) and acting on it in an exessive manner (like cleaning obsessively). However, your symptoms seem more like a fixated fear of HIV and substances that could spread the disease than the obsession and compulsion that is the trademark of OCD. <br>  <br>  I suggest talking to your doctor or psychiatrist about what you described here. He or she may decide to give you meds that will help with the anxiety related to these thoughts. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|1c51b6d42ce1ced424851d2e52afa514aa	Just remember that HIV has to have a way to get in.If your hands are in good shape,then the virus can't get into your bloodstream.If you get too carried away(and hand sanitizers can be drying),your hands will crack and bleed,then you could have a REAL problem.If you do wash your hands a lot,keep lotion handy.Just try to be rational about it.That helps.It took a few years for the rational part of my brain to kick in,but now,I have very few OCD symptoms.I kind of miss alphabetizing things...|`|AA11239928	That's why you wash your hands a least very time you go to the bathroom or about to eat.

AA12163246	I'm autistic, and I'll try to answer your question.<br>  <br>  Autism is a neurological configuration that exists from birth, so no, it wouldn't just randomly develop when a person is an adult. However, a person can appear autistic when they haven't before if they have been pretending to be non-autistic their whole life and have either crashed or have decided that they don't want to pretend to be someone else any more. We can also experience shifts in skill sets throughout life that lead to us appearing more autistic. The article "Help! I Seem To Be Getting More Autistic!" over at autistics.org elaborates more on the reasons that we can suddenly (or not so suddenly) appear more autistic.<br>  <br>  I don't have a brief definition for autism (most of the definitions that I've seen on the web have major problems), so I'll use a modified version of the answer I gave to someone asking the same question yesterday, editing out the second person pronouns since, as far as I know, you're not autistic. The "us" and "we" are in reference to other members of the autistic community and me.<br>  <br>  Being autistic means that one has a neurological configuration different from the norm (those of us in the autistic community call non-autistics neurotypicals or NTs). It doesn't mean that one is wired defectively, just differently. Our senses are different from NT senses: we tend to be either hypo- or hyper- sensitive to sensory stimuli of different sorts, have an increased incidence of synesthesia (a crossing between senses,  to use an example from my experience, the ring of a telephone looks like a red spiralling corkscrew), have difficulty parsing speech (central auditory processing disorder). Some of our sensory sensitivities can put us at a disadvantage in a society designed for NTs - for example, many of us can see fluorescent flicker, which can result in anything from minor irritation, to headaches, to falling asleep. We do something called stimming, which includes things like flapping our hands, rocking back and forth, listening to the same piece of music repeatedly, and jumping up and down. This allows us to deal with sensory stimuli so that we don't become overloaded, and also lets us get the extra stimulation we may need. Lots of NTs try to stop us from stimming, but while bigots may dislike it, it's necessary for us to function in this world.<br>  <br>  Most NTs and many autistics think that being autistic means that one has poor social skills and lacks empathy. In reality, we have autistic social skills and so have trouble interacting with NTs, but are usually just fine with other autistics. While NT social interaction generally takes the form of intrusive give and take interactions, we do better in parallel. We can be successful with NTs, as long as they are willing to do their half of the work to communicate with us and we can have trouble interacting with other autistics if they have been trained to pretend to be NT or if we have not been allowed opportunities to interact with our own kind. We're also just fine at empathizing with other autistics, and no more lacking in empathy than neurotypicals. Most normal-brained people have difficulty empathizing with autistics. That's why they bully us, why they think that a particular therapy (ABA) that invalidates who we are and tries to replace us with a neurotypical person is helpful, and why they so often excuse the murder of autistics. (Not saying that all neurotypicals are like that, just that many are.)<br>  <br>  We also tend to have 1-3 very intense interests, called perseverations. Mine is autism, specifically autistic advocacy, if you couldn't tell already. *g* These are a good thing, and we need to have time to focus on these interests. Monologuing on them isn't bad, in fact, it's one of the parts of natural autistic interaction. If one can't do that, though, it doesn't mean they're necessarily non-autistic. I'm the same way with sharing my interests through speech, I learned to hide them from the time I was about 8 years old. I just don't consider that a good thing, since I would like to be able to discuss my perseverations in real life and not just online.<br>  <br>  Oh, and we tend to have difficulties with spoken communication as well, though some of us are eventually fine with it. We're almost always better with text than with speech and usually have trouble with telephones. We have trouble with the figurative language that NTs use, often have trouble with slang, are straightforward in our words, and are often echolalic, meaning that we repeat things that we've heard over and over again.<br>  <br>  So far, it seems that autism is genetic - our parents tend to have autistic traits themselves, and we usually have relatives on the autistic spectrum. Autism is not mercury poisoning, and not food allergies.<br>  <br>  Social disorder? Hmm... I'm guessing you mean in the context of autism and not just in general. The term is generally just used to mean difficulty with social interaction, but like I've pointed out, autistics aren't disordered socially with most other autistics.<br>  <br>  Read through the autistics.org information library and through www.gettingthetruthout.org for more information about autism. What's especially important to understand about autism and autistics is that we don't necessarily want to be cured and that whether or not we want to be cured depends  on whether we've been raised to think of ourselves as defective based on our wiring and not on what arbitrary functioning label we have been given.|`|98fdbd5cd1b814cad2a0336c5272ae4faa	lots of good info on www.autismweb.org

Always leave leftovers (if there are any) right next to you, so if you pass out from an insulin induced coma, when you wake you immediately have something to reach for...cold pizza is the best!  It is very important that every meal you push your stomach to its limits, in order to stretch it to its maximum capacity.  The will allow for more and more food intake per sitting.

Les sympt?mes éventuels peuvent appara?tre dans les jours ou les mois suivant l'infection.<br>   <br>  Parmi les sympt?mes de l'herpès génital figurent boutons de fièvre, vésicules et coupures, picotements ou sensations de br?lure sur les parties génitales et sympt?mes grippaux (dont maux de tête, douleurs et courbatures, fièvre).<br>   <br>  Pourquoi le traiter?<br>  Lorsque vous avez une éruption d'herpès génital, le virus est actif, mais même lorsque les sympt?mes disparaissent, cela ne signifie pas que vous n'êtes plus infectée, mais simplement que le virus est ? dormant ?. Le virus de l'herpès simplex ne se guérit pas, mais il existe différents traitements pouvant accélérer la cicatrisation en cas d'éruption. Ils peuvent également réduire le nombre d'éruptions.<br>   <br>  Que dois-je faire si je pense l'avoir contracté?<br>  Si vous pensez peut-être avoir contracté l'herpès génital, consultez votre médecin ou votre gynécologue pour faire des analyses.<br>   <br>  Traitement<br>  Le traitement est simple, avec un des différents médicaments existant sous plusieurs formes, exemple comprimés ou crème.

Cela peut se produire n'importe où mais les endroits les plus fréquents sont la bouche (les lèvres) et les organes génitaux (dont le vagin chez la femme). C'est contagieux, c'est pour cela que lorsque l'herpès se trouve sur les organes génitaux on le considère comme une MST (maladie sexuellement transmissible).<br>  Quand on a été infecté par l'herpès, le virus reste pour le restant de la vie dans l'organisme. Il y a des gens chez qui tout se passe bien car le virus ne se manifeste pas et il y en a d'autres qui sont très gênés car le virus ressort souvent (il ressort toujours au même endroit).<br>  Quand on fait une poussée d'herpès, on n'est pas obligé de se traiter, car cela ne change pas grand chose à la durée de la poussée, mais il faut faire attention de ne pas contaminer une autre personne => pas de bisous si l'herpès est sur la bouche et pas de rapports sexuels non protégés si c'est les organes génitaux. <br>  L'herpès vaginal peut poser un gros problème en cas de grossesse car il faut à tout prix éviter que le bébé passe à travers le vagin si il y a une poussée d'herpès. Donc cela nécessite une surveillance importante et d'éventuels traitements  que je ne veux pas détailler ici.<br>  est-ce que cela te suffit comme réponse?|`|ff42b477ca6e33654bcadd08176afa26aa	Il s'agit d'une maladie sexuellement transmissible qui ne se guérit malheureusement pas ! mais oh va consulter un gyné qui te donnera plus de détails en attendant tu peux aller sur www.doctissimo.com et bien t'imprégner de cette maladie.

cbf249103b57cc661a28952a60623a87aa	Do not go for a diet fad, all our bodies are different, so why follow the same diet for all of them?  Here are some tips to help you lose weight!<br>  <br>  Drink at least 8 glasses of cold water every day. Cold water actually uses up calories because your body can't use the water when it is too cold, so it uses energy to heat it up.<br>  <br>  *Stop drinking soda and sugary juices all together, they do nothing but harm your body.<br>  <br>  *Eat smaller meals, but more meals throughout the day. Never skip a meal, because you skip a meal, overeat at the next meal, feel bad, skip another meal, overeat again, ect. DOES NOT WORK!<br>  <br>  *Veggies and fruits are your friends! Plus, eating pomigranite (the actual fruit) can curb your appetite, plus it will take you a full hour to pick out all that stuff in the actual fruit :)<br>  <br>  *When you eat, be sure to sit up straight and have a little pillow on your lower back. This will help your brain realize it is full. It takes the brain 15-20 minutes to realize you are full!<br>  <br>  *When you eat, take 3 bites, a sip of cold water, 3 bites, sip of cold water. This will help your brain realize it is full.<br>  <br>  *Get smaller plates and smaller knives and forks. Why? Studies show that a group of people with big bowls and giant spoons will eat TONS of ice cream before full. While people who have little bowls and need to eat the ice cream with tiny sample spoons still eat that little bowl of ice cream, and they feel satisfied and full!|`|c52a45d42afed88f6a35e2e64a19790aaa	heres my choice:<br>  <br>  eat a LOT of veggies , or u can eat a LITTLE serving of meat . <br>  * three or four servings: meaning eat BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER .

Start lifting weights 3-4 times a week for the upper body strength that you will need for baseball (Important: Start w/ relatively light weights, then gradually work yourself up to heavier weights).<br>  Diet: Cut down on the junk/fatty foods and sodas (occasional treats, its unrealistic to cut them out completely). Incorporate more veggies/fruits/protein into your diet. For protein, try eating lean meats (chicken, fish) grilled or baked--not fried. Drink the reccommended 8 glasses of water daily. *Avoid fad diets*

Lots! and not alcohol, coffee or soft drinks, because they will only dehydrate you more. I drink lots, so I know it can get boring when you are drinking litre after litre of water, so I substitute or dilute with fruit juice (there are soooo many: if the fruit can be liquified, and it won't poison you, you can add it to water), cordial, sports drinks (gatorade, etc), soymilk, rice milk, oat milk, tea (green or herbal only - even without black, there are still 1000s to choose from), and many others I can't think of right now.<br>  Whenever you feel the need to eat, even when your hungry but choose not to eat, fill your stomach up with lots of liquid and proceed directly to the toilet.

c0e2cf59d8b4920c8a2d4b3c14fa71b2aa	On n'en guerit jamais completement. C'est effectivement une maladie qui doit etre traitee, avec un soutien psychologique adequat. Ce qui signifie qu'il doit etre important et discret, parce qu'on n'aime pas etre constament sous la loupe. Identifier les causes n'est pas facile. Et faire reprendre confiance ne l'est pas plus. La vision de son propre corps est biaisee. Soit on ne se voit pas maigre, soit on le nie (ce qui veut dire qu'on le sait). Parfois, ceci va effectivement jusqu'a la mort: le corps perd peu a peu tous ses muscles, tous ses nutriments. l'absence d'alimentation - par refus d'alimentation ou vomissement car les boulimiques ont le meme probleme - conduit a la perte des sels mineraux utiles aux os - le calcium-  ou le magnesium; le potassium et le sodium, si utiles a nos muscles dont le coeur ... bref on meurt a petit feu. dur de se voir et en prendre conscience. Ce qui me rend malade, ce sont les courant pro-anorexie que l'on trouve sur internet. Ceci me repugne, parce que le corps humain n'est pas beau dans cet etat, et parce que c'est conduire lentement les gens, et quasiment a tous les coups les jeunes filles, vers leur mort.<br>  Comme je le disais plus haut, on ne s'en sort jamais completement. On se voit quand meme toujours a travers les yeux des autres et on a besoin de soutien, meme lorsqu'on est ... soigne(e). Un petit coup de stress et hop ... la tendance reprend. Donc il faut avoir du courage et lutter, meme si on n'y pense plus tous les jours...|`|1900624bef57d494831dc7b512856affaa	Faut consulter parceque l'anorexie est une maladie grave et qu'il ne faut pas la négliger.|`|8e07156a4a031d7f3aca1f59822bd70daa	c'est un réel problème de santé, les sites pro ana font peur et doivent être censurés|`|f1bff29a4ee84b82aa97b766d66acca8aa	Kaboum rien penser, seulement triste voir fils ami mourir de ?a.|`|005d61feaf99951106bdcfdd25333defaa	L’anorexie survient fréquemment à la suite d’un régime amaigrissant, pas forcément justifié sur le plan médical. Le culte excessif de la minceur conduit les jeunes filles à se préoccuper de plus en plus t?t de leur poids. Toutefois, le sympt?me pondéral traduit une souffrance psychologique, bien souvent ignorée par l’entourage. L’anorexie mentale peut résulter d’un manque de confiance en soi et d’autonomie. Lorsque l’on ressent une carence affective, l’anorexie permet de se faire remarquer. Ce trouble intervient souvent peu après la puberté, lors de profonds bouleversements : il constitue un "compromis" lorsque poussée de croissance, maturation sexuelle, et passage vers le statut d’adulte sont mentalement ingérables.<br>  <br>  Les personnes anorexiques ne visualisent pas leur réelle image corporelle, elles se trouvent toujours trop grosses et ont peur de prendre du poids. La maigreur se définit par un indice de masse corporelle (rapport du poids sur la taille au carré) inférieur à 18. Ainsi, si l’on mesure 1,65 m, on est maigre à partir de 49 kg. Les anorexiques perdent au moins 15 % de leur poids normal. Sur le plan médical, on constate des troubles hormonaux avec très fréquemment une aménorrhée (absence des règles) chez les filles. Le comportement anorexique est fréquemment lié à une hyperactivité, physique et intellectuelle, un hyper-investissement scolaire ou professionnel, une pauvreté relationnelle, une humeur dépressive. <br>  <br>  Les troubles du comportement alimentaires sont typiquement féminins, concernant un homme pour 10 à 15 femmes. Depuis plusieurs années, l’anorexie gagne du terrain. Autrefois diagnostiquée dans des familles de classe moyenne ou élevée, elle touche désormais toutes les couches de la population. Elle frappe de plus en plus jeune, débutant le plus souvent entre 12 et 18 ans, au lieu de 15 à 25 ans. Les médecins hospitaliers, spécialisés dans les troubles du comportement alimentaire, voient même des anorexiques de 8 à 9 ans ! En France 0,5 à 1 % des adolescentes seraient anorexiques. Elles sont probablement encore plus nombreuses : déniant complètement leur maladie et leur maigreur, elles ne consultent que contraintes et forcées par l’affaiblissement physique, résultat d’un amaigrissement prolongé.<br>  <br>  Cela est une tres grave maladie si elle n'est pas soigner car ils peuvent en mourires.En plus sa ne sere a rien detre aussi mince que sa se n'est pas tres jolie.|`|594935d3da46c8524e700acfa7e786e3aa	Ce que je pense des anorexiques ?<br>  <br>  Je les plains car c'est une maladie grave qui détruit le corps et l'esprit, je leurs conseille vivement d'aller voir un spécialiste et je conseille à tous leurs proches de les mettre devant la dure réalitée : .<br>  <br>  Oui l'anorexie est une maladie, oui elle est grave, non vous n'êtes pas bien dans votre peau et oui vous risquez la mort !<br>  Pensez à vos proches qui se font un sang d'encre et qui voudraient et qui doivent vous aidez !<br>  <br>  Non aux sites pro anna qui devraient être interdits .<br>  Non aux mannequins trop maigres .<br>  <br>  Même si elle ne s'en rendent pas compte l'anorexie est une maladie et elles doivent en prendre conscience !<br>  <br>  Mangez !

ZRScOoU7aa	Yellow discharge is not normal.. you should see a doctor! Hope you're okay..|`|AA11707062	I'm not saying you have this, but you need to be checked out by your doctor, because you have some symptoms of PID..<br>  <br>  Pelvic inflammatory disease, commonly called PID, is an infection of the female reproductive organs. PID is one of the most serious complications of a sexually transmitted disease in women. PID can cause irreversible damage to the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, or other parts of the female reproductive system, and is the primary preventable cause of infertility in women.<br>  <br>  The symptoms of PID can vary, but may include the following:<br>  <br>  Dull pain or tenderness in the stomach or lower abdominal area, or pain in the right upper abdomen. <br>  Abnormal vaginal discharge that is yellow or green in color or that has an unusual odor. <br>  Irregular and/or painful periods. <br>  Painful urination. <br>  Spotting or cramping throughout the month. <br>  Chills or high fever. <br>  Nausea and vomiting. <br>  Pain during sex. <br>  <br>  There are several things which would put a woman at risk for PID, including:<br>  <br>  Women with sexually transmitted diseases -- especially gonorrhea and chlamydia -- are at greater risk for developing PID. <br>  <br>  Women who have had a prior episode of PID are at higher risk for another episode. <br>  <br>  Sexually active teenagers are more likely to develop PID than are older women. <br>  <br>  Women with many sexual partners are at greater risk for STDs and PID. <br>  <br>  Some studies suggest that douching may contribute to PID. Douching may push bacteria into the upper genital tract and may mask the discharge that could alert a woman to seek medical attention.|`|4bab62d883d3978f850d010aa2d6978aaa	It depends on many different factors. I would call your doctor. Pregnancy tests measure a level of hormone your body produces when you are pregnant.

Do you have insanely itchy welts with red edges?  I've had hives that bruise before, although not in a long time.  Could be dermatitis as someone else suggested.  Have you started using a new laundry soap or fabric softener lately?  New bath soap?  New clothes with a material that you haven't worn before?  If so, try eliminating the possibilities one at a time.  It's tempting to just cut out everything you suspect could be the cause but then you'll never figure out what is causing the problems.

7a0da3c13461a539467b5110ec103f24aa	My guess is that maybe you have a bunch of things affecting your body right now.  By that I mean that if you were just battling stress or just general fatigue or just bad diet or just PMS, then your body could probably handle it, as it usually does.  However, you are in a unique situation right now.  You are giving your body a lot of obstacles all at once.  That's tough for your body.  These factors could also be making you more susceptible to flus, colds, viruses, etc.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would really try to get some quality sleep on a regular schedule.  As much as you are craving comfort food right now, I would try to get on a regular diet of 5 small, healthy meals per day that are high in protein and relatively low in fats and carbs.  (You already know the importance of a healthy diet.)  I would also try very hard to identify a favorite, calming activity, and I would dedicate no less than 15 minutes per day to my activity.  Reducing your stress will certainly help you feel better mentally and physically.  If you are having a hard time picking an appropriate activity, could I suggest a bubble bath or meditation?<br>  <br>  Good luck on your test!

eb430530a1370b8259970b0701dde5a5aa	Muchas pueden ser las causas, pero lo importante es el estado de la sangre.<br>  Si la sangre está coagulada, significa que el sangrado se produjo en alguna parte del intestino y puede tratarse de una úlcera o de algún otro transtorno.<br>  Si el transtorno se produjera más arriba del intestino, la sangre no sería visible, pues se aglutanaría con las heces., quizá sólo lo notarías en que éstas se oscurecerían.<br>  Si el sangrado es fresco (rojo y sin coagular) se trata de una lesión, probablemente en el recto. No sólo pueden ser hemorroides, sino también condilomas o alguna infección que esté da?ando la mucosa. Una causa muy frecuente de lesiones es haber tenido sexo anal sin lubricación y dilatación adecuada, en tal caso, la herida sanará en uno dos días y no hay razón para preocuparse.<br>  <br>  Ojalá algo de lo que dije te ayude, pero si duda, debes consultar a un coloproctólogo.|`|44d63bae2c4586fc653e870319290e92aa	HEMORROIDES INTERNA, CONSULTA UN MEDICO|`|969ebe6474bf7d7a7f862f10eab01ec6aa	Las almorranas pero si no tiene, mas vale q se valla para el digestivo y que le haga una colonoscopia.

eb430530a1370b8259970b0701dde5a5aa	En general, para eliminar una cicatriz se utiliza un procedimiento quirúrgico. Sin embargo, todo depende de tu tipo de piel. Si tu piel es de esas que se marcan con facilidad y a las que muy dificilemente se les borra una cicatriz con el tiempo, incluso la cirugía dejara una marca visible.<br>  <br>  Lo unico que se puede recomendar para reducir la intensidad de una cicatriz es que la frotes de diez a veinte minutos con crema todos los días. Usa la crema que quieras, puede ser una que se sienta bien en tu piel, una que huela bien o simplemente el tarro que ya había: no importa. Lo importante es que frotes la cxicatriz por un tiempo: eso es lo que reduce la cicatriz, no la crema en sí.|`|46299ded4e7bf5613399434bace43a67aa	para borrar cicatrices, creo que existe la crema "concha de nacar", que aseguran borra cicatrices y la baba de caracol... si son una de dos o las dos, pero te aconsejo que si las compras, lo hagas en un lugar seguro y de total seguridad.|`|AqM58DEgaa	baba de caracol|`|395bf9a19fb0ea4cf1f639f23676bcd8aa	hay una crema de baba de caracol muy buena, es muy cara (80euros) pero muy eficaz. y tambien en tratamentos asociados puedes utilizar unos adesivos que no son muy caros e son muy buenos.|`|5009870e1bd9439cc06212c044254398aa	<a href="http://www.botanical-online.com/medicinalsremedioscicatrices.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.botanical-online.com/medicina...</a><br>  el aloe vera es muy buena, espero te ayude algunos de estos remedios|`|B9EyvtL5aa	El aceite de rosa mosqueta es bastante efectivo. tambien, si tienes mas recursos y menos prejuicios, el aceite humano es excelente...pero a mi me da un poquito de cosa....|`|ddda5f1dab2e211e28aa17cff083c302aa	Si tienes dinero compra Cicatricure.... si no, con crema de concha nácar, la venden en las boticas y farmacias del centro... solo que cuando la uses... no te expongas al sol, póntela más bien de noche.|`|224f8b0b2194103e4c5231e6828918ccaa	Consigue cancha de nacar eso no las borra del todo pero si las mejora y aclara|`|5bc558841bd6730e8dbff51fc9ffaba7aa	Con cebo de vela o rosa mosqueta, se desaparece por completo.|`|RT1T9eZaaa	cuando yo era peque?a me ponián crema de conchas de nacar el las cicatrices que se me formaban cuando tenia una quemadura o me daba algun golpe y me quedaba cicatris por que se me habria la piel,por lo menos las ha disminuido|`|bedfabd5b1ab1a8c1b1af8d6e8051f89aa	por experiencia t recomiendo el Cicatricure<br>  <br>  en verdad sirve<br>  <br>  ya que a mi me dieron un botellazo en la mejilla derecha por lo cual la herida era de como 7 cms. y me decian que solo con cirujia se me borraria, pero no fue asi ya que use el cicatricure y en verdad borro toda evidencia de dicha herida|`|lgPoIKg0aa	con un borrador|`|sDZZUm80aa	Consulta a un dermatologo. Si tu cicatriz es queloide (abultada) existe un producto que se inyecta directamente en la cicatriz en varias sesiones. Para otro tipo de cicatrices se aplica peeling y/o microdermoabrasiòn. Es algo relativamente economico.

Some examples:  asparagus, broccoli, carrots, celery, green beans, apples, mangoes, oranges, spinach, papaya.|`|HnX0kkTZaa	drink more water...it's help craving and reduce hunger... good luck...|`|43566b65215dadc07c8f9555c12da75aaa	I love dill pickles. And like the other poster said. negative calorie foods are great. like cucumber, carrots, beets. But don't be confused by some who say fruits like apples and mangos. they are full of sugar.<br>  <br>  Negative calorie foods also have calories but the energy it takes your body to process the food burns more calories than what they have in them. so eat up.<br>  <br>  google negative calorie foods for the complete list.

This diet is destine to fail because you can't stop eating forever.  When you don't eat for more then 10 hours while you are awake and active, your body goes into survival mode and burns fat and calories WAY more slowly than normal.  So, on day 11 when you can eat again, almost every calorie that you take in will be stored as fat, bacause you will have convinced your body that food is in short supply and you are starving.  Good luck.|`|VHnVBZhVaa	This is definitely not a safe idea.  A diet like this could throw your electrolytes seriously off balance.  You should be consuming at least juice.|`|289cf802dd9e184db10089afc9d29eaaaa	Your going to really throw off your body... I don't think you should go on the diet. But, it's your body and your choice.

054aa59e6412961caa59c4b6674bcee0aa	you need more exercise than two hours a week. you should be doing at minimum 30 minutes a day.|`|AA10774713	Yes you can lose that much weight with no exercise and that meal plan but I don't recommend it because it looks like it's way too few calories.  You don't want to starve yourself because that will actually slow down your metabolism, which will make it even harder to lose weight.  Is that your meal plan for one meal and you plan to eat it 3 times a day or is that just what you plan to eat throughout the day only once?<br>  <br>  I suggest you eat other foods too.  Don't limit yourself to just those foods.  It's important to have variety in order to get all the important nutrients in your body that other foods may have that you're not getting.  Also, by looking at your meal plan, where is your source of protein and fat?  You need to eat carbohydrates, fat (unsaturated), and protein (such as lean meats or legumes).  I need to get to bed now but email me and I can explain more if you'd like.|`|IhVbHSYDaa	Try a cleansing diet!  I did and lost 11 pounds and 21 inches in only 9 days.  I was very happy with the results and continued on the program and lost 29 pounds in 5 weeks.  This is the fastest I have ever lost with other diets like Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast, Slimfast etc…. Cleansing works by removing impurities from your body.  You get impurities from your food (pesticides, preservatives, food additives, colorings) water, chemicals, pollution, medications, alcohol, hormones that the animals you eat were fed etc….YUCK!  The impurites get coated with fat and remain in your body.  To remove the fat, you have to remove the impurites.  This system worked for me, maybe it can work for you too.  You can check out the website or call this toll free number 1-877-587-4647 for more info.  The program is not cheap, but it is worth every penny since it works and keeps you motivated.  Good luck!

Think of Oprah with the Optifast diet or Beyonce doing Master Cleanse both gained it back.  These types of starvation diets are a temporary fix, but when you reintroduce food you gain very quickly.|`|953c3e038cdffbc91a6cbb23515d2ae5aa	im scared 4 u .u need 2 eat.|`|vurN9Wsjaa	ya it may work!<br>  <br>  or try my steps:<br>  <br>  To loose weight:<br>  <br>  1.

Be happy. Surround yourself with people who support you or motivate you. Also try to take a moment and smell fresh air when you feel that anger. Getting along is MUCH easier than fighting. Anger makes you hurt.
