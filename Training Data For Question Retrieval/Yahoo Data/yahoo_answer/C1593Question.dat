20090219210412AA4EzPZ	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	How has Japan got away with it?	During WW2 Its estimated that Japan killed anywhere from 10-30million chinese civilians, some argue even more. They had germ warfare research camps all through china including Unit 731 where they tested on and killed hundreds of thousand of civilians.       Then you've got their POW camps. In a German POW camp you had a 2% chance of death and you were generally treated ok. In a japanese one you had a 25% chance of death and you would be used as slave labour, tortured and starved to death.      Japan killed more civilians than the Germans did in the holocaust yet you never hear about it. Germany only recently finished paying of their reparation and Japan a refusing to pay anything to these chinese civilians.       They don't teach there people an accurate history of this either, where as Germany are fully aware and apologetic about what happened.      I'm not trying to rant here but this just p*sses me off. I honestly would like to know how they got away with this      Also just to preempt some responses I'm sure I'll get. This is not racial, I have nothing against japanese people, only the japanese government

20090219220819AAoWwhq	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	Philippines: Cebuanos, what's your secret for a happy pig?	Accdg. to Anthony Bourdain:      "What we did get right, I'm quite sure, was making sure that the amazing, porky delights of "sisig" got plenty of camera time. If you've never had this divine mosaic of pig parts, chopped and served sizzling and crisp on one side on a screaming hot platter, then you've yet to have one of the world's best beer drinking dishes. And speaking of pig? It can now be said that of all the whole roasted pigs I've had all over the world, the slow roasted lechon I had on Cebu was the best. This puts the standings in the Hierarchy of Pork as follows:      #1. Philippines      #2. Bali      #3. Puerto Rico      If nothing else, I hope that homesick Filipinos living abroad get a glimpse of some of the food and scenery they've no doubt been missing. And for viewers who weren't previously familiar with the wide and tasty spectrum of flavors available over there, I hope the sight of me shoving a lot of very tasty stuff into my maw provides -- if nothing else -- inspiration to look further."       http://anthony-bourdain-blog.travelchann...

All the seasonal jobs seem to be for 18 year-olds in a ski-fields and leave no room for actually travelling the country.

20090203111541AA4wclS	Travel;United States;Washington, D.C.	Why doesn't it snow in Washington DC?	Seriously.  I don't mean a "sprinkling" or a trace of snowfall. Proper snow in which you can make a snowman.  It just does not seem to snow at all. Invariably, weather forecasts for snow end up being rain/sleet, or the storm misses entirely.  What I find most strange about this is:      1. It is not like it does not get cold in Washington D.C..  There's plenty of 34 degrees and under days.  So it is not a question of it being too warm.      2. I have lived here since 1996.  Up until about 2003, there used to be several snowstorms per winter, with proper snowfall.      3. It does snow in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, West Virginia.  What is it about Washington DC, that the snow *always* misses it?%
20090203111600AARstIU	Travel;Latin America;Other - Latin America	Which Latin American country should I visit?	I've been to Costa Rica and Mexico. In CR I visited Tamarindo, San Jose, and Arenal area. In Mexico I visited Cancun. Cancun by far had the most beautiful beaches and although I had a great trip and that I am Mexican I love Costa Rica by far. I think its because I want to experience culture and be surrounded by Spanish speaking people. In Cancun it was very touristy and locals did not mingle so much with tourists.  In Costa Rica locals and tourists would go to the same night club and eat in the same restaurants. I'm not saying that nobody did the same in Cancun but just the atmosphere was completely different. I enjoyed going to a club in CR and listening to both English and Spanish music. Maybe Cancun wasn't the place for me.       Sooooo what I am looking for is another latin country I can visit where I am able to experience another culture, but at the same time enjoy the beaches, night life, entertainment (shows, sports), dancing, nature. Where its not so many resorts.      Any help?

20090219214916AAs75Eg	Travel;France;Paris	What would I wear in London and Paris mid March?	I'm 20 years old and going with a friend to London and then to Paris March 13-20th this year. I don't know what the weather is going to be like, because it's not exactly winter, but it's also not warm enough to be spring like (I don't think). So I'm not sure how cold it's going to be. We're going to be sightseeing and shopping during the day, and going to bars/nightclubs in the evening. Advice for what to wear? I know not to wear sneakers or sweatpants, but what would be stylish in these cities, yet comfortable? I bought a pair of knee high flat black boots to walk around in during the day, is this ok? And what do I wear in the nighttime?! I don't want to wear high heels. Please help with shoe and clothes advice!

20090219223113AA5SP3Y	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	Did Nancy Palosi check Priceline before she went to Italy?	Here we go again. I'm not going to bash her or insult her which is my usual modus operandi. This time I'm giving her the total benefit of the doubt. I presume you have been watching CNN who is commenting on her trip to Italy and the cost to taxpayers. Let's get beyond that for a moment. The point is that she and her cohorts took a private jet which, according to CNN, costs $10,000 an hour to operate. They also said that the total trip costs $200,000.00 but they can't confirm that yet.   So I went to Priceline and checked four(4) round trip tickets from KSFO to Rome, Italy. I also gave her the benefit of first class arrangement over business class. So, sombody please help me out. Here's what I got in what should be a comfortable scenario for her:         http://www.priceline.com/travel/airlines...        Is that price include the total for four tickets like I asked? If you look to the right, it sure seems to. Both American and United Airlines seem to pretty much have the same offer. Even if you did multiply that by four, it's still well, well over $100,000.00 of savings over what she pulled off. Ok, wait a minute. I'll do the math and say around $51 or 2K and throw in the hotel for 4 grand? The total would have to be less than $60,000; please. You can go to any travel agency and do better than what she just did.
