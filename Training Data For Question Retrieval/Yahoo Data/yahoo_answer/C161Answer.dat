8WbfmK5daa	Anson James.<br>  <br>  I love James definitely think you should have that as the middle name lol|`|AA11138222	I think Anson William would be nice.

dRKGXQmeaa	My son mauled my breasts within his first week. I was bleeding and bruised on both nipples, and even the nurses were surprised and felt badly for me. I cried about 6 times just because of breastfeeding going badly in the first week, but now me and my little guy are just fine Is there a lactation consultant she can speak to at the hospital? The trick is to wait until his mouth is gaping open and then whip him on there as fast as possible, and hold him in position while he starts sucking. His lips need to be flanged out and his chin pressed in, nose sitting on top. Unfortunately now that her nipples are already damaged it will continue to be painful for a few days even if she does get a correct latch. In the meantime lansinoh brand lanolin will help - it's like a wax that you can put on nipples and moist wounds that helps them heal without scabbing. I think this is the main reason women stop trying to breastfeed, but it DOES stop happening. Soon enough the baby will learn that if he sucks a certain way he'll get more milk, therefore be full and happy faster and easier than with biting. It's a learning experience for both mom and baby and it can be frustrating for both but there is an end in sight. If she needs a break to heal up, and is ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE, get her to pump some milk and bottle feed him for a feeding or two to let herself recuperate. I don't recommend doing this often or unless she can't take it. I did it a few times and my little guy was unhappy switching between bottle and boob. It took time to get him used to the boob again and we're only just now able to bottle feed him without any frustration at 6 weeks. Congratulations and good luck to your daughter! :) Trust me, if she sticks with it, it will work out fine.|`|avx7bLnKaa	it is poor latch... it isn't "biting persay"<br>   when babies suck the breast the babies gums massage and press on the areola area and suck... the baby isn't latching on the areaolas she is latching on the nipple... the baby needs to take in more of the breast... mommy may need a person to help her out until the latch is good<br>  definitely needs to talk to that lactation consultant
aJLx0nhNaa	We took our baby out to dinner before that age, but months about 3 -7 aren't the best months for restaurants.  We just skipped it for those months.<br>  <br>  After that, especially if you're giving them finger foods and can get something they can gnaw on, they enjoy restaurants more and it's not such a hassle.  And my son kind of digs when he gets to eat what we're eating, even if it's just a piece of bread to play with.  It pays to go on the early side though.|`|rAkWoweOaa	My son just turned 5 months. We just got back from dinner. He did good, but we had a lot of people with us, so we kind of kept passing him around so he was happy. Last weekend we took him to chili's and I fed him before we left so he fell asleep in the car and stayed asleep at chili's and you know how loud it can be there.|`|v8YLFSR3aa	Try doing lunch time instead, we have taken our baby our to breakfast and lunch ever since he was 2 months old.  Never had a problem with it, in fact I feel lucky because I think that he got used to being at restaurants and in public that he just acts very normal now that he is 11 months, he enjoys being out.  Now, I have never tried taking him out at night, we have a sleeping routine that I have not challenged myself to break.  I could totally see my baby reacting like yours if we ever tried to break our night routine.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	We take our baby out to eat all the time. She's 3 1/2 months now. She does really well. She'll get bored after a while...so I put her in my lap and she sits there and watches everyone in the restaurant. She's an easy baby though.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I always take my daughter out when we go to dinner, I always brought food for her, and things to keep her occupied, I just made sure I was home by her bath/bed time.
phZR63Rdaa	A lot of attention has recently been given to the correlation between what a pregnant woman eats before conception and the gender of the baby she ends up having.  A recent study indicated that women who consume more daily calories (as much as about 2200) and consumed breakfast were more likely to conceive a boy.  Some women who want sons will read this and arbitrarily try to bump up their caloric intake and start making breakfast a priority.  While I applaud these efforts, you should know that in a sense this is flying blind, because the acidity of the foods are every bit as important as what you consume and when.  I'll tell you why this is true in this article and will also offer examples of the foods you should be eating (and avoiding) if you're wanting to conceive a boy.<br>  <br>  to read more go to:<br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Foods-to-Eat-to-Get-a-Baby-Boy&id=1728224" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Foods-to-Eat-t...</a>
BzCYQlcuaa	well relax. no judgment here. first i would just wait a few more days and see if your period comes. you may just be stressed from cheating and that may cause you to be late. then after if you don't get your period in a week or so i would take a home test. if you are pregnant then your doctor can tell you around the time you got pregnant. also if you count back and figure out when you ovulated you may be able to get a ruff idea of when you got pregnant. but do not cause your body all this stress just yet. the more you think and worry you will delay your period more. good luck.<br>  relax,|`|tOdjjeAmaa	You will absolutely need to get a paternity test to find out. Doctors can never tell exactly when you get pregnant. It's always an estimate based on the first day of your last period. Good luck...|`|MMF1YmZZaa	You need to look at your cycle and when you would have ovulated. A normal cycle is 28 days, day 1 is the first day of your period and then you typically ovulate on day 8-16. The egg has a life span of about 24-48 hours. Also, sperm can live in your body for up to 6 days. Now, the guy you cheated with didn't ejaculate, however he could still have "leaked" out some sperm that he and you would not have been aware of. <br>  <br>  The doctors can tell you down to the week, but not the day. If you don't know the exact day of your missed period they just guess. <br>  <br>  This is an awful situation to be in, but everyone makes mistakes. If you can't figure it out, or you think you cheated at a "dangerous" time in your cycle, then my advice would be to tell your boyfriend. If I was the same situation I couldn't bear the thought of my boyfriend and his family being excited the whole time I was pregnant and throwing me a baby shower or buying me gifts etc. Also, the stress alone would be too much for me. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about what people will say to you. You have to live with your choices and no one has the right to judge you. At this point you just need to do the right thing and tell you boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't get too stressed, things have a way of working out.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes this could be the other man's baby.<br>  <br>  this is what happens when you cheat...i really hope that you tell your boyfriend he has a right to know - he shouldnt have to pay for a baby that is not his.<br>  <br>  if you plan on marrying your bf why would you betray him?<br>  <br>  get a dna test done after the baby is born.|`|a6An96Araa	If you can cheat on your boyfriend, you are not ready to get married.<br>  Save the guy the future pain being worse, and tell him.|`|7xit1ogxaa	Well, the first thing you need to do is take a test to find out for sure. Your period could be late since you are stressed about the idea of being pregnant. If your last period was on the 22nd of January and the only time you slept with someone else was on the 14th of February then it would more than likely be your boyfriend's baby.<br>  <br>  BTW-If you really plan on marrying then you need to let him know that you cheated on him. It's not really fair to him.|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	Science has come really far and they are getting close to telling you the exact moment that you become pregnant. If you were planning on marrying your boyfriend then why did you choose to cheat?!  You will need to tell both men involved and have a paternity test when the baby is old enough<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Mi0f4Hufaa	a guy doesn't have to *** to get you pregnant. and your dr. can give you an estimated date but it is just estimated. so it really could be either guy who fathered this poor child.|`|EFGKxSsVaa	youre honestly the most pathetic girl ive ever come across. you want to marry your current boyfriend but you cheat on him??? ahaha, wow, i hope that you do get pregnant and he finds out and dumps your sorry ***. woww.|`|a7a3379686a9b62bae0a4c14b66f9b47aa	Why did yu cheat?<br>  I dun think the doctors can tell you the exact day yu got pregenant.<br>  THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDA NEVER CHEAT.|`|D35xKICoaa	You should not cheat it is wrong but it happen already. I think the baby is for the other guy good luck*****888|`|RQxPU5tOaa	if you plan on marrying him you shouldnt have cheated on him?<br>  good mistake. <br>  i hope your preggg
YFPMcHCbaa	Probably a little  bit of blood. You shouldn't really worry about it. You can still get pregnant. Take a test if you think you may be pregnant.
pO0s0bhHaa	Use the name that you both love.  I think you'll regret it if you settle for something else.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I would still use it.|`|3meIiIsmaa	Even if you had "picked it out" - but had not used it - it still gets very confusing in a family to have two people with the same name - and some resentment is bound to occur -- out of the millions of names - I'm sure you can find one more that you could use -- besides, I'd want my child to be unique in the family and not a "copy" of someone else's child that is close to her age (as opposed to being named for an older relative or using a "family" name)-- <br>  Hey - give us a try - maybe we could help --|`|57LFRfqCaa	I would still use the name - your aunt doesn't own the name.|`|95305a595de7cbc914577df5969ece1faa	i dont really see nething wrong with tht. as long as u all r ok with it thts all tht matters!|`|AA12325261	Do what you want.<br>  <br>  Why change and potentially regret it?|`|LaJn6jxJaa	depends on what the name is...

XOtOMncwaa	I started when my son was 11 1/2 months, the first day I added one ounce of milk and the rest formula, then 2 days after that I added 2 ounces of milk and so on... I continued to add an ounce of milk every 2 days until there was no more formula in the bottle. I think it's better to slowly ween them off... my son absolutely hated the taste of milk, but when I weened him off he did much better. <br>  And I know about the emotional thing, it was pretty hard to keep it together at my sons birthday party, and I was just looking through some old pics on my myspace a second ago and started crying. <br>  Lanes 13 months|`|tDZMJue9aa	around 11 months just give him some in a cup if he is using a cup or start by giving him an ounce or so in his bottle ..dont mix it...if he drinks it stop the formula all together...try something with a little taste tooo...we lived overseas (my husband is military) when we weaned our kids and they had filled milk...it tasted funny to anyone that had grew up on regular milk, but the kids liked it i guess because it was similar to formula....im thinking something like a soy milk would be similar...|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Wow, I'm sitting here TRYING to remember how we did it or even when we did it. For the life of me I can't remember. And it's only been about 14-15 months ago. LOL Mommy brain.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	My sister started getting cows milk at 11 months, I dont know the other details! <br>  <br>  Good luck. I was just on your myspace, he's getting so big!|`|IGfnrfGPaa	I started Isabelle on whole milk a day or two after she turned 1. She loves it. So glad Noah is using his sippy with out issue, Isi wants her milk in a bottle, will only drink her juice from a sippy. Can't wait until she finally gives in.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	Peyton's turning 1 in a couple weeks. I plan on adding a little cow's milk in her bottle and slowly increase it until she is completely drinking cow's milk. I'm waiting for her to feel better because the last thing I need is a sick, teething baby with a tummy ache. LOL!|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	i started izzy around 11 months w/ 2 oz. in her bottle (mixed w/ formula) and increased by 2 oz. every week. i know a lot of people who didn't do it that gradually and their kids were fine, but i wanted to take my time. she's been on whole milk for 1 week and is doing great! she'll be 1 on march 4.|`|lWUknox6aa	I actually started introducing it at 10 months.  I started doing 1/4 whole milk and the rest formula....a couple weeks later I did half milk and by 11 months she was on full cows milk and did just fine.  She had no complications or anything and prefered the whole milk over the formula.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	We waited until ours was a year old, then started replacing formula feedings with milk, until we ran out of formula one day and just didn't buy anymore.  We try to give our children only organic at this age..|`|7YoOBGMMaa	We waited until our kids turned 1 year.  I suppose there's nothing "magic" about that age, we just did since that's the "convention."<br>  <br>  I worried a little about transitioning, too, but neither of my girls had any issues.  I just switched it automatically.  (My son was on soy formula, and we also just switched him right over to soy milk).  If I had some leftover formula, I did mix it with milk, but none of our kids really had any issue with it.  We still warmed it up, though, and that was probably the more important factor for our kids.|`|heDtLdz5aa	this is how and when i started the cow's milk...at about 2-3 weeks before his first birthday i mixed in about 2oz of cows milk with 4 oz of formula..then the next week i did 3oz to 3oz..then continued until on the week of his birthday it was a full bottle of cows milk..also this may be a good time to try and trasintion him to a sippy as well..i gradually replaced bottles with sippies until he was no longer getting a bottle..by the time he was 13 months he was completely off the bottle and just taking his milk in a sippy cup...i had no problems with this and he adjusted well..|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	We started to transition him at 11 months.  Well, the plan was to transition him anyway.  We started w/ replacing his morning bottle w/ a cup of milk and were going to go from there and slowly introduce the milk.  But, within a day or so, he didn't want anything to do w/ the formula.  He loves milk and even prefers it cold.  It was much easier than w/ my oldest (in which we had to mix half and half, nor would he drink cold milk at first).  He just had his 1st birthday yesterday and has been on milk and a cup for a month and is doing great!  Good luck!  They grow way too fast!!!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I started 2 weeks before his birthday.  And I didn't really wean him, he loved it, so I just stopped the formula and gave him milk.  There wasn't really an issue.
HqOkC2YHaa	Wow, I have no idea what I would do....actually I'd be flipping out right now!!<br>  <br>  Is it possible someone was in the room that had these pictures and could taken them? Maybe it was a family member who wanted to make you a nice gift?<br>  <br>  I dunno, I hope you find them!! and now you're making me worried about my photos I should make some more back ups rather then just what's on my memory cards!!|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I would probably start freaking out too but you must have put them some place else and just not thinking of where.  Try calming down a little and stop looking for them and do something else.  Sometimes this helps to clear your head and let you figure out where you actually put the pictures.  Good luck, I hope you find them.  Unless your boyfriend is hiding them from you for some reason, I'm sure you'll find them.|`|EyKJ737daa	I would be upset too sweetie, it's precious memories and pictures that you will never get back if they get lost or destroyed, that's why. I guess men don't see things the same way we do, we love them to bits, most of them and it weren't for them, our babies wouldn't be here but honestly they could work on their sensitivity a bit I think!  I do hope you find the originals though sweetie.  All the very best.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	sit down with a hot cup of tea.<br>  take deep breaths.<br>  <br>  now try to remember the last time you saw the photos, where you were and what you were doing. remember who else knows where the photos are kept. think if there is anyone sort of dodgey who would want to steal the photos.<br>  Next... grab your mobile phone and send out a text to everyone who has been in your apartment recently asking them if they recall seeing you put the photos anywhere...<br>  <br>  since your darling son is only 4mths you are in the same hormonal state as i am in (my son is the same age) and therefore you're likely to forget things (like i am) due to the hormonal imbalances right now (it should go back to normal soon!! lol) SOMEONE should know or remember when you last had the photos and where you put them. or know if anyone else has borrowed them/put them in the wrong place.|`|qdFrJ21waa	Your boyfriend might be planning a surprise for you using the photos. I would keep your eye out but don't pressure your man too much. Or someone else in your family might be planning a surprise, like a slide show or something and asked your boyfriend to lend them the photos. Are there any special dates coming up that might warrant a surprise?|`|fh8bQdGkaa	That's horrible... I wouldn't even know what that would feel like. Anyone that you didn't really know that much been over lately? This might be a little much... but how long have you known your boyfriend? Don't read into it, but you obviously didn't move them, so someone did. Unless you misplaced them? In all of the excitement, you may have overlooked them. No one is coming clean about it... So that is a bit strange if you didn't misplace them. I really hope you find them.|`|9IGbpXtCaa	Have you had any visitors? Maybe they did something with it, or when was the last time you got it? what did you do with it?<br>  <br>  Are you sure they didn't fall from the envalope? Maybe to the floor or maybe to somewhere else, like got stuck in the a pocket or something when they fell?<br>  <br>  P.S thanks for the great idea of the scrap book picture.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i would probably throw a royal hissy fit. seriously! <br>  <br>  maybe try retracing your steps. look in every single spot you can think of. even places you know you wouldn't have moved them to. <br>  <br>  maybe your boyfriend did something with them?|`|onbwN4csaa	You know They will be in the last place you look.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  They will turn up.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	no if ands or buts someone had to have taken them|`|eeaXYyCNaa	I would probably freak too.  I also scrapbook.  That really sucks. Calm down and try looking again.  Sometimes when you are upset you can't really see/think clearly.  When you calm down you might focus better.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Just a thought, but if your boyfriend is telling you to calm down and that you are overreacting (which you're not) maybe he took them, I had my Grandmother's ring disappear once and was ready to call the cops and have them fingerprint my whole apartment, my ex got me to settle down and convinced me that I must have put it away somewhere else and it turned out he had taken it and had a stone replaced and it cleaned as a gift. Maybe your boyfriend is doing something with the pics.
oXIYHsDaaa	There is no reason to stop breast feeding if you are sick and if it is a cold or flu you will be helping your baby stay healthy by providing the antibodies to fight it off. <br>  <br>  As for the fever, you really need to go to the doctor to make sure you don't have a post operative infection from the c-section. The hospital should have told you to watch for fever. <br>  <br>  To help with the coughing you can talk to your pharmacist and see if he / she can recommend a cough syrup that is safe while you are nursing otherwise sucking on a spoonful of honey can work wonders and increase the humidity in your house by running a cool mist humidifier, using a heat exchanger on your clothes dryer or even just putting a big pot of water on the stove and let it boil. <br>  <br>  Holding a pillow against your incision when you cough will make it hurt less.|`|zwctZ812aa	Yes, you can and should keep breastfeeding when you're sick.  Your body is creating the antibodies to whatever you have and you will be passing them on to your baby.  Nurse as much as possible, just make sure you're not breathing directly in his face or anything.  I got sick with the flu when my son was almost exactly the same age.  I had a fever and chills and was throwing up, but I didn't stop breastfeeding and my son never got sick at all.  You can take meds for the cough, but if you take them, take them right after you feed your baby so they will be mostly worked through your body by the time you go to feed him again.  Hope you feel better soob!|`|AA10096832	Don't take any medication that is not specifically approved by your doctor..<br>  A c-section will not cause you to cough and have flu-like symptoms.<br>  If you just have a cold, you can definitely breastfeed. If you think there are any other problems, talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|Efa5EYJJaa	Yes you can still breastfeed unless your doctor says not to. The doctor wouldn't have given you meds that were not safe to take while brestfeeding. I took my pain meds. You can take Robitussin dm for your cough. Ask your doctor though. That is what my doctor told me that I could take.|`|lKXtfYFxaa	Yes, not only can you still breastfeed but when your body builds up an immune system against your cold it will pass along to your baby through your breast milk.  That's extremely important since he's immune system is still weak.|`|8lp47kKgaa	hi there, my baby is three month old now. i had c-section too and i had same problem as you. i couldn't cough easy because was hurting my incision. i was taking allot of pain killer (pain killer makes you easy to forget things. like i don't have very good memory now. i forget things easy) and i had fever like you but i was breath feeding too, so i didn't like to take so much medicine because medicine goes to your breath really easy so i was worry about my baby and then i just staid at home in very good Temperature and had allot of soup ( which you don't like ). then i was much better. <br>  so good luck with your new life and hope you will get better soon.<br>  time goes really fast, you will be fine soon.,
b6EyFLgUaa	My husband and I are planning on getting a will done once we have purchased our first house. We have talked with my mother and If my husband and I do pass away she gets our child(ren). She knows our values and how we want our children raised. My Father and step mother are to ill to and my MIL wouldn't listen to anything we expressed and most likely wouldn't allow my mother or my father to see her. For college we will make her a deal because my husband I legally part native American she can go to the state university for free. If her degree of choice isn't there we will help her pay for two years of college, she can go to the state college for two years and get her generals and then go any where else she wants and we will help her pay for some of it. I payed for my college and my husband paid what he had to. My moms gift to her at birth was a life insurance policy. We have put anything aside for her but I don't think its something we should do. My mother didn't for me and my husbands parents sure didn't for him. We will buy her her first car, what ever is equal to 3 grand when shes 16. It wont be a new nice car but it will run and hopefully get her through most of her college years. This is how I was raised, my husband worse. Our children will have all there needs covered and logical wants, they wont be spoiled but get things that I think a child deserves if there good kids and the parents can afford it.<br>  <br>  EDIT- Nicker I like that idea of what your parents did, I think my husband and I may put something like that in effect when our children get older, also if any one is confused by what i wrote between our daughter and children. We have a 2 year old right now and Im 2 months pregnant with our next child.<br>  <br>  EDIT- My husband was spoiled as a child from his father, computers, video games ect. until he was about 14 ( his parents are legally married but live separate lives, its very odd) he was never taught the value of a dollar or how to pay a bill. He left the house and they just expected him to know everything. We had our first child at 19 ( no she wasnt planned but shes an amazing little person) and married when she was 7 months old. I taught him everything it was scary to have a husband who didnt know that you had to pay a heat bill. He did have a car, mostly because his mom wanted a new one and went a got one and the dealer wouldn't take the car he has now. It wasn't that he didn't receive things but it was kinda of a backwards way to keep him out of there hair while he was in high school and younger so they could deal with his brother who was a rebel. They didn't take care of his needs rather just things to keep him busy. For example his brother had braces because his teeth were a bit crooked ( ive seen the photos) and there mom wanted him to have straight teeth. My husband on the other hand had a two teeth grow in sideways and they are very crooked. He never had braces nor did they really take him to the dentist or the doctors. He finally went to the eye doctor when I made him go because he couldn't see a gosh darn thing. His mother is honestly one of the most selfish, uncaring human being ive ever met. In the 10 years ive known him ive never once heard her tell her son she loves him. My mother on the other hand simply  calls him to tell her shes proud of him and loves him.  My MIL has done alot money wise for his brother ( they are half brothers) for this simple fact that he doesn't have his father in his life. Its messed up and scary.|`|rM8WrUFNaa	Well this is more on the punishment end but whenever I got into serious trouble with my parents, depending on what it was I had to pay them money. For example, I once got caught sneaking out with three 30's of beer and they sat down and figured out how much if would have cost to bail me out of jail if I had been caught by the police and also how much an MIP ticket would have cost. Lets just say I got in trouble a lot but the day I turned 18 they gave me all that money back for whatever I wanted buy with it. It was the coolest present ever. I bought a car and they paid my tution for school.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	My fiance and I both put away a bit of our money a week for our daughter. It's not much (we both only have part time jobs and have to pay rent), but we put whatever left over in there.<br>  This money is used for our yearly holiday as well as our daughter's schooling fund. My MIL is also willing to pay for a lot -- she is a life saver.<br>  We are both needing to get a will, but my fiance being my fiance doesn't think we'll need one, but I say you can never be too careful.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	My parents didn't do anything for me and my sister's futures-not a dime saved away, no bank accounts or college funds.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? When I become pregnant, and am half way through the pregnancy, I'd set up a college/university fund. I would talk it over with someone to make it work well. I would also do a well with my partner to make sure everything was right. ?¤·?|`|a9YfUGzSaa	Mine I THINK have something in their will for my sister's care (I hope), but that was all they did.  I was told I had a bank account for college money that they were putting money into, but I'm halfway done with undergrad and they haven't even mentioned it, so apparently that either didn't exist or went someplace else.  Whoops!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Apparently I was misunderstood since I got a thumbs down.  I'm just being honest, my parents really didn't do anything, and if hearing that is going to make some parents think then that's great-- that's why I said it.

You seem very intelligent.|`|p25p9jTYaa	that's your problem, you're a goodie goodie.|`|QFLtTeKEaa	Friendship isn't just about you.  Ask yourself who you would like to be friends with and why you are genuinely interested in them.  What do you offer in a friendship?  <br>  <br>  Friends do things together that they both enjoy, because they enjoy each other and then through consistency in the relationship that they build, they began to rely on each other and trust each other.  <br>  <br>  If you want a friend, just go out and be one.  Also, you sound like an intellectual, try to remember that that doesn't make you better than other people, but probably you will enjoy spending time with other intellectuals.  <br>  <br>  Join clubs and organizations.  You're a good guy, not a victim of an unfair society!  Have fun, make some fun, and people will join you.|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	Judging by the way you present your words... (you sound wise beyond years) You probably come of to other teens as an arrogant know it all . I would consider showering a bit more :) Personally, I always had friends that were a bit older than me. I never quite identified with people my age. Try taking a few classes at a local college that you are interested in. Maybe you will find more people that you identify with. So don't sweat it too much. Everyone is different.|`|KU0tnveUaa	stop acting so conceited.  you kind of have a "i'm better than most teenagers" air going on.  and just go with it - don't think about stuff too much.  unless of course it's somethign like drugs.  lol|`|NjXdkwUiaa	Ow my god you are the most boring person i have ever heard of.

I thought the day was never coming. lol. Good luck!|`|O7U1tUaJaa	by the time I had my baby I was a mess.  It seemed like it took months for those last few weeks to pass.  I finally told my doctor I wanted to be induced.  she said lets do it wed. no wait thursday.  she went to schedule it and said lets take your bp again...on second thought do you want to have your baby tonight.  then I wasn't ready for him to come out but my bp was 160/110.  when I got to the hospital it was normal and they induced me anyway.  I don't knpow to many people who think it goes by fast because you so uncomfy and you are excited to meet your baby.  It just makes it seem that much longer.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	It a way it was slow because we were so close to having our little one and meeting her and if never seemed to come but also it went too quickly.

I was petrified of the c-section - and you know when you're not looking forward to something, time flies by. Excited to have the baby though.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	They went by slow.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? Kids should be grounded for the length of time fit for the punishment. It's teaching them for them they are older. It's like going to prison, only much easier. Restricting tv is good. Kids are way to wrapped up in it anyways and should seek other ways of entertainment. <br>  <br>  So what about that 15 year old losing his summer vacation, they should of thought about the consequences first. <br>  <br>  Kids need to know there is consequences for everything, and just because its the summer or their birthday, they need to know the punishment will effect them whenever it is hit. They can just be let off the hook to be free, that won't teach them anything.<br>  <br>  I definitely agree you shouldn't had kids. Your kids would walk all over you. ?¤·?|`|a9YfUGzSaa	My sister's been grounded for a year and a half.  She won't be ungrounded until she proves she's trustworthy, and she manages to continue getting in trouble even though she's grounded.  So for her grounding is to keep her safe, and she gets additional punishments as well to correct her behavior.  She's 16 years old, she's plenty old enough to know better than to do the crap she's doing.  If she wanted to be ungrounded she'd stop.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	I think that any amount of grounding can be reasonable, depending on the offense. Restricting television can be a great means of punishment if the kid is too reliant on TV for entertainment, and it distracts them from more important priorities, like homework and family. I experienced a few 'long groundings' when I was younger and it did not stir up resentment toward my parents. It made me respect them MORE. The only kids that would grow to hate their parents for effectively disciplining them are whiney little brats who should have been disciplined sooner.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You can ground them for as long as you need to. A TV is for company? If you are going to have kids it is your job to parent them and to punish them. If they do something to merit taking away their summer vacation so be it. They need to learn that there are consequences for their actions.|`|5TTZCXMxaa	i reckon its bull c r a p|`|h1lDGNp4aa	I think it depends upon the offense plus taking into account just how often the child/teen disobeys.  <br>  <br>  I see nothing wrong with taking away TV privileges for a year!  Maybe the teen will actually spend some time reading! or interacting with others.  <br>  <br>  I bet that 17 yr old who was grounded 4 mos for being 4 hrs over curfew did a whole lot of things he shouldn't have done & it was just the icing on the cake.<br>  <br>  I can see that the teen would become resentful but I'm also thinking that it would be nice if the teen realized that actions have consequences and that he needs to change his attitude and behavior to avoid spending months at a time being grounded.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest that the teen approach his parents and say, Let's sit down.  Discuss our problems.  What do you want.  Here's what I want. Let's see if we can come to some agreements that would make all of us happy.  Calm, reasonable family pow-wows usually work but it is important to remain calm.  Think this over.  Wait a few days.  Use your time to write things out.  And then ask your parents for a meeting.  Good luck.
4WJM3j9Aaa	no formula feeding is just as good...try it
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? Uh, you do know that just because you turn 18 doesn't make you automatically free. You can move out at 16, but your parents can stop you. My sister moved out at 17 cause the family broke up and she refused to live with her dad. She rented out a room for $400 a month. On top of that, if you really want out at 18, you need to start working for it now. At the age of 16, I started working and saving. I bought kitchen supplies, bathroom items, I even made a budget page to help me. When you move out, you need to take into account the cost for the moving van, the hook up fees, the first and last month rent, and so on. The world is very expensive, and there is no chance I could afford to live by myself. A person needs two incomes to be able to afford to live. Just start planning now. <br>  <br>  Regarding your family, no. They would be your kids, and they would only be able to if they proved you to be unable to raise your kids. Plus, I doubt they'd want to spend the money to try. ?¤·?|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	That's a loaded question. Legally at 18 you are free from your parents. BUT, if they are supplying you with money, a home, a car, or anything else, you pretty much are still under their thumb because they can take away you're "privileges" if you will. It's either be a grown up (meaning doing stuff without mommy or daddy) or deal with their opinions and interference.<br>  <br>  Edit: If it was all in your name, no they legally couldn't be involved. But if you need them to do things like supply car insurance (money) or gas, again, the car is yours but it's not moving if it's on E or uninsured.|`|jUKEqDmwaa	yes when your 18 your FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE|`|XYT7jvBdaa	If you ever had kids, your parents are not given visitation 'rights'. You can forbid them from seeing their grandchildren. <br>  <br>  I am 18 years old and I am not free from my parents. If you use anything they provide for you such as a house or a car, then you are not free of them and you are still obligated to pay some mind to what they say and what rules they establish. Your dad providing you a home means that you need to abide by the rules he has set for that home. Your dad getting you a car means that you are obligated to follow any conditions he sets for you to obtain and keep the car. And honestly, as long as you are living under a roof that he is paying for, he does reserve the right to have some input about who you're with, who you date and where you go.<br>  <br>  One is only free from their parents when they are financially and otherwise independent from them. You won't be by having him buy you a car and provide you housing.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	If you're letting your dad provide housing for you, it seems to me you don't really want to be totally free.  As long as he has that to hold over your head, no, you are not free.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you asked.  My dad lets me drive his car, I never asked, it was just offered to be because he doesn't use it.  But guess what?  He gets to choose where I am allowed to go, for how long, and give me a curfew if I'm driving-- and I'm 20.  Until you are COMPLETELY supporting yourself, they will find power over you if they want it.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	When your 18 yes you are free. You could leave and never talk to your parents again if thats what you wanted. If your dad got you a car and it was in our name free and out then yep its yours and considered a gift. If he wants to pay for housing be careful becomes he could stop and you wouldn't have a house. If you have children no they dont have any rights to those kids they are your children not theirs. The only thing you may need is if you get FASFA you need your parents tax information other then that there isnt much I can think of.|`|5CZKewO7aa	based on ur description of ur parents, i can only imagine on how you feel. i think the biggest issue is the money. since they do supply you with money, they may feel that you owe it to them for them to be able to contact you often. but yeah, if u got the money, run away, and pay for ur own phone line. so good luck until ur 18|`|ZFE4Z00Haa	My mom and dad both had wonderful parents. But right after they marries, they didn't take ANY money or housing or anything at all from their parents.<br>  <br>  Now that's independence, and until you have a job, no, you are not free.
OLW0Irbhaa	Your doctor will need to make that recommendation based on your babies needs.  <br>  <br>  You might be surprised that once you've been breastfeeding you won't want to give it up.  The benefits to you and the baby are amazing.  And even if you are going back to work you can still breastfeed completely or offer formula during the day if you can't pump at work and then breastfeed once you are home with baby.|`|AA10096832	I ended up with Similac Organic and was very happy with it. But your baby may end up needing a different formula (soy-based or whatever). Start with the organic milk-based, though. If there is a problem (and you will know), talk to your doctor and she/he will help you to consider other types. <br>  <br>  Hopefully breastfeeding will work for you. And if it does, definitely try to pump for as long as you can. Rent a good breastpump. It'll be a LOT cheaper than formula (and breastmilk is really good for your baby but of course you already know that). <br>  <br>  I've had friends who say the key is to get pumping after a few weeks (wait until after you've established your milk supply and your baby is used to breastfeeding) and start getting your baby to take a bottle periodically at about 5 weeks. If you wait too long, it could be very challenging. I've had a few friends who had a lot of trouble trying to introduce the bottle later and that made going back to work much more stressful for them. Just an FYI and good luck! :)|`|u94HOVz7aa	all formula is fda regulated and must meet nutritional requirement.  the biggest difference is milk based, soy based, lactose free aka sensitive formula, and special needs formula.  each child is different and require different formula. most babies can be on the regular  milk based formula.  so that is probably where you should start then go from there as your pediatrician recommends.  as for brands my son's pediatrician said there are such minimal differences between them it doesn't matter enfamil over similac or store brand.  hope this was helpful.  congratulations!|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I did the same as telltell 98. I used what they had given me at the hospital which then led to a milk allergy and then tryed out similac lactose free and stuck with it...<br>  <br>  It may take a couple to find the right one|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Ask your doctor.  He can make a good recommendation.  I used Nestle Goodstart Supreme.  It worked really well for my baby.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Good Start, I love this one. worked for all my kids and my friends kids. Its great|`|VpcT7dUgaa	It's wonderful to hear that you're going to give your baby the best start in life by breastfeeding. I don't know why any knowledgeable mother would even consider formula unless it was a life-or-death scenario.<br>  Especially after formula in the US was found to be contaminated with melamine recently. The companies that manufacture formula do NOT have your baby's health in mind when they make the formula. They have their PROFITS in mind.<br>  <br>  The key to successful breastfeeding is to be stubbornly committed to it. Do not allow anyone at the hospital to give your baby a bottle under any circumstances. Demand to nurse immediately after the baby is born - all their procedures (which you don't have to have - Vitamin K shot, antibiotics in the eyes, bathing, Hep B vaccine etc) can wait until after you've had a chance to nurse.<br>  <br>  We drew up a birth plan - we said that if I had a c-section and the baby had to go to the nursery for any reason, that dad would go with baby to make sure nothing was done without our consent. We said no to antibiotics in the eyes because I don't have venereal disease. We said no to Hep B because babies don't have sex or share needles with drug users. We said we would give the baby his first bath when I felt up to it. We said no to Vit K injection, though we would have given oral Vit K if it had been available.<br>  <br>  Just remember, you're the only person in the world who can advocate for your baby. To the doctors and the hospital, your baby's just a number and they treat them all the same instead of considering what's really best for each baby.<br>  <br>  Learn all you can about breastfeeding and make sure your partner is totally supportive so that when others start pushing formula your partner can protect you and your baby. Believe in yourself. It's not always easy in the beginning, but it is so worth it. Trust that your baby and your body can figure this out - together : )<br>  There will be times when you start to question your body's ability to feed your baby. My answer to this was not to allow any formula in our home. Then when I had moments of doubt I couldn't easily give formula. The answer to almost any nursing concern is . . . relax and nurse more! You won't just be giving your baby the best possible food - you'll be giving your baby comfort, security, and connection. <br>  <br>  I didn't nurse my first born but I did nurse my second, third and fourth child and not nursing my eldest is one of my biggest regrets in life. The experience of nursing is profoundly beautiful. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your precious baby. Remember, if you start giving formula it's easy to undermine the supply and demand balance that successful nursing requires. The best formula to give a baby is no formula.|`|6VR19YQWaa	Of course, breastmilk is ALWAYS best. However, should you decide to use formula, there is no benefit in paying double the cost for "brand" name formula. All formula is regulated by the FDA and is all nutritionally equal. Those with DHA and ARA could be better since it supplies things that breastmilk has. However, all generic brands also offer these benefits as well. All generic formula's are produced by the same company, PBM. So there is no difference in say , Wal-Mart vs. K-mart, vs Walgreens, etc. They all are EXACTLY the same from the same recipe.|`|O7U1tUaJaa	I use parents choice(walmart brand).  It cost way less and it has the exact same benefits as emfimil lipil.  I do know that where I live doctors recommend  enfamil lipil and that is the only brand you can get if you are on WIC because they believe that it is best for the baby.  with the brand I use you get the large can that normal cost $25 in the name brand for 11.88.|`|G766dQjtaa	I like the good start. That was the only one my son liked and it was easiest on him tummy. That would probably be the one I use this time around as well.|`|47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	I just went with what the hospital used, Goodstart Supreme.

KU0tnveUaa	only an idiot plans for marriage.  how can marrying someone be a goal in life?<br>  <br>  I don't think it's weird though - I asked a poll and almost everyone (out of 50 answers) said they aren't planning of marriage or don't plan to get married.|`|Ms8vNPD4aa	ok|`|LmD5DDWlaa	Hey there Shorts…So to plan or not to plan for the marriage. I personally see it as a three part event, the planning before hand, like the where, when, and how it will happen. The girls generally get up for that part, the perfect sunny day, the beautiful flowers, the dresses and so forth, the planning up to the event. Then there is the big event day captured in photographs with family and friends, china, crystal, flowers, the children, and everything else, to make that day perfect. But it is that third part that is the important thing, the part where you look ahead as far as planning the future, where do you want to be in a year, and in ten years from now. Did you plan for children, the medical costs, the insurances, job layoffs, or even how you might feel five years from the wedding day. This is the point, you can’t really say how you will feel five or ten years in the future, but you can plan for the possibilities. To get married means you are signing a legal contract with another human being, for better or for worse, you are responsible for there actions as in how they handle credit and even their personal actions. And unless you plan only to be married to them for just a couple years, you are stuck with them until that legal contract is dissolved. So to answer your question, the planning for the event and the event it’s self is minor in comparison to your head on straight after you enter in to the contract. Most people only plan up front and think the rest will take care of it’s self and the rest is life, so  then the marriage doesn't last.|`|r39EDGhPaa	I don't want to get married or have kids.  People think it's weird, but it's all good (;<br>  But I think it was dumb for you to argue over whether you should wait until marriage or not.  You may not think so, but other people do, respect that.<br>  <br>  edit: So why do you tell everyone that you're sexually active?  If you don't want criticism from religious people, don't be so openly sexual.  It's simple.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I think that’s silly one cant truly plan for their wedding until they have meet the man / woman they want to marry and become engaged.   How can one truly plan a wedding before they are even engaged or have meet their future husband/wife.<br>  <br>  As far as sex before marriage that is a personnel decision that everyone has to come too. If one does not really see themselves getting married then that can’t really apply to them.<br>  <br>  For some reasons people seem to think that people have to get married and have children. That is old time thinking however when a women had to get married and bare children. A man had to reproduce to carry on the family name/pass down the family land/money etc. Women didn’t have many job opportunities besides Lady of the house and mother.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	1. You need to respect that others are not going to harbor the same beliefs as you. With something as subjective as the concept of waiting until marriage, you can't really argue about it without being offensive because it is honestly that personal of a decision, as it effects nobody else. <br>  <br>  2. Honestly, i think that it is normal to not plan for marriage. I am almost 19 years old, been with my boyfriend for three years, and marriage is the furthest thing from our minds. We don't even want to get married, ever. More and more women are choosing other things over a marriage, and that's perfectly OK.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Funny story around this point:<br>  <br>  A button had fallen off my shirt and I didn't know how to sew it back on. (Yes this is relative to this believe it or not)<br>  <br>  "dad" - Kirsty! I can't believe this. You can't sew on a button lol What are you going to do when you get married?<br>  <br>  Kirsty - "What if I don't want to get married?"<br>  <br>  Dad - "Touche.."<br>  <br>  Point being everyone has different ideas about these things.<br>  <br>  It is not not normal. Everyone has their own opinions. I don't think you are missing someone, I couldnt really care if I get married or not.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Nope, I'm the same way.<br>  <br>  It's better to be independent anyways than to depend on a man to provide you with things. <br>  <br>  When you're young, you don't need to plan on anything like kids or marriage. Maybe schooling and possibly where you're going to live after high school, but teens don't need to plan marriage.<br>  <br>  That's kind of crazy, don't worry =)|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Well i did not plan my marriage as a teen. People dont know if they will fall in love. I guess it is weird for others to hear teen girls say this because we r suppose to dream of that day an plan it out lol. Well i was lucky an found my Mr right. Yes we did get married. I did not wait to find mr right he found me :)
SoppI6A3aa	well i have the same problem ur ot pregnant /make sure its not a miscarriage go to doc. most likely they will say stress,or wait til its over and get pap. how ever good luck girl u will be alright|`|2zC1lpfVaa	You may have a threatened miscarriage, but this is just a guess.  There may be other reasons for you strange bleeding, so better check with your doctor.
jhBRNvIxaa	Your cervix will feel soft anyways you have to know what the dialations are to figure out how far you are. Like a fingertip is 1 cm and so on it is a very tricky system and you should leave it up to your doc. you don't want to strip your membranes on accident.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	DONT check your cervix while your pregnant!!!!!!!  Bad idea you don't want germs to enter your vagina.  Your cervix is also very sensitive while pregnant.  You need to leave this up to a trained professional.  I understand if you have PTSD from a traumatic event in your life, but when your pregnant you have to let people check you.  Its for the health of your baby.  When your in labor they will check you every hour or so.  You have to think of your baby now too.  You don't want to go home dilated and have your baby at home!  Good Luck.|`|5f6XnInEaa	I think someone with a medical degree should be checking your cervix, you have no idea what you are looking, or feeling for.<br>  <br>  You have your child's heath to think about, and quite frankly, the PTSD is a cop out, and is certainly no justification for risking a child's health.|`|eHTbY6lhaa	i've never heard of being able to check u're own cervix. i am 22 weeks prego with my third child and have never checked my own cervix. i assume that u  yourself would not be able to get deep enough inside to feel u're own cervix. my advice to u would be to suck it up and let a doctor check u if u are that concerned about it

OBPL49vWaa	yes you can still get pregnant|`|94kNwMPdaa	you can get pregnant no matter how "deep" it was.<br>  if it was in contact with your vagina your at risk<br>  even if you ejaculated outside. they still swim and they can run down your vulva and into your vaginal opening<br>  <br>  if you dont want a baby use protection or dont have sex at all simple as that.
H20Qz1Tvaa	Losing your mucus plug doesn't mean you're in labor. I lost mine two weeks before my daughter was born.<br>  <br>  But as someone else said, BH contractions don't hurt, so they are probably real contractions.<br>  <br>  The whole day before I had my daughter, I had a terrible pressure in my pelvis, felt like she was trying to kick her way out. I guess those were my contractions, I didn't really know what they were.<br>  <br>  As others said, it wouldn't hurt to go to Labor and Delivery and have them check you out. Just say you're having contractions.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That snot is your mucus plug, often you loose it roughly 24 hours before going into labor.<br>  <br>  You don't want to break your water until the infant is almost here, until then it protects them from getting an infection and once it's broken you have 24 hours to deliver or you are given a c-section.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Wow, delivery is on the brink. I'd say you're in labor, cause that sounds EXACTLY like my labor!|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Honey, the snot, was your plug, and once you loose that, she's coming! I had my daughter in 6 hours, full labor. My water never broke, they broke it for me, and sometimes your water won't break. More than likely they aren't BH If you can't talk through them, they are real contractions and trust me, I was ready to kick down a wall once I got to the hospital, when you know you know.|`|PGiOSIBkaa	Sounds like your baby is coming.  Either call your doc or go to the hospital and find out.|`|HOdblqIkaa	that snot looking glob could very well be your mucus plug. if you are worried call your dr and talk to him or her and see what they say. or you could go to the hospital and get checked and see how things are going, they will probably send you home and tell you when to come back but its better then not knowing right? if you are really concerned i would say going to the hospital and getting checked is your best bet and if you dont feel comfortable going home, just stay and hang out there so youre already there when she comes.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	It might not hurt for you to go to the hospital and tell them you think your in labor. If you are dilated to 4 you could have your baby before you can get to the hospital. Better to be safe . I went from 4 to 10 in under a minute.|`|4WZMto1oaa	it sounds like your mucus blug came out so i think you should contact your doctor and tell him you are on your way to the hospital thats what happened to me with my oldest son my mucus plug came out when i was in the shower i went to see my doctor and she told me go straight to the hospital later that day my son was born|`|4hzUOmEOaa	Hello I say you will have her by tomorrow night.. the snot was your mucus plug. probably. and the bowel movement feeling wont go away. as long as you ae having contractions.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	Your looseing your mucus plug, Sounds like labor is VERY CLOSE! If you feel really bad i would say go into the hospital, they might turn you away if your not in active labor which is contractions 3-4 min apart. Best luck|`|VB3hbmkYaa	it sounds like you lost you mucuss however you spell that plug it isn't too important unless your water has proke and the babies head has already lodged in your pelvic opening and stopped the flow of water so you don't think it has broke but it has or you could go in labor and have to have you water broke for you it is hard to tell but you should get a doctors opinion only because if your water has broke you have a twenty four hour window before infection could set in.   get checked by a doctor to make sure a life is to precious to leave to this web site good luck and congratulations!!!!
AOvtRBU9aa	come over my house and take care of my sick and teething baby. you will get over wanting a baby in no time.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	The one thing that hit me hard, was the sleep deprivation.  Plus besides just being dead tired, how this can really mess with you, and be a huge part of depression, and also a drain on a relationship, if both parents feel the other isnt pitching in.<br>  <br>  What you could honestly do, is just keep waking yourself up a couple times a night, staying up 15-30 minutes.  Not watching tv or reading, but acting like you are feeding a baby.  Then trying to function like normal during the day. Do this for 4 months straight, and then see where you are at.<br>  <br>  Also if you are really eco friendly, waiting a couple years helps to spread out the birth rate, and will not contribute to over-population.  Think of it that way.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	babysit a teething infant for 24 hours.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Is there anyway you can babysit? Being around a baby for an extended period of time sometimes helps you realize how hard it is and makes you want to wait a little longer. If you can't babysit then just wait it out, three years really isn't that long, it might seem like it now but I'm sure it will fly. What are your fiances reasons for not wanting to have a child? If they are legitimate reasons then maybe you should wait... enjoy your time you have now with your fiance, and you will have a baby before you know it!|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	Get married then get used to being married and then have a child.<br>  Waiting three years isn't that bad and don't argue over it.  It will happen when the time is right.  Understand why she wants to wait.|`|NAFLDet6aa	go to a day care and listen to them cry- it kills me every time....|`|CZg79Qy9aa	If you think you are ready and he is not....and its super important to you. Talk to him...give him all the pros on why you want one now.  Maybe he doesn't want kids at all and is putting it off or maybe he isn't financially enough secure or maybe he is worried about the responsibility and wants to do more couple things with you before he has to worry about a baby sitter and all that other stuff.  Find out what his fears are....adress them without attacking him...<br>     Ways to not want one right now.....try babysitting a lot in your home...prefereably newborns or teen agers or two year olds.  Volunteer at the maternity ward....something.<br>    If you think you really need a baby, explain why....if all else fails or he doesn't want kids....leave him.
GWveqx61aa	if you are trying all those could be false symptoms, but if you are due tomorrow,, run down to the dollar store get a preg test and take it, you would be far enuf to get a positive, but you didnt give us the days you had sex, if it was on or b4 feb 8 than you very well could be preg, so from the 4th to the 8th, were ur most fertile days, that bleeding sounds like it could be implantation bleeding, no need in worrying it only stresses us out more, good luck|`|RuyLwzA0aa	It def. sounds like you could be prego to me.

SlBsJ3NRaa	He pretty much committed double homicide. No one, including an 11 year old, should get away with that. I agree, it's a sad day when you have 11 year olds killing pregnant women, but at the same time, a slap on the wrist would be like saying hey, kill the people you don't like, if you're young you won't get in trouble. In the end, people can still visit him, talk to him if he goes to prison. What about the people who lost the woman and baby? They will never be able to speak to or see them again.|`|QI74CxD0aa	I guess that eliminates the illusion that all children that age are innocents.<br>  <br>  A murderer who is 11 years old is still a murderer.  The thing to make sure of now is that he does not hurt or kill someone else.  He should be put away in an institution of some sort for a long time, and if he is judged to be a danger, perhaps for his whole life.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	WHAT? I didn't hear anything about that! A 11 year old is old enough to understand what he did and why he did it. He should be put in prison.. that would scare the crap out of him. But no, he'll get a little slap on the wrists because he's young. Situations like this make me sick to my stomach. However if he had a mental disability, he should be put in a hospital for people who have mental disorders.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Kenzie and I use to be friends when I was younger and living in New Castle, PA.

I think by that age it is pretty much decided what type of person you will become..|`|i3pn4jNcaa	yup by 11 he should know right from wrong unless he has a mental problem|`|GUUgeptjaa	This is the world of Dr. Spock, the let your kids do what they want and don't punish them aside from time out or not buying them a toy, kids need discipline and they should be entrusted with grown up things, i.e guns with great care, his father holds some blame for letting an 11 year old have open access to a gun without supervision.<br>  <br>  He should be tried as an adult, because he chose to have a gun and use it irresponsibly to take a life...not to mention that he planned on killing this poor woman, he covered the gun and then went to her room and shot her, so yes he premeditated so he should be tried as an adult, and used as an example to these kids running around thinking it is ok to use guns to solve everything that they will not get away with murder by claiming, now, after the act, that they are just a child.  Once you cross that threshold of killing someone in cold blood (and he killed two people, the mom and the baby) you are no longer a child|`|oS6qvprNaa	people are bitter to bitter and what should be done is intensive therapy to help this kid not prison that wont solve anything that will just make this kid even more screwed up but the law system is flawed in more ways then one and it is up to the judge and in this instance this decision is wrong for one when I was eleven I always behaved very immature for my age and was still learning and I still am and I'm going to be twenty soon but what they should investigate is where this kid got the idea to kill two people was it the father something on television kids at school there could be a number of things that could play a big role in this|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Either this kid has a mental problem, was abused, or he knew what he was doing.<br>  <br>  If he has a mental problem, he needs a doctor.<br>  <br>  If he was abused, he needs counseling.<br>  <br>  If he knew what he was doing, he should be tried. The consequences shouldn't be as severe in my opinion, but he still killed somebody.|`|e01bQd95aa	Absolutely. With the freedom of expression in television, films, and video games of today, how can you not be aware that when you kill someone, they will not return back in the next game.<br>  And letting them out at 18 is really not any better. Do you really think that they will improve while they are in prison ?|`|jGiYcSh9aa	Absolutely. At 11 you know wrong from right, especially in cases like this and he should be held accountable for his actions in the exact same way that anyone else in this situation would be.|`|KU0tnveUaa	He should definitely not get tried as an adult.  There is still time to save him.  Obviously, something was not right with him and he needs help. Away from weapons lol|`|BiIdiINJaa	it doesn't matter how he's tried, as long as he spends the rest of his life in jail i think were all good|`|r39EDGhPaa	Yeah, he should be tried as an adult.<br>  He knew what he was doing and that it was wrong.
DHwPgw9iaa	She looks like she'd have a common name. Haylee, Emma, Hannah, Ava, Abigail, or Madison.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	I think she looks like a Sophia.  Am I right?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I just looked at your past questions and I do think she looks like her actual name.  It's very fitting for her.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I'm not sure but my guesses are:<br>  Victoria<br>  Mary<br>  Elizabeth/Elisabeth<br>  Isabella/Isabelle/Isabel<br>  <br>  So, what is her name??|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	Isabella <br>  Ally<br>  Maddie|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Eh, I have seen those pictures around.

7QjlDvs6aa	wow poor you how shameless are  you!!!!! keep your legs closed|`|ISCewF75aa	Wow **** happens, don't stress it.  I wouldn't have made those choices but hopefully you learn from them.  Get checked for STD's they can cause serious birth deffects.<br>  As for the fathers...  you can find out before if you get an amniocentisis, they draw amnioic fluid out and can test DNA at the doctors office.  These men will have to supply a DNA sample though.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	"You are NOT the father!"<br>  <br>  "yyyyyyyyyyeeeaaaaaaahhhhhwhhhhhoooooo...|`|RgdMyEq7aa	Uuh...that's really slutty of you but you could have the guys tested after you have the baby.
2013075b963c70173a3dc732a3f43ecfaa	Most insurances will accept new members in the event of marriage without a waiting period. Since there will be no lapse in coverage when she transitions to your policy, any current conditions she may have will be covered as per your policy guidelines. It does not matter what insurance she has (whether it be through work or a medicaid)... your insurance should take her on the moment you two are married.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are asking based on the possibility of her becoming pregnant during this time of transition, most insurances do not consider pregnancy a pre-existing condition. So even if she is pregnant when coming to your insurance, it will be covered. Also... if she becomes pregnant right away once you are married, it will also be covered-no waiting period.<br>  <br>  Take my advice with a grain of salt. Best plan of attack would be for you to call your provider and ask what their policy is to be 100% sure!
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? I would call him and ask him about it. When I was 9, I never wanted to see my dad cause his girlfriend was really hard on me, she was abusive and my dad did nothing. I would also make it clear to my daughter this was a serious matter, and if she was lying, I wouldn't be mad but she needs to tell me now. If she promised it was true, I would call the police. ?¤·?|`|eeaXYyCNaa	If she has bruises call the police right away.  They will probably contact CPS.  If no bruises then I would call CPS.  They will be able to help you.  I was a victim of child abuse and that is definitely child abuse.  And a 9 yr old knows that they should not have to feel pain like that.  Do something about it.  Do NOt let her go over there again!|`|ZxJw85hfaa	Oh my don't ignore this. I would go and talk to him and if he denies it then just don't let her go and visit him anymore, And if he complains then you cal the police and see what you can do all states have different laws. Believe your daughter she is 9 and  i don't think she would be lying to you. Take action. Don't show her to stay quiet!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes it does warrant a call. Talking to her Father will not help, as it will be a he said/she said fight. No wonder she doesn't want to go to his house. He is abusing her. Protect her with your life.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Call down to your local police station and ask how you go about things...thats what i would do so you dont get misinformed.|`|jUKEqDmwaa	i tell you what if someone did that to my kid dad mom or not they are going to get there butts kicked or put in jail|`|yQfaj7c2aa	I would be very concerned about this! I would first evaluate the situation... clarify in your own head that you aren't reporting him for any hard feelings on your part. Also, ensure that your daughter has no hard feelings from a different situation or a history of lying. These are just things you will want to understand for your own sake, either way what he did would be considered abusive and should be reported. If you don't stand up for your daughter who will? I would be skeptical of having my daughter around him at all with a temper like that!! <br>  Good Luck! And give yourself a big pat on the back for being there for your daughter!<br>  <br>  Belle|`|ZFE4Z00Haa	She's only 9, her dad has no right to do that to her. You should contact the police and CPS, and try to make sure her father can't go near her.<br>  <br>  It's sad that her own father did that to her. What are we coming to these days?|`|68d8ad07f5b8eb2e788d4d05c809eeeaaa	I would call police right now, and she will not go to visit this person again never and ever.|`|SimAO1IUaa	yes call visit the cps r police. whatver u do dont allow her to go there anymore! but i think you already knew that
OI3bf4yjaa	Depression during pregnancy is about as common as postpartum depression, affecting about 10-12 percent of pregnant women. If left untreated, the depression can worsen after the baby is born, putting the health of both you and your child at risk. There are medications out there that are safe to take while pregnant. If you really think that you are depressed, and it could be a risk to you and your baby, I would suggest talking to your doctor.|`|SnanuNKiaa	it could you should tell your Dr  next time you see them so they can take that into consideration. it is however, easy to be depressed during pregnancy since you have major mood swings due to raging hormones.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	I was seriously depressed during my first trimester of pregnancy to the point where my husband was almost forcing my to see a psychologist.<br>  <br>  As soon as I hit 14 weeks though things started to pick up and according to m y doctor is was just the hormonal fluctuations every woman goes through. I am now 36 weeks pregnant and have had no depression since my first trimester. <br>  <br>  I am not sure about what will happen after the baby is born but right now I feel happy and healthy. <br>  <br>  If your depression lasts longer than the first trimester I would recommend you see a doctor. It will not necessarily lead to post partum depression but rather be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	In the beginning of my pregnancy I did get depressed. I was so stressed that this pregnancy my result into a miscarriage like my first and I was stressed that I could not eat nor sleep due to the morning sickness. I also was frustrated that my belly wouldn't show at all because I'm overweight and it seemed like I was plain old fat and not pregnant. I grew tired of this going on everyday and I even got to the point where I told my bf I didn't want to be pregnant. I regret saying that now. I used to cry everyday for little things.<br>  Now I feel better, morning sickness has almost went away and I have a nice baby bump.|`|MTTpvrLNaa	It is rather a taboo subject when having a baby to feel down, people and family believe it is a joyous occasion, but their are negatives to pregnancy that should be addressed.<br>  Responsibility of a new life is rather daunting, being a 'good' parent.<br>  Also their is loss when having a baby, especially the first baby,freedom is lost, free to do as you please, go out when you wish.<br>  It's time to grow up and quick!<br>  so I wouldn't be surprised if it is these feelings you are feeling<br>  I wish you well. Terry.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	Me too, last time I don't remember feeling this bad. I feel really unattractive as I've already put on lots of weight and wasn't skinny before so I look massive, only 17 wks!<br>  <br>  I just keep thinking bout baby and that I can stop eating for a bit once had baby, lol.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congratulations x|`|claUGpVRaa	It's possible as your emotions are all over the place.<br>  I have suffered this in my pregnancy too, and I saw my doctor and midwife for help and they have been brilliant. <br>  Speak to your midwife re this - she will take your concerns seriously, honest and can refer you to see someone who can offer you help.<br>  I know I  was worried I was going to get post natal depression because I felt depressed during pregnancy but it's not necessarily the case.<br>  Good luck|`|sIr2fWh6aa	definitely normal since all of the hormone variations.  It could lead to post partum if you let it.  Just try not to get down and depressed.  Think about how amazing a baby is and how wonderful a gift!  good luck.|`|vygYFdsSaa	It's normal. Our hormones are going crazy right now. I've suffered depressed periods as well. I don't think it will necessarily turn into postpartum depression, but you should always be aware of the possibility.
5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	Yes it's fine.. I got my license last year when I was 6.5 months pregnant.|`|SnanuNKiaa	there is no problem driving. just make sure the seat belt sits below your bump.|`|AA10949869	Sure you should be fine:) I am 35 weeks pregnant and I have driven every day since day one. I still work full time so I have to drive, I am just more careful than I used to be. Before pregnancy I was Miss Speed Racer, lol...I love to drive fast! But now, I take things slow and easy because I would rather have my baby nice and healthy than to speed. So just be careful, follow the rules of the road and be cautious. Congrats on your little one and good luck with driving lessons:)|`|kwMuRDFjaa	I think it's still safe. Just be careful when practicing.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Go ahead. Be a little cautious.|`|Dz1AvLjwaa	no......|`|SndrZbn8aa	Lots of pregnant women drive everyday. Driving isn't going to hurt you or the baby. Of course the natural dangers that come with driving can hurt you or the baby... but that is the risk of being on the road and could happen even if you were just a passenger. I mean accidents of course. I know many insurance companies offer transportation for expectant mothers to get to doctor's appointments and the like. You may want to check that out as well, but you'll be fine driving.|`|AA10217725	Driving itself is no harm but while you are still learning there can be minor hits and bumps (which happens to everyone) and  they can be disastrous to you. I'd say dont go for it now. get someone to help you for the time being|`|sIr2fWh6aa	there's no problem taking the driving lessons.  just be careful!|`|G766dQjtaa	There is no problem taking driving lessons as long as you don't hit anything. Good luck!|`|M9HoeFOcaa	If you are really careful, its quite safe.|`|Vdho2ziRaa	no............
S4DNQkFraa	Sounds like implantation bleeding to me!! I would say that you are pregnant!! Take a test in a week or go see your doc for a blood test, it can be detected in your blood sooner. G/L!!|`|eNBoG2L5aa	I think so too.  And yes, this has happened to me and turned out to be pregnant.  I know you are really anxious to know, but give it a few more days to get a true reading.
z7w6xyOKaa	I'd like to know where their parents are and why they're not educating their damn children about sex. <br>  NO you can't get pregnant by giving someone oral sex. <br>  NO there is no such thing as an at home abortion. <br>  YES you can get pregnant even if he pulls out.<br>  YES if your period is 3 weeks late you should TAKE A F'ING TEST!<br>   <br>  Oh they drive me crazy with the stupid questions.  Most of the time I find myself questioning if they're seriously asking some of the crap.  But oh well, it'll never end lol.  Thanks for letting me vent.|`|xPR7g0wFaa	Even knowing that the majority of these questions are made up Fantasy its kind of entertaining to see what they come up with next. Sometimes we get so wrapped up in their lies that you just wanna strangle them.But the sad thing is, how do we really know if someone really needs help and is in trouble? Its not fair that the idiots take the seriousness away for the real ones.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Oh I always give my full 2 cents on these questions IF I bother to answer them. But of course to keep from getting reported (as some people here are sticklers), I add a "real" answer at the end. That way I can tell them how dumb they are but still follow the rules.<br>  <br>  What I REALLY think? I think that lots of them have seriously screwed up family lives. I think that a lot of them are behaving like whores. I think most of them have no self respect. I think it is very sad. I think I fear for the future.<br>  <br>  And now I feel like an elitist for saying all of that!|`|LDHu66Vraa	honestly, I wish I could just smack some of these teenie boppers. I mean really at 12 do you need to be having sex with 10 different people? I think not.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	It's not so much what I would say.  I can't word things the right way :)<br>  I think I'd like to smack them across the face...|`|4cbDjci4aa	don't get pregnant now because your only 14|`|3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	What about the chick that says she wants to be pregnant by her boyfriend so they can stay together, but yet she posts a question five minutes later stating she slept with two guys last month, and wants to know if she could be pregnant.<br>  <br>  And she's 16 to boot!!!<br>  <br>  I swear, some peoples children......<br>  <br>  Also...I just went through the pregnancy questions, and quite frankly, I am amazed.<br>  <br>  Is it just me, or is the youth of America getting dumber and dumber? I just can't wrap my mind around the situations kids get themselves in to these days. <br>  "I'm 12 and pregnant, and I don't want to get fat!" <br>  <br>  "Can I get pregnant if I have sex right after my period?<br>  <br>  "Can my girlfriend get pregnant if I rub my penis on my girl an hour after we do oral?"<br>  <br>  Dear G-D!!  Really?? Is your brain so engrossed in to futile things, that you don't even know how your OWN body works?<br>  <br>  And I'm not even going to comment on their use of grammar....<br>  <br>  Oh wait I just did...|`|1uz0ngfkaa	I would have to fully agree with the fact that there are so many stupid questions on here, i don't think theres anything we can say because those who ask the questions wouldn't understand our common sense.  <br>  I should just tell them what i think in their own words  .. Your stupid.  In other words, i absolutly wonder how your parents have raised you or who has been educating you but you need a bit more maturity and obviously stay in school!|`|fa7ah6gqaa	I think it shows how early kids are learning about things they shouldn't know about at least until highschool. When I was some of these ages, I didn't know what half this stuff was. Its crazy to think that one day there might be even a younger group of children on here asking crazy questions about them having sex with multiple people. When I see some of these questions, I think where on earth are these parents?? It's crazy on how America's youth is just going down, and the parents aren't doing anything about it. If you can't control your kid, send them to boot camp. Straighten them out. I only pray that the kids that are getting pregnant now at 14 and 16 learn and teach thier children from thier mistakes. I hope that this little epidemic that is going on with the crazy youngsters will stop before we have even more babies that are being put up for adoption and put in foster care, or are murdered.<br>  It's crazy. I'm only 20 and I still didn't see all these things when I was these ages. They need to go study for school or go play sports or something. Seriously. Where on earth are those parents??
nrqWwQBXaa	i know what you mean when people do that to me i say do you know i have a baby that will be up soon can we talk later. then call them later and ask them to not call between this time?|`|sS1jlF2naa	Yea, people are very retarded.|`|NoT3WGaEaa	What is retarded is someone wasting there time with a dumb question like this.|`|cRz31MlMaa	You could turn your mobile off ...|`|2cVrdMP0aa	yes|`|4SFHGHyfaa	Your probably over reacting..people still know you as the single girl or there friend instead of a parent|`|WfxpiomNaa	most people dont assume texting is a inconvience to you.<br>  if youre sleeping, you will just read and respond in the morning.<br>  <br>  just because your a mommy, dont expect people to kiss ur butt now and take it into consideration 24/7.|`|CgzgTNPAaa	i text during the nite. but im an eighth grader so thats diffferent. for a mom, i think thats really stupid, just turn your phone off and reply the next morning.|`|drEfr9waaa	They probably think it's ok to text  you at any given time.|`|KdgceJ95aa	If you know them tell them not to call after a certain time. People are really that stupid.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	You're too tranny fab to be a mom!|`|182c6604bba959c84026ef7306cf79bbaa	ur a pretty mom|`|DrT7eYvPaa	yea ppl can just be really dumb|`|VZFEB85Iaa	si senorita|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Its people who dont have kids. Last night my husband was putting our 2 year old daughter to bed( shes been sick and not wanting to go to bed till late). We are lucky that we dont get those kinda phone calls very often but his friend called at 11 oclock. My husband was still laying in bed with our daughter and she was asleep but that kinda sleep where any noise will wake her. Well his friend called and sounded upset, I figured it was an emergency because well it was late. Nope this guy wanted my husbands help on fixing his brothers computer, I was LIVID, I told him to tell him not to call again past 9 30 unless its an emergency or to text him. Well our daughter woke up and was up in till 12 30. So yea to your question people with out kids are freaking retarded sometimes and no your not overreacting.|`|AA10373285	Girl its not that they're retarded but they just dont give a sh**...really lol. Now i can see why you want to have your phone not on silent because your mom is a diabetic. I understand that situation. I know what you're going through but i dont have any kids but the idea is you're trying to get some sleep.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	Who is calling and what is it about? The fact that you're a mom seems irrelevant to this story. Its stupid that people would call or text you late at night about retarded things none the less though.|`|fhWrgq0baa	The fact that you are asking this question on this website proves that yes, people are indeed retarded.|`|OnwijTc3aa	Yeah people do stupid things when they're bored.  You can give me your number and I'll text you at random hours too!  You're not overreacting, I've had it happen too.  Just silent your phone.|`|dLlI92OWaa	ya i guess they are pretty retarded|`|5abb6cf20f6d1b8b8ef23d153a85ab34aa	To answer this question, I will relate my own experience of the local "walmartkmartargetstore" @ 11pm on a Saturday night while my husband stayed home with the kids:<br>  <br>  I was on a simple movie and junk food run (the kids were in bed and it was our chance to actually, finally watch a movie and indulge a bit). When I got there I found lots of people with children age 5 and under, wearing pajamas, barefoot, and wandering the store with pajama wearing and/or tattooed and scary parents.<br>  <br>  The most frightening of all was a family with several young children browsing the hard liquor section.<br>  <br>  My point: If this is a world in which, close to midnight, you can find families spending "quality time", in their pajamas, browsing for the strongest firewater available with their 5yr and under children as though it is totally normal....<br>  <br>  Yeah, there is something really, really profoundly wrong...
Fy9S6hjIaa	Invest in a laptop computer and move the X box into the bedroom.  Some other things to do are:<br>  <br>  Write a pregnancy diary full of letters to your child.<br>  <br>  Sew the baby a quilt<br>  <br>  Crochet or Knit<br>  <br>  Fold clothes (My husband would wash them and bring them to me to fold)<br>  <br>  Play saduko or crossword puzzles<br>  <br>  Make artwork for the baby's room<br>  <br>  Read alot of good books<br>  <br>  Tivo your favorite shows that come on in the evening and watch them the next day while your significant other is at work.  We would keep the TV off for the most part when my hubby was home because I got so lonely during the day that I just wanted to enjoy his company.|`|zwctZ812aa	When I was on bedrest I was allowed to be sitting, but everyone is different.  I was on bed rest for a preterm labor scare, but nothing happened so I got to go back off of it.  I'm not sure how it would be with an incompetent cervix.  I read quite a few books and set up a scrapbook for my son while I was on bed rest. I just designed all the pages and left places to paste the photos in.  It made creating a scrapbook with a new baby way easier, since you don't have so much time once that baby is born!! Good luck with keeping busy...bed rest is hard, but it will be worth it :-)|`|NMzlbWt8aa	bed rest can be included to mean, sitting on the couch and resting or sitting in a chair and resting... but double check with your dr just in case.  What he doesn't want you doing is a lot of unnecessary walking and lifting.  Mostly it means going to the bathroom and showering every few days.  Im so sorry you've been put on bed rest but... its the best thing for you really. My advice is to rent or get a lot of movies and make yourself comfy.
qqiVKUBpaa	Tell her that you've had someone else ask you if you can babysit their kids and that they've offered to pay you more. Mention that you would love to continue babysitting for her but you could use the extra money and if she'd like to fork out (insert your price here) you'll turn the other offer down. It's a total white lie, but this woman is taking advantage of you and I'm sure that since she works with your husband you would probably like to avoid unnecessary confronations with her. You deserve more than you are being paid. Again it's a total white lie, but it's an idea anyway.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|lzivF4Idaa	just tell her straight up. "you need to pay me more"|`|AA10943329	Make yourself "unavailable" to babysit. It sounds like you are being used|`|q0JTN9QAaa	Tell her what you charge and that you need half up front.  At my buisness I set my prices before services are rendered.  I don;t just wait till I'm done and see how much they want to pay me.<br>  <br>  If you went to McDonalds and ordered your food and then they gave it to you and you could just lay money on the counter and leave they would go broke because people will take advantage of anyone for any reason if given the chance. <br>  <br>  That is why they take your money before they give you the food.|`|LSKeLOIGaa	You should start off on a positive note like "I enjoy babysitting your child but..." and tell her from there.

AA10949869	Oh wow...where do I even start? You DO NOT need to be having a child this young! Please don't! Just because you have a child together does not mean your parents have to let you be together either...Maybe you should step back and think about WHY it is your parents don't want you to be with him...usually parents have a good reason for doing things like this...is he a bad influence on you? Does he do drugs? Drink? Is he mean to you in any way? Seriously look at the situation and think long and hard before you do something stupid. A baby is A LOT of responsibility, it isn't all fun and games and once you have that baby, you will be so busy with him/her that you won't even have time to spend with your boyfriend anyway...so really...just don't do it. It is not worth it. Wait until you are older and married, it makes it so much better:)<br>  <br>  ETA* YES! They can throw you out, I am being REAL. And even if they don't kick you out it doesn't mean they will pay for the baby and they technically have no obligations to your child whatsoever. This means you will both have to get jobs which will probably be minimum wage jobs which is still not enough money to support a baby especially if you plan on staying in school which I HIGHLY recommend! Go to targets website or any website, it doesn't really matter...and look up baby stuff and see how much it costs. BELIEVE ME, YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT! I just got done buying a bunch of things for my baby and it isn't cheap. Just SOME of the things you will need...crib, bassinet, diapers, clothes, burp cloths, towels and wash cloths, shampoo, soap, lotion, powder, baby oil, stroller, car seat, receiving blankets, crib sheets and blankets, bottles...the list goes on hunny. Just be smart, don't do it.|`|mpiwO5p9aa	You need to think real on how this is going to change your life....it's real...if you are not supporting yourself now then you have no idea what it is like to be a teen parent. I got pregnant at the age of 17 and it changed everything. It is not your parents job to take care of your baby if you get pregnant. I got pregnant when I was 17 and I am now 23 and I still have NOT been to a bar...I didnt get to go out with my friends and me and the father NEVER have any alone time nor do we get to go anywhere...You guys are so young and dont need to be trying to have a baby....they are very expensive....please think about it long and hard. you dont have a baby just to get married or to trap someone or to be with someone. and I am not being mean or anything I just want to know how it changes EVERYTHING. reading this almost made me want to cry because I know how it is to be a teen mom.... I have been on my own since 17 because my parents kicked me out when they found out.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	sweetie i am sorry but i am going to be very rude right now. i know how you feel to be torn apart from somebody you love... but its life. untill you are 18 your parents can do what they please. having a baby just for that reason is the most stupid and immature thing i have ever heard in my life. this will NOT make your parents want you two to be togeather. if anything, it is going to make them hate him. you need to really grow up and stop acting to immature and childish. at 16 & 17 you dont have NEARLY enough money to support a baby. not even close. now dont think im some old lady preaching to you, because im only 18 and im pregnant... but me and the babys dad are married & hes in the military... so we are financially stable and ready for a baby. im young, just like you, so i know it hurts and i know you dont want to loose your boyfriend. but you wont, you will still see him, talk to him... whatever. but im serious please dont get pregnant just to keep your boyfriend... you will be making a very big mistake for yourself and for your child. if your parents dont even want you to see your boyfriend; do you really think they will support this baby? what if they kick you out? dont think it can never happen, because it happens a lot. how will you pay for the baby? where will it live? how will it get insurence? how will you pay for the babys doctor appointments? you need to either open your eyes or slap yourself for thinking of something so stupid. i hope you realize it.|`|S3t69kh2aa	I can see why your parents do not want you together.  This is a very bad idea.  The worse thing you could do is get pregnant!|`|FvmgX0vNaa	no no no!  dont do it!|`|AA10332126	So, how is your boyfriend going to support you and the baby?  Is the local McDonald's hiring?  What about Taco Bell, because he's going to have to work days AND nights so that you can be a good mom and be home all day with the baby.  I don't know where you live, but rent is not so cheap these days.  Oh, and what if your boyfriend leaves you when your 8 months pregnant?  What will your tell your kid when he/she asks where is Daddy???  Of course, since he'll be working all the time to support you and the kid, the kid probably won't know who he is anyway.  <br>  <br>  YOU ARE ONLY A KID YOURSELF!!!!|`|3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	Hey, you have another question open right now, that says you slept with two guys last month....yeah that's "real love" and a sure sign that you belong together.<br>  <br>  Anyway......<br>  <br>  <br>  Getting pregnant to save a relationship is a BAD idea.<br>  <br>  A child is a big responsibility that no 16 and 17 year old is ready for.<br>  <br>  How will you support your child? <br>  <br>  Where will you live? <br>  <br>  How are you going to buy diapers and baby formula? <br>  <br>  Who is going to babysit your child while you go to school? (If you don't drop out)<br>  <br>  These are just a FEW questions that you need to ask yourself.<br>  <br>  This is a life we are talking about; not a bargaining chip that you use to get what you want.  <br>  <br>  Get on birth control and stay on it.<br>  <br>  Now I know you're stupid; and I quote.<br>  "we would live with one of our parents. they would pay for it-what can they do throw us out? get real. they just dont like his parents. we love sex and each other and we want a baby too! that way we can get what we wnat-we can be together."<br>  <br>  Did I call that or what?<br>  <br>  So your going to use your child, a human life, so you can shack up with your boyfriend? And mooch off your parents?<br>  <br>  Yeah, you're going to be mom of the year.<br>  <br>  Good luck with that.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Having a baby is a horrible horrible idea. Aside from the usual reason. How do you plan to support it once your parents find out and disown you? If you get pregnant just to stay with a guy, they're sure to do it. If this economy gets any worse a jobs at McDonalds are even going to be hard to get. You can't work anywhere else, you don't even have a H.S. education let alone a skill. Everyone is going to be getting on WIC and welfare.. It could get super hard to even get your hand out. You won't be able to afford to move out (a variety of reasons again). Your parents sure as heck won't let you and your bf move into your house... if they do it'll be a horrible atmosphere. And visa versa. Then you'll have to scoot by until you're both 18 (to get married) and he'll have to join the military (since you don't have a lot of other options) and you'll end up a single mom living alone wherever raising your child by yourself while he's deployed (remember your parents still resent you for being careless).
9Ht6M77Raa	Yes, the kegal exercises help because this type of exercise strengthens the pelvic floor  therefore making the pushing part easier. This is also something your physician will advise you to do after recovery from the birth to again strengthen the muscles. You need to make sure that you do them properly for it to be effective. It can also increase sexual responsiveness!   The pain depends on the type of delivery you have chosen with your physician. All deliveries are different but when the hard part is over, the pain isn't extreme and almost not thought of because you have just brought a human life into this world!  A  miraculous experience.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	IT HURTS A LOT!!!<br>  <br>  DRUGS... ask for LOTS of DRUGS...|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	It varies woman to woman. Some (damn lucky!) women say it's like menstrual cramps. Others...like me...are willing to do their own c-section after 2 hours if it will stop the pain. Kegals help strengthen the pelvic muscles and can actually help you push more efficiently, They also help avoid incontinence after birth (very common) and tighten things back up once you deliver. Every woman I know has been scared of the labor and birthing process. The best thing I can tell you is that the pain is temporary and once it's over you hardly remember it.
01Mu3wUeaa	I believe 100% that what we put into our body contributes A LOT to what we feel and think (Not always the case though)<br>  <br>  I have been raising my son on organic and all natural foods since he was cooking in the oven.I ate organic and natural food mostly (Although I couldn't escape the wrath of Ding Dongs and ice cream..and a few other goodies) <br>  <br>  He has no behavior issues and no health issues (hopefully it stays that way) My niece on the other hand is fed Mc Donald's, chips, donuts, soda candy etc. and her first french fry was at the tiny age of 9 months.<br>  <br>  She has had many colds and has behavior issues (although not too bad)<br>  <br>  Like I said, I believe that food affects us but that is not always the case.Some kids aren't fed crap and have issues while others are and have no issues<br>  <br>  I think that you should give the diet change a chance.What do you have to lose? <br>  <br>  You should also try a Omega-3 supplement as well.My son loves these chews:<br>  <a href="http://www.drsearsfamilyapproved.com/shopexd.asp---id=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsearsfamilyapproved.com/sho...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope all goes well|`|AA12221392	I have a Adhd child, and yes we did try this food change but it wasn't helpful for our son. <br>  <br>  If you beleive that just changing her food will help her, and have seen a improvement all ready, then by all means keep trying it. I mean if something works and you don't have to put those awfull meds in your childs body than go for it i say. (I wished this could of worked for ours)<br>  <br>  Some of the diet change may be hard to deal with as she gets older and wants certain foods, or when it comes time for her to go to parties, and special events and she is the only one that can't have the cake or ice cream. But if you start early she may not miss these things either. <br>  But Just be sure that this is really what is helping your child, I mean sometimes we will think this is working now and two weeks from now it may have no effect on her at all. So just be careful for setbacks, as we all know that they do happen. <br>  <br>  but for now it seems like you are doing a great job at helping your child without medicine and i think that is wonderful :)  Too many kids out there today that have to put these meds in their bodies every day just to have some kinda of function. <br>  Best of luck to you and your daughter|`|RA7JQkn8aa	Dear Tanya,how lovely to hear a parent explore all ideas,you sound as if you know what to do,but it is not easy in this Society to go a more "alternative "way. Diet is just one of many. <br>  Please give Drugs a miss,it is just not right ! <br>  You might like to read about other ways of healing like: Australian Bush-flower Remedies,Kinesiolgy,Reikie and Homeopathy.<br>  When it comes to our Children ,we have to think outside the mainstream Square,and even if you have never thought about this before we all are more then just a Body! It is not just the Body that needs healing. Doreen Virtue has a lovely Book called :"The Crystal Children" It is helpful in understanding why there are so many "Alphabet" Children...<br>  And please remember ,our children come to us to teach us,go with what your heart tells you,not your intellect!<br>  I wish you and your Child love and peace!|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I am not an experienced Momma but I think the route you are going is the best. Changing her diet is more natural than just medicating her. Med's are only temporary and changing her diet is healthier for her physically and mentally. Good luck. You sound like such a good Momma xoxo|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I took meds growing up, my parents let me go off them as I wished, and I did when I was in middle school.  In college I started them again.  I personally would rather take the meds and be able to eat whatever I want.  So there's an ADD patient's perspective for you.<br>  <br>  I was diagnosed in about 1996 probably, and if the diet changing theory existed then, my parents didn't know about it.  I didn't have a problem being on the meds.
jYPeis3Saa	i totally know where your coming from in regard to not having the birth you wanted. i too had an unexpected and unplanned c-section after 20hrs of labor. i HATE hearing about how everyone else had the easiest natural delivery. it feels like they are rubbing it your face. <br>  i try not to dwell on it too much though. im thankful that my son was born in a safe way that actually saved his life (he had a knot in his cord and if i would have progressed and pushed he probably wouldn't be here right now) <br>  im sad that i will never get to have a vaginal delivery. but i know that having c-sections for any future children is the best thing for all of us. <br>  <br>  don't stress too much about the time you missed. enjoy every single second of him now. my son will be 16 months this week, and i seriously cant believe how fast and how much he's grown, and how much hes become his own little person. every time i look at pictures of him from last year i get a little teary. it is sad. i think every parent misses how little their baby once was. <br>  <br>  try not to stress that you didn't enjoy him at the beginning. enjoy him now.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Take as much pictures of your baby|`|EmYNUZcXaa	my daughter is only 10 weeks old and i cry everyday and i'll watch her as she sleeps and cry and when i'm feeding her and she looks at me...i'll cry. when she makes new noises or gives you a new look, or when she smiled for the first time 2 weeks ago, i cried. maybe i cry too much? idk. its so emotional and try not to beat yourself up about it. just enjoy every moment from here on out.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	we all feel the same way when our tiny newborns transform into babies... it's amazing just how emotional it is..<br>  <br>  i cried for a long time when my son outgrew his newborn socks... and when i watched a video of him as a newborn and he was making those newborn sounds...<br>  <br>  but then i played peek a boo with him and he was laughing and laughing and i realised that 4mths is a great age to enjoy him as well. every day they learn something new.. and everyday we miss the old, but enjoy the new. Go with the flow and capture every moment you can though photos, videos, memory box and a journal. <br>  :)|`|nyuB4POqaa	Well not really sad, but when I look back at all the pictures i'm pretty shocked at how much she's grown in 4 months. I take lots and lots of pictures, and I'm really enjoying all these new things that she's doing. She's so much more fun now.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I know that my sister was upset about her daughter's 1st birthday approaching. She cried the day it came and as we sang "happy Birthday" to her. She feels like it happened too quickly.|`|2mHbi6Exaa	you've got to stop feeling guilty about it and enjoy him now. i'm going through the same thing, only my son is 18 months. the other day i just realized that even though i'm paying more attention now, the part of me that feels guilty is still keeping me from noticing things he's doing. I just try to live in the moment with him and enjoy every "momma" and "i love you" that falls from his precious little lips.|`|Efa5EYJJaa	My son is only 2 months old but he is getting so big so fast. He is growing out of his 0-3 month old clothes and I am about to get out his 3-6 month clothes. I was lucky and I didn't have the baby blues and I got away with a vaginal delivery (barely). It's not your fault. Just continue to enjoy him now and be there for him. I think every mom has her issues. We want to do every thing so perfect for our babies and we beat ourselves up when things don't go just right, even when it is beyond our control. I just try not to be stressed for my son, babies know when mommy is not happy and it can upset baby. The time does fly by doesn't it.|`|wr3EOC5Kaa	Pretty normal to miss or forget their first precious moments, getting used to the lack of sleep, your body recovering, your hormones going crazy - many of us have been there! You must not feel guilty, it happens to the best of us, it was all a blurr to me!<br>  Don't worry about the c-section, I had natural and ended up with a lot of stitches down there, it took me a good 6-8 weeks to start to feel normal again - I thought I would never be the same again, it was very, very scary!<br>  My girls are 7 and 4, this is my last year with my little one at home - she is off to school next year - I was going to go to work, but I decided not to and to stay at home with her and treasure every moment of our last year together (only if you can afford it!).<br>  It has gone very fast, and I have forgotten a lot of it, photos and video help me to remember, I also have a large diary that I write down the funny things my girls say, sometimes I read it and it brings back some wonderful moments!<br>  I write the things they say quickly on the white board in my kitchen on the fridge, then transfer it to my diary when I have time - otherwise I wouldn't think to write it in my diary at all.<br>  Your next baby will be easier, you may not feel so stressed, but the baby blues may get you again, I went really crazy when my children both hit about 7 months old - really lost the plot for a few months, but it did pass - thank goodness!<br>  He is here now, you have years of love ahead of you, but you won't remeber every moment - there are just too many great moments to remember!!!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	good thing is he won't remember it...just take it day by day, that is what i have to do, i have/had ppd pretty bad; i always loved my baby, but i never feel that i measure up to what i should have done, etc....i miss those baby days, but i also look forward to what she's gonna do new today....hth|`|AA10096832	Yes, it is bittersweet sometimes. But don't dwell in the past too much (easier said than done, I know!). As you said, you think you missed the first few weeks. You probably didn't. Even if you didn't have the baby blues, you wouldn't have been able to remember much because you were so damned tired! ;-)<br>  <br>  In any case, they are so unbelievably fun as they get older. I mean, it is AWESOME. Every day it's a new thing. So think about all the cool stuff you have to look forward to!
2GXgT981aa	I did.  I spotted, brown, from 5 weeks 5 days until about 7 weeks.  They did two ultrasounds and drew blood twice, scared the crap out of me by telling me I had a blighted ovum and was going to miscarry, and then it all turned out to be just fine.  I also had some light pink spotting right around 8 weeks, but it was because of having sex the day before.<br>  <br>  You might want to call your doctor and mention it, just in case.  They'd rather you call when you don't need to then not call and miss something important.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I didn't have a single bit of spotting, so I'm not much help to you there. You might want to give your doc a heads up if this keeps happening daily.

The kid named Kasten would probably be nicknamed "Castor Oil" but I'm not sure kids know what that is anymore.  Larity would probably get nicknamed Larry or Hilarity.  Kids will always find a way to make fun of other kids names.  Having a rare name isn't that rare, so presumably other kids will have rare names, too. <br>  <br>  Try googling the names and see what you come up with.  Or run the names by some kids and see what kind of nicknames they come up with.<br>  <br>  Presumably your wife and future mother of your kids will have an opinion on these.<br>  <br>  If you're not married, do you want to see these women in person and find out what they're like?|`|GKWFuMxoaa	i think Larity is very pretty.|`|AeE8ouawaa	I loved kasten ..

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? I'm sorry, but I don't think you should be given a dime. You may feel BECAUSE you're a teenager you NEED money to spend on pointless items such as movies or magazine, but you're wrong. Being a teenager is a transition into adulthood. You need to learn responsible on your own, but getting a part time job to buy items you desire. <br>  <br>  When I was 14, I started doing those jobs around the house for nothing in return. My mother and step father got home late every night, and nothing ever got done. When I got home from school I'd start my homework in the dinning room, and get dinner going. After, I would do the dishes, and then either clean the bathroom, or vacuum. I would feed all the animals daily, bring the garbage out when it was full, a load of laundry each day and so on. I never once expected anything from them. I just did it cause it needed to be done. On top of that, my mother paid for everything I had since the moment I was born, it was the least I could do. <br>  <br>  As a teenager, you should be helping out at home just to show some responsibility, just to show you're a decent child who wants to help out. You want money, get a job. You'll feel more proud of the fact you have earned what you buy, then taking more and more from your parents. ?¤·?|`|uQc4UA2Caa	$10 e week u should be doing most of that stuff to help your mum anyway.....dont u think|`|o1ibwPKPaa	Well I do nothing and I get 20 dollars a week.. It all depends on how much money your parents have and how much you do at home.. but you seem to do alot so I would say probably like 40 dollars a week if that is okay with you or maybe more?

But I was 14 once and I know how it is..<br>  <br>  First off, when negotiating allowances with your parents, you should take care of chores consistenly on a daily basis. Prove to them you are reliable and responsible.  It's not fair to get paid every week and do the job when you feel like it.. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to get your parents to pay you allowance, is write down the all the chores you do and how many times you do them per week.. Ask them how much they think cleaning the bathroom, kitchen and feeding the cat is worth..<br>  <br>  Let them tell you, you add the price up and whatever they offer you should take, because you don't have bills to pay yet. (Enjoy while you can.) So all your money can go on movies, candy, games, hair stuff or whatever you like and you won't have to keep asking your parents for money. But I think $15 per week is good enough for a 14 yr old..<br>  <br>  Be reasonable..
073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	Yes. I ordered one online. It's very soft. You can see pics of them at <a href="http://www.adiri.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.adiri.com</a>  We ended up not using ours b/c I have difficulty pumping. A waste of $ for us! Now our baby is 6 months and just starting solids (up til now she's been exclusively breastfed) and we've decided to forgo all bottle like things and go straight to a bit of water in a sippy cup. For now the sippy cup is more of a toy and learning experience than anything else as she still breastfeeds a lot. She does like her sippy cup though ... a soft spouted nuby.|`|pB1oXLz5aa	no clue. me and my wife use a bottle called soothie and It works pretty well plus it's very affordable. another good one is the playtex Ven-air|`|zwctZ812aa	Never heard of it, sorry, but I have had great luck with the playtex nursers.  They are readily available at any store and most babies don't have nipple confusion with them.  The problem I could see with using some obscure bottle like that would be where would you get them in a situation where you needed a bottle right then?
wE7lLCHSaa	I hear you 100%.  <br>  <br>  If someone doesn't want to spank his kid and instead find another means of punishment, fine.<br>  <br>  But I'm afraid it will soon become illegal on that false grounds that it scars children emotionally or teaches them violence is the answer.  If that were the case, we would have to admit that all of our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, as well as many of us ourselves are all psychologically damaged and violent.  As a person who was occasionally spanked during childhood, I find this laughable.  There's a whole lot more violence overall in the younger generations than there was in my grandfather's generation.  A whole lot less respect too.|`|1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	there are other ways to discipline your kids. time out, threaten to take their things away(like toys). i have a 4 yr old daughter and every now and again when she doesnt listen to me, the thought of spanking her enters my mind and then leaves very quickly. <br>  spanking is wrong.it teaches kids fear and does not at all show that you love them. i love my daughter and i dont want her to be afraid and thats why i dont spank her.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Legally, it is abuse.  And I'm sorry that they did that to you.  As far as why parents don't spank their children, maybe they found another method of disciplining that works.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	here here. i am with your girlfriend.. spanking is necessary for kids now a days. My grandmother spanked me an di turned out fine..but abuse like leaving bruises and causing harm that could land them in a hospital is a different story|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	A parent should spank their children, but only if necessary. There are other methods for obtaining discipline.<br>  <br>  I believe a parent should never hit children anywhere near the head.|`|5abb6cf20f6d1b8b8ef23d153a85ab34aa	I'm not going to be so foolish as to suggest that corporal punishment is never, ever a viable option (I'm not Dutch ;) or from the UK ;) LOL)<br>  <br>  That said, most parents leave it out of their repertoire out of fear the government will come in and snatch their children. For example, my son lied, ran off because he was mad, and so I'm being "punished" by an investigation by CPS. And he's the one who was misbehaving!<br>  <br>  It is getting scary out there. Even scarier yet, the child wellfare system can't even handle the cases they are taking on. It is hard to say, ultimately, whether children removed from homes end up in places better than where they were removed from. At the same time, however, kids need to be protected from truly abusive people who might harm (or God forbid, even kill) them.<br>  <br>  It is kind of a catch 22. <br>  <br>  To make matters worse, you have the confusing laws. For example:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.familyrightsassociation.com/info/spanking_laws.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.familyrightsassociation.com/i...</a><br>  <br>  Different states vary from vaguely supporting a poorly defined "reasonable" amount of parental force to very loosely worded statements about "emotional harm", etc.<br>  <br>  At this point, parents should be very careful. Clearly, other forms of behavior modification must be used, but in some cases, it is hard to say WHAT would be effective (e.g. a particularly defiant or physically violent child).|`|A6iJGksUaa	I do not believe that spanking is abuse. Beating a child constantly after something they did very bad is also legal. I do not believe these things are bad at all.<br>  Now....when you start to beat your child day in and day out, this is when it becomes illigal. When I was smaller my parents (mostly my mom) spanked me for the wrong deeds that I did. For example, when I got sent the the principles office and almost got suspended she pulled me around by my hair and slapped me constantly. As we got home she sat me over the couch and beat me with multiple items for over 30 minutes. Of course she didnt constantly beat me for 30 minutes, there were always breaks where she would yell at me and slap me. <br>  <br>  My dad also did the following (about 2 times in my life)--><br>  <br>  Spank me over his knee with a leather buckled belt until my bottom was red and bruised. Or at least when I was in deep sobs.<br>  <br>  My mom--><br>  Spanked me with her *hand<br>  *Belt<br>  *Paddle<br>  *horse whip<br>  <br>  I turned out fine and I do spank my children when they are misbehaving.|`|OTFZtGCaaa	I’m from Europe where spanking is normal – at least back then.  There was a time in my life (very early on) when I thought it was okay to slightly spank (but never someone else’s children).<br>  <br>  Then I came to the United States as an au pair and stayed with a family with three kids to take care of.  The easiest and most enjoyable job ever!  Why?  Because the parents always took time for their children and were actively involved in everything they did.  This was the first time I heard about positive reinforcement and initially I thought ‘how crazy’ … children have to do what adults tell them (and not because they get rewarded).  But since they weren’t my children, I did it however the parents wanted.  I could not believe how wonderfully mom’s plan/style worked … I hadn’t seen anything like this ever before.  These were ‘the’ best-behaved kids I’ve ever seen … and they didn’t get spanked … not a single time!  Back then I promised myself that if I ever have children, I’d apply the same methods.<br>  <br>  Violence creates violence.  What you experienced wasn’t love … it was desperation, stress, impatience or some other issues that your parents weren’t able to work out within themselves.  I very much believe in discipline and well-behaved children (something I unfortunately don’t see too often around here).  You shouldn’t let anything slide; it’s best to address matters right away so that there won’t be a second time – or, if there is a second time, there will be serious (non-physical) consequences.  Taking away certain things/toys or restrictions on/eliminations of something they enjoy usually does the job.  I’m a single mom, work full-time, but I’m never too stressed out to be calm with my daughter.  I love my child and I can’t see me laying hands on her – ever.  I have a very stern look which – if necessary –does the job.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I was spanked once in my life and im not a snob im a down to earth person. I do spank my child when nothing else is working, or the punishment fits the crime. What your parents did is abuse, you don't kick a child with steel toe boots or hit them in the face. I was slapped twice and both times it was deserved but i was a teenager. Spanking is fine what your parents did was abuse weather you see it that way or not. I fear for your children if your going to "discipline" them like your parents did.<br>  <br>  EDIT- sorry the country boy wont work with me, Im a Midwestern country girl all the way. My parents and grandparents didn't abuse me.|`|pB1oXLz5aa	I love all these people on here that equivalate spanking with abuse, no offense man, your folks were messed up and I got knocked around alot too but the simple answer is spanking is not a go-to punishment. it's only to be used occasionally and never ever ever ever when your angry. parent's that don't spank think they are doing their child a service or "proving that they love them" but all they are really doing is teaching their child to go through the motions needed to get out of trouble. <br>  If you want help your child then teach them a healthy fear of "wrong" your child should be afraid of what's "wrong" and my simply talking to them your not doing anything. Kids will do and say anything they have to in order to not be in trouble. but a loving spanking makes them think about whether or not to do it next time|`|SnQvsOPwaa	The wise old owl sat in the oak. The more he heard the less he spoke. The less he spoke the more he heard. Why aren't we all like that wise old bird.|`|IGcS9K62aa	There is a difference in not spanking and not disciplining. Spanking is not the only way to be a strict disciplinarian. I was strictly disciplined but never spanked. I believe if you go about it right spaking, as a method, it is not needed. However, if it's the only dynamic that works in certain situations it should most definitely be your right as a parent. <br>  <br>  I don't think it should ever cross into abuse. It should not leave bruises or marks. Parents should be able to get hands on with their children if the situation warrants it--but within reason. For the most part I was a really good kid. I was slapped once across the face, I was running my mouth and wouldn't stop. Oh boy did it work. In my beliefs force should be used as a tool to get the childs full attention and correct the behavior.. not punish. There are many much more effective ways to make a kids/teens life miserable!|`|ALvp7YRuaa	parents dese days dont want to get arrested and all that stuff... but ii think that they have rights to punish their kids but not to the point where they do it every single day for no reason.... ii hate kids who are spoil and think they can have everything and think their all that.. well ii learned from the best and ii aint no child that cries for help ii get what ii deserve because ii do wrong things and ii learn from it.. but people now these day are scared of their kids because one thing is that they can simply pick up the phone and call for help...so yah...|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	IMO, being spanked with the buckle end of a belt is ABUSE. Also with any belt that is other than a regular smooth belt; those can hurt plenty.  As for getting your butt kicked with steel-toed boots; maybe a drunken teen, yes. Otherwise, no. <br>  <br>  But just the STRAP on your country boy's bare butt ... you would be a tough kid and likely anything less wouldn't have fazed you.<br>  .|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·?

Not saying I think it should be illegal, but, I have never seen any long term progress due to spanking. Spanking is a band-aid for the short term. If all a child learns is "don't do this you'll get spanked" well.... I guess you will be spanking them all their lives? What a child needs to learn is "don't do this BECAUSE......." They need to know why. "Because you will get hit" reason will not last forever. Then, later don't be surprised when the child hits back..... I mean, you hit them.... why would they not hit? I could go on, by why?|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Because I don't believe in hurting my children. :) Nor was I ever spanked myself, and I turned out just fine, thanks. :) You can leave your little "Country Boy" life, out of the modern world.

I HATED my mother for beating me the way she did. I can't remember a day in my childhood (except when I was sick), that my mother didn't hit me, verbally abused me, attacked me, denied me food, turned over my room. Once, I took one marshmallow from the cupboard without asking her, and she made me eat two huge packets of the stuff. That's not discipline, that's abuse. <br>  <br>  Being hit with a metal spatula, kicked or spanked with a belt buckle is also abuse. And by the way you're talking, you're about to continue the cycle of abuse.<br>  <br>  I have made peace with my mother... my father was great and I'm sure if it wasn't for him, I would never have spoken to her again. But let me tell you, I'm NOT putting my children through that. Disciplining your children doesn't mean beating them black and blue - a smack on the butt or the hand (if they're smaller) here and there, is okay... but what you're describing is not.<br>  <br>  When children have clear boundaries, and if they know when they cross those boundaries they will be punished (grounding them, taking away privileges, sticking them in a corner, etc) you will have a far bigger impact on them than you would if you beat them into submission. I know this, because I lived this.<br>  <br>  I will NOT continue the cycle of abuse. <br>  <br>  Children who are severely beaten by their parents, do not behave because they respect their parents. They behave because they fear their parents. I'd rather my son respects me than fear me. I had thoughts of killing my mother - I'd rather not my children have the same fantasies.|`|OxFV92hJaa	My parents beat my brother and I black and blue. I hated them my whole life for that and many other reasons. I've just in the last year begun having a relationship with them, and they have missed out on my 3 kids' lives tremendously. Regrets are on myself and them. I was "bad", gave them hell and deserved an *** whoppin.....BUT...I didn't deserve to be left bruised for weeks, and left "broken" for all intensive purposes emotionally.<br>  <br>  I have spanked my 2 oldest kids, ages 4, and almost 15 months...a pop or 2 on the butt, and re-direction. I prefer to find other methods of achieving the outcome...but sometimes a pop on the butt is warranted. <br>  <br>  A spanking (a couple good swats on the butt) is fine. Black and blue marks and life long hurt is not. There is a big difference.|`|ZnHTfNycaa	I'll admit that there has been times when I have spanked my children. But do I think it is a good punishment? No. Do I think it should be used as discipline? No. <br>  I wish I never had raised my hand to either of my two girls. Why? Because it teaches them nothing. All it does is show your children that hitting someone when you are angry is okay. Spanking is done out of anger. It is not done because you love them and you think it is the best thing for them.<br>  I've changed my ways though. When I am at the end of my rope, I walk away. I take a little time out for myself and I send my daughters to their room until I am ready to deal with it in an appropriate manner. <br>  When I am calm, then I go in their room and talk with them one-on-one. This does help and it does solve problems. I'm actually teaching them something. <br>  I'm teaching them why they shouldn't act the way that they are acting. They are learning how their actions affect them in a negative or positive way. We are sharing our feelings and I'm also learning so much more about my children in the process.<br>  Spanking seems almost lazy to me now. It is like you don't want to bother explaining why something is bad, so you'd rather do a quick easy spank. <br>  Spanking also is very hypocritical. You want your children to become the best people possible. You don't want them to punch someone in the mouth because they don't agree with them. So you shouldn't hit them either when you don't agree with something they did. You should show your children the respect that you want them to show other people. <br>  There are much better ways to punish your children that get them thinking about what they did wrong. I remember when one of my daughters was younger, she clamped a whole bunch of clothes pegs on our kitten's tail. As you can imagine, I was very angry as I don't tolerate animal abuse. After I calmed down, I had a very long talk with her about how doing that hurts the kitten and how he as our family pet deserves love and respect. I also made her feed, brush, and help clean his litter box out for 2 weeks straight. I wanted her to see how he wasn't an object, but someone that we should love and take care of. She never hurt another animal again after that. <br>  If I had just spanked her, it would have meant nothing. She would have never learned the lesson that she did. <br>  I will never spank or hit my children or hurt them in any shape or form again. It solves nothing at all.

mqHL4UcRaa	You have every right to be upset. I wouldnt want my boyfriend running around drunk that close to the due date. The truth of the matter is, you could go into labor anytime. He needs to understand that its not the end of his social life just because your having a baby. You both will still be able to go out and have your fun times, just not right now. He needs to stay sober and occasionally see his friends, but be with you during this emotional time. Ask him to put himself in your shoes, what if he was carrying the baby? He wouldnt be out drinking & neither would you!<br>  <br>  Your fears are not ridiculous, its a reality. Your 36 weeks pregnant. Technically you will be full-term in 2 weeks! You could go into labor at anytime. Tell your husband how your feeling and not to put it off as "ridiculous" because ignoring how you feel at this point is ridiculous, selfish, and inconsiderate. Like I said its not the end of his social life, instead its the beginning of his family and he needs to be a supportive husband..|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	You are not being ridiculous.

Birth can be very stressful for men - sometimes even more so than for the woman giving birth. He may have fears of loosing you and being left to take care of the baby alone or losing you both.  Remember you have all the hormones pulling you through this experience and giving you strength.  He is supposed to be strong and expected to be there during the birth, however it is only recently in our human history that men have been involved in birth at all.  A father can have many worries but is expected to shoulder them without even mentioning them.  There is that whole macho thing where you don't talk about your fears or feelings, too.<br>  You probably are feeling like wanting to be near your mother at this time, for you need her support and understanding during labor.  Women throughout thousands of years have wanted to be with other women who understand and care for us during birth.<br>  If you can dig deep and decide what it is you want, then you can act without laying it all on him.  Perhaps, you can talk it over.  It may be he would prefer to be the dad in the waiting room rather than the coach at the bedside?  Could you deal with it if he would prefer this - and perhaps choose someone else for support - like your Mom? <br>  <br>  I personally expected too much of my husband during the birth of our son.  My husband was so stressed during the labor and birth (which ended up lasting 44 hours) that he did not bond with the baby afterwards for over a year.  His stress and lack of sleep during the labor and birth prevented him from being able to produce the hormones to bond with our son. I think it is vital to understand what the man truly wants and provide some support for the man during labor and birth.  His friends should be there for him if at all possible - too.|`|SndrZbn8aa	I can understand that he wants to live it up before the big responsibility comes along. Really you're the one doing all the work right now, the responsibility has already kicked in for you. I struggled with this with my husband and decided that if after the baby is born his behavior remains the same that I would have to make some serious decisions. But I didn't have to wait that long and he really has cleaned up his act a lot. He still flakes out on me a bit but I feel comfortable with everything he's doing and know he will be there through the labor and everything after. I would recommend that since this isn't his usual behavior to give him until the 39th week at least. Remind him the due date is any day and you need him to be clear minded when things get set into motion. Even if he's still a bit flaky around the due date once he sees that baby I'm sure it will be an eye opener for him. Like I said you're doing all the work right now and the responsibility maybe hasn't kicked in for him like it has for you.|`|mItsW20naa	As long as he is meeting your general needs and not doing anything that he really shouldn't then I would just let him get this out now. After you all have the baby life is going to completely change and you do tend to long for the days of freedom you once had.

I would like him at home but I know he needs a break from everything, including home life.  But, I also waited almost 10 years before we got pregnant, so i knew he had most of his "get it out of his system" stuff out of the way. now he prefers to come home a lot of times. I think your husband will come around, its just taking him time to adjust to the whole idea.  if it comes down to it tell him your going to stay with your parents till he decides to grow up|`|YkBb5y98aa	It sounds like he is taking things a little far, and I do not feel you are being ridiculous.

Don't accuse or talk down on him.  He's probably a little freaked out about being a provider (that's what my husband told me) to you and this little one. And even though he loves you dearly, we are not all peaches when we are pregnant (our hormones are in overdrive)!   I personally would not appreciate the drunkenness.  I would go and stay with my parents if he is gone a lot on business and you are worried about how to get to the hospital or having someone when you go into labor not because of his behavior recently.|`|fPeOy9Bnaa	I have a friend who felt like life would end as soon as he had his baby, but then he shared with me later that life only got better for him and he couldn't imagine not having his daughter.  I think his attitude will change and that he's just panicking right now because he doesn't know what to expect.<br>  Try to be loving and assuring, and he'll come through for you.=)|`|gTs61Jqgaa	You're not being unfair in any way if you tell him that you will go stay with your parents. I suggest that you do to be on the safe side. My ex-fiance is doing the very same thing to me... only a a little bit of a different situation. He also said he "just wanted to get it out of his system". Long story short, he didn't keep his promises to stop drinking and quit being gone all the time. Our relationship of 4 years is over, and he will be moving out March 1st.<br>  <br>  From my experience, make it very clear to him you don't approve, stay with your parents so he will get the picture.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Some men do become very anxious(anxiety) when they're about to be a father.  We, women, have 9 months to adjust because the baby is right there comfortable inside you and you can feel him or her move,etc.  Men, on the other hand, just realize a few months before the baby comes.  However, it is really irresponsible for him to put you through that stress, it's enough for the baby to come before.  It is also irresponsible for him to drink since he wouldn't be able to drive and if he would drive(you know what I mean).  If you think that he changed to he point that he could be aggressive if you tell him that you're going to your parents, just go when he's working because I truly believe that it's time for you to have a safe driver around.  Just the fact that he invites people over and you're not comfortable with it is irresponsible because you really need your rest.  The safest thing is to go to your parents.  If he's responsible he will go see you and promise to behave and be there for you.  If he doesn't, it will be hard for you but keep in mind that some men are scared of that responsibilities(of being a father) and that they forget that fear as soon as they see the baby and especially as soon as they hold and look at that tiny miracle.  I had three children and my husband is working as an insurance agent and he was always only one phone call away, I've been very lucky but maybe we were older than you are, I was in my thirties and he was in his forties.  Something tells me that if you go to your parents he will get the message and stop his fullishness.  He needs somebody other than you to tell him, you're not suppose to have arguments.  Just think about you and the baby.  Maybe a member of your family could put some sense in his man's head  LOL   Men!!!    Good Luck and God Bless!|`|1NCPPHR9aa	Tell him to shape up or you are going home to mother.|`|g7RnYMoNaa	This is not unfair to him at all. I think that is exactly what he needs to hear. So, rather the opposite, it is fair to him. It would be unfair not to let him know what you think and how you feel about this.|`|AA10244380	At this point in your pregnancy, he needs to be available to you 24/7. You could technically go into labor at any point,  Tell him this is the moment you need to see that he is going to be there for you now and from now on.  <br>  <br>  He's had enough cramming.  It's probably good he did get some partying out of the way, but no more.  I can totally understand about him freaking out, but enough is enough.  It's not fair that he gets to get drunk and have fun, while you have had to cut out drinking and lots of other things, just so you can give birth to his offspring.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope he comes around!<br>  <br>  PS  My husband and I were freaking out a little before we had our baby.  But... although our lives have changed, it's only for the better.  We are having such a good time with our son!  Yeah, the 1st year is crazy with a newborn and getting a routine, etc... but things DO settle down.  Just thought that would help you feel like things are going to be okay and tell your hubby just because his life is going to change does not mean he'll never have fun again!|`|AA10953561	Wow, honey! I feel for you. Personally, I think he's being unreasonable. You're pregnant, you're probably uncomfortable, and you don't have a lot of time before your little one will be here. He needs to think about you instead of himself. It's all well and good to go out with friends every once in a while, but to get drunk and spend more time with friends than alone with his wife (not to mention the mother of his child) is bordering on cruel. <br>  <br>  I'm 31 weeks pregnant and I know that if my honey were behaving like this I would be throwing a hissy fit. What's more important than being with the woman he loves? I think you're totally justified in feeling the way you feel. I'd bring the issue up one more time and tell him that you're really worried that he won't be there for you when the time comes. At 36 weeks it can happen at any time! I understand needing to get it out of his system, but how fast can he get the alcohol out when you go into active labor? If he says you're being ridiculous then bring up the idea of going to stay with your parents and see how he reacts.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!|`|oem5yEUDaa	Do you both realise that if you go into labour and he is drunk they will NOT let him in the delivery room with you? You need to put your foot down and say absolutely no more. You need his support and help, especially since you are nearing the end. You need to be resting right now. He is being incredibly immature, he has had over eight months to get it out of his system he should have thought about it sooner. He needs to grow up right now! I told my partner no drinking from when I was 37 weeks.
rM8WrUFNaa	Yes however. It has risks for the baby. Most Dr. wont do one unless you have a good reason for one...ex: possible father has a hereditary disease or someone in his family has one. They require the $1,000(+)bill for the procedure to be payed in Full before even considering it. I believe I read that the risk for your un born baby dieing is like 2 - 3 women in every 200 have a miscarriage. I know that in some cases it could ruin your whole life to not know for sure, but think of your child. <br>  <br>  And for those of you with negative comments....imagine if it were you, your friend, your sister. Quit being so damn judgmental, we're all only human, we all make mistakes!|`|IGcS9K62aa	Yes in theory but it's more invasive. It's best to wait until the child is born!|`|xOr67VDiaa	you can but there is risks|`|vygYFdsSaa	Yes, you can get an amniocentesis to test for paternity.|`|d6kekKgeaa	yes, its called an amnio, the stick a big needle into the uterus threw your stomic and retreave dna.... but it comes with misscarage risks.|`|3an5A7Cnaa	lmaoo why yu needa dna test? sluttttttttttttt
WPI0Z47saa	It can take up to 2 weeks for implantation.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	a couple of weeks|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Sperm can live in the vagina for up to 3 days. So it can take up to 3 days for the sperm to fertilize the egg. Once the egg is fertilized it goes through the implantation process which can take up to 10 days. <br>  <br>  So it can take up to 2 weeks for your baby to be conceived. Then another week before your body will produce a high enough level of the pregnancy hormone to test for.|`|d6kekKgeaa	it can take as long as three days for the sperm to fertalize the egg, as it may take the egg that long for the egg to get from the f. tube to the uterus and that's about how long the sperm can live inside the uterus- or so i've read in the hundreds of sites i've been scanning over the past few days. i'm sorry i can't recall which one to referance you to. try askjeeves and enter "pregnancy".|`|pB1oXLz5aa	if sperm enters an egg in the fallopian tube your in trouble. you can conseive a child just moments after sex. it doesn't take long but it takes time for the egg to attach itself to the uteral wall and to show up in a pregnancy test|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I believe it takes approximately 10 hours for sperm to reach the fallopian tube and then some time shortly after that one sperm enters an egg.|`|RyEfiuOGaa	Less than a day
RoFfCYGxaa	God, I really hope you are kidding, but considering some of the names you see out there I'm not sure you are...|`|5hCoZbqcaa	seriously why would you name your daughter Shawty??|`|Xdawv9Uqaa	seriously dude. don't do that to your kid. that is cruel and unusual.|`|3kBcHJIIaa	Yea, then go buy her a bib that reads Daddy's little whore.|`|CaWf475jaa	Not much sound like a bad adjective.|`|XrErnKvtaa	Please don't name your baby girl that...|`|fJbrjfSnaa	um ew...NO!!|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Shawntelle yes.<br>  Shawty no.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	is she small and from new yawk?|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	It's perfect.

Xrwvu5Uraa	no, you would not be having those kinds of symptoms the same week you got pregnant.<br>  <br>  I would wait a little longer to get a more effective result with your test, like when you miss a period or a couple days before it its due.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I had sore boobs and headaches of the bat. Then around 7 weeks started getting nauses..then got a stuffy nose at around 8 weeks and now almost 9 weeks not as nauses but still have sore boobs and stuffy nose.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|WPI0Z47saa	You would not have symptoms the same week that you had sex since it takes about 2 weeks after sex for youur baby to be conceived. Sore breasts happen abut when you are 3 weeks pregnant. It isn't that they are sore more like burning nipples. Nausea usually happens around 6 weeks after you are pregnant. That is also when the smell of foods can make you feel ill. Other than that nothing really happens for many more weeks after that. And yes, stress can make your period late. I guess you will know moe tomorrow. Good luck.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	first, i was getting sick once in a while. i didnt consiter it "morning sickness" because sometimes it was at night and it only happend a few times. then around 9 weeks i started getting very emotional. i am the kind of girl that doesnt cry and holds my emotions very well... but i started crying over everything. thoes were the only symptoms i got. not i have bigger boobs and a bigger tummy... but thats pregnancy haha.|`|acmsrOulaa	.vomiting<br>  .your period stops coming<br>  .stomach pains<br>  .thamatic bleading|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	you wouldn't have any symptoms that soon. But those are infact symptoms of pregnancy|`|Amkh6Fn8aa	OMG i craved sweets!! && MCDONALDS. lol hehe.<br>  Pickles,<br>  Ice cream,<br>  hot pockets,<br>  apples!!!!,<br>  pizza,<br>  <br>  were my top priorities <br>  oh and the smell of meat made me puke.<br>  the thought pf raw meat made me puke,<br>  <br>  i was very moody and tired.<br>  i wasnt myself at all!! congrats if you are!!!|`|aYlXO4wCaa	At first:<br>  -extreme tiredness/exhaustion/sleepiness<br>  -nauseous and sick to stomach<br>  -loss of appetite<br>  -dizzy and light headed<br>  <br>  I don't think you'd get symptoms that same week you got preg tho.
vygYFdsSaa	Don't feel silly, its all for the health of baby. How cute that your boyfriend wants you to wear it. I'd do it simply because he wanted me to. But I mean, you can never be too safe, so why not use it while you have it?|`|a98nJlnEaa	you can start wearing it when ever you want.. i dont drive but my husband starting making me sit in the backseat when i was 20 weeks.. :-)
lKXtfYFxaa	My husband sneezed and my 23 month old son said "Bless You" perfectly which he has never done before.  Afterwards, he pretended to sneeze a few times and would laugh that super cute baby laugh when we said bless you.|`|nwWBddEnaa	My daughter has just started crawling and pulling her self up on things and i was in the bath, she crawled into the bathroom and pulled herself up on the side of the bath because she wanted in lol x|`|nyuB4POqaa	My girl is almost 4 months, and I laugh at all these crazy noises she makes,it's hilarious<br>  hehe  i'm still laughing at your story|`|iuwLHT2Taa	i don't have one|`|rUPjr7hjaa	My baby is only 4 weeks old, so he can't do much yet :)<br>  I laugh at him because he's so darn cute!  He makes little noises that sound like my cat.  Sometimes I honestly don't know which one I heard.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? I think she is doing right. She is making is clear what he did was very wrong, and he is paying the price. If he was older and got caught stealing, he could go to prison. She is just scaring him so he won't do it again. I think she is just upset with him, and hoping this punishment will stop him from doing it again. ?¤·?|`|1uvrkDWNaa	She's his parent, you are not.  It's not like she is starving him or beating him, all she is doing is reiterating the fact that what he did was wrong.  After a punishment like that, I doubt he'll do it again.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	She did not go too far. When you are grounded at my house this is what you get. They don't do things to get grounded very often because they can't stand it. That is the whole idea of punishment, to not like it and to deter you from doing the same thing again.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes, she is a crazy woman, and she has him under house arrest. Don't YOU ever do something wrong, imagine what she'll do to you.|`|EyKJ737daa	Well not having children that old myself yet, I can't say what's right or wrong but personally I would not have gone to that extreme. Maybe grounded him for a month with no privileges. Supervise him with homework etc but certainly not confine him to his room, maybe send him outside to do some sweeping of the pavement or something where I can watch him but hey, that's just me.  he's definitely lucky that no charges were laid and I think from your description that he is truly sorry and regrets doing something so silly, I hope he learns his lesson and doesn't do it again.  Whether or not you can date her anymore is only something you and her can agree on, maybe you should put your feelings out to her and see what happens, I'm sure you'll get your answer then as to whether to continue the relationship or not.  Good luck and all the best.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	If they would have pressed charges he could have been in serious trouble.  I don't think being confined to his room for that long would be healthy for him-- everyone needs social interaction, even if it's just the family during a grounding.  Do you think she's really going to follow through with it for that long?<br>  <br>  For a week or two, it'd be fine.  All that and just not having to stay in his room would even be fine.  But I think four months in his room with nothing but books won't be good for him, that's just me.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	He stole something, and deserves what came of it. I don't feel that the punishment is too harsh. It's only four months and it's going to work as a great theft deterrent in the future.|`|6xBMfT1Laa	damn crazy mama..<br>  just sit her down and let her know that you think what she did was harsh. And make sure she knows ur not trying to tell her what to do with her kid. i feel bad for him =[|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Ya, that is sooo old school of her! Now days people realize that kids need exercise, sunshine and fresh air! Not to mention social interaction. Sorry but she sounds like a cave woman.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	She didn't go far at all.<br>  At least there are still some worthy parents out there..|`|SimAO1IUaa	OMG she has gone way to far. not that its okay to shoplift, but.... geeze. he is going to grow up resenting her|`|1KqknaUHaa	if you think you can't date her because of this tell her<br>  "You are too harsh on your son" or what every it is you think about the way she treats her son and tell her you can't be with someone who treats her own son like that.<br>  Maybe she'll change and it'll teach her not to be so harsh.<br>  <br>  I think that's is WAY harsh.<br>  I got caught shoplifting when I was 14 and I barely got grounded, I just couldn't go anywhere without my parents knowing exactly where and with who.|`|DaxHTmNTaa	While I cannot agree with the early bedtime, I do not personally think this punishment is too harsh. If the owner had pressed charges, even for something as silly as "girlie magazines", she as the parent would have been responsible for the fines, not to mention the fact he could have been sent to juvenile detention. She would have been responsible for driving him to and from community service, and he would have had a record.<br>  <br>  If she is strong right now, he may not get into more potentially serious trouble later. So he doesn't have the television, computer, phone, or video games? He would have a lot less if he was to be placed into juvenile detention. It is only for four months, and in this time, he can discover books and other activities to keep his interest. Of course he is going to test her limits, but stealing is not something he can play around with. It is a very serious crime with real consequences. Also, of course he is going to be sad and teary eyed - he is realizing she is serious about continuing on her punishment, and he does not like being without his computer, television, phone, or video games. She may loosen up as the months go on, but right now she needs to stand firm by her decision, or else he will learn he can walk right over her whenever she grounds him.<br>  <br>  If you have a problem with her parenting techniques, now is the time to talk to her about it. If you cannot agree with them, perhaps you are not ready for children yourself, nor are you ready for a relationship with her.|`|TQge2oBVaa	I believe that it is too harsh. Heres why:<br>  <br>  I have had countless friendsthat were overpunished like that. Every little thing they did wrong (he is a 13 year old boy, give him a break) got them in immense trouble. Now a lot of them (were college age) are doing everything they can. They love the freedom and it is ruining them. Now that they can't get in trouble by their parents they are experimentin with drugs, having one night stands, and partying a LOT. They are so exited to be free from overpunishing parents that they are ruining everything. This is not an "it might happen" thing. I am about 95% sure that it WILL happen to him. She needs to find the happy medium in how to punish her kid, because if you don't stay on that line, bad things are in the kids future.|`|KtlHpp3saa	i think 4 months is too much try like 2 months and he can earn his privlages back|`|b6EyFLgUaa	The punishment doesn't fit the crime I dont think. I think grounding like that just keeps the kids out of the parents hair because he or she doesnt want to deal with them and thats really sad. He needs friends he needs to go outside. If anything make him give up his free time for a good reason. Id say talk to her and ask if instead of this he volunteers at a hospital or something. Uses his time for good. It will look good on a resume and will keep him out of trouble but he will be able to talk to people and learn things from him. What she did was way to harsh hes just a kid and is curios. Maybe its time to have the talk with him as well about women and such.<br>  <br>  EDIT- For everyone saying he would go to jail if the store manager pressed charges he wouldn't. Hed get a fine and have to pay it, seriously they don't toss a 13 year old in jail for stealing a playboy. My sister was caught steeling at that age and they showed her what they did and they also didn't press charges but if they had the police told us what they would do.|`|kNLi16C6aa	I applaud this women. She is actually following through with her punishment.<br>  <br>  This child is 13, he is already starting to break rules, what happens when he is stronger and more determined, she won't be able to stop him when he's older, so it's better to enforce rules when they are younger.<br>  <br>  Of course he's going to be teary, he got caught! and now he's being punished. Sucks to do the time, but he'll be a better person in the long run.<br>  <br>  Thankfully for him, he didn't get charges pressed against him, that would definilty be a cross against his record. He'll be a more decent citizen and question his actions in the future.<br>  <br>  The punishment will help him think about being a better person next time round.<br>  <br>  A jail cell is more limiting.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? I don't think its cruel. If they did something bad enough, then yes. They need to know the enjoyable things in life are privileges, and bad behavior will remove all that. I think they should at least have a book, maybe cross words. Something to exercise the brain. ?¤·?|`|lzivF4Idaa	what did they do? not ALL day, but the majority of the day. yes i see it as fine if their actions warranted it. <br>  <br>  i would allow him a book.|`|rQKwu4vBaa	I do not consider putting a child in a room all day as punishment. There is really not negative reinforcement going on there. The child then you think... Ok I can do this and that and my only punishment would to sit in my room.|`|a4EiMhcNaa	YES anyone who yould keep there children from all social interaction is just a ****** ********.|`|rgOBHB5uaa	of course|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	yes it is..<br>  u shouldn't punish them in such way..|`|fNv2Re6baa	If there is proper ventilation and they may read or do homework (or even clean up their room!) then it is fine. As long as they are also allowed to use the bathroom, have Access to water and edible food. Edible as in not rotten, not like gourmet. If they have their basic needs (not wants) then it is perfectly fine.|`|SimAO1IUaa	i think its stupid when parents send kids to their room because its like whats the point its THEIR room they will go there when they want without even being asked anything so whats the punishment in that? getting sent to their own room? all day is cruel though. but i guess it depends on how old is your child. dont be too strict other wise your kids going to rebel agisnt you when its older trust me im a teenager we appreciate and sometimes may not understand good parenting but there IS such a thing as over doing it and trying too hard to be a good parent. kids will be kids..|`|kNLi16C6aa	As long as you provide adequate water and fresh air, and they are not restrained, it is perfectly fine in my opinion. And explain to them why they are there. <br>  <br>  If you don't enforce rules now, they are going to end in a much smaller and more confined space than their bedroom. A nice Jail cell.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	It really depends on what the kid did to deserve it. If they broke their parents' rules or broke the law, then no it isn't cruel.|`|MFWEkkd9aa	YES!!!  It's cruel.<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|KtlHpp3saa	yes it is|`|tkqkifq8aa	hell ya!!! u gotta go out  chill and do something but thanks for parents it doesn't happen!!!
nrqWwQBXaa	i think it is a good punishment. when i was growing up my mom would do the same thing as punishment it seemed to work?|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I remember my poor brother and sister having to go to bed at 7:30 on summer vacation! They would have to sit in their room and listen as their friends were still out side playing until the street lights came on 2 hours later. I always thought it was very cruel. But that might just be me.|`|sS1jlF2naa	I wouldn't say it's cruel, but it's kinda stupid cause you can send them to their bedroom but you can't make them go to sleep >.>|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Eh, the furthest I'd go with it would be to send a younger child to their room at 7pm and not allow them to come back out for the rest of the night. Teens spend most of their time in their room anyway, so it wouldn't be very affective.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	the length of time for it would depend on their age and thier offence.   No it is not cruel to be a parent that loves thier child and want to teach them good behavior and to be a respectful, responsible person.|`|UuYVehSsaa	8 PM is better; and dark out side is better too; but a bed time is fine even if its not a punishment.|`|S63ovAuZaa	well, i think u should give some free space, for gods sake he is a teen!<br>  well grounding punishment is something for like under 10 or 15 after than it becomes a overprotecting thing, consider that if u r his mom then u r mothering him too much, if u do that, he will turn into an unsocial person, no friends at all, so make sure u dun mother him too much|`|7iwZRuUmaa	bedtime should not be used for punishment. it has nothing to do with the behavior you are trying to correct and change. they are going to need therapy as adults to figure out what you were trying to accomplish.|`|1y1vGOpKaa	the problem is a child/teen doesnt have to fall asleep at 7 PM so they are likely to stay in awake in bed and masturbate, thus making their "punishment" actually a reward.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Nope.<br>  They break the rules, they get to deal with the punishment that their parents establish. Don't like it? Don't break the rules.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	If they don't want to go to bed at 7:00 then they should obey the rules.<br>  Just my opinion :)|`|MFWEkkd9aa	I have only ever sent my daughter to bed early ONCE and it had no effect on her whatsoever lol.<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|SimAO1IUaa	yes it is.|`|KdgceJ95aa	No, I have done it to my kids. Hopefully they will stop acting stupid. It is kinda mean but when nothing else works.|`|5abb6cf20f6d1b8b8ef23d153a85ab34aa	In winter I get up at night<br>  And dress by yellow candle-light.<br>  In summer quite the other way,<br>  I have to go to bed by day.<br>  <br>  I have to go to bed and see<br>  The birds still hopping on the tree,<br>  Or hear the grown-up people's feet<br>  Still going past me in the street.<br>  <br>  And does it not seem hard to you,<br>  When all the sky is clear and blue,<br>  And I should like so much to play,<br>  To have to go to bed by day?<br>  <br>  Robert L. Stevenson<br>  <br>  Nope, it isn't cruel. The children won't like it, necessarily, but good parenting isn't about giving children what they like. It is about giving them what they need.
qqiVKUBpaa	Braxton hicks aren't always painless. Mine felt almost exactly like menstrual cramps. I called my nurse and she said that that was completely normal and to hydrate myself and lay down for a few minutes. I think I was 20 something weeks pregnant when I felt my first one, so right about where you are. Could you have overdone it today? Or could you be dehydrated? Overexertion and dehydration can both bring on braxton hicks. Try resting and elevating your feet and see if that helps and try not to worry too much about it. Call your doctor in the morning but what you've described sure sounds like braxton hicks to me.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Braxton hicks dont hurt. They feel more like a muscle cramp like you would get in your leg (it gets real tight then releases), except its your stomach that is contracting.<br>  <br>  I would call the doctor. You may have gas or indigestion, but its best to let the doctor know whats going on with you.|`|a98nJlnEaa	you should call your dr.. i've asked a couple times on yahoo about period like cramps and some people say its strong braxton hicks or it sounds like labor.. i have a appointment on tuesday and im having my dr check me to easy my mind about preterm labor..|`|a42DFZHtaa	i mean im not an expert but it might be your stomache stretching out.. try rubbing cocoa butter on your skin to help with the stretch marks but i would see a doctor if the pain gets worse then it already is.|`|nyuB4POqaa	I think if you have any concerns you need to see your doctor.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	You need to see your doctor if your concerned. Yes Braxton Hicks are painless. Prehaps your experiencing stretching pains. Definately express your worries to the doctors. All the best.
a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	It could be low hcg level or due to period change but the best is for you to seek professional advice and find out by ultrasound or blood test if you are really pregnant.|`|0e16cb05bc41bf491dee9b4dcc4fd250aa	no u r not prego.|`|Ie2C7lPaaa	well this has happened with me a lot of times, that light period for just two days and then sore breast and fatigue and after several tests also it turns out to be negative.It can occur due to hormonal changes .<br>  <br>  You can wait  for a week and take a test. Again if you have the pregnancy symptoms but test turns out to be negative then you can go for blood hcg test or sonography for appropriate results.<br>  All the best.|`|H6hwoCHCaa	Most people don't realize this but It depends on how long your cycle is. You need to figure that out and figure out what days are your fertile days and your luetal days. this way you will know but it sounds like you have a 28 day cycle because my period came on jan. 15 and the next one came on feb.9 and my next period should be on March 4 and yours should be the 5 or 6. You should take a test around then. and your fertile week was last week.|`|AA11025973	Usually you should wait a week to retest but you could also see if you can find a stronger test and use your first morning urine! Good luck!!
W89Q30J7aa	The only time in pregnancy you should worry about discharge or blood is when its bright red as in 'fresh' blood, its completely normal 2 get discharge throughout your pregnancy and every day after, it is the vagina cleaning it self, and when not pregnant it is a sign that you are fertile, the heavier the discharge the more fertile u r, so discharge is a good thing, just a pain in the bum as it isn't very nice :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|WPI0Z47saa	You will discharge more than usual throughout your whole pregnancy and yellow is a common and normal color for this.|`|vygYFdsSaa	It's probably just a minuscule amount of bleeding. The cramps might have been implantation; I'm not sure. It sounds like nothing to worry about, but if it gets any darker brown (dried up blood) or red and more plentiful, you might want to check back.
ji8J9k6Baa	I don't mean to sound rude in any way~ but you need to call her doctor back and ask these questions to him/her.  Ask them over and over until you and your wife are both completely clear on all the questions.<br>  <br>  This is to important an issue and to dangerous to be addressing it to this site. You don't want to do anything unwilling incorrectly to jeopardize your baby in any way. <br>  <br>  Please call the folks with the knowledge~ the doctors~ they don't mind these questions.<br>  <br>  And write all your questions down, before you call~ leave room to write the doctors answers too.<br>  <br>  Good luck to all 3 of you.'<br>  Prayers.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	If the placenta is in front of the cervix she will have to get a c sectio|`|EyKJ737daa	No sweetie, I'm afraid it sounds like your wife may end up going for a c-section because if she goes into natural labour, there is a risk the placenta could come out first before the baby and that is not good.  That placenta needs to stay attached as long as possible especially before the baby is born.  Her body will naturally discard it once the baby is born if she has a normal problem free birth but as you have said, it's blocked by the placenta by 10%.  Any blockage and it does run the risk of coming out first.  You sound like a sweetie wanting to look after your wife and do what is best for her. All you can do now is wait and see what the doctors want to do.  Express your concerns to them and they should take that into account and make the safest and  best possible decision based on the facts to deliver the baby safely and to maintain your wife's health. Keep her resting in bed too.  I'm sure all will be just fine sweetie as long as you listen to the doctors.  Take care and all the very best of wishes to you and your wife.  Congratulations and a safe delivery xxx|`|jROpVbrhaa	I think better ask your doctor.they know best than anyone of us here.Good luck.

She is saying sorry just to come to your party. After that party, she will be bad again. I have a classmate like her. She deserves to be left out. She is a spoiled brat and she is acting like a president. She wants her fame. If she come to your party, she will act like the birthday girl. She is being with you just to come to your party.|`|vlKxV7Graa	i think its fair b/c she obviously doesnt like you or else she would have been nice to u and her sucking up is her trying to use u i think u made the  right choice!|`|nZVmkZSBaa	You were fair.. She was mean, you could be mean back. And besides, she would just tell her mates how bad your party was.. And be back to her bitchhy self in no time.<br>  Good luck. x.|`|iTi26ojQaa	It's YOUR party, and you don't have to invite anyone you don't want to invite. You didn't call her names when she said she was sorry, and you could have. So yes, that was fair for the was she has been treating you.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	No of course it was fair! It is your party afterall...If she is just being bitchy it isn't even worth inviting her. I had the same thing happen to me last year and I didn't invite her :P<br>  <br>  Have fun at your party, though!
zCWFy3Nvaa	I had my 1st son 2 yrs ago.He was born at 32 weeks weighing 6lbs 14oz.I had a natural birth.The only thing I recall usuing was some medicine they gave me like 4 hours before I gave birth so I could get some sleep.It didn't last more then 30 mins with all the contractions.My sons birth was pretty quick after my water broke.I pushed twice and there he was.It wasn't as painful as I thought it would be and I didn't have to deal with any needles.My sister had a c-section and her back still hurts where they inserted the needle in her spine.I enjoyed my natural birth for most of the part.The only bad part was being stitched up afterwards.It was way worse then the birth itself!Other then that I guess it depends on how fast things are going to progress.Good luck and I hope everything works out!!!|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I only had laughing gas for my labour.  It didn't take the pain away, but it made me not care about it as much.  It didn't make me laugh though, that's for sure!<br>  I did a lot of reading on pain relief methods.  An epidural can make labour last longer simply because she can't feel when she needs to push.<br>  I think you should see how you handle the pain personally.  I didn't think it was that bad - I thought it would be a lot worse.  But my pain tolerance might be higher than yours.<br>  Good luck :)|`|7QjlDvs6aa	i had both my boys naturally and had water births I would not have it any other way. I like that im in control an know what is going on as such. bith my births were very quick. Im 14wks pregnant #3 an plan on having this baby natural and water birth good luck.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	I had both mine all natural in a hospital. Both labors were quite quick and afterwards I felt great (and very hungry).  But you don't know at the start if they're going to be quick.|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	Well Natural birth will hurt unless its quick but if you want to take the risk go ahead, and epidural you feel nothing at all, and the baby is all drugged and happy too, yes people are against the whole the baby is drugged, but it cant hurt it at all, they are acutally r a lot more calm amking it better for the baby too.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	CONS; PAIN<br>  <br>  PROS; baby gets more hormones from your body
01Mu3wUeaa	Your parents did it because that is their religion.Since it is not your religion, it wouldn't make sense to have it done unless you and your husband really want it to be.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can make up your own little initiation dealy thing.That's what me and my fiancee did.(we are not religious and our families are that religious either)|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Does communion require the child to profess certain beliefs?  Because if it does, and your child doesn't believe in them (because he's not being raised by Catholics) then you're asking your child to lie.<br>  <br>  Personally, if I were you I would not send the child to communion.  You're not raising the child Catholic (presumably) so it seems like a pretty empty gesture.  Peer pressure is a poor reason to participate in a particular religion.  Religion is something you should embrace, not be goaded into.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	If neither you nor your husband are practicing Catholics, and your child is not being brought up in the Catholic faith, he should not be making his Fistr Communion.<br>  <br>  You need to tell your family that you are practicing Wicca and that your husband is an atheist.  <br>  <br>  Having your child make his first communion to uphold family tradition cheapens faith in God and is very disrespectful to God.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	Theres really no point in practicing a tradition just for the sake of tradition! I wrote an essay about that a few weeks ago in my composition 2 class. Its completely meaningless and I don't think you should do it.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	It would make everyone happy and as an atheist why does he care if they sprinkle water on your baby or not.  As a Wicca "Most"  and I am sure you are included have no problems being at a christian service.  It would make things easier if they just thought you were so they did not cram it down your throat every chance they got.<br>  <br>  The Buddha was a smart guy and he said all paths lead to enlightenment and he also said that we must learn a lesson in every life.  You would do your baby a service by exposing him to more than one religion and wicca pulls more teachings from Buddhism than one that had not studied both would thing.<br>  <br>  Both teach that the best path is the one you choose yourself and I believe you should be able to make an informed decision.  If your baby decides latter on that he is catholic than he will be glad you had it done if not with the religious diversity both in your family and that you will teach him growing up he wont hold it against you.<br>  <br>  If you don't it won't hurt my feelings, my son was not either, "nobody in my family is catholic at all"  but you will have to explain to some of your family why you did not have it done.|`|YR9h8p77aa	First Communion happens in the second grade.  It is when the child gets to first experience the Eucharist.  When you baptize a child you are making a promise to God that you will raise the child in the Church and it's teachings.  First Communion is a symbol that the child is old enough to accept the body and blood of Christ.  Confirmation happens in the eighth grade and is the child's choice to accept God.  If your child hasn't been baptized, then I wouldn't be too concerned with First Communion.  Also, if you are not an active member of a church, you may not have that easy of a time getting a baptism.  Most church's require baptism training before the blessed event.  Also, First Communion is part of Sunday School (Religious Education now) and your child will need to be enrolled in that to receive communion.<br>  <br>  All in all, if this is not the religion that you plan on raising your child in, don't worry about tradition...if he or she gets older and decides to join the church, they all have classes for adults to indoctrinate them in.  If you're not concerned, let it be their choice.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I wouldnt ..that would be a hypocrite
fa7ah6gqaa	You should probly call and make a doc. appointment. There could be many reasons for having an irregular period. And anything can delay a period, it's just a matter of how much of a delay. Stress and diet change and even a change in physical activity can screw with a period. I would go take a home test just to be sure, then make a doc appointment and maybe get on BC. It will even out your period.|`|AA10236778	Since you are sexually active, first thing is to get a pregnacy test.
pp9RzHvDaa	I'm reading this while at the same time feeling my daughter kicking inside of me and this question really makes me sick.<br>  <br>  Why have sex if you aren't ready for a baby?  Punishment is NOTHING compared to what you're about to have to go through.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Go to planned parenthood.The method depends how far along you are.If you are in the early, early stage, you will be given the "abortion pill" mifepristone pill (medicated abortion)|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Go to planned parenthood and tell them you want to get an abortion.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	You'll have to go to a professional.  You can't do it on your own without potentially hurting yourself very badly.<br>  Next time use your head and don't have unprotected sex...go on the pill and still make him use a condom.|`|9QF6GGyiaa	You can go to planned parenthood even if your under 18. Don't try anything else because you can really hurt yourself.|`|DT80y28Maa	you should just keep your legs closed|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Do not force a miscarriage upon yourself by any means. It is very dangerous and can lead to infection, sterility and even death. And there is always the risk (especially with taking medicine) that the fetus won't die, but will become deformed or retarded. You should see a doctor or go to your local Planned Parenthood to talk about your options. Doctors are required to keep your information confidential, so even if your parents were to ask about it, the doctor(s) cannot tell them a thing.

My favorite is Noah James!|`|DaxHTmNTaa	Unless you have a personal reason for having "James" for his middle name, why don't you make a combination of both of their picks?<br>  <br>  Perhaps Preston Elias, Noah Preston, or Lawson Madden?<br>  <br>  That way, both your husband and your brother feel as if they have been involved with the naming process, instead of one having his name choice picked over the other. That way, everyone wins in some way. :)|`|80OLLBZlaa	It's understandable that you want your brother to have some kind of input into the name, but I really think your husbands opinion should count for a little more.

aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	The sharp shooting pains can signal dilation.  That is a good thing.  You will probably go into labor any time now.<br>  <br>  One thing that might sound a little crazy is squat while holding on to the edge of the bed.  Put your legs pretty far apart and hold that position for a bit.  Or if you have one of those big exercise balls for crunches, sit on that with your legs far apart.  This will help the baby's head come down and it can get things moving. <br>  <br>  I know a lot of homebirthing mom's that swear by it!  Good luck!!  You will be a mommy before you know it!!|`|IGcS9K62aa	Sex and walking. Two of the best things you can do. You probably aren't into the sex thing right now so walk, walk, walk!

But you can help the LO along!|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	I can't say when the baby will come, but I can tell you that you are right not to want to be induced. My third child was induced at what we thought was 42 weeks, but has health problems that make me think we jumped the gun. I think my dates were off and he was actually early. Try walking, but not to far from your ride! Good luck, and congratulations!
Coc593Ikaa	Here is the informatin you need for the state of Georgia. And no, you can't just say that you notified your parent, they will have to notify ONE of your parents themselves to have proof of it. In GA, they only have to tell your mother or your father, not both. And be aware of the mandated 24-hour counseling requirement.<br>  <br>  You do have an option of going through the courts for approval instead. If there is an issue such as abuse in your home, then talk to your aunt about going this route. I highly doubt the courts will bypass notification just because you don't want to tell. You will have to have a real reason for bypassing notificaiton.<br>  <br>  I don't know your circumstance, so I'm not going to pass further jusdgment on you about this. I will only say that you should consider this very carefully. Abortion is not a thing easily forgotten.<br>  <br>  ADD: No, there is not. They will (should) require ID. And if you claim she is your guardian, they will want paperwork to prove it.|`|aD7kHTJNaa	I live in Ga. <br>  1. dont have an abortion-its MURDER!<br>  2. If you are under 18 a PARENT has to be there to sign the papers<br>  <br>  you need to tell your parents and talk to them about this. that baby has a beating heart and fingernails and it wants to continue living. imagine if your parents aborted you! it loves its mommy already (you)!! I know that you are young but you need to take a step back and read the work on the internet about all of the mothers who REGRET every day of their lives that they had never had the abortion. plus a lot of women get very (deeply) depressed after they have an abortion. Plus they are haunted by the baby-they go crazy when they really didnt want the baby at all to begin with. Also abortions cause cervical cancer (vaginal) later on. & abortions HURT LIKE H*LL-its a surgical procedure and they physicall CUT your insides with a knife (scaple)!! <br>  do not do it. Im 19 and I thought about it but never could. email me if you need to talk. please-before you do this. please. best of luck to you! much love!

4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	It is unclear what you are asking as you do not have a good grasp of English.<br>  <br>  A child "prodigy" is usually an exceptional child who demonstrates a unique ability for such a young age.  Mozart was a prodigy and many children demonstrate an uncanny ability for a particular subject such as maths.  By the time someone is around 16/17 (school leaving age) they would no longer be called a child prodigy and just a genius.<br>  <br>  There is much discussion over when adulthood actually starts.  Some people believe that a girl becomes a woman as soon as she has her first period.  The Jewish faith believes that a boy is a man at 15 when he has his Bar mitzvah.  At 16 in the UK, you can legally leave home, have relations and get married.  At age 17 you are old enough to drive and to fight for your country but not to drink!  At 18 you can vote, drink, buy cigarettes, get a credit card and pretty much everything else.  This is why 18 is generally considered the milestone of reaching adulthood.<br>  <br>  There are, however still some things in the UK that you must be 21 for.  You must be 21 to be an MP, drive an HGV, learn to fly, be sent to prison or adopt a child.<br>  <br>  As most people are not interested in any of these things 18 remains adulthood.<br>  <br>  As for the other part of your question - are you developed at 21?  Mentally, no but you think you know everything.  As the saying goes - youth is wasted on the young.  Physically, you probably look your best but you don't know how to make the most of yourself because you probably still hate the way you look.|`|lzivF4Idaa	what now?|`|VjdkaeL7aa	adulthood does not start at 21- by 21 most people have reached physical maturity and are adults- but adulthood occurs at varying times and ages for people. <br>  <br>  adulthood starts when you finish puberty (or your adolescence), puberty signifies the end of your childhood- a child prodigy is a child- that's anywhere from when you finish your infancy to when you reach adolescence, for a typical person (of which there is no such thing) that's from about 2-11.|`|IfzSyw6naa	Adulthood starts a lot younger than 21. As far as the law is concerned (at least here in the UK), you're an adult when you are 16 years old. And anyway, 21 is a bit old to be a child prodigy. Someone who is 5 or 6 years old can be called a child prodigy, but not someone who is 21 years old.|`|e160ceb9ca2ffde0eeab6549e5c41f80aa	If you are old enough to vote or join the army, you are not a child.|`|eXwnWqROaa	?????

pB1oXLz5aa	yogurt contains live bacterial cultures that aid in digestion so even the lactose intolerant can eat yogurt. I don't know about the cheese thing. I'd just start with a milder cheese since your baby is used to either formula or breast milk.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i never understood that either.<br>  <br>  i just didnt give my son anyting with cow's milk in it until he was 12 months|`|Efa5EYJJaa	Yes it is ok but in moderation. I would give a mild cheese like cheddar or colby. Be careful with cheese because too much can cause constipation. I wouldn't give anymore than just a few little bites. A little bit of yogurt is fine but not much. Unless your baby is lactose intolerant. Children can get the runs if they are lactose intolerant.

RSb195a3aa	My first guess is she's being bullied at school. If the teacher does not know, ask her a favor to watch your child a bit more. Try to know her friends and ask them some questions. Also, know her classmates and the other kids in school. Check her environment at school. Maybe it's a bully, maybe it's a teacher/an authority at school she's afraid of. <br>  <br>  Anyway, is everything alright at home? Maybe she's thinking of family problems and just can't bear to see it as she comes home. I don't think this is the case, though. Since you sound as a friendly, trustworthy, devoted parent.<br>  <br>  Maybe she's sick or something. Maybe she has sore eyes or it's just probably irritated. Go to the eye doctor to check, so you can eliminate this idea. You can also got to a pediatrician for a check-up because maybe she's experiencing something else. Also, there's the school counselor. Talk to the counselor to get more professional help.|`|AA10415381	ya, u are doing da right thing. u should try to approach her carefully. try to ask her in a very calm voice in order 4 her to calm. then, u should tell her not to be afraid coz u can protect her from any kind of harmful thing towards her|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You need to find out whats going on and quick.

I had a conference with the teacher and the little girls parents the mother was so embarrased and she paid for my daughters haircut! You arent doing anyhting bad you should talk to your daughter and talk to her with honesty tell her some of your stories when you were growing up so that she can see that you are her friend also and that you have been through that before and you know what that is like... see what happens, my daughter is 6 years old also and she tells me everything from who she likes, to the girls that dont like her and the reasons why, I mean kids are going to be kids no matter what you just have to show to your daughter that you arent just only her mother but that you are her best friend and she will come around you will see, I know that seeing your daughter coming home with her eyes red is heart breaking but sit her down and talk to her and reassure her that everything is going to be ok , and that those girls are just jelous!|`|PTwgXnauaa	Don't take it lightly. A girl 2 years of age is too young to have such strong hidden feelings.

Please do not ignore.

zwctZ812aa	My son cries 85% of the time when he is not hungry, wet, or sleepy, but is not being held.  So I just hold him.  He's just shy of 4 months, so I know I'm not spoiling him, and he's just voicing his need to be held and loved.  It gets frustrating sometimes because I never get a second to get anything done, but then I just remind myself how I need to enjoy every minute with him because before I know it, he will not want me to be holding and cuddling him all day long.  And then I'll miss it! If just picking him up doesn't work, I usually take him to walk around in the front yard, or if it is raining, take him to look out the window.|`|Gk00iL6waa	Consider other considerations which you haven't yet considered (sorry.)

Maybe it's an allergy.<br>  <br>  Turn the lights off if they're on. Turn them on if they're off. Stimulate him visually. Maybe he needs to be swaddled.

IGcS9K62aa	Pregnancy symptoms can easily be explained away. The only way to know is to take another test. Take it in the morning when your hormone levels would be highest. If it's negative I'd give it another week and try again. Either way contact your doctor. If your pregnant that's a given. If your not a sudden change in your cycle could be a sign of something else--you'll definitely want to get it checked out just in case!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	If you've had a faint positive it means your PREGNANT.

They are identical to PMS symptoms, but seems how you missed your period, I would say your pregnant.
EyKJ737daa	Are you not having anymore children because you can keep them for subsequent babies as nappies don't expire, otherwise I guess you could advertise at no charge down at your local supermarket notice board otherwise talk to some mother's groups, they might be interested or even spread the word for you.

Yucky... the only man parts I want to see are my hubby's<br>  <br>  Also if you think about it most pregnant women would only want to see the "man parts" that put their baby there in the 1st place not some sleezy stripper (friend or not) who swings his parts all over the town.|`|rM8WrUFNaa	Maybe if ur a redneck with no morals. Um no. Let me educate you a little.

The last thing you want is a man (one I'm not married to at that), dancing around me while I'm huge and uncomfortable, and thinking about babies, not sexy men gyrating around me... lol... when you're pregnant you go off 'other men' and it takes a while before you're in the mood for them again.|`|lzivF4Idaa	that sounds like a horrible idea.<br>  <br>  i personally wouldnt want a naked random dude gyrating his junk anywhere near my belly with my baby in it. but thats just me.....
15A4Aptoaa	Make sure he gets protein from other sources, like peanut butter, milk and eggs. Talk to your baby doctor when you have your next check up to make sure, but I suspect that it isn't a problem. Don't try to force him to eat meat, because it may be an instinctive aversion due to food intolerance. <br>  <br>  I don't know if this is of comfort but for some people meat just is not appealing. I am NOT vegetarian, I just rarely eat meat because it is not my favorite thing. I would just rather eat eggs or corn flakes. <br>  <br>  Good for you for being concerned about giving your child a balanced diet. Get a professional opinion but don't worry too much about it. If you have soup for dinner you may be able to give him a little soup and just mash crackers into it until it is thick like baby food... maybe he'll eat that and you can gradually try thinning it out. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Just keep putting it on his plate.  Kids don't know what they like.  One day he will pick it up and start eating it again.  My son went through the same thing.  He is now 2 and he eats meat like crazy.  I got my step daughter to eat broccoli like that.<br>  <br>  You just keep putting it on their plate and eventually they try it and they like it.  Sometimes they don't but, most of the time it works.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	sounds like my son, does he drink the broth? if so I just make chicken noodle soup and I take all the chicken! <br>  For the most part, just try to be creative to get those veggies in them.|`|bSChe6Tgaa	This is when they start kind of weeding out foods they do and don't like you are lucky he likes veggies that is a plus. Try to make the food look fun maybe that would help him want to eat it. For example into a smiley face. Just keep offering it to him eventually he will learn to like it. Don't force it only makes it worse.|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	well in a way thats a good thing|`|h4CAYUvNaa	He just doesn't like meat. You've got yourself a pot smoking hippy (that's sarcasm for the slower people here).|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Mine doesn't like meat too much either.  We make sure he gets a variety of beans, peanut butter, and other protein rich foods. <br>  <br>  Meat isn't really a necessity anyway!  Don't worry!|`|PqPc10Fgaa	Here try something like this instead...<br>  <br>  As your son's intake of table food increases, his formula intake decreases. Actually, you will want to encourage table food by cutting back on his formula. By now you can begin to substitute milk in a cup at mealtimes for the formula. If you overdo it on the formula you will be filling him up so that he is not hungry or motivated to eat other solids that provide important nutrition and developmental stimulation. <br>  <br>  Begin establishing a three meal a day schedule with snacks in between. Save the formula for snack time. After the first year a baby's food intake decreases, as does their milk intake. This is normal, so do not get concerned if you see it happen. As long as he is growing well he is getting enough to eat. <br>  <br>  Let me give you some guidelines so you can know how much of the different critical nutrients your son needs, and then how that translates into food intake. <br>  <br>  Protein: Minimum of 16 grams on a daily basis. 16 oz. of milk plus 1 oz. of meat = ample protein for the toddler. <br>  Fat: At least 30% of a toddler's calories should come from fat. Too little fat can result in "failure to thrive" where children do not get enough food to supply their energy and growth needs. <br>  Calories: 40 calories/day/inch of height = 1000 to 1300 calories/day <br>  calorie distribution is apt to look like this: <br>  16 grams protein = 64 calories<br>  44 grams fat = 396 calories<br>  210 grams carbohydrate = 840 calories<br>  Total = 1300 calories <br>  Sodium 325-1000mg/day <br>  Vitamin C 40 mg/day <br>  Vitamin A 2500 IU/day <br>  Calcium 800mg/day <br>  Iron 10mg/day <br>  Zinc 10mg/day <br>  Folate 50ug/day <br>  The last four nutrients I listed are the nutrients showing up as the most frequent nutritional inadequacies in toddlers. <br>  <br>  The specific nutritional needs translate into the following guidelines for feeding a toddler: <br>  <br>  2 to 3 cups of milk (remember...this milk can take many forms such as yogurt, cheese, pudding, etc.) <br>  4 servings of fruits or vegetables (1 tablespoon/year is the guideline for serving size.) One serving should be high in vitamin C and one should be high in vitamin A <br>  4 servings of bread and cereal: Kids may eat a disproportionately large amount from this group but this is fine so long as minimum requirements from other groups are being met. An iron fortified infant cereal should be included daily. <br>  2 servings of meat, beans, eggs, or peanut butter. A good serving of protein should be fed at every meal. A meal should provide protein, bread or cereal, fruit or vegetable or both and milk. <br>  Remember, you will be gradually getting to this kind of eating pattern. It will take time to get there. Add the new foods gradually so as not to overwhelm your son with too much new at once. If he has already eaten a lot of these foods in the form of baby food puree than you do not need to be as slow or deliberate as you were in his infancy in the quest to detect any potential allergies. Also, be flexible and remember these are only guidelines. Over the course of a few days, he may not come close to eating everything on the list. Just keep track over a weeks period of time and see if things balance out. If they don't you can make the necessary adjustments the next week. It may help to keep a little notebook in the kitchen to jot down what he eats for a while, until you get an intuitive sense that he is eating as he should. <br>  <br>  You can be creative in serving any of these item, for example, you said that you son only readily eats bread, and Cheerios. You can try serving him some pumpkin bread as a way to increase his intake of a vegetable high in vitamin A. Add a little dry powdered milk to the recipe and you can increase his protein and calcium intake. You can add pureed or shredded vegetables to hamburgers or meatloaf. Fruit can be drunk in the form of a 'smoothie' which is vanilla yogurt mixed in the blender with any combination of fruit that sounds yummy. An excellent combo is banana, vanilla yogurt and orange juice.|`|N7P52rdgaa	try to incorporate some beans or other high protein food into his diet.. my 2 year old daughter doesn't prefer meat and once she was old enough i started letting her have peanut butter on her crackers and she loved it and it was a good source of protein for her... he'll pick the foods he likes the best anyway and he may go through stages of what food he likes but you just have to substitute things in there that are good for him|`|JGMtvQ2oaa	hope he grows out of it; steak is great! (wait it out)<br>  <br>  but until you have a definite answer (as 1 year olds aren't very adept at providing) make sure he gets protein! supplements are an option<br>  <br>  best yet - consult with a pediatrician. this may be common
jYPeis3Saa	no.<br>  he picks up his food with his fingers|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	My son is going on 18 months and still doesn't really know how to use a spoon. When I feed him, he always gets his own spoon to play with, and lately he can get the food in his mouth... but for the most part it ends up in his hair, his eyes, his clothes... lol. He's great with finger foods though, and I'm in no hurry for him to figure out spoons, he'll get there eventually.|`|EyKJ737daa	Yes, most definitely.  She is at an advantage as she has older siblings and loves to copy them but she loves using her fork and spoon and can even stab her meat with the fork.  She is 17 months old today but has been doing this since she was about 13 months, maybe earlier, can't remember but I've always given her a fork and/or spoon for dinner, even finger foods so she can learn to copy and she has.  Your little one will do it too. If he is currently your only child then rest assured, if you have additional babies, they will pick it up much, much faster!  Enjoy watching him though, it really is fun to watch them as they master a new skill xx|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Penny's answer is hillarious... I am cracking up<br>  <br>  And no I dont think jumping straight to a FORK is a good idea but maybe a spoon for practice under close supervision.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Yes my son is pretty good with a fork and spoon.  He is even able to eat soup.  He makes a bit of a mess but it is all apart of learning!  He uses his hands too if he gets frustrated.|`|AA10096832	Nope. She would've stabbed herself in the eye with a fork. Takes a lot of coordination to do that.|`|2mHbi6Exaa	my son is 18 months and does really well with a fork and spoon. he doesn't always use them correctly, but he tries. he still really likes to use his hands, though, too.

dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? GOOD FOR YOU! Stand on your choice, and don't let her trick you. She is still a child and isn't capable of raising a child, not yet. Point out how you don't want to struggle when you have a baby and want to be able to give the baby everything. You want to be comfortable financially and have a job you love. Make it clear you want to live together first. And, if she is scared about living together, point out a baby is a bigger thing than that. Take her out to look at the baby stuff, and ask how she expects you two to pay for it now. <br>  <br>  I wanted a baby at 19. We had been dating for almost 5 years, living together for 1 year. He pointed this out and really opened my eyes. Now we can do it, only 2 years after. We both want it. Just point out the facts, and how you feel. ?¤·?|`|lzivF4Idaa	1- you havent even been dating for that long. why are you engaged?<br>  2- you're way too young, she's even younger<br>  3- i dont care what anybody says fast food job and 2-5 hours at autozone just isnt going to cut it. <br>  4- make sure she doesnt poke holes in your condoms|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Good for you for standing your ground. Put your foot down, you both don't work enough to support a child. You are right in saying that she might not be the one for you. She wants someone who can give her what she wants NOW and that's not you! Arguing over stupid things is not going to make a happy marriage. If she stopped using the pill, Stop having sex with her. It can go two ways.|`|FvmgX0vNaa	She is only 17.  You are 21.  At least you are thinking rationally!  A baby doesnt make your relationship or finances any better.  Just wait.  Get your finances together, go travelling, party, make some memories that you can share with your child much later.  If you have one now, your life with your fiancee will be strained and resentful.  How fair is that to a child?<br>  <br>  Seems to me like more and more women are using trap methods to tie men into having a baby.  (stopping the pill, taking fertility drugs, pulling out their IUD, claiming they are sterile).  Be careful.|`|VNwRNDz3aa	Your finacee needs to really think of the consequences of wanting a baby so soon if neither of you have financially ready for it.  Don't count on WIC.  I know a couple of girls that aren't married and only work part time and have a child and CAN'T get WIC.  You have PLENTY of time to have a child.  My husband and I have been together 9 years total (before and after the wedding).  We didn't put the cart before the horse.  We looked at our options first.  We made sure we had STABLE jobs with benefits and that we could afford to have me stay home to take care of the children so they don't go in daycare.  You and your fiancee need to know that the two of you can get along well emotionally and financially BEFORE adding a child into the mix.  That way, all the child rearing discussions are complete and you know you are ready.  A good way to see if you are, borrow a friends kids for the evening (it's a free sitter for them and practice for you).  We did that with our neighbors kids.  They are challenging anyway and we didn't go totally insane so we figured we can handle it.  Just remember,  you can't hit them back with a slush ball, even if they hit you first.  Water balloons are a free for all. :-)  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I would also suggest that you use some protection so you don't get thrown a curve ball and have to figure out what to do after the fact.|`|qRElKKjXaa	o.O<br>  <br>  Tell her that you'll have this conversation with her a year from now. In the meantime, save up, go to school and sort out your own lives before bringing a life into the world. If in a year you honestly think you are ready to get married and have a child, then go for it. I'm 17 and my boyfriend is 20, and we are pretty level-headed, hard-working people and we've been together since April 2007, and I can already tell you that a year from now, and maybe even fives years from now we aren't going to be ready. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your youth, think responsibly and plan long-term. If this girl is so impetuous and so unwilling to wait a year, then move on for your sake and hers.|`|gvWzfg74aa	I can tell u by experience that having a baby that young is hard im 19 yrs old with a 1 month old daughter its really hard especially when your a single parent i know what  shes thinking and i was the same way with my xboyfriend i wanted to get pregnant so we could b together like secure our future babies are not an entartaiment u guys still need 2 live life go 2 college buy a house go clubing a findout if this is the step u guys whant to make your gonna b working and shes gonna be with the baby all day tired frustared and gonna take it out on you shes 2 young also find your self another girl who is not forcesing u to have a baby|`|mJMzB2IRaa	You are not only too young to consider having a child, you are too young to be engaged.  Consider something for a minute - I bet that most of the people saying you are "too young" are older than you.  That means that we have already been your age.  Now we have the luxury of being able to look back at our lives and see things we may not have seen when we were your age.<br>  Good for you for having the sense to plan for the future - trust me, it gets here a lot faster than you think it will!  Secure an education and a career before you make such a monumental decision as marriage or having a child.  Btw - that's the correct order!  Marriage first, then consider having a child.  Both of these decisions have to be mutual - she wants it, AND you want it.  Don't be "talked into" something that you will have to live with for the rest of your life.<br>  She said that you will "make it".  Are you okay with just "making it"?  Ask someone who already made the choice to have an illegitimate child at a young age.  In fact, ask ANY parent how having a child changed their life.<br>  Good luck to you.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? First off, he should pay child support if he has custody of the daughter. Second of all, you can probably get custody of her, but he might just allow you to take her. Talk to him. ?¤·?|`|im3vWyv6aa	My brother just went through this.... you can and you should get full custody of her. But don't take her completely away. This is what my sister-in-law did to my brother. She took the girls and moved across the country. It was absolutely horrible. No daddy deserves to have his kids taken away in that manner.<br>  <br>  Get full custody with the intention of letting him regain his custody if he gets help for his drug use. Let him "see" her from time to time (under your supervision) so he can remember what it is he has to fight for.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, please do it in a caring way... for your daughters daddy. <br>  <br>  Best wishes....|`|VjdkaeL7aa	he must be found as an unfit parent- the fact that he smokes cannabis alone will not help your cause- doing things like bringing baggies to the police or trying to get him arrested for drug use will not help your case, it will in fact cause a greater scrutiny on both of you by child services. <br>  <br>  doing illegal drugs in front of your daughter does constitute a form of child abuse however and will however help your case-  if your daughter testifies that he does drugs in front of her, and you testify that he has refused to cease doing drugs in front of your daughter- you have full custody- you don't need a baggy- it will be inadmissable and hurt your case as it will be property unlawfully obtained.<br>  <br>  <br>  A positive detection of the drug plus your daughter and your own testimony will work well in court- the fact that he has not paid child support will be excellent for your case- however- he may rehabilitate, and pay his owed child support and eventually apply for access to his daughter.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I just want to put it out there that just because he smokes pot, that doesn't mean that it is a bad environment.<br>  <br>  I just found out that my neighbors have been smoking pot for years.It was quit a shocker because they seem like they would be uptight people.They have a nice house, five kids and great jobs.<br>  <br>  Pot is less harmless that alcohol is and will ever be.Just keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for your question, it really depends.Normally, you would have to prove that he does drugs in order to take custody.<br>  <br>  <br>  Does the father pay attention to the child at all? I can see why you wouldn't want to your daughter to see him if he neglects her but if he is good to her why would you want to take her away from her father?<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	It depends on where you live. If marijuana usage is illegal and you have proof that he does it, then I think you're in good shape to get sole custody. Which sucks for your daughter and her father... he will end up one day regretting all of his stupid mistakes and wasting his life on weed.  He sounds like a loser... sorry, I know I shouldn't say that but what kind of man would choose weed over his child and what kind of man wouldn't support his own kid.|`|KdgceJ95aa	Go to family court. They will give him drug tests.|`|fdc7d6b3e2f2f598afddee511dcf1082aa	My brother just went through the issue of a joint custody with his children's mother. Yes you can request/receive full custody of your daughter. The only thing is that you would have to bring forth some type of proof/evidence that he smokes and does other drugs while your daughter is present in his sight. The courts will usually grant you with full custody if the father is proven as an unfit parent.|`|Vw1GzleKaa	definetly but u some how u gotta have a proof or else there would be no evidence ,try to colect some residue /empty little bagie or think of something or also teh judge can order a drug test from him,but he could cheat by stop using before the court date ,so u have to be smart  n try colect some evidence or video/picture .cause my husband has full custody of his son cause da same reazon ,but in this case she got arrested n they found d drugs n plus the judge order her a test also ,which  came positive ....so u stay positive n|`|rQKwu4vBaa	I depends.

If so maybe, there has to reason some documented proof that he does.
jKMH27gKaa	Not trying to talk you out of it and I respect your decision, but I wanted to share: I was 110% sure I didn't want kids until I got pregnant at 38 years old; then I fell in love with that baby (everyone was shocked as I was the last person anyone thought would have a kid) and sadly, he passed away shortly after birth (I'm now 8 weeks pregnant). I learned more about the amazing ability a child who lives only 9 months has to completely change your outlook on life. Suddenly, loss of sleep, weight gain, stretch marks and moodiness seems so trivial -- if you're old enough (over 30) to know that you and your husband won't change your minds, go for it -- but if there's EVER a chance you might change your minds, just rely on birth control until you're sure. It's always good to think things like tattoos and vasectomies over for at least a few years, lol. I respect you for knowing what you want and am not saying don't do it---just make absolutely sure before your husband goes through an irreversible procedure.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If what worries you is not being a hot trophy wife, and you know that at age 38 or 40 you will still feel the same, then by all means...don't procreate. I'm still unclear on why you can't use a diaphragm (I used one before I was ready to have kids and was smart enough to realize I would not be the same person later in life)-- but then I guess it's less trouble for you to have your husband get a vasectomy than spend 2 minutes in the bathroom. At least you won't be passing on those genes to future generations.|`|uly3aFqtaa	You miss out on experiencing the most amazing miracle ever - creating life! :)<br>  <br>  Of course there's the Stretch-marks, Weight gain, Mood-swings, Peeing yourself when Coughing/Sneezing/Laughing, poor quality of Sleep...<br>  <br>  But it's all worth it in the end, and those problems can go away if you take care of your body. I'm not pregnant - nor have I even been - but i'm just stating my opinion :)<br>  <br>  Xx.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	I must say that I am currently 36 weeks pregnant and the only weight which I have put on is on my stomach. Because of this I should drop all the weight and be back to my normal weight shortly after the baby is born.<br>  <br>  I have no stretch marks and if anything I am actually healthier now than I have ever been. I think the biggest problem is pregnant women eat for 2 and don't do any form of exercise at all because they think they have to take it easy.<br>  <br>  If you eat healthy and look after yourself during pregnancy there will be no difference to your body after the pregnancy.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I just got stretch marks.  I really don't care about those though.  Only my husband will see them and he certainly doesn't care either.<br>  I weigh less and have a better body post pregnancy.  Weird, huh?  <br>  Hopefully I stay this way :) My baby is only 4 weeks old.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	i have a few stretch marks on my boobs and my upper legs, a few on my butt but none on my tummy, <br>  im only 34 weeks pregnant and i suspect i will get a few more<br>  my boobs are freaking HUGE ! lol|`|J38v75bvaa	i have a scar from my csection it looks like someone took a pen, made a mark across my tummy and smudged it. not very visible though. and some stretch marks that are gross but like the other person said, no one sees them but my hubby.<br>  <br>  made my skin better...i use to get alot of pimples but i haven't had one since i got pregnant back in aug of 07. <br>  <br>  my hair grows faster now, and its more straight.<br>  <br>  im about 30lbs smaller then what i was before i got pregnant, and my butt and boobs are smaller as well.<br>  <br>  only down side...after a month of morning sickness in my 1st trimester, i now have almost no sence of smell. kinda sucks but oh well.<br>  <br>  pregnancy isnt all that bad, but i understand not wanting kids. my aunt and unlce did the same thing. they have 2 kids...shadow and lulu...the most beautiful boxers i have ever seen...even shadow is fixed lol|`|0e3127e9ecee43459523cb403e3185ebaa	Actually, I am thankful that pregnancy has not done much to my body.  I have no stretch marks no viscose veins, no skin pigmentation whatsoever, which I hear alot about.  So it's all up to individual body, really.  I am basically back to my prenatal weight... after 2 pregnancies.  So I am one lucky mommy. :) You are only married for 3 years.  Maternal instincts may kick in later...I don't know.  But it's a really wonderful feeling having the baby inside you and feeling the baby move and kick ... that's just really magical for me.   All the best.|`|3gToWPZdaa	Pregnancy was actually awesome to me. I weigh less after baby than I did before, thanks to breastfeeding. Everything is pretty much the same as before. But this is because I took good care of myself; stayed hydrated to help fight stretch marks, ate healthy, did light exercise up until I delivered. Can't wait to do it again.|`|2GXgT981aa	Check out www.theshapeofamother.com.  It's an amazing site that aims to educating women about what REAL bodies look like after pregnancy, with the goal of acceptance and more realistic expectations.  Real women can post pictures of their bodies before, during, and after pregnancy, so it's a pretty good survey of what post-pregnancy bodies look like.|`|lm2j8g4oaa	are you sure? can't you just carry on with contraception for a while?<br>  what has pregnancy done to my body: it has at least temporarily relieved me of terrible pain from chronic illness hope it will last...Everything has changed but I feel and look a million times better am now 36 weeks. Good luck to you|`|nyuB4POqaa	Oh yeah your body changes drastically, but of course it goes back if you take care of yourself.<br>  My stomach still has that little pouch, but I'm working on it still.<br>  But I could care less about what my body looks like right now. My baby girl is my life, I wouldn't know where or what I'd be doing right now without her. I'd be so lonely without her. She's our world :)|`|cHROCt3Aaa	I was a size 5 when I got pregnant.<br>  <br>  Now I'm an 8/9. I'm 5'3 and I weigh about 125 lbs. I'm not fat, just curvy. My boobs are bigger. And I don't have any stretch marks. :)<br>  I'm happy with myself. I look like a woman instead of a kid.|`|ZqnSpyxiaa	Actually well in my experience I am smaller than I was after having my daughter (before baby 120 after baby 110) and the only bad thing is that my cup size actually got smaller after I finished breast feeding and I have stretch marks
dShnJ20raa	Explain to him how you feel and that you have to accept this in your own time. If you really do love him just keep reminding yourself that you do and that this baby is part of him and will be part of his life. Don't take it out on the baby it's not its fault it was born and it deserves all the support it can get. That means yours too if you decide you can stay with its dad. You just have to work on becoming more comfortable with the situation. Good luck.|`|RzYePezkaa	I know how you feel but on  a positive note it will prepare you for motherhood when you become pregnant if you help to take care of the baby when he has the child and another positive unlike with your own children you can give it back to mommy!Good luck and things will change you'll see.|`|Coc593Ikaa	First, it is "head over heels", not "head over hills". Think about it and it will make sense to you.<br>  <br>  Ok, for the big question! I would probably leave. My entire dating life, I never saw a man that has children already. I was too young to deal with all of the crap that goes along with it. I'm just straight up unwilling to date a man with a child from another woman. There are just too many quality men out there without kids. If you want to marry for life, then you need to choose well. I know that many women out there will strongly disagree with me, but here are my reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Do I want to be with a guy that isn't there for his child the way he should be? Why isn't he still with the mother? Did he not try? Is this the kind of man I want to have children with myself?<br>  2. Do I want to be with a guy that is there for his child the way he should be? In this case a lot of time will be lost to the other family. In the future, my children with him would suffer at the expense of the other family. They would give up weekends to the other children. Call me selfish, but I want a nice, tidy nuclear family. I know that many families are mixed, and that is fine. However, if choosing for myself, I want the best for me and my kids.<br>  3. There will always be jealousy issues. Now it is between you and the ex, but if you have kids then it will be between her kid and yours. And you will always be in the middle.<br>  4. Any issues that arise because of the child are not yours to attempt to fix. You will always have to watch as your bf and the ex work on it, no matter how much you love your stepchild.<br>  5. Location, location, location! What if the ex moves? Then the child moves with her? Then your man has the choice to follow or not...dragging you with him. If he goes, it is a pain in th rear for you to suffer at the whim of the ex. If he doesn't go, then you may question his quality as a father for not going after his child.<br>  <br>  See, sooooo complicated if you really think about it. Again, it all depends on you and what you are personally willing to deal with. If all of the extra life hoops are okay with you, then stay.

Very rarely is there a false positive on a home preg. test, but there are fals neg. because of your hormone levels.<br>  Good Luck!!|`|9QqGJ8Tyaa	The only way is pregnancy test! there are times that It could just be just your mind!
Xrwvu5Uraa	You wouldn't be feeling those kinds of signs if you only had sex a week ago. But wait until you miss your period or test a couple days before you are due. Good luck to you!|`|WPI0Z47saa	YOu wouldn't have symptoms before your missed period like that. You will get symptoms when you are closer to 3-4 weeks pregnant and smetimes later. Most women don't even now that they are pregnant for the first 4-6 weeks. It will happen soon enough but this sounds like wishful thinking at this point. You will have to wait to see if you miss your period though. Good luck.|`|mpiwO5p9aa	those sound like pregnancy symptoms but it might not be .... I know that when I first started thinking I was pregnant I had all those, if you take a test it might still be too soon to show up...I found out that i was 4 weeks pregnant and the lines on the test were very faint|`|nyuB4POqaa	Yes you can be pregnant, but I really doubt you'd be having symptoms this early. <br>  Sorry, but it's probably just your period due
HpWCjBv6aa	I don't believe so.  I think there has to be some sort of signing over the house to him.  Maybe your boyfriend should try to contact his father to help sort all of this out.<br>  <br>  eta: if her name is also on the title to the house, then yes, she needs to sign anything for the house to be turned over.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Yes, Both parents need to sign it over.  It can't be one or the other.  Indirectly, While he may be able to handle the bills.  Having the house turned over to him, would mean, his is also responsible for the mortgage and, maintenance of the house.
IGcS9K62aa	Chances are no. <br>  <br>  But it is very possible. When you period finally does arrive, you will have ovulated before that. (My daughter is 5 months and I still haven't had a period.) So you're like a ticking time bomb, your fertile egg can be released at any moment. However, breastfeeding often stops individuals from ovulating (and such your period). It's not guaranteed though. Like I said, ticking time bomb, you have no indicator as to when it will come!<br>  <br>  If you are planning on having another LO soon I would at least use protection until your body returns to normal. That way if you get pregnant you'll know sooner. If you were pregnant now you don't really have any way to know. You don't have a period to measure it by. So do you plan to act as if you were pregnant in the mean time just in case (i.e. prenatals, no alcohol, layin off the sushi, no amusement rides)?  Then go for it, but if you want a little ease use BC in the meantime!|`|OHmQMJeiaa	its very possible but the body takes a while to get back to normal, so don't think about it too much. i ve heard that breast feeding helps with no getting pregnant but its not guaranteed. good luck and congrats on ur baby...|`|mpiwO5p9aa	I do believe that you can get pregnant even though you just had a baby. I would start taking test's if you dont get your period. I know that some people bleed 6 weeks after birth so that was your period there. just keep waiting for your period and take tests in the mean time. Good luck girl...|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	I saw a commercial that said something like three out of four women can't read a pregnancy test. It's like, an IQ test for blondes or something.|`|sIX1nhCFaa	yes it is very likely, but you should do another home pregnancy test then see ur doctor, congratz if u r!! Goodluck!|`|Hm0bCjYFaa	It is possible but unlikely.|`|HkDUxkS4aa	Honestly, if you dont want ANOTHER child always use protection!|`|Amkh6Fn8aa	sounds like it congrats!!!!!!!
96HWpdkFaa	Start taking prenatal vitamins now. You can get them at walmart or CVS or Wallgreens...any place like that. They are good for you and the baby and get your body prepared for a baby. Keep taking them after you get pregnant also because it can help preven birth defects and help prevent misscarige and help give you and your baby enough nutriants.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!
3gToWPZdaa	If you want to get more exact about when you're ovulating, you could try fertility charting by basal body temperature. Learn more here: <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com</a><br>  <br>  You can take Flintstones gummy vitamins; this is what I took during TTC and the whole first trimester since the prenatals made me sick.<br>  <br>  When you are TTC, it's best to avoid smoking or alcohol as you could fall pregnant any given month.<br>  <br>  It may take a couple months for the birth control to get out of your system, but it also might not. If you decide to start charting, it's best to get started as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  You can call a gynecologist and ask for a preconception checkup if you'd like, as well.|`|d6kekKgeaa	my best friend got pregers having break-up sex a week after throwing out all her bc, so you can get pregers as soon as you stop taking the pill at least. other then that, 14 days after the first day of your last period is the time to have sex. as far as extra helpers, check webmd.com|`|4CawfRxdaa	Well it takes about 3 months for your birth control to really wear off before it should become effective in your chances of getting pregnant. Other than that all I can think of is sex without condoms.
WPI0Z47saa	Seriously it can cost about a quarter of a million or more per child through the age of 18 for the basics not including college or thing that the kid just wants like birthday parties or extra activities and lessons. Just google it if you want a breakdown on averages. It is really scary. It isn't typically possible to save up before hand, unless you are stinking rich, especially if you factor in the cost of just you and your spouse need to live off of now.<br>  Below is a calculator that will help you to determine how much the first year costs.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Oh gosh, whatever you think you will need and then double it lol. Honestly a problem we have been having in our little family is that my fiance and I both work but we don't make a ton of money but we make too much money to qualify for housing/low income apts/food stamps, etc. But after car payments, gas, insurance, diapers, food etc we are always broke!

I really doubt it.<br>  You need to think about everything that comes with having a child and at your age you are not capable of doing so by yourself and I doubt your parents will be to happy about it either.<br>  <br>  Go finish school!|`|xXiCghR4aa	I'm 19 now, but when I was your age I wanted to have a baby too. I still want to have one, but I know that it's not really a practical choice.<br>  <br>  I know it's probably not what you want to hear but having a child at your age usually leads parental dependancy on your part. <br>  <br>  If you're with someone who you love and you both agree to have a child together then I feel like as long as you both are financially secure and independant than this would be okay. <br>  <br>  However, I think it would be wise if you finished school, got a job, and at least moved in together with the would be father, that way you guys know if your family will work out. <br>  <br>  You don't want to depend on your mom and dad for everything. Make your life your own before you create a new one.|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	It's like sentencing every child you will ever have to being poor their entire lives.  The factors that are worst for raising children are low income of the mother at the birth of first child, and low education of the mother.  When you have your first child at a young age, it affects every child you have after that.  Read the book "Freakonomics" for details: it has a whole chapter on this.<br>  <br>  You won't be able to go to parties when you're 21, because you'll have a five-year-old.  You won't be able to make much money because you'll spend it on child care and doctor's visits and school clothes for your kid.  Boys won't date you because you have a kid, and the guy who makes the baby with you will disappear and find someone else and leave you to babysit for the next 18 years.  Your body changes shape and your breasts droop and you have lines and wrinkles.<br>  <br>  Oh, and then the kid turns into a bratty teenager who screams "I hate you!" and slams their door and never says thank you and breaks curfew and runs off with some poor idiot and you're a grandmother when you're 33 but you have to stay home and take care of that kid because your kid wants to go out and party.<br>  <br>  How does that sound?  Having a kid is not a picnic.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Bad bad bad idea, you have your whole future ahead of you and if you have a kid I guarantee you will be working full time right away to support yourself and it's more than likely you won't go to college and if you do it won't be until you're in your mid-twenties or thirties. You would regret it big time later in your life. Just wait and you can have kids when you get married to a guy you love. It'll be worth it.|`|BUvvstsjaa	How would you like to be grounded for twenty-one years?  I suggest you wait until you're thirty.|`|y6Myl0Imaa	why do you want a baby do you even have a steady job ha no im sure u dont girls like u make me sick|`|g2JlIuRcaa	bad bad idea|`|55CpRJDvaa	No you don't.|`|Y5vpbTICaa	My sister had a baby at the age of 15 and she didn't tell my parents until she started to show. My parents were very mad but there wasn't anything they could have really done, and we are catholics so we couldn't get an abortion. So my sister kept it and many time she regrets having the baby at a very young age because my parents wouldn't babysit for her so she can go out with her friends to movies and parties. If it was during the day she would have to take the baby with her and it was hard. I tried helping but I was 10yrs at the time and going to school so I had to concentrate on my studies. My sister did not finish high school and shes been working since she was 18. She is now 28 and my nephew is 13. She has other kids but she did not get to fully enjoy her life as a teenager. Right now she is so focus into working and putting her kids through school I think she forgot how to party. Don't do it yet, there are so many things you are going to miss out on. Trust me i'm 23 now and im pregnant, I'm still at the partying age but I cant.|`|cRxoNPYkaa	This is one of those things that you can never go back.  Once you have a baby, you are now a mom forever.  I look at it this way.  Do it now, and doors are closed.  What would it hurt to wait until you are in a better position to provide for and nurture a child?   Just that you are asking the question tells me that you know it would be better for you, and for the child to wait.<br>  <br>  Another thought.  I had my first child at 26.  I can think back to when I was an adult BEFORE I had kids.  I value those memories, and don't feel like I missed out on anything.  If I had had kids as a teenager, I'd wonder what I missed out on.<br>  <br>  I guess if you are already pregnant, that changes everything.|`|OGdD2bO8aa	If you're already pregnant then you have a lot of preparing to do if you're not...<br>  Did you know it costs an average (I think more) of 11000 a year to support a baby? Believe me I have 3 and I'm only 23 BUT I have a wonderful career and I make over 40k, my husband also works and were MARRIED. <br>  Please do not even think about relying on the "county" we are in a recession. <br>  Graduate choose a career get some sort of degree or certificate THEN go from there. Although I could never imagine my life without my children I have put my goals to the side for them because I LOVE them. <br>  It is very hard no matter how 'aww how cute' it may look. Please think before you make this type of decission BUT IF you're already pregnant start night school and get a job. It starts before the baby comes...|`|rQCKmnwMaa	I got pregnant a couple months before i turned 16, I'm 30 weeks along now! I'm really excited && happy now, at 1st I was nervous about what my family/parents would think but they were all supportive. So if your parents are supportive then I say GO FOR IT!! [It's important to have your boyfriend there for you too!] It's really kewl to feel the baby you created moving around && i'm looking forward to holding him. I don't regret it. PS- my mom also had me when she was 16 && she doesn't regret it either. Good luck on whatever you do! =]]|`|Ga7rI488aa	I don't mean to have a straight answer on these types of things, but NO<br>  THAT IS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION AT YOUR AGE!<br>  YOU'RE NEVER EVER GOING TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE AT LIFE, SO MAKE THIS ONE RIGHT! You have sooooo much time to have kids, etc. Don't rush into things! You will regret the burden of it. If you're already pregnant, then the right thing to do is to keep him/her and raise them with unconditional love, like any parent should. But trust, me don't do this to yourself. You have so many things to experience before you reach adulthood, and having a baby is a part of adulthood|`|LfuTTt1Caa	At your age i really wanted a baby with the love of my life. We even cried when i found out that i wasnt pregnant when i thought i was. now i realize what it would have been like if i had of had a baby. and at that young you just have so much more of your life ahead of you. it might seem like you really want the baby, i mean they will light up your life. But under age its just a really bad idea. the baby takes up all your time and you wont really have time for anyone else. for sure you have to have people there to help you take care of the baby. Doing it alone is nearly impossible. It seems a very bad idea, because in 2 years you could feel completely different and rrelize its better that you dont have a kid. just think about future and what you will be limited with.<br>  <br>  if you do have a baby though, you will never regret it later on. because the love of your life will come out of the situation,... your child!|`|a42DFZHtaa	its good to kno those things..<br>  <br>  my bestfriend shay is pregnant right now at 16<br>  though she doesent kno who her baby daddy is she's still having her baby girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  make sure you're only involved wth one guy.. so he cant say he isnt' the baby's father.<br>  <br>  about telling your parents goes..<br>  make sure you and your mom/or/dad have "the sex talk"<br>  i kno most teens dont like it you should have that talk.<br>  it will put less pressure on you when u tell your parents you're pregnant. if u do choose to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  make sure your parents meet the guy and like him.<br>  its very important your parents approve of your baby daddy.<br>  <br>  <br>  my bestfriends mother took it well.. only because she is about to be out of school in one more year.. and gets good grades and is very responsible and mature for her age.<br>  <br>  well thats all i got i hope that info. helped..<br>  good luck! oh yeaa and dont tell the world that your pregnant..<br>  it might mess up your reputation at school.|`|FswuiOIjaa	Please,please, Please, For the love of god, DONT have a baby.   You are nowhere near mature enough.  You and Mr. Wonderful dont make nearly enough money to support a baby.  After a year or so of being a daddy Mr. wonderful will take off.  On top of all that you wont have any kind of social life.  Or you'll have a Great social life but you kid will be neglected.|`|8B3mlWfCaa	well hopefully you have a house, car, license, money to provide for the child and arent planning on relying on someone else to pay for all of these things and transport you around! pfft|`|PnXkTvVraa	I had my daughter (who would have been 7 now but she passed away) at 18, yes I regret it.

5axGfFofaa	You have to know what day you ovulated to calculate luteal phase.<br>  Luteal Phase= Days of Cycle - Day of ovulation<br>  They will vary.  Mine is 15 days with 30-32 day cycle.
o28iO6FKaa	Hi there,<br>            like the answers b4 me there are definitely heaps of reasons for late periods. Stress is a big one, diet or hormones. If you have not had sexual intercourse together she wont be pregnant by you. But if she has had sexual intercourse with someone else then yes its a very real possibility. To stop the worrying, the best thing to do is talk to her and either see the doctor or buy a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Stay safe|`|IGcS9K62aa	If second is oral, what is third?!?!?!|`|ORluWHGAaa	No. you don't get pregnant from oral sex. <br>  But if you guys do have sex use a condom.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Oral sex cannot lead to pregnancy all on its own. Sperm needs to have come in contact with or around the vaginal opening. Take some sex ed courses before engaging in sexual activities, okay?<br>  <br>  Other things that can make a period late include:<br>  -Stress<br>  -Poor diet<br>  -Massive weight gain<br>  -Massive weight loss<br>  -Lots of strenuous physical activity (such as athletics)<br>  -Typical irregularity-at 15, it's not entirely likely that she's 'regular' yet, in terms of her cycle|`|KdgceJ95aa	If you have not actually "done it" they she is not pregnant, at least not by you.<br>   Hormones can cause her period to be late. Be careful you can still get STDs from oral. Yuck!|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	If you haven't had sex then she's not pregnant, or at least not by you.  <br>  <br>  Periods can be late for lots of reasons, like stress.
vygYFdsSaa	There are confidentiality rules. She could have talked to the doctor. I'm not sure if a urine scan for her kidneys would test hCG levels. Since it has been a month, it sounds like she's just freaking. Teenage girls invent pregnancy scares all of the time. Tell her to just take a d*** test if shes so worried!!! Have you been having unprotected sex? Everything will probably be fine, but have her take a test so you both can stop worrying.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	They would have checked for pregnancy automatically. Chances are she's not. Home pregnancy test is about 15 bucks. Use a condom in the future. If she isn't ready to tell her mom she might be pregnant, she isn't ready to get pregnant. Condoms are cheaper than diapers, just so you know.|`|wVTcifSraa	ok i am a doctor & usually when we do urine analysis no matter what the prob is we even do a pregnancy test sometimes so dat thing is clear she is not pregnant<br>  don't worry she is just worried & dats y all stomach cramps & nausea<br>  no period miss dat is another thing dat its safe...<br>  <br>  anyways she needs more  attention from u & extra care so she gets over the anxiety...|`|bTMlaynYaa	if she hasnt missed her period and everyting with the period is going along like usual, like noting out of the ordinary<br>  then no shes not prego<br>  y dont u guys just buy a pregnancy test and c rite away if yes or no?|`|y5DAfNtHaa	maybe she's just freaking you out..|`|fa7ah6gqaa	go buy her a home preg. test. but shes prob. just being dramatic
d6kekKgeaa	if it was two weeks from the first day of your last period - give or take a couple days - then yes, pre-c. can get you pregers. - though i have heard of woman getting preggers from having sex on their actual period, thinking that they were safe. you should be far enough for an ept, but if your hormones arnt high enough yet, you could still get a false neg too.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Duh, yes, of course.|`|KdgceJ95aa	Yes but it might take a while to show up on the preg test.|`|6JAXZlG5aa	Depends if ur ovulating at the time n pre *** does contain sperm u have to wait till your next period to see if your pregant|`|1uz0ngfkaa	yes|`|T3nvME3Daa	why aren't you making sure your man wears a condom?
b0dd8940d1da49473968c1f70e126000aa	Please don't suppliment with formula as someone suggested. Your body produces milk according to how much your baby is nursing from you. So if you suppliment with formula your body will produce less milk!<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question everything sounds okay with you. Your baby will have growth spurts and drink more and your body will compensate for it. Unless your baby is screaming like he/she is still hungry he is satisfied. As they get older they won't fall asleep after every nursing session.<br>  <br>  Keep nursing when your baby is hungry and you both will be just fine.|`|lKXtfYFxaa	Your breast were engorged and you probably are associating that fullness with your milk supply (I did the same thing).<br>  <br>  As long as your baby has enough wet/dirty diapers and is gaining weight he's getting enough. I would always squeeze my nipples after my baby was done to see if any milk comes out.  That way you can tell if he's draining them dry.  <br>  <br>  Your milk supply is supply & demand so you could always pump while he's napping to make your body produce more milk.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	If you are nursing on demand you are most likely not drying up.  3 weeks is a typical time for a growth spurt.  I found that the first 3 weeks of nursing it seemed like my baby constantly wanted to eat.  It is normal.  <br>  <br>  You can boost supply by:<br>  1. Nurse on demand or every 2 hours<br>  2. Drink plenty of water <br>  3. Oatmeal or even Oatmeal cookies<br>  4. Fenugreek<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Don't give up!  The best way to solve issues with nursing is usually to nurse more often!  It gets easier and when the baby is through with the growth spurt you will notice he goes longer between feedings.  But be ready for the 6 week growth spurt!|`|pB1oXLz5aa	if your still breast feeding your not drying up. Your baby is just growing but either way you could probably try supplementing with formula. just make sure you use the formula with dha's|`|7YoOBGMMaa	I remember going through a lot of the same things with my first!  Esp the thought that "he must not be getting enough b/c he's not not falling asleep like he used to".  Though I can't attest to how old my son was when I had that thought (maybe it wasn't as early as 2.5 weeks), keep in mind that your baby's going to grow, and their awake time will not always be the same, so their sleepiness after feeding is NOT a reliable indicator of whether or not they're full.<br>  <br>  You noticed that he's had signs of a growth spurt.  It can take several days (even a week, my lactation consultant said) for your body to step up to the increased demand.  It doesn't mean that he's "not getting enough"... it just means that you may continue to nurse him more often for several more days before you guys get into another rhythm.<br>  <br>  Also, try to let him nurse on one side for as long as he wants before switching sides.  This allows him to drain you more effectively (therefore getting the fattier hindmilk that keeps him fuller).<br>  <br>  I went through a lot of ups & downs with my first, worrying about many little things I would notice during nursing sessions.  I also worried that any fussiness during a nursing session meant that he wasn't getting enough milk, but that's not necessarily true, either.<br>  <br>  The only really (objective), reliable factors to look at in terms of whether or not he's getting enough milk are:<br>  1) is he having wet diapers<br>  2) is he gaining weight<br>  <br>  The previous suggestions of nursing on demand or more often, staying hydrated, and eating oatmeal are good.  I would caution against taking Fenugreek for now.  There's nothing "wrong" if you wanted to try, but you may find that in a couple days you'll fall into a new rhythm.  And if you try taking Fenugreek, you won't know if your "new rhythm" is because it would have just happened, or if it was because of the Fenugreek.  Plus, in my experience, I think it just made me feel like I "needed" it, or worried that my milk supply wasn't otherwise adequate, which didn't help my post-partum anxiety!<br>   <br>  My guess is that he's probably doing fine, and so are you!  I also realized that I worried much less when I got some more sleep.  Good luck!  And congratulations!
JQZDCcyQaa	Ok, would you like to drink lying on your back?????? I know I dont. Babies should be feed slightly elevated in the nook of your arm on your lap, not on the floor. Sheesh|`|Vw1GzleKaa	as far as the baby its a bit sideways  while drinking the milk i guess i dnt matter where its at,but just not lying on its back completly cause i can choke on the food|`|18mNGi1uaa	The head has to be tilted up, so lying on the floor is a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Besides choking and coughing on the milk, it can run back up oddly and cause ear infections if the baby's lying flat.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|b0dd8940d1da49473968c1f70e126000aa	You should elevate him/her slightly to avoid gas and choking. But holding your baby close to you is even better. It will give you both a bonding experience.|`|accee57f3c7d9675579a1fa5e6c02e93aa	Sit them up on your lap holding their head in one hand and the bottle in the other.
3gToWPZdaa	With how short of a time you've been together, of course people would talk negatively if it turns out you're pregnant. Hell, my husband and I had been together three years and people still spoke negatively of our pregnancy. But if you are pregnant, you two will just have to work harder to prove everyone wrong. And remember, it doesn't matter what anyone else says. It's about you, him, and the baby. <br>  <br>  (Side note: If it turns out you are, you two would definitely be wise to get a place of your own ASAP so that your parents don't get the illusion that they have control over the situation)<br>  <br>  You aren't silly for being happy. Just because it was an accident doesn't mean the two of you have to be upset. If you're pregnant, you'll be bringing a new life into this world and taking on one of the greatest roles; being a mother. It's very easy to get happy and excited over that.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	first fine out if you are or not.. and if you are, there really isnt anything you can do about it now, so why be upset?  i think being happy is the best way to feel and hopefully everyone in your life will feel the same way.  dont stay apart though.. at least move in together, because this baby deserves to have both parents around.  good luck!|`|vygYFdsSaa	How could you be silly for being happy about a pregnancy?! Many women are overjoyed when they hear the news. My pregnancy was accidental like yours, but after the initial freak-out, my boyfriend and I became very happy and excited. Never think that it's weird to be happy about it.|`|sgMno1PRaa	No thats completly normally, everyone worries what people are going to say, we shouldnt have to - but theres always someone. And its good that your happy!!<br>  Go and get a test or go to the doctors to have it confirmed!!!|`|wVTcifSraa	congrats firstly<br>  <br>  ok but first things first get a test done sometimes people think its pregnancy but it isnt just get a urine test...<br>  secondaly if u have concieved & by ur happiness i know the guy also loves u a lot take a stand & ask him to pop the ques get married so that will shut up all the gossips plus no 1 can guess was it before marriage convieve or after...i mean a baby is expect 7-9 months so dats sorted out<br>  next u need to tell ur parents find decent jobs pool in & buy ur own appartment(if u dnt want 2 live wid his parents dat is) chart out every single detail together talk & discuss<br>  <br>  all the best for the future|`|1uz0ngfkaa	HEY! So my story is that i moved out of my parents house to go in a different province and i met this boy the day i got into town, We started to see each other and soon decided to date, i would say about 5 months in i got pregnant so i new him for about 7 months.  We also sort out our problems easily and get along very well.  We now have a 2 week old son and were so happy, Everyone around us have been supporting us ( we also both work at the same place ) and co-workers have been more the excited and been so supportive (its almost like they were pregnant with us all along) Anyways, all this to say i now have a son at 19 years old and very well set.  AND SO HAPPY<br>  <br>  Your right that its really scary to tell others at first but im sure they are all going to be very supportive.  There will be the one person whos going to give you a hard time because some may just be getting used to the new relationship but prove them wrong, Congradulationss|`|8YDCrZ4Paa	First, It's not silly to be happy you are going to have a child. You feel how you feel and that's it. But your relationship is still in a very young stage, where everything about one another is exciting and new. Maybe you are glad because you feel like a child will strengthen your bond and make you love each other more, but I assure you, reality is going to hit you very soon. You should go to the pharmacy immediately and purchase a pregnancy test to be sure. If you are, than you've got a lot to think about and a very important task of preparing for a complete life overhaul, and if you are not, thank goodness you were lucky this once, and be mature and responsible by using protection every single time. You are not ready to have a child|`|IGcS9K62aa	You're very late so stop being irresponsible and take a test. Then take your feelings from there.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	its ok to be happy about a baby--just that our society acts like children are burdens

3427eebd84da66693a5d9d29a3fcc54caa	I would retest with first morning urine.<br>  <br>  I've been TTC for two months now with colmid and I'm on the 2WW; 7 dpo.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust.|`|3p0QBNpwaa	I would wait a few days and take another test. <br>  <br>  I had spotting around the time my period was due(and mistook it for a period) and I was pregnant!
qHog8OWXaa	if she is getting the pains but her period does not come in a few days it'd be a good idea to get a pregnancy test. the whole reason i took a test when i was pregnant was because of the very same reason! there is every chance that her period is about to start though so don't get too scared just yet.|`|Vuewo6TAaa	most likely shes misscarrying|`|5lswCYcoaa	i would be scared. don't sound too good.|`|ikG37bALaa	take a blood test|`|syQmxRrBaa	she could have an ovarian cyst. They're very painful and common, especially with pregnancy. if the pain is really that bad and she has insurance, she should go to the E.R. because if it's a different pain it could be a number of things depending on where the pain is. For most women when they're pregnant they experience cramping like they're going to start their period and then don't.  But it's usually not a sever cramping. Just normal. Since she's a week late, a pregnancy test is definitely a good idea.

391855c50047ff87f5a7ed00e1cc8b87aa	Hola <br>  Debe de comensar desde bebe. Cuando lo banen dile por su nombre las partes del cuerpo. Todos los dias le debes decir los ninos tienen pene y las nenas tienen vulva y son diferente. Preguntale que el tiene y que tiene mama. Por que son diferente y para que se usan no le dijas cosas que no son, por pena. Llamale por su nombre correcto. Le puedes comprar litertura y entre los dos discutirlos. Hay unos libritos que los dan los sicologos infantiles pueden ayudar en mucho. Busca en internet. Sobre todo vas dando confianza entre tu relacion de padre e hijo. Creeme es un paso un poco incomodo.

4JuwXJrEaa	Even though it is a pain to get up at 5am to feed your baby, that is what I think you need to do.  If you get up and give him his bottle and then put him back to bed when he is finished, he will probably sleep another couple of hours.  You just don't want him to have the bottle while he is in his crib b/c he will fall asleep while drinking it and then the milk will sit on his teeth while he sleeps and give him cavities.  You don't want to substitute pedialyte for milk b/c he needs all of his nutrition.  It is important for his bones and his brain.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	No, that's not what it is for. It's meant as a REPLACEMENT for minerals and to restore electrolyte balance when a child is ill.|`|AA11123539	okay....I think the answer is to feed your baby while holding him.  You can still let him hold his bottle.  Pedialite shouldn't be used unless your baby is dehydrated.  He is only six months old, he needs all his formula, you should not dilute it.  My baby's drank milk in their bottles until they were eighteen months and no teeth problems whatsoever.|`|K455nsxaaa	First of all Pidialite is something you will give a baby when they are sick and need it to be hydrated.  You don't give it to him just for the fun of it.  Second nobody told you to have a child if you didn't know the responsibilities that come with it.  Also you must pick up your child to feed him, he is only 6 months and you also have to burp him, he can't burp himself.  So get up from that bed and get away from the computer and take care of your baby.|`|NmoTFTSEaa	I don't know who is informing you ,but they are wrong.<br>  The first thing your baby should be having when waking<br>  up in the morning is a nice warm bottle of formula.<br>  Take him out of the crib, feed & burp him,then put him back in bed.|`|lmPu22Tvaa	i think i would rather give him water that is my personal choice it does no damage to teeth. However i would be scepticle of giving them a bottle while laying down in fear he/she would choke on it. Im not real sure have you tried just a binky?|`|AA10802630	I don't understand why you are dilluting anything?  I have 5 children, and I gave them all a bottle at night full of milk.  Of course, I breast-fed for the first 8 months until they got both top and bottom teeth, but after that they had bottles.  None of my children have any problem with their teeth.  I think you need to stop listening to old wives tales and get a good book on the development of your child.  I suggest a book written by American Pediatrics called Caring for your baby and young child Age Birth to 5 years.  Parenting does not come with a manual, but I found this book very helpful to erase all the rumors people tell you about how you SHOULD raise your child...|`|bd998c40bbdf25cf87937b8bd1060a8caa	Do you mean formula? A six month old baby cannot have milk yet. You should not give it to him until he is at least 12 months. As for him waking up, you are only 'feeding' into this. You are keeping this habit going. Stop giving him anything and he will (and must) learn to put himself back to sleep. You are continuing to allow him to wake up in search of something to eat.|`|pbNKP0cDaa	You can keep diluting the pedialite until it is just water.  I did this with my son and juice at night until it was a whole bottle of water.  I would keep lowering the juice every night until it was just water.

c75c17c7d958a8f02473ad1c8de3bae5aa	Creo que tu bebé no tiene problemas del habla, sólo necesita más interacción con ustedes (su familia) y con demás ni?os. El hecho de que ella te responda sólo cuando le vas a dar algo es normal, es su manera de obtener las cosas y en cierta forma su manera de interactuar. Y lo que dijo el pediatra es recomendable, porque los ni?os antes de los dos a?os pueden confundir los idiomas a los que está expuesto. Y lleva poco tiempo de haberle cambiado la tv inglés por la espa?ola, dale un tiempo y sigue en consulta con el pediatra. Paciencia y mucho amor. éxito.|`|KuXgqli9aa	entre 1 a 2 a?os|`|d810945d5a79cbac14b7a0697a73466baa	hasta los 2 a?os|`|4PrK30Vvaa	Probablemente estás anticipando sus deseos. Las mamás solemos hacer eso.  Adriana tiene que aprender que la forma en que se está comunicando, no funciona ya. Ella oye bien, por lo que tu cuentas, y también es capaz de articular palabras complicadas como su nombre o galleta. Cuando notes que quiere algo, no se lo des a la primera, dale algunas opciones y finje que no la entiendes. Pregunta por ejemplo ?quieres esta o la otra?, para "obligarla" a tratar de hablar, sin llegar tampoco a frustrarla demasiado. Cuando intente decir algo demuéstrale lo contenta que estas por eso. Lo de que no comparte no es importante. Es normal a su edad, y más si no convive con ni?os.  Me preocupa más lo de que no siga instrucciones simples, ?qué dice de eso el médico? Volviendo al lenguaje, tengo dos sobrinos que no hablaron nada hasta los tres a?os. Y son perfectamente normales. Y no, no la dejes que trepe sola con otros ni?os. Adriana todavía es una bebé.|`|e2kiY5jOaa	No te preocupes es normal. Con respecto a las instrucciones, vos tenés que inculcarle y ense?arle.<br>  Por ejemplo mi nene m?as chico cuando pedía algo se?alaba con el dedo; entonces con mi esposa no le dábamos nada, y cuando agarramos lo que él quería le decíamos que era; de esa manera él fue llamando las cosas por su nombre y a relacionar las cosas. Todos los ni?os no tienen el mismo tiempo para aprender, algunos tardan más que otros. Cuando te llama a vos ?Como te llama? sea como sea cuando lo haga vos le debes ense?ar y decirle MAMA o PAPA para que ella de tanto escucharlo se acostumbre al sonido de las palabras hasta que empiece ella tambien a decirlas. Un beso y suerte<br>  Tené paciencia... tu hija se lo merece...|`|uDmvvdBsaa	Si dice alguna palabra, no creo que sea muy grave. Piensa que está asimilando 2 idiomas al mismo tiempo..<br>  A los 3 a?os los ni?os hablan casi tan bien como un adulto, con claras excepciones como la adquisición de la "r" o "rr" que muchos la pronuncian mal hasta los 5 a?os. Aun hay tiempo..<br>  Sigue estimulándola en casa, acompa?a la acción en todo momento..<br>  Ej:<br>  Vas a darle un vaso de agua y le decís:<br>  - Que rico!, mami te va a dar agua..(le mostras todo y lo nombras, pero acompa?ando..)<br>  - agarrà el vasito!..mmm esta rico?<br>  -te gusta el agua que te dio mami?<br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva. <br>  <br>  En cuanto a la audición..probà esto:<br>  Se necesitan 2 adultos. Juga con la beba y que alguien a quien ella no vea, o sea, que este detrás de la ni?a..haga un sonido(ej. cascabeles, campanita, pandereta, tambor, etc) hacia uno de los lados (derecha o izquierda de la ni?a) pero que no lo vea.<br>  Si ella cambia de actitud, frena su actividad, o gira su cabecita..quiere decir que localizó la fuente de sonido.<br>  Podes utilizar materiales diversos para emitir sonidos desde los mas agudos a los mas graves. No hagas mas de 3 en un mismo momento porque los ni?os se condicionan, y puede ser que no lo hayan oído pero igualmente buscan con la mirada por acostumbramiento.<br>  Espero que te sirva!!

Te recomiendo la lleves a un psicólogo infantil que se especializan en esos casos. Puede tener problemas auditivos, déficit de atención, autismo,etc. Un examen psicométrico puede ayudar a determinar si existe algún problema.  Y la etapa en que se encuantra tu ni?a el cuanto al desarrollo de sus destrezas motoras.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a las caricaturas en inglés, no creo que sea ningún problema. Tengo 2 ni?os, en mi casa todos dominamos el inglés pero se habla espa?ol constantemente. En la etapa de tu ni?a son como esponjitas y absorben todo, si ustedes hablan espa?ol en la casa, ella debe entender.  Mis hijos dominan ámbos idiomas aunque tienen mayor vocabulario en ingles, gracias a las caricaturas y a la educación bilingue.<br>  <br>  Es importante para fomentar las destrezas sociales básicas de los ni?os, el que compartan con otros; no se si trabajas, ya que una alternativa es el cuido en un lugar donde hayan otros ni?os de edades similares ó un poquito mayores. Este lugar debe ser operado por una persona de tu entera confianza. Los ni?os emulan lo que hacen y dicen los demás y es un proceso importante en el desarrollo.<br>  <br>  Busca ayuda profesional para que salgas de dudas, ya que en caso de que exista algún problema, si se detecta a edad temprana puede solucionarse con terapia y no esperar a que llegue a su edad pre-escolar y confronte problemas de aprendisaje.<br>  <br>  Suerte y un beso a Adriana.|`|237f26351c3b9246c4f1b34a5b1c7fafaa	debes llevarla a un terapista del habla el te dira yo pase lo mismo con mi hijo cuando tenia casi los 3 anos y le dieron terapia,mejoro mucho y todos los casos no son iguales te aconsejo q la lleves no esta de mas.|`|HIdOwP0jaa	Hola,te puedo decir que de 14 meses en adelante puedes darte cuenta si tu nino(a) tiene problemas del habla. por lo general  lo reflejan despues de 24 meses.Te aconsejo , si vives en Estados Unidos, busques ayuda con la agencia Child Care Council en la ciudad donde vivas.

Hablenle de todo, de lo que esta haciendo, ademas es de mucha importancia que si quieres forzarla de alguna manera a que hable, no les des las cosas que quiera cuando las se?ale haz que te diga como es por ejemplo la mamila, si la se?ala tu dile "mamila",  y haz que vea tu boca para que vea como se articula , si tu hija lo intenta, dasela pero repitele si mamila, y aplaudele, y asi continuamente con lo que te pida. vERAS QUE POCO A  POCO IRA TENIENDO MAS PALABRAS EN SU REPERTORIO<br>  <br>  a lo de la television no tiene nada que ver, ya que los ni?os tiene un maypr nivel de aprendizaje y la verdad es la edad en que pueden aprender un idioma aparte del suyo, ademas si es importante que socialize con otros ninos ya que asi fomentara mejor desarrollo, aunque con adultos tambien es bueno, pero platiquenle cosas, a su ni?a<br>  <br>  Ademas si esto no es sufiente y te tranquiliza mas acude con un especilista y te mandara hacer un estudio para los oidos, ademas de una evaluacion exhaustivo.

The only trouble I ever had really with my tilted uterus is going to the DR for my yearly woman's check up.|`|c7f2057ca2950a73fb0c359e6fc4d29eaa	I CANT get pregnant because of this reason. My moms mom had the same problem but was very fertile, 4 girls and 1 boy. Its different for every woman,  but good luck ok?|`|e3d6754da4a5a64f0cc6a0851793fd3eaa	the doctors  told my aunt she couldn't never have kids because she has a tilted uterus. but some how she has 3 kids now 2 boys and a girl. if that can happen for her I'm sure it can happen for you to. good luck.

During your cycle the walls of the uterus become thickened preparing for a fertilized egg.  The period occurs when no fertilized egg attaches to the uterine wall.  The period is the thickened uterine lining washing out  Ovulation takes place when an egg matures, and breaks out of the ovary, so to speak. Really the two things are very different.
c4e7f44d6d23c10fe9417ffdbbbe0fe3aa	No, But you should exercise because obesity has alot to do with fertility.|`|AA12215102	I don't know what you are asking for certain.<br>  <br>  A lack of exercising does not mean you will have trouble getting pregnant.  Being overweight is a factor, definitely, but that isn't necessarily caused by lack of exercise.  Those who exercise too much can have a hard time too.
AA12266762	ok her eit is, i had one after my second and it was fine, until i got my first period. the cramps were unbareable, the bleeding lasted for 8 days( i used to flow for only 4), and i hated having to check it all the time after a cycle, after sex, blah blah blah.  any way i had it for 2 1/2 years. hey it kept me safe from a third.  i dealt with it.  if the bleeding and cramping is that bad they can give you something to relieve it.  Anyway, i just had it removed today because we are trying for #3.  and after this one, I would probably get the IUD again.|`|100c6ed275df5057a12a93aa22947a9aaa	My wife got the iud after our second child.

So i got sniped after 3rd was born and i get checked every 3 yrs to make sure it doesnt grow back :)|`|AA11179510	I have never had one but I have heard if they come out (people usually say the male can feel it) then you are very susceptible to getting pregnant. Ask your doctor about signs that it is not working.|`|FwQ6ptiGaa	Well i had a copper IUD for about 1yr1/2 and it was the worst thing i had ever experienced. It made me extremely sick and tired all the time and messed up my periods along with failing, the thing is it may really depend on ur gyno and if they know how to insert it properally, so maybe it's something you need to be sure your going to talk about throughly and make sure it's what you want so it doesn't harm you.

I would suggest a pregnancy test. Most home pregnancy tests allow you to test 4-5 days before your period so if your period is irregular and you don't know exactly when it will start one of these tests may be better. However, the earlier you test, the less accurate the test is, so if you get a neg.- and your period still doesn't start I would take another one a couple days later.|`|ce26874f754f2230952befae88994f91aa	I hope you are. i am hoping the same for me.  my last cycle was on the 21st of Dec and it only lasted 2 days.

Not because of the cramps, sore breasts or frequent urination.  You were having unprotected sex during the most fertile period of your cycle.  If you don't want to be pregnant, you shouldn't have played Russian roulette.
c582246cd8318a2e207bda37f4299a0caa	That's kind of an odd thing to hear because once you get pregnant, your doctor doesn't really want you to be doing some seriously stressing activities like... the Olympics. The only possibility I can imagine is that being pregnant increases your body's blood volume thus giving your body more oxygen to use as energy.|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	thats insane, they test you , they wouldnt let you compete pregnant. they dont want the legal mess if you lost the baby.|`|nmhnsWklaa	As long as you don't put your body through undue stress, the baby will be fine.  If you are overweight before you get pregnant, then don't overdo it.  If you are  a gym rat before you get pregnant, as long as your doctor clears you, you can do just about anything (no heavy weights)
AA11454006	I had the exact same problem. My doctor admitted me into the hospital and from there I was airlifted to a hospital that could care for me and the baby if it was born at 28 weeks. I was giving steroid shots to help mature the baby's lungs and I take procardia XL twice a day, I have been in the hospital for a little over a month now ( a little over 32 weeks along) and the nurses here monitor me and watch me carefully, there has been a couple of times for the need of a brethine shot to stop contractions but I'm still hanging in. You will be fine, I'm sure your doctor has put you on some sort of bed rest?<br>  <br>  *** I would atleast call my doctor o see about getting a steriod shot, because that will help your baby's lungs mature as well as help him/her grow faster. I would check into it a little bit, but if your doctor thinks that is fine then maybe it is, but my doctor put me on complete bedrest because he doesn't want to put the baby in danger, because if you think about it, everytime your standing, your just putting more pressure on your cervix. The Best of Luck to you and your baby, hang in there!

AA11634352	I highly doubt it.  Sometimes our breasts just leak for no reason.  When my daughter stopped nursing at 9 months, my breasts never really stopped making milk.  If you would check, you could get acouple of drops out.  That lasted up until I got pregnant with my son, 2 years later.  He stopped nursing at 6 months.  Both of them on their own.  ANd he's 9 months now, and I'm still making milk.  It's just a natural thing.  We usually don't notice it unless we are unsure about pregnancy and start really noticing little things.

Again, I highly doubt you are pregnant.|`|AA12131391	I hate it when girls ask these questions, coz how are people over the net supposed to know if you're pregnant?? they can't, just take a test, that's be only advice you'll every get to know for sure.|`|8f35c8a73963bcb658886820c25f622daa	It could be that you are pregnant if the following has occured:<br>  You have had sex in the past several weeks.<br>  <br>  Get another pregnancy test if you are in doubt.<br>  Occasionally women's breasts will just lactate, and sometime's men's.   <br>  Do note, if you're leaking a red substance, or it's particularly foul smelling, comes from a hole or growth other than your nipple, you might want to see a doctor about it.|`|ae1996cf84644ac24d307a0ff211a723aa	get a blood test for pregnancy,  the bleeding can go on for the whole 9 months of a pregnancy and that was rather short and the leaky breast was it a goldish color?could be the start of the colostrum.|`|dbac00ef453f1bdccf468d02d55b502aaa	You could be pregnant, but it's not likely if you have not been sexually active since before you got your period. To be sure, take another home test. False negatives are far more likely than false positives, so if it shows positive, you're pregnant. If it still says negative and you want to be sure, a blood test at your doctor's office or planned parenthood should be definitive. Good luck!|`|eaa7f80ba6327232f0749a8a526c9a04aa	see your doc asap ok|`|c5b3941e7b2b781dcf06189415e017d2aa	This sounds more like a hormonal problem than you being pregnant. My wife did bleed when she was first pregnant and we thought it was a period.  However, the leaking would not occur till later in the pregnancy.  In other words, you wouldn't have hormone levels high enough to cause this that soon into the pregnancy.  I would think you weren't pregnant and that you have something else going on.

I tried putting him on his back, but no luck. Not only that, he was colicky, so getting him to sleep at all was very tough without me holding him and rocking him.  There were many times I had to hold him while he slept.  But when he did, he was definitely on his side.  I never heard such a thing about the bones.

It has a foam triangle on both sides of baby and keeps the on their side. I used with both my kids, they had reflux horrably and I wasn't comfortable with them sleeping on their backs.

6817b4874b138193b62958d0d5bae184aa	Daycare specifically, I don't know.  But I know you can get assistance from the government if you are low income.|`|AA10624857	Finding subsidized daycare will require you to make a number of phone calls and fill out a lot of paperwork.  There are several options that I am aware of.  You can contact your state's Department of Human Resources and inquire about government assistance.  This is often the most difficult money to obtain as many states have stringent rules governing this money and the income level requirement is quite high (in my opinion).  Another option is to contact your local Child Care Referral Service.  Look in the yellow pages of your phone book for this contact agency.  There are often "scholarships" available for low income families to help pay for child care.  If you don't qualify for a scholarship, this agency can also help you be in touch with licensed child care homes and centers in your area that match your needs.  Ask your employer if they will help with child care costs.  Often businesses will offer this perk, but don't advertise it.  You may find a child care center who offers fees based on a sliding scale.  Frequently, but not always, these centers are located in areas of large cities with a high population of low income families and may be run by a religious organization, but again, not always.  You may want to consider a childcare home instead of a center as they are generally less expensive.  If your child's father is at all involved in his/her life, enlist his help in covering child care costs, ask for the courts to assist in this matter as well.  If you are a single mom because of a divorce, you will likely have a court appointed "friend of the court" laison who may be another resource in helping you find ways to secure more affordable child care.|`|821f61c1457efa2df76c9066aa821299aa	Go to the site below, the ads on the left and at the top seem to have some listings for this sort of thing!|`|06cf85030826b08cc64d25f700ad54deaa	In Florida we have this place called the Childcare Association where they adjust your daycare payments on a sliding scale according to your income.

In the state where I live you have to be low income.  You can find out by asking the daycare or others where to go for assistance.  They would know if they accept government assistance.|`|b84d3a90ab40e59cc1e01cbc02bb49a5aa	remember, you get what you pay for.  you want cheap daycare, you just may get it.  try a local church that has a school...attend it first.  see if you get a good feel for it.  DO NOT HIT THE YELLOW PAGES and look for a daycare.  ask another mother in your area that you may feel comfortable with (coworker, someone you meet at the church).|`|c00070090d9e82b3b9ebd9470d366385aa	I am a stay at home mom, while my hubby works, and I take my son to a County Preschool where they go by your income (I only pay like $6 a week!). All of the Headstarts are free. You have to fall under the category of low income. At our Headstart, they let all kids go but only have like 15 spots for kids that are above income. With daycare, I'm not sure, I know that you can go to you local Scope program (I don't know what they call it from where you live) but they will also go by your income and pay for a lot of your daycare if your income is within their guidelines! Good Luck!|`|9bc496f9c707c59f0febd70417955ca6aa	Since you are a single mother you must go to apply for welfare at the city, you must apply for the whole free works, money food stamps and wic whith the excuse that you are not working and need money then you will not have to pay for daycare because they pay it. Daycare is free whith free food for your children then they will not give you as much money but you get to work and get free food and daycare!...it's weird how women who want to work cant unless you still have money left when you discount the daycare form your small check. but walfare folks get the work huh....my mom has a daycare in California that is why I tell you the truth and how it works.If you have any questions e-mail me!|`|c3d416b3769027df507f96c56d96e01daa	I live in Mississippi and we have programs but the waiting list are to long to even deal with!!!

And also I think you can call the health department and they could let you know what is available to you.  I'm sure there is something that could help you out if nothing else maybe you could find an individual that would keep your child and that would be cheaper that daycare.....|`|d30821145965adf5d1e9459c9f54e5aaaa	Yes contact your local human services office for a listing that you can go and check out yourself they really do have good people in some of the less expensive centers|`|fa4e045201279b9c2de5fdcdfd74ac15aa	go to the dept of human service (dhs) office in your county and ask them!

14f7eeb15cacbd24969803551b9e9e10aa	I don't know if there is a best time. So much depends on the baby and how you feel about leaving him/her. A year is optimal because so many milestones happen in that time. I waited till both my kids could walk because I didn't want to miss their first steps. Finances definitely play a part too. Don't rush back to work if you don't have to. You'll never get that time back with your baby and work will always be around in one form or another. Good Luck.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	When your child starts school.|`|DHz46NJUaa	I went back to work at 2 weeks after.

I feel that your baby's first years which are from when they are first born till they are about 5 i feel you should be there. its when your baby is learning and very curious if your not around to teach them right from wrong who will...your mom you Nanny..no one will get the job done right better than you....also you should go back to work when your body is fully recovered....personally i would take the first three years off then start with all my social life and work but every ones life is different do do whats best for you......|`|VOSGaIANaa	Your smart to be looking into things now.  If your baby will be going to daycare you will want to start researching and interviewing prospective providers.  Depending on the type of work you do you may find that it is not economical to go back to work after you figure in daycare costs, fuel/insurance, dry cleaning costs, eating out, etc.  If you plan to breast feed you will need to know how to pump and store breast milk and get your baby used to the bottle.  <br>  If your company falls under the FMLA you are entitled to 12 weeks of maternity leave and I would recommend taking as much of that as you can afford.  Your doctor will probably recommend that your baby be 6 weeks old and immunized.<br>  Congrats!|`|df448f7cf16903b4104426b7c9b005f4aa	as a parent of two myself, i faced this dilemma when i was pregnant.  their is noone who can really answer this question for you but yourself. its an individual person's choice. as a mum i personally felt difficulty in my children going to daycare untill they were at least 18months old. thats just me though. many working parents have to work pretty soon after having their first or subsequent kids, and place them with reputable child day care nurseries from merely a couple of months old. you can get nurseries who take babies from 0 months or 3 months old up to 5yrs.  i would say if you need to go back to work in order to maintain your home etc then i think its ok.  if you have no alternative then i would say start looking around and put your childs name down on a waiting list with a nursery who would take him/her from 0-3months plus. its not too early to do it, as many parents-to-be are doing it. the question is the finances though?  when kids are 3yrs they get help from the local council's early years department such as a 'nursery education grant' for part-time placements but only with nurseries etc which offer this scheme. i think working parents can get help for childcare costs, but im not sure how old the child needs to be. again you need to contact your local education departments town hall, and ask to speak to the early years section regarding childcare information. they should be able to send you details and listings of all registered childcare and what their costs are. request what financial help is available to you if you go back to work!! as a new parent, also ask the early years department- 'what questions should you ask day care centres' eg security, ratio of carer to babies, feeding, can you drop in without appointment etc' <br>  i would be prepared with all important questions and dont be afraid to ask them!|`|e81fd5dea8e2370ea00dea69534064f7aa	I would say the best time to go back to work is after your docter okays it and you are comfortable going back. You should not feel pushed into going back untill you have found someone who you trust to care for your child and until you are ready to leave your child with another while you work. No amount of money is worth anything if you are feeling guilty about your new little one.|`|ff1f17bc3a675f665885d7114561df24aa	I would recommend 1 year if you can afford that.

CgQiiT3paa	there are plenty of signs that can give you a hint. If you find yourself saying one or more of these things, you should be thinking pregnancy (and running out to the store for a home pregnancy test):<br>  <br>  1. "Ouch! Don't touch my breasts!" Tender breasts and nipples — and I'm talking tender — is one of the first signs many women notice after they conceive. As early as a few days after conception, your breasts may feel full, swollen, and painful to the touch — similar to the feeling you may experience before you get your period but probably a little more pronounced. Make that a lot more pronounced.<br>  2. "Holy dark areolas, Batman!" Not only are your breasts tender, but now it looks like they're changing colors before your eyes! Don't worry — and don't run out to get your eyes checked. It's normal for the area around the nipple (a.k.a. the areola) to darken in hue during pregnancy and even to increase in diameter somewhat. The color change can start as early as a week or two after conception, due to the pregnancy hormones surging through your body. You may also notice an increase and enlargement in the tiny bumps on the areola (called Montgomery's tubercles, in case you need to know).<br>  3. "What's that spot on my underwear?" Some women experience implantation bleeding when — you guessed it — the embryo implants in the uterus. Scanter than a period (and earlier than your expected monthly flow — around five to ten days after conception), implantation bleeding is usually light to medium pink in color (not red, like a period) and is spotty.<br>  4. "Why don't I just move into the bathroom?" The need to pee at an alarming frequency is a symptom of pregnancy that appears on the scene pretty early, usually about two to three weeks after conception.<br>  5. "Get me to a bed — and fast." And not for sex. Extreme fatigue — make that exhaustion — sets in very early in a pregnancy, due in part to the surging hormones in your body. Not to mention all the work your body is doing to jump-start the making-a-baby process.<br>  6. "I think I'm gonna puke." Another reason to move into the bathroom, unfortunately. Nausea and vomiting — those hallmark symptoms of pregnancy — can unfortunately strike a newly pregnant woman pretty early in her pregnancy (though it's more likely to begin around week six).<br>  7. "What's that I smell — and why does it smell so strong?" Do you smell what's on the menu before you've even opened it? Believe it or not, one of the first changes some newly pregnant women report is an increased sensitivity to odors. It could be because of the increasing amount of estrogen in your system during early pregnancy.<br>  8. "I feel like a walking flotation device." Do you have that bloated feeling? You may not be able to differentiate between a preperiod bloat and a pregnancy bloat, but that bloated feeling can creep up on you very early in a pregnancy. Whoopee cushion anyone?<br>  9. "I'm late." No, not for a meeting (though that may happen, too, with all these symptoms getting you distracted). If you've missed a period (especially if your periods generally run like clockwork), you may already be suspecting pregnancy — even before a pregnancy test confirms it.<br>  10. "It says I'm pregnant!" The proof is positive (or, at least, 99 percent positive) on that pregnancy test you can take as early as four days before you expect your period (depending on the brand — though the results will be more positive if you wait until P-day to test). Whether it's a blue or pink line, a positive sign, or a digital readout, if that home pregnancy test says you're expecting — expect some major changes in your body and life during the next nine months (and beyond).<br>  <br>  source: <a href="http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/as..." rel="nofollow">http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/as...</a>|`|8a3da568d050731202110da78d36ac48aa	Just get a test.|`|d537776618198eb71d73279c06a461bbaa	Nausea, sore nipples/breasts, lack of period, headaches, bloating.<br>  These are just a few of the most common.|`|10DjXLlWaa	morning sickness, evening sickness, sickened by the smell of foods, vomiting, and the father sometimes starts craving certain foods. by the way, after a couple of months, a pregnant female has a certain glow to her face. that is when her beauty really shows up|`|cyKSeCw5aa	i never felt anything till my head was in the tolet

5DJcir9saa	First of all, that is adorable what your husband said about not being able to see her with a guy!  LOL  the funniest thing my husband has done with my baby actually happened last night.  He's 4 months old and my husband was teaching him how to high five.  He got a kick out of it everytime my husband would high five him!  So this morning, I held my hand up to him like I was going to high five and he reached up and high fived me!  It was awesome  =)    Oh and another funny thing was when he was about 2 months.  My husband was holding him out in front of him, one hand behind his back and the other under his butt, and making him doing this like pelvic thrust.  My son just looked over at me and gave me this look like, what are you letting him do to me.  I laughed so hard I cried!|`|HF97Rs9qaa	Ou son is due very soon and my fiancee and I are both happy it is a boy.    My fiancee wanted a boy sooooo bad when we got the first ultrasound he asked the Dr like 3 or 4 times if he was sure it was a boy and to re-check.    Then the next 2 ultrasounds my fiancee kept making him check that it was still a boy. And he bragged to everyone about "seeing his little pecker" lol.    He was also really cute when we were shopping for baby stuff, he got really excited over it and was talking to all the pregant women in the babies r us and asking them what they were buying so he could decide if we needed it lol.     And then he bragged about how we got a Recaro car seat to all his friends lol.    Then he came hom with 3 GIANT boxes of baby diapers, they were totally the wrong size because he did not know they have sizes and what size to get a newborn. I thought it was so cute I did not argue and tell him it was the wrong size, I just put it with the other baby stuff.    I am 31 weeks and he has not missed a single baby appointment and he made me preschedule the appontments so he could be there. I went to the Dr.'s alone one early on because I was freaked out that my doppler was not picking up my babies heartbeat and he found out I went alone and acted offended lol.    It is cute and nice seeing him be excited, it makes me happy.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	My husband always says the same thing about wanting our daughter to be a lesbian... too funny! I always figured he was the only one that was that un-politically correct.    It wasn't funny at the time but I can laugh about it now.   My son was born right after Thanksgiving and we were at his moms house eating leftovers. My husband offered me some squash off his finger. Turns out it wasn't squash... It was poop. My hubby had done a "dipstick" test to see if there was poop in the babies diaper, and there was. Fortunately I didn't actually eat it, but I got close enough to completely gross myself out. Everyone else was laughing so hard I had to laugh too.|`|zwctZ812aa	When my son was a few weeks old his dad went to change his diaper for the first time and assured me he didn't nee my help because he knew what he was doing.  It had been a bit so I went over to see what he was doing and he was trying to get to our son's back to secure the tabs.  He had put the diaper on backwards lol.  Gues he needed some help afterall...|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	My hubby was about to take the dog kuma out and we were talking about our son Evan and he said hold on i will be right back I got to take Evan out. LMAO I almost peed my pants I walked over handed the baby to him and told him to make sure he dont come off the leash... THen I went pee cause I was holding it for so long waiting for him to finish eattin.LOL    My hubby also said before Evan came When we went to sams club looking at diaper prices and the lady explained they dont care NB cause people complained.. "why would they complain now we need diapers and its gonna cost us more to buy 500 hundred at wegmans then if we were to buy stock here" i laughed and explained tho i would love our son to stay lil forever they grow up fast.... after her was here my hubby said yeah I am glad i never bought 500 NB diapers LOL|`|cqW3NhqVaa	This really wasnt my SO, or even my baby, but  my boyfriends brother was playing with a friends 3 month  old baby, and she threw up on him. He's not one to let others  get the last laugh so he looked at her momma and said,     "So Stacy, is this 1%, 2%, or tit?"    It was so funny.    Mind you, he is only 17.|`|auNUWQo7aa	We are potty training Logan, so anytime he says pee pee or holds his diaper or makes concentrated faces, I take him to the potty chair and we play potty so that he starts to connect the two. Well just the other day he was doing all of the above signs so I asked him if he needed to go potty. He stood there and looked at me for a second and then ran over to the potty chair and started trying to sit down. I started the usual routine of taking his pants and diaper off and setting him on the potty. He thinks its so much fun usually, but this time he started crying. I left him there for a sec and went across the room to grab him a diaper. He stood up and before I had a chance to get back with the diaper, I saw that same concentrated look on his face. Around him there was already pee on the floor (we have hardwood floors, so no biggy). I ran over to him just in time to pick him up and hover him over the potty chair right before I heard a 'THUNK'. I looked down and saw that what I had caught on the side of the chair had trickled its way down his leg and sock. LOL I ran him over to the couch to clean him off before he got his little hands all in it. Thats when it gets good. The stupid dog decided it would be a good time to come and check what all the noise was about and while I'm stuck at the couch trying to keep from making a poopy mess, Jack (the dog) saw the poopy covered potty chair and went to town smearing it all over the place and walking in the pee tracking it around the house before I was able to catch him and take him outside......    Long story short:   Don't EVER leave a baby diaperless if you don't have another diaper or a mop close by.    The next morning my boyfriend called me at work and told me that Logan had taking his diaper off in the middle of the night and he found him in his crib playing soccer with his poop and what appeared to be CHOCOLATE on his face and hands..... LOL Kris said that he could not stop gagging the whole time trying to clean up that mess.|`|zQQkRR6paa	My husband was about to give my little girl a bath, so as he was carrying her over to the tub he called my name, when I turned to look he was making her butt cheeks 'talk' like Ace Ventura. "Mommy do you have a mint? Some Binaca maybe....."  I swear I laughed til I peed.|`|xK6wehG7aa	My husband hasn't really said anything funny, but he likes to bounce my son and toss him up and play with him. I had just fed Mason and my husband took him and was bouncing him all around. I was like "you probably don't want to do that since he just ate." My husband said, "oh, he'll be fine." Mason was laughing and having a blast. My husband was holding him up over his head making faces at him because it was cracking him up, then all the sudden, BLLAAAHH Mason puked all over my husband's face and in his mouth. I almost wet myself laughing! Mason thought it was pretty funny too. My husband, not so much. I don't think he'll ever be the same! lol He really really hates puke and he got a whole face full of it.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	lol that's funny you don't hear too much about people wanting their kids to be gay lol. i asked my dad what he would do if one of his kids were gay- he's like i can't do anything, i just hope they don't go changing body parts or anything.    my fiance always says he's going to take out son hunting- he's from the south and i'm from up north and the city- i am not into hunting and i am a huge animal fan. i am trying to get son like thatlol

Congratulations!|`|GEfpzUNvaa	maybe maybe not.. call your dr asap and get an appt... blodd test are acurate but those home ones are pretty good too!!! good luck and congrates|`|AR683Nz6aa	nope positive is a positive,|`|m8aqAZgJaa	I was told by my Dr that there are no false positives. The only way that a pregnancy test can come up positive is if it detects the HCG hormone and you only produce it when you are pregnant. Some people may think that they got a false positive when they actually end up having a chemical pregnancy and they think that they just started their period late|`|SRIaRm08aa	Nope you are pregnant.  False positives are extremely rare.  And if you took 3 tests (just like me) and they were all positive then you are pregnant.  Get on prenantal vitamins and call and schedule a visit with your obgyn.|`|NxyTBTMvaa	i took a pregnacy test and it was positive so i went to the hospital to make sure and the nurse said that if it is positive then your pregnant in your case if three of them are positve then you know the answer and if your still unsure go to the hospital or doctor they will send you for blood work to check.|`|HyXGhW8iaa	false negatives...sure  false positives...not a chance!  youll be fine...its the best thing in the world.

l46COY9eaa	Yes, smoking and substance abuse can lower sperm count and affect the quality of sperm. My husband stopped smoking a while back because of our ttc. Here is something I found on the net:    Substance Abuse  Cocaine or heavy marijuana use appears to temporarily reduce the number and quality of sperm by as much as 50%. Sperm actually have receptors for certain compounds in marijuana that resemble natural substances and which may impair the sperms ability to swim and may also inhibit their ability to penetrate the egg.    Smoking.  Smoking impairs sperm count, sperm motility, reduces sperm lifespan, and may cause genetic changes that affect the offspring. Additionally, a 1999 study found that men who smoke have lower sex drives and less frequent sex.    The article also stated other factors, such as heavy metal toxicity, obesety, bicycling, and other factors that figure in with sperm count and mobility. Here is the article if you want to read it:  http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/causes...    Hope that helps with what you need!   :)|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I don't know if it lowers it but it could mutate the sperm if you take drugs such as cocaine and you could have a baby with disabilities or problems...|`|dcNmRPGPaa	not sure. i wouldnt be surprised if it did|`|1OKx4TYpaa	Why would you want to have sex with a degenerate drug user???|`|VjFkybpvaa	not only does it lower your sperm count, it kills brain cells, so if you do these things they will make you impotent and dumb.|`|AA10647819	probably - they're not natural to your body and anything that can cause brain-cell harm will cause other cell harm as well.    if you're trying to conceive, you and your partner should be drug-free.    past use... probably depends on how long ago you/he did the drugs, etc. years ago, it probably won't be an issue. a few weeks ago would be a different story.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Doesn't matter the age. ??|`|horefBCyaa	there isn't a minimum age to buy them...you can buy them whenever.|`|seV3BW62aa	omg. here in Sweden they hand 'em out for free at different places to people of any age... are you sure about the age limit, why the hell would they have an age limit?!|`|AoLgfIaNaa	78  kidding no i dont know|`|pVWk12oOaa	If you're asking this question, you are too young to be having sex.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Any age. There is no law which is good because there is no law saying what age you can have sex at.|`|90nnM99Paa	you can buy them when you're 2 if you wanted|`|HOdblqIkaa	There is no age requirement you can get them at any time|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Its a discretion thing really. Some shops will sell them to you no matter what age you are, other shops will refuse if you can't prove you are old enough to have sex (like in the uk the age of consent is 16 so some shops refuse to sell to under 16's) which in my opinion is quite rightly so. And people may argue that it will be the shops fault then if the girl falls pregnant but actually it isn't because its not like the shop told them to have sex and they were not encouraging it (hence why they refuse to sell the condoms), its the education system (and depending on where you live the sex education system varies, like I've heard american's saying that they don't get enough sex education but in the uk it is the opposite, here kids get given booklets about all the positions and how to do it so is it any wonder that more teenagers are having sex and falling pregnant) and if a shop refuses to sell the teenager condoms then they are blamed for the teenager falling pregnant. The shops are just the scrapegoats though for the people who don't want to take responsibility.|`|avpv7u8saa	there is no age Limit but you should be over 18|`|iLyUgl24aa	I dont think there is an age.....i know back in high school you can get them at the nurses office.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I dont think there is an age limit.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	If the line is there and has ANY color to it (not just a shadow where the line WOULD be if it were there, which is sometimes visible) then it is a positive result.  Congratulations!  The faint line is just because you are still a bit early, and the HCG hormone levels are still low.<br>  <br>  I can tell you, though, that EVERY First Response I took tended to be light.  Even around 13 weeks, when I decided to take the last one in my cabinet just for "fun"-the test line was not as dark as the control line (although it WAS darker than it had been earlier in the pregnancy).<br>  <br>  I pray you have a happy and healthy pregnancy and birth, and a wonderful baby!  Congratulations again!|`|AA11787590	faint line or dark line its a positive. if your still not sure call your dr to get another test done in the office. good luck.|`|Boci5IJ5aa	Don't be lazy and go to accoucheur!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Pnsqdcj6aa	You very well could be.

cjKPEHaFaa	huh?  what's the question?|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	call the fbi ..tell them the cops are not taking this complaint ..because its a small town and they are all abusive buddies|`|VLr3jrutaa	if you live in a country town and your buddy has the cops wrapped around his little finger. Go higher. call the police in you nearest city and tell them everything including the fact that the cops are refusing to help cause they are his mates. You can go above everyones heads in this world and when it comes to your kids if one person doesn't want to listen keep going and make heads roll.  if you go higher there will be a big inquiry into the whole thing and the arrogant cops in your town will be in trouble as well.    GO GET'EM!!!!!    Anyone that touches kids like that should rot in jail|`|SRsFkNBBaa	call a different police department in a different town. or better yet, take her to the hospital and tell the er doctor what was said, and they will push for something to be done. if that doesn't work, use a different police station. not all of them drink together. another police force cannot turn down a plea for help-it is an ethic code. if they try to send you back, tell them you already went to them and they didn't beleive you. i would do the hospital first though,. they will examine her and start their own investigation. then if you want, you could get a lawyer and call the local newspaper. they don't have to use your name-they will just put the story out there that a police officer was getting away with something like this.

Asi que no te preocupes si te dicen que estas histerica en el cuidado de tu bebe, NO IMPORTA SELO! se histerica! cuidalo llevalo al medico y disfrutalo, leer y asesorarte es lo mejor que puede hacer una madre. Con respecto al ni?o tienes que informar si esta es la primera vez que sucede esto. quisas solo se refleje en un cambio en las evacuaciones, cosa muy frecuente en ni?os de esa edad, que se debe al crecimiento que entre los primeros a?os de vida es muy rapido y tambien puede ser a los cambio de alimentación. Lo mejor que puedes hacer es identificar el ciclo normal de evacuación de tu hijo, consultar con tu medico si es normal a esa edad, si no presenta dolores y el ni?o sigue activo, la ansiedad ppuede ser signo de esto, así que si vez a tu hijo intranquilo quisas sea este el caso. por último al igual que los adultos los ni?os necesitan una alimentaci?on balanceada, procura darle muchas frutas y verduras y fibra, procura que aprenda a beber agua especialemnte si ha sudado mucho, unas benas bases de alimentación serán la base de su alimentación en la vida adulta, y disninulle todo aquello que sea carbohidratos procesados y azucares procesadas.|`|6b5be60f1e58ae9cedd84b4117a28abdaa	para el estra?imiento dale gerber de ciruela pasa es muy bueno|`|1ab229462d63da0ff40513971a1914beaa	Favor de darle jugo de ciruela todo el tiempo o sea todos los dias si es nesesario. A?adale en su alimento mucha fibra y agua. Sobre todo mucha agua, si llega en un momento que no puede evacuar hay supositorio y enema para bebe. Pero siempre mantente dandole la dieta alta en fibra. En los potesito de comida de bebe te dice la cantidad de fibra que tiene. Evitale un poco la leche y dale agua y jugo de ciruela. Suerte!|`|7ZlHyF93aa	A mi hijo le ha ido bien el zumo de naranja y la manzanilla, pero no le arreglo el problema del todo hasta que no comio cada día fruta y verdura. Me parece muy bien que le des fruta, verdura, zumos de uva o ciruela, fibra o no se que más, pero si no le das bastante agua de nada le sirve. asi que aguita que es muy buena, zumos tambien y sopitas. ah, y ya tiene edad que se mueva un poco, hazle estiramientos de brazos piernecitas, etc. eso ayuda tb. Suerte.|`|8f6a3bfffa40cb2c7310e8b7fd5590edaa	Dale de comer fruta porque tiene fibra y completar su alimentacion con la leche necesaria, en algunas ocaciones le puedes dar también agua (de buena calidad).|`|zyZrRRdWaa	mas agua simple y papaya.<br>  <br>  tambien ciruela pasa.<br>  <br>  muchas veces es la formula, cehca que no sea ;la leche.

Stick with stage 1, then at 11.5 months, add a little cows milk, then a little more, etc ...|`|3e84fefafa86e84da4c15fdc0df80738aa	All babies refuse to eat baby food at first.  IT takes about 15 times for them to really get used to it.  You should definately nt count that out and continue to try to feed him baby food.  At this age, he should be using his jaws to mash food and needs this practice each day.  Try making him oatmeal or baby food formula shakes (mixing them all together in a bottle) so he can gradually get used to the taste.  Then slowly mix some formula in the food in a bowl and get him used to the spoon.   <br>  <br>  The Next step formula gets the more ready for milk, which is somewhat of a myth because 90% of formulas already have milk proteins in them and they are already getting ready for milk. <br>  <br>  PS-  he is also developing his finger pinching skills at this age and he needs finger foods soon to develop this skill!<br>  <br>  Tricking a baby is perfectly okay!  They don't always know what is best for them.|`|355232ca109d88be6fb23e594e9e9813aa	Don't worry about the other formula, he'll outgrow it at 12 mo. anyways. Some babies don't like baby food and never eat it. Your son can eat most of the same things you do, finely minced and with little or no seasonings(they can upset a young tummy). People have been having babies for thousands of years and baby food and even formula have only been around for 50. My 5 1/2 mo. old daughter eats nilla wafers, noodles and some types of baby food, as well as her formula. Some babies even go to a year old without eating food, just formula, before they start to get weaned. So he's fine, just picky. Good luck!|`|EfUiKpSxaa	ok, so put some baby food on a plate as if its for you to get him interested, pretend to take a bite or two. feed him like you are feeding him your food, then gradually transition to feeding him out of his own bowl.|`|VO8IDQ98aa	my youngest never ate babyfood either, and i don't blame her, the stuff's nasty. she went straight to table-food. so as long as he's getting his formula and he's able to eat your food, let him have it. it won't hurt him. don't feed him anything too spicy, and hold off on the dairy just yet. he doesn't need the follow up formula unless he has issues with being underweight. either way, by the time he turns 1, you can wean him and feed him exclusively table-food anyway. and if you're still unsure, just call his doctor's office, they'll tell you the same thing.|`|p2tRj4DJaa	There is NO reason to put baby food in a bottle, that is just rediculous!!<br>  <br>  He doesn't really get any nutrition from baby food, its more for mom and baby to play.  By putting it in a bottle, you are defeating the purpose.<br>  <br>  Give him REAL food.  Well steamed veggies, banana, avocado, ripe pear... Start with veggies & fruits and move on to little chunks of meat from your plate, and then grains.

WRLmdjXSaa	My son is 13 and does the same thing. I took him to the store and he picked out some pajama bottoms that he really felt comfortable in. In the summer months he picked out some shorts that he sleeps in. This is all normal for a boy. But if you let him make his own choices at the store they will wear them. But wearing boxer type undies is also not indecent.|`|AA11632563	both my kids girl 16 and  boy 15 wear shorts and tshirts to bed...|`|JVC6elvUaa	My son is 16 and he just wears boxers.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	some times my son wears a muscle shirt with boxers to bed|`|479b0f2bf6896aceb0189e6be2972f36aa	my brother and boyfriend just sleep in a pair of boxers.. i dont know any guys who sleep in pajamas|`|704a1b3826973ab7fd781b174fd0a5a0aa	my brother sleeps with nothing but boxer shorts and sometimes those long pants thingies|`|JZw8137paa	I think that what your son is wearing is decent.

I would just tell your mother that he is fine.  If he is in his own room, who cares?  He should be comfortable.   I wouldn't want my son sleeping nude but boxers and a t-shirt is fine.

I would see nothing indecent about your 12 y/o son wearing a T-shirt and boxers. Ask yourself and your son if he would feel comfortable in boxers in this situation. If you both are fine with that, then don't listen to your mother. He's 12, and he's right; he's not a baby and he should be able to decide what he will wear to bed.|`|AA10690363	don't listen to your ma, go with what your son wants. my son is 11 and sleeps in boxers and t shirts, and that is what makes him happy. i have to agree, pj's are sorta for babies, let him be ...

Suerte y animo.|`|R6LYS1pGaa	Valdria la pena ir al medico nuevamente, porque seguramente se trata de una infeccion vaginal, comun en el embarazo, y por la ampicilina segun se, no hay problema en tomarla.|`|zTj0BnhQaa	Hola. Mira, no te desanimes. Animo. Si investigas un poco mas encontraras que el flujo como el que tienes es normal en embarazadas, no tienes de que preocuparte ademas tambien debes recordar que el bebe desde que lo concibes siente lo que tu sientes, entonces mantente tranquila y trata de encerrarte en una atmosfera  de amor con tu pareja y tu bebe, dile cuanto lo amas y que todo va a salir bien. Animo.<br>  <br>  De paso te envio lo siguiente:\<br>  <br>  ?Es normal el aumento de flujo vaginal durante el embarazo?<br>  Es muy frecuente que durante el embarazo la mujer se preocupe por la aparición de mayores secreciones vaginales y piensen que sea una infección que pueda afectar a su bebé. A pesar de ser causa de desagrado para tu persona y a veces también para tu pareja, este flujo es normal durante el embarazo, y no debes preocuparte.<br>  Normalmente durante todo el embarazo hay un aumento en las secreciones vaginales provocado especialmente por el aumento de las hormonas placentarias. En general se caracteriza por ser un flujo blanquecino, con poco olor, líquido, muy similar al que muchas mujeres tienen en el período premenstrual. <br>  <br>  ?Qué puedo hacer para sobrellevar mejor esta situación?<br>  A veces puede ser molesto por la cantidad y puede ser necesario el uso de protectores de algodón para mayor confort, especialmente durante el último trimestre de la gestación. Nunca uses tampones, ya que pueden introducir gérmenes indeseables en la vagina, que pueden ser causa de infecciones vaginales serias, con riesgos de infección intrauterina.<br>  Es muy importante mantener la zona genital limpia y seca. Usa solamente ropa interior de algodón, evita la ropa ajustada y los jeans y ropa de gimnasia de materiales sintéticos. Evita el uso de jabones desodorantes o muy perfumados, ba?os de espuma y desodorantes femeninos. No realices duchas vaginales a menos que estén indicadas por tu médico, y en este último caso solamente con equipos descartables y nunca los insertes a una distancia mayor de 2,5 centímetros de la vulva.<br>  <br>  ?Este flujo puede afectar a mi pareja de alguna manera?<br>  A veces este flujo es causa de irritación en el pene de tu pareja, consulta con tu médico para ver si es necesario algun tratamiento especial. Generalmente es causado por mayor acidez de las secreciones vaginales y es transitorio. <br>  <br>  ?Cómo puedo distinguir una infección?<br>  Si aparece un flujo vaginal amarillento, verdoso o espeso con mal olor o acompa?ado de ardor, picazón, enrojecimiento de la zona genital, puede deberse a una infección que requiera de un tratamiento específico. Debes consultar enseguida con tu médico para un correcto diagnóstico, y te podrá indicar óvulos vaginales o cremas especiales dependiendo de la causa que lo provoque. Generalmente se soluciona rápidamente y no son de riesgo para tu bebé. <br>  <br>  En los casos de infecciones por hongos como la Candida albicans (candidiasis), es importante tratarlas antes del parto para evitar contagiar a tu bebé durante el nacimiento. <br>  <br>  ?Cómo puedo prevenir una infección?<br>  Una buena forma de prevenir infecciones es un lavado escrupuloso de la zona vaginal especialmente después de evacuar el intestino. Siempre higieniza la zona de adelante hacia atrás, para evitar contaminar la vagina con gérmenes rectales.<br>  Trata de evitar la ingesta de azúcar refinada durante el embarazo, que pueden crear un terreno propicio en la vagina para el desarrollo de hongos.<br>  Estudios recientes indican que la ingesta diaria de 145 mililitros diarios de yogur que contenga Lactobacilus acidofilo reduce en una manera significativa el riesgo de infecciones vaginales.<br>  En los casos de infecciones por transmisión sexual (ETS), evita las relaciones sexuales sin preservativo hasta su curación completa. Para prevenir reinfecciones debes tener mucho cuidado en las relaciones sexuales evitando transferir gérmenes del ano a la vagina con los dedos, pene o lengua.<br>  Tomando mínimos recaudos puedes evitar las molestias ocasionadas por las infecciones vaginales y disfrutar sin riesgos de tu sexualidad durante todo tu embarazo.<br>  <br>  espero que te sea de ayuda y recuerda que traeras a un angelito a la vida. Felicidades.

eNExL8w0aa	If you have a normal cycle, it's approximately 2 weeks after the first day of your last period. For me though, I didn't ovulate at all without the help of medication. I'm currently pregnant, and I seemed to have conceived around the time when I should have had a period, so as you can see, it's different for everyone.|`|X05Jiim4aa	Generally you ovulate about mid way through your menstrual cycle and your menstrual cycle begins with the first day of your period.  So if you have a 28 day cycle, theoretically you'd ovulate 14 days after the first day of your period.<br>  <br>  There are ways to track your ovulation and watch your body for signs of ovulation.  Check out natural family planning websites and books for how to do that.
4JcgIuBqaa	Moms and Dads have been treating croup at home for ages.  When my kids got it we rubbed Vicks Vapo-Rub on their chest.  Then we put a humidifier in the bedroom with Vapo-Rub in the medicine dispenser and ran it all night while they slept in the moist atmosphere.  They were usually much better by morning.  All without the aid of steroids or Doctors.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	listen, my daughter had it soo bad that she stoped breathing a few times.. it is not the time to do home treatments.  There was a baby that was the same age as my daughter when she was in teh hospital for croup, that baby died from it. Dont' mess arround with something this serious.|`|pdzfq7ojaa	I almost died from Croup when I was little.  I got it all the time.  I would take him to the doctor.  To make him more comfortable, do what my parents did.  They used to run hot water in the shower for a littlewhile, then bring me into the bathroom with all the steam.  I actually remember it, and it helped a lot.
TQW5E6olaa	I think for many women, it's still there no matter what they do or don't do (except for some extreme cases)    I care about him still, but not in the same way. I care about him in relation to how it affects our daughter. I don't want to be with him, or god forbid live togther or get married, but I do enjoy our time together with our child. Who wouldn't?     We were together too long for me to hate him. We just grew apart and wanted different things, and that is perfectly okay.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Right now, I'm really, really pissed at him.    But I don't hate him.  Hate is a really strong word, and no matter what, he's my son's dad.  I don't want anything to happen to him, because I hope that eventually he will begin to be in my son's life at least a little bit.  My son deserves to know who his dad is.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i don't still love him. i really don't even like him a whole lot. that is why we divorced. but i do love the way he is with our child, and i don't want anything bad to happen to him, for my childs sake.   its normal even if he is a jerk an uninvolved. my sons father is like that. but the fact of the matter is, you 2 have something together that no one else has. the child can never be duplicated or changed. the bond started as soon as that child was born.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	My daughters father has done SO many rotten things to me while and while we are not together. If it weren't for my husband I think he would do more.   I can't even get into the things he's done there's so many....he continues to make my life hell now....  BUT I still care about him...WHY? who knows...  the father of my child...whom I spent years of my life with...I'm bound to have a soft spot still. That being said....I am nowhere near being in love with him lol...I just wish him well.|`|AkFag8tNaa	There are two fathers....the father of my oldest child and the father of my youngest (who is also my husband). I will always have warm feelings toward my ex. He was a huge part of my life and gave me a child. It went from young love to serious love to intense anger and close to hatred and then to a different kind of love that you have for someone you care about. My husband is the man I can't live without.|`|oXrDKjkkaa	I felt a lot of bitterness and animosity to the father of my kids, but that was years ago, and I'm over it.  He DID give me two incredibly wonderful kids - he can't be ALL bad?!!!  Now I really have nothing but warm wishes.  The kids love him, they need him, and that's it.|`|wJhZbUKtaa	My baby's sperm donor is a jerk.

I can count on two hands how many child support payments I have received. My daughter turns 4 this month.

Very normal.|`|axYt6Lhnaa	Mine went away, I married a real man who considers my daughter as his own. Best of luck!
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	You have to get your urine sent away to a lab in order for it to be tested for something such as listeria.  The other 2 answers were right|`|OLW0Irbhaa	They can't test for listeria in your urine.  They are checking for proteins, ketones, sugar, and blood cells and bacteria.    http://www.babycenter.com/0_urine-tests-...    If you are concerned about listeria make sure you eat properly cooked foods and microwave any lunch meats till steaming.|`|qImMwhUHaa	It's for sugar and protein. That's all.|`|98WKYtfwaa	no, they only test for protein, sugar and bacterias such as a UTI.     ask them to test for this if your paranoid about it, not sure what it is though lol.|`|HyXGhW8iaa	good question! but idk...i would just do as i was told!!! lol  call and ask...thats what they are getting paid for.

I'm 18 weeks pregnant with my first child, a little boy due July 8th, 2009, and my husband and I came up with Oren Finnlee Carrow. Carrow being the last name.

UGp5psHOaa	yes its normal the bigger your uterus the smaller your bladder remember. well not smaller.. but less room to expand<br>  <br>  A mans bladder can hold 40 oz of water a non pregnant womens can hold 36oz. A women who is full term pregnant can only hold 8 oz of fluids in their bladder.<br>  <br>  8 oz is equal to a single glass of water or juice.. <br>  <br>  a smaller bladder means more trips to the rest room.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy though God bless|`|OMyC0IJVaa	Yes, and it depends on where the baby is positioned. I had to beeline it to every bathroom of every store when I was pregnant. Once my youngest was born, my oldest, then 2 always said don't you need to pee anymore when we would walk into a store.|`|AA11379643	yeah, that's the same thing that happened to me!  I wasn't having any problems with it until around 33/34 weeks!|`|2eaaded8e03b973ab9791c78223b0d6daa	Is normal the weight of the baby is press down on the bladder|`|485f581cc274d110eb6e08f2aef02f05aa	YES VERY NORMAL, IT'S YOUR BODY GETTING YOUR TIMING READY FOR WHEN THE BABY COMES YOU HAVE TO GET UP ABOUT EVERY TWO TO THREE HOURS TO FEED AND CHANGE THE BABY. IT'S YOUR BODYS WAY OF GETTING READY FOR WANT THE BABY NEEDS LATER. YOUR PROBLEY LACTATING TOO...BEST OF LUCK CONGRATS|`|eRyVH2wMaa	its normal the baby is on ur bladder thats why|`|AA11090479	I'm no where near as far along as you (I'm only going on 11 weeks) but it seems as though it's just getting worse lol. Last night I think I counted getting up 7 times to use the bathroom. I guess the larger the baby gets the more your bladder is squished causing you to use the restroom more and more.|`|WqFqsnzwaa	It sure is!  As the baby gets bigger, there will be more pressure on your bladder.  Don't worry, it is only temporary!  Hang in there!
Vo4IXBdtaa	This has happened to me before. I like to have fun with  them. Interrupt whatever they say and start talking about anything...the trouble your son has caused today...the high cost of gas...pres. obama. eventually they give up.|`|YbH74WGkaa	What is this crybaby time, when you finally realize you have to PAY for what you agreed to and now that the stuff is gone you can'tpay?The calls are ONLY for you, SWEETHEART! Pay your bills and they won't be calling you. Knock off the crap about not knowing about your private  . YOU gave them your private  , when you agreed to buy stuff on time & promised to pay! DON"T BUY STUFF ON TIME, UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING & ABLE TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS THAT YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR!|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Owning a debt collection business makes me a very unliked person, however I can tell you what you want to know:    Inform the caller you are not the person they are asking for. And then ask to speak to a supervisor. Then, tell them that they have the wrong number and you are verbally requesting that this number be removed from their file.     You also need to inform them that you are now going to document every call you receive from them" time, date and name of rep.". You are going to be collecting info to give to your attorney in filing a harassment suit against them.    ***This plan of attack should be all that you need.**     **It better not be my company calling you! LOL|`|AA11755924	I have a new phone number and someone keeps calling for a lady that does not live in my house.  We have told them several times that there is no one there by that name and they say "ok" but they still call back.    It might be that someone is giving your information instead of their own.  I would check your credit to make sure no one is using your social security number.      Maybe just change your numbeR?  or buy a new phone that has a ringer option on it?|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I had the same problem too.  And they get so mad when you tell them they have the wrong number and sometimes they'll accuse you of lying!  Bastards.  My last name is Williams and let the bill collectors tell it, I am related to every single Williams in the country.  Nevermind that it's the 3rd most popular name; not only should I know every one of them, they should also be at my house at the precise time they call.  Finally, I started taking down their information and telling them that if they don't stop calling me, I will be contacting the FCC and lodging a formal complaint.  That stopped it.  Even if they are calling for you, if you tell them to stop, they must stop.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Tell them in a firm voice that whoever they are calling for does not live there, it is your house, and if they call again you will consider it to be harassment. If they continue to call ask for their name, their supervisors name, demand to be added to the do not call list and say if they call again you will be mailing a bill to their house for using your phone's minutes. (Even if its not a cell!)    Creditors don't understand that people move. If that person never filled a change of phone number they will just keep bugging you.|`|0TGpz08paa	Tell them that they have the wrong phone number and to leave you alone. Tell them that " whatever person " doesn't live there and that they have the wrong number.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	The first thing I would do is turn the ringer off or way down at nap time.|`|ebuxHnScaa	They want to talk to the person who owes them money. So next time they call, do whatever you have to in order to get a person. Then tell them, directly and firmly, that this is your telephone line and you do not want them to call it ever again.    It really is that simple.    No matter what they ask and what they say, after every answer you give, repeat that you do not wish them to call that line again. For example:    "Hello, I'm trying to reach Jackie Smith."    "I am not Jackie Smith. I do not know who Jackie Smith is. This is my telephone number now. Please do not call it again."    "Do you know where I can reach Jackie Smith."    "No. This is my telephone line. I do not know who Jackie Smith is. Please do not call this number again. Please stop harassing me."    And so on.    It is illegal for a collection agency to call a number after being asked not to by the owner of that line. I have never had a collection agency blatantly violate the law. Make sure you clearly and directly, as often as necessary, repeat the three important points:    1) You are not, and do not know, the person they are trying to reach.    2) This is your phone line.    3) You do not want them to call.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	A few things here....doesn't matter if you have a private number....they didn't get it out of the book...it is the number they have on file for this person.  You either call them back and demand to speak to the boss or do that when they call again...then you explain calmly that this person has not had this number for some time now and you don't know who they are...it is not the same house or anything...it simply is the phone number the phone company gave out.  If you do not get cooporation at that point, then get angry...go beyond this person if you need to..to the aurthorities, to the telecommunication commission or what have you.  They can not keep harrassing you.  Now, in regards to the phone waking your son....that won't happen if you teach your son to sleep through everything.  From birth if you never kept the noise down...kept your baby sleeping in a room of loud talking people...left them sleeping in thier swing while the tv was on...let people knock and or ring your bell at any time of the day etc etc...your child would have become a heavier sleeper and you wouldn't have to worry about noises...don't know how old he is, but I bet if you give it enough time...it isn't too late.|`|qImMwhUHaa	If they call again tell them not to call back again or you will report them. They shouldn't call back again since it's against the law for them to call when they are asked not to.

QY10Hmq7aa	Its colostrum. It's what your baby will eat before your milk comes in. Your milk comes in 2 to 3 days after you give birth.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's just colostrum, it's good for a newborn full of antibodies and protein - and it's normal to be leaking at your point in pregnancy.  No worries!|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Totally normal, just your body adjusting to being pregnant and getting ready to start supplying milk :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's colostrum. It's normal. You are gearing up to breastfeed when you have the baby. It's normal. It's fine. Google colostrum.|`|xue72D76aa	This is colostrum and it's perfectly normal.  You will probably leak on and off for the rest of the pregnancy.  When the baby is born and if you choose to breastfeed, you will feed the baby colostrum for a few days before it switches over to more milk content.  Good luck!|`|1bnhwGACaa	it is normal it is colostrum   if you want take a warm bath and try to soak your breast under the water   if this doesnt help then try to express some with your hands|`|VbvrG9NJaa	go to a docter   and like it could be normal|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	That's colostrum, which is what your breasts produce until a few days after your baby is born and your milk comes in.  I'm not sure how soon it is typical to start producing colostrum, but I do know that it isn't uncommon for it to leak.|`|KCcnUohXaa	That is totally normal, your body is just preparing for motherhood.

e1533accbcc28c987a387cfc873f55edaa	I wouldn't worry! I say this because been there done that. I was told the same thing from my doctor. I didn't like how they treated me, and I didn't believe a word they said. I am now under a different doctors care. Everything is fine. The problem is women are getting ultrasounds way to early and being misdiagnosed with miscarriages. This would save a lot of heartache if we were to wait until 12-15 weeks along. Check out this website www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com   It will bring you hope and encouragement. Don't give up hope!!  Pray alot, and Believe!! I think you will be fine.

But you never know anything could happen. Every pregnancy is different. Just keep hope take care of your self. Some how you will have an inside feeling of whats going to happen. Whether you ignore it or take it in. It's weird but listen. I had a orangish discharge.and lost my mucus plug but the ob told me i was just having a yeast infection. When really i was losing the baby. A lot of doctors do it to not scare you but who know. I will pray for you. May the baby is just stubborn or somthing. If so he/she will have it happen when their ready. And if not then maybe it's just not time yet. For some reason you know. But like i said keep hope and keep taking really good care of yourself and you never know. Things can happen. Even if they do seem impossible.|`|fca24ebaeb911467826d9c02d544945daa	I have had 2 miscarriages.  Sometimes when you first become pregnant  it is hard to see the heartbeat, which is probably why they did the transvaginal ultrasound.  It shows much more detail.  If they did not see a heartbeat in that ultrasound it is likely that you are miscarrying.  He most likely didnt use that terminology and said you *might* experience the cramping because you are not very far along.  Very sorry for your loss, I know what you are going through.|`|uckorKtBaa	With my second baby my doctor didnt even check me for a heartbeat until about 12 weeks, and didnt get a heartbeat even then. Of course it wasnt a transvag, but I think its definately possible at least that depending on the position of your uterus or something and it being very early that the baby is fine. Of course I dont know, but definately *TRY* not to stress about it because stress is hard on the baby...easier said than done I know. Good luck!|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	wow that doesn't sound good.  Based on your information it sounds like you are going to miscarry but you have to ask your doctor...we and all these people on yahoo answers can't tell you exactly what is going to happen..Your doctor is the only person who can tell you.|`|AA11663226	all i can tell u is to pray....if u do misscarry something was wrong with the baby...or because ur so early they just might havemissed it..whatever the case good luck|`|73912399022f9b6eecf36ddc0e1dc246aa	I am not sure at all but everything is going to be okay be strong for you baby every things is going to turn out okay and your going to have a beautiful bundle of joy.|`|d3a19b030a4ee8c065a52e61c2ffe4a7aa	I am so sorry to have to be the one for telling you the truth but if they cant find a fetal heartbeat during a trans vaginal ultrasound, chances are the baby has passed away and your body will soon take measures to clean out your system. If that does happen, take your time to cry and grieve. I sure hope that doesnt happen. I just want to cry.

Todas las veces que lo toque. Si llegaron como las 500 veces y nada, le podes sacar algo que le guste, como sus dibujitos preferidos, o algun autito o juguete que use mucho, siempre explicandole que se lo sacas porque no se porta como es debido.

Cuando un ni?o está agresivo le faltan nutrientes, particularmente minerales y ácidos grasos omega-3 que es lo que tiene el aceite de lino que puedes encontrar en herboristerías o farmacias. Denle mucha fruta fresca, cereales completos (integrales, y a poder ser crudos) y ensaladas variadas, de vez en cuando un poco de pescado, pero repito carnes y lácteos nada. Cuando los ni?os tienen esta problemática la proteína animal es muy mala ya que evita que las toxinas que todos vamos acumulando en el cuerpo se eliminen. Los minerales más convenientes son el zinc y el selenio. Una terapia de esta manera no falla, no sólo para un ni?o de tres a?os con agresividad sino para toda clase de problemas con la salud.

Also, if you are eating the fish (as opposed to catch and release) then you want to make sure they are safe to eat (most local DEC offices will tell you where you should and should not eat the fish). And finally, your OB or midwife will tell you how much fish you should safely consume in pregnancy; mostly the concern is ocean fish that contain high levels of mercury.

We took him to a baby shower last week and he freaked out! He would'nt let anyone hold him. He is more at ease around people if they come over to our house and hold him.

If you take percocets while pregnant for any extended time- there will be a withdrawl whether it is inutero or after the child is born is the difference. Not a good thing to do. I would say fron 35 wees on the child could be born with symptoms of withdrawl. Poor sucking reflex and laboured breathing irratibility- just to name a few.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	uhm with drawl in new borns is a early sign of autism and why would a mother take percocets with her baby any ways.|`|32f8fe63afce4db27a606844198a1c4aaa	The withdraws from percocet is not severe. I was perscribed them during pregnancy for a ruptured disk in my back. I asked the Dr. if there would be effects on the baby and he said that the baby would not experience any side effects if I did'nt abuse the medication. My son was born perfect. He seemed to have no effects what so ever. If the mother is abusing the medication effects would still be mild. The baby may experience sleeplessness, fussiness, and in very rare cases tremmors. This medication is widely used during pregnancy because of the lower risks as opposed to other pain killers.|`|6703ccea477dafd745674a6f09c84ce0aa	i was addicted to pain pills & i just knew having a baby would definitley give me the will power (did'nt work )so i went to a methadone clinic b/c it was the safest option i had & thank god b/c i was only on it for 2 months of my preg she had no w/d from it i would ask a doc this question b/c my consular (not the clinic doc) but my personal consular(sp) ? said my child would'nt have w/d on methadone that is not not true ! my doc said it takes a baby about a week (my obgyn) to w/d from pain pills and i could'nt be that kind of mom but pain pills grab u & dont let ya go trust me !! methadone is less harmful on your organs but 3x more addicting ( and no high-if that's what someones after their beat) but if your baby is born addicted to pain meds or methadone they have a medicine that helps them -but i did'nt want my baby girl i've wished for for soooo long to go through any discomfort b/c of me and with pain pills opposed to methadone (whoever) will have social services on their tail b/c u have to tell them the hospital that is - for the babys sake methadone on the other hand u must inform them as well when social services came to visit me and my baby they commended me for going to the clinic opposed to staying on the pills b/c it shows you wanna do what's best but it so damn hard them pills i know so many people addicted to pain pills it's a crazy sad epidimic well i hope my info was helpful best of luck with your research|`|xm5vcCL9aa	stop taking them, the baby will not have withdrawl. <br>  They give you meds in the hospital, only trace amounts is given to the baby.<br>  so quit NOW
AA12395564	It doesn`t sound like you are pregnant. Sorry if you were hoping to be................|`|AA11974580	It might be too soon to tell even with a blood test.  My best advise is to simply wait and see if you get your period or not and in the mean time, treat yourself like you are pregnant just to be on the safe side.|`|I9JZxbFRaa	you could be pregnant, but every woman is different. when i was pregnant with my daughter i had my period like normal for the first 3months. if you just started a new birth control that could cause a difference, like spotting. like i said every woman is different, you could be, but i think maybe not because the easiest time to get pregnant according to doctors is the end of the second week after your period. don't stress, i just hope that you get the outcome you want, weather its to be pregnant or not|`|UaKeW6bCaa	Hey it really might be too early to tell but just by reading what you wrote you have a better than 50% chance of being pregnant..is this what you want??|`|eRyVH2wMaa	yes u might be.

9e2981d8ea3fb69d67996f4022335b45aa	I've used depo a couple of times for up to 12 months at a time.  I had a couple of issues with it, but not everyone has problems.<br>  <br>  They recommend it as it is very reliable and is not affected by antibiotics, sickness, 'the runs' or taking a pill late!<br>  <br>  If you are having specific problems with it you should discuss it with your nurse/doctor.  My main problem was migraines towards the end of the 12 week period caused by the hormone levels wearing off.  It can also cause you to put weight on.|`|11637b050a5775f98e7116ce8c30ab20aa	As long as you have the injection done every 10 weeks your ok.

So maybe you should get some kind of protection.|`|a04a9f35e4c0890c3d753a0cf195a784aa	you had sex on day 14 of your cycle when ovulation usually takes place, so you should very well be pregnant..<br>  take a test and see what it says, if its neg it maybe too early so wait a few days and take it again|`|v3ftD1yZaa	Don't freak out :) yes, you can be pregnant. I agree with the other girl, wait a few weeks to see if your period comes, then you can take the test when you're sure.

KHf9XDQ3aa	Listen, this is a doctor speaking. If the girl had the possibility of being pregnant, she would have felt cravings. The chest pains would have created swollen breats and a slight bit of pressure would have caused some of the milk/water out. But if she has stomach pains, she must be having a cramp. She might be having her menstrual period currently.  Do not worry. However, the chest pains could be an early stage of asthma or a contractions in the diaphram, so take her to a doctor and check it out.|`|OtAA2zUuaa	Is this the same chick you are asking about Abortion? <br>  <br>  Why don't you just get her to take a pregnancy test?

sEodEylwaa	granola bars are good when you want something sweet or mixed nuts for when you want something salty..|`|AA10202158	Well, it depends on how much you want to spend, but there are lots of products that have 100 calorie snacks, that are cookies, chips, etc.   And fruit yogurt cups, fruit, (I love fresh pineapple that you get already cut up at Walmart), baby carrots, celery with peanut butter, can't think of more, but there are lots of stuff like this out there.   I gained 30 pounds with my son, how about you?|`|VUe9fhSWaa	Fruit ( bananas, apples) also those fruit and cereal bars, I have some that are fat free, You can get them at Wal Mart for like 1.50 a box, I keep them all the time. Also, strawberry applesauce!! I have been eating all of these things my whole pregnancy and have only gained 43 lbs and I 'm 38 weeks! (I say ONLY because with my last 2 I gained 60 lbs). Another thing is for some reason I crave cereal, the good chocolately kind, but I figure that ceareal is better than a candy bar, so when I crave chocolate, I eat the cocoa pebbles, or cocoa puffs!! At least there's some kind of nutritional value. (Shh, don't tell my kids cuz I'm still shoving them full of Kix and Cheerioes, I hide the good stuff for myself!!! LOL)|`|d7LpdFluaa	yogurt, and pudding are really good ones.  it really just depends on what your craving, cause like with me, sometimes I just can't get that sweet tooth to go away!!|`|AA11448771	I love ice cream!! It was one of my major cravings at the beginning of the pregnancy... mainly because they would help with the bad heartburn. When my weight started going out of control I started having lots of fruit... fresh fruit, and instead of creamy ice cream I started having popsicles... you can find the fruity ones, which are healthier or make them yourself. Just blend some strawberries with milk and a little bit of sugar and freeze it in small cups, I have made them with mangos, banana and just milk with a couple drops of vanilla to flavor it. That way you are having your dose of real fruit and milk.|`|BSLIIYkMaa	fruits and vegetables are good to grab,example.carrot sticks, apples slices,celery, wholegrain chips|`|g1aHInYSaa	You could buy some of those chocolate gramcrackers and cool whip.

You can get cheese flavored or caramel or plain. I have eaten those throughout my whole pregnancy as a snack and haven't gained that much weight. I am 38 weeks with first baby. The plain rice cakes also helped me to not vomit so much in my first trimester.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	granola bars|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	granola bars, yogurt, sugar free jello, those 100 calorie cookies *they come in Oreo and chocolate chip*, mixed nuts, fruit..etc.
a4iQSZPUaa	Absolutely you could be pregnant.  The pill maintains levels of circulating hormones to prevent pregnancy.  When you miss the pill, these hormonal levels decrease therefore allowing you to become pregnant.  No way should you start a new pack without first knowing for sure if you are pregnant.|`|AA12314337	You could be pregnant.

Go get a pregnancy test, NOW. If it's negative, go back on your pills, oh, and have ya heard of AIDS and STD's. You might want to use condoms as well.|`|tXtfqAFtaa	Yes, but if you have been taking the pill for a while, its a  very slight chance. It would probably be a good idea to take a test before you start more pills, but I would not fret too much about it. It is possible, each woman's body is different, but pretty unlikely.

MLiefnU9aa	I would get together with family and talk about the good times and what I miss about her.   I would plant a tree in her memory if I had not already.   I would eat her favorite dinner on the anniversary of her death.  I would talk to her and let her know I miss her and still hurt but know that I will see her someday.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	My brother passed away 4 years ago after surviving in Iraq to be killed on a motorcycle in the States.  I "talk" to him when I feel like I need some help.  Tell him I miss him, look at pictures.  I made a scrapbook of him shortly after he passed away so it could be shown at his funeral.  It is now displayed in a lovely display case with my parents.<br>  <br>  Every year we drink a beer in toast of my brother on the date of his death.  Of course, I am legally able to do so.  I'm looking at having a tattoo done in his rememberance, problem is, I can't quite decide on what I want.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss.  Just remember the good times and don't be afraid to talk to your family and friends about it.

Go by her grave talk to her give her some flowers and tell her about your life and what she has missed even though she was with you the whole time. Stick in there. I lost my mom and that is what I do.|`|uwrVgSKuaa	um i never knew someone that died very well. but i thought this many years later u would be um over it?

MM63T1Zvaa	Stress can cause you to have preterm labor, the baby to have low birth weight. You should really talk to your doctor about these issues. You may possibly need to talk to a therapist or a social worker to help you deal with these issues. You really should reach out and get help now because depression during and after the birth is hard to deal with but you will be able to get through it. Good luck|`|7823a3ee0872a6ae329f9b447fd183a5aa	it is harming the childs development. it stunts their growth.|`|89085d22dd3f8a532bd5d3e430981553aa	First of I want to tell you stress wont make your baby gay. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. But it can make your blood pressure go up and stress the baby. With one of my babies I was under a lot of stress and it caused him to have a bowl movement in the uterus. He was fine but when they do that there is a risk of infection. Stress can also cause pre term labor. You should really talk to your doctor about it and get some help. Good luck|`|C7cr7bmzaa	Stress and depression messes with the way the baby grows health wise. I also heard that if you stress out a lot during your pregnancy it can cause the baby to be gay. Its complicated but its true. My friend is pregnant and her boyfriend puts her through hell but she realized that the best thing to do is not stres off of him and just to stay happy about the baby and worry about that, and thinking like that has been helping her a lot.|`|9iirvwBiaa	if you are worried, then exercise!! When you exercise, your body releases those "feel good hormones" endorphins. These hormones actually cross the placenta making your baby feel great too. I dont mean strenuous hard exercise, but any light form, like yoga, walking etc. This will also make you feel better aswell. Try meditating maybe aswell. This will bring your stress level down.<br>  Good luck.....|`|L3Q5QEHFaa	your baby will deplete you of anything it needs, just try and take it easy. i had a hard time during pregnancy, my baby could nt be healthier, im not advertising stress mind, but dont make things worse by worrying about this, lifes too short and your baby is too important|`|bS6VTIeXaa	Try to take it one day at a time.  I have been and I am going through something that seams similar.  I have depression and not on meds..  I have a manic-depressive mother who has been acting out a whole lot more lately.  I have a 2 year old that is fine.  I just had to do everything in my powers to keep my cool.  Just try to stay away from your triggers.  Getting stressed out and getting yourself worked up will raise your blood pressure which is not good for your child.   So like I said try to stay a calm as possible.  If you have to talk to your Dr and they may have to place you on meds that are safe for you and the baby!!|`|dzeLj3kuaa	I`ve been stressed an depressed my entire pregnancy, an let me tell stop now. The whole entire 9 months i have been sick, morning sickness, cramps, dehydration, an ext...  Ive been in an out the hospital. And as far as his farther goes he was a major part of it so i put him out of my life for good right now. You should talk yo somebody it helps to talk to other pregnant moms. Just think about your baby and good luck=)|`|h7ZNTNgEaa	It lowers your immune system and that can effect your baby. And the farther along you get the more the baby can seance your feeling and you don't want your baby to be depressed do you. Try to find a way to relax and good luck|`|lFgkoLmmaa	Yes it can affect your baby in a way, because with my first baby I wasnt with his dad and I was really depressed, I wasnt eating, I was always crying. I didnt gain that much weight. When my baby was born he was really small, he weighed 5lbs, but he is a healthy boy, he is 3 now. Now my second pregnancy I lost my baby at 26 weeks because he had no kidneys,and no one can tell me why. With this pregnancy I had a really bad time, I was really depressed, I think more than with my first. I blame myself for my baby's loss. I am not saying this is going to happen to you but its better for you to be happy and healthy, talk to your doctor about only he or she knows exactly what is going with your baby, and if you feel that stressed out go to counseling, or take anti depressants.|`|AA10543909	It's more likely to be harming you, if possible you need to either resolve the issues with the father quickly or stay away from him.

60552f0baf0b4f634df3f77eca3c3147aa	I know how you feel. I miscarried last Aug and since then it feels like the whole world around me is pregnant. There's really no good way to cope, you just have to be strong. Keep yourself busy and try your hardest to be supportive of your sis in law. After I miscarried, and even today, I find myself keeping my distance from those that I know are pregnant. If your sister-in-law loves you, she should understand if you keep your distance from her. At the same time, you don't want to take her happiness away from her. Its a tough situation. Trust me, I've been there and I know. I think that a m/c is the toughest thing that a woman has to go thru. What hurts me the most other than the obvious is when people repeatedly told me "It just wasnt meant to be....or you'll have another baby." People think they are helping, but they really arent by saying those things. Yes, you may get pregnant again and have another baby. But regardless, you still wanted THAT baby. That baby is gone. People don't understand that. And people dont understand that its hard for us to be around other women with babies. Sorry, its hard. I really don't think that WE should have to be the only ones who have to deal with it. I think that those who love us should also have to deal with the fact that if they have a baby, we just may not want to be around them. Yes, we will get over it. But damn, give us time. Its hard. People need to try to understand that. Anyways, advice on how to deal with your sis in law's new baby - keep your distance if you feel you need to. Its okay if you need to keep your distance. If your not ready to be around her baby and you force yourself, you are only causing yourself more hurt. Just explain to her how you feel and let her know that when you are ready, you will come around. Hope I helped.|`|miqODd4jaa	I wasn't on your end of this situation.. I was on the other end. My husbands best friend's wife was due the same day as me and she miscarried at 6 months... it has took her about 1 year to be able to be around me and my daughter... so my advice is coming from that end...<br>  <br>  I felt terrible for her. I could feel her pain. Just know that she will be there for you to talk if you need her to.|`|X05Jiim4aa	I'm so sorry.  I don't have any advice for you but I can imagine it must be incredibly painful mixed with bittersweet joy for them and their baby.<br>  <br>  Are there any miscarriage support/TTC after loss support groups in  your area?  I've seen them advertised in local kids magazines at peds office, daycares etc.  Just talking with people in similar situations can help.
BMGQHTW4aa	Explain the new baby will have a daddy, but that his/her daddy won't be there all the time like his daddy.  You can also tell him sometimes mommies get to do the jobs of daddies too and for the new baby that's what you will do.|`|M6OddXQgaa	don't tell unless he asks. if he asks just say that the new baby's daddy is different from his daddy. different meaning the new baby's dad is not going to be around like his dad is. just try to keep it simple.|`|X05Jiim4aa	That's a tough one, but the baby will have a daddy.  If your 3 yr old knows the guy then just tell them that so and so is the daddy but you are just friends.  Or just tell them that this baby's daddy is not in your lives.  The biggest thing will probably be trying to explain that your ex is not this baby's daddy, but someone else's who is not in the picture.|`|pAFpg9xMaa	I think you are putting way too much thought into this.  It will only be an issue if you make it an issue.  If the child is asking who is the baby's daddy than give him a straight up answer that is appropriate for his age.  If you ask the child why or who does he think... what does he say.  All you need to do is answer exactly what the child wants to know and nothing more.  Your child may just be concerned that he is going to have to share his daddy.  Try looking to your toddler for more clues if he continues to make it an issue otherwise let it go.|`|AA10943329	your baby does have a dad. But like your other child he will not be living with you. Families are made up all different ways and this is one way. Congrats on your baby and enjoy him/her when it arrives. I'm envious

FELICIDADES POR EL NUEVO BB|`|ca9orWG5aa	No hay problemas con la compatibilidad sanguínea, cuando los dos padres tienen el mismo grupo sanguíneo y factor RH.<br>  <br>  Lee lo siguiente y comprenderas mejor.<br>  <br>   GRUPO SANGUíNEO (A)-(B)-(O)<br>  <br>  El más importante de los diversos sistemas de clasificación de la sangre es el del grupo sanguíneo ABO. Los cuatro tipos sanguíneos que se contemplan en esta clasificación son el A, el B, el AB y el O. Las células sanguíneas del grupo A tienen el antígeno A en su superficie. Además, la sangre de este grupo contiene anticuerpos contra el antígeno B presente en las células rojas de la sangre del grupo B. La sangre de este último grupo tiene la composición inversa al grupo A. En el suero del grupo AB no existe ninguno de los dos anticuerpos previos, pero los glóbulos rojos contienen los antígenos A y B. El grupo O carece de estos antígenos en los eritrocitos, pero este suero es capaz de producir anticuerpos contra los hematíes que los contengan. Si se transfunde sangre del grupo A a una persona del grupo B, los anticuerpos anti-A del receptor destruirán los glóbulos rojos de la sangre transfundida. Como los eritrocitos de la sangre del grupo O no contienen ningún antígeno en su superficie, la sangre de este grupo puede ser empleada con éxito en cualquier receptor. Las personas del grupo AB no producen anticuerpos, y pueden por tanto recibir transfusiones de cualquiera de los cuatro grupos. Así, los grupos O y AB se denominan donante universal y receptor universal respectivamente.<br>  <br>  Factor Rh, término que se aplica a cualquiera de las más de treinta sustancias que reciben el nombre de aglutinógenos y que se encuentran en la superficie de los eritrocitos sanguíneos. Son diferentes de los principales tipos de grupo sanguíneo, pero se desconoce su composición. Los factores Rh se descubrieron en la sangre del mono rhesus en 1937. Este primer aglutinógeno Rh, que correspondía a lo que se denomina en la actualidad Rh0, está presente en la sangre de casi el 85% de los seres humanos. Las reacciones sanguíneas en las que participan factores Rh tienen interés sobre todo en obstetricia.<br>  <br>  La presencia de factores Rh en la sangre está controlada por las leyes de la herencia. Un individuo que posea un gen que codifique la existencia de factor Rh expresará dicho factor en los glóbulos rojos. Los hijos de una mujer con dos genes recesivos para el factor Rh0, es decir, que sea Rh negativo, y un hombre que tenga uno o dos genes que expresen el factor Rh positivo, expresarán el factor Rh0. Cuando esta madre esté embarazada y el feto sea Rh positivo, la madre producirá anticuerpos contra el factor Rh0 en el 5% de los casos. Por lo general, estos anticuerpos serán demasiado débiles como para causar da?os al primer hijo, pero destruirán los glóbulos rojos de la sangre de cualquier hijo posterior que sea Rh positivo. Esta reacción origina la eritroblastosis fetal o enfermedad del Rh, que produce ictericia, anemia, da?o cerebral, y con frecuencia la muerte antes o poco después del nacimiento del bebé.<br>  <br>  En la antigüedad, la enfermedad del Rh se trataba realizando una transfusión de sangre a los ni?os que sobrevivían. En la actualidad, se analiza el Rh de la pareja antes de que tenga hijos. Cuando una mujer Rh negativa tiene un ni?o con un hombre Rh positivo se le administra una inyección de una sustancia denominada Rhogam después del parto. El Rhogam es una gammaglobulina que contiene anticuerpos contra el factor Rh0. El Rhogam evita que la madre se inmunice contra el factor Rh0 al destruir cualquier eritrocito Rh positivo que haya podido emigrar desde el feto hacia la circulación de la madre. De este modo, los posibles hijos Rh positivos que pueda tener más tarde no estarán expuestos a anticuerpos anti-Rh0. Este procedimiento ha servido para erradicar casi la enfermedad del Rh.<br>  <br>  Microsoft ? Encarta ? 2007. ? 1993-2006 Microsoft Corporation.

You mean the heartbeat, right?  You should be able to hear the heartbeat from either side. They have some amount of space in there.

Why does everyone want twins?|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	Babies move all the time.

I am Julie not Henry.|`|AR683Nz6aa	baby has probly just moved to other side, check with your midwife.|`|3SIRKIBaaa	Remember, your baby is really small around this time so that means he or she has a lot of space to move around.

They'll move all over the place until they run out of room, which for me was around 27 weeks.
G7DlDjJhaa	why are you having sex with a senior anyways?  isnt he a little old? lol    otherwise uhh, its probably not that she hates you and if she says that its probably all a cover to make herself look like shes not jealous around her friends and make herself feel better.  bc really its just a natural thing she probably cant help it.  i see your side but think about her's as well. put yourself in her shoes, you wouldn't like you either :)|`|kBp9IzQqaa	Troll.|`|yjQOeuTGaa	no offense, but hell yeah. i mean, she may still like him. And be jealous of you. It may help to look at things for her point of view.|`|lQmGDPIoaa	Yes she hates you for doing wrong things that you shouldnt do.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	He did it to her, he'll do it to you. Why do women fight over trash that just wants in your pants? The next piece of *** willing to let him in her pants will be the next "it" girl and you'll be left in the dust.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Girls get jealous. She has probably known him longer and has become attached to him. She is probably mad because he left her for someone way younger which she sees as an insult. I don't think she actually hates you but you did upset her. And if this guy is jumping from one bed to another are you sure you wanna be sleeping with him? Sounds to me like the whole thing is bad news.|`|MCeh0uIaaa	she hates you because you are a wh*re, dear.|`|cmEi3CVqaa	uhm well not i guess it's not     coz its her problem with him not you, she should be mad at him for ditching her. u didnt make him or anything (i assume).|`|KUZsgJqwaa	no.  shes just jealous.    egnor her.|`|ID2AH1EBaa	Yeah, i know if it were reversed, like i used to be the guy a girl was doing and she left me for someone else i wouldn't take to kindly to it. I would hate her more than you though.|`|bELqEsdOaa	I think you should have some respect for yourself. "Date" someone closer to your age.|`|gXBPLitzaa	Well thats how girls are get used to it.  She needs to just mind her own bussiness tho.|`|QfJrdA1Yaa	i just think you're a whore.     praise allah|`|s1IkFOJVaa	SEX EVERYDAY AFTER SCHOOL?  DAMN I WISH I COULD FIND A GIRL LIKKE U SLUTTY|`|B3VYy8sFaa	I think you need to get your prorities straight... who cares if some chick hates you.. you're running around with some guy who clearly only wants sex and you're only 14 or 15.     I pray you're using protection.|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Hmm.. well this guy's probably just using you by the way..  But back to your question.. she's just jealous. Especially because not only did another girl take her guy, but someone like four years younger did. It's kind of a slap in the face.    So no, I don't think any hate is justified, but her disliking you is legit from her perspective.|`|tmIFbL8aaa	ura a HOE and u deserve a STD|`|MsLKIJWJaa	First of all you shouldn't be having sex as a freshman I think it is irresponsible and well your just not old enough even though you are already doing it. The chick totally hates you but that can be the beginning I mean if she really started to hate you a lot then well she can do something to you. I suggest you end this thing because the dude is just using you for sex I mean once he goes away to college he is not going to want a sophomore chick holding him down or something.|`|49LiABmvaa	she's probably jealous because he chose you over her  which means she should be mad at him not you  but girls are caddy so they hate every other girl around them for no reason anyway    my advice is to stop  im 14 and pregnant and you probably don't want to end up like me  but you probably won't even listen to me so just use protection ir you're going to continue|`|e1d7c0b642141d7ecbf2dcfdec779dcbaa	Do you think this guy will eventually ditch you for someone else when he's bored?? Would you hate the next girl he sleeps with after you?? No, that really shouldn't give her a reason to hate you, she should hate the guy for using her, like he's using you. Instead of having sex everyday after school, why don't you join a sport or do something more productive with your time. What if he has herpes and you contract them? It's not something that will go away ever. Find someone who likes you for you and not a guy who sleeps around.|`|TV4I1aALaa	Of course it is.  Girls cause so much drama.  its ridiculous.  but use it to your advantage.  You've got him.  and she doesnt.  Shes jealous of you.      hope i helped =]
QXSFpMzDaa	Actually I love using boy names or very androgynous names for girls.  I think Cole is really cute.|`|mimykKnhaa	lol my name is nicole, and i get called Nic. now THATS butch|`|pLcUFBl2aa	No no no....just stick with Nikki.|`|aJu53IX4aa	Cole is a boy's name.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I prefer Coley myself.|`|asSAl651aa	its not bad i guess|`|zGtELDrnaa	it depends what her personality is like. if a tomboy:yes. Girly:no|`|K7HyCzD4aa	Not as a nickname, no.    I think if there name was actually Cole then i think that would be more a boys name.|`|MuKiALlwaa	I think it's fine as a nickname. But I think Nikki is a better nickname for Nicole. Cole is a boy's name, but it's okay for a nickname.|`|i2RSpZ6caa	I don't really like it unless you're just calling Nicole that. I mean I wouldn't want that to replace the name like Bobby replaces Robert and then Robert only gets used on formal stuff.|`|CVKGpg3qaa	nikki sounds better|`|rn71HBKHaa	i think it is a boys name and you could have  Nic or Nicki for a nickname|`|VbUpMxrvaa	I've always thought boy's names for girls was cute but cole..  eh not so much.|`|oIwyc5w2aa	I like it as a nn that way she can choose if she wants she can go by Nicky or Nicole.|`|0eabb6823f3dd9ff4491488ee1b5f7b9aa	as a nickname no|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Yes because Cole is a boy's name.  Although as long as it's a nickname for something, it's not so bad.|`|b420d43435194f42e90746dbe1cd633daa	instead of Cole, call her "Coley" pronounced KOH-lee
tJxlYiNwaa	Desses eu fico em dúvida entre Alexa e Giulia , os dois s?o lindos .<br>  <br>  Giulia : é a forma italiana de Júlia. <br>  Júlia : Cheia de juventude.<br>  <br>  <br>  Alexa: defensora da ra?a humana.<br>  <br>  <br>  Se eu fosse vc , escolheria entre um dos dois.

Gostei|`|8895c4c57b3385bbaca5fb9f1775b32aaa	Giulia, ou mesmo Júlia...........nome clássico que n?o depende de modismos. Continua bonito como sempre. Assim como Déborah, porém este é mais comum. Os outros dois, embora bonitos, me parecem coisa de momento.|`|EfPnI2Guaa	eu prefiro GIULIA e o mas bonito e delicado para uma bela menina e linda como sera sua filhota|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	Giulia é mto lindo.. é um nome bonita, leve, e moderno.. tbm parece de realeza.. se eu fosse vc, colocava giulia..<br>  <br>  bjs, e parabens pra vc mamae.|`|PR7YdQoWaa	Destes gostei mais de Alexa...mas ainda prefiro Sara ou Sofia.|`|dpqonymeaa	Eu prefiro Giullia, acho mais meigo e doce!|`|k3drugmKaa	Desses gostei mais de Alexa, é um nome bem diferente mais n?o é esquisito. Gosto de nomes únicos por isso escolho Alexa.|`|Bq0WNpovaa	Débora!<br>  pq toda Débora q conheci é muito esperta inteligente e simpática|`|ChaXcpEbaa	Deborah pois todas as deboras que conheci sabem tomar decisoes sao calmas e inteligentes!!!<br>  As anas, carolines, vanessas tambem se quiser uma menina que nao para quieta coloque de andressa!!!|`|Do5MkyV8aa	Júlia minha neta tem esse nome, é um doce de criatura, é um nome aben?oado.|`|GA9akjljaa	Giulia<br>  além do nome ser lindo tem um otimo significado!<br>  <br>  significa cheia de juventude e indica uma pessoa de memória prodigiosa, muito senso de organiza??o e um dinamismo contagiante.

Portanto acho que a melhor maneira de se escolher um nome, é compararmos as pessoas que já existem com suas respectivas personalidades.<br>  Por exemplo: Jorge: pessoa que bebe muito, Márcia: costuma gostar muito de sexo e acaba ficando mal-falada, e assim por diante.<br>  Agora, diante disso que escreví, se vc quiser colocar um nome forte, respeitável,e sobretudo muito correto, vou lhe dar uma bela sugest?o: Rafaela,,,,,,,,, esse é o nome!!!!!<br>  Pode apostar!!!!!!!!|`|Lj2RGlajaa	Jéssica.|`|8CJv96wJaa	Dessses ai gostei mais de Alexa mais prefiro nomes menos complicados ,tipo ana luiza,vitoria ,antonia etc
ZixCsWFsaa	A mulher pede o desejo sexual, sim. Mas n?o tem nada a ver com a sensibilidade do seios. Durante a amamenta??o a mulher produz um horm?nio chamado Prolactina. Esse horm?nio tira todo apetite sexual, pois deixa a mulher mais voltada para a "cria". Além de tirar o apetite sexual, esse horm?nio faz com que a mulher n?o ovule ou ovule muito pouco.|`|bddd6d414c1546365b309004cda760c8aa	Isso depende muito de mulher pra mulher. No caso da minha mulher o que aconteceu foi justamente o oposto. Ela ficou ainda mais acesa e a fim de sexo. Mas isso depende muito da fisiologia de cada mulher.|`|349ed09ea788c9852cdc3bfc8634caf8aa	sim|`|2VTjrTHHaa	Depende! Algumas mulheres tem sim a perda temporária do desejo sexual.. mas n?o se preocupe com o tempo as coisas melhoram!|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	veja o que eu encontrei nesse site que fala sobre amamenta?ao:<br>  <br>  A amamenta??o diminui o desejo sexual? <br>  <br>  R. às vezes sim, às vezes n?o. Os resultados de pesquisas s?o conflitantes. O desejo sexual depende de muitas coisas, além dos horm?nios. O cansa?o n?o ajuda muito, n?o é mesmo? Tanto a mulher como o homem est?o se adaptando a uma nova vida, cuidando desse novo ser. A energia, antes dependida em noites de amor, podem estar sendo usadas, para trocar fraldas, dar banho, amamentar. A boa notícia é que isso n?o é para sempre e vocês podem superar essa fase... Portanto, tenham paciência se as coisas n?o parecem ser as mesmas. Todos passamos por essa experiência e depois de algum tempo - mais ou menos, dependendo de cada casal.|`|fy0UhcaBaa	é, meu nobre, parece que a casa caiu pra você !<br>  é melhor você procurar o endere?o de algumas casas de show, boates e afins.<br>  heheheheheheheheheehe.|`|7344e1c39477d0893b401b786bdb9081aa	no que diz respeito à interferência hormonal sobre o desejo sexual no ... quando a mulher está amamentando|`|fSWkqnfnaa	olha a ,comigo é assim eu estou  amamentando e perdi toda vontade de tranzar é melhor vc ter pasiensa|`|tb9Rt5Bdaa	Sim, é verdade. N?o é por acaso que a natureza é perfeita!!! A mulher fica muito voltada para a crian?a e isso realmente afeta seu desejo sexual, ainda sem comentar a prolactina que também diminui o desejo sexual feminino. Mas n?o fique assustada pois os maridos, na maioria das vezes, também diminuem o ritmo sexual. Eles entendem que as mulheres devem guardar energia para cuidar da crian?a, além de que o período de resguardo deve ser respeitado.<br>  Abra?os.
ZixCsWFsaa	N?o! Ninguém engravida através de sexo anal. Mas hey... como assim?

Poor thing.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	my daughter recently started doing this also she is 16 months old. i talked to my dr about it and he called it night terrors. he said at this age they start to realize they are dreaming, and it scares them. when she does this at night i usually just pick her up and rock her and rub her back within 10 minutes she is back in her crib.|`|53HQy6TSaa	Get some ambient noise going in her room, like a humidifier or a little radio that plays rainforest sounds. That way, little noises won't scare her|`|1mwx2OZRaa	My daughter went thru a scared stage at this age.... tell her that mommy will keep her safe always..... she will trust you more and eventually grow out of it....|`|O7BkNoI2aa	My daughter is the same way, but she gets it from me. I will wake up screaming in my sleep sometimes (very rarely though now). Or I will talk in my sleep... etc. My daughter will raise up and be crying for momma, but she's still asleep. she will kinda look around (but her eyes are still shut) and then lay her head back on her pillow. Sometimes now (she's 22 months) she will actually get up while still asleep and stumble around and trip over something or stumble into the wall poor thing. She doesn't do this everynight though just once in a while about once a week or a little less than that... maybe 3 times a month or so... I don't know how to get her out of this, becuase I never grew out of it or anything... it just gets better with time. Like I said my daughter does it about 3 times a month or so, but I only do it about once every 3 or 4 months if not less than that... I'm sorry if I didn't help any but I thought you might like to hear from someone else who's going through it too. But when my daughter has her 2 yr check up in may I'm going to ask the doctor about it... Thats what you should do just ask her pediatrician at her next check up or make an appt for that if youve already had her 18 mo check up. He can give you some advice on how to deal with it or maybe they might make medicine for it I don't know... Good luck!|`|V3RWP8rgaa	Sounds like she is having night terrors, there is nothing you can do about it, she will grow out of it
