A una amiga:                    Si sientes, que después de cada noche saldrá el día,   si piensas, que después de haber llorado tanto vendrá tu recompensa,   si decides, levantarte después de cada caída y piensas que siempre hay algo o alguien por quien luchar   si lamentas, haber perdido un amor, nunca olvides que por algo pasan las cosas.      Si en el mundo hay más penas que alegrías, nunca bajes los brazos y no te quejes   si la vida no es color de rosa como pensabas, trata de mezclar los colores,   para que formen una sola palabra que perdurará por siempre y no te guardará rencores,   porque sólo habrá amistad de la buena y será duradera.       Mi gran amigo                    Cada día que pasa, mas me doy cuanta de como eres   me doy cuenta del gran amigo que tengo a mi lado   aquel amigo que con su sonrisa me muestra un mundo maravilloso y me hace feliz   aquel amigo que tanto valoro y aprecio   Con orgullo puedo decir "ese es mi amigo”   yo se que problemas es lo que sobra y que aunque no se quiera, siempre van a existir, por eso te digo amigo mío que si algún día llegue a fallar, sepas que siempre estarás en mi corazón y que pase lo que pase recordare aquellos peque?os pero significativos momentos juntos.

I wrote a novel, and it was accepted to be published! It's my first one, and I am excited. It's a detective novel, about a murder of an old rich woman, Emily Inglethorp. Bodley Head Books is about to publish it. They assigned me an editor, an oldish woman called Miss Howse. I can't say that she does not know her job, she is good at it. But in my book I mentioned a cup of cocoa which my victim had a cup of cocoa at bedtime. She likes to take it at night or whatever the fancy took her, so she was served a cup every evening. Plain coco, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it. It mentioned in my book frequently. The problem is,  Miss Howse insist that it must be spelled "coco" - as in Coco Chanel. I showed her dictionaries and tins of cocoa, but she is not to be moved. She says that it must be "coco" or my book won't be published. What should I do?

20090203122824AANqIjN	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of the first Few pages of my book?	I am only 13, so idk how good it reeaaallly is!   You never know how much you love something until it is gone, even the simplest, most obvious things in the world. Take your arm, for example. Imagine living without it. This thought became a reality to Valerie, the most amazing girl in Jackson.   She was so different from everyone else in Jackson, a small suburban town outside of New York City. She had straight white-blonde hair that reached just below her shoulder. She looked good, even when she doubted herself. Everyone loved her, and looked up to her in such a way, she was almost a religious figure at Jackson Jr. High. She was the kind of girl you had to like, whether you’ve talked to her or not. This is what the regular Jackson girl thought of Valerie Bishop.    So many girls in Jackson looked up to Valerie, except for the girls who had actually spent their time getting to know her. Skylar, one of Valerie’s friends, thought she knew the most about Valerie than anyone else. Though Skylar spent most of her time auditioning for commercials, memorizing her lines, and drinking water to keep her voice clear, she still had time to spend with Valerie whether she wanted to or not. Valerie always needed to know everything about everybody. It was one of her annoying traits. Valerie felt as if she needed to know everybody’s secret, for whatever reason. You couldn’t keep anything from her.   After school, Valerie spent her time at soccer practice. There, she would meet up with her friend Danielle. She and Danielle were the best players on their middle school team, who both played mainly offence. Danielle wasn’t the smartest girl out there, but she was depending on a soccer scholarship to get her anywhere in life. She really was Valerie’s best friend, though Skylar thought she had that title in the bag.    Things were going great as seventh grade year ended. Valerie had the perfect boyfriend, Danielle had some time to rest from soccer, and Skylar had her very first commercial appearance. But something would happen tat summer that would change their lives forever.    But then, something happened that summer. Valerie and Dani were really bored of Skylar yacking on about her new commercial audition, so they decided to go outside and play soccer (they knew Skylar hated that sport).   So, they went downstairs, through the hallway, and into Valerie’s huge, perfectly watered lawn. Right next to that was a stoned swimming pool, where many of the three girl’s parties were held. There were palm trees surrounding the pool, and the water glistened against the rays of the sun that were pouring down upon Valerie’s backyard. Summer in Jackson was always great.   They played for a little while, using the wooden goal that Valerie’s dad had built. Valerie had told Danni that her dad kept all his tools in the shed, and that they were never to go in there. Obviously, he wasn’t that great of a builder, for there was a piece of wood that hung from the top of the goal. Sometimes when they would kick the ball into the goal, the ball would bounce off the piece of wood and back at us. But they didn’t mind. Anything to keep them away from Skylar.    “Valerie,” Danielle said, grabbing the soccer ball from the ground, and resting it against her hip. “I really have to go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back.”    “’Kay.” Valerie replied as Dani threw her the soccer ball so that she could continue to play.   Danielle left Valerie, a moment that both of them would be reluctant to forget.    Danielle came back outside, just to see Valerie on the ground. She was screaming, and to Danielle’s horror, Valerie’s arm was not attached to her shoulder. In fact, Dani couldn’t even find Valerie’s arm.   She instantly started bawling. She knew from that point on, both their lives were going to be different. She didn’t know what to do, for she didn’t have my phone with me. So Dani bent down next to Valerie, put her hands on her stomach, and cried. She was crying almost as hard as Valerie was.    Then, Skylar came through the door, and stepped outside. She saw Valerie, and instantly took out her phone called the ambulance.   So, that’s the story! Danielle never really wanted to ask Valerie what happened anyway.   Valerie doesn’t play soccer anymore. She stopped hanging out with Danielle, and Danielle stopped hanging out Skylar. As Valerie started fleeing away from Dani and Skylar, a domino affect occurred and their group split. She is okay now, but her arm is missing. Her boyfriend broke up her that summer, for reasons only Valerie and Skylar knew of.    Well, that’s the story about how Valerie came to be. She really isn’t the same anymore. She isn’t the most popular girl anymore either, and she doesn’t play soccer. Now, her role has gone to Danielle.

You’re going to be late for your first day of school!” Her voice was becoming louder, she was running upstairs. Two seconds later, she appeared at my doorway, “Oh my you aren’t even dressed yet! Well hurry, hurry! Timothy is waiting!” Her enthusiasm sickened me.     Mother left the room; her overly put on Chanel perfume sweeping the air. I nearly gagged.         ------   Well, yeah there are probably a lot of errors. This is just the first few paragraphs and I'm just wondering what people think about it.

20090203141348AAfZiAL	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read this type of story? Rate & Review please?	In the Year 2046, the world ran out of natural resources. The nuclear waste spillages caused infertility in most women and society became more dangerous than ever. 10 years later, the Government are offering a "Lifeline", or a way out for people who possess high levels of intelligence. 16 year old Cecil Delaney has lived her life witnessing the madness that some people are resorting to in order to stay alive. The government are under threat from an organisation called "Saligia" whom they have a deadly vendetta against. Yet, there is still good amongst all evil - isn't there?       She decides to go to an interview for the prestigous Lifeline program in the hope of curing the world. She is accepted as a "Life Guard" and helps people. When she meets and falls in love with an elusive Jaeger, he brings her back to reality with a thump. Quickly, her new friends begin to disappear and she makes some disturbing discoveries - like the Government's ulterior motives with the Lifetime program. As soon as she makes this discovery, Saligia  contact her asking for her assistance to bring down the Government once and for all. When good becomes evil, and evil becomes good ... which side does she choose?       ~      Lol, well whaddya think? I mean, if she brought down the government obviously there would be more riot, but if she didn't, then more bad things will happen to society around her. Sucks to be her right now. Thanks :)

20090225015212AAAnIBt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How are men portrayed in "Letters to Alice," by Fay Weldon?	For eg. in pride and prejudce and most of Austen's novels, men are the essential ingredient in a woman's life; her goal in life was to get married. Letters to Alice judges Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice and talks about this topic. I havent gotten around to reading all of it yet. (Only finished the first chapter..) SO in this book    1) what values does it reflect in the ways in which the lives of men are represented. This is what i think the book is trying to say about men : That they are pleasant and good company but clearly not essential or easily replaced.. Thanks in advance, if you have read this novel by any chance....

20090224235833AAzuAmS	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think Twilight Has messed up the idea of the word love?	Okay so I’ve read Twilight... Its not special.. And there no love in it. There lust yes, and Bella likes him. Doesn’t mean she loves him. love is when you care about someone, and you wish there okay, and everything. You LOVE THE PERSON, like your mom or dad, they seem to sometimes act like they hate you, but they do love you (unless the abusive you, then they don’t desver(sp?) you.. or you love back to them)  but Twilight  its claimed to be a good “love” story… for teens? Okay if that is, why not write a book about a girl that goes to a party and does it with some guy (who she thinks is totally hot) she doesn’t know oh and she finds out she got a STD from that guy? Hey look, there even A REAL STORY LINE THERE! Omg. (Sorry making fun of SM) I think Twilight has messed up some peoples idea of love and has gotta holly wood’s idea of love more out there. (a.k.a. lust. Having sex with someone you don’t care about... You just want there body. You don’t care about there thoughts or feelings…) Does anyone else agree with me?       P.s. love is made out of:       You meant a person, you talk to the person, you become friends with the person, you ask the person out, you get it “oh I really do care for the person!” your relation ship gets hard and better then hard again, you guys still go throw it. Love a storm, its hard it’s not easy, even when your married it’s hard, not a walk in the park. Twilight makes it seem that way, or that love is just about sex. Love is more about FEELINGS to one another, the way you guys act, and stuff…       Doesn’t anyone else agree with me? That Twilight probably has bug some peoples minds on what love is?         sorry for some of the Typo's..

So I'm in art and design this semester and we have to have a sketchbook and by the end of the semester our teacher wants us to have at least 30 creative sketches in there. Like, really creative. He showed us an example of one of the sketchbooks from last semester and one of the girls had done an Obama poster like this one:  http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2247/2231...    in nail polish. I have a few ideas, but I'm pretty bad at art and creativity and all. Does anybody have good ideas for some cool sketches?   Thanks :]      P.S. they don't all have to be sketches, he also likes things like collages, abstract, etc. What he said was the harder the sketchbook is to close the better it is. meaning like you can add in a bunch of stuff if you want, glue stuff, etc.

Any way here is what happens.      TITLE - THE BLACK SHADDOW      - She is at home when she is about to cook tea then all the lights go out, the aircon stops working.   - It is raining outside. She goes on er balcony because she lives in a unit and she is talking to her neighbours.   - A big BANG! happens.   - They hear people screaming.   - She runs downstairs to see what happened, and there are dead people on the ground bleeding   - She looks at one person in horror as there is a black shaddow over him sucking his blood (not in a vampire way)   - She screams and runs to the school that is around the corner.   -She runs and at the back of the school there is a gigantic gate which leads to the hills (a place full of green hills) lol   - There are lots of people there trying to get the gate open but they need a padlock.   - They end up getting to the hills.   -There are 10 adults with her and they try to run away as far as they can.   - They hear more loud bangs and wonder what the hell is going on.   - At the end the black shaddows die from infected human blood or human blood that has the flu because black shaddows live on mars and they dont have flus up there.   - The population is low but they gain more people years later.      What do you think? i know it sounds weird lol but it was fun to think up of im 13 by the way. If you have details that could make the story better that would be cool. Thanks! =)

Thanks :]   _____________________   The bitter wind struck my cheeks and I looked mournfully at the town I was leaving. The residents won’t miss me. No one will, because to miss someone, you first must talk to her.   Ever since I can remember, people have disregarded me. By my seventh birthday, I was used to being alone and discovered new ways to pass the time, entertainment not dependent on others.   Today had been a long time coming, but it had hit me all too quick. Nelson, New Zealand, Top of the South, Centre of New Zealand. I still could not comprehend my mother’s choice to mover there.   Nelson itself wasn’t a death sentence. The people there, however, would try to introduce themselves to me. That, I did not looking forward to. I had been a hermit for nine years. I would find it incredibly awkward if someone tried to make friends with me.   I pressed my back against the weatherboards and slid down the wall, exhaling deeply. The wind howled in the distance and a shiver rain through my spine. Rain clouds loomed in the sky overhead, precipitation willing to break through the barriers at any moment.   Mother had left for Christchurch earlier that day, leaving me to say my goodbyes. It was sweet of her, although I did not have any goodbyes to say. I shoved my trunk into the boot of The Baron and climbed into the front seat of The Baron – my red Volkswagen Beetle.   Many thoughts ran through my mind at this moment, such as the notion to run away – but where would I go? I dismissed the thoughts from my mind and turned the key in the ignition. I jumped as the CD in my stereo system started blasting out at me and terrific decibels.   My heart raced as I fumbled to turn the music down. I pressed the clutch down and swung the gear stick into reverse. The Baron back easily out of the driveway and I switched into first, then second and so on. I turned onto the motorway and followed the drag out of town....

How much should I ask for when reselling it now? (Prices are in Canadian, but I don't think it makes that much of a difference)      Here is a pic:    http://www.shreveaudio.com/marshall/avt5... 
20090225011634AA6mYU9	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	This was a hard one to write?	As he squats silently in the corner   Trembling in fear and pain   Knowing that what has happened   For always will remain      He hides himself under his blanket   Never wanting to look out   Hoping that death would find him   Before the devils about      He hears the footsteps closing in   Coming from behind the door   He knows what’s going to happen   The same thing as before      The tears start to fill his eyes   His body has all gone taught   He looks to the heavens for his escape   But salvation is always naught      He hides himself under his blanket   All wrapped with shame and grief   Now looking through adult eyes    He will never find relief

20090224231412AAXc8oW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my story horrible...?	So this is something I just wrote, I'm interested in writing a story and I would just like to know what you think. This is just a beforehand, so like an introduction to the story I guess... Please offer constructive criticism :) Thanks      I watched in amusement as Danielle’s eyes grew wide with excitement. I couldn’t help but laugh.    “You seriously did that?” She asked.    “I seriously did.” I pledged, holding up my left hand.    “Oh. My. God! A normal person gets bored so they go and watch TV. You get bored and decide to announce your love to a guy you just met!”   “I didn’t just meet him. I’ve known him for two weeks. Besides, I thought I loved him!”  I returned, rolling my eyes as though this was the most obvious thing.   “How did he take it?” She questioned, her blue eyes scanning my face for details.    “I somewhat recall the phrase ‘I don’t think of you as more than a friend’ being used.”    “Ouch.” Dani shifted her body toward me and reached out her arms to hug me.   “Just because I got rejected by a guy, doesn’t make me a lesbian Danielle Duke.” We both burst out laughing.   Danielle Duke; dark brown hair, green eyes, tanned skin and killer fashion sense could only mean one thing, she was the hottest thing at school according to the guys. Therefore she wasn’t used to being turned down; unlike me.   I reached out and removed the restricting hair-tie from my bun and watched in the mirror as my black hair rolled down my shoulders. I carefully studied each feature; pale skin, pale blue eyes, high cheekbones and plump lips. At school I was considered an “irregular beauty”; I was beautiful but not hot. I could make a boy interested not enough to make a girlfriend jealous. I moved my hand to my nose and began to fiddle with the piercing on my right nostril. Dani’s nose screwed up in protest at this disgusting habit.    “You are hot Josephine. You will make the boys crazy.” Dani said, almost pleading.   I laughed off the comment but mentally add ... but there’s only one guy I want.   That’s typical Josephine Smith; falling in love with restricted boys.

I am doing research on acting/production in other countries outside of the U.S.  I am trying to get some answers for a show idea.  There are a lot of questions and I really appreciate any answers I get from the yahoo community in India!!      So the first question from the producer are general:      Is it an upper class or a common people thing?      How is film/theatre held in your country?      What are the origins of your local film/theatre industry? Centuries old? Inspired by Hollywood?      What are some common feelings toward American movies?           Actors:   Can you tell me a little bit about your life as an actor in India/Bollywood?      What sort of classes do they make you take?      What sort of skills do they encourage you to have?      What are the qualities that they look for in actors/singers/ etc?      How much control do you have over you as a product?      Is talent and skill more important than the right look?      Are there rehearsals before shoots or you just show up and do it?      Are there any actors unions?      If you don't have an agent, how does one go about getting work?      Is it hard to get your foot in the door?      What are some alternative paths to getting work besides through agents?      Is it possible to make your living acting here?      What do people think about actors famous and otherwise?       Are plays/films/shows done in the native language, in English, or in both?          Production:   Compared to the U.S. do you think production is organized in Bollywood?      Do things change a lot when you get on set?  The script? The set? Your character?      Is it easy to get permits or is bribery a good way to get things done?      Is there some sort of community-supported outlet for theatre people and filmmakers besides the big productions?

20090225020903AAu41z6	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Need some acting tips?	In about two weeks I am going to have to do a preformance in front of my drama class (my assessment for the term). In the preformance I am a sly, somewhat evil character who is meant to be a representation of the greed and selfishness of human beings. I was hoping that I could get a few tips on how to make my preformance as realistic as possible.      The preformance is a mixture of abstract and mime, and we are not allowed to use any objects. So...yes, any help would be appreciated, since at the moment I am very nervous.
