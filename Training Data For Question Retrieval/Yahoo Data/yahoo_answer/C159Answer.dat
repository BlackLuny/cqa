9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	I don't think that any 3 month old should be expected to "entertain" themselves! Just because some mums leave their baby for an hour on a mat doesn't mean that the baby is entertained, they're probably bored stiff. You don't have to dance rings around your baby to keep her amused, just put her in her car seat and place her where she can see you. Talk to her about what you're doing and stuff and just include her in your activities, even if you're just doing the laundry. Don't just give her toys to play with, if you're cooking then give her a spoon to hold and so on. I think that "High Needs" babies (don't doctors just love giving us all a label?) are probably the most intelligent and the most inquisitive children so don't worry about her, if she's reaching all her usual milestones then she sounds fine. And a 3 month-old is still a tiny baby, give her time!|`|dwdLkvgPaa	your baby is only 3 months old...what do you expect from her to entertain herself all day long??? I think 15 mins is pretty good for a baby that young...this is what young babies do...|`|145RUNQHaa	Well said janey33!it really made me laugh when she said the baby would be bored stiff!how right is she!people leave their babys on an activity mat for an HOUR!That is horrible poor baby must be feeling like a zombie they must hypnotise them to do that i m sure!i don t know any babys that would enjoy entertaining themselves for an hour.if your little one is entertaining herself for 15 minutes then that is very good and the best you can hope for!when my children were 3 months old i held them almost all day long!i got on with the housework with them strapped to me in a sling.i think they benefit in the times when they are awake if they recieve constant interaction with people especially you.they love to see a smiling face and an animated voice.your routine sounds normal and don t worry about her not batting/grasping objects both my children didn t really master that until four months.your baby is just right i what a ridiculous label high needs baby is!|`|3fYRi1y4aa	I wouldnt worry about your baby not doing things that other babies are doing just yet.  All babies develop at different rates.  If you are concerned ask your Dr.  But I have had 2 boys and neither one of them would entertain themselves at that age!  Heck they still dont!|`|R1zUIh7taa	I'm going to tell you right now that all those moms were not telling the truth!  15 minutes just fine for a baby this young!  Your baby sounds fine!  Really if you are worried go talk to a doctor and stop reading so many books, it seems to be scaring you!|`|AA11105856	don't feel bad and don't compare yourself to all other all babies learn and do things at different times. maybe your baby is not entertained with what your giving them|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	put baby in a sling or carrier and ..she'll be content and you can do your stuff...|`|s1zitZMOaa	My daughter is almost 3 and I don't ever remember her doing anything for up to an hour by herself (other than sleeping or something she *shouldn't* be doing).     There have been things that entertained her at certain stages longer than others. She loved her jumper/bouncer when she was around 5 months or so - those things you attach to a doorway and they sit in it and jump and swing. She'd jump until she fell asleep. Then when she was around 5 or 6 months I'd put her in her highchair in the middle of the kitchen with a spoon and empty some baby food on the tray. I could clean a good part of the house while she destroyed the kitchen with the baby food. But then I had to clean the kitchen. Right now she is coloring next to me and if I wasn't stopping to color with her every few minutes I would never be able to sit here and type. Some kids just want more attention than others. My sister was like that whereas I wanted to be left alone.|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	Your baby isn't a 'high needs baby'.    Your baby is an INFANT and they all develop according to their own schedule.     Try not to compare your child's rate of progress against other kids.
weE5FxCfaa	i have pcos and i have 4 beautiful children.  metformin would be a really good idea because it can reduce your risk of miscarriage if taken during the first trimester if you get pregnant again.  i have taken metformin to achieve my last 3 pregnancies, i never had to go on clomid but some pcos women use them together with great results.  i am now on metformin again to try for a 5th as my youngest is my only boy and well we want to try to give him a brother.  i have been on it for 2 and 1/2 months and am having my 1st period so it works pretty quickly.  it can take up to 6 months to take full affect, but it is very effective.

I mean, summer time is only three months away, if you got pregnant today, you'd still have 9 months till the baby comes! I'd keep trying because your not guaranteed to get pregnant anytime soon! Talk to your husband about it|`|DgXmTJzYaa	I would be frustrated to. My husband is planning on joining the air force and we are currently both unemployed so if this month doesnt do it for us we are going to wait till after he gets back from bootcamp!

We put our trying on hold for now since bills are coming up and they come before anything else.     Thank you for staying with us !    We love you to !|`|fk9AvB25aa	People keep telling me that kids seam to happen when you least think about trying for a baby. Maybe a break from trying is what you need for now.  I'm in a rough financial spot with my boy friend as well and trying to have kids. We only own maybe less then 10 percent of our house and we are trying to dig our selves out, it seams like taking two steps forward and one giant step back.  Maybe you should show your landlord the gas bill one day, that might get him to shut up and have the pipes fixed. That is under his responsibilities.   My boy friend isn't even around half the time when I'm ovulating because he travels a lot for business. It feels like I'm wasting time having sex some times if we have it when I'm not ovulating. Plus some friends around me are pregnant and I can't help but be jealous of them because they got pregnant so quickly and we have been seriously trying for about 6 months now. I seriously thought I was next to get pregnant on my last cycle but nothing happened.  Keep trying, hopefully you will have lots of kids some time soon.|`|xnhwmontaa	I am so sorry...I hope you get things sorted out..before you know it, it will be summer and you will be pregnant right along with me! *hugs*|`|b97ab27d62fac407e8f40fe52edd9ae1aa	I agree. You would have 9 months to get finances in order and that is if it happens right away. We must be on the same cycle because I should be ovulating soon. ( I hope). No high detected on the fertility monitor yet, but I can feel it. Ovulation cramps and cervix is high and soft.     Good luck with what ever you decide!
vue9NOhYaa	He should eat as much as he wants.    As a rough average, a baby needs about 2-3 ounces per pound of body weight, so 28 ounces sounds just about right for his size.    EDIT: Several people said they were already giving solids. 3 months is FAR too early for solids. 6  months is the usual time to begin them, and never EVER before 4 months.|`|cQzXM870aa	every 3-4 hours 150-180ml per eating + juice from 1 apple before night sleep|`|hXoUFWL1aa	my 3 month old son eats 5 oz every 3-4 hrs.|`|3fYRi1y4aa	When my baby was 3 months old I started him out on the rice cereal mixed with formula.  Not very much at all he will let you know when he is full.  Probably wont like it very much while gets used to the texture.  Once he holds that down and gets the hang of it I would take baby food and mix just a lil in there to start giving it some flavor.  Only one kind every 3 days or so so that you can tell if he has alergies or not.  You're mommy and you know best you'll get the hang of it!  A website that I love is www.babycenter.com.  Lots of good advice on there and it has weekly newsletters for your babies development.|`|huRnrj0Waa	My baby is 3 1/2 months old and weighs 16 pounds. She eats about 2 teaspoon fulls of the Gerber baby food  2's and about 4-5 ounces for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And inbetween she eats a 6 oz bottle. She eats every 3 hours. So from 8am to 8pm she eats about 5 times a day and she sleeps all night so she don't wake for any feeding after 8pm. I also add rice cereal to all of her bottles. Hope this helps you out!
njLalVIwaa	You know. I had problems in school too, nothing like that but I was a loner, a nobody. I never got teased to my face often but it happen from time to time. I stood alone, kept to myself, quiet never said a word unless I had to. The one time a guy was handing out flyers for a gig to everyone I was with and never gave me, so the girls said "shame, what about Candice?" and he said "I was told not to give to retards" even though I wouldn't have gone anyway that really hurt me. The girls wanted to laugh. Another time I was sitting in substitution, when our teacher was absent we would each go to a different class for that period, and I went to my class and these girls started having a go at me, I already found it hard to go to school everyday, I would gag, cry and freak out, they made it worse, and you know, they won't even remember me one day, but it will haunt me for life, whenever I hear their names I will see red. I left school shortly after I couldn't go, it was bad, I shortly after got pregnant and now I have a 3 month old son with one of the most desired guys and hes all mine, but he wasn't from my school, but his cousin was and she HATES me! So F**k them, they won't touch you. They jealous of you cause you smarter, they won't remember you one day. If they touch you then tell the principal. You don't want to end up like me, I am enjoying my life but I get laughed at a lot more now. They will get over being so insecure one day.|`|Y2k81CWWaa	I know it might be hard, but you have to tell someone. If you don't want to tell a parent, tell a teacher you trust or the guidance counselor. I've actually had the same problem, and telling someone helped a lot. I has someone threaten to shoot me because I was talking too loudly. I told my teacher because I was freaked out, and the kid got suspended and never bothered me again. This was last year. DEFINATELY tell someone.|`|MCeh0uIaaa	tell your guidence counselour. they will get seriously punished. no good person in your school, and trust me most of them are good people.|`|hOGAgVASaa	TELL your principle!  im 16 years old!  and im really popular and im totally against bullying!  just go and tell your pprinciple  TRUST me !  you dont need these girls bullying you!  urgg this really makes me mad hearing these it makes me wanna beat the C*AP outa them .. hope everything gets better!  i wish you the best! xoxox|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	You need to tell your mom.  Imagine the burden she would carry if you didn't tell her and something terrible happened to you.    Talk to your mom, notify the school, if things don't get better, talk to the school board or switch schools.  I'm sorry you are going through this.|`|e1da3ff675cf372977d80c07d733416baa	You should tell the school officials about it. If you are that scared you really should tell someone in the school even if you don't know who the kids are. You could point them out to the principal.     I was never good with names and once when I was getting picked on I had to point them out in class. It was a little bit embarrassing but they never picked on me again|`|gKllAGmnaa	use your right to bear arms right...no jk just tell th  principal  plus there not going to kill u because the they go through hell also|`|IueVJbtraa	you do the only thing you can do either be a bigger person an walk away or jus wave to them an say hi hater... you could also jus stand up to them an tell them stop talking like that|`|49LiABmvaa	aw sweetie i feel so bad for you!  well as much as everyone always says "if you just ignore them they'll go away" that is not true!  the only way to get rid of a bully is to take action  i know you think it's bad now but if those girls aren't stopped now it will only get worse  i watched this movie called "odd girl out" and alexa vega is in it  you should really watch this movie it's really inspiring to girls who have or are being bullied  good luck & it hope things get better!|`|MsLKIJWJaa	I know it is hard not telling your mom but think about it if something bad happens to you and your not there for her. That would be the worst. I suggest you talk to your counselor at school and ask her to tell your mom or dad or any other relative in a subtle way so it doesn't get out of hand. I also think you shouldn't walk alone in school if you have bullies after you. Don't stand up to them because then it will just suck. I think just speak out because then you will be the one to make a change. I hope everything goes well. I do think that you should speak out though it makes me sad to hear these types of things.
0nb1rQhnaa	I only used tap water. We asked the Dr and she said it was fine. We have city water.|`|zwctZ812aa	You can, or you can just boil tap water.  It's perfectly safe that way.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yes because fluoridated water can cause fluoridosis of the adult teeth.  Also tap, well, and spring water may have excessive levels of mineral salts or worse contaminants like lead.  Boiling will not eliminate these and can increase the levels because of evaporation (the minerals and heavy metals don't evaporate which is why distilled water is just water nothing else at all)    http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/positi...   ADA Interim Guidance: Infant Formula    The ADA offers these recommendations so parents, caregivers and health care professionals who are concerned have some simple and effective ways to reduce fluoride intake from reconstituted infant formula.        * Breast milk is widely acknowledged as the most complete form of nutrition for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends human milk for all infants (except for the few for whom breastfeeding is determined to be harmful).        * For infants who get most of their nutrition from formula during the first 12 months, ready-to-feed formula is preferred to help ensure that infants do not exceed the optimal amount of fluoride intake.        * If liquid concentrate or powdered infant formula is the primary source of nutrition, it can be mixed with water that is fluoride free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis. Examples are water that is labeled purified, demineralized, deionized, distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water. Many grocery stores sell these types of drinking water for less than $1 per gallon.        * The occasional use of water containing optimal levels of fluoride should not appreciably increase a childs risk for fluorosis.    Parents and caregivers should consult with their pediatrician, family physician or dentist on the most appropriate water to use in their area to reconstitute infant formula. Ask your pediatrician or family physician whether water used in infant formula should be sterilized first (sterilization, however, will not remove fluoride).|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	I boil tap water, then put the tea kettle in the fridge until i'm ready to make the bottles.|`|huRnrj0Waa	My baby is 3 1/2 months old and I just use regular bottled water.

This was the name of many old Gaelic kings and noblemen.     Eamon p: ay+mun  An English name brought to Ireland by the Normans, probably a variation on Edmund. Signifies a guardian or protector. One of the more popular Irish baby names in modern times because of Eamon De Valera, the famous President of Ireland from 1959  73.     Emmet p: "ehm+et"  Derives from old Saxon name Amete. Long one of the most widely used baby boy names because of its association with Robert Emmet, a great orator who led the unsuccessful 1798 rebellion against England. Emmet was executed for high treason.     Fergus ir: Fearghus, Fearghais p: fer+gus  Translates as strength and associated with warriors, but also thought to derive from fear. Fergus was one of the famous kings of Ulster.     Flann ir: Flan, Flannery p: flahn  Translates as blood red. Many kinds, saints and scholars had this name. A particularly famous one, Flann Feorna, was King of Kerry, and is related to the OConnor family. It was popular into the early 20th century, but is today one of the unusual baby boy names in Ireland.     Gerard ir: Gearoid, Gareth p: jer+ard  One of the most common Irish baby names for boys in Ireland, sometimes shortened to Gary. From an old Irish word that translates as shining.     Kevin ir: Kevan p: kev+in  Derived from old Irish name Coemhghin. Variously translated as gentle child and beautiful offspring. St. Kevin founded a major monastery at Glendalough, County Wicklow.     Liam ir: Uillium p: lee+am  The Irish version of William, which in tern is originally a German name meaning protector.

I went to my GP, with the evidence,(its embarrassing to show your undies to the doctor, but he can see for himself how much loss.)he got his collegue in for a second opinon, after a chat and examination, i was told to go home and take it easy........with a two year old at home.. !

But im glad i saw my GP about it.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, at 5/12 months, that puts you around 22 weeks roughly...which makes a miscarriage very unlikely, considering they will deliver at 24 weeks if it is urgent.  I would be in seeing my OB ASAP if I were you|`|8uiH6iRbaa	make an appointment with your GP as soon as possible.    in the mean time    * go to bed and rest  * keep yourself cool (don't over heat)  * drink plenty of water  * stay calm don't stress    as you are 5 months + the chances of it been a miscarriage are slim but not ruled out     if it is a miscarriage then you could be in for a lot of bleeding and pain all in all a rough ride     but i think this is unlikely|`|9qQFHK2Qaa	no it doesnt mean anyrthing bad but next time you have an appointment tell your midwife.try to take it easy.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	if you have spotting that lasts more than 2 days and is accompanied by abdominal pains, then go to the hospital.  in a lot of women, spotting does happen for no known reason. It can also be caused by a UTI that has gone un-noticed, or having sex.   When i had a m/c i started bleeding all of a sudden like i had my period.    If you are experiancing any pain, try not to stress, but definately see a doctor- even if the outcome is just u feeling better, it will be worth it|`|HUrYSp4oaa	if u have bleeding at this stage then it could be other reasons than miscarriage particularly if no cramps, such as low lying placenta. whatever it needs to be checked by a doctor or midwife asap.  good luck.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I have never had a miscarriage but my daughter-in-law has.

9cu82009aa	It mean your cervix is getting ready to deliver within the next few weeks. I don't know how long mine was soft for, but I went in on the 20th for my appointment (I made them do an internal) and my cervix was soft, they booked me in for an induction for the 22nd (39wks, because I wanted an epidural, have PTSD, and I had quick labours, 16mins and 1hr, with the second and third), by the time she checked me on the day I was already 5cm dilated so I would have went in to labour that day or the next anyways... plus I went to the toilet twice before she checked me too which was an indicator that labour was near.   Don't worry, your cervix might be soft for a few weeks, it might be soft for only a week, it just depends on when your body is ready.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Before a cervix starts to thin out it has to soften, the cervix needs to thin out before it starts dilating - it just means you're on target for a normal delivery.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	the cervix softens when it gets ready to dialate|`|72cef19a31314b3ec0ec5517673d7929aa	That your body is getting ready.

Some girls look more like their fathers side of the family.    I'm 18 and a lot of people I know who were slim as youngsters filled out when they hit their teens and many of them are the exact build of their mothers and also look like their moms too. I am lucky though because my mom has a really slim build which I have too so unlike the other people I know I have never filled out at all.     So there is a good chance of you looking like your mom some time in the future. Its all down to genetics, some bulkier people have really good diets but are never slim because no one in their family is and the genes are passed on.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Not necessarily but it is possible. After my sister had her baby she kept on ALOT of weight. I have had 2 babies and am pregnant with my third and so far I have not gotten heavy.|`|QhHd8MIYaa	It is SOMETIMES true that you start looking like your mom, but in my case, I look more like my aunt all the time, and both my parents are normal hight, but I'm only six foot three and done growing.

Its not really anything to worry about. In earlier pregnancy I had alot of cramping that lasted for a couple weeks. Then it stopped a little, but it still comes and goes now. Don't be worried or scared about it. Its just the uterus growing and stretching. Its fine, unless the pain just gets unbearably painful or the pain goes all to one side, then talk to a doctor about it. but I think your fine, also if your not seeing any blood thats a good sign. good luck.|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Because your uterus is growing and being stretched.

In one study, no effects on the nursing infant were reported (9), but the slight delay in establishing feeding was a cause for concern (11). Milk:plasma ratios in four women who had received 3.5 mg orally of lorazepam 4 hours earlier ranged from 0.15 to 0.26 (9). The mean milk concentration was 8.5 ng/mL. In another study, 5 mg of oral lorazepam was given 1 hour before labor induction and the effects on feeding behavior were measured in the newborn infants (12). During the first 48 hours, no significant effect was observed on volume of milk consumed or duration of feeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers the effects of lorazepam on the nursing infant to be unknown, but they may be of concern if exposure is prolonged (13).    Never trust the medical establishment to make these decisions for you. They are collectively idiots.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/09815257...

Effects in Breastfed Infants:  In one case, the newborn infant of a mother taking 2.5 mg of lorazepam orally twice daily for 5 days after delivery showed no signs of sedation.[2]     http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa...  Benzodiazepines    Benzodiazepines are used frequently in postpartum women to control anxiety, panic disorder, and seizures. The risk of breastfeeding while using those drugs remains a topic that is controversial and underresearched. The AAP (2001) categorizes benzodiazepines as "drugs for which the effect on nursing infants is unknown, but may be of concern" (p. 776). Even though the guidelines do not preclude the use of benzodiazepines in women who breastfeed, many postpartum women are routinely counseled not to nurse their infants.    Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome was described in infants who were chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero, and floppy infant syndrome has been documented in newborns exposed to benzodiazepines during labor (Mortola, 1989). Even though a scattering of studies report drowsiness and decreased sucking reflex in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk (Suri, Altshuler, Burt, & Hendrick, 1998), it is important to keep in mind that all infants studied were also exposed in utero.    In infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk only, no neurobiological changes were reported (Birnbaum et al, 1999). It is widely accepted that all benzodiazepines are rapidly absorbed and distributed into breast milk and peak concentration occurs in approximately 60 minutes. It is known that benzodiazepines have long pediatrie half-lives, and higher drug levels in the infant can and do occasionally occur (Hale, 2002).    As a rule, drugs in the benzodiazepine family are not ideal for breastfeeding (Table 7). It is apparent that shorter-acting benzodiazepines (alprazolam, lorazepam) are safest for use during lactation, as long as their use is short-term, intermittent, low-dose, or occurs after the first week postpartum. Any time an infant is exposed to a benzodiazepine, monitoring for central nervous system (CNS) depression and apnea is advised (Hale, 2002).      http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVApr...  In other cases, the drug is not AAP-approved, yet Dr. Hale has fewer concerns. For the listing on Metronidazole Vaginal Gel, the AAP classifies this drug as a "drug whose effect on nursing infants is unknown but may be of concern." Dr. Hale adds information from a study finding "plasma levels following administration are exceedingly low" and "milk levels following intravaginal use would probably be exceedingly low." Again, Lorazepam is also listed by the AAP as a "drug whose effect on nursing infants is unknown but may be of concern." Dr. Hale adds more specificity by referring to a study in which "there were no untoward effects noted in any of the infants," and concludes that "it would appear from these studies that the amount of Lorazepam provided via milk would be clinically insignificant under most conditions."    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/09a-drugs...  Does the addition of a small amount of medication to the mothers milk make breastfeeding more hazardous than formula feeding? The answer is almost never. Breastfeeding with a little drug in the milk is almost always safer. In other words, being careful means continuing breastfeeding, not stopping.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/61244...  Oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam and, especially, flunitrazepam, appear to penetrate the human placenta more slowly than diazepam, but the clinical significance of this phenomenon remains uncertain. All of these derivatives appear in human milk, but only high clinical doses might be expected to exert a possible effect on the nursing newborn.    http://www.drugsafety.adisonline.com/pt/...  In general, the drug should be given in the lowest effective dose, guided by maternal serum or plasma drug concentration monitoring. If breast feeding is avoided at times of peak drug levels in milk, the exposure of the infant can be reduced to some extent. As breast milk has considerable advantages over formula milk, the benefits of continuing breast feeding should always be taken into consideration in the risk-benefit analysis.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/78811...  There is evidence that clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, and oxazepam are excreted into breast milk. The published data indicate that the levels detected in breast milk are low; therefore, the suckling infant is unlikely to ingest significant amounts of the drug in this way. Problems may arise if the infant is premature or has been exposed to high concentrations of drug either during pregnancy or at delivery.    http://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/lorazepam...  Lorazepam Lactation Warnings    Lorazepam is excreted into human milk in small amounts. Sedation is a theoretic concern but has not been reported with lorazepam. The manufacturer states that lorazepam should not be administered to breast-feeding women, unle
5DJcir9saa	I think about 15 minutes is normal at that age.  My baby likes his activity mat but gets bored with it after awhile, especially if I'm not right there to talking with him while he's playing.  My son is 4 months and just recently he started actually grabbing at toys, so she's right on pace with that as well.  At this age, what babies like most is face time.  They just want to be with you, see you, and hear your voice.  So, no I don't think you have a high needs baby.  I think she sounds like most other babies.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	I don't know what "high needs baby" means, but I think it's pretty normal for a baby that age to not be able to entertain themselves for long.  My son needs lots of stimulation and the only thing he likes to do for more than 15 minutes is be held...  But even then you have to change his position, let him sit, let him stand, etc.  Maybe she just loves to be with her mommy!  :-)  My son is 4 1/2 months and is just starting to reach for things.  I wouldn't worry, all babies are different!|`|AA10441533	You have got to be kidding. 3 months is way to young to just sit there and play on their own. They look towards HUMAN CONTACT!|`|wtER7TAbaa	I completely understand how you are feeling.  My daughter was the sme exact way.  I mean I felt as if I could not do anything, I mean even go the bathroom without her crying.  I would hear similiar things from mothers saying there babies love there swing, bouncy seatm play mat, my daughter had no interest,  Now one hour is a rather long time but she would not eve last five minutes.     Now she is seven months and let me tell you things have changed.  She loves her baby einsteen jumper, and entertains herself far longer then before.  She is still rather needy but she is a baby I expected that.  She does not like strangers; at all!  But all babies are different I think it sounds like ours are just a bit more needy.  It will get better!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I say fifteen minutes of laying down while awake for a 3 month old sounds like a pretty content 3 month old.    I don't think your baby is high needs by any means.    And anyone who leaves a 3 month old alone to lay on a play mat for an hour is being pretty neglectful of her baby.      Get a carrier and carry your baby around, this will keep her amused, she will like the motion and the constant change of scenery.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	My son wanted to be held or in the swing and that was it.  I don't really see babies at 3 months entertaining themselves, at least not mine!  And btw 15 minutes is an astronomical length of time for a baby at 3 months!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I don't think you have a high needs baby at all.

Your daughter sounds perfectly normal to me, and not "high needs" in any way.  This is why new moms don't get much done.|`|zwctZ812aa	My son is 3 months old and does not entertain himself for longer than a ten minute period.  I'm lucky if I get that out of him.  I don't think I would set my two month old down on an activity mat and let him play by himself even if he would have done so happily...babies that age need interaction.  I would not say you havea  high needs baby at all.  That seems very normal to me.  My son just started grabbing and batting at toys on his playmat in the last week or so...he is 13 weeks.  I do the same thing....playmat, bouncy chair, tummy time, walking, exersaucer, mobile...etc etc etc
5nk13Ifkaa	The average baby doesn't crawl until after 8 months old, and some much later, so you have nothing to worry about there. My 2 hated being put on their tummies and both crawled around 8 1/2 months old. Also my 2 had little bald spots on the backs of their head, caused from lying/sleeping on their backs. This is nothing to be concerned about and it will grow in, in time. As for the food, just keep trying a little everyday. She will come around. Don't give up, offer her a small amount each day and eventually she will get the hang of it.|`|cI4piIXmaa	I'm not a mom, but I wouldn't be too worried about her not crawling. some kids because of weight and other things just start crawling later. my cousin was the same age and he loved being held, and hadn't started cruising arounbd yet.

She never slept on it though. She start crawling when she was 6months. She will be 1 years old on feb.14 and she is already trying to walk. she don't really say mommy allot but she does say da da allot. Your baby will catch up she probably just wants you to carry her around LOL!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	First off switch peds fast, any dr that discourages tummy time is a quack.    Secondly, balding in an infant on the back of the head is completely normal.  They spend a lot of time on there backs and their hair is very fine, so it rubs off easily.   Babies do get flat spots, try rotating which way there head is during naps and bedtime, tummy time helps, and once the start getting active, sitting up, and crawling around the flat spot begins to go away.    No need to push baby foods, some 7 month olds simply aren't ready, or perhaps she doesn't like the baby food.  Try mashing a fresh banana to start.    As far as not crawling, completely normal, but you need to do tummy time so she can develop the muscles used in crawling.    Talking can happen any time now, she may say her first word in a week, she may not say it until a year.  ITs good that she is making different noises at this age.  Encourage and promote speech by talking to her regularly.|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	Don't worry she'll crawl when she wants to.  She might never even crawl.  My nephew was lazy and same as your daughter, hated tummy time.  He completely skipped it and went straight to walking.  My daughter is 7 mos and 3 wks and just started actively crawling yesterday.  But for a whole month already she's been on all fours swaying.  I gave her lots of tummy time though.  She started stage 1 solids at 3 months, I started adding cereal to her bottles at 1 1/2 months and started stage 2 at 4 months.  At 5&6 months I would give her bits of cookies (the realy soft ones that turned mushy with her saliva) and at 7 months now that girl eats everything!  Last night she ate bits of chicken and peas (I just squish it in my fingers a little bit so she just knaws on it and swallows it without chocking).  Talking, well she just recently started saying "da da da" but doesnt really associate it to anyone, she just babbles.    Dont worry. All babies are different. Yours is just fine!    Edit: Oh and also, my daughte still has that darn bald spot and she's been sitting up since 4 months. It's taking FOREVER to grow even a little bit of hair and the sides are super long, I can grab them in pig tails!

It would be rude unless you have a great reason not to go.    It's just a babyshower! Don't put money then whats the big deal?|`|HyXGhW8iaa	not everyone partys the same. go! dont be close-minded...you might enjoy it. why miss out on if only because theyll be doing something different.|`|1bnhwGACaa	asking for money is tacky   and you buy yellow and green for gender neutral not pink and blue   if you don't feel comfortable then don't go|`|BGpm57ROaa	I don't know why they would want pink AND blue. I would think they would want neutral colors such as green or yellow or beige.  That's just strange.    I think the savings account thing is nice, but I would be hesitant to put money in there since the parents could spend it on anything they wanted.    Don't go if you don't want to. It's not impolite.|`|TVgLSwpJaa	I've never heard of asking for both pink and blue!  Most people expect items in "neutral" items.  As for asking for $, I've never heard of that either.     Here's my suggestion to you...Definitely go to the shower.  Buy a neutral item and include a gift receipt.  As for the money jar, throw $5 bucks in if someone directly asks you to contribute.  If not, don't give any money.  Just because someone asks for something doesn't mean you have to do it. :-)  Have fun at the shower!!|`|ioZeveazaa	Just get her a Gift Card to a store.. As for the jar, don't put any money in if you don't want. A gift is plenty enough.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Tacky, tacky, tacky.  You don't tell guests what gift to give and you certainly don't ask for money.  If you choose to stay home that would be fine.  If you want to give her niece a gift that would be very sweet of you but nothing says you have to follow their inappropriate requests.|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	Well the blue and pink thing I think it's ok but I don't think putting a jar to gather money is appropriate not only for a baby shower but for anything.    I think that baby showers should be about sharing the moment with the family and friends and receiving gifts and good wishes of your guests.|`|AA11763588	Instead of buying clothes, just buy like bottles and bath stuff.    If you want to donate you can, but you shouldn't feel obligated.    I don't really see a problem with it. I think she should have said buy neutral colors cause now the mom to be will have to take things back because they are the wrong color, but that's just me.

AA11512011	Please Please take a test. That could have been implantation bleeding.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	First of all, the symptoms that you are describing are all signs of pregnancy. A light spotting in your underwear could be implantation bleeding, meaning that you would be pregnant.

You know you could have prevented this stress your going through right by NOT having sex....
qImMwhUHaa	Yes you should be able to. You can when you are 16 in most states. Whether you can take it online or not depends on the program the local GED school has. Most have an online program and you just go in for the testing.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Ask a doctor not good for a kid.|`|PKUtKIRfaa	no its not!!! Take her to the dr.

Does he seem distressed?  Is the poop really runny or just soft?|`|zwctZ812aa	That's fine...my baby pooped that much at that age.  Around 2 1/2 months he slowed down to about 4 times a day.  He is breastfed though.  I wouldn't worry about it.|`|HS44HUrgaa	yes thats normal for little kids|`|nANyAvzgaa	Totally. Yes!|`|YAwvszITaa	i believe it is normal but to be sure call the dr and ask him so you can be a complete ease about this matter.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	As long as its not diarrhea its fine. Maybe your changing his diaper to fast and hes not done pooping either...i would give him a minute or two longer before changing to make sure hes done. =)|`|OLW0Irbhaa	It would be normal for a breastfed baby but that sounds like a lot for a formula fed baby.  I would double check with the doctor.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	I had the same issue.....but what I realized is that she really didn't poop that much I just caught her "midpoop" gross I know.  So it might have seemed like she was pooping constantly she just wasn't done when I changed her.  And yes soft is ok.  Just not watery.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	my son is six weeks old and still poops about that many times a day lol.  its normal.|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	yess|`|v0rItkjkaa	No, he is going to explode|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	what is poop?|`|EK3nwsAcaa	yep its fine|`|wigtXCBTaa	poop is another way to spell baby    it's perfectly normal|`|dm1MuyYjaa	yes|`|vEkn39wBaa	your getting married how stupid baby sexer|`|8jsoK3zdaa	only your doctor could give you a for sure answer.  but why are some people that answer so immature and stupid?|`|AA10313787	that is their job you know but you might want to make sure he is not allergic. something similar happen with both my kids and they had to be switched to soy based formula|`|CAAcoqtYaa	The people next door would say EEWWWWWWWWWW because they wonder how you know it's soft. 99.9% sure you touched it lol xD|`|vKvNDPbDaa	thats alot for a non-breastfed baby.  you may need to get his formula changed again he may have intolerance.   ask your doc if u should try nutamigen.|`|I8leFJPJaa	lol. Yeah thats normal. He's prolly jus adjusting to the change in milk. But for the 1st few months his poop will be that way till u switch him to solid foods & stuff.  But jus check w/ ur doctor for better facts. 8^)|`|CRhS02q8aa	It is very normal.  Your baby's stool will not harden until he has been introduced to cereal and other solid foods.  Make sure you keep their litte backside clean to help prevent any rashes that can occur b/c of the frequency.  As long as your baby is eating well and is not constantly fussy, everything should be ok.  Babies with upset tummies tend to cry a lot more.|`|XvBYCFKGaa	My baby is almost a year and drinking prosobee because it is the only thing she could hold down and she never pooped more than 1-2 times daily.

It is the greatest book to have. Its the only book that you will every need.  What to Expect the First Year  by Heidi Eisenberg Murkoff, Arlene Eisenberg, Sandee E. Hathaway, Sharon Mazel    It is perfect to know what is right and what to expect every step of the way.  Hopes this helps.|`|2sXqm4u9aa	YES, especially if on breast milk.  Remember all this bady is getting are liquids and his poop will be soft.  Sometimes the formulas contain iron and babies have problems with that.  They do make formulas without iron.  But he is a infant and that's what they do.|`|aPIkuTqVaa	Yes..its all they do. The poop will start to change colors and consistencys over time. Your baby is fine dont worry.|`|a5f953be88e6808fa3af2ed7c0fd0aa2aa	yeah, it is very normal and messy however, I would love to have the opportunity to do it over again.|`|NNkY0WUdaa	yes that is completlley normal i think he might be a bit constepated actually they should poop around 20 times a day if it is watery and 15 times if it has liittle nuts in it|`|kLlSntibaa	Did he poop as much before your doctor changed his milk? If no ask a doctor.
okgr5aPCaa	How is she going to get Aids from the girls at school like?  Do they all inject unsafely at breaktime?      Do you know how you get Aids?  You have to contract the virus HIV first. HIV is contracted via bodily fluids - you can catch it through unpprotected sexual intercourse (intercourse being man-on-woman or man-on-man, not girl-on-girl), or through the blood (not just touching the blood of someone with it, the blood has to get into your system... for example if you both have a cut, and their blood goes into your cut (rare) or if a needle is used to inject (drugs) by someone with HIV, then by someone without it without the needle being steralised in between. You cant get it from hugging, kissing (it would take like 3 buckets full of saliva passing between you to get it this way and this is impossible hah), masturbation (unless both are undressed and there is a chance seamen from the guy will enter the females vagina) or oral (unless above also)  HIV eventually matures into full-blown Aids, meaning that your immune system shuts down and you can no longer fight disease.      Trust me, your daughter isn't going to get Aids from girls at school - even if she does like to look at them naked.      P.S. How do you have a 14-year-old daughter if you're a 20 year old 'Chaste' whose hymen isn't yet broken and who is living as a 'camp and feminine' male?  Odd.    Grow up.|`|09xCfB9Faa	If she is the light of your life it wouldnt matter to you if she was a lesbian or not! If she is happy you should be hapy an secondly i doubt that she will catch aids from girls at school do you expect her to be having sex there or somethin? thirdly grandchildren should be the last thing you should think of you have still have many years or being a parent to your daughter.x|`|QGP930C6aa	lol sorry this made me chuckle a bit as not as many girls as you think her age have had sex let alone have HIV. But, i think she actually has less chance of gettin HIV is she is a lesbian. and lesbians can still have children through artificial insemination. and as for her helping around the house if she wont help you stop giving her stuff.     and if you love her you wont care what she is but i do kinda know what you mean     good luck :)    btw its probably best you dont look on her computer again as thats the kind of thing that could make her hate you|`|OD3FqMaKaa	you are a parent?      I doubt it|`|ZKm894kfaa	Really? QUIT TROLLING!!!|`|horefBCyaa	you can't prevent her from getting AIDS. only she can. you just have to sit her down and discuss things with her and hope she makes the right choices.  as for stopping her from being lesbian-i wouldn't try. you're only going to push her away and risk her leaving your life.|`|19ffba4361dcf9c1511f4e3daa996315aa	lmao@ lesbean|`|3LvlXDOAaa	..and just how exactly do you know if any of those girls have any kind of disease?|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	I think you are being over protective.

Yeah yeah I know you don't want her to have sex this early (and I agree) but teens nowadays are not like the ones back in the old times, they have sex, and early, so make her understand the importance of using protection.|`|KUZsgJqwaa	its kinda hard to get aids from girls.  and a person is either a lesbian/gay or bi or straite  and as her mother you should accept the fact your child might like girls.  who cares if you dont get grandchildren?    its your daughter who counts right now.|`|nidCgr73aa	And on your other question you were a virgin?

Further, HIV/AIDS has complicated efforts to fight poverty, improve health, and promote development by:2   Diminishing a persons ability to support, work and provide for his or her family. At the same time, treatment and health-care costs related to HIV/AIDS consume household incomes. The combined effect of reduced income and increased costs impoverishes individuals and households.       Deepening socioeconomic and gender disparities. Women are at high risk of infection and have few options for providing for their families. Children affected by HIV/AIDS, due to their own infection or parental illness or death, are less likely to receive an education, as they leave school to care for ailing parents and younger siblings.       Straining the resources of communities  hospitals, social services, schools and businesses. Health care workers, teachers, and business and government leaders have been lost to HIV/AIDS. The impact of diminished productivity is felt on a national scale.  Through unprecedented global attention and intervention efforts, the rate of new HIV infections has slowed and prevalence rates have leveled off globally and in many regions. Despite the progress seen in some countries and regions, the total number of people living with HIV continues to rise.   In 2007, globally, about 2 million people died of AIDS, 33 million were living with HIV and 2.5 million people were newly infected with the virus.1       HIV infections and AIDS deaths are unevenly distributed geographically and the nature of the epidemics vary by region. Epidemics are abating in some countries and burgeoning in others. More than 90 percent of people with HIV are living in the developing world.3       There is growing recognition that the virus does not discriminate by age, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status  everyone is susceptible. However, certain groups are at particular risk of HIV, including men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDUs), and commercial sex workers (CSWs).       The impact of HIV/AIDS on women and girls has been particularly devastating. Women and girls now comprise 50 percent of those aged 15 and older living with HIV.1       The impact of HIV/AIDS on children and young people is a severe and growing problem. In 2007, 420,000 children under age 15 were infected with HIV and 290,000 died of AIDS.1, 4 In addition to the estimated 2.1 million children living with HIV/AIDS, about 15 million children have lost one or both parents due to the disease.1, 4       There are effective prevention and treatment interventions, as well as research efforts to develop new approaches, medications and vaccines.       The sixth Millennium Development Goal (MDG) focuses on stopping and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015.       Global funding is increasing, but global need is growing even faster  widening the funding gap. Services and funding are disproportionately available in developed     but my opinion is sit and talk to her shes young and needs guidance from you be there for her whatever she dedcides and trust that she knows what she wants out of life!!!|`|l9ab36z4aa	How do you know the girls have AIDs? What kind of mother are you? You need to talk to her, ask her if she really is a lesbian talk to her about becoming active .|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Firstly, you can't is the direct answer.  She is 14 and it is already a strange age and place to be - adolescence is neither child nor adult but is a transition period where hormes are kicking in and she (along with thousands of other adolescence) don't feel they fit in anywhere.  There are exams or prep at least and alot of pressure at school not to mention groups that have mingled harmoniously for years seem to now be falling apart at the seams - peer pressure etc.    Yr daughter is exploring that's all - actually I have one straight for ward piece of info about content in yr Q !!  You said "How will I get grandchildren?"  Well this is NOT YR RIGHT AT ALL.  I have 16yr old daughter and have been through same as you - it is normal - yes hard to grasp at times but we as the parents just need to give them space TO BE (whatever that is)   You don't have the right to be actually applying the peer pressure I wrote of earlier - this is HER life and maybe children do not form part of her future.  My 16 yr old is at college F/T and is training to be a Prof Chef and then wants to go in RAF.  She has NO intention of having kids - good for her I say.  This is her life NOT mine.      What if she is a lesbian ?  This is your own prejudice that's all.  I'm sure she isn't - it is just natural to explore. At age oif about 10 I played nurses with my best friend and we had our knicks off I didn't think anything of it.  It was just once but I'm not a lesbian.  It is my first early sexual memory that's all that was 38 yrs ago.   I am in long hetrosexual relationship for many yrs and have 3 lovely kids one who is 16, 7 and 5.     If you want to help and support yr daughter then just be the information gatherer.  Source books and leave them around she will pick them up in time and take them off and read them in her way and absorb the info.  If she is Aids aware - as in sexual health and ensuring she keeps herself safe at all times then this is as far as you can go.  You have done your bit.  You cannot prevent her from getting Aids, pregnant, clamydia or any other STD's.    My daughter has said that when she is ready she wants me to go to the Dr with her to go get the pill.  I thought this was the BIGGEST compliment I could have had - I've actually arrived and been accepted as a friend as well as a parent, yet I consider myself not to be of the lenient type.        WOW Kudos for ol' mum !!       You have to remember - children are here ON LOAN to us.  We do not own them we are merely custodians and have been given the privilege of guiding them along the way in the best possible vein we can.  Now, if she still turns out to be Lesbian then you need to get help and support for you my dear as I think it is you who will need the shoulder.  Would you rather see her in a loveless marriage with hidden domestic violence and possibly even rape - but well that's ok cos you have the 2 lovely grandkids to show off to the neighbours or be in a loving relationship of a different kind but she is simply the happiest she could ever be and shines through in verythng she does - has fab career, no debts, owns own house, has lovely garden, has fab holidays and is popular ?     I realise I won't get yr 10 points - I didn't really answer it for that.  I just feel for both of you.  You are clearly concerned but also have yr own hidden agenda - PLS DON'T you have no right and I trust you can see this for what it is.  I'm not having a go and thrashing you when you feel down already but you need to get some perspective here for the both of you.       If you are in UK try get her to call these ppl for totally independent advice and helpful support.  If you can't do it then it is yr duty to provide her with the friend or ally or support she MAY need.  Sometimes it is about recognising when to walk away and keep schtum - sorry yes it is painful and I've had to do it.  I'm no saint mum by the way.   But you know when she was born I said to her that I was going to be the best mum in the world to her and never let her down - what an unrealisitc goal and boy did I set myself up for a hell of a fall hey ?   I have learnt over the years that just being good enough is the BEST we can possibly do for our kids at all times and sometimes we may not be the right ones to help - this is the most valuable lesson - knowing when to back off.      I suggest you Back Off and give her some space, so what she doesn't run the hoover round or wash up - you try getting any grown up bloke to do it ???  I realise you may be wanting to share the load as she lives there agian.  Remember they are only on loan.    Give her this tel number and website if you are in UK, you could even call them for advice yrself.  They are fab.    Don't be so hard on both of you - you need to just let be and tread water for a while.   Good luck :)|`|sC0NvRzEaa	OMG!  1st- Its LESBIAN  2nd- You should only care about her happiness, her sexual inclination is her choice  3rd- Talk to her about STD's and prevention    Educate your self, there are female condoms and other stuff she can use, so instead of asking q's here, talk to her.    Edit:  How can you have a child if you are not sexually active vaginally??  This question that you asked says that  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|BUz93QWZaa	What's a lesbean?|`|fNWoRd2Haa	If your daughter is a lesbian then there should be nothing you can do. This would be her choice and you should be proud of her for who she is. Gay, straight, bi-sexual- it shouldn't matter to you.     I'm assuming you want her to be happy? Therefore let her be who she needs to be.     With her being 14 however it could just be curiosity or a "phase" or it may not. Either way you need to leave yourself open to whatever she may need to tell you in the future and prepare yourself for what is ahead. It will be a terribly difficult and confusing time for her so now more than ever she will need her mother to support, not judge her.     As for the aids worry for you just educate your daughter on general sexual health issues. I'm sure she's a smart girl- don't doubt her so much.     Good luck with everything.|`|3fYRi1y4aa	Saalllyy....seriously?  I cant believe that you think you cant get Aids by being a lesbian.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Your being ignorant D:  WTH?

You have alot of explaining to do..|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	First of all take a deep breath and get this in perspective.    Your daughter is 14 years old and is obviously becoming sexually aware but do not take it for granted that she will inevitably become a lesbian because of the content you have seen on your computer.    However, I have to say to you that you should be ashamed of invading her privacy.    What you need to realise is that if your daughter does end up being a lesbian that does not mean that she will be promiscuous!!! She is far less likely to contract HIV, let alone AIDS than if she were straight and promiscuous.    She is your daughter and you should love her unconditionally.     Please, for your own sake, do not ruin your relationship by inposing your own, stereotypical views on her life.    If you do and she ends up being gay, then you will lose her.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Les Bean?

1tmX7xbRaa	you should call your local wic office to find out what their income guide lines are. with him being cut down to 3 days a week (if he's the only income) I don't see why you wouldn't be eligible. especially if he gets laid off. check out the link below it should give you some answers|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	I would apply and see what you can get from any kind of govt. help.

You could call your local Health Department and they should be able to tell you if you qualify, based on how much he makes with his reduced schedule.

Fortunately, I am able to walk (I proved those doctors wrong). Life is pretty normal for them unless they are placed in a Special Class. If they can walk, gym will be hard for them no matter what.

CFE4F3eUaa	You got what you got and you just have to live with the fact that you're not perfect. If I had to tell my mom I'd ask her to sit down with me, and I'd just tell her straight in as few words as possible. More than anything else, parents want to know that you care about school, and you take it seriously. Show that you are disappointed and want to do better. Initiating the conversation yourself, and acting as mature and serious about it as you can will definitely help. Avoid all temptation to make excuses, and accept without argument any kind of punishment that is given.    Good luck.

If that's what you see, I would look for help and talk to someone. This could be serious. People who think the way you do are usually the ones who end up with eating disorders. Have your parents or anyone else ever given you a lot of pressure to be thin?  That can be a big cause for people to constantly think they are over weight. If you can talk to your parents, I would. If you don't think they would understand, then you should talk to a school counselor or try to find a help line.|`|jGOPgcw5aa	Yes, this is something to be concerned about.

P0Fjh59Eaa	uh....hold up. 16 yrs ago your sister was 6 yrs old and she's OLDER than you?<br>  <br>  riiiiiight, sure you have a 16 yr old.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Your oldest sister is 22 and you have a 16 year old?  That mathmatically doesnt make any sense.<br>  <br>  This is a once in a life time oppurtunity.  I had the oppurtunity to go to Europe, my dream, when I was 17 and my parents would not allow me for the same reasons you are discussing.<br>  <br>  I still wish I had went.  I will never have the oppurtunity to travel like that ever again.  <br>  <br>  I think that if you even remotly trust your daughter, you should let her go.  If you really are that concerned with her flying by herself, perhaps you could go with her?  Or hire someone to make sure she gets where she needs to be (like hire someone to be at the airport to help her with the lay over, and make sure the person she is going to see will be at the air port when she arrives).|`|qSmCA82Aaa	Well seeing as how a month ago you were worried about going on your first date and talking about seeing him class makes me know that you arenot the mother.<br>  <br>  And then you asked a question as to if your 22 yr old sis could take you to get a peircing without your parents being there so NO I would NOT let you go bc obviously not only are not responsible, your sis doesn't seem to be either or she wouldn't take you somewhere at 15 to get a peircing w.o your parents knowing.<br>  <br>  And if your mom is so uptight on cash that she won't even spend $100 to go to the hospital then how are you affording your plane tickets?|`|KtdlJbrOaa	AS a mother, I too would be nervous, but it would come down to how much I trust my daughter to handle any potential situations that would come up.  Would she be flying as an unaccompanied minor?  If so, I'm sure airline staff would be of great assistance.  I'm thinking of my 14 year old daughter & I would have to say that I know she is mature, and would probably stay in close contact with flight attendants, etc, anyway.  It's such an incredible opportunity - almost too good to miss.  I think I would have to say yes.|`|mylsVujnaa	No. Do you know much about Bangkok? Perhaps you should read up before making your decision. |`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Does she speak the language?  There is a big difference between sending your 16YO daughter into England or Thailand alone.  If she does not speak the language, then she should not be allowed to go.  Perhaps if it is only an hour flight, you could purchase a ticket for your 22YO to fly to Bankok to meet your 16YO when she gets off the plane and also to put her on the plane when it is time to leave.  Also, as others have suggested, contract with the airline agency to keep an eye on her. <br>  <br>  The problem is not her maturity level, it is the criminal activities of others.  If she goes, have her look as unappealing as she is willing to look so she does not look like desirable target for an attack or abduction.<br>  <br>  When discussing this trip, make sure to emphasize your lack of trust of others and that you trust her completely.  You just want to keep her safe.|`|sSrwcZb9aa	Bangkok can be a dangerous place, especially with the sex trade, and more especially for a 16-year-old girl all on her own. My answer would be absolutely not - if it was a layover in some place like Chicago or Denver it wouldn't be such a problem. Plus, being a minor, there might be some snags with her traveling alone, but I'm not exactly sure there.|`|7628ac576ceb56d650a9d1942f1c840baa	You can talk to the airlines and oftentimes they can have someone assist underage passengers to make sure they get to where they are going safely.  I guess it depends on how mature she is, especially in potentially stressful situations, flying to a foreign country and the potential layover and all.  |`|Djnl92vXaa	Hey there.<br>  My family is from England and my eldest sister lives there. And when I was 13 years old my parents flew me from America to England with a stop in 2 different airports. She's sixteen and if she's able to ask for help then I'm sure she'll be perfectly fine!<br>  <br>  I know you're worried that she'll get lost or she'll freak out or something but she won't. If she's not nervous, try not to be. : )|`|MPQCX5yhaa	The only way I would do this is if there was someone to meet her as soon as she got off the plane in Bangkok or i went with her. For safety reasons this would be the only way I would allow this, especially, if she's unfamiliar with Thailand and doesn't know the language. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|QigR4ujHaa	Personally, I would not let a minor anywhere near Bangkok on their own. Too much can go wrong when compared to what is being gained. I would let her choose to do this on her own when she is 18. Inform her as to why you are doing this with some serious facts about the sex trade industry in Bangkok.|`|FHDM8R0Raa	F@ck it! Sorry couldn't help it :-)|`|eOr88RYZaa	if shes responsible id let her go... tell her to thank me

eACZ1Rhjaa	If the mother is unfit you can get a court order preventing her from taking it from the hospital. If she isn't a danger to the baby wait for it to be born then have your attorney file for custody and child support. I don't think most judges would give a father custody if the baby was breast feeding unless the mother was a danger to the baby.<br>  I did see a women lose custody in the hospital the day the baby was born. The ran a test on the infant and he had drugs in his system and went straight from the hospital to foster care.|`|AA10624857	I am assuming you are the baby's father and are not married to the baby's mother.  I think, unless there are some extenuating circumstances such as mother who uses drugs or is a danger to herself or the baby, you will only be able to file for custody of the baby after he has been born.  You will need a lawyer to file for custody, so you could call around to some lawyers' offices and find a few that offer a free initial consultation.  I think in most cases, a baby is considered in the custody of the mother at birth and afterwards.  If, however, you are legally married to the baby's mother I do believe you have inherent joint custody from birth.  Your best bet is to ask a lawyer to be sure.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	haha good luck|`|KtdlJbrOaa	You cannot get physical custody before your son is born, but if you have a legitimate claim, you can start building a case against his mother.  You will need to have valid reasons for taking a child away from his mother - drug &/or alcohol abuse, abuse of prior children, etc.  You should see a family law attorney to help you with this matter.  |`|PLK1p8cUaa	Unfortunately you can't.  It is a lengthy court process.  Talk to an attorney now to see what can be done after the baby is born.  If she does not put your name on the birth certificate then you have to get a court order for DNA testing but that is as well a lengthy process and costs major money, be prepared.  Good luck.|`|WB6TUooVaa	You can't.|`|XNsruA40aa	No court or judge will establish paternal rights over a child that doesn't even exist yet. Well, maybe to you it existed as soon as he was conceived. But in the eyes of the law, not until he is born. Nice try, though.<br>  <br>  Your best shot is to begin building your case, outlining all the reasons that YOU should have custody and NOT the other parent. Evidence and corroborating statements supporting unfit parenthood such as abuse, irresponsibility, and a negligent or dangerous lifestyle are examples. And yet, one would have to wonder why you chose to procreate with such a person anyway.|`|MluvxHtaaa	You can't . but i think it's cruel of you to try ! try to be civil for the baby and have shared custody!!!  both parents deserve to be a part of a child's life.
J6WwpGBGaa	well, im 14 and a girl...but i manage to play at least around 40 something hours a week. I know it sounds like a lot but its not that much compared to how much i was playing it a day during the summer (which was like 18+ hours a day....dont ask how i managed to eat and sleep on that schedule but i did it, and lost 5 pounds along the way)<br>  <br>  This is only because I'm a highish level character that helps my guild do things.<br>  <br>  I run the lower levels through instances and instances have taken me almost 4 hours before and still leave half-way through.<br>  <br>  During the week, I come home do my chores and homework. Play until dinner, do some more chores and then i play until its time for my shower and bed. That averages about 3-4 hours <br>  <br>  On the weekend, when I'm not babysitting or doing homework/chores i play around 5-10 hours a day. Most would say a 14 year old playing 40+ hours a week is bad. However when i first started playing my mom made a deal with me. She said as long as i was level 6 and under i could get 6 hours a week. Sounds sad i know, but then she said once i reached level 7 my game time per week would equal that of my level. once i hit 60 this summer on my main character she said that my next highest character under 60 would be my game limit. my next highest character is a level 34. So I am now allowed 34 hours game time. It gives my mom a chance to moniter my play time, plus it can give her an idea of how i'm playing and what exactly im doing.<br>  <br>  Then with the new expansion pack coming on November 10 (can't wait...its been pre-ordered since july) she's going to allow me to play a little high than my 34 hour limit because she knows i cant wait (i've been playing with the test realm since it went live.)<br>  <br>  So basically, I would do like my mom did with me if i was you. <br>  I would ask him how involved he is with his guild. Then ask him the level of his highest character (because God knows he has more than one), and say that character's level sets his game time. Then set a level to which his character's level is obsolete in determining how much time is spent playing. My level 60 is mainly obsolete because i dont even play on it too much, if i need a level, I log onto a friend's account and use their level 70. And by the way, the new expansion pack brings a new level cap at 80, so this may be tricky to configure if you dont talk to your son.<br>  <br>  my mom and i have almost nightly conversations before i sign off, when im in a battle ground. While I'm playing, I explain my new stuff to her and what level i got it to give her a sense of what level i am. She only checks every 4th of the month, and that is my play time per week for the next month so it doesnt change every week.<br>  <br>  If you dont understand you can ask me in like an email or something...<br>  oh and if you are wondering, im home sick along with a sprained ankle =(<br>  <br>  it sucks because tuesdays are also maitnance days...no playing until 1 my time|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Well....after all of his homework and chores are done AND he's played outside and has gotten some fresh air and exercise then I'd say an hour or two a day tops. I KNOW some quests take awhile (my hubby used to play) but he'll just have to budget his time better while playing. |`|w0eRRsoVaa	I've always run under the assumption that kids shouldn't play video games for more than an hour or two.  I'd rather my kid run the streets, climb trees, play sports, etc. than sit around and play a video game.  I'm also 24 lol, so I don't know if that makes a difference what I've said.  If we played, it was after we got home from school up until mom got home from work so about 2 hours and that was on non-afterschool sport days.|`|LXc9tGJVaa	Well, I'd say maybe an hour to an hour and a half per day, maybe a little more on weekends. If he gets upset when you tell him to turn it off, make him feel like it's a privelage to play it by introducing a small list of chores he must do before playing, and make sure his homework is done and it's not too close to bedtime. I'm 20 years old and I have a favorite video game I like to play, but even I make sure all the things around my apartment are done before I start (like dishes, mopping, cleaning, etc), because I know I'll have a problem dragging myself away to do them if I start playing a game before they're done. Good luck, I hope this helps!|`|AA11795652	My 32-year-old kid who I call "husband" also plays WOW.  We have two kids now and he doesn't get to play it as much at home but he gets to play at work.  He's a police department dispatcher and got permission from his chief to install WOW on the computers there.  My husband used to play about 20 hours a week (at least) before baby #2.  If I had a 12-year-old, I would limit it to 1 hour a day during the weekdays and maybe 2 hours on Saturday's and Sunday's.  Use WOW as a bargaining tool too!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Personally, I wouldn't let my 12 year old play online games like that, but that's just me.  All I hear about is how "addictive" World of Warcraft is.  I'd rather my 12 year old be spending his free time doing something more productive and healthy.<br>  <br>  If you feel comfortable letting him play the game, then you also need to choose an amount of time that you are comfortable with.  Its all up to you.  If you feel like 30 minutes a day is enough, then so be it.  If you feel like an hour a day is enough, then there ya go.  Its all up to you.|`|410fcc41bc347bf1fb885c265d6c25ebaa	i'm 17 i think you shouldn't focus on how long he's on focus on his grades if he listens to you and if he does something wrong and knows better then just take it away for a day. my bf plays it 24/7 it's harmless.|`|0e4ec90e978769f9222aded1018a21f5aa	I'm 24 and my husband is 23 and we both play. We've been playing for just over 2 years and in the beginning my husband and I were very addicted to it. <br>  <br>  I was between jobs when I started playing and I got so addicted that I would play ALL day long. I would probably play like 12 or more hours a day. My husband was the same way.<br>  <br>  Now I usually just play for a few hours on the weekend.<br>  <br>  I would suggest only letting him play for an hour or hour and a half a day. That way he really can't get too addicted. Like other posters said though, some features of the game can take 4 or more hours, but he could always reserve that for weekends.|`|PPoCaJEEaa	After he has his homework and chores done I think he should be able to play if he wants. I'd limit him to an hour or two a day though, that game is soooo easy to get adicted to. Make sure he doesn't start revolving his life around the game.<br>  |`|ZyBeiFPbaa	hmm after he does his homework and chores i guess then he can play whenever. i play alot as well. and my b/f currently unemployed plays like all day long. its an addicting game lol. but if hes a high level char. and raids id say bout 4 hours then cuz it takes a while to get ready and stuff|`|s7eG0LtCaa	never

My son one day had a bunch of little red spots on his whole body and all he had on was a onesie and the day was not hot. So I took off his clothes and left his diaper on to cool him off. I went to numerous doctors' and they all told me it was heat rash and totally normal. So for three months while they were telling me he did not have baby eczema he was scratching and scabing up his face and legs! I was mad to finally find out that my baby had baby eczema and it has been a battle ever since. My son is now 6 months old and the steroid ointment has helped some, though I just got a scare because the derm. prescribed another medication b/c he was worried about the long exposure effects of the steroid oinment on my son and he broke out into hives. Making him really itchy and miserable. With the steroid ointment it has worked so far as to where his eczema is only appearing every two days. I only put him in onsies b/c his skin is so sensitive and   changed to all natural laundry detergent. Good luck finding out what it is and pray it is not baby eczema.

8WbfmK5daa	Sorry don't like Jasper as a girls name. Really cute for a boy though.<br>  <br>  I don't think ELsie and Alfie are too similar for siblings they are cute together.<br>  <br>  I like Matilda and Isla the best for the girls name.<br>   <br>  If your just wanting one then Isla would be my fav :)|`|AA11138222	I gave it a few minutes and I still don't like it for a girl OR a boy. In my opinion it's a good name for a cat.<br>  <br>  But...my opinion really doesn't matter, it's what you like that counts!|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Jasper is definitely a boys name. It doesn't sound feminine at all.<br>  Yes. Elsie and Alfie sound very similar. <br>  I like Heidi Rose for a girl. :-)|`|bRAmXcowaa	I like it, for a boy or a girl, but think i would change it slightly for a girl (maybe Jazper)<br>  <br>  Elsie and Alfie are similar but I think you could get away with it, you could shorten Elsie to elle as a nickname for family and friends.<br>  <br>  Id prefer Matilda from the names you gave, which you could shorten to Tilly or Matty (either way very cute)|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	I absolutely LOVE the name Jasper (my spoiled dwarf bunny's name is Jasper) but more for a boy then a girl but now that I'm reading this and thinking, its actually cute for a girl too..:o)<br>  <br>  I love the name Matilda, Rose as a middle name and Heidi (my cats name)<br>  Yes I like Elsie and not so much for Alfie :o(|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I am glad your not my mother<br>  <br>  Jasper is an awful name for a girl<br>  It's a boys name<br>  <br>  Elsie is okay<br>  Alfie is awful, may cute for a cate<br>  <br>  Matilda, I love, Tillie for short<br>  Matilda Rose or Rose Matilda would be my choice for a girl|`|3ec2dc9c564affe4311fe2b01585ad71aa	Jasper is only suit for a boy in my opinion. <br>  <br>  Elsie and Alfie, yeah those are a bit similiar<br>  <br>  My favorites are Isla and Matilda =]|`|igvUbqkyaa	I really dislike Jasper for a boy but it is a bit cuter for a girl, but I still wouldn't use it personally! As for the other names, I don't like Elsie and Alfie and they just kind of sound weird for full names.<br>  <br>  I love Matilda, Rose, and Catherine (nickname Caty if you want)!!!<br>  <br>  If you go with Catherine - that would be my favorite, but if not, I would go with Matilda - possibly Matilda Rose!|`|WdRLgvw6aa	I'm not a fan of Jasper for a girl's name.  I appreciate it for being quirky but it sounds neither pretty nor smart.<br>  <br>  Elsie and Alfie are a little similar - but I think that just makes them even cuter as sibling names.<br>  <br>  I've always been partial to the name Heidi so the last question is a no-brainer for me.  That name has always seemed so happy and outgoing to me and I love the way it looks written out.|`|TrBoPj92aa	sorry but i think jasper sounds like a soft masculine name, name your son it =) <br>  <br>  elsie  + alfie aren't too similar they are really adorable and cute =)<br>  <br>  1) Heidi<br>  2) Rose<br>  3) Caty<br>  4) Isla<br>  5) Matilda<br>  6) Lois<br>  <br>  Rose is a gorgeous middle name !<br>  Heidi Rose<br>  Matilda Rose<br>  Isla Rose<br>  Caty Rose<br>  Lois Rose <br>  are all gorgeous <br>  <br>  xox|`|d6e11chxaa	I think Jasper and Alfie are great twin boys. Jasper is a thousand percent a boy's name, please don't use it on a girl! I hate boy names on girls, so I doubt I'll change my mind on it. I think Isla, then Matilda, are my favorites out of your list.|`|6Swq0iEPaa	Jasper is definitely a boy name, sorry... I love Elsie and Alfie together, but only if it's Alfred. He needs a strong name as he grows, :). Love Heidi and Rose out of that bunch. Good luck with twins, especially boys! Whew!|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I don't like Jasper at all. It sounds like a dopey cowboy to me, I dunno why. I don't care for Elsie or Alfie either. <br>  <br>  I do love Isla, it's gorgeous! 2nd - I love Caty.|`|9c664e07f8c2007897e3697258c8ca68aa	I don't like Jasper as a girl's name|`|9OKG0a5Baa	jasper is a great name for a boy but awful for a girl.  definately give it to one of your twins.<br>  alfie and elsie are rather similar but oddly enough they also go very well.<br>  <br>  from the others i dont like isla or caty (is this meant to be pronouced katie?).  but lois and heidi are cute.  rose is lovely but very popular.  matilda is great.<br>  <br>  good luck and congratulations|`|5QtseYWuaa	Um im not sure I like Jasper but maybe not for a little girl who someday will be an adult(I don't think it sounds mature or professional). I think I would like it better for a boy. <br>  <br>  For Elsie and Alfie i think they sound to much the same.<br>  <br>  Between ur last names I would pick Caty its just to cute and sweet sounding I love it.|`|kvmWDuOJaa	Congrats :3<br>  I'd never heard of Jasper as a girls name either, but I actually really like it. It would suit both a girl or a boy. I love it to be honest.<br>  <br>  I like the names Elsie and Alfie, although they are a bit similar, yeah. I prefer Elsie (:<br>  <br>  My favourite of those names is Isla- so, so pretty!<br>  <br>  If I helped, please consider voting for me? It would mean an awful lot:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a>|`|3Jqn7a3Vaa	I think Jasper would work for either a boy or girl, though my daughters (who are 9 and 7) definitely think it sounds more like a girl's name.  <br>  <br>  We also like Rose and Caty the best from your list of other girls names.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HsDGrRMtaa	jasper is a lovely name and i think i do kind of prefer it for a boy rather that a girl.<br>  i do think elsie and alfie are slightly too similar<br>  and last i love the name heidi<br>  good luck with the birth btw!!|`|IEZoHcysaa	I like Jasper for a boy but not a girl.<br>  <br>  I think Elsie and Alfie are to similar for siblings-(I think everyone will get confused)<br>  <br>  I like Caty.<br>  <br>  Have fun with the twins.<br>  <br>  I like Jasper and John, or Jasper and Hunter|`|CAAglUKzaa	Honestly.<br>  I love the name Jasper.<br>  Very cute for a gal and a boy's name!<br>  I would recomend you to name one of your boy's this.<br>  But i'm not you, and they are your babies!|`|YrjkOttiaa	Jasper just makes me think of Jasper Carrott!! hahahahaha Don't Do It!!  Also, I think Elsie and Alfie need to be avoided - its 2009 not 1909!!|`|TeZnrFLIaa	In my opinion I dont like the name for a girl or a boy! I have only ever known dogs with that name but as someone else said its your opinion that counts!!|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I like Jasper for a boy, not a girl.<br>  <br>  Don't like either Elsie or Alfie at all.<br>  <br>  Rose and Isla are nice.|`|hk5f8yxVaa	It is a gem stone, and is quite nice for a girl. I'd never call a boy Jasper.|`|9ip0dCL5aa	Interesting!

Pero creo que la responsabilidad no es sólo de nosotros los hombres, también nuestras queridas ni?as pueden llevar uno, dos o tres condones…no es malo, no se dejen llevar por lo que lleguasen a pensar: - “Uy…esta ya viene preparada” “Es bien p%&&a, traía condones” - No, es mejor llevarlos que a quedarse con ganas o bien hacerlo sin protección, y después no poder dormir.<br>  <br>  Algo que apoyo es el uso de la píldora de emergencia, pero…?Qué es la píldora de emergencia?<br>  <br>  <br>  La píldora de emergencia, también es conocida como “la píldora del día siguiente”, es un método anticonceptivo de emergencia para usarse después de una relación sexual sin protección. Está compuesta de las mismas hormonas de las píldoras anticonceptivas (estrógeno y progestina), pero en mayores dosis. <br>  <br>  ?Cómo funciona? Interviene antes de que se efectúe el embarazo, dependiendo del día del ciclo menstrual: <br>  <br>  Si la relación sexual es antes de la ovulación, la píldora impide que el óvulo sea liberado del ovario, demorando la ovulación. <br>  Si la relación sexual es durante o después de la ovulación, la píldora evita que el espermatozoide fecunde al óvulo. <br>  ?Es abortiva? No es un método abortivo, pues no tiene la capacidad de interrumpir un embarazo. La píldora sólo actúa cuando el óvulo aún no ha sido fecundado.<br>  <br>  ?En qué casos debe tomarse? Se recomienda tomar en tres casos: si tuviste relaciones sexuales sin protección, si falló o se rompió tu método anticonceptivo de barrera (condón o diafragma), o si hubo una violación. Debes llamar a tu ginecólogo en cuanto hayas tenido relaciones sexuales sin protección, pues cuanto antes tomes las píldoras de emergencia, mayores serán las probabilidades de prevenir un embarazo.<br>  <br>  ?Cuánta eficacia tiene?Cuando es utilizada antes de las 72 horas posteriores a la relación sexual sin protección, se tiene un 98% de seguridad de no quedar embarazada. La primera dosis se toma dentro de las primeras 72 horas, y la segunda se toma en las siguientes 12 horas. Sin embargo, la píldora no resulta eficaz si ya estás embarazada pues el óvulo fecundado ya se implantó en el útero, si tuviste relaciones sexuales sin protección hace más de 72 horas, si vomitas o tienes diarrea dos horas después de tomarla, si dejaste que pasara demasiado tiempo entre ambas dosis, o si olvidaste tomar la segunda dosis.<br>  <br>  ?Puede tomarla cualquier persona? únicamente tu ginecólogo puede determinar si es segura en tu caso. No la puedes tomar si has tenido una hemorragia vaginal sin causa aparente, coágulos de sangre, o si eres alérgica a cualquiera de sus componentes.<br>  <br>  ? Cuáles son sus efectos secundarios? Los efectos secundarios normalmente duran 24 horas y pueden ser: mareos, náuseas, vómitos, dolor de cabeza, retención de líquidos y sensibilidad en los senos. Es importante que tu médico te dé un antiemético para evitar que elimines la píldora. Es indispensable que recurras a tu ginecólogo si tienes síntomas como: dolor, enrojecimiento o inflamación en las piernas, extremidades adormecidas, dolores severos en el abdomen, problemas para respirar, visión borrosa o pérdida de la visión, debilidad, aturdimiento, sangrado irregular, o ausencia de menstruación después de 21 días de tomar la píldora.<br>  <br>  <br>  No debes usar la píldora de emergencia como un método anticonceptivo usual (osea que lo uses diario o cada que la riegues), ya que puedes provocar que tu chava tenga trastornos hormonales.<br>  <br>  Llevala al medico , en vez de que se tome ese tremendo coctel de hormonas , que mejor le den anticonceptivos de acuerdo al que su cuerpo necesite.<br>  <br>  Saludos _=)|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Si, entre más jóvenes sean, más probabilidades tienen de procrear, de que ella quede embarazada.

enBwE8fraa	Yo le pregunte al pediatra de mi bebe, el le dio acetaminofen o tylenol para infantes, eso lo puedes comprar en la farmacia, viene con gotero y tu le das segun el peso de tu bebe, funciona y les quita el dolor, tambien le doy oragel que es una pasta que se le pone en las encias, y sus juguetes de gelly filled, que son para los dientes se los pongo en el freezer y cuando los agarra se calma, muchas personas me dijeron que darle una cebollita funcionaba yo lo hize pero mi bebe no lo quizo.

Dos gotitas de Nene Dent en tu dedo super limpio o una gasita y con eso frotas suavemente la encia.... y si se pone muy mal ni modo Panadol, es mas eso sobre todo en caso de fiebre (mi bebe no hizo fiebre pero tengo entendido que otros bebitos si). Saludos.|`|ocdO7r01aa	a mi pek le puse unas gotas que se llaman neneden no se las pongas en gel porque no les gusta, mejor en liquido, la manera de usarse es ponerte cierta cantidad en tus manos limpias, y le frotas la encia a tu bebe, también puedes usas las cebollitas de cambray, se la das para que la muerda este es un remedio de las abuelitas. <br>  el tiempo de duración de los dientes varia de persona a persona no te desesperes si apenas le comenzaron a salir los dientes es importante que tengas paciencia ya que los que les duelen mas son los colmillos y las muelas. suerte!!!!|`|1LiWGzT1aa	miel de borac<br>   y el tiempo varia en cada ni?o,,<br>  en mi bebe tardo 1mes en salirle el primer dientico|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Usar mordederas es lo mas adecuado =)|`|AzLLc1ORaa	el tiempo es variable<br>  algunos bebes tardan mucho otros no tanto<br>  a veces estan muy molestos antes de que empiece a asomar otras veces no es así<br>  los "mordillos" que contienen un líquido y se congelan pueden aliviarlos<br>  pregunta al pediatra si se puede poner xilocaína o algo así que calma un poco también<br>  pero pronto van pasando el dolorcito no te preocupes<br>  mucha suerte y felicidades

2lb74KVGaa	Nada más que ponerla al pecho cuando la bebé te lo pida. A una le parece que le falta leche porque los senos ya no están hinchados ni goteando, pero no es así porque son una perfecta máquina que cuando regulariza la lactancia, muchas veces ya no se hinchan ni gotean y sale perfectamente la lechita mientras el bebé está mamando. A veces pasa que la separación entre madre y bebé, los malos consejos de pediatras sobre tomas de 10 minutos y con horario, la falta de tomas nocturnas sabotean la leche materna, sin embargo puedes seguir haciéndolo porque es algo muy natural y es muy raro que una mujer no tenga leche, tanto que sería una aberración de la naturaleza. Y no necesitas ningún menjurge, solo alimentarte sanito, cereales, frutas, vegetales, carne, pescado, leche, todo balanceado.|`|75a575e88be26b27d604120e1c05b1dbaa	dejalo q siga mamando q eso estimula q la produccion de leche,me lo dijo mi pediatra.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Ve con el pediatra, seguro el cambia por una fórmula que satisfaga más a tu bebé. Suerte =)|`|5639748204bcfb8b89478f185e2cea27aa	hola tambien tengo una bebe de mes y medio y me sucedio lo mismo que a ti. Lo mejor para que la leche continue bajando es poner a tu peque lo mas que puedas para que chupe , es lo que me dijo el medico ya que aunque hay mil cosas que dicen pueden ayudarte a que la leche no se corte segun mi ginecologo no es asi y solo la succion del bebe hace que la leche baje. Se las ganas que tienes de darle el pecho a tu bebe ya que es una sensacion y un vhinculo muy bonito entre la mama y el bebe, pero la cantidad de leche que nos baje eso depende de cada mujer y con cuanta frecuencia le des el pecho a tu peque?a. En mi caso tambien estoy alternandole el pecho con leche artificial, pero de todos modos siempre antes del bibe le ofrezco el pecho para ver si hay suerte porque si se acostumbran al bibe ,... amiga lo siento pero ya no te agarrara el pecho. Yo le doy la leche Hero 1 para recien nacidos y toma 150 ml cada cuatro horas aproximadamente. Te lo comento como referencia... y con esta cantidad queda satisfecha aunque el pediatra me dijo que ya puede tomar hasta 180 ml cada cinco horas si los demanda o al contrario darle menos cantidad cada menos tiempo. Eso es segun como alimentes a tu peque cada cuanto tiempo te lo pida.<br>  Te dejo un saludo y suerte  y felicidades por la bebita|`|gnCXtuhMaa	Lo único que tienes que hacer, es aumentar el número de veces que das de mamar a tu hijo y dejarlo que mame todo el tiempo que sea necesario en cada pecho, hasta que estén bien vacíos. A los dos o tres días de hacer esto aumentará tu producción de leche. Mantén una dieta sana y equilibrada, y bebe toda el agua que necesites pero no bebas cerveza, pues tiene alcohol que pasaría a tu leche y al ni?o. Procura estar lo más tranquila y relajada posible y consíguete el apoyo de tu pareja, familia y amigos. no le des ningún biberón pues no lo necesita! si tienes dudas habla con tu pediatra.|`|HeZ893Boaa	mi consejo es que tomes mucho liquido todo el que puedas como jugos, agua, sopas y no tomes nada raro no es necesario solo con liquidos produciras mas leche y con si pones la bebe a mamar esto activa el proceso de produccion de leche. mi bebe tiene 20 meses y aun lo amamanto como el primer dia. tamien puedes complementarle con leche formula porque si ella no toma la suficiente leche materna se va a desnutrir.<br>  <br>  Suerte y feliz ano|`|Tt9Q5HQIaa	Para tener más leche sólo hay que ponerse al bebé al pecho con mucha frecuencia.<br>  Sé de mujeres que han dejado la lactancia por aburrimiento y por falta de paciencia por no ponerse al ni?o en el pecho muy frecuentemente,pero la succión es lo que hace que el pecho produzca leche en abundancia.<br>  También hay que beber mucho líquido:agua,zumos....<br>  Yo,por mi parte,me bebo de vez en cuando una cerveza,porque dicen que hace que te suba más la leche,pero no sé si será verdad.<br>  Prueba poniendote a tu ni?a al pecho cada 3 horas justas,así me lo dijo la pediatra de la mía y me ha ido estupendamente!|`|UDEPOizSaa	Lo más importante, es que tú estés convencida de darle el pecho, tú tranquilidad y tú fe es fundamental.<br>  Has de tomar mucho líquido mientras das el pecho y antes de hacerlo. Tomar levadura de cerveza, germen de trigo y polen, son grandes aliados. También beber horchata. Sin duda alguna los lacteos, has de proteger tus huesos.<br>  Busca un lugar tranquilo donde tú bebé y tú, esteis relajados y mejora sus digestiones bebiendo tú, infusiones de comino y anís estrellado.<br>  Verás que todo irá bien.<br>  Felicidades por tu maternidad y por tú lactancia.<br>  ELISHEBA|`|2I6X80p2aa	La solucion que me dio la comadrona a mi es esta y funciona te explico: La produccion de leche va en funcion de la succion que realize tu bebe, es decir cuanto mas chupe tu hija mas leche produciras tú. Prueba a darle el pecho cada 2 horas durante un par de dias dejando la leche de formula, tu no te quedas sin leche es tu beba que necesita mas y para tener la cantidad que ella necesita debe de chupar mas y asi funciona la cosa. Si por el contrario sigues con la leche de formula al dejar de succionar ella tambien produciras menos ... No te desanimes pruebalo no pierdes nada se que se hace pesado pero si de verdad quieres darle el pecho a tu hija puedes hacerlo.Mucha suerte!|`|m3vM7UoUaa	Amiga:<br>  <br>  La leche no se va a ningun lado, no se seca de la noche a la manana, lo que puede estar sucediendo es que tu bebe tiene un pico o crisis de crecimiento y algunos dias quieren solo mamar y mamar, eso no significa que te estes quedando sin leche, tu bebe le esta dando el mensaje a tu cuerpo de que ya paso a otra etapa y de que necesita mas leche, la succion de tu hijo(a) es lo unico que hara que tu cuerpo produzca la leche que el o ella necesitan, ni mas ni menos.<br>  <br>  <br>  El introducir leche industrializada y ponerle horarios y limites al dar de mamar a tu bebe es el camino seguro a que fracase tu lactancia materna que hasta hace un dia era exclusiva.

eqIGmWTHaa	Felicidades por tu bebe, se ve que estas muy anciosa jijiji aun falta para que coma, y no se si seran tantos alimentos como para un recetario pero te digo lo que le doy a mi bebe TODO POR INDICACION DEL PEDIATRA.<br>  Antes de los 4 meses solo tomaba leche, cada 3 horas mas o menos, por las noches no le daba alimento, entre las 23:30 y 6:00 am, solo lo console con chupon, algunos no lo consideran bueno, pero fue muy util ya que dormia toda la noche sin despertar a la semana de vida.<br>  A los 4 meses comenze con jugos naturales de fruta, unos 30mL diarios como a las 10am, jugo de pera o manzana, mitad jugo y mitad agua hervida fria. Despues cada mes le aumente 15mL de jugo.<br>  A los 5 meses siguio con los mismos jugos, pero ademas empezo a comer compotas de fruta tambien de pera o manzana o platano, en las tardes.<br>  A los 6 meses comenzo a almorzar, carne de vacuno o pechuga de pollo o pavo (cantidad de referencia una caja de fosforos), acompa?ado con papas, zapallo, zanahoria, acelga, espinaca.<br>  Tenia 2 menu de compota, papa-zanahoria-zapallo, papa-acelga-espinaca, siempre variando entre carne, pollo. Todo hervido y bien molido, como compota. La cantidad era media taza.<br>  Entonces su horario a los 6 meses era, a las 9:00 leche, 11:00 jugo (durazno, uva, zanahoria, ciruela), 14:00 almuerzo + compota de fruta (pera, manzana o platano), 17:30 leche, 22:00 leche.<br>  Las cantidades depende de lo que te recomiende el pediatra, por su peso, estatura, meses. Un bebe a pesar de comer alimentos, siempre debe tomar como minimo 500mL diarios de leche.<br>  A los 7 meses comia lo mismo pero ademas cenaba. Entonces tuve que agregar una comida, pero no disminuir la cantidad de leche, por lo que se alimentaba mas seguido.<br>  9:00 leche, 10:30 jugo, 12:30 almuerzo + compota de fruta, 16:00 leche, 19:30 comida,  22:00 leche.<br>  A los 8 meses incorpore pescado en la misma cantidad que la carne, no mas de 1 vez por semana. y agrege 1 compota de fruta en la comida de las 19:30 tambien.<br>  A los 8 meses y medio le di porotos, al hervirlos bien, se puede sacar muy facil el cuero, para que no produzca gases, no mas de 5 porotitos a la comida, para probar la primera vez, llentejas, os jugos de todas las frutas posibles, menos frutilla.<br>  Ahora mi hijo tiene 9 meses y anda muy bien, cuidado que los meses de incorporacion de los alimentos y variedades es diferente en cada pais. EL pediatra te tiene que ir indicando paso a paso que incorporas en su alimentacion, los horarios dependen de tus costumbres, a cada cual le puede convenir un horario.<br>  Mucha suerte con tu bebe y nada de chocolates, galletas!!!|`|yuejuLjOaa	uuff de aqui a que coma ya tienes 2 recetarios no nada mas uno jeje <br>  ;-) amiga a decir verdad, no son muchos los alimentos que pueden comer, es un proceso y siempre se empieza con cereal libre de gluten, papillas de verduras y frutas, las carnes vienen hasta despues de los 8 meses; en cuanto a tiempos, horarios y cantidades; no existe un momento estandar para introducirle a los solidos, el pediatra te lo indicara, es generalmente en algun momento entre los 4 y 6 meses; empezaras con 2 cucharadas de papilla o cereal por la ma?ana y 2 por la tarde-noche; los horarios varian en cada bebe; es de acuerdo a sus necesidades, debe seguir tomando leche hasta por lo menos despues del a?o.<br>  Mi pagina favorita en www.espanol.babycenter.com ahi hay informacion y tenemos unos foros buenisimos, puedes compartir inquietudes y todo lo que desees. espero verte por alla.<br>  Saludos.|`|cM1RmI42aa	bueno esta muy peque?o ahora pero desde los 3 meses puedes comenzar a darle papillas <br>  a esta etapa se le llama periodo de ablantacion<br>  se comiensa con jugos menos de citricos esos se les dan hasta el a?o, se continua con papillas de frutas y verduras una ala vez xejemplo papilla de manzana y ya nada mas, para despues continuar mezclando 2 frutas o 2 verduas llegando a los 6 meses se comiensa con pastas cereales y pollo.<br>  <br>  hay muchas pagina no las recuerdo pero pon en el buscador recetas para bebes de x meses y te sale, puedes buscar una tabla donde te marca segun la edd dl bb que es lo que se le puede dar.<br>  los horarios<br>  despertando su biberon<br>  un desyuno ligero <br>  almuerzo<br>  comida<br>  clacion( fruta)<br>  merienda <br>  biberon<br>  debes intercalar su leche pues apesar de que ya comen aun necesitan de ella|`|8772610b9c29b57a40662e6c7a369ddfaa	Hola, te dejo un link para que veas mas o menos que alimentos son separados por meses:<br>  <a href="http://www.planetamama.com.ar/view_e_recetas.php?id_etapa=35" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetamama.com.ar/view_e_rec...</a><br>  <br>  Ademas, te cuento, no esperes que tu bb coma un monton, primero seguramente lo que va a hacer, a menos que sea un bb glotón jeje es empujar la comida para afuera cuando se la das. Si come no comera mucho más que dos cucharadas soperas, y no debes preocuparte porque las primeras comidas son como de practica ;)<br>  Lo que en general (al menos en Argentina) hacen los pediatras, es esperar hasta los 6 meses para reemplazarle una sola toma en el dia, que suele ser al mediodia, por una comida. Empiezan casi siempre con pure de calabaza con una gotita apenas de aceite neutro, sin sal ni azucar, o compota de una manzana roja hecha puré. A medida que pasen los meses se a?aden nuevos alimentos, pero siempre hasta el a?o no se deben a?adir cosas con azucar a?adida, fritos, salsas pesadas, manteca, bananas, citricos, picantes, chocolate, frutillas, kiwis, choclo en grano...hay varias cosas, por diferentes motivos, por alergias, constipacion o simplemente (como en el caso del choclo), que pueda atragantarse.

Sostenga al bebé<br>  en una posición sentada. Abrace al bebé y provea contacto ojo<br>  a ojo. No apresure el proceso de alimentación. Los bebés<br>  requieren al menos veinte minutos por alimentación. Pare 2 a<br>  3 veces durante la alimentación para hacer que el bebé eructe.<br>  De Leche Materna o Fórmula A Sólidos<br>  La Academia Americana de Pediatras sugiere que la leche<br>  materna o fórmula infantil preparada fortificada con hierro es la<br>  úNICA comida para alimentar a bebés menores a 4 a 6 meses.<br>  Evite servir leche regular de vaca antes de 1 a?o. Un pediatra<br>  puede aconsejar sobre el mejor momento para comenzar con<br>  sólidos. Introducir semi sólidos antes de que esté desarrollado y<br>  psicológicamente listo es inapropiado. No hay prueba de que<br>  una introducción temprana de sólidos ayude al bebé a dormir<br>  mejor. No sirva cereal mezclado con fórmula o leche materna<br>  de una botella. Servir cereal en una botella puede impedir la<br>  habilidad del bebé de comer de una cuchara y puede causar<br>  asfixia. Debido a que la alimentación por botella es más rápida<br>  que la alimentación con cuchara, los bebés pueden no tener la<br>  sensación de “estar lleno” hasta que hayan comido mucho cereal.<br>  Darles mucho cereal y no suficiente fórmula o leche materna<br>  lleva a una ingesta nutricional baja. Use jugo en cantidades<br>  reducidas debido a su alto contenido de azúcar.<br>  Listo Para Alimentos Semi Sólidos:<br>  ?Qué Significa Esto?<br>  Alrededor de los 5 a 6 meses, el sistema digestivo del bebé<br>  puede comenzar a digerir carbohidratos y proteínas complejas.<br>  Al mismo tiempo, las reservas de hierro de nacimiento han<br>  desaparecido. Es tiempo de empezar la introducción de alimentos<br>  semi sólidos tales como cereales enriquecidos con hierro, y frutas y verduras en forma de puré. Para los 6 a 7 meses, los<br>  ri?ones del bebé están suficientemente desarrollados para manejar<br>  los desperdicios que contienen nitrógeno procedentes de la<br>  adición de productos de carne altos en proteína. Introduzca alimentos<br>  semi sólidos lentamente ofreciendo unas pocas<br>  cucharadas de bebé 1 o 2 veces diariamente. El cereal fortificado<br>  con hierro usualmente viene al principio. Empiece con cereales<br>  de arroz o cebada debido a que son los menos propensos a<br>  causar alergias. Diluya los cereales con fórmula, leche materna,<br>  o agua. Siga los cereales con verduras, fruta, y luego carne.<br>  Inicialmente ofrezca alimentos individuales en lugar de mezclas<br>  para que la fuente de alergias o sensibilidades puedan ser fácilmente<br>  identificadas si llegan a ocurrir. Es mejor ofrecer un<br>  nuevo alimento por 3 a 5 días para descartar una posible alergia.<br>  <br>  * 0-4 meses, LECHE, ya se a leche materna cada vez que quiera comer,<br>            formula es variable, segun el pediatra algunas veces segun la formula hay formulas que vienes por etapas de 0 a 6 mese, luego de 6 a 12 meses, luego de 1 a?o a 3 a?os..: <br>    <br>   0-1 mes puede ser de 6 a 8 porciones diarias , cada 2  horas aprox, de 2 a 5 onzas,<br>  1-2 meses  de 5 a 7 porciones diarias de 3 a 6 onzas <br>  2-3 meses  de 4 a 7 porciones diarias de 4 a 7 onzas <br>  3-4 meses de 4 a 6 porciones diarias de 6 a 8 onzas <br>  <br>  *4-6 meses<br>  4-6 meses leche materna  cada vez que quiera comer<br>  FORMULA  4-5 meses:  de 4 a 6 porciones diarias de 6 a 8 onzas <br>                    5-6 meses  de 4 a 6 porciones diarias de 6 a 8 onzas con  1 o 2 cucharadas de cereal para bebes fortificado con hierro... en 2 de las 4 o 6 porciones diarias<br>    te mando una direccion  abajito de apoyo <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oregondairycouncil.org/resources/free_downloads/downloads/How_To_Feed_Baby-Spanish.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oregondairycouncil.org/resour...</a>

Tan solo estarán dos cuerpos desnudos tocándose, explorándose y descubriendo sensaciones gratas. Si el enamoramieno está presente, el asunto se pone mejor.

Si es con tu pareja será más fácil y grato; si no, no tienes porqué apresurarte, mejor asegúrate con protección. Puedes esperarte a hacerlo con la persona adecuada, no te desesperes, no quieras demostrarte tu virilidad teniendo sexo urgentemente. El temor tambien puede ser por contraer alguna enfermedad, pero siempre hazlo con protección y olvídate de ello. A veces sale la oportunidad por si sola, cuando menos te la esperas.

kiAQi91laa	No, it's definitely not a bad thing.   Most expectant mothers stop having morning sickness symptoms towards the end of the their first trimester.  You're fortunate that the symptoms ended earlier than most.  Unless you have any other symptoms such as sharp abdominal pains or bright bleeding...you should make sure to keep your regular scheduled appointments with your doctor.  <br>  <br>  If this is still bothering you and you can't wait until your next doctor's visit then call the doctor's office and ask the nurse on duty.
2013075b963c70173a3dc732a3f43ecfaa	Outside the body, sperm die off very quickly. The only place they survive outside of the man is inside a woman. If the mature sperm is not "released" by the man, they generally start to die off in a weeks time-but there is always new sperm maturing to fill in the space left by the old ones. They can live for up to 5 days in the female reproductive tract (though most die much more quickly).

I saw a woman at the park last summer give a child that had to be at least 4 and probably older a drink from the breast to comfort him after he scraped his knee. Personally, I didn't like my kid seeing that. Don't misunderstand, nursing is perfectly natural, and I have no problem with a mother doing it as long as she is discreet. This woman just let it all hang out. It was really creepy!|`|LWXRVO5Haa	"Breastfeeding beyond the first year offers considerable benefits to both mother and child, and should continue as long as mutually desired." They also note that "If the child is younger than two years of age, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned." (AAFP 2001) <br>  <br>  "Breastfeeding should be continued for at least the first year of life and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child... Increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and the mother... There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer." (AAP 2005) <br>  <br>  A US Surgeon General has stated that it is a lucky baby who continues to nurse until age two. (Novello 1990)<br>  <br>  <br>  The World Health Organization emphasizes the importance of nursing up to two years of age or beyond (WHO 1992, WHO 2002). <br>  <br>  <br>  Scientific research by Katherine A.

One particular time he was sick ( he was just over 2 yo) I took him to the doctor and the doctor asked what I was giving him to eat/drink . I told him about the jello and gatorade and things like that that I was offering him, then mentioned that the majority of his calories for the last 6-8 days had been breastmilk.

ZZzQLjaKaa	My parents were thrilled beyond belief....but we were not as young as you guys. I think it is probably too late too ponder their concerns, and time to blurt it out over a nice dinner. Present them with bibs that say I love Grandma, Grandpa etc, or a framed ultra sound picture. Whatever their misgivings may be, you are married, you are pregnant, and the little one is on the way! I am sure they will step up and be more then supportive.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I fell pregnant only 3weeks after i was married. I was 19, and my husband 20 - let me just say our family were very shocked (so were we)<br>  <br>  But my parents, and the rest of our family adjusted to the news and are VERY excited about the arrival of their grand daughter/neice.<br>  <br>  In the end, its your decision not theirs and they will adjust to it|`|82BSdiyCaa	My husband and I had only been married 3 mos when we found out I was pregnant. Honestly, I thought my family wouldn't be thrilled, but they were! Hopefully, even though you have only been married 6 mos, you have a strong marriage and your family will see that and be happy for you guys!<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes!|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  We became pregnant on the honeymoon. Mom said "Already? Couldn't you have waited?"  Later, she did get excited and was a big help in preparation. Dad wasn't excited until the baby arrived.<br>  <br>  Their opinion didn't affect our outrageous excitement. It's been an absolute blast being a parent!<br>  <br>  Wishing you all the very best!|`|fE5zMOfJaa	I'm sure they will be shocked but in time they will probably be thrilled!<br>  It's good that you guys are married & not like these 13 & 14 yr olds who are getting pregnant!<br>  Sometimes things don't happen exactly the way we planned them, but it's all about making the best of your situation & embracing it!<br>  They'll be ok!  Don't let them get you down!  Enjoy your pregnancy!|`|qE6BlyCFaa	Sounds like me and my husband!! lol i am 20 and hes 22...and we were married for 2 months and found out i was pregnant...and everybody had told us too wait a while and were not ready..since im in college still..but hes in the marines...but once everyone heard the news we had no negativity..just support...sooo i think you will be okay...its your life and your married now and old enough to make ur own decisions...dont let anyone spoil your excitement!! <br>  <br>  goodluck =]|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	my parents and family were thrilled but I was 29 and I had been with my husband for just under 4 years and married for 6 months.  I can see your parents point but its kinda too late so no point in them being upset about it.  if you are happy they should be happy and if they arent then steer clear of their negativity until they come around.  congratulations!!
ynjgq4GZaa	It feels like you're going to jinx things, doesn't it?  That's normal, don't worry about it.  Part of it is just crazy pregnant woman hormones and of course, superstition.  Try to think positive and don't worry about buying things yet--you have plenty of time!|`|ojVl4Gowaa	There will be so much time to prepare for the baby later on, and after you know the gender you will get so excited to buy those first outfits! Like you, I'm very cautious of this blessing and didn't buy anything until I was in my fifth month because that's when I felt more secure in the pregnancy. I still haven't taken the tampons out of my purses, and even have a pack of brand new tampons in the bathroom from before I tested positive on the HPT. I can't bring myself to discard them, even now that I'm almost seven months. I just don't want to take anything for granted!<br>  <br>  Congrats! Go baby shopping when your ready, and don't feel overwhelmed by the task of preparing because your friends and family will help alot ;-D|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I dont think it is stupid especially if you are still in the early stages. Once you get past the miscarriage stage and start feeling more yourself and once you feel your baby move you will get so excited!! dont worry it is normal and dont stress about it because that is not good for your baby. there will be plenty of time to prepare for the baby in the 3rd trimester when you have the baby shower and get all those cloths for free anyway!!! babies grow so fast you will have  plenty of opportunities to buy cloths in the future
1dLGkSGQaa	I didn't get the back pain labour that some people describe.  It was sort of an "all around" pain though, but not that horrendous back pain.<br>  <br>  I guess I can say that labour WILL probably be more painful that what you're experiencing now, but it will be "better" because you know you'll have your baby at the end of it and that it's very temporary (compared to your infection, which is probably lasting longer than a typical labour).<br>  <br>  Congratulations - you'll be okay.  In my labour, I just kept telling myself that billions of women had done this before me and I could do it too.  <br>  <br>  Sorry about your infection.  That sounds terrible on top of the regular aches and pains of being pregnant.  Good luck with everything, Mommy-to-be!|`|4U9y2pLBaa	Not everyone gets back pain during labor. It depends on how the baby is positioned. I did have back labor because my baby was facing the wrong way, so I can't even really tell you what you should expect for normal labor.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	No, I didn't get back labor like some women do.  It was more like really bad diarrhea cramps to start out.|`|apSTH4TIaa	I am a mommy of 4 and one of the 4 I had back labor with for awhile and it was truly awful.  I have never had an epidural and the last 3 I had no pain meds at all.  I used the natural deep breathing method and breathe through the contractions.  Back labor is not like kidney infection pain.  And although it is very painful it isn't hopeless. I had an awesome midwife who told me to do a crazy 8 pattern with my hips to get my daughter to turn and after about an hour she did and my labor progressed pretty quickly after that.  Don't worry about labor, it will happen, but you can reassure yourself if you have knowledge and know what to expect during labor and delivery it isn't as scary.  :)  good luck.|`|w1drJWKAaa	Not all women have back pain. If the baby is positioned right when you go into labour, then you shouldn't have much back pain.<br>  <br>  If the baby is facing the wroing way (his spine against yours) that's when you'll experience back pain -- or what they call back labour. It doesn't happen often, so don't worry.<br>  <br>  You're only 21 weeks. You've got a ways to go yet.|`|PYySLOw6aa	there are many people that dont get back pain I was not so lucky for me it was all in my back.. so there is no telling
wiAVa1H5aa	I prefer to not speak about it other then to say (in a whisper) "she's in the family way" and leave it at that....|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I don't mind the slang, but I can not stand the misspelling of pregnant. Yahoo even has a spell checker and lets you know when you misspell a word. Come on now people spell correctly. Also, I answered a question and this girl used q's for every single freaking g. Talk about annoying.|`|AA11763588	Prego is spaghetti sauce.<br>  <br>  I spell it pregnant because that's what I am.<br>  <br>  You also forgot: pregnate ... what is that?!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Please stop ranting. Some people just prefer saying preggers or prego because they think it is cute. And it is immature not inmature .|`|fMnzjULCaa	Why does it matter? So many people use those words so obviously there are people out there that like them better than the word pregnant. My husband's uncle called me "preggo my eggo" the other day & I laughed. Lighten up.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	i dont see what the big deal is .. dont judge other by the way they spell, ure no better then the person next to u<br>  <br>  i use em sometimes, am i immature?|`|ca9dEvSAaa	To each their own. Judge not least ye be judged.<br>  <br>  Whatever. I don't use them, but I don't care when others do. =D|`|VS8mactUaa	I think it sounds cute, and since babys are soo toote, preggie fits it nicely. :)
OZkm1gALaa	hey! <br>  <br>  so you want your parents to adopt, that's really cool of you.  Maybe saying you're lonely wasn't a good idea but I think I know what you are trying to say.  <br>  <br>  You want the connection only siblings can bring.  I have an idea, rent a movie called Madonna I am, it's about adopting and helping kids out in Africa.<br>  <br>  This movie broke my heart and we are on our 3rd adoption.  Wouldn't trade the joy and hardships for anything.  Your heart is in the right place, there are so many kids that need homes!  Just try not to mention what you will be getting out of it so much.  When you talk to your parents concentrate on how much and how many kids NEED their help.  You're a good kid.  Good luck to you, hope they adopt 2 or maybe even 3.<br>  <br>  They might also be lost as to where to start with adoption, read up on a few non profit companies - depending on what state you live in:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.heartgalleryofamerica.org/Galleries/State_Galleries.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.heartgalleryofamerica.org/Gal...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck kid!|`|w2NA1KuXaa	you dont want to hear it, but it IS your parents decision.  Its their pocketbooks, their house, their sanity, etc.  You're lonely?   Get a job, volunteer, take up basketweaving.  Your parents arent responsible for providing you with a human toy.|`|hTieELhTaa	Why dont you just do what all the other teens are doing when they are lonely and want someone to love them just go get knocked up!! Kids arnt there to keep ypu from feeling lonely get a dog.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Ask for a puppy instead.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Oh my.  You are lonely.  So you want a baby around?  You want to take a baby, and give them a job?  You want to convince your parents to take in a child, so that you won't be so bored?  You are selfish.<br>  <br>  You may not want to hear this, but it is TRUE!  It IS your parents decision.  You shouldn't try to sway them on this matter.  These are children we are talking about.  Not puppies, not friends.  You cannot adopt a child just to not be so bored.  I hope to god your parents aren't going to have another kid for you, like they had you for your brother.  Babies shouldn't be adopted to fill some hole within the families lives.  That is selfish.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to volunteer, that just proves it.  Move on.  Get a puppy.  Get a doll.  Leave the children to people who want them for the right reasons.  Grow up.|`|9AKxBixNaa	Instead of this, and putting a lot of stuff on your mom, plus the waiting list your family would have to be on, why not sign up to volunteer as a big sister?  You'd have the same kid every visit, you can take them home, and the extra time you'd most likely put in would be very appreciated.  You'd help out another family, not just the kid you'd be spending time with, your family wouldn't have the added expenses, it'd look great on a resume (yours) down the road, and if things work out great, you might end up with more than one.  You could even end up with a little sister and a little brother, instead of just one or the other.  There's also tutoring at area elementary schools you could sign up to do, as well as community centers.  Churches and non-profits might be able to work with you on this.  As for wanting another sibling so you aren't lonely, I think you should have asked sooner, to be honest.  I have three older children, with two of them being grown, and the other almost there, and then a three year old.  I wouldn't change anything about their ages, but I do get a LOT of strange looks when one of the older ones call me 'mom' and then the youngest calls me 'mom', too.  A lot of people assume he's my grandson, but I have no grand-kids yet.  The oldest two have told me that the youngest is great birth control for them.  I hope this turns out well for you, your family, and the kids whose lives you touch.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	You are asking your parents to adopt a child so you can come home on the weekends and play?  <br>  <br>  Some parents (like my husband and I) are wanting and able to adopt children when our biological children are flying the nest because WE choose to continue being parents and have the desire and ability to do so.<br>  <br>  We did not get the idea from our children and they would have been the last people we would allow to convience us to continue parenting for years and years after we have the children we had raised and on their own feet. <br>  <br>  Our teenagers didn't have the right to tell us that we should be parents two more children just for weekend visits. And our 17 year old daughter HAD planned to stay in the area when we did! We thought how nice that would be and how we might be able to have an hour out every now and then at the time since our daughter would be around and involved...<br>  <br>  Guess what?  She stayed for two years and then went off to a college far away and has not been home since last Spring Break--and we still have a 7 and 11 year old waiting at home for her Visits...<br>  <br>  Thank Goodness our daughter with her older brother didn't try to convience us to make this committment to other children just because she planned to be around as their sister because we would be really Irritated at her change of mind when she ran off to make her own life.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, your parents will not be convienced by their child to adopt more children just for weekend visits! <br>  <br>  The number of children parents decide to have and raise is NOT up to the children they have to decide--Some kids don't want other siblings some kids do but at the end of the Day the Siblings don't get a VOTE.<br>  <br>  ***Unless, the parents do adopt and then often the other siblings are interviewed just to see if they feel their parents are the kind that should adopt but, that is a completely different Question.<br>  *|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Maybe your parents are looking forward to no more kds at home. Don't bug them.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Have your parents considered having/adopting kids at all? If they are dead set against having another or adopting no amount of persuasion on your part is going to change their minds. Were they on the fence about adopting? Knowing their concerns would help. <br>  <br>  Adopting is a big deal and a huge commitment. That doesn't mean you can't talk to them and express how much you want to be a big sister. I see no fault in wanting younger siblings either biologically or through adoption.<br>  <br>  You could talk to them about adopting through foster care. There are lots of kids in need of homes that are older than infants. If cost is an issue with infant adoption then foster care really may be an option for them since there is little cost. <br>  <br>  Like you said, ultimately it is your parents decision and responsibility. But you can always open the door to the idea and see where it goes. Just don't be too pushy about things.|`|pZg05uygaa	Wanting another child in your family because you're lonely is kind of selfish. It is your mother that will be doing the hard work of caring for a new baby, not you. You should tell your mom that you want another sibling and leave it at that., Adopting another child is a huge thing to do, and it isn't something you should try to talk your parents into like getting a puppy. If your mom doesn't want another baby, you'll just have to wait until you can have your own kids.|`|7JEojMgQaa	Big brothers/ big sisters. You have no idea where you will end up for college, and then your parents have to raise another child. Are they supposed to do it again when that one gets older and lonely too? Have your own baby.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Babies aren't pets to alleviate your lonliness.  That's sick.<br>  <br>  Ask for a pet|`|ajj7ATyAaa	You might not want to hear it, but maybe you know that it's coming because you already know the correct answer?<br>  <br>  Your parents would have another baby or adopt one if they wanted one.  They're a ton of work, responsbility and money.  They're already raising (or have raised) 2.... They've put in their time and don't need to have another just because you're bored or lonely.<br>  <br>  If you're lonely, get FRIENDS.  That's why friends exist....<br>  .  <br>  And if you want to deal with young kids, babysit!  Great way to make a little extra money and get your little kid fix in....

GZRHJBT7aa	Jude is such a great name. It's short and sweet. And the fact that it's used in a Beatles song makes it even better. My next choice for a boy would be Bennet. It's unique but not odd, and I think of a strong, mature person when I think of the name.<br>  <br>  Aubrey is such a pretty name for a girl, and it's definitely not overused. That's my first choice. My second choice would be either Violet or Avery. It's a tie, sorry. They're both very lovely names.

I don't like it at all for a boy.<br>  Ezra-I know this is a boy's name but the a at the end makes it seem feminine to me.<br>  Cassius-Not easy to pronounce, don't like it at all!<br>  Bennet- would be cute with two Ts.<br>  <br>  GIRLS<br>  Aubrey-kinda boring to me, but okay I guess.<br>  Pearl-sounds like an old lady's name (no offense to old ladies :) I just couldn't call a baby Pearl<br>  Wylie-Coyote, yikes<br>  Violet-Seems like it's getting way too trendy. Don't know if it's just because of Ben Affleck's daughter or what, but everyone seems to be choosing this name.<br>  Avery-I like it.<br>  <br>  My top two boys names would have to be Griffin and Bennett and Avery would be my choice for a girl.|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Boys: Emmett and Jude<br>  <br>  Girls: Aubrey and Wylie<br>  <br>  I would spell Aubrey like Aubrie,<br>  <br>  I would call her Brie for short.
cEXzXkqnaa	It is normal<br>  But let this be a leasson to you.<br>  why don't you get on the pill|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i would see your doctor if your still bleeding.|`|ygcbrp5Uaa	The shooting pain in your ovaries could be from an ovarian cyst. Many woman have them quite frequently and never know it. Most of the time they go away on their own and have no symptoms. But some that get really bad and huge put pressure on the ovaries and surrounding tissues which causes the shooting pain. In extreme cases, they have to be surgically removed from the delicate ovaries, but this is rare. <br>  <br>  Bottom line is, it really wouldn't hurt to see a doctor. I doubt it'll be serious or anything to worry about... When you see them they'll do a standard exam with their hands feeling around the area and putting pressure on the area in question. If they feel anything or you experience pain, they'll send you for and ultra sound and you'll get an answer usually the same day.

00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I would be fine with it.  I would just see it as the natural mother wanting to give a home to a child in need, as someone gave her child a home when that child needed a home and parents. I would find it nice that she was able to get her life around together and be able to parent.  Would I see an adopted-sibling via a natural parent as a sibling? The honest answer is probably no but it has nothing to do with them being adopted. I would not even see biological siblings as my siblings. If I had a relationship with a bio-sibling or a adopted-sib that was adopted by natural parent it would just be as friends.|`|HmkCFddAaa	Myself I would be happy for her. I would be glad that she was able to get her life together enough to be a parent. To me it's no different than my mom who went on got remarried, got to keep my youngest brother and had a set of twins. But I don't hold anything against her for me being adopted. I guess it would depend on how the person felt about their adoption. I have always been good with mine, so I have never had hard feelings towards her for having more children|`|j0xfBk5Caa	I would feel homicidal.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Wow, to me. That's a slap in the face to your biological children..|`|sbHJCxWCaa	Hmm, I think it would depend on the situation. I don't feel any jealousy toward my bio-siblings that were kept after me, because the situation happened much later. If my n-mom or n-dad had adopted right after they relinquished me I would have a hard time with it. <br>  <br>  But since I have a-sibs now, I think that I would accept new a-sibs into my life, but it would definitely have a strange feeling to it, I'm sure.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	That would be horrible. As an adoptee I'd wonder what was so wrong with me that I got given away and then my parents go and adopt another child.<br>  <br>  No they wouldn't be my sibling.  We would be totally unrelated and we'd have no shared history of growing up together.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	That is a huge slap in the face to the child that was originally given up.  It should also be a bit concerning to the adopted children (wondering if they'll be given up since they don't belong to "mom" and she gave up her bio kids).|`|RKcwfrGOaa	It's not that big of a deal.  No, I don't really think of her as my sister.  She was my step-niece for 10 years before she became my sister, but it wasn't a big deal.|`|hTieELhTaa	I would feel it as a slap in the face. like I wasnt good enough for you but someone who isnt even your blood is. I think it would really bother me alot|`|frpCK0utaa	i'd be hurt. But then, i was hurt when i found out my bio parents had another child together 4 years after me.|`|nESfk0bXaa	That would be it for me.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Each situation is different so it is personal,<br>  <br>  Before I reunited with my son I couldn't have adopted as I felt it would have been a terrible thing to do even though I was coerced into adoption.  My dh and I did talk about but it was never the right time plus I would have found it hard to adopt an infant. <br>  <br>  Due to infertility (husband) my dh and didn't have children and it took reunion with my son, talking to him, getting to know him before we finally decided to choose older child adoption.  Our views are very similar to my son's on adoption so he is very supportive towards us doing this.|`|Y8Vag6ejaa	I answered this question a year ago and stated that I didn't think I could wrap my head around that idea and I was right. I cant.<br>  In July I found and reunited with my dad to find out he had gone on to adopt  a newborn boy 4 years after my birth. I'm not worthy and hes adopting 4 years later? Unreal<br>  There are no words to describe the feelings. None<br>  I do not consider him my brother because he is not.|`|2B2RVbtCaa	I would be very happy for her because that would mean that she had been able to get herself out of the circumstances she was in when I was born.|`|98cAYrhQaa	I'd fly into a rage. I'd get my medical info and all that, then I'd disown the beeyotch.|`|1UvZd7Eraa	This is a really good question!!! And yes, I think this would seem like a slap in the face to the biological children.|`|AA10494763	I am not adopted  but I think so.  Most first moms relinquished because of being  in  a bad situation, money, no support etc.  Situations change some for the better some for the worse. Some changed because they gave the child up and were able to move ahead.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	There is no way I could adopt a child after giving my daughter up. My daughter would be horrified to find I had adopted, I agree it would be a slap in the face. <br>  It was bad enough that my boyfriend and I married 1 1/2years later had and kept her full blood brother. She asked, why did you give me away and keep my brother? Very sad for everyone.
88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	Talk to your doctor. The doctor may have info on pregnancy groups in your area where you can meet other mom's. You can cheer them on and they can cheer you on.<br>  <br>  There are already great answers here like "focus on healthy foods.  Someone told me she tried to remember whatever you put in your mouth is what your baby's brain will be made of.  She said that sure made her think about eating enough lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, veggies,  healthy dairy, and to drink enough water. <br>  If you don't get enough protein, you will crave sugar. Making sure to get enough B vitamins helps you to have more energy.<br>  <br>  Find some kind of walking that would interest you. Maybe pair up to walk with a friend to help you stay on track.<br>  <br>  Make a plan that you can stick to so you can relax and enjoy your pregnancy! <br>  <br>  You sound like someone who is going to be successful at figuring out a plan that works for you!<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|H20Qz1Tvaa	<a href="http://quiddity.cc/rachel/diet/wwfoods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://quiddity.cc/rachel/diet/wwfoods.h...</a><br>  <br>  Copy and paste that list into a notepad document.<br>  <br>  Delete all the foods you don't like, and use the remaining list as a guide to healthy foods to eat. The lower the point number, the better the food is for you.<br>  <br>  Be sure you are getting all the nutrition you need for baby though. V8 juice is good, and be sure to get enough calcium. Also don't forget to take your vitamins.<br>  <br>  Oh, and most importantly, walk every day! You will be amazed at how much weight you can keep off by just walking every day.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Concentrate on eating healthy foods.  Lots of water, veggies, etc.  Fruit is good, but take it easy on juice.  Juice has a lot of sugar, no fiber, and tons of calories.  Eat the fruit instead.  No caffeine.  No sodas.  Protein is good, not too much fat.  Read the labels.  <br>  <br>  Exercise regularly but not vigorously.  Don't get overheated and be gentle with your joints.  <br>  <br>  You know all this stuff already.  Get yourself focused on good habits rather than the scale, and it will come off after the baby comes.  The tricky part for all of us, pregnant or not, is to DO what we KNOW.  I need to take my own advice!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ykcpQhWzaa	go on jenny craig!!!|`|7273c2f9619f41237bda5553ffcdd9ddaa	Try to get a little exercise, even being lazy.  You can do things around your house.  I saw little tips on one of the talk shows, the weight trainer had the mom pick up laundry baskets or play with the baby.  Along with that, I would eat a good healthy diet, which you should anyway.|`|4WZMto1oaa	I say dont worrie about your weight if you are pregnant think about it later you dont need to worrie while you are caring a baby i know when i was pregnant with my first one i was lazy i didn't want do anything i gained 45lbs but i lost it i just walk every day|`|UA8nn5rNaa	my aunt worked out up until the day she went into labor and she didnt have any stretch marks or anything and she also weighed like 20 lbs less after the pregnancy|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Just remember that the average pregnant women only needs an extra 300 calories per day to support her new baby. Thus, a yogurt, a cheese stick and a glass of milk etc per day would be all you need. If you eat a desert, when you do not normally you are done. If it makes you feel better, I gained 52 pounds being stupid with number 1 and only gained 26 pounds with number 2. I got smart, and so will you! Enjoy it!|`|lzUF22l0aa	i know that with my second which im still currently in i did try to eat heathly and not eat as much junk. It is hard and i did cheat but if your strong willed just know it will be better for you afterwards. Also i didnt wake up in the middle of the night and eat like i did with the first i am 10 lbs lighter the whole time than i was with my first daughter. Good luck hope all goes well
qPCjUckvaa	HPTs are not meant to be read after the designated time that it says on the box.  I know of several cases where the test was negative but said positive a few hours or days after testing (way outside of the time limit.)  If the test said to read it after 3 minutes, then take that answer as the real one for the time being.  I recommend to everyone that they use a digital test that says "pregnant" or "not pregnant" in words or using a smiley face (I personally used ClearBlue Easy Digital and had very obvious results); the digital tests are much easier to read and do not "change" their readouts.  <br>  <br>  You may be pregnant and just tested too early to get an accurate reading.  Take another new test using first morning urine.  Read it during the specified time frame, and if it says positive then you are pregnant.  If it still says negative, and you do not have your period yet, schedule an appointment with your doctor.  I hope this info helps, and lots of luck to you!|`|7xit1ogxaa	You need to retest. The positive result is invalid. You should not read a pregnancy test after the time limit for this very reason. After the urine has dried many tests will develop an evaporation line where the second line would have been if you were pregnant. The evaporation line is usually colorless, but I have noticed with my own that after a few days there is a colored line.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Anything that shows up after 10minutes of taking the test should not be counted as a result.<br>  <br>  Take another test|`|0viZhxi6aa	Take a new test<br>  <br>  Call and make a doctor's appt<br>  <br>  Go to peeonastick.com|`|YUNE5QReaa	I think you should visit your DR, most home pregnancy tests can show positive as early as 7 days. I would get a blood test done to find out for sure.<br>  Good luck!|`|eRyCzwMcaa	Take another test.  You very well may be pregnant.  The second test should confirm the first.  If it does not, ask your doctor for a blood test.|`|h1AIzD9baa	you should never ever read a test after 10 minutes.. and most of them tell you the time limit in the instructions.. check out www.peeonastick.com|`|QVg9KB1vaa	It sounds like you are pregnant.  Take another test just to be sure.|`|bQk0vpfSaa	umm i would definately test again..and make sure you do it when you really have to pee so there is enough urine on the stick for a better reading
D35xKICoaa	Let her doc advise her on that the doc know what is best good luck****|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Wise boy for wanting to use contraception!!!!<br>  <br>  The pill is great for if your wanting unprotected sex ONLY if she takes the pill the same time every single day. Using a condom aswell would be wise, but wont make much difference...<br>  If she can't do this, then there is a little hook (IVF I think its called..) they can attatch to the uterus which lasts up to four years contraception.<br>  Theres the Jab aswell (injection...called Depo Provera) but I know too many people who have gotten pregnant on this...not very effective.<br>  Condoms are quite effective, and used the correct way are very reliable. NEVER double up the condoms as they break easier!<br>  Obviously the best contraception is abstinance..not having sex at all!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	the absolutely best method of birth control is abstinence - no sex<br>  <br>  ...if she is not convinced, let her get on birthcontrol but you should definetly still use a condom|`|f84b2b45d58a6539dd190e931fdc5a32aa	condoms are 98 or 99% effective WHEN USED CORRECTLY!  All too often they're not which is when they split etc. The pill is also very effective as long as used right. If your gf gets a stomach upset or anything you defo need to double up on birth control.<br>  Long story short, she should go speak to the family planning nurse at her GP's who will ensure the best choice for you both and they you know how to use them properly.<br>  You should defo continue to use condoms tho to protect from STI's unless you both get checked over and trust each other to stay faithful.<br>  Well done for being responsible tho!|`|0RFUKkBLaa	2 methods of birth control is better but alot of people dont do it the pill and the condom both have high rates of protection. I would rther the pill as condoms tear alot easier and more often. I would recommend the pill and you wouldnt have to use a condom if you didnt want to as long as either of u didnt have an sti. I live in the UK too and she can get the pill from her GP. Thats what i did and had no problems with it|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	you need to use both a condom and the pill to make sure that there is not child in your futrue at this very point. It is very responsiblte of you to ask.<br>  <br>  You can get birthcontroll pills from your doctor, or a clinic. Call ahead and make sure but for the most part its a yes|`|OJIXRFxMaa	Abstinence. :D|`|1quhJiuYaa	Most of the time, a condom, used properly is enough ~98%. Two methods of birth control is better than one. Usually a condom and an ovulation-planning calender are used together. Or a birth control pill + ovulation planning calender. Yes, proper condom use + an oral female contraceptive is VERY, VERY efficient at preventing pregnancy. In the U.S., we have Planned Parenthood, Inc., see the link below for offices near you.|`|vygYFdsSaa	For the condoms, I think its either 3% or 1%, there's a chart on the wall of my doctor's exam room. Condoms aren't foolproof though mistakes do happen. As for the condom and birth control, the chance is a lot more likely than 1 in one trillion haha it is not THAT rare. However, it's definitely the safest choice. Your girlfriend can get a prescription from her doctor. She can always go to a health clinic or Planned Parenthood, if you guys have that across the pond<br>  <br>  Of course the best birth control method is abstinence.....|`|b1NMh5K2aa	Sometimes condoms split which is annoying so using the pill and a condom is a good idea. If she wants to go on the pill she needs to visit her gp|`|3DBjrmGAaa	I was bad at taking the pill, I used depo provera. That was the best! No period!!! Only down side is, you will gain at least 10 pounds.|`|WHx3YDfTaa	the most absolute way of not getting her pregnant is abstinence like most people say
JtbeH1Mgaa	You could be pregnant or it could be caused by stress, change of diet and a high weight loss or weight gain.|`|HOdblqIkaa	it could be the different area youre in, new surroundings, new foods, stress these things can affect your period. if you think you are but dont know take a test but its probably just the changes in your life that are causing it to change up on you|`|SIfrAHxraa	take a pregnancy test....don't go off your period cuz it's different for everyone....I had a light period when I was first pregnant|`|94kNwMPdaa	you could be pregnant<br>  not every pregnancy comes with symptoms.<br>  i suggest finding yourself a pregnancy test in a local pharmacy.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Stress and change of atmosphere could cause your period to be late.
JZnRxPUCaa	Well right now I am at 26 weeks, but when I was between 16-20 weeks I had that same bubbly feeling.. like I felt the butterflies type thing in my pelvic area- doctors said that was the early movement of the baby. But as for belching... I was belching like it was going out of style. It would come and go some days were worse than others. <br>  My mom would just crack up at me because she could hear me belching all day long! So annoying!<br>  But that is probably the most weird pregnancy thing I have experienced :)|`|AA11256693	I'm 19wks with #3.  My first I felt the movements around 20 wks, the second time around the placenta was in front so I didn't feel much of anything until 22 wks. This time i started feeling bubbly movements at 16wks - and it isn't constant or even every day. Sometimes I'm sure it is the baby and then I will pass gas, LOL, other times I get a square kick in the bladder and I am *sure* it is my little moose.<br>  It varies quite a bit, but you will be sure pretty soon!|`|6KStmUBWaa	I believe I am 17 or 18 weeks. This is my second baby so I felt the baby move a lot earlier. But during my first pregnancy, I didnt feel my baby till around 19 weeks. So its a strong possibility that it is your baby. Or gas|`|3w7VztEWaa	I'm 20 weeks. i get those bubbles too and same with the burping so I'm guessing if we both have it.....than it's normal???<br>  but there are still bubbles..|`|k6RaKzqiaa	idk ,any thing about being prego .|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I will be 18 weeks tomorrow. It could have been gas that was causing the bubbles. Having gas is very common during pregnancy. I haven't been feeling to much really. It's been a relatively calm pregnancy hahaha
9a3sNrEqaa	OMG YAYY!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know u got your BFP!!!! yayyy!!!! Congrats!!!! They may do an ultrasound but usually unless your having problems they wait till 8 weeks so they can get a good view!!!! Its usually a TV ultrasound (transvaginal) a little bit uncomfy but if you relax it doesn't hurt as much! But they can see so much better @ such an early stage than a regular abd. one. GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!! CONGRATS!!!! enjoy ur pregnancy!!!!!!!|`|OseqIqMoaa	they don't draw blood very first appt. they just go over your family history and stuff like that. The next appointment they'll listen to the heartbeat, go over stuff, and then draw blood lol. And you will more than likely cry when you hear the heartbeat. I cried everytime lol especially with the ultrasounds. I still cry thinkin about it lol|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	they will draw blood. they more than likely wont do an ultrasound. i remember being mad because they didnt. they will probably just do lots of tests. oh yeah, make sure you are clean, if you know what i mean.|`|h1AIzD9baa	well because i didnt have an exact on my last mc they did an ultrasound the first day.. and after the ultrasound the clinic went ahead and ordered blood work.. so i guess it just really depends on where you go..|`|96HWpdkFaa	It depends on your doctor. They did on me because I didn't know when my last period was because my cycles are so irregular so I was 7 weeks when I found out and got my ultrasound and thought i'd be earlier then that. Every doctor is different.<br>  <br>  CONGRATS AND GOOD LUCK!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	They will do a pap smear. Most likely will draw blood. They wanna test for any abnormalities or STDs ASAP. They did an U/S at my first appt so, it depends on your doctor. They usually do them to get an accurate due date and make sure baby is in the uterus and planted properly. Don't be scared though, get used to peeing in a cup and getting your finger poked!
tcHkn0VIaa	She is already pregnant and has already made the decision to grow up. It would be cruel for you to put her through emotional distress about how hard it is going to be and how bad of a mother she would be. She needs to know the reality and that it is not easy but can be very fulfilling and rewarding as well. this is a life decision and she has made it already. Please be there for her and support her where you can. She will need good friends to be there for her.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I'm not sure where to find that information, but isn't that probably for girls who are not already pregnant? If the girl you know is already expecting, I doubt that would be much use to her now. Just a thought!|`|eya1WDS4aa	If she is already pregnant then its a little too late for that isnt it.|`|5cBbi5pJaa	The girls below are right. She's already pregnant so basically she will have her own baby boot camp. But I know what episode you're talking about. The girls on the show were put in a set up boot camp where Maury and his crew got already moms to help participate their babies. (You are talking about those little 13 year old girls who wanted to have lots of babies and would have sex with guys to try to get pregnant?)

Y5IUse1vaa	This is really a psychology issue. If you try to force your child to eat, they will probably clam up and do the opposite. You are best to ignore thier tantrums and take any food that you make for them and munch on it yourself, whilst making yummy noises. They will, ultimately, get curious and want to try out this tasty stuff for themselves. You will need to be patient. If they are still drinking their milk, it should be enough to keep them going in the meantime. Sometimes, fun colours on the plate will interest them. Don't scold them for not eating, this is , in their eyes, attention. One of the most successful tips is to leave something on your child's plate and just walk away!!|`|gKuHTs1Caa	babies will go through spurts when they won't eat. as long as the baby is not out of it,has good bm & is playing, it should pass. they sometimes do that when they are teething. try oatmeal or beans (fresh)??? something with lots of vitamins to get your baby through this. hope this helps.|`|79kPBWMnaa	1. Change to a fat free or 1-2% milk(too much milk a day can lead to being overweight)<br>  2. As long as he/she eats some each day then it'll be okay<br>  3. If you have to go back to jar baby food-do so for a while, one of the "good" flavors babies love like banana or peach, at least it's food.<br>  4. Try "cute" foods, like shaped nuggets or the shaped pastas and soups.<br>  5. Keep a weight check, if he/she isn't losing a lot of weight then they should be okay<br>  IF he/she does lose a lot of weight and doesn't eat "something" each day even just a little then call the doctor and demand help. Your child should eat at least enough food to make up the size of their little fist each day.
NVxGp317aa	I had spotting into light bleeding and clotting for the first 18 weeks of my pregnancy. Dureing the first trimester I was put on progesterone supposotories.<br>  I am no 24 almost 25 weeks and no spotting and everything appears to be great with my baby.|`|y1jCbUQ6aa	Yes I did with my 2nd. It turned out that the bleeding was caused by Placenta Pre via, in other words the placenta has dropped above my cervix causing some bleeding. This happens mainly in women that have had prior C-sections or other kinds or procedures such as a d & c. I am in my 2nd trimester now and it was recommended that I take it real easy , no lifting or anything like that because there is a higher likelihood of miscarriage. Because of the Placenta Pre via i will have a C section.|`|70kh6VSoaa	i am 34 weeks with a healthy baby boy and i spotted for the first 3 months and every thing was normal and still is its normal but only in your first trimester|`|xypA3yZMaa	No i did not bleed at all.|`|XZsd06Jwaa	not much,no and no|`|NcHsbFXhaa	yes I did, in each of my pregnancies (3 now), it scares you when it happens, but it was more like spotting, and yeh all three are and were healthy|`|qPCjUckvaa	I had VERY heavy implantation bleeding 10 days after conception.  It happened the day after my period was due, so I figured it was just my period, but then it stopped after about 10 hours which was completely out of the ordinary.  Once I took a pregnancy test (3 days later) and received a positive result, I was scared that I had bled so much.  I talked to my OB about it, and she said different women react differently during pregnancies.  Some women spot a bit after intercourse or if they're constipated, and that all usually is okay.  Keep active communication with your doctor about it, so he/she will know what is going on and can give you more direct feedback.
d7bJIgqlaa	Schedule an appointment with your doctor and dentist to get those checkups out of the way.  Then start a prenatal vitamin and take it while ttc.  You continue it once you are pregnant too.  Have fun for a while and then if you're having trouble or if you're in a hurry now then use an ovulation kit to help predict the best time of the month to try to get pregnant.  Good luck to you!|`|2nfMSDiPaa	Dont try to plan thing...when you do it never happens|`|JNDDFz33aa	Well if you don't know then you are really too retarded to even think of trying.|`|iIVnndPzaa	First you have sex|`|LaijpF3caa	lmao|`|OJ5OhyjTaa	do you even no what it is?

The baby is growing! :)|`|h1AIzD9baa	yeah its probably your uterus.. your gonna start having alot of little aches and pains here and there.. your body is just making alot of changes..   im 11 wks 6 days  i feel like i stay in the gym.. but i look like i stay in the fridge.. lol!!!  good luck!!|`|WEE6n2fIaa	NOTHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT !!! You uterus is stretching as the baby is growing it kind of feels like cramps.|`|gWwOpBujaa	its probably your uterus moving into your stomach cavity.  I had horrible back ache when that started happening.  my ob told me that it was normal to feel aching around the time you are.
1ikl5q97aa	i had protected sex and missed my period for an entire month and took 2 at home pregnancy tests and they both came back negative , so i wouldn't worry hunnie , just do something you love to do and relax so your period will come . If you might think your pregnant because you are thinking about it the woman body usually puts out the symptoms because you are thinking it so much , so do something you love to do to get your mind off of it and relax you a little . hope i could help .|`|1dLGkSGQaa	Okay, this is the last thing you want to hear, but anything is possible!  Having said that, it sounds like you took all the right precautions and that you're probably just totally stressed.  This has happened to me before, too.  You know what I did?  I went to the store and bought a home pregnancy test.  I took it and it was negative.  Stress relieved... then of course, the very next day, I got my period!  Seriously... go out to a 24 drug store right now and spend the $10 bucks or whatever on a test.  You'll be able to sleep tonight worry-free!  Unless it's positive.  In that case... well... at least you'll know for sure and no more freaking out for no reason.<br>  <br>  But it will probably be negative.  You're obviously being very careful.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1xlV9l0saa	I think your just stressing....you need to count from the day your period started last and count to 12-14 days and that is the scary days. This is all if you have regular periods. I know your nervousness can be way more powerful than you probably think and you will think you have all the symptoms.<br>  Good Luck|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	Yes your preg congratz!|`|sR6ppvhVaa	are your nipples brown? have the doctor rerun the test, or just take the home test.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	You had protected sex what are your worrying about, the tests your doctor do wont lie, if there negative your not pregnant, your stressed out thats prob why your periods late|`|yjhpBM11aa	your stressing to much! Chill out! Your causing your period 2 be late!  Pregnancy symptoms are the same as menstrual symptoms. I don't think your pregnant.
pj1NZfuxaa	I like it! It's pretty that all of the names have meaning.|`|9WciH0GXaa	Awesome lol|`|H9o3jdm2aa	Very unique I like it.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	personally I think it is too long|`|8EuaEGkyaa	Cute=] Love how it has family meaning too!|`|aqto0hJTaa	I like it.|`|nHhQ952Kaa	it's ok
QkY0bs0iaa	Well, if you have not been taking the Pill everyday around the same time, there is a possibility. <br>  <br>  Get a pregnancy test, or possibly see your doctor.<br>  The symptoms may just be anxiety.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :]
J2f5ZzSnaa	1. Grow up and stop calling it banging<br>  2. There is no way to tell you parents without getting it trouble, so stop being a wimp and do it.<br>  3. STOP HAVING SEX!|`|kDftsHXjaa	ummmm...you BANGED her? you little PIG. yes stop banging.... tell your parents no matter how u break it to them they will be mad and you will be in trouble.  You PLAY you PAY|`|LMc23g9Maa	Yeah you should stop banging and also stop trying to sound like a big man!  Only little boys need tell their parents.|`|zDNnon1Jaa	dude... first of all you are very immature 4 calling it banging- U are also way too young for sex, and also quit trying to get out of it- u were wrong and explain it to them and accept the responsibilities|`|i9M0U9Meaa	she wouldn't know within 2 weeks. but just in case. better get a job! and yes you should stop "banging" and grow up daddy!|`|AA11972720	Your 14!<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop having sex!|`|McuOwyqIaa	Well sense your man enough to have sex your man enough to have a kid and take care of it! You think your scared she doesn't know if your going to help she has to deal with her rents too and push it out!!!! Take care of it! And don't speak so disrespectfully of her! She is human and deserves to be respected just like every person!

MMF1YmZZaa	You most likely heard your own heartbeat. It would be impossible to hear the baby's heartbeat without very sophisticated technology.<br>  <br>  I would definitely take a test if you haven't had your period in 7 weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|96HWpdkFaa	You would not beable to hear a heart beat this early. So it was your own.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctors and get a blood test to see if your preg.|`|HOdblqIkaa	how did you hear a heart beat if you dont know if your pregnant? take a test or go get blood work done at your drs.|`|7xit1ogxaa	The heartbeat you heard was your own. You could very well be pregnant since you have missed a period, but you can't feel the hearbeat by placing your hand on your belly. Take a test it should be accurate since you have missed a period.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you are obviously too young to be having sex if you dont know that the baby would be TOO small to feel a heartbeat already...<br>  <br>  please go to the dr and get a test done.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	HPT is the way to go. good luck. if you are pregnant then the baby does have a heartbeat but can not be heard without an ultrasound or a doplar and at 7 weeks that may still be too early.|`|Myj4RBU6aa	not to sound like an *** but if your 16 and didnt use a condom that was pretty stupid. 2nd the  heartbeat could have been yours 3rd it take 1week after sex for the sperm to hit the egg so six of the 7 weeks you could have been pregnant. but the heartbeat doesnt start until about a month and a half. so your probably not pregnant and if you are go to a damn doctor. and get tested too.|`|FhRz6tVhaa	Take every ones advice Go take a test & go to the doc...
ca9dEvSAaa	I'm 37 weeks and the same way. See my Pic? Small!<br>  <br>  lol, Anyway, I buy large cami's (there cheap) and wear them under my regular clothes. I still fit my skirts (don't wear pants religous reasons)|`|AA12395149	I like the yoga and stretch pants at New York and Company.  They transition well to maternity too.  I have found that a lot of fashion these days looks like maternity clothes...as far as tops go.  (you know, baby doll style).|`|ZMWszpaWaa	try a size up from your regular size....i went through this....wore mediums then into larges...now im in maternity clothing... Good Luck and God Bless..<br>  <br>  <br>  Mommy to 9 yr old son and 18 weeks pregnant with second|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Buy a bigger size in regular clothes..|`|yQVcIfa8aa	try buying simple regular clothes but in a size one bigger than your own.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Same way with me....with my first and what im doing now is just wearing draw string pants and my husbands shirts.|`|J2f5ZzSnaa	Sweats!|`|AA11763588	Look into Bella Bands!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Buy bigger clothes. <br>  I never needed maternity really. I just upped my size to ladies and then bigger women's'.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Try one or two sizes bigger than what you normally are.  Favour the elastic waists that you'll be able to wear for longer and after birth. I'm 6 months and only now big enough to fit maternity clothes.  For the last 3 months, I've been wearing normal clothes in bigger sizes.|`|9cu82009aa	Yeah, like the others have said, buya bigger size, I never fit in to maternity clothes (I have a small bump and huge hips all the way through, that's what I get for having 4 girls hehe), so I just wear normal clothes in a larger size.|`|4U9y2pLBaa	You can try buying regular clothes in a size or two bigger. I was never big enough my whole pregnancy to fill out maternity clothes. I just wore clothes that were 3 sizes bigger then what I wore before I got pregnant.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	if its just he belly maybe u could get the bella band
AA11763588	Once the baby is born you can go to court and ask for visitations. The Judge will then order her to have a DNA test. <br>  <br>  It's really the only legal way you can get her to have one done.<br>  <br>  You may want to start talking to some family law attorneys now also that way you know what your rights are, you can start a payment plan, and you both are on the same page of what you want.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|7xit1ogxaa	If she has slept with more than one person then yes, you can have a DNA test done. That is one of your rights. How does she know who the father is? She doesn't know when she ovulated. You will have to wait until the baby is born, but you do have the right to a paternity test.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	There is a way of doing a DNA test while she is pregnant but if she doesn't want it done not even the courts can make her do it as it's invasive and very risky. <br>  <br>  Speak to a solicitor now and see what your rights are exactly and get all the information on how to go about getting the DNA done once baby is born. The court can order her to have one once baby is here. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|yQVcIfa8aa	you have aright to demand one if you think their is a possibilty the baby might be yours, seek legal advice yourself and one bub is born you will know for sure. good luck.|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	amniocentesis is one way you can find out before she has the baby.|`|OBPL49vWaa	one can be taken after or one can be taken while she is still preggo|`|6PUCUH8Aaa	Well she does not need to take one, cause obviously it is her child. But if you wanted to take a DNA test, you are correct it does need to be taken after the child is born, but after the child is born. Im guessing if she is not putting you as the father on the birth certificate, you would need to get into some legal things. I dont think it shall be difficult, talk to someone who does DNA tests and the rules and regulations as to who can be tested, and if you can just ask for it. Sorry if this isnt much help!
vsFJZRkGaa	she's learning how to vent and express, which promotes healthy emotional learning. <br>  When she screams explain to her "pulling hair hurts" and help her release the hair. <br>  offer a little finger or a toy for her to squeeze instead.<br>  <br>  she will grow out of this, don't worry :)|`|XOtOMncwaa	She will eventually stop on her own, once she realizes that is whats hurting her then she will stop... my son always pulled his hair, and still does sometimes if he's really tired, but once he realizes it hurts then he quits, and for some reason it took him quite a while to figure it out. I did try telling him "No don't hurt yourself" or I moved his hand, or tried to distract him, but ultimately he just kept doing it, they do eventually outgrow it, it just takes time... try to distract her, and try to tell her no, but eventually she will stop on her own.|`|rdKuvxYJaa	I do this as well myself but I have a anxiety disorder lol, try distracting her with a soft stuffed animal or a silk baby blanket plus rocking and talking to her in a soft loving tone until she falls asleep. { the holding or the stuffed animal or wubby blanket made of silk will add a calming effect and lesson the anxiety she feels when she fights sleep} good luck|`|TE73SFblaa	I think its cute when babies do this my son did it alot when hes about 3 m old.He stopped at about 6 m old eventually yours will too. But if you really want it to stop now I think mittens will work....try it let me know how it works out.|`|rAkWoweOaa	You know, my stepdaughter, pulled every single hair out of her head and eyebrows one night because she was so upset. She was a little older than that, but the dr.said a lot of little girls go through that. He had no answer, just time he said.|`|u94HOVz7aa	my middle child did this but worse she would actually pull handfuls of hair out. (she was the handful child)  i would have to hold her  when ever she got upset and kinda hold her hands or put mittens on her hands (sometimes i would have to put tape around the edge of the mitten but not on skin to keep them on) because she was literally pulling all her hair out. she almost went bald.  this stage only lasted a couple months (i know couple months can seem long)  then she went on to banging her head on anything she could when she was upset.  i use to have to put her in a playpen that was in the middle of the room so she couldnt hurt herself because if i held her she would headbutt me.  let me tell you a one year old can head butt HARD!  this lasted about a year.  and still now if she gets really upset she goes for her hair or throwing her self against somthing hard and she is 4.5yrs. I feel for you!  good luck and congratulations!
LDYAGJCxaa	I hope I can put your mind at ease by telling you that I had both symptoms AND mild cramping with both of my pregnancies (healthy children).  The fact that you're still having symptoms is a good sign, it's proof that the hcg is still high in your system.  But, it is also possible to have the symptoms and the cramping and have a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  Cramping is pretty normal during pregnancy, but with your history, I can't blame you one bit for being worried.  Try to relax and call your doctor,  He should be able to ease your mind.  If necessary, maybe you can have an ultrasound so you can see that everything is ok.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're going through this, I know it is very difficult.  (((hugs)))|`|3w7VztEWaa	well I'm 5 months with major cramping I've had them thro the whole pregnancy So...every pregnancy is different..surprise surprise..haha|`|uwd0BmFvaa	Call your OB/GYN immediately. They will be able to help you..|`|ddkVFlojaa	how old are you?
DSg4fgnEaa	Got milk? :D|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	No I dont believe that is a sign of pregnancy I have never heard of that before.|`|AcFBETxAaa	naw, you just have a special type of yeast infection that erupts on some people when they drink beer.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	It may be dry skin.  I don't know.  I haven't ever heard that was a symptom.|`|MHeOHOnbaa	no that is a sign or breast cancer you need to consult with your doctor as soon as possibl|`|K6U9kVQfaa	means u need me!!!|`|QzgkN2LZaa	not that ive heard of!! im on baby number 2 and ive never seen that symptom
Jo2DfRzaaa	I don't know if I would call it delay or rush with my kids.  i know that i was so excited and neurotic and paranoid with my daughter.  I pretty much wanted her to do everything by the time she was a week old.  (okay not that extreme, but you get my point).    With my son (my second) I've slowed down and tried to enjoy him more.  I also know that he will do what he needs to do when he needs to do it.  I am more able to let him set the pace for things.  I didn't feel the need to hurry things with him.  Whats funny, even with completely different philosophies with them, they both accomplished every milestone at pretty much the exact same age.  The walked at the same time, sat up, crawled, and "talked."|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	I didn't rush anything with my first. I was so scared I would screw him up somehow that I went EXACTLY by the book. I switched foods on the exact date he turned like 3 months, 8 months, etc. I took his bottle away on his first birthday. I potty trained him on his 2nd birthday :o). LOL  With my second and third, I relaxed and realized they can determine their own pace, and that's what we have done. My 9 month old now is almost walking, only takes 1 bottle a day, and eats table food with every meal (and baby food). It's been a long journey!|`|eeGN977eaa	I think I rushed things with my first two and delayed a lot of things with my youngest. In fact, my mom just pointed that out to me the other day. I still carry my 3 y/o often and she pointed out that I would never have done that with my older two. I guess part of it is because I didn't really know I was rushing my oldest and maybe I expected too much out of him. But another part of it is because I know my youngest is my last child and I don't want to rush it.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	With my first we didn't rush anything except for the bottle. She was off the bottle by a year. She was in a twin bed at two we never used a toddler bed. She had her pacifier til she was 28months but now she sucks her thumb.     Our twin girls are still little so we aren't rushing anything.|`|pwdgRBtLaa	well i have twins, so im not sure if it would be the same scenario. i really didnt rush anything with them, i just did what was easier for all 3 of us. after they turned 1 did take them off formula, BUT gave them pediasure to give them the nutrients they needed and whole milk. and my twins are still in their cribs, to them it is like their safe haven and it is the only place they will sleep. im too worried about them rolling around and falling off a bed because they are wild sleepers. my twins will be 2 in 3 weeks and they are still on the bottle but only 1 bottle a day at bed time, its sort of like a comfort thing.  the only thing that was rushed was getting them to walk, it wasnt me that wanted to rush them into to it, it was everyone else, their grandmas and everything, i dont know why but they did.   so i guess its just all up to the parent, i mean if you think its time then its time but if its not then its not, its just what you decide to do.|`|925b8594ae5633969b8af717d31ecb54aa	All 3 of my kids were off the bottle & on whole milk by 12 months. My kids are 3 years apart from each other so each one had the crib which transformed into a toddler bed until they were about 3 years old. I don't think I delayed or rushed anything.  I made changes when my children were developmentally ready.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Rushed with the first 2. Off formula at 12 months, in toddler bed at 14 months, followed all advice from docs, ect.     Our 3rd and last (tubal post birth), is only 2 months. I'm fairly certain we will do everything just the same. No reason not to really. I was sad while pregnant and just after birth that it's our last, and wanted to keep her "lil". But I'm over all that kind of thinking. They grow it's part of life lol, I'd assume give them the max potential to grow, learn, and experience things.     I compensate them getting big fast, by taking 10's of thousands of pictures lol...kinda helps.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	We did pretty much the opposite of you.  My younger daughter always wanted to do (or seemed ready to do) what her older brother was doing, so she just joined/joins in.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Yes!  I was so excited to try or do everything.  I could not wait!   I think my 1st daughter would have still like to nurse longer than she did though, she stopped when the colostrum started to come in when I was 5 months pregnant.  She was not happy!  I even started her in preschool when she turned 3.  My second daughter did not go.  My 3rd daughter I have hung on to a little more than the others.   I let her decide when it was time stop nursing as well, she stopped when she was 27 months.
nfzQkvqraa	That's how it has always happened for me.  With my son, we just stopped buying the pull ups all together.  We became a lot more strict about drinking right before bed.  We always made him use the potty.  He still has an accident every once in a while, but it's worth it.  I'd rather not pay the money for the pull ups.  Congratulations!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I have 3 girls and they all were different.      My 1st was potty trained at 3 completely.   I stopped buying her pulls around 3 1/2 for nighttime use.      My 2nd daughter was completely potty trained 18months.  I was excited!   But, she wore a pull up at nighttime and is 6 1/2 now and she has just gone 2 whole months of waking up dry.  So I think it's safe to say I can stop buying her pull ups!  I hope!!!    My 4 year old was potty trained at 3 with a few accidents & a pull up at night.  She always wakes up dry.  But, I still  put a pull up on her cause she sleeps with me and I don't want to wake up with a surprise.      so mine were all different.  I sometimes wonder that because my middle daughter was potty trained so early that this could be the reason for her nighttime accidents.|`|AA11481224	we have been night dry for almost a year and with us we noticed we were buying night time pull ups less ad less often cause he wasnt wet ad then  last year in july he announced he didnt need them and we havent had an accident since march of last year|`|Z1FdawAOaa	sometimes kids wet the bed for a while. my brother wet the bed till he was 13.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Yea thats how it happened with me.  Theres still the chance of course lol so i just use those piss proof blankets loll.  My kid is almost 4 shes been potty trained about a year and a half.  We still have the rare accidents but its mostly good. Your kid sounds like shes making great progress.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	my mom said i never wet the bed. After 7o'clock i wasn't allowed anything else to drink. I would get ready for bed and then use the restroom right before i went to sleep and then again as soon as i got up. she said it was never a problem guess if they have nothing to pee it won't matter lol.|`|5p7gpj36aa	Never!   He still does occasionally and he's 9!... Hope yours is sooner, Good Luck!
GZdvHbT5aa	I agree with this. My 20 moth old son is he// on wheels right now and gives me a heart attack almost every day with a new stunt he's decided to try. Both my nieces (4 and 2) are so laid back and calm.     But, my grandpa's old saying, as they get older.....    With a boy, you only have to worry about one penis.  With a girl, you have to worry about millions of penises.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Hmmm.   My oldest girl is all attitude, and my boy is the whiner.   Not sure which is easier to deal with. It just varries day by day.     Mine are 4 yrs, 1 yr, and 2 months old though....so they are still lil.    The whining is tougher to deal with during meal prep for sure. Attitude is tougher when trying to get something accomplished quickly.    So I dunno lol.    At least the baby is sweet all the time!!!! ;)|`|AA11537580	OMG I hope your wrong!!  my daughter is not easy to deal with and if it gets worst when she is older I don't know what I will do!!|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	From my personal experience raising a child of each sex, I disagree.     My son, now grown, was smooth sailing except for a rough patch in his teens which he got over. My daughter, who will soon be 8, is a royal pain in my u-know-what and always has been. I would raise ten more boys before I would raise 1 more girl, and have had this same conversation with several other parents who feel the same way I do.    Oh, and I myself was hell on wheels from the crib. Girls are not always easier, LOL.|`|3gSbn1nfaa	I agree. When I was growing up , sex and body image was a very big issue for most females. It was confusing for me because when I was still a virgin , I was seen as a "little good girl" who was afraid to do big things. When I eventually lost my virginity , I was seen as a "bad girl" who lost a good reputation. I am not skinny in the way that it looks like I don't eat at all , but growing up I didn't like my body only because I thought boys wouldn't like me. I wanted to have a bigger chest and a bigger butt because I thought that was what made you pretty. I realize that isn't true now but I know it can upset girls the way it upset me. Boys are so much easier as they get older in my opinion because it seems like it takes a lot more for them to get a bad rep. I hate it when girls are seen as "sluts" if they sleep with someone.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	It depends on the parents.  The reason this is true is because parents are more strict with their daughters.  In my husband's family, his dad was strict with his daughter (also a middle child) and let the boys pretty much do whatever they wanted.  Their daughter got pregnant (on purpose, just to rebel) at the age of 17.  She is 26 (almost 27) and is now pregnant with her 4th child (she's actually been pregnant like 6 or 7 times).    In my family, my brother was more rebelious.  My dad (his step-dad) was pretty strict with him and not too strict with us (3 girls).  They also didn't like eachother too much.  My brother got into drugs and alcohol and went to jail a few times before he even graduated high school.  He was definately the more difficult one.    What does this tell you?  The more strict you are with a child, the more they rebel.  So parents who are more strict with their daughters are going to get more rebelious girls.  It has nothing to do with the child or the sex or the child.  It's all in the parenting.|`|HyOltn2Gaa	no~|`|jWXm8EGNaa	I believe boys become more and more bolder, and also more reckless,daring, immature and Unafraid of things.     Girls as they become older are total opposites, majority of the time. But whether it be a girl or boy they can share similar trait, good or bad.    I think too much freedom is not a good thing. It's like an invitation to chaos. It's best to keep them busy with activities instead of letting them have TOO much free time, must make limits on the fun stuff. I could go on and on LOL.|`|a9qxLXMlaa	On the average,Yes...All kids are different,and I like to say "It doesn't get any easier"There is always something your child is going through.My 2 boys are more energetic than my daughter that is for sure.People like to say its the testosterone...My daughter is a fashion diva,sassy and sweet,and quite(I was told those are the ones to watch out for)Unless you are the Duggarts than its norm for your kids to drive you crazy sometimes.|`|c948af2ec95d5ed776cb2dc45b6307f7aa	In my case, that is so not true, my daughter has been a hand full since birth, and she is only 5, so I can only imagine whats in store for us later. I have 3 boys and there isn't much I can complain about with them.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I think that is ridiculous but maybe the kids I know are weird or something.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Not necessarily.  It all depends on the child's temperament and how the parents handle themselves.  I agree with Maureen here.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I  think so.  I've got two boys and a step daughter, and although they are still relatively young, I am already starting to see that I am gonna have my hands full with the girl!  My boys are both very laid back and go with the flow type of people.  She is a little ball of fire! LOL|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	No.  I believe that every human relationship is unique, regardless of stereotypes.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I think it all depends on the individual not the sex.    I have 3 girls who are very difficult.  And I know when they're older and "hormonal" it'll get worse.    They make my neighbor's boys look like the girls and they act like the boys.  Her boys are more laid back, easy going, my girls are dare devils, and crazy!|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I believe so. My mom has always thought so too and she has 2 boys and 3 girls.|`|AA11927140	This is what I have always heard.  :)  I'm pregnant with my third girl right now, and while I do not have any experience with sons :(, I did grow up with two brothers.  I believe this to be true!|`|rNvXWMOMaa	agree|`|N8tvMoqwaa	I have to agree and the reason I say this is because when girls are younger they're goody goodies and when they grow older, they want to go out and have boyfriends and as a parent it's hard to let go of your daughter because you just never know what can happen to her out there. On the other hand, boys when they're young they want to climb up everything and get dirty and even though it's harder to constantly deal with boys, when they grow older, as a parent you don't worry about them as much because they can defend themselves. =)|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I would say no.      Girls are hard the whole way through.  I was a horrible little child... and then I turned 13 and found out about boys.  Really gave my parents a run for their money.    My brother, my mom says, was calm since he was born.  He's a real sweetheart.  Gonna be 16 and he is great in school and just a peach :)|`|SnQvsOPwaa	boy=teen, girl=7   So far no difference.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Definitely.|`|Mzjoeld4aa	makes sense|`|oUd9ZIDLaa	I feel wrong about the boys lol|`|aCUHzMrmaa	My oldest is only 7 but yea... i definitely think that could be true.  Of course theres exceptions like there is with everything...but think about it. For a daughter you have to worry when shes a teen about pregnancy and for boys you really dont.  I will say that my girl is just as hyper and crazy as my boys though lol, and one boy is actually really quiet and polite compared to the rest lol.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	yep thats what my mom says. and she is hoping my baby is a boy.. so it will be easyer.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	If I based it solely off my brothers and I, yes, it's very accurate.    I was such a sweet little girl...but I know I gave my parents grey hairs as a teen.    My brothers on the other hand are some kind of super sons as teenagers...but the number of emergency room bills they caused my parents as kids must have also contributed to the grey hairs.  Lol.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I feel boys are just easier all together.       I really don't want a little girl but if that is what I get than I guess that is what I'm supposed to have.    But I want two little boys.    (out of myself and my siblings there are 4 girls and 1 boy but they are all my half siblings....but I know how girls are and I would just prefer a boy....boys aren't as whiny and not nearly as emotional and are easier to deal with)

sVmIi0REaa	You ovulate 14 days BEFORE your next period, deffinately not 14 days after.  So if your period began today, count back 14 days ago and that was when you ovulated this cycle.  Well, on average.  The average is 12-16 days BEFORE your period. So count back 16 days before your period, and then 12 days.  From the 16th day before to the 12th day before would be your most fertile time. If you have sex every other day within that time frame your chances for conception are at their highest.      As for the insulin, I don't believe it has a significant effect on male fertility or infertility, as millions of diabetics have children.  Although I'm not positive, and that question might be better directed at a doctor or other health professional.    I wish you nothing but the very best, and I hope you conceive shortly, as I know how emotionally trying it is for it not to happen month after month after month.. it's heartbreaking.    Good luck & I hope I helped !|`|4DoXomHZaa	No, unless you are 40, most docs will make you wait a year because that's how long it takes on average. 20% shot each month.    Buy some over the counter ovulation predictor kits at Walmart and use them. Guessing and counting doesn't work too well. And actually the average is 14 days before your NEXT period. The 14 day after only works for 28 day cycles. You'd be more like day 19.     A + OPK doesn't guarantee that an egg was actually released, just that tge body gave the chemical signal for one to do it. The egg only lives 24 hours.|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|T7fVO1HFaa	from my understanding, you ovulate around 14 days BEFORE your next period is due, not 14 days after your period starts.  Since you have a long cycle, the 21/22 sounds right.  Get ovulation prediction kits to take some of the guess work out of it

9LWuWHiMaa	my brother let me enlighten you. abuse take several shapes it can be emotional, verbal, physical or sexual.  for starters all types of abuse affects how the child develops mentally. children who are severely abused turn into psychopaths, they suffer from trust issues, the grow up to be people with commitment issues, they have problems forming relationships with people be it a intimate relationship to a simple friendship.  they have very low self esteem, in terms of feeling worthless and not worthy of love, they grow up to be a menace to society and give in to give in to the various addictions.Whether it be drugs, alcohol or sex. not to mention the fact that these children turn into terrible parents themselves. they are either overprotective of their children or have no idea how to be good parents themselves.   so yes, child abuse is definitely something to care about|`|XCrtAUTpaa	umm hello are u sick in the head   abusing a child in anyway is WRONG   it can mess with them mentally and some times physically   and not only children,anybody its just sick and idk if u r saying if it is or not but if you think it is okay then u need to get some serious help     how would you like it if someone abused u in anyway and maybe they have, u kno what its like, then stop the chain|`|YtSGbYqEaa	YES you should care you gotta be a sick person not to care about whats happening to our children|`|flqAr30laa	child abuse, spousal abuse, animal abuse, drug abuse, alcohol abuse,elderly abuse, if we have any kind of heart, we will care about this and do as much as we can to prevent it.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Yes, you should care about child abuse but you should also KNOW what constitutes child abuse.    Parents who spank their children are not child abusers.  Parents who beat their children are child abusers.    Parents who think it's okay to let their kid cry for 30 minutes when trying to teach them to go to sleep without enabling them are not child abusers.  Parents who let their children cry for hours and hours on end all throughout the day are child abusers.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Should we care if a child is being physically, mentally, or emotionally damaged?!  That is seriously your question....?    I really can't imagine anyone having the "opinion" of anything other than YES, we should care.  Not sure what else can be said in response to your post...|`|4DoXomHZaa	If you don't think it's fair for children to be beaten or neglected, yes, you should care.    Might not be your kid, but I bet you're against murder even if you're not the victim. Same argument can be applied to the prolife argument.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I was abused as a kid and i know no one cares about me personally cause im no ones kid and dont know you. lol but if someone did I wouldnt have hurt as many women, people, as i did cause of my anger. I stole, i screwed over women, dealt drugs, and so besides it making me messed up forever physically and mentally it probably messed up a little bit of society as well.  So you do the math.    To Sydwark:  Kids that were abused do not necessarily turn into bad parents, can be quite the opposite really.  I'm a good example of that, you should check your facts  before you speak.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Duh!     The ones that don't care are the ones that should be shot along with the abusers.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	why the hell would you not care about  children being abused?|`|E5CnUdhsaa	do i care thats there perverts walking our streets as a threat to our children...absolutely....if you ahve kids you wouldnt want them to be at risk...if your uncle friend parent abused you emotionally verbally sexually physically im sure you would care.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Of care we should care about it. A lot of children have been severely injured or worse.Why should a child have to live though that pain for the rest of their life?There is difference between disciplining and abusing a child.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Only coward ***-holes would hit a kid.  Not sure why there even needs to be a debate about it.

rdpZrBc9aa	Possible.  It takes a few weeks for the pills to work.|`|kg00hGyvaa	it only takes one little spermie to swim up and bam your pregnant so yes it is possible|`|He1WjHifaa	the bad thing about birth control is alot of people i know who took it had miscarriages once they got off of it or they did get pregnant while on it it increases the chances of miscarriage so you could get pregnant on the pill. its no where near 100% accurate but the spotting could also be a miscarriage. i would go check with a doctor especially if you feel cramping or have fever or any sign of miscarriage or if you dont get your normal period when its supposed to come

mx3gFmIKaa	They will observe him, ask you to fill out some behavior raters, fill out a background history etc.  Just so you know, most people will get a dx, there isn't anything wrong with your son, I've read your questions and its apparent he is challenging.  So don't be shocked if you get the ADHD dx, I was shocked when the neurologist dx my 2 yr old son with this, and I have been a psych nurse for many years.  And don't be shocked when they want to medicate, before this though there are things that can be done.    Look into sensory integration, "the out of sync child' by Kranowicz this can help    In lieu of meds we use wilbarger brushing, huggie vest (from southpawenterprises-bear hug vest sz med), and a weighted blanket from dreamcatcher.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	dont let them put your child on drugs..thats what its all about|`|F6lZHRkVaa	My stepson had a behavioral assessment done after getting in constant trouble at school. They ruled out health problems and did the assessment. He was 6 at the time.    They had a meeting with his doctor where they talked about their son's life and the changes he's been through. They then sent a questionnaire to his parents and teachers asking questions like "Does (the kid) have trouble sitting still?" and "Does (the kid) follow directions easily" and things of that nature. Everyone filled it out separately and sent it back to the doctor for evaluation. My stepson was diagnosed with ADD and is now on meds for it. Whether or not I agree with the diagnosis is a whole other matter.    In any case, that was our experience with the behavioral assessment. Yours may be different. Talk to the nurse and ask her what exactly is involved with this assessment. Don't let them try to diagnosis any major behavioral problems - they shouldn't be looking for ADD and ODD with a 3-year old. If any of these tests show a problem, look into 'behavioral therapy' where you both learn how to handle these things. It doesn't involve drugs.    Good luck!
AA11327039	Voice your concerns to your parent educator with the Parents As Teachers program.  To get in touch with them just call your local school district and ask for early childhood.  They should be able to send someone to your home for an evaluation.  The program is free and really benefits all who join.    Still concerned, contact First Steps.  They will send someone to your house to evaluate your child.  Many families qualify for free services.  They base their payments on a sliding scale based on income.  My husband makes less than $40,000 a year and we get it for free.  I think a family making $80,000 a year pays somewhere near $15 a month TOTAL for any service no matter how many or how often.  The best part is they come to your house.  My son gets once a week speech therapy and once a month developmental therapy and once every 3 months physical therapy.  They have provide him with assistive devices all for free.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	keep talking to her, if she hears the words enough she will pick it up|`|OOz5ox6aaa	That's no problem. Just keep talking to her. A lot of kids don't talk until 2 yrs or so.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	you need to encourage her more, instead of asking where her arm is aske her where yours is better go for the facial features as there more prominent ie the nose and eyes, get a dolly and do the same. she cries when you get her more milk because all she sees is you taking the cup away...next time pick her up or take her hand and say lets get some milk in you cup, and sheel soon pick up those word mean more...even the word more:) its common for babies to say word regularly and then stop, i found my daughter did this alot (shes alos 14 months) when she was concentrating on other developments ie walking etc.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	your doing too much for her. its easier for her to cry than to talk. tell your concerns to the doctor and LISTEN to what he/she says|`|n4tPArAAaa	say words and shell get to understand|`|xs6fpAkIaa	just keep talking to her and soon enough she will probably understand more words and talk more.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	I think she's fine.  I found when my daughter was your daughter's age, along the way she would pick up new words but then loose them a week later.  Now, at 22 months, she is finally repeating words that she hears.  Your daughter is still young and speaking words takes time for different babies.  All babies work at their own speed.  Just keep talking with her and telling her what things are (i.e. sippy cup, chair, bear, etc.) and she'll catch on.|`|3zzc32nfaa	A neighbour of mine's son was like that until about a year before he entered Kindergarten.    They ended up having to take him to a speech specialist, which set them back quite a bit of cash. But he was able to speak fine after some training, so it was worth it.    Keep trying to teach her to speak. If you can not, look into a speech therapist for her.|`|z7a9F4HNaa	please dont get so exited my son was not talking till he was 2 years .|`|QGELppw0aa	I am going to recommend that you do a search (web or your local phone book) for infant/toddler screening or infant/toddler specialists in your area. Some state governments offer screening services, or you may find in your area that they're provided by non-profit organizations. These providers are typically educated in child development, early childhood education, some are even speech pathologists or occupational therapists, among others, working for the state or organization. The typical screening will involve observation in not only the area of concern but in all areas of child development, using a tool developed and tested by professionals of the area as well as researchers interested in child development. If they find that there is an area of concern that should be addressed, they will get you a referral to specialist of that concern area. Some states provide a program of specialists that will be provided to you at no cost if the initial screening and the follow-up deems it necessary.   Your daughter may just be a busy girl, working on other goals for now. However, I assure you, by getting her an appt with her doctor you are on the right track.

I would make up something else so I don't crush her self-confidence though.|`|AA10556677	No. You don't tell her that. You just think it in your head and tell your friends.|`|3rrJRHrdaa	I know guys who do that.
aCUHzMrmaa	I would def. charge more money or at least ask if you can spend the night. A friend of mine always spent the night when she babysat that late because its kinda dangerous to drive home so late.  She sounds like a pretty messed up person to keep her kids up late so they wont bother her on sunday lol.  Charge more money for someone like that you have every right to.|`|irLnPW4aaa	If I were you, I would stay the night and leave in the morning rather than driving home at 4am.  I wouldn't let the kids stay up as late as they want...I'd let them stay up maybe a bit later than normal, but not however much they want.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Wow, 4 in the morning?! If you are able to stay up that late, but arne't happy with the amount of money she is giving you, charge more.  I would charge at least 50 dollars for the night.  If you feel it isn't worth it, just don't do it any more.
hieQHR0daa	The best option is to have baby in your room. Whether you opt for bassinet or crib doesn't really matter. If the crib allows a height setting so that you don't have to bend too low to reach baby then that is a good option.  A bassinet that is three sided and clips onto the bed creates an almost "co-sleeping arrangement" and some people like this as night feeds are less disturbing.|`|AA11330407	I always kept mine in a bassinet for the first two or three months. Well, I tried but usually they ended up in bed with me!  Bassinets are so easy to move around, I would put it by my bed at night and move it into the living room during the day. I wouldn't even bother setting up the crib until you have moved. Maybe you could use a pack and play playpen/crib when the baby is too old for the bassinet but you haven't moved yet. Any work you do to set up now will be kind of wasted since you are moving so soon after he/she is born. Good luck and congrats!|`|JsaEk8UAaa	I would keep the baby in my room for the first three months or until sleeping through the night. Once the baby leaves your room put the baby in his/her own room in a the crib. I would not put the baby with guests because you are planning on breastfeeding. You will be tired after that baby is here just because you are nursing instead of using bottles. I think breastfeeding is great - it is a exhausting but worth it!!! Let guests get their rest at night. During the day maybe the guests could watch over your baby while you rest or even help keep the house tidy!!!! Enjoy you bundle of love!!!|`|fjHpA5oiaa	I would use the bassinet next to the bed, since newborns have very erratic feeding schedules. As soon as he/she starts snuffling around (they root around looking for the nipple) get the baby and feed her. You don't have to wait until she's hysterical to decide to take her out of the bassinet. Don't even turn the light on, or maybe just a low watt light, just pick her up and lay back down  with her all snuggled and eating. You'll get a lot more rest, your husband too. And realize that your newborn is used to hearing the noise of your voice, your husbands voice, everything, and it is in fact a comfort to the baby to hear things going on around them while they drop into sleep. Stark silence and distance from a warm body must be quite a shock to newborns. Don't worry about "teaching the baby to make it on her own" for a long time. If babies have to flip out to get love and food, don't they just learn to flip out? Later on, when the baby becomes more aware, she'll be able to understand the concept of sleepy time, and that mommy always comes back when it's over. You'll be ready to move her into a separate room when she's more independent, and by then all the relatives will be gone.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Well in my experience it is easiest to just let the baby sleep with you. If you are breast feeding you can nurse at night without the baby having to wake up and cry to get your attention so the baby gets more sleep and you get more sleep. Get a bed rail and research co-sleeping. That's my advice.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I think you'll want the baby near you!  You should put the baby in a bassinet right next to your bed!  That's what I did, but when she was too big for the bassinet, I put the crib up in my room, I plan on room sharing for the first 6 months, it helps to greatly reduce the risk of SIDS.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	We had a co-sleeper in our room and a crib in his room.  I think it worked okay.  We used both for the first few months.  We also had a pack and play bassinet set up in the living room and there were definitely nights when one of us ended up on the couch with the baby either on our chest or in that bassinet.    Our guest room also became the baby's room and we just gave people the option of sleeping on the pull out couch and being disturbed in the night when we walked through to go to the kitchen, or staying at a hotel.|`|zwctZ812aa	I would just set up the nursery area in your room and have the baby sleep in the crib from birth.  Bassinets are useful when you want the baby in your room, but their crib is in the nursery.  If the crib is in your room, there's not really any reason to buy a bassinet also.  I would just save the money if there is room in your bedroom to put the crib.  Chances are good the baby will end up sleeping in your bed quite a bit anyways.  I was pretty against co-sleeping until I realized it was the only way my son would sleep, meaning it was the only way I could sleep lol.  Now I'm all for it!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I rather roll over and nurse ..family bed all the way|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Why babies should never sleep alone: A review  of the co-sleeping controversy in relation to SIDS,  bedsharing and breast feeding  http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/articles...

I wouldn't put baby in her own nursery yet, with people coming to visit.  That will be too easy for guests and baby to disrupt each other's sleep.
nsrlgXgYaa	I was in the same situation as yourself and I got so stressed over the fact I couldn't get pregnant and the more I stressed the more my periods were all over the place and this was giving me false hope when they would be late I have taken so many pregnancy tests at this stage I should have shares in clear blue. I went to my Dr for another unrelated matter and if you ask your doctor to check your fertility levels they won't refuse you. You have to go to the doctor on the 3rd day of your periods and they will take blood samples from you and then you will have to go back on the 21st day of your cycle for more blood test to see are you ovulating and your partner or husband will have to give a sperm sample in a cup now he can do this at home but it have to be brought straight to the lab and not left in a basket. Also when bringing the sperm to the lab you must keep it at body temperature as in between your boobs or in the breast pocket of his coat. We have just started our testing and I am due to go back to the doctor this friday for my 21day bloods. When myself and my husband discussed this we decided that we would be better off knowing if there was something wrong or if we were perfectly fine and that it was just a timing issue. Well best of luck with all and I hope you get pregnant soon.|`|8ZEqAwJ7aa	I don't have a lot of advice for this, I have never had this problem and I am sure you will be fine. It just takes some people longer to get pregnant. You may be one of those people. I would recommend that if you go to the doctor that you tell them you have been trying for a year. Otherwise they will not run tests until it has been a year.|`|ezMoS0mqaa	The first few months are the hardest because you put a lot of pressure on yourself. It would not be considered a fertility problem until a year has passed so gie yourself time. 80% of couples in their twenties conceive in the first year.  The doctor won't do anything for you until a year has passed unless you are having irregular periods for over a year or suddenly without any reason (ie coming off the pill)|`|4DoXomHZaa	Docs won't see you unless you have tried 12 months, unless you are 40 years old.    5 months is nothing...it takes on average 12 and some women much longer.    In the mean time, get some ovulation predictor kits to make sure you're doing it at the right time of the month. The egg is only viable 24 hours. You could get a semen analysis for hubby if you want but this will require a prescription from the doc.|`|PCRcoO6Waa	I think you should go now, because you don't want to wait too long, some people have been ttc for years like me.  I waited for a long time and it seems that the process is taking longer than I wanted.  You don't even have to go for fertility testing if there is nothing seriously wrong that you can explain like ammenorhea etc. just to get advice on the proper steps you should take with your partner.|`|QYurf2N2aa	well we're ttc more than a year now !! like 18 month...so i  just started to go & check for fertility treatments, for you case ,if you don't want to wait soo long , i know how hard it is,just ttc for two more cycles(ttc around ovulation), if nothing happens, just go to your gp ,& say your ttc more than a year otherwise they won't see you , after that they refere you  to a fertility hospital to check you(blood test for hormones,scan to check your ovaries,etc) & your partner(sperm test) , i suggest both take prenatal vitamins , just relax & remember there's always help , good luck . xx

HXfHkoSHaa	That's not true.  I got my 2 year old's ears done at 5 months.  They're perfectly straight.  Any time after 3 months is good.  They need their 1st round of vacceines before getting this done.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Not all babies have problems with their piercings not being level when they get older. I unfortunately did, I had my ears pierced at a few months old and now they are uneven. But it's not a huge deal.

Whose ears are they again? That's right. Let it be her choice.

But not noticeably so. I can't even tell the difference. But when I went to get my second and third holes the piercer noticed... No big deal though. I got my daughters done at 3 months old also.     Get ready for a lot of grumpy people telling you you are mutilating your daughter and shouldn't get them done until she's old enough to decide.     Good luck!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	That's silly. I'm sure they were just trying to put their beliefs on you without coming out and saying it. I have known quite a few people that pierced their daughters ears at that age and they came out fine. I say if you want to do it, go for it! :)|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	Anytime after they get their first round of shots is okay i had my daughters done at 6 months and they're even the main problem is getting them to keep their heads still after the first one is done|`|0HBXtFo7aa	Aww her little ears will be fine!

Xnr5Y7Coaa	My doctor told me that it is normal. I felt achy, not painful achy but achy nonetheless. He said it's normal because the uterus is stretching.|`|sSRHQkROaa	yeah that happened to me. for the longest time i thought i was gonna micarry because i was really achy and crampy, but my doctor said it was normal.|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Yes it is and I experienced it in my pregnancies as well.  It is your uterus stretching out a little and making room for the little one on the way.  That's if it is a dull pain without any bleeding.  If the pain becomes severe and accompanies any bleeding I think you should see a doctor.  But again, if the pain becomes severe.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|He1WjHifaa	i dont remember feeling achy in my lower abomen. i would say just watch for bleeding or cramping. it could be a sign of miscarriage. for my second preganncy i had a miscarriage at 6 weeks but about  weeks before that i had alot of pressure
9ZaoTkwwaa	i like Kylie Anne.  When you say it with your last name it reminds me of Hally Barry (i have no idea how to spell her name obviously!) but that's just bc of the "y"sound on the end of Kylie.  The good thing about Kylie is that it's not too short or long so you could use it with a long middle name or a shorter one.  For some reason, every long name i can think of has a "b" in it, which doesn't sound right to me (ex:elizabeth).  I like anne though.  She would have a more original 1st name but most people should be able to pronounce it right.  You'll be suprised how many won't though!  Growing up as Caroline, 60% or more of people called me Carolyn.  Some people just can't read.. or hear!

bBP1Xlnkaa	Although I think what the woman did was a little bit wrong.... leaving babies on monitors with people other than family, her being black has nothing to do with the situation. I don't understand why you even mentioned it. Maybe you should ask yourself why you feel the need to include that statement. I hope that you can educate yourself.<br>  <br>  The woman should have only left those babies with family or medical personnel. When my daughter was 2 months old she had medical problems that would send her into episodes where she couldn't breathe. My husband and I never left our daughter with anyone other than very close family and for only very short periods of time at that. If something were to happen someone needs to be able to make decisions for the baby/babies that reflect what the parents would do, not to mention the liability factor if something tragic were to happen.|`|QUA9EaZQaa	Color shouldn't matter.  But if babies are premies and on special  machines, there is no way she should have left them with someone who didn't know specifics about premies.  Even if not premies you don't just drop of your kid without asking prior to doing so.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Seems completely safe to me. Has she known the people long?

There could be a bigger issue behind that, maybe post partum depression and maybe its really bad...are you close to her? if you are i would talk to her and see whats going on if not then find someone who is close to her and make sure she is okay.|`|ee9b7879a87d003e8f82d18baefd1348aa	don't hate|`|LDYAGJCxaa	It really depends on how close she is with her coworkers.  I am very close with mine.  They watch my children frequently and I would completely trust them to provide good care if one of my children had a medical situation.  That said, it would have been preferable if her coworkers had planned on watching the babies.  There's really not enough information for me to form a good opinion.  If the coworkers were perfectly fine with it and thought she needed just a few minutes of personal mommy time (and were trustworthy) then I see no harm done.  If she's not close with these people and literally stumped you all by just dropping them off, then I would say it probably wasn't the best of ideas.<br>  <br>  And for the record, a man can care for infants just as well as a woman can and "middle aged" persons are highly capable of caring for babies.  <br>  The color of their skin has absolutely NO bearing on a person's ability to care for an infant.  Shame on you!<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA:  I know people who are kinda racist and that can be a bit hateful too, BUT, they certainly wouldn't bring any harm to a baby of another color...or even neglect to properly care for it, for that matter.<br>  I think you're the one who is being foolish. People who need to point out a persons race to make a point (epecially when it has absolutely no bearing on the situation) are irritating and are the ones who are holding our country back when it comes to racial issues.  I don't care if you're white, black, blue or green.   It doesn't matter.  If people would be a little more "color blind" this world may be a better place.
