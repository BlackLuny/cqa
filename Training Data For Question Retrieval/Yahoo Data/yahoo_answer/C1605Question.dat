20090223114922AAaVhab	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	If I moved back to Ireland would it be possible to get my accent again?	Hi I was born in America but when I was 5 I moved back to Ireland because my dad is from there and my mom's parents are from there. My paretns were planning on just staying there for ever since all my parents' family lives over there and it's a better place to grow up than Los Angeles, etc. . So anyway I lived there for about 3 years but then because of family trouble we moved back to America when I was 8. I have always "regretted" this and I'm 17 now and ever since we left I have always wanted to move back. Now it's time to apply to college and I'm applying to a few Irish schools.      So I was wondering if it is possible for a 17 year old to get an Irish accent if my dad has an accent and I used to have an accent? How easy would it be to get it back? Is it even possible? Thanks.       Oh by the way, don't call me a plastic paddy or anything because I'm not. I hacve citizenship to both countries by the way.

20090223112814AAMUxdY	Travel;United States;New York City	Why Do You Think It's NYC?	It's really annoying to go on vacation and have people ask me where I live because the conversation usually goes like this:   Person: So where do you live?   Me: New York.    Person: Oh! So how's the city?      And it's just really annoying because I always have to say that I DON'T live in the city, I live in a suburban town an hour and a half away from the city. Saying all of New York is a city is like saying all of Florida is Disney World or all of California is Hollywood. So why is it that people from other states think that New York State is just New York City?

I already have contacted a family and have a job lined up if I want it. It sounds like a lot of fun, but I wouldn't make that much money. Probably half as much as I would working at home. It is in Canada, and I also won't know anyone. The family kinda lives out in the middle of nowhere too, which I don't mind, it just might be hard to make friends. I would miss hanging out with my family and friends back home, but it sounds like a fun adventure. I just wanted some outside advice on what would be the best decision. Thanks for the help!

20090223123842AAX0AbX	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	What does it mean to be part Jewish?	I have recently discovered that my fathers father was a Jew from an English jewish family. My fathers father died shortly before my father was born. After his fathers death my dads mother was cut off by her husbands family, They had never approved of her because she was an Irish Catholic. My grandmother moved to scotland and remarried and another 5 children to a Catholic man. My Father was also raised catholic.    My father then grew up and had one child of his own me. Both me and my father are very different looking to the rest of the family as we are both dark and "Mediterranean looking" as opposed to looking pale and celtic like most scottish people.    My father gave up the catholic faith he was raised in and I was not raised in any religion.      What does it mean for me to be part jewish or to have Jewish ancestry?      Am I a Jew?

I've been there a few times before but I haven't ever done anything "touristy" and want to see some places this time. ex. the top of the E.S.B. and the Statue of Liberty. We are going to be there for 1-2 days and one night. So ideas of good but cheap hotels would be nice. As well as some good restaurants and other places to eat. A broadway show isn't out of the question either so a recommendation for a good show would be appreciated. Also I know NY is expensive but I want to try to keep the spending at a reasonable level. Other tidbits of info:    I am going at the end of may    I am a HUGE CSI: NY FAN so places relevant to that would be cool.   and I don't have a problem with the subway or anything like that either.    I would prefer the hotel to be in Chelsea so im near all the action.      Thanks for your help and please post questions if you need any more details. :)

I realize that several people have posted answers on Amsterdam here, but many of them seem to reference couples, families, etc.  So I hope you don't mind if I post something a bit more...targeted.      Me and four friends are gonna be in Amsterdam for 4 nights in mid May.  Obviously, we all know about the red light district, but we're not seriously gonna spend money there (just not our thing).  Fun to walk through, of course, but we don't really want to partake      Mostly, we want to meet some attractive members of the opposite sex, booze it up a little bit, and maybe hit a few museums when we wake up at 2 pm, mostly so we're not completely sheepish about our experiences when we get back.      If anyone has been to Amsterdam under similar circumstances, I'd really appreciate guidance on where to go, what to do, overrated places, underrated places, etc.  Thanks so much for your help.

We will be visiting Atlantic City for 3 days, then going to New York City for 4 days.  My parents - age 66, my husband and I - age 28, and my 2 year old daughter will be on the trip together.  My father can not climb  more than 10 stairs easily and we will have a wheel chair with on the trip for times when he gets winded.  We will have a stroller for my child.        We will need 2 rooms at a hotel, bed & breakfast, etc..  for our stay there.  It will be our first time there, and we will likely not return for pleasure for 15 years or more.  We do not want to spend more than $200 per room per night - for a total of 2 rooms for 4 nights each at $1600.      We would like to have a unique experience and NOT stay at just a random chain-style hotel like a Days Inn or something like that.  Some of the unique hotels that have been featured on the Travel Channel would be nice - but we fear they might all be out of our budget.  We would prefer one that offers comlimentary breakfast in the morning.      WHERE DO YOU RECOMMEND WE STAY AND WHY?

My story: After about a month of researching flights, I was unable to find a flight leaving Houston to Orange county on a Saturday, and returning 8 days later on a Sunday for a fair price. So, on Saturday I decided to make my purchase for a ticket for 7 days returning on a Saturday. Come Monday morning, I get an e-fare alert saying that there are now SUNDAY flights available. I called Frontier Airlines to see if I could add an extra day and they told me it'll be a $150 "change fee." The flight is 3 and a half months away, and there are PLENTY of tickets available for that flight, at the same price. I've called and spoken with 2 "supervisors" that won't budge, let alone answer why $150 is necessary to add a day to an itinerary with the same airline. I couldn't imagine it being a hassle to change a flight 3 and a half months in advance.

My dad has a large nose is white, brown eyes and black hair, its weird though, some of his brothers and sisters have blond hair and blue eyes!My mom has brown hair(getting grey :P) and blue eyes. Like i said i am not pale, but i am white. I think i heard my father say that far, far, away back, his side of the family might possibly have been Austrian, though, I am not sure.I don't think this has anything to do with anything, but i am not hairy, i have hairs on my arms , kinda a lot not really, and they are very very light, you cannot see them, i don't know...lol sorry!
