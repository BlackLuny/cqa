20090220072804AAeeaKk	Entertainment & Music;Music;Country	When is Taylor Swift coming to............?	Ok, Does anyone Know when Taylor Swift is coming to the Buffalo/Rochester New York area? When (exact date) and where (most of the time concerts are in Rochester, so where?). I am a really big fan, and only been to 1 concert in my entire lifetime, a Shania twain concert when I was 9. I am 14 now. I know she already came to The Erie Country Fair last summer, but these kind of concerts sel out very fast, so I want to jump on it.       Thanks to anyone that gives me the right information, and I will give the points to the first person that gives me the right answer. :-)

20090220073223AAaokCd	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Rock and pop: i write lyrics and i want people to comment on them?	Under the iron sea,    a whale has swallowed me.    But in the darkness there,    i didnt really care.    I jumped across the ocean,    with my heart just open.    For whatever i will meet,    for whatever i will see.    I was just prepared,    to do what no one dared.    My mind it was so scared,    my heart was not afraid.    From all what i've seen,    it was safer in the deep black sea.    So what you're gonna say for someone dead like me.    I've wondered laying on my bed,    i turned my thoughts to shreds.    What will i be?     If i always fed the beast.    It will only grow,    to something no one knows.    So i got up and said "thats just cause".    So big white whale, why have you chosen me?    I will do you no good,    cuz no one ever could.    My own worst enemy,    is all whats beneath me.    He gave my soul to you.    To see what you will do.    A surrendering soul,    thats me there's no more.    Its not really that bad.    Im actually very glad.    For 2 lonely souls to meet.    Under the iron sea.   There's only you and me   lets wait for what we will see

20090220073903AAvOK5e	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Y&R - Do you think Lily tarnished any potential relationship she has with Cane?	When it came out that Cane was not the father of Chloe's baby, of course Cane blew up, but he also turned to Lily and semi-yelled at her, saying she knew and didn't tell him. Even though Lily explained that it wasn't her place and didn't want to hurt him, I think she also could have mentioned that the entire time she was at the hospital she'd been encouraging Billy to tell the truth. Do you think Cane will be leery of getting back with Lily since right now he perceives her as somewhat of a liar? Or will they get back together and Cane will forgive her dishonesty (or Cane's perceived dishonesty)?

20090220074044AAQQ7aC	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Favorite Generation X'er song?	Good Morning R&P!!! :-)      Generation X'er's are known for their anti-establishment-wandering-anti-hero persona.       Got a song that fits in well with the Gen X'er mindset?      For me: Imperial Teen's "Eternity."        The lyrics are limited which fits in well with the non-expressive way to hide your true feelings.  The songs protagonist is definitely a wanderer trying to find his way in life.  And finally, the rhythm section in this song is to die for!!!       http://www.imeem.com/people/PQ6EQkc/blog...       I know of a few other songs that could be the Gen X'er anthem as well.      Any song suggestions or comments?
20090220074521AAFzvrH	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	'New music' nowadays - why are so many composers obsessed with creating sound effects instead of actual music?	I anticipate some really strong opinions on this, but I'm still going to ask it anyway. I'm not talking about pop songs, I'm talking about student composers studying in conservatories, or 21st century 'new music' composers. Why does the norm seem to be "Oh, I'm going to create this effect by making the violins slide glissandos up and down the fingerboard without stopping on any specific pitch" or "Let's have the woodwinds blow air through their instruments without doing anything else, so that we can get the shrieking sound"? Don't get me wrong - I've got nothing against 'new music', but I just find that most of the time the work is incomprehensible to the audience if the composer doesn't write a program to go with it.      Penderecki's "To the Victims of Hiroshima' (it's a 20th century work, but just for example's sake) is one of the rare few that's actually effective and successful. It really depicts the horrors of war and atomic bombs, and makes my skin crawl with terror when I hear it. But most of the rest just make me scratch my head wondering what's going on.       The other day, I just got told by my teacher that anybody can write what I've written for my orchestration/composition project (I'm not a composition major, by the way), because it's "too safe" and "not experimental enough". Given the fact that I told him I was going to write in the Galant style, you can imagine how I felt. I know I have pretty melodies and the texture is not terribly complex, but still, it was all my original work - a set of 8 variations on an original theme, totalling 200+ measures! I had already scored it for unusual combinations of instruments instead of the usual string quartet, trio, etc. He made me feel like I have to make the double basses squeak out at the top of their registers or something.      Any thoughts on it? Or am I the only one who's seeing this trend? Whatever has happened to the beautiful melodies of the past?      (And I think the classical forum is the best place for this question)

Dvd movies are released in the market 4-6 months from the date of its theatrical release. 4 months is quite a long time. I have hundreds of dvds at home and I buy any latest dvd releases.       I'm planning to write reviews about movies hoping I could earn something from being a film critic. Not dvd movies, but the film alone. Dvd movie reviews seem so intricate for me. I don't have special eyes and ears to give opinions on contrast, resolution, white balance, uncompressed hd sounds, notes, etc.      If I will make reviews about a film (from the dvds I bought) which is 4 months old already, do u think it's already useless, pointless, and not helpful for readers?

I used to hate family weddings before I myself got married, The old ones would always come over to me and pinch my cheeks and say "your next"  It annoyed me so much and made me cringe when any family member was going to tie the knot, I soon found a remedy to the "Your next" cheek pinching.. I started to do it to them at funerals. They don't bother their backsides doing it to me anymore. :)

The young man was quite amazed that he was   asked   such a personal question, he replied,   none   the less, "I earn $ 2 000.00 a month, Sir.   Why?"      Without answering, the MD took out his wallet and removed $ 6000.00   cash And gave it to the young man and said, "Around here I pay people   for working, not for standing around looking pretty! Here is 3 months'   salary, now GET OUT and don't come back".      The young man turned around and was quickly out of sight.

To those who have the new DBZ DVD's, I know it says on the box that the episodes are the original uncut versions, but does it also have the edited versions as well? You know like on some DVD movies, at the beginning it will ask you do you want to watch the theatrical version, or the uncut version? I ask because I really want to get the dbz dvd's, but I have a little brother and sister who also enjoy dbz like me, but they are only used to the Toonami version where they edit out the perversions and language and suggestive themes that my brother and sister aren't used to. Does anyone know if the dvd's let you choose whether you want to watch the uncut or edited versions? Thx!

20090220080048AA0gKlD	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Can You Find a Fitting Song For This?	This is either going to sound really odd, or like a creative challenge.    I’m weird in the way that I need songs for specific moments or people in my life. Only this time I don’t have a song...   Lyrics are the most important thing to me, but the music is of course important.      It’s the classic story; girl falls pathetically in love with boy. Boy gives mixed signals, boy turns out to have a girlfriend. Witch girl finds out about by seeing them together. And the worst part is that the girlfriend is perfect for him.       I meet this guy… he was out of my league. He was 2 years older than me, cute, caring and really interesting.    He was very sweet to me, but the next time I saw him he was a little more distant.  And then he made it very clear that we were just friends. A girl said    “Even though people are a little ‘huggy’ we have to remember that we’re all just friends here” he looks at me.    “Yes that’s important to remember” I can only describe that moment as stab, stab, sat, stab… What an idiot I was! Thinking he could like me. And Last time I saw him, he was with is girlfriend. She was lovely and super nice and down to earth. If I ever came up in the weird awkward and highly unlikely situation of being able to pick his girlfriend… She would be it.       So again.. I need a song. No love advice or: “It’s not that bad” because I’ve heard it all. (:    I really need all the lyrics being fitting. No “When I kissed you, you were so sweet” or “Standing here at the alter”   It doesn’t have to be from a female perspective, as long as it’s about the same kind of person/situation.       Thanks a bunch! <3

20090220080929AATVx6Y	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	FRIDAY'S JOKE - CONFESSIONAL MOMENTS?	After spending some time in the confessional, the priest opened the door and looked around frantically. He  spotted a familiar parishioner walking up the aisle.        "Pardon me, would you do me a great favor and handle  the confessional while I run to the bathroom?"  Before the parishioner could answer, the insistent priest  continued, "Really, there's nothing to it! On the wall of  the booth you'll find a chart of all sins, and opposite each you'll find the  corresponding penance."       The reluctant parishioner entered the booth and, sure  enough, someone entered the confessional moments  later.        "Father, I have sinned."    "And what was your sin, my son?"     "I committed anal intercourse"       The parishioner rolled his eyes in disbelief. He  remembered the chart and scanned it thoroughly, but he  quickly realized that "anal intercourse" wasn't on the list. Frantically, he opened the door and looked around for help.       Just then, an altar boy was walking up the aisle. "Quick, lad, help me out. What does the Father give for  anal intercourse?"             The alter boy replied, "Two Snickers bars."

Also why do we look up to actors and other entertainers (even sportsmen who I genuinely respect get too much credit) when there are so many people who have a genuine affect on the world and have real problems, soldiers,scientists, leaders,humanitarians, religous folk etc why don't we look up to those unsung heroes?    Even if they are genuine celebrities why should we care about their private lives?.

It would be wonderful if the song included "Lord" "Jesus" "My Savior", anything along those lines....Thank you!

20090220082625AANaXzQ	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	TMZ's reason for posting Rihanna's assault photo?	Do you think they did it for the gossip, or do you think they actually have a heart and wanted to make it known that it really did happen?      Maybe they were tired of hearing all the celebs wishing him the best and hope the get back together (Magic Johnson, Gabrielle Union). I can't believe Ashanti said she didn't know if she herself would've called the police. They all keep saying what a great kid he is (Terrance Howard, who it turns out is a wife-beater himself). Anyway, what do you guys think?       Did Harvey Levin and TMZ make the decision to shed light on a social issue which in the past has been viewed as a "private" matter?      Here is the photo:       http://perezhilton.com/2009-02-19-chris-...       I kno she is probably humiliated by this release, but not more humiliated by the degradation she has been suffering at the hands of her celebrity abuser. Like other abusers, he obviously feels no remorse. He said he was only sorry for "what transpired"...he was probably thinking of his career and lost endorsements.      But back to the question, do you think TMZ had a legitimate reason for this? Harvey Levin is a lawyer, you know.

20090220084019AAsZavf	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Libra Sun/Aries Moon: Forgive and forget?	Okay, so my ex has a Libra Sun, Aries Moon, and I'm not sure what his Rising is. I didn't know the exact time of birth, so that was clearly an interference.      Anyway, both of those sun and moon signs indicate that they easily 'forgive and forget,' but that doesn't seem to apply to him. In fact, he'll hold onto grudges for quite some time.      For instance, I met him a year ago. Within that year, I had a 'thing' with one other guy that everyone nicknamed Rabbit. When my ex found out I was even 'talking to' Rabbit, he was beyond livid. He called me a whore, that I was less than dirt, and that he never wanted to talk to me again.      It was ONE guy. I wasn't even dating the ex, yet he was so infuriated with me.       The ex and I got back together that night, because he kept texting me, making his overly "sympathetic" attempts to tell me how much he missed me. Secretly, I wanted him, so I didn't care.       But he emotionally abused me all the time, during that time we dated. Later I found out through one of his good friends, that he was trying to get with the long term on and off ex of Rabbit. He admitted to the friend that he was only trying to get with Rabbit's ex, because he's (still) mad at me for getting with him in the first place.      It amazed me that he could actually be so scandalous throughout our "relationship" all because of his immature jealousy.       That was all in the summer of 2008.       The part that amazes me the most is that I was hanging out with the ex again about...I would say, three weeks ago. I can't remember what we were conversing about, but somehow I ended telling him that he was the most attractive person I've ever seen. He smiled for a second, until he went back to normal and responded with, "whatever, you like Rabbit better."      That was so many months ago! I couldn't believe he said that! I don't even talk to Rabbit anymore. Rabbit is married now! It's like, he's still associating me with him, for what? He's still that mad?

20090220085807AApUCOr	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Looking at your chart, which positions would you say influence your personality the most?	These can be any- sun, moon, rising, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. Or it could also be any other house placements, aspects, or any planets that are in any houses.       ALSO... which positions do you think you don't act like very much? Or you see very little in yourself and everyday activity?       ---      As for me, I can relate to my three main signs- sun, moon and rising. Sagittarius/Leo/Aquarius. I think my personality is a mixture of those three in most environments. I would also say my Mars in Aries influences my personality a lot too. I have a bad temper  but I rarely lose it in public. I also have a Mars in my First House.       I would also say that my Venus in Scorpio is not very strong in my chart. I don't get jealous easily. Or even if I feel like I am getting jealous I try to stop myself and get over it. I'm also a little bit afraid of commitment-- If I want to commit to a guy for a little bit, he better be worth it. I also can't stand jealous and possessive men or controlling men. That would be a nightmare to me.

Hey everyone, I'm trying to drum up some interest in a R&P song covering challenge, you can find more info here:       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       and i thought i would find out what all you hobbyists out there are using to record and mix your songs. personally, i mix using an old version of cakewalk pro audio, and i use a combination of different microphones and a line in from a 8 channel amp PA depending on the kind of sounds and effects i am trying to achieve, i also use an outboard usb soundcard that adds better line ins than the one that was built in to my computer's motherboard. It gives me more input options and better isolation.      So, R&P musicians, what is your set up for recording?

So I eased my car over to the shoulder of the road, carefully, get out of the car and opened the trunk.  I took out 2 cardboard men, unfolded them and stood them at the rear of my car facing oncoming traffic.  They look so lifelike you wouldn't believe it!  They are in trench coats exposing their nude bodies and private parts to the approaching drivers.       To my surprise, cars started slowing down looking at my lifelike men..  And of course, traffic started backing up.    Everybody is tooting their horns and waving like crazy.       It wasn't long before a state trooper pulled up behind me.  He got out of his car and started walking toward me.  I could tell he was not a happy camper!       'What's going on here?'       'My car has a flat tire', I said calmly.       'Well, what the hell are those obscene cardboard men doing here by the road?'       I couldn't believe that he didn't know.       "Those are my emergency flashers!'
20090220090902AAyIleM	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	How old is Cinderella now?	After a fulfilling life with the now dead prince, she was happily sitting   upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with   a cat named Bob for companionship.      One sunny afternoon out of nowhere, appeared the fairy godmother.      Cinderella said, "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these   years?"      The fairy godmother replied, "Cinderella, you have lived an exemplary life   since I last saw you. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"      Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed, and after some thoughtful   consideration, she uttered her first wish: "The prince was wonderful, but   not much of an investor. I'm living hand to mouth on my disability checks,   and I wish I were wealthy beyond comprehension."      Instantly her rocking chair turned into solid gold.      Cinderella said: "Oh, thank you, Fairy Godmother"      The fairy godmother replied, "It is the least that I can do.      What do you want for your second wish?"      Cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said, "I wish I were young and   full of the beauty and youth I once had"      At once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful young visage returned.   Cinderella felt stirrings inside of her that had been dormant for years.      And then the fairy godmother spoke once more: "You have one more wish; what   shall it be?"      Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says, "I wish   for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a kind and handsome young man."      Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological   make-up that, when he stood before her, he was a man so handsome the likes   of him neither she nor the world had ever seen.      The fairy godmother said, "Congratulations, Cinderella, enjoy your new   life."      With a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, the fairy godmother was   gone as suddenly as she appeared.      For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes.      Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most beautiful, stunningly perfect   man she had ever seen.      Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair,   & held her close in his young muscular arms.      He leaned in close, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he   whispered...      "Bet you're sorry you neutered me"

20090220091409AARfrGR	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Want to know our company policy?	MEMORANDUM      As a result of the reduction of money for departmental areas, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.      Under the plan, older employees will be asked to go on early retirement thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future plans.      Therefore, a programme to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately. The programme will be known as 'RAPE' (Retired Aged People Early).      Employees who are RAPED will be given the opportunity to look for other jobs outside the company. Provided they are being RAPED they can't request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. This phase of the operation is called 'SCREW' (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers).      All employees who have been RAPED or SCREWED may file an appeal with upper management. This will be called 'SHAFT' (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination). Under terms of the new policy employees may be RAPED once, SCREWED twice, but be SHAFTED as many times as the company deems appropriate.      If the employee follows the above procedures he or she will be entitled to get 'HERPES' (Half Earning for Retired Personnel's Early Severance). As HERPES is considered a benefit plan, any employee who has received HERPES will no longer be RAPED or SCREWED by the company.      Management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue to ensure that employees are well trained through our **** system (Special High Intensity Training). The company takes pride in the amount of **** our employees receive. We have given our loyal employees more **** than any other company in the area. If any employee feels he or she does not receive enough **** on the job, see your immediate supervisor. Your supervisor is trained to make sure that you receive all the **** you can stand.

20090220092741AAxE4SR	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What's wrong with my guitar?	I have a brand new v series cutout ibanez acoustic-electric guitar. For the first few months, it worked absolutely fine. (I just bought it in November of 2008) But about a month ago, i started having problems with it. No matter what fret I put my finger on, it always plays the same high-pitched sound, even though the whole guitar is in tune. If i strum the string without pressing on any frets, it sounds perfectly fine. The only problem is when I put my finger on the fret. I even tried replacing the string to see if that would solve the problem, but nothing changed. Does anybody know what's wrong with my guitar, or how I could fix it on my own? (and please do not suggest taking it to a professional to get it fixed. the whole reason for me posting this is so that I could hopefully find an answer to this and see if i can possibly fix it on my own without having to spend a bunch of money taking it into a guitar shop)

20090220085851AA2VWOL	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Ive got a funny story?	A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl tells him that after dinner, she would like to have sex with him for the first time.      The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacy to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about half an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy a 3-pack, 10-pack or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.      That night, the boy shows up at the girls parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents! Come on in!"      The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were this religious."      The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist!"

20090220102053AAnBCtq	Entertainment & Music;Music;Jazz	Why is late 20th century big-band jazz so wussy?	I'm not a big jazz fan - I can recognize Satchmo, and I like S. Bechet, some B. Goodman (sing, sing, sing!!), Fats Waller, Cab Calloway.      But, the big band music recorded since 1980 has no bite, so little spirit.  It's like a muzak version of 1920s and 1930s big band music.      Am I a fuddy-duddy, am I missing something, or is that why big-band music is not very popular anymore?

I think this entire season is set up for a girls squad to win just to show diversity.   After Lil' Mama cried one the first show because the bone crushing squad was from New York she lost the small amount of creditability that she had.   There is only one judge that is a choreographer.    The winner doesn't defend their crown to determine a true champion.   I love the show I just wished it was dancing and more raw.

Ok so I've had this girl as my best friend since 1st grade and over the summer we got into this big fight and we're not really friends anymore, but we're in the same class. We each have our own best friends and all. I was looking through my old emails, and i was reading all the ones between us of us joking around and stuff, and then came the ones of us fighting. Then the emails ended. I haven't really talked to her in a while, but we see eachother in class and stuff.   I don't want to be best friends anymore, but i was just kind of missing our friendship.

In your part of the world, do you pronounce it 'Cara-be-An' or 'Ca-rib-bee-an'?  ;-)    When Billy Ocean had a big hit in the 80s with 'Carribean Queen' he release 2 versions where he pronounced it differently in each version, for cultural reasons.  He even did a 3rd version called 'African Queen' with same lyrics except the one.  So, which way do you guys pronounce it and tell us where you're from so we can know who pronounces it which way?    Thanks :-)

Strange people are here         from:   http://laugh-a-cow.com/top10.php             There was a young Scottish boy called Angus who decided to try life in Australia. He found an apartment in a small block and settled in.       After a week or two, his mother called from Aberdeen to see how her son was doing in his new life.       'I'm fine, ' Angus said. 'But there are some really strange people living in these apartments. One woman cried all day long, another lies on her floor moaning, and there is a guy next door to me who bangs his head on the wall all the time.'       'Well, ma laddie,' says his mother, 'I suggest you don't associate with people like that.'       'Oh,' says Angus, 'I don't, Mam, I don't. No, I just stay inside my apartment all day and night, playing my bagpipes.'
