20090308091912AAv7qGZ	Arts & Humanities;History	Has capitalism been defeated by greedism?	Greedism is an economic doctrine that supports extreme exploitation and hoarding of un needed wealth at the expense of the exploited.   How much does an average American needs to live our finite life?   An estate tycoon WILLED $3 billion to a dog in the very USA where people are loosing houses to foreclosure?   It is not time to introduce maximum wealth/wage for every individual in our world?   Is it not time for the world to change the way Business are done like capping xxv profit/exploitation?

This sounds very lame, but i've totally forgotten how many times you turn the paper over to trace something. Like, i have the image i'm tracing taped underneath a piece of tracing paper. So i've drawn over it once, then what do i do?   Do i have to turn it over again, go over the lines on the other side, and then put it on paper, or not? Becuase surely otherwise the image would be backwards? :S

Cooks Brooks   At the pool where we used to swim   In Cooks Brook   Not everyone had guts enough   To dive from the top ledge      Not that it would have been   A difficult dive   Except for the shelf of rock   That lay two feet below the surface   And reached quarter of the way out   Into the width of the pool 10      One by one the brave few of us   Would climb the cliff to the ledge   And stand poised   Ready to plunge headfirst   Into the dark water below   And always there was that moment of terror   When you’d doubt that you could   Clear the shelf   Knowing full well 20   It would be better to die   Skull smashed open in the water   Than it would be to climb   Backwards down to the beach      So always there was that moment   When you prayed for wings   Then sailed arms outspread into the buoyant air   What you feel is something   Impossible to describe   As the water parts like a wound 30    To engulf you   Then closes just as quickly   In a white scar where you entered      And you are surprised always   To find yourself alive   Following the streaks of sunlight   That lead you gasping to the surface   Where you make your way   Leisurely to shore   As though there had been nothing to it 40   As though it was every day of the week   You daringly defied the demons   Who lived so terribly   In the haunted hours of your sleep

20090308094703AATh9qj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Have I made any glaring mistakes?  Or: what's one more snippet of fiction in this section?	A quick sketch in an attempt to alleviate the dreaded writer's block:        Haruto frowned softly.  "I...  I'm not sure if that's a good idea."  He watched his captor's face, expecting the usual confusion, followed quickly by anger.     True to form, Abe's face went from smug satisfaction to indignation with a remarkable swiftness.  "Why not?"     Haruto's normally pale complexion took on a slight flush.  He was getting rather tired of having to explain these things.  "Because.  You see how the passage opens up into a forest valley?"  He pointed to a large, jagged oval on the map between the two of them, colored green to suggest a forest.     "Yea.  So?"     "So...  You can't think of a reason why charging through this area would be a bad idea?"  This was not the first time they had had such a talk; Haruto had made a note after every such discussion to explain it as he would to a progressively younger person.  Thus far he was down to a 16-year-old, and still had apparently set the bar too high.     "Nope.  They've got all of their men in the central pass and at the port to the south.  The lines here are weak."     "...You know they likely noticed the thinness of the line there, too, right?"     "Yea, so?"     Haruto had finally had enough.  "...You're an idiot."     Abraham stared at him for a moment, anger transfixed on his face.  Obviously, of all of the things he had been expecting, that was not one of them.     Seeing his companion without response, Haruto opted to continue: "The reason the line there is thin is because they want you to be an idiot and charge through, so that they can ambush you in the valley, cut off your escape route, and surround you.  Haven't you figured out that these people know what they're doing yet?  Haven't you already fallen for this trick TWICE?"     Abe's brow furrowed in anger, and his face went red.  Haruto saw what was about to happen about a half a second before it did; the table was overturned, and the young man found himself pinned beneath the weight of someone nearly twice his size, a pair of clawed hands around his throat.  Haruto panicked for a moment, franticly clawing at the furry arms above him, before relaxing.  It hurt quite a bit, but by now he was used to pain.  Abraham would rough him up, but knew better then to kill him; after all, Haruto had yet to be wrong.     Slowly, the hands relinquished their grip on Haruto's throat.  Abraham hauled the young man up, then shoved him roughly away.  He took a few deep breaths, massive chest rising and falling beneath his tunic.  "Alrigh', smart-***, if yer' so smart, what do we do?"     Haruto brushed off one of his sleeves.  Inwardly, he was terrified.  Abraham had become increasingly violent as time went on; odds are next time he might lack the restraint necessary from tearing his captive strategist's throat out with his teeth.  Outwardly, though, he did his best to put on a cool, if timid, demeanor: Abraham seemed like that, perhaps because it made him feel in control of a situation that was too large for him to handle.     Haruto picked the table back up, grunting slightly from the effort.  "Alright.  If you want to take the city, this is what you're going to need to do."      Three things to bare in mind:   1) Writers block   2) This is a sketch taken from somewhere in the middle of a story I'm working on, made up on the spot, largely due to the above.  Thus the entire plot may not make as much sense as it would with more context.   3) I'm operating on very little sleep, thanks to on-going insomnia.   That said, please be gentle.  Constructive criticism greatly appreciated.

20090308095823AA2NKGg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Read,Answer,Criticize. Thanx?	I'm 13 and have thought of an idea for a book i would like you to read Chapter 1 and answer questions at end. Thank you      Chapter 1      I don't go out. Going out is a distraction. I don't need distractions. Distractions slow me down. When they found me they trained me to do only as they say. I obeyed willingly not knowing much of life.    I was only 15 when they found me curled in a ball shivering, scared, unable to move. I was frozen by grief, before my eyes they killed my mother,father,my whole family. I was left, not bothering to fight. I would have rathered to die than suffer the pain of life without family. They disagreed, they took me even though i was weak,they took me to a grey,derelict building. I wasn't paying attention all i was thinking about was "Am i dead yet". They took me to a room and lay me in a soft, comfortable bed.I slept not thinking about my surroundings or why they treated me with care.   Next day i awoke in the same soft bed. Not knowing what to do, until  a soft faced woman came in and told me i was to be trained and i was to obey them or i would be terminated.I trained, learning fast, finding all these new ways easy to me. I obeyed every order never stepping out of line.   After a year of training they told me what i was to do with myself, what my official job was to be. They told me there was some people who didn't deserve to be on the planet, some people were just plainly useless. They said I would do the world a favor be terminating all the useless on the world. I agreed as i was already trained to always agree with them what would be the difference in this small decision.   I didn't know i would regret this decision so much when i met him. Jason was different i was friends with him it evolved i din't know they would find out.   "Wheres Jason"I screamed inflicting my pain into the question.   "You don't know a Jason. All you know is to terminate the useless. That is your only asset" he said spitting the pain enducing words at me.   "I want to see Jason"   "You will never see Jason"   I wept as the lashings increased in strength.   Thats when i made my decision i would terminate all who got in my way all who would stop me from getting to my jason.      be brutal please while answering.   I think the story isn't that great myself as it dosen't have a real good story to it.   But please criticise as much as possible.   tell me all good and bad points.      Thanks

I don't want to pay for ancestry.com because I have not had a lot of success there and every time I found something, they wanted me to pay for another service! Argh.      The short version:   My grandfather is Pat (Pascuale) Scamacca and he changed his name prior to the 1940's to Nicholas Trapini. Before that, he married a woman named Anna Loria and had two children, Sam and Gina/Jean/Domenica which we are not totally sure. Sam was a "midget" (this is the term used in the documents I have, sorry for being offensive) and he died I think in the 1980s. Gina (?) went on to marry Frank Patinka and had 4-5 kids, got divorced and we think all the kids went to group homes. My grandfather left his wife (Anna Loria) and went off with my grandmother "Phyllis Humphrey/Harrington" (?), and had four children Patsy, Jim, and twins Fred (my dad), and Ted (how original), and never went back to his old life. We do not have a lot of details, my grandfather died before we found any of this out.      Anyway, we are looking for Gina/Regina/Jean whatever under the names Scamacca, Loria, and Patinka. We do know that my grandfather's first wife's father had a business called Loria Motors in NJ, but it seems that it has since shut down since I can't find any information on it. We also know that Gina, at one time,  lived in Davenport Center, NY. My dad and his siblings met their sister once, but she has been "missing" ever since. We would like to locate her children and any other relatives we might have.

Well I had checked to see if it was already a book and I couldn't find anything but today I typed it in for the fun of it and another book with the same title popped up. I was wondering if the author held copyright to the title of the book, because she also has a number of other books with The _____ One - which would be my only other alternatives considering the title has to be what the characters refer to him as. So would it be safe to name my title this?      And also I found out on Wikipedia that another book has a character referred to as 'the dark one' as well as a number of other things and I was wondering if the author would hold copyright to what he is referred to? Or would it just be for that specific character?

20090306234315AA4GuD5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this?	Just as a clock struck midnight, the shadowy figure of a man emerged from behind King Fowlin's throne. The rest of the throne room was deserted.     He silently crossed the space to the doorway and sped down the hall and up a flight of stairs into another hall. Doors of all different shapes and colors stood out from the dark walls. Suddenly he stopped in front of purple door with golden stars.    Quicker than lightning, his hand was on the knob and he threw open the door even faster to avoid it making noise.                    The room was a too vast for its contents. What should have been lavishly decorated like a human master suite was instead scarcely half-full. The walls looked a dull blue color in the moonlight and the floor had a thin layer of dust that had footprints in it, as if the room hadn't been used until recently.    Standing by the far back wall next to a veranda was a newly painted crib. He could still smell it. Inside the crib, something was moving. Leaving the door wide open, the figure cautiously went to inspect the crib.    It was a baby; a baby girl wrapped in a light pink blanket. Why she was still awake, he didn't know, but that wasn't important right now. Very carefully, he picked her up and held her gently. Her bright blue right eye and dark grey left eye stared up at him, as she gurgled. So this was her, the blessed baby girl that had been born into the royal family, as had been prophesized by her grandmother. Now she was all his.   He had gotten in, collected the baby, and now all he had to do was get out. Going to stand on the balcony, he estimated the jump to the ground. He knew that he could make it uninjured, but with the princess, he wasn't so sure. There was only one way to find out.   With the princess in one arm, he used the other to climb on top of the railing and then he jumped. He landed nimbly with his knees slightly bent and then quickly straightened himself. Then he started running. He went straight through the courtyard, sprinted through the main gates and out into the darkness.   And nobody saw a single thing.    -Livvy

He may have died from old age already. It would put closure to many relatives if I can find out anything about him. Or even where he was buried(if he did die). I read that the government gives free access to peoples background, birth certificate, military history, etc. and is in the public domain.

His name is very common and some of these sites charge $20+ to search for one name of a list of hundreds and that's just one state I'm guessing he might be in.

20090306220833AAwYzwh	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Does this sonnet grab you?	Limbs bucking helpless, driven by the noise,   Glancing strangers, seeing nothing that's fit,   - Dark harlequin diamonds strafing our eyes -    Nothing that rests beyond a moment's beat.      Clutching at phantom dreams that wink and veer,   Following shadow dancers in our mind;   Rendered deaf by the bumping thundered blur   Of sound, mute to the touch of eye or hand.      Then some dances, like last farewells, are slow,   As if to garner from a long harvest   All that touch and harmony can bestow,   When sweet fulfilment gathers in the best.      So have your fling and bop with who you see,   But as they say, save the last dance for me.

They all gathered around Mum's bed -    Dad and the midwife and Mum's sister   and Ceri. "Move over a bit" Dad said -    he was trying to focus the camcorder on Mum's legs and the baby's head.   After she had a little sister,   and Mum had gone back to being thin,   and was twice as busy, Ceri played    the video again and again.   She watched Laura come out, and the,   in reverse, she made her go back in.      I think that this is iambic, but i'm not sure.

Untitled   By Koye Lott      Grief, a lone actor of sullen talents   Often appears on the world's largest stage   Sharing the marquee with the great and small   Knowing no curtain call.... only a work ethic   Unmatched by any but Death himself...      Yet in all our despair we must keep vigil   Over our grieving spirits..... lest we in our lowest depths   Continue to fall....   God is the Way to climbing from the abyss of sorrows

20090307004256AAkuL4D	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this poem?	I haven't seen her in awhile, but we still stay in touch.      She makes me happy, and I cant thank her enough.      As her happiness begins to fade, I can help but want to help.      Why can't I help?      Why are my prayers not working for her?      Why her?      why not me? surley I would trade places if possible.      Because as she begins to break I do too.      I feel her pain, and she feels mine.      We have been like this forever.      and swore to never change,      As her luck begins to shift, I am overwlemed with joy.      Finally my friend will be happy, but to be mistaken was what I was.      She must move again, for her mother health.      She said they are not good in weath there anyway.      I cant belive whats happening.      Why are these prayers not working?      Why cant I help her like she does for me?      Why her?      Oh god please make it be me!      I would do anything for her, everything.      Why cant I, I would sacrafice everything, even myself.      But the problem of that is a secret hidden under blankets of insanity.      We made a promise, a oath, a swear.      If one is to die, than the other is to follow soon after, because heaven would not even be close to our friendship.      Insanity? yes      Foolish? Indeed.      true? Anyday, anytime. Every hour of every breath I take. This will be true.      So if to find a friendship so strong, and a person so great.      why her?
20090306235647AAYK1e6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Your thoughts on this section of my story?	I was sitting on my bed, minding my own business, when Byrdie flew into my room, looking quite like the animal she had been named after. She leapt at me and shoved her pointer finger at my chest.   “How dare you accuse me of stealing my own parent’s money?” she yelled, her eyes shooting daggers at mine. I rolled my eyes, and stepped off my bed.   “Oh, can it Byrd, your parents are gone, you can stop lying,” I said. She snarled at me, and walked slowly towards me.   “You just don’t get it, do you Lucy? This is my house, and my family. If you mess with me ever again, you’ll be out of here so fast, that you’ll get whiplash” she whispered menacingly. I couldn’t help but laugh. So, if I crossed her again, she would give me what I want?  That sounded good to me.   “Look, Byrd: you don’t scare me,” I retorted. She moved so close to me that I could feel her breath on my skin.   “Then you’re a fool” she spat at me, before whirling around and stomping out of my room. I shook my head, and sat back down on my bed.

The adore of your heart, as innocent as it gets,   hold on to your beauty, for from selfishness seeds discontent.         Feed onto thee, my fantasy's manifestation,   born of ravenous lust and fragmented confrontation,   shred from humility, covered from the light,   lay waste forever to the sky's cruel feat of unending fright      From ruby to red,   from the day to the night,   hold on to the squeezer of your heart, the composer of delight,   gaze on in trepidation,   given to us by the mighty before,   hope, love, and salvation,   forever meant for them, your definition eternally thought of as abhor.      Also, can you guess what it's about?

20090307003650AA6pnG9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please comment on my short story.......?	"An Indian Widow"   -------------------------------------            A cloudy Saturday Morning. Its getting late, I need to be there at 9.30am. Its a big function. I need   to prepare my kids at the venue - their dresses, atleast one rehearsal before they perform on stage. Good kids, really innocent, expecting them to perform well. Get ready,get ready fast..            She reaches the venue, wearing the white saree,its an annual function organized by All india association of NGOs (AIAN). People from different branches from all over the country have gathered. She looks simple and beautiful, at 47, she is very pretty and charming and standsout in the crowd. When she walks, most of the men and women glance her, feel her. The innocent 6 orphan kids welcome her, they are from small organization she founded 4 years back - "Jeevan". Although this is small organization, Its affiliated to AIAN now, mainly seeing her dedication to help the orphan kids in need. This being the first gathering against a large audience she wants her kids make use of this opportunity to perform well on stage.          The function starts with inaugural speech and other programs and then comes performance from her group of kids. The most awaited one for her is performance by group of these kids, 3 pairs, dancing for the song "Hum bane Tum bane eek dooje keliye". Each pair filling so much emotion, she could not resist remembering her past. We were also made for each other she feels. I used to love him so much. The days we had spent close to 20 years was fantastic. He was so naughty, used to behave like a kid, we were so happy. Oh god, that tragic accident, I never wanted to live alone, why did you take my hubby,my sweat kids and left me alone on this earth, she cries...well, these kids are making my day, I should be happy..The function ends very well, and representatives appreciate her organization and assure to support in future.         She returns back very happily at home. How good the day was. I was so lonely when I lost everyone in my life. These kids entered into my life, how beautiul it is now. How happy my hubby would be seeing all these. All the money he worked hard and had earned is being utilised for good cause. She remembers how difficult initial few days afte she lost everyone in that tragic accident, it was a shock. She was strong. She determines to do something good to the society, how her husband used to feel that they should help the needy.         With her interest in kids, she determines to help out and grow orphan and physically disabled kids. She contacts hospitals and areas around and finds someone who is in real need and adopts them. That was difficult, to be a lady and be alone and still try to do something good for the society. Most of the people tried to use her, neglected her, made her to feel bad. No one supports when you are down. Everyone appreciates when you are on top, thats the bitter truth she feels. Slowly but steadily she built the platform and envionment for the kids to grow and feel happy. Now for rest of her life she wants to support as many kids as possible and make them reach till some point so that they can lead a happy life.       She goes to bed, thinks of kids calling her amma, amma...hugging her...treating more than mother, she feels so good...she weeps in happiness..and goes to sleep.      Sunday morning 10am...sweaty, get up..its already 10...we should go for shopping, get up... Aan..sweatheart, you !..oh my god, I was dreaming !!

I have had girls in my dance class try to push my legs farther back but nothing seems to be working. I have very long legs so it is even harder. I have even had my dance teacher push me down while i attempted to do it. I have been told it might just be my hips and they are not made to move in that direction. Everytime i do them it feels like my hip bone is being shoved into another bone.(only way i could think to explain it). How do i know if it is just my hips? If not how do i get all the way down in my middle splits? And it i just will never be able to get them what do i do? (Wont that effect my dancing?) I'm a little stressed out because i have been working on it for years and i can to my right and  left splits but not these when everyone else in my class can...any suggestions??

20090308110104AAhpK1v	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Are the "Live at the Met" HD broadcasts really live?	I watched the broadcast of Madama Butterfly this weekend. It was great, but it felt like it wasn't performed in front an audience. And it seemed like it was taped, not performed live. I say that because they showed clips before the opera started, and I'd swear those exact same clips were in the presentation. For example, they showed Pinkerton catching Butterfly and lifting her up. She's a big lady, so in the preview clip he staggered a little to his left and recovered. During the opera, the *exact* same stagger happened.      The other thing that bothers me is that some of the camera angles looked as though they were filmed from the main level, not the balcony. It seems like having all the cameras would have bothered the audience.      On the other hand, though, there were some shots where you can see someone's head pop in front of the camera. Plus, the editing was bad in several places. So maybe it was with a live audience.      Maybe they do a cut-rate deal on the tickets to compensate for having the cameras there?

I was thinking about painting plates as a birthday party activity (but at home, not at a pottery studio like Color Me Mine.) I've been looking at ceramic bisque online, but I was wondering if you could just paint on a white ceramic dinner plate or is ceramic bisque different than a finished plate. Also, do the plates need to be fired to be food safe or is there another way to do it? I read something about using underglaze and a clear overglaze on top of it, but does that still need to be fired or does the overglaze protect you from the underglaze? If it's too much trouble, maybe we'll just paint something that isn't used for food, but I still want to make sure it's non-toxic.       Also, any ideas of the cost of firing ceramics? Where is the best place to do this?

Please comment on what you think I should change, before I draw anymore.   Once I draw the rest of the picture, it's difficult to change stuff on the top- as it gets smudged if I touch the paper (even with a fixitive D:)      Sooooooooooo please someone answer this time *pouty face*      If anything, what should I change in this? And, do you think I should add a background (just a solid shade behind the subject) or leave it  white?   and I have a scanner, so it's not like the picture is difficult to see :(   (why didn't anyone answer the first question....)      drawing (WIP shot 1): http://s265.photobucket.com/albums/ii231...       adn this is the referance picture:    http://s265.photobucket.com/albums/ii231...

I have been reading a book called "The Gulag Archipelago" where the author explains in detail how torture was common and even accepted in the former USSR.       I wonder if the methods of torture became more refined with the advancement of technology!!      What about the CIA? Have they refined their methods of interrogation in order to deal with the so called "terrorist threat?"       Is torture an acceptable practice when the safety of a nation is at risk? Would you torture another human being in order to protect your country?         Thanks a lot for your compassion.
20090227113035AAHOJzf	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Studio Photography vs Event Photography?  *PICS*?	I should just trust my gut, but I'm going to ask anyway.        If someone can do awesome studio or model work, would they make for a good event photographer too?      I am looking for my wedding photographer currently and some of the people who have contacted me have very nice portfolios, but all their work is either in the studio or out on location but posed and set up.  I'm worried that doing the traditional wedding group photos etc will be difficult for them, especially because its an event.  People don't stop and wait 3 hours for the photos to be taken.      Whats your opinion?           Examples of what I've been seeing...(not actually the people's works but stuff similar).  They are very good, but I'm still wondering.       http://kedralynn.deviantart.com/art/Good...     http://bexai.deviantart.com/art/louie-s-...     http://artdibujar.deviantart.com/art/you...     http://azgoth.deviantart.com/art/Purrrrr...     http://muddassir.deviantart.com/art/Stre...     http://loganart.deviantart.com/art/3-mon...

Around 4 years ago i was awarded a scholarship (the scholarship was simply 1 free year of ballet in the same school and everything... but that's not the point) anyway... then around a year after that i was one of the chosen 4 (from the young section) representing the school  in a national show.       The thing is that now I am in grade 7 (in ballet) but I never feel like the lessons and therefore I kind of  slowly started getting worse... and I'm finding it a little lame and stuff :P      The question is should I stop... cos I'm bored of ballet and I'm not good at it anymore. Plus next year i have my O'levels (i don't know if u have them abroad...) and anyway I can always return if I am missing it too much right?      pls help me because by 1st march I have to give in the paper that states weather or not I shall do my grade 7 exam in summer.      Thanks   I appreciate every answer (=
