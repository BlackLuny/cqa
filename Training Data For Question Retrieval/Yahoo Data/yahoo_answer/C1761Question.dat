20090307102532AAKFw5Y	News & Events;Current Events	Do you think this is responsible parenthood, or downright wrong?	 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/articl...       I've just found this article having been linked from another. Now I'm never judge either single parents, or young mothers (being both myself) but this, frankly, shocked me.      I think it's really wrong - I can only imagine the effect it will have on the children when they grow up.       Do you agree with their mother, that as long as they have at least one loving parent, a child will grow up well balanced, or do you think that as they get older, the kids will eventually develop similar issues to those that caused her mother to have them in this way??

20081029032720AADcLyb	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Whats your take on the influence of the media?	I don't know about you, but for myself nowadays with all the ongoings with the media having a "huge" influence on the world, I mean 20 years ago the job. P.R barely existed, but anyway if the media start to try and influence something i.e a film, a celebrity, a certain story. Just in spite I ignore it all, because I hate being just "one of the millions" to be influenced by one editor of the newspaper. anyway, any views on the media welcome...
