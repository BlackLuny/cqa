20080128181716AAfYzdU	Health;Other - Health	Trasplantes: "Más expectativa de vida"?	Un grupo de científicos anunció el descubrimiento de un método para mejorar la expectativa de vida de las personas que se sometan a un trasplante de órgano.       El procedimiento consiste en que el paciente reciba sangre o células de la médula ósea del donante.       Los investigadores estadounidenses aseguran que el tratamiento reduce la necesidad de usar sustancias que afecten al sistema inmunológico -llamadas inmuno-supresores- que ayudan a que el cuerpo acepte nuevos órganos transplantados.       Sin embargo, los inmune-supresores tienen un efecto secundario que provoca que los pacientes sean más vulnerables a las infecciones o a enfermedades como el colesterol, la presión alta e incluso el cáncer.         La idea de evitar la toma de medicamentos atrae tremendamente a los pacientes.       John Scandling, jefe de la investigación       Y es que para evitar el rechazo del órgano trasplantado, éste debe venir de un cuerpo idéntico, por ejemplo de un hermano gemelo. Es por eso que se necesitan los inmune-supresores para ayudar a que el cuerpo del paciente acepte el nuevo órgano.       Los resultados de este estudio aparecen en la revista científica New England Journal of Medicine.       Transfusión       En el primer estudio realizado en la Universidad de Stanford, un hombre que recibió el ri?ón de su hermano estuvo casi dos a?os sin tomar medicamentos inmune-supresores. El paciente recibió tratamientos de irradiación y de anticuerpos.           Miles de personas esperan para recibir un órgano.        Después, este paciente recibió una transfusión de sangre de su propio hermano. éste tratamiento, combinado con los anteriores, creó una clase de célula inmune o "pacificadora", capaz de evitar el rechazo de un órgano trasplantado.       "La idea de evitar la toma de medicamentos atrae tremendamente a los pacientes", asegura el jefe de la investigación, John Scandling.       "De momento, tenemos esperanzas, pero todavía hay mucho que hacer", dijo Scandling.

Si el genio de Quino hubiera creado a Mafalda en la Argentina de hoy, sin duda habría dedicado algunas vi?etas a la obsesión por la figura que tienen las mujeres de ese país.       En Argentina te tomas un café y no hace falta pedir edulcorante, directamente te lo traen, o vas a comprar un buen pullover y el due?o de la tienda te dice "nunca tenemos ropa gruesa porque nuestras clientas se ven gordas".       Tal parece que para estar bella hay que tener hambre, matarse en el gimnasio y por lo visto también pasar frío.       Anorexígenos       Si quitarse kilos de encima resulta demasiado arduo, "para no salir rodando" (expresión que significa estar como un tonel), unas 400.000 argentinas optan por consumir diariamente drogas para quitar el hambre.       Este es el dato arrojado por la ONU en un informe que indica que Argentina es el segundo consumidor mundial de "anorexígenos".        TESTIMONIO         En un examen entré en una crisis nerviosa y se me empezó a dormir toda la cara, tuve una especie de parálisis. Con los anorexígenos bajas 10 kg muy rápido, pero en cuanto los dejas por el efecto rebote subís 20       Inés, paciente de ALUBA          Esta mezcla de anfetaminas, diuréticos, laxantes, hormonas tiroideas y sedantes de gran poder adictivo, puede provocar reacciones violentas, convulsiones, coma y, en casos extremos, la muerte.             Participe: ?tiene obsesión con su figura?   "Tenía cosquilleos por todo el cuerpo y no podía dormir. En un examen entré en una crisis nerviosa y se me empezó a dormir toda la cara, tuve una especie de parálisis", le explicó a BBC Mundo Inés, de 32 a?os, quien consumió anorexígenos durante tres meses.       El aumento de su consumo en países como Argentina es considerado un síntoma más de la excesiva obsesión por la figura que se vive en muchos países de América Latina.       "Edulcorantes en el biberón"          Según la Asociación para la lucha contra la Bulimia y la Anorexia (ALUBA) una de cada 10 adolescentes argentinas sufre alguna patología alimentaria.                Tenemos tratamientos desde los 3 a?os y encontramos casos de mamás preocupadas porque los bebés no engorden       Mabel Bello, presidenta de ALUBA       Sin embargo, la realidad es que no existen estadísticas certeras sobre la incidencia de estas patologías ni en Argentina ni en el resto de Latinoamérica, en parte también porque enfermedades como la bulimia suelen ser muy difíciles de detectar.          Lo que sí se ha observado es que la edad de los pacientes que acuden al centro ya no se limita a la etapa adolescente y que cada vez son más los adultos y los ni?os de corta edad que sufren anorexia o bulimia.       "Nosotros tenemos tratamientos desde los 3 a?os e incluso nos encontramos casos de mamás preocupadas porque los bebés no engorden, que ponen edulcorantes en los biberones", le explicó a BBC Mundo la presidenta de ALUBA, Mabel Bello.       Problema "adulto"       En Espa?a, los llamados trastornos alimentarios son ya más frecuentes en adultos que entre adolescentes, afecta cada vez a ni?os más peque?os y a más hombres, según reveló un reciente informe de la Asociación en Defensa de la Atención a la Anorexia Nerviosa y Bulimia (ADANER).       "El 85% de las personas que atendemos en nuestros centros tienen más de 18 a?os y uno de cada diez pacientes es hombre", le dijo a BBC Mundo María del Carmen González, coordinadora de ADANER.              En Europa se están empezando a impulsar iniciativas para combatir el aumento de casos.    "Si vemos los dibujos animados o las películas observas que el héroe o la heroína es delgada y el gordo es malo y un fracasado. Y entre los adultos el mensaje es el mismo", dijo González.       "Sabemos que en Argentina llevan muchos a?os padeciendo una epidemia, pero México, Colombia, Perú, Chile y Brasil también están sufriendo una explosión de casos y si aquí estamos mal en tratamientos allí están como nosotros hace 15 o 20 a?os".       Según González, enfermedades como la bulimia o la anorexia suele producirse ante distintas situaciones como un fracaso amoroso, la pérdida de un trabajo o la muerte de un ser querido.        http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/ne...

Científicos descubrieron una parte clave de la química que hace que las células cancerígenas sean tan peligrosas.       Creen que ahora podría ser posible interferir en el mecanismo de la célula y detener el crecimiento del tumor.       La Facultad de Medicina de Harvard identificó una enzima que posibilita que las células cancerígenas consuman enormes cantidades de glucosa, la cual necesitan para crecer descontroladamente.       En la revista Nature, los científicos de Harvard describen cómo las células cancerígenas frenan su crecimiento cuando son privadas de la enzima.       Esta enzima, llamada piruvato cinasa, se encuentra de dos formas, pero el equipo de Harvard descubrió que sólo una -la PKM2- posibilita que las células cancerígenas consuman glucosa a una tasa acelerada.       Cuando los investigadores forzaron a las células cancerígenas a cambiar a la otra forma de piruvato cinaza, coartando la producción de PKM2, su crecimiento se detuvo.        http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science...

Los hombres mayores con niveles más bajos de testosterona en la sangre son más proclives a la depresión, sugiere un estudio llevado a cabo por la Universidad de Western Australia y publicado en los Archivos de Psiquiatría General.    La investigación que analizó a 4.000 hombres de más de 70 a?os concluyó que aquellos con los niveles de testosterona más bajos tenían tres veces más posibilidades de padecer depresión.       Para los científicos, la hormona puede llegar a afectar los niveles de sustancias químicas clave en el cerebro.       Investigaciones previas demostraron que las mujeres son más sensibles a la depresión que los hombres hasta los 65 a?os, cuando la diferencia entre los géneros se vuelve menos marcada.       Se sabe que los niveles de testosterona bajan con la edad, pero la variación entre individuos es amplia.
20080307075504AA5WS49	Health;Other - Health	Informacion de la BBC:Los genes de la felicidad?	Un grupo de expertos llegó a la conclusión de que nuestro nivel de felicidad en la vida está fuertemente influido por los genes que tenemos al nacer.       Un estudio de la Universidad de Edimburgo sobre gemelos y mellizos sugiere que los genes podrían controlar la mitad de los rasgos de la personalidad que nos proporcionan felicidad.       La otra mitad está vinculada al estilo de vida, la carrera profesional y las relaciones.       Sin embargo, otro experto se?aló que, a pesar de los hallazgos de la investigación que aparece publicada en la revista especializada Psychological Science, podemos entrenarnos para estar más contentos.       Los sicólogos han desarrollado varios métodos para evualuar el tipo de personalidad de una persona e incluso su nivel de felicidad.       El estudio, hecho conjuntamente con científicos del Instituto de Investigación Médica de Queensland, Australia, analizó los resultados de 900 pares de mellizos.    Según la base de la investigación, debido a que los gemelos idénticos son genéticamente iguales mientras que los mellizos no lo son, es posible comparar los dos grupos para calcular qué grado de inflluencia tiene la genética en un rasgo particular.       En este caso, los investigadores buscaron personas que tenía la tendencia a no preocuparse y que eran sociables y concienzudos.       Estas tres características han sido vinculadas por otra investigación a un sentimiento general de felicidad o bienestar.       Las diferencias entre los resultados entre gemelos y mellizos sugiere que esos rasgos estaban en un 50% influidos por factores genéticos.       Sicología positiva       El doctor Alexander Weiss, catedrático de la Facultad de Filosofía, Sicología e Idiomas de la Universidad de Edimburgo, fue el encargado de la investigación.         La gente tiene una variedad de posibles niveles de felicidad, y es perfectamente factible influir en esto con técnicas cuyo funcionamiento se ha demostrado empíricamente       Dr. Alex Linley, Centro para la Aplicación de la Sicología Positiva        "Conjuntamente con la vida y la libertad, la búsqueda de la felicidad es un deseo humano central", explicó a la BBC.       "Aunque la felicidad está sujeta a un amplio rango de influencias externas hemos encontrado que hay un componente hereditario de felicidad, que se explica totalmente por la aquitectura genética de la personalidad".       La ciencia de la felicidad es un campo de interés creciente que exige, tanto del público como de la industria, comprensión sobre el bienestar emocional.       El Centro para la Aplicación de la Sicología Positiva promueve la investigación de técnicas para impulsar la felicidad personal.       El doctor Alex Linley, de ese centro de estudios, dijo a la BBC que, si bien otros estudios respaldaban el argumento genético, era erróneo pensar que la naturaleza les ha dado a las personas un nivel fijo en términos de felicidad.       "Lo que significa es que, más que un solo punto, la gente tiene una variedad de posibles niveles de felicidad, y es perfectamente factible influir en esto con técnicas cuyo funcionamiento se ha demostrado empíricamente".       "Cosas simples, como elaborar una lista de puntos fuertes y usarlos de distintas formas todos los días o mantener un diario donde en el que uno escribe, cada noche, tres cosas por las cuales uno se siente agradecid, han mostrado que se pueden lograr mejoras".        http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science... 
20080307075626AA0qC0c	Health;Other - Health	Para compartir: ?Por qué nos da gripe con el frío?	?Alguna vez se ha preguntado por qué los seres humanos tendemos a enfermarnos de gripe cuando hace frío?        La capa protectora del virus se derrite para poder infectar a la célula.    Un equipo de científicos en Estados Unidos afirma que ha encontrado la respuesta.       Los investigadores de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud descubrieron que los virus se cubren de un material graso que se endurece como un gel protegiéndolos en el frío.       Este recubrimiento, explican, se derrite en las temperaturas más altas del tracto respiratorio, lo que permite que el virus infecte a las células.       Los científicos esperan que su estudio, publicado en la revista especializada Nature Chemical Biology conduzca a nuevos tratamientos.       "Es una información magnífica y esperamos que se pueda confirmar" dijo a BBC Ciencia el doctor Luis Fidel Avenda?o, del Programa de Virología del Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas de la Universidad de Chile.       "Porque siempre la incógnita ha sido por qué a pesar de la globalización, los viajes y el contacto de la gente del hemisferio norte y sur, el virus de influenza se restringe a ciertas épocas en distintas partes del mundo", agrega el experto.          Protección       Según los investigadores, la resistente capa elástica alrededor del virus que se forma en temperaturas frías le ofrece la protección que se necesita para pasar de persona a persona.       Este recubrimiento es tan robusto que incluso puede resistir ciertos detergentes.           El estudio podría conducir a nuevos tratamientos para la gripe.    Pero una vez dentro del huésped, el virus sólo puede infectar a la célula cuando el recubrimiento se ha derretido.       Este estado líquido no es suficientemente resistente para proteger al virus, de manera que si la capa protectora se derrite cuando el virus está fuera del huésped, éste muere.       Los científicos creen que este hallazgo abrirá nuevas líneas de investigación para combatir los brotes de gripe invernal.       Entendiendo cómo el virus se protege a sí mismo para poder propagarse de persona a persona -se?alan-, se podrá estudiar la forma de interferir con ese mecanismo protector.          "Las epidemias de gripe a menudo ocurren en la época cuando entran los colegios a clase que es cuando hay un mayor contacto y una actividad intensa", afirma el doctor Avenda?o.       "Pero en el verano o períodos de vacaciones no prenden las epidemias, por eso tendemos a echar la culpa al huésped".       "Con este estudio, sin embargo, entendemos que el virus se hace más o menos susceptible al medio ambiente, lo cual es un dato muy importante", agrega el experto.       Temperatura       En el estudio los investigadores utilizaron una sofisticada técnica de resonancia magnética.         Siempre la incógnita ha sido porqué a pesar de la globalización, los viajes y el contacto de la gente del hemisferio norte y sur, el virus de influenza se restringe a ciertas épocas en distintas partes del mundo       Dr. Luis Fidel Avenda?o    Con ésta lograron identificar las características detalladas de la forma como las membranas exteriores del virus responden a las variaciones de temperatura.       Las membrana exterior del virus está compuesta principalmente de moléculas, llamadas lípidos, que son aceites, grasas y colesterol.       Descubrieron que a temperaturas ligeramente sobre el nivel de congelamiento, este recubrimiento lípido se solidifica en un gel.       Sin embargo, a medida que las temperaturas se acercan a los 15,6 grados centígrados, el recubrimiento se derrite gradualmente hasta convertirse en una mezcla líquida espesa.       Los investigadores concluyen que las temperaturas en primavera y verano pueden ser demasiado altas para permitir que la membrana viral entre en este estado gelatinoso.       Como resultado, a estas temperaturas los virus de influenza podrían secarse y debilitarse, lo que resulta en el fin de la temporada de gripe.       "Es una información muy interesante -se?ala el doctor Luis Avenda?o- y si se confirma se podrán tener muchas implicaciones prácticas".       "Por ejemplo, la prevención podría hacerse o planificarse de otro modo, quizás asociando más los programas de prevención de gripe con la temperatura ambiente de los distintos países".
20080304082703AAUZAMa	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Informe para diabeticos:Piel de rana contra la diabetes?	Las secreciones de la piel de una rana sudamericana podrían ser utilizadas para tratar la diabetes tipo 2.        El compuesto ayuda a la rana a protegerse de infecciones.    Se trata de la "rana paradójica", llamada así porque a medida que se desarrolla su tama?o se reduce y el renacuajo es 5 veces más grande que sus padres.       Científicos afirman que un compuesto que se aísla del anfibio, el pseudin-2, podría estimular la liberación de insulina.       Con una versión sintética del compuesto, dicen los científicos, se podrían producir nuevos medicamentos para la diabetes tipo 2.       En los últimos a?os se han realizado muchas investigaciones sobre la actividad biológica de las moléculas de las secreciones de la piel de anfibios y reptiles.       "Hace tiempo se encontró una sustancia en la saliva de un lagarto, llamada exendina" dijo a BBC Ciencia la doctora Adela Rovira, vicepresidenta de la Sociedad Espa?ola de Diabetes y autora del libro "Todo para la diabetes".       La exendina fue descubierta en la saliva del monstruo de Gila, una especie de lagarto que habita en el suroeste de Estados Unidos y norte de México.       "Con la exendina -agrega la investigadora- también se desarrolló un compuesto sintético que actúa liberando insulina".       El estudio, presentado durante la conferencia anual de la organización británica Diabetes UK, fue llevado a cabo por investigadores de las universidades de Ulster y de los Emiratos árabes Unidos.       Insulina       La diabetes tipo 2, que a menudo se asocia a la obesidad y sobrepeso, es causada cuando el organismo no logra producir suficiente insulina o cuando no asimila adecuadamente la insulina que produce.       Esto provoca que la persona no pueda regular apropiadamente sus niveles de glucosa en la sangre.           Los investigadores esperan probar el compuesto en pacientes humanos.    Los investigadores descubrieron que el pseudin-2, que protege a la rana paradójica de las infecciones, lograba estimular la secreción de insulina en células pancreáticas analizadas en el laboratorio.       Y lo más importante, afirman, es que no se produjeron efectos tóxicos en las células.       Además, la versión sintética del pseudin-2 resultó más efectiva para estimular la liberación de insulina que el compuesto natural de la rana.       El pseudin-2 es un péptido -un bloque para la formación de proteínas- que podría servir para el desarrollo de una nueva clase de fármacos contra la diabetes tipo 2 llamados incretinas.          Estos son fármacos que inyectados estimulan la secreción de insulina en pacientes con diabetes tipo 2.
20080304082937AA3gw8S	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Para adelgazar, desayunar : Informe de la BBC?	Los adolescentes que se preocupan por mantenerse delgados, pueden creer que eliminando el desayuno perderán peso. Pero, según indica un estudio, es todo lo contrario.    Una investigación realizada en Estados Unidos sobre los hábitos alimenticios de 2.000 jóvenes durante un periodo de cinco a?os, encontró que aquellos que se saltaban el desayuno pesaban cerca de 2,3 kilogramos más que quienes lo primero que hacían al comenzar el día era comer.       Esto ocurría a pesar del hecho de que quienes desayunaban ingerían más calorías en el curso del día.         Necesitamos dejar en claro que es vital comer con regularidad, y que un desayuno completo es muy importante       Tam Fry   National Obesity Forum    La investigación publicada en la revista Pediatrics, también encontró que quienes tomaban desayuno, se mostraban mucho más activos.       El estudio del equipo de la Universidad de Minnesota agrega peso a un creciente cuerpo de evidencia de que aquellos que toman desayuno -jóvenes o viejos-, son más delgados que quienes no lo hacen.       "Puede parecer ilógico", dijo Mark Pereira, director de la investigación. "Pero, mientras que ellos ingieren más calorías, también hacen más para quemarlas, y esto puede ser porque quienes comen desayuno no se sienten tan aletargados".       "Aunque lo óptimo es comer algo saludable, un cereal integral, por ejemplo, la evidencia parece sugerir que comer cualquier cosa es mejor que no comer nada".       Mensajes mixtos           Quien ingiere más calorías también quema más calorías, y eso explica la reducción de peso.        Cerca del 25% del grupo que se estudió no tomaba desayuno regularmente, y el problema era en particular pronunciado entre las jóvenes.       "No es un problema exclusivo de las ni?as, pero ciertamente es un asunto que afecta mucho más a este grupo", dijo Pereira.       "Ellas se saltan el desayuno porque están preocupadas por el aumento de peso -y es irónico que las que no están preocupadas y comen en la ma?ana son las que bajan de peso".       Tam Fry, director de Child Growth Foundation at the National Obesity Forum, dijo que los hallazgos del estudio mostraban justamente cuán importante era enviar mensajes claros y consistentes a los jóvenes.       "El problema real es la profusión de mensajes acerca de la obesidad; necesitamos dejar en claro que es vital comer con regularidad, y que un desayuno completo es muy importante".           Los jóvenes que toman desayuno se sienten más alegres, más optimistas, más despiertos.    "Si lo primero que usted hace al comienzo del día es comer, se sentirá más alegre, más optimista, más despierto, y eso significa que quemará más energía".       Los adolescentes no son los únicos que se benefician de sentarse a la mesa y tomar un buen desayuno.

Las personas mayores que involuntariamente cabecean durante el día corren un riesgo cuatro veces mayor de sufrir ataques cerebrovasculares, se?ala un nuevo estudio.       Según esta investigación, hecha por científicos estadounidenses, quienes acostumbran dormitar en el día tienen entre dos y cuatro veces más posibilidades de sufrir ataques o derrames cerebrovasculares que quienes no lo cabecean.       Durante una conferencia Internacional sobre ataques cerebrovasculares, el equipo de investigadores recomendó a los médicos supervisar a las personas mayores que cabecean hasta quedarse dormidas frente al televisor.       En el estudio se le preguntó a unas 2.000 personas cuán menudo se quedaban dormidas ante diferentes situaciones.       La lista incluía peque?as siestas frente al televisor, sentados y hablando con alguien, sentados tranquilamente después de un almuerzo sin bebidas alcohólicas y, brevemente, al conducir un auto en medio del tráfico.       El riesgo de ataque en los dos siguientes a?os fue 2,6 mayor en la gente que se dejababa vencer ocasionalmente por el sue?o, en comparación con quienes no lo hacían.       Entre quienes se?alaron que se quedaban dormidos frecuentemente el riesgo fue 4,5 mayor.       Los investigadores también encontraron que aumentó el riesgo de ataque cardíaco o muerte por enfermedad vascular.       "Son cifras significativas", dijo la doctora Bernadette Boden-Albala, profesora asistente de neurología en la Universidad de Columbia, Nueva York, y encargada del estudio.       "Nos sorprendió que el impacto fuese tan grande para un período tan corto", aseveró.       Mal sue?o       Investigaciones previas mostraron que quienes sufren de apnea del sue?o -cese de la respiración mientras se duerme- tienen una posibilidad mayor de ataque cerebrovascular.           Quedarse dormido de día frente al televisor podría ser da?ino para la salud.       Podría ser que los cabeceos involuntarios de día sean una se?al de mal sue?o en la noche debido a la apnea.       "Con lo que sabemos ahora, vale la pena evaluar a los pacientes que tienen problemas para dormir", dijo la doctora Bodem-Albala.       El doctor Heinrich Audebert, especialista en ataques cardiovasculares del Hospital St. Thomas, de Londres, encontró lógicos los resultados.       "La apnea del sue?o es un factor de riesgo para ataques cardiovasculares y en los países mediterráneos la siesta está asociada con un leve aumento del riesgo de ataques", dijo.       Agregó Audebert que los pacientes que tenían apnea del sue?o mostraban subidas de presión durante la noche.       Otra causa potencial para las conclusiones del estudio podrían ser leves ataques cardiovasculares no diagnosticados que provocan da?os en el cerebro y y le dan más sue?o a la persona durante el día, a?adió.
20080229080635AA9j89O	Health;Mental Health	No es una pregunta, es un informe para compartir en yahoo respuestas: Los antidepresivos, "poco efectivos"	La nueva generación de antidepresivos, que usan millones de personas en todo el mundo, tiene pocos beneficios clínicos en la mayoría de los pacientes, se?ala una nueva investigación.       Un equipo de investigadores británicos, estadounidenses y canadienses concluyó que los fármacos son de ayudan solamente para un peque?o grupo de personas con la depresión más severa.       La investigación -conducida en la Universidad de Hull, Inglaterra y publicada en la revista PLoS Medicine- se?ala que la mayoría de las personas que sufren de depresión pueden recuperarse sin la ayuda de drogas.    Robert Walker, periodista de la BBC, explicó que los investigadores obtuvieron muchos datos apelando a las leyes de libertad de infomación de EE.UU. Allí se incluye información de resultados de experimentos clínicos que las compa?ías de medicamentos decidieron no publicar en su momento.       Majorie Wallace, director del centro de salud mental Sane en el Reino Unido, dijo que si estos resultados se confirman, podrían ser muy "perturbadores".       Defensa        Nombres comerciales de antidepresivos en América Latina    Prozac   Adofen   Reneuron   Foxetin   Fluoxac   Ansilan   Neupax   Zepax   Paxil   Aropax   Motivan   Frosinor   Seroxat   Sertralina   Zoloft   Aremis   Besitran   Atruline   Lustral   Citalopram   Celexa   Seropram   Prisdal    Pero los laboratorios que producen Prozac y Seroxat, dos de los más comunes antidepresivos, dijeron que no están de acuerdo con los hallazgos.       Un vocero de GlaxoSmithKline, fabricante de Seroxat, dijo que el estudio observa sólo "un peque?o subconjunto de toda la información disponible".       La casa farmacéutica Eli Lilly, encargada de la producción de Prozac, dijo que "una extensa experiencia científica y médica ha demostrado que (Prozac) es un antidepresivo efectivo".       En total, el equipo de investigadores de Hull, que publicó el estudio en la revista especializada PLoS Medicine, revisó la información de 47 pruebas clínicas.       Los especialistas analizaron tanto la información clínica hecha pública por los laboratorios como la protegida por la Legislación de Libertad de Información.       Los expertos se enfocaron en medicamentos conocidos como Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptación de Serotonina (SSRI, por sus siglas en inglés), los cuales funcionan controlando los niveles de serotonina en el cerebro.       Entre ese tipo de medicamentos, se encuentra la fluoxetina (Prozac), la venlafaxina (Efexor), y paroxetina (Seroxat).       Alternativas       Los investigadores hallaron que incluso los efectos positivos vistos en pacientes severamente deprimidos eran relativamente peque?os y abiertos a interpretación.         Dados estos resultados, hay pocas razones para prescribir antidepresivos, con excepción de los pacientes con depresiones severas, a no ser que los tratamientos alternativos no funcionen       Irving Kirsch, director de la investigación       De acuerdo con la investigación, los efectos aparentemente positivos de los antidepresivos en los pacientes con depresión severa no se debía al fármaco en sí, sino a que los pacientes respondían menos a los placebos que se les suministró durante las pruebas.       El director de la investigación, Irving Kirsch, dijo: "La diferencia en la mejoría entre pacientes que tomaron placebos en las pruebas clínicas y los que tomaron antidepresivos no es muy grande".       "Esto significa que la gente deprimida puede mejorar sin tratamientos químicos", dijo el especialista.       "Dados estos resultados, hay pocas razones para prescribir antidepresivos, con excepción de los pacientes con depresiones severas, a no ser que los tratamientos alternativos no funcionen".       El profesor Kirsch dijo que los hallazgos también cuestionan el actual sistema de reportar las pruebas de medicamentos.       Severas y no severas           Tras la investigación, se cuestiona el tipo de información que publican los laboratorios sobre las pruebas de sus medicamentos.    La editora académica de la investigación, la profesora Philipa Hay, de la Universidad de Sydney Occidental, le dijo a la BBC que los antidepresivos en realidad no ayudan a las personas con depresiones que no son severas.       "Hubo un efecto, pero si se compara con el que tuvo el insumo de un placebo o una tableta de azúcar en personas con formas menos intensas de depresión, no hay mucho que destacar", dijo Hay.       "La gente con depresión severa, la cual tiene un impacto trascendental en su forma de disfrutar y de participar en la vida, esas personas que tienen muchos problemas para levantarse en las ma?anas o que dejan de comer o de beber, esos pacientes sí recibieron un poderoso efecto de los antidepresivos más que de los placebos", dijo la doctora.       Revisión       El doctor Tim Kendall, subdirector de la unidad de investigación del Royal Collage, de Inglaterra, dijo que con el estudio se puede concluir que los laboratorios tienden sólo a dar a conocer los estudios en los que sus productos muestran sus bondades.       De acuerdo con Kendall, los hallazgos de la Universidad de Hull socavan la confianza en la capacidad de dar conclusiones sobre los méritos de los medicamentos si se toma en cuenta la publicación de sólo cierta información.       El especialista hizo un llamado para que los laboratorios sean forzados a publicar toda la información recogida en las pruebas.       Sólo en el Reino Unido, el número de prescripciones de antidepresivos ha aumentado en los últimos a?os, pese a que su organismo de salud, el NHS (National Health System), tiene como principio que los antidepresivos no deben ser usados como un tratamiento inicial en personas quienes presentan síntomas de depresión moderada.       Según la corresponsal de la BBC para asuntos de salud, Jane Dreaper, en 2007 hubo 16 millones de prescripciones de la nueva generación de antidepresivos.
20080229081013AAccr7a	Health;Other - Health	Tuberculosis causa alarma : Informe de la BBC?	Los casos de tuberculosis resistente a tratamientos farmacológicos (MRD - TB) han llegado a los niveles más altos conocidos hasta ahora, advirtió la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS).       Cada a?o se registran nueve millones de nuevos casos. De esa cifra, en 2006, casi dos millones fueron fatales, dice un estudio elaborado sobre datos recogidos en 81 países entre 2002 y 2006.    El informe también destaca la aparición de unos 40.000 casos anuales de otro tipo de tuberculosis resistente a todos los medicamentos considerados efectivos (XDR-TB) registrada en 45 países.       "Se necesita un ataque frontal, de lo contrario perderemos la batalla", dijo el doctor Mario Raviglione, director del departamento Detengamos la Tuberculosis de la OMS.       La paradoja de Perú        Paul Nunn         Estamos ante una epidemia global y los casos de resistencia a los medicamentes hacen que las posibilidades de cura se reduzcan dramáticamente, porque el tratamiento estándar no funciona       Organización Mundial de la Salud    Desde Ginebra, sede de ese organismo de Naciones Unidas, la corresponsal de la BBC, Imogen Foulkes, destaca que las cifras podrían ser aún mayores de las que aparecen en el estudio.       En efecto, en muchas regiones de áfrica no se cuenta con instrumentos de diagnóstico para la enfermedad y sólo seis estados de ese continente proporcionaron estadísticas.       De todos modos, los expertos de la OMS comprobaron que el mayor número de casos de MDR-TB está en China, pero también observan con preocupación los altos niveles en los países de la antigua Unión Soviética.       Un caso particular es el de Corea del Sur y Perú, donde el aumento de este tipo de tuberculosis se produce al mismo tiempo que la prevalencia de la enfermedad en general ha disminuido.       El coordinador de Detengamos la Tuberculosis, Paul Nunn, dijo que el país latinoamericano "es un ejemplo en el control de la tuberculosis en términos de diagnóstico y tratamiento", pero no en cuanto "a su capacidad de diagnosticar casos de MDR-TB.       Sida y pobreza       Durante la presentación del informe en Ginebra, la Organización Mundial de la Salud hizo un llamado para reunir US$5.000 millones destinados a expandir los programas de diagnósticos.       Según los expertos, de este modo se pueden iniciar rápidamente los tratamientos que a su vez deben ser cumplidos hasta el final a fin de prevenir el desarrollo de resistencia a los medicamentos.       Como indica la corresponsal de la BBC en Ginebra, Imogen Foulkes, el llamado de la OMS pone en evidencia que, contrario a lo que mucha gente cree, la tuberculosis no es "una amenaza menor o una epidemia del siglo XIX, sino que nunca se fue del mundo en desarrollo".       En efecto, el estudio del organismo de la ONU destaca la estrecha relación entre pobreza y tuberculosis, al tiempo que confirma la relación entre la MRD-TB y el VIH, el virus causante del Sida.           http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science... 
20080229081241AAz7oft	Health;Other - Health	Argentina: fiebre amarilla preocupa ....Informe no es pregunta?	Entre el alarmismo y la prevención, miles de personas acuden diariamente a centros sanitarios de toda Argentina para vacunarse contra la fiebre amarilla, luego de que se registrara un brote de la enfermedad en los vecinos Brasil y Paraguay.              Miles de personas acuden a los centros de vacunación.    En Buenos Aires, tanto los porte?os como los miembros de la numerosa comunidad paraguaya forman largas filas en siete unidades de vacunación para aplicarse gratuitamente la inmunización.       Son aquéllos que viven en zonas de riesgo o planean viajar a ellas. Nos referimos no sólo a Paraguay y Brasil, sino también a provincias del noreste de Argentina como Misiones y Formosa, que son limítrofes con esos países.       En la fila de varias cuadras que suele formarse ante la Dirección de Sanidad de Fronteras, el principal centro de vacunación de Buenos Aires, el porte?o Roberto Santos, de 58 a?os, dijo a BBC Mundo que llevaba varias horas esperando para inmunizarse antes de volar a territorio brasile?o.       Por su parte, la paraguaya Natividad López (38) nos contó: "Estoy haciendo esta cola porque acá, en Argentina, la vacuna está más accesible. En mi país es difícil conseguirla".       Hasta la fecha, el gobierno de Paraguay ha confirmado 15 casos de fiebre amarilla y tres muertes por esa enfermedad, mientras que en Brasil se han reportado 33 infectados y 17 fallecimientos.       En ambos países la afección ha sido detectada en zonas rurales y selváticas, y las autoridades intentan frenar su llegada a las ciudades.       Hace cuatro décadas que en América Latina no existe la variante urbana de la fiebre amarilla.       "Cordón sanitario"       Mientras tanto, el gobierno argentino lleva adelante una campa?a para prevenir un brote como el que afecta a las naciones vecinas.             Lo que deben tener en claro es que, si están en Buenos Aires o en cualquier sitio fuera de las zonas de riesgo y no tienen programados viajes, no necesitan vacunarse       Hugo Fernández, director nacional de Enfermedades y Riesgos del Ministerio de Salud       "Hemos distribuido más de 400.000 dosis de vacunas para aplicar a las personas que residen en zonas de riesgo y a quienes se disponen a viajar a esas áreas. Esto nos permite establecer un cordón sanitario", explicó a BBC Mundo Hugo Fernández, director nacional de Enfermedades y Riesgos del Ministerio de Salud.       Además, dijo, se ha impulsado la erradicación de aguas estancadas donde se reproducen los mosquitos que transmiten la enfermedad.       Ante este panorama, ?se justifica tanta preocupación entre la población de Argentina, donde el único caso sospechado de fiebre amarilla ha sido descartado?       Fernández cree que no: "Lo que deben tener en claro es que, si están en Buenos Aires o en cualquier sitio fuera de las zonas de riesgo y no tienen programados viajes, no necesitan vacunarse".       "También hay que dejar en claro que no hay transmisión de persona a persona en el caso de la fiebre amarilla. Tiene que haber un ecosistema particular para que ello ocurra".       La enfermedad es provocada por un virus que se transmite por la picadura del mosquito Aedes aegypti en las áreas urbanas y del haemagogus en la selva.       "Su rasgo distintivo es la fiebre y puede tener un espectro de síntomas que van desde dolores de cabeza y musculares hasta una enfermedad tóxica que afecta al hígado y que en algunos casos puede llevar a la muerte", agregó Fernández.       Fantasmas del pasado       La proximidad de los brotes de fiebre amarilla en Paraguay y Brasil no sólo ha despertado temores entre los argentinos, sino también malos recuerdos.             En Argentina, la vacuna está más accesible. En mi país (Paraguay) es difícil conseguirla       Natividad López       Es que en 1871 Buenos Aires sufrió una epidemia que en seis meses se cobró la vida de 14.000 personas sobre una población de alrededor de 200.000 habitantes.       En aquel momento la ciudad avanzaba hacia una mayor urbanización, y el hacinamiento y la falta de higiene contribuyeron a que los mosquitos transmisores de la fiebre amarilla se reprodujeran y contagiaran la enfermedad.       Dato histórico aparte, los miedos actuales van acompa?ados en algunos casos de desconocimiento sobre la afección.       "No sé qué es la fiebre amarilla, pero dicen que es grave", confesó a BBC Mundo la ya citada Natividad López, poco antes de entrar a la sede de la Dirección de Sanidad de Fronteras.       A su lado, Elsa Ledesma (69), oriunda de la provincia de Misiones, afirmó: "Qué es exactamente, no sé. Pero escuché que mata y por eso hay que vacunarse".       Sin embargo, más allá del temor generado por la cercanía de países con fiebre amarilla y los fantasmas del pasado, las autoridades y los especialistas han descartado un brote como el de Paraguay y Brasil, y mucho menos una epidemia como la que sufrió Buenos Aires en el siglo XIX.       Para ellos, calma y racionalidad son también buenas medicinas en estos tiempos.        http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science... 
20080301122937AAYaILO	Health;Other - Health	Sabias que?:Cáncer y vitamina E, ?otro mito? (informe para compartir)?	La ingesta de altas dosis de vitamina E incrementa el riesgo de contraer cáncer de pulmón, especialmente entre los fumadores, advierte un estudio publicado en Estados Unidos.       Investigadores de la Universidad de Washington, en Seattle, evaluaron en un período de cuatro a?os a 77.000 consumidores de complejos vitamínicos cuyas edades oscilan entre 50 y 76 a?os.       Determinaron que, mientras el consumo de ácido fólico y vitamina C no logra reducir la probabilidad de contraer la enfermedad, por el contrario, la ingesta de 400 miligramos diarios de vitamina E en un período prolongado la aumenta en un 28%.       El estudio, dirigido por el doctor Christopher Slatore, será publicado en la edición de febrero de la Revista Americana de Medicina Respiratoria y Cuidados Críticos de la Sociedad Torácica de Estados Unidos.          "Efectos tóxicos"         En contraste con lo que a menudo se asume como beneficioso, o por lo menos carente de efectos nocivos, la vitamina E como suplemento alimentario estuvo asociada con un peque?o incremento del riesgo a desarrollar cáncer de pulmón       Dr. Christopher G. Slatore, Universidad de Washington    La vitamina E se encuentra entre los llamados "antioxidantes" que protegen a las células del impacto da?ino de moléculas conocidas como radicales libres.       Pero la investigación da a entender que, en altas dosis, el efecto sería totalmente a la inversa, o sea que actuaría como un "pro-oxidante", da?ando las células.       "Nuestros resultados deberían alertar a los médicos a aconsejar a sus pacientes que estos suplementos difícilmente puedan reducir el riesgo de cáncer de pulmón e incluso pueden ser perjudiciales", dijo el doctor Slatore.       Según el doctor Tim Byers, de la Universidad de Colorado, mucha gente recurre a los suplementos vitamínicos con la idea de que son saludables o inocuos creyendo que una píldora "imitará los beneficios de una dieta saludable".       Dieta y humo           La mejor prevención contra el cáncer es decir adiós al cigarrillo.    Para este profesional, lo que sí ayudaría a reducir el riesgo de cáncer sería una dieta equilibrada con un amplio componente de nutrientes y minerales como por ejemplo frutas frescas y vegetales.       Por su parte, Henry Scowcroft de la fundación británica Cancer Research, coincidió en la necesidad de una alimentación saludable, aunque destacó que los estudios sobre los suplementos vitamínicos todavía son contradictorios.       De todos modos, insistió en que la mejor manera de evitar muchos tipos de cáncer "es dejar de fumar. No hay dieta ni suplemento vitamínico que pueda contrarrestar los efectos tóxicos del cigarrillo", expresó.       La investigación del doctor Slatore de la Universidad de Washington concuerda en cierto modo con un estudio realizado en Finlandia en 2002.       Este trabajo, que evaluó a 29.000 hombres fumadores que tomaban beta-caroteno (que se convierte luego en vitamina A en el organismo), determinó que esto incrementaba en un 18% el riesgo de desarrollar cáncer de pulmón.        http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science... 
20080302111026AASbimW	Health;Other - Health	Articulo de la BBC...no es pregunta:Vinculan los ronquidos con el corazón?	Un estudio médico reveló que existe un estrecho vínculo entre los ronquidos sonoros y las enfermedades del corazón y las apoplejías.    Un grupo de científicos de Hungría entrevistó a más de 12.000 pacientes y concluyó que las personas que roncan mucho registraron más vulnerabilidad a sufrir ataques cardíacos o apoplejías si se comparan con el resto de la población.       La nueva investigación, publicada en la revista especializada Journal Sleep, resaltó las teorías que ya han vinculado los ronquidos con enfermedades cardiovasculares.       Todos, en algún momento de nuestras vidas, hemos roncado, lo cual se torna más común en personas con sobrepeso.       Alrededor de 40% de los hombres y 24% de las mujeres son "roncadores habituales".       Por a?os, los científicos han advertido sobre la relación entre roncar y las enfermedades cardiovasculares como los ataques al corazón y las apoplejías.       Esta nueva investigación húngara refuerza la teoría.           Durante a?os se han dado a conocer teorías que vinculan los ronquidos con las dolencias cardíacas.    Aumento del riesgo       Más de 12.000 personas fueron entrevistadas en sus hogares sobre sus ronquidos.       Comparados con el resto de la población, los roncadores "ruidosos" registraron 34% más posibilidades de sufrir un ataque cardíaco, mientras que sus riesgos de ser víctimas de una apoplejía fueron de 67%.       Los científicos dijeron que los ronquidos ruidosos con pausas en la respiración podrían ser elementos usados para identificar personas con riesgo de padecer enfermedades cardiovasculares.       La información recabada destaca el hecho de que quien ronca silenciosamente no incrementa su riesgo de manifestar dolencias relacionadas con el corazón.       Sin embargo, no todo son malas noticias para los hombres que roncan, pues se descubrió que la tendencia de roncar se reduce una vez se atraviesa la barrera de los 70 a?os.           http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science...

20080326185242AAPt6Pv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	INFORME PARA DIABETICOS: Vitamina D contra la diabetes 1?	Los suplementos de vitamina D podrían reducir en los ni?os los riesgos de desarrollar diabetes tipo 1.        La diabetes tipo 1 comienza en las primeras etapas de la infancia.    Según un equipo de investigadores británicos, los ni?os que han tomado estos suplementos mostraron 30% menos riesgo de desarrollar la enfermedad.       La diabetes tipo 1 es un trastorno que se desarrolla cuando el sistema inmune destruye las células pancreáticas, encargadas de producir la hormona insulina.          eL INFORME COMPLETO ESTA EN ESTA PAGINA:    http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science... 
20080326190018AAUfqpx	Health;Diet & Fitness	Dieta vegetariana contra artritis?	ES UN INFORME, ESPERO QUE LES INTERESE: EN ESTA PAGINA ESTA COMPLETO EL INFORME.    http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/science...       Los pacientes con artritis reumatoidea podrían reducir su alto riesgo de infartos con una dieta estrictamente vegetariana y libre de gluten, afirma un estudio.        La dieta vegetariana logró disminuir el colesterol "malo".    Los infartos al miocardio y accidentes cerebrovasculares están entre las principales causas de muerte de los pacientes de artritis.       Esto se debe a la inflamación causada por el impacto de la enfermedad en las arterias.       Pero según un nuevo estudio, los pacientes que siguen una dieta estrictamente vegetariana tienen menores niveles de lipoproteína de baja densidad (LDL) o colesterol "malo".       Al bloquear las arterias, el LDL es visto como un factor de riesgo de problemas cardiovasculares.          Los investigadores del Instituto Karolinska, en Estocolmo, afirman además que otro de los beneficios de la dieta vegetariana es que eleva los niveles de anticuerpos naturales en el organismo.       Estos pueden actuar contra las sustancias da?inas que causan los síntomas inflamatorios de la artritis reumatoidea, como la fosforilcolina.       Otros expertos afirman sin embargo, que aunque este tipo de dieta podría reducir el LDL, los pacientes quizás no logren obtener con ella suficientes nutrientes.       "Es natural que con una dieta vegetariana bajen los niveles de todo lo que es grasa, sobre todo colesterol y fundamentalmente el LDL" dijo a BBC Ciencia el doctor Alfredo Arturi, presidente de la Sociedad Argentina de Reumatología.
20080326184735AA3EKTu	Health;Other - Health	Informe de la BBC:La contaminación "afecta" al cerebro?	Si usted respira el humo que despiden los autos durante una hora quizás no sólo sufra un dolor de cabeza.        Las emisiones de los autos causan una respuesta de estrés en el cerebro.    Una investigación reciente asegura que aún una peque?a exposición a los gases emanados por el combustible puede afectar la forma como funciona el cerebro.       Según el estudio publicado en la revista Particle and Fibre Toxicology (Toxicología de Partículas y Fibras), el humo de combustión del diesel induce una respuesta de estrés en la actividad cerebral.       Investigaciones anteriores habían determinado que las peque?as partículas (llamadas nanopartículas) que respiramos en el aire contaminado pueden llegar al cerebro.       Sin embargo, ésta es la primera vez que se logra demostrar en un estudio que la inhalación de contaminantes puede alterar la actividad cerebral.

20080330102507AA1iXzT	Health;Diet & Fitness	What exercises can i do that will make me more stronger, but not lose weight?	I'm a 15 year old female,i'm 5'0, and i weigh 110 lbs.I want to gain more muscle mass in my arms and legs.My arms are skinny and I want them to get stronger and more cut.I want my legs the same way because next year i'm going to start back running track and I want my legs to be good and strong so I can be faster. I dont want to bulky or nothing, I just want tone and definition. Right now i'm currently going to the gym once a week( i know i'm suppose to go more than that) but i can't do it because i have school and i don't have time after school. When I go to the gym I run  on the treadmill for about 1hr and 30 mins and lift weights for every part of my body except my chest and shoulders. So, my question is what exercises can I do that will make my stronger, faster, and build up my endurance and body form WITHOUT losing weight??All answers/ suggestions are greatly appreciated.Thanks!!

20080326070008AAwJEWk	Health;Women's Health	Is ovulation necessary?	I saw my doc the other day about a painful ovarian cyst I have that showed up on a hip MRI I recently had.  He said to take Motrin and that our bodies as women aren't made to ovulate every month.  That we are meant to be pregnant nearly all of our child-bearing years (I guess harkening back to the days when women married, had kids, and died much sooner).  Has anyone else heard this before?

20081001181920AAXoN6T	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	I am getting painful, red welts. HELP?	Starting early this morning I started getting painful red welts. It looks like a mosquito bite about 5 times the size of a normal one. I've got one on my foot, and now my knee feels like I've bruised it and it hurts so badly I can hardly walk. I have a place on the back of my head that feels like I've banged it really hard on something and it's so sore I can't lay on my back. Both of my feet, my knee and the back of my head hurt very badly for no reason. I have been itching for the past 3-4 days. My head and my whole body. And about an hour ago I got another 'welt' on the palm of my hand and it's itchy and hurts. I'm not using/doing anything different. Any ideas what this could be?
20081013174248AAUzuno	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	What did I do to my ankle, is it broken?	I got kicked in the back/ outside part of my foot earlier playing soccer. i heard a pop, and i fell down and it hurt pretty bad. the main part is right above my ankle on the outside, and its about the size of a golf ball, and swoolen about 3 inches long. I can wiggle my toes, and  it isn't a compound fracture, but thats all i know. I can't put pressure on it much, or take a step. it also hurts to move my foot around. I can't go to the doctors, and I'm only 15 and my family is broke. Should I try stretching it or rest it? I have crutches, should I use them, and for how  long? I should go to school tomorrow, so I have to walk some way. Thanks a lot.

Ciao,   Ho 16 anni..   2 mesi fa, per la prima volta ho giocato una schedina, la ho presa da questo sito si pronostici  http://www.helpscommesse.altervista.org  e la ho giocata puntando 3€. ne ho vinti 66!   Visto ke era andata bene, la settimana successiva, ho riseguito i consigli del sito... Ma puntando 5€. ho rivinto! 50€.   Ho preso 50€, le ho fatti mettere nella postepay da un mio amico maggiorenne, e ho aperto un conto scommesse online.. Sempre grazie a quel sito di pronostici, giocando le scommese sul tennis, vinco sempre... anke se poco a poco (20-30€) ma sempre!!! Comunque oltre ai consigli del sito faccio anche schedine di testa mia puntando 10-15€ a schedina, e senza vincere mai.. per fortuna con il tennis ammortizzo le spese.   Da quando gioco, non esco più con i miei amici, sto sempre davanti il pc a guardare le quote etc.. Ero deciso a non giocare più, ma non ci sn riuscito per neanche 2 ore!! Ora nn so più cosa fare.. sto collegato di nascosto fino alle 2 di notte...

Right now I am 215 pounds and considered obese, I am 5' 6.5".      Now let me get something out of the way, I HAVE tried, I AM trying. People think over weight people don't try, well I DO. I've tried hypnosis (NO), jenny craig (NO), quick diets (NO), a very expensive weight loss camp (NO), sand just plain working out or swimming at my pool (<-- This works...but theres a problem:)      See, the problem with the gym is that I'll start strong and because of will power I'll slowly go less and less until I'm not going anymore for a while, then I'll restart, each time going less and less.      My body's weight is distributed kinda oddly. My face is a bit chubby and my legs and arms are okay but I carry most of the weight around my stomach, thus I have "man-breasts" or **** as the a**holes at school like to tease.      Could someone please help me? I'm literally falling apart as the months go by =*(

My husband is a wonderful man who is very supportive and very loving but he lies to me about financial problems all the time.  He has seen how upset this makes me because I am afraid of ruining my great credit that I earned before we met,  but he still makes the same mistakes over and over. He had promised me before we got married he would never do this.   I have talked with him many times, I've been extremely upset and also have been calm and just concerned.   I am now going to take over all the bill paying, but I'm not happy about that because I already have to handle so much in the household already.  He says he will help more around the house but he has trouble keeping up with the things he already has to do. Also, I recently found out my 13 year old son is stealing from me.  I am a very good mom and wife and take care of my family and there well being.  I wish they would care about what they are putting me through.  I got upset with them about the situations and they just stared at me, no one tries to say sorry or take responsibility for their actions.  I was on zoloft for depression once before and gained 60 lbs that I am still trying to lose 5 years later.  I feel hopeless.  I have to work for the next 6 days and I've been crying for 4 hours and I'm exhausted.  I do not have sick time and can't afford to take time off.  What can I do to get through this depression?

Both left and right eye presriptions are similar.   He's been using progressive lenses for 8+ yrs now.      Going for an eye exam he wanted to get new glasses.   The new prescription increased his distance to about +2.75 for both eyes.   Trying out the new prescription on a new frame, his far distance sight (>100ft)  is now blurred. He can no longer drive safely.      The optometrist doesn't seem to know what's wrong. The new lenses checks out ok exactly like prescribed and using the new pair of glasses, my dad gets 20/30 on the eye exam, but far distance vision for 100+ feet is still very blurry.      Using his old glasses (+1.75 far distance) is better than the new glasses (+2.75 far distance), but medium distance (2-3 ft) is better with the new glasses.      What to do? Advice?

20081110140802AAWliMn	Health;Mental Health	How do I cope with all this?	I was single for 2 years and during that time, whenever i liked someone and went for it they wud always be spoken for or lead me on and drift off. I decided to sit back and wait for them to come to me. Ended up being very depressed and crying all the time. And seeing couples happy and kissing each other whenever I was in town just made me worse. After 1 year of crying myself to sleep and being depressed a girl messaged me telling me she liked me. I thought it was another load of rubbish telling me what i wanted to hear. She arranged to meet I said ok but never really thought she would turn up since a lot have always stood me up. But she did and she was real ugly but i decided to give her a chance and her personality shone through. She treated me better than any girl ever did. Then she went and dumped me because she reckons she will be far too busy to see me. 2 days later another girl messages me wanting to meet. I meet her and since i asked her how 2 weeks ago ive never seen her since and she only stays in touch online. She said when she eventually has the time to see me she wants to only kiss me on the cheek and do nothing else whatsoever with me. Ive decided to forget her and try getting someone else. Everyone i try with is taken and just makes fun of me. Im just as depressed as i was before now and gone back to crying. Im really considering getting anti-depressants. What shud i do? Noone make fun please ive had that constantly already.

20090227172705AAC2oEv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Serious: MRSA causing sores or gone?	Back in December I was treated for abscesses in the armpit, they were drained and packed. It was determined I had MRSA in them via a culture test. I was prescribed antibiotics and took them all. I never followed up with the general surgeon as instructed by the ER (I know dummy me) now it's February -- I have two new abscesses in the same armpit. and I have been getting small painful sores on different parts of my body (forearms, sides of torso, even one near my temple). The sores look like blisters, come to a head, but none have ruptured. I have about 6-8 of these blister type things all together. What are they? Does this indicate my MRSA is worse? Is MRSA causing the sores or something else entirely? I can't get into see my doctor until Mid-March plus I don't have health insurance. I am still asking for medical opinions on here until then because I'm worried. Thanks.

I am not complaining...      I am 17 ( soon 18 ) , I have moved a bunch of times, changed schools 8 times. At the age of 14 or around that ( I found out all ages club ) and I am addicted to going there. Al thought for the fact that I move a lot...from time to time I cant go ( not too many ppl like going on a weekly basis :P ). I make friends easily, I am a funny guy. Never had something serious with a girl ( the club thing...) and I dont really want to. I grew up in South America till the age of 12 then moved to North America and moved around a bit till we ( parents and brother ) bought a house...and I never really lived in the "good part" of town lol...While my parents provided all that I need it ( I still feel that I was deprived of certain things...that occur when you move a lot and are not rich ). As a result of moving I can speak 3 languages...   I am a cool guy...but I feel angry ( like inside...you know like sad mixed with anger ) I don't show it ( I have become really good at not feeling anything ). Like when I talk to people I use to know and they tell me how they are still hanging out with the same friends.. I feel sad and angry..Like " why not me? "   Next year I am hoping to go into university for physics ( so I am smart guy as well ) but right now I am living in this area "high middle class" and well when this kids they get 80's or marks like that...their parents give them prizes and **** like that ( cars... ).... I know not a lot of people get cars but still it makes me feel pissed as hell. When I do great in school..my parents tell me "good job"   while I do appreciate the fact that I have parents ( because I am lucky just because of that ) I still wonder why not me? how come I cant get a 09 car when I do well in school ? how come I have had to make new friends every year?   why dont I really care for ppl except my family?   why am I so angry and sad inside yet I am normal on the outside?   Why do I like girls that I meet at clubs more than girls that I meet at school and such?

Most of the time, I have trouble getting to sleep and sleeping all the way through the night. About 65% of the time, I end up laying in bed for one to two hours until I finally get to sleep. I usually toss and turn during the night and wake up around every 2-4 hours...but it all depends on the night. When I stay up past one or two am, I usually don't wake up in the night but I do wake up earlier in the morning around nine to ten am and can't get back to sleep.       Why can't I get to sleep at night?   What's causing me to wake up in the middle of the night all the time? Is there anything that will help me sleep better?

20090227170633AAVGw9n	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Chantix- ever get stuck in nightmares and can't wake yourself?	Example: here's my story. What are yours?   The first time I couldn't wake up was the other day when I turned off my alarm clock in my sleep, and kinda knew I had to get up, woke up while dreaming, tried to move my arm, and couldn't get up. My honey finally woke me up so I could get to my new job on the second day. Whew!   Then, I got stuck in 6 different dreams, some scarier than others, and I tried everything in my dreams to wake up and only did after hte 6th.   I could feel my body in bed.   I could hear my honey breathing next to me.    I tried to follow those feelings to escape the nightmares, but I was trapped.   I only woke up when I looked for my honey, whom I coudl hear breathing, by looking under a comforter in my dream, and finding a really petite dead woman with black eyes   but she looked more like a cheap plastic doll with her too-stiff arms and legs, and then her legs had on knee socks made of gauze wrapped around liek she was in a hospital.   Well, I was teaching a health lesson in ESL (Eng as 2nd Lang) the night before, so that could explain the balck eyes and gauze, but it was so gross, and so not my man,   that I finally esacped 6 dreams of torture.   The first time I got scared in the dream, I had backed up in the dream, closed my eyes, and screamed "Wake up!" over and over at the top of my lungs, but could not get out.   Anyone else get stuck like that?

I'm 18 and go to Sixth Form and i have been told by doctors that i suffer from depression but have not been given any support for it and i just feel like i need to talk to someone other than my parents and friends about it.       I'm not looking to be counselled i just want to talk to someone face-to-face about it and would feel most comfortable talking to my psychology teachers about it. They have already approached me about it but i was kind of in denial about it then and said nothing was wrong. I can still tell they are concerned but they haven't approache me for a while.      However, i don't know if they would have to inform anyone else, including my parents, about my situation even if i just wanted to talk to them about it and because i'm 18 so they shouldn't be legally obliged to inform my parents, should they?       Also, even though i'm 18, do they still have to inform other teachers or counsellors at my school??   Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

Desde hace unos 15 a?os tengo un molesto "ojo de pescado" (creo que así se llama) en la parte de abajo del dedo de un pié.  Es una carnosidad redonda e insensible que crece todo el tiempo.   Cuando me crece al punto de ser molesto me lo corto con un cutter (navaja).  Cuando me lo corto no siento nada porque es como piel muerta.      Una vez fuí con un otropedista y me dijo que por dentro la carnosidad tenía una froma cónica.  Me lo extripó dolorosamente cortándolo de raíz y con curaciones posteriores.  Pero eventualmente me volvió a crecer.      Luego compré unos parchesitos del "Dr. Scholl" y medio lo eliminaba, pero siempre vuelve a crecer.      ?Alguien sabe porqué se forma? ?cómo se cura?.

They had siblings. They had friends who actually cared for them. They were average in school. They werent that popular but werent picked on but did have a lot of friends. They werent crazy or had any serious mental problem. Maybe had depression once or something. Could they just want to kill people? Could they want to shoot their parents, or do a school shooting or just kill? Could they want to do something like Columbine massacre or the christopher Porco case?      Sorry, we were talking about stuff in Health but they never say anything about people who get brought up in a normal living condition.

I am 15 years old but on the indications it said it shouldn't be given to children under 12 due to Reye's syndrome.

20090225105627AAjcxyt	Health;Other - Health	What is the longest you have had a migraine last?	My 5 year old was diagnosed with migraines yesterday, she has had a constant headache for almost 5 weeks.  When the headaches started she was running a high fever, and now the fever is gone and the headaches remain.  The reason I ask is because when I was trying to find more information on migraines the sites say they don't last longer than 72 hours and if they do consult your doctor.  Her doctor put her on 2 different medicines, but one she only takes at the beginning of a headache, which is impossible because her pain is constant.  Any help from migraine suffers would be greatly appreciated, she is the first person in our family to suffer from them.  I am just trying to get as much info on them as possible, its breaking my heart to see my daughter in so much pain for so long.  Thank you

20090225072458AA5Yy8u	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Do you know if fever must be present in order for a toddler to be checked for urinary tract infection?	My toddler has been needing naps mornings and afternoons for about two weeks... also was not as ready to eat during meal time and increasingly whiny.  Then two days ago, he vomitted and the following day developed a high fever and diahrrea.  We took him to the doctor's (at a clinic), who ruled out many things and took an urine sample to check for possible urinary infection.  The result came back positive and he advised us to go to a hospital to get it tested again.  But later, he called us to ask if the fever had gone and we said yes, it had gone down this morning (without meds) and his temperature was normal all day.  So he said, no fever, no need to have him checked out at the hospital.  But, I read about urinary infection in BabyCenter and it said that other symptoms may or may not appear with the fever AND that there MAY OR MAY NOT BE A FEVER.  I checked several other articles online, but they all kind of said that there would be a fever.   Now, the other symptoms are feeling unwell, not eating as well, vomiting, and diahrrea... and I think being irritated.   Well, my toddler doesn't talk yet, so I can't ask him if it hurts when he pees.   He's been doing poorly for two weeks, like I said, and I think that he has (had) all the symptoms except for the fever, which went away today.  (So, in other words, he had a high fever for two days before it went away.)   I still want to have him checked at the hospital, but my husband says not to bother because the doctor at the clinic said it's not necessary unless the fever comes back.  But, my son has been motioning to me whenever I would change his diapers and he's been very irritable this past week.  So, plus what I've read in the BabyCenter article, I really want to take him to do another urine test.  But, if my husband is not convinced, I will have noone to drive me.  (It is not possible for me to drive safely in this terrible Asian city that I live in now.)      Please, someone tell me if you know if there HAS to be a fever or if the fever is gone, I can pretty much rule out the possibiliy of a urinary infection EVEN if he has all the other symptoms.  If I can know for sure, it will help me when I communicate with my husband.      I've done a research, but I'm still confused by the stuff I read.      Can anyone tell me about your experience with infants/toddlers or if you are a doctor, can you answer my question?  Thank you all in advance.

Each time they put me on antibiotics but the blood doesnt go away. It is very visible. I have no pain, just the blood. I cant get into the urologist until mid April, so Im wondering if I should just go to the ER and make someone look at me. I feel like I am getting brushed off cause Im young (27) and they think I have an infection, but nothing has ever shown up on my u/a's except blood. I dont even know that they would do anymore at the ER, just trying to get any Dr. to pay attention. Any suggestions??

I've heard that Tonsillitis includes swelled throat glands, infected tonsils, and white patches on them... Well, I can't swallow, and it brings incredible pain when I try. I don't see any white patches on my tonsils, but they're red...Water doesn't work, I've even tried ice-cream... I get this sore throat ALOT, it started this time last year. The first time I went to the doctor, I was diagnosed with strep, and took pills. But every time I go since I took the medicene, it turns out to be a painful sore throat. My doctor recently closed his practice.      Do I need a personal doctor to see about surgery?       Am I too old/ young to get my tonsils removed? (I'm turning thirteen soon.)      If it doesn't sound like I have tonsillitis (or a need for surgery) what might I have?      Thanks. :)

20090225105249AAiteZX	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Do I Have A Kidney Infection Or Just A Bad Back?	I am a 5ft3 17year old female and have always been healthy. On New Years Day 2009 I woke up with a sharp pain in my back, on the left side, just below my ribs. It disappeared after a few days and I thought nothing of it. Then towards the end of January, it returned, and I suddenly began to need to toilet very frequently (up to 15 times a day!). Again, this passed within a week and although I had the occasional twinge in my back, everything seemed ok. However, the sharp pains returned last week and instead of it being specifically in one place, it is now a constant dull ache radiating from the left of my back just below my ribs all the way down my back and round my side to the bottom left of my torso. This is there constantly and then the stabbing pain comes and goes both below my ribs and just above my hip.      It does tend to get worse when I've been on my feet for a few minutes which I find quite strange!      Is it just a bad back or should I see a doctor?

So i did the urine test and gave it back to the doctor she checked it and said their was a LOT of blood in the urine which was not visible.She said she will send it to the hospital to be checked and to ring on the tuesday to see the results.      The tuesday comes so i ring and ask for the results and they said that they can not tell me the results even though they had them their and they said that i had to come in to see the doctor so they gav eme an appoitment for the next day.      I arrive at the appoitment and the doctor says i need to take another urine test so i asked if the results where clear and he said no because their was cells found in my urine that should not really be their. I asked what it could be he said another urine test will confirm what it is.      This has really worried me could it be cancer or what other things can it be?       Any help will be gratefull thankyou    X
