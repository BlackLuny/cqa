20090128152511AAFuN40	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Question for vector algebra/ physics people?	I was in physics just a few seconds ago and I'm a little confused over vectors       When you add vectors by head to tail you get a resultant vector. In my previous experience the resultant vector is just the addition of vectors. If x(arrow) = 4 and y(arrow) = 3 then the resultant vector when added head to tail is just 7. The professor said to use the Pythagoreom thm and the resultant vector would be 5.       But is that for head to tail or head to head or tail to tail???       Another thing when two vectors are added tail to tail you just add right but when two vectors are added head to head you subtract??

During a lesson at school or a workseet or reading a book (which I love) or really anything! And I'm always having to move my leg up and down or tap my hands on the table.   Sometimes I just have to get up and walk around the room before I explode from anxiety.      I go through times of the day where I'm just filled with energy and when I'm not, I'm lazy. If I tell myself I need to get up and do my homework or practice my instrument... I find myself sitting there and not wanting/doing it for no reason.         Also, if someone across the room is tapping their pen on the desk, it drives me ABSOLUTLY insane. Completely. Same with if my small dog is laying against me and starts scratching her ear, the sudden and rapid movement against me makes me want to just pull my hair out and scream and cry. I know it sounds... dramatic... but I can't take it!      So... what could I possibly have? I just can't concentrate!   I want to get tested for ADD, ADHD, and anxiety...      Any ideas? D:

Justify your answer in each case. Throughout consider "or" as inclusive, although in some examples there may be no object that satisfies both conditions of the "or" statement. Use parentheses where appropriate.      1. mountain or valleys;   2. mountains rich in minerals or valleys rich in minerals;   3. mountains or valleys, provided that the formation is rich in minerals;   4. mountains rich in vegetation, but not mountains rich in minerals;   5. mountains, provided that they are rich in vegetation, but not in minerals;   6. the class of objects that are not mountains.
