TSc8OE4vaa	People will hire you, but don't expect to make a ton of money.  It is better to get a day job, then work on the horses in your spare time.    Another good idea is to get a day job, then use some money to buy a cheap young and green horse.  Then train the horse and sell it at a profit.  Make sure that the horse has enough potential to be worth the time, though.    I am the same age with the same experience as you.  I get paid to work at horse summer camps, I muck stalls at minimum wage, and I ride horses that need work.    Another thing I am doing this summer is training a pony and taking a 15% commission of his sale when he gets sold at the end of the summer.  He should sell for 7000-10000 depending on how well he turns out so that can be a money maker.    Just don't rely on horses as your primary income source, unless you own a boarding barn or are a big-name trainer it won't work.|`|r5aokD7Yaa	I'd suggest a day job-- whatever you can find that doesn't drive you nuts and pays the bills... with horses on the side.    Personally, I dropped out of college and tried the horse trainer gig-- for a while, it seemed like the perfect job, until I finally figured out I couldn't pay board on MY horse on the meager paychecks I received (and broke my foot & hand in the process).    I tried working for the girl scouts on a horseback riding camp-- same story.    Eventually, I went back to college.    I sincerely wish you best luck-- please learn from my mistakes and seriously consider your budget when looking at jobs.|`|804Qdfmoaa	If there is a barn near you then you can work there. Sometimes barns need help with giving lessons, helping little kids tack up, and taking care of the horses. I used to help my friend work at a barn and it was so much fun. If you've been riding for 13 years then I'm sure they wouldn't mind having you around!|`|50KYf5KMaa	Horse training is a very difficult business to get into.  Because the economy is so bad, people can barely afford to keep their horses, let alone pay someone to ride it for them.  And their first things they'll let go are hobbies if theyre struggling, which means horses.  You should do all the things the people before me suggested.
AA11716304	looks like a urine infection.vet time.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	See your vet, it could be a serious bladder infection. The fact that it has been untreated for 3 weeks could mean it is getting worse and spreading.  it could also be a hormone problem. my lab had it, the vet gave us a pill to give to her, and she was fine.  so there's no way for me to just tell you what's wrong with your dog. The only way (and the best way) is to see your vet ASAP just in case.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	1st: try to put her out every hour until it calms.    or    Watch her secretly and once she is about to run and scream and make noise like mad for a sec. Repeat this until she gets the point. Make sure you clean her pee spots VERY GOOD because she will pee in the same area over and over.    Do not hit, though it seems like your last hope. The secret to a well trained dog who trusts you must not be from fear, it should be from her just knowing that you are boss and still love her.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	I'm wondering if she has a bladder infection?    In order to test you'll need to bring a sample to the vet.|`|C5RdjN57aa	Dogs can get urinary tract infections, this can cause frequent urination and not being able to hold. it.   They can also get weak bladders with age and become incontinent.  There is medication for both problems.|`|pFBaMlI8aa	well, it is good that you do not hit or scream at her when she has urinated in the house, although putting her in a dog crate is not helpful either. the only way you can discourage this behavior is to punish her as soon as, or immediately after, she urinates. punishing her at the moment you find it is not effective and is like putting a child in their room for awhile six hours after they have broken a rule. if you find that she has urinated somewhere and she has not done it recently (within a few minutes), just clean it up and do not punish your dog. if you find her in the act of urinating, scold her firmly, but not "meanly". as for why she is doing this, if it was not an accident and was more than just a little amount, she probably had to pee and couldn't hold it any longer. make sure that she gets enough opportunity to urinate in the "right" place, like outside or on a pad. when you see her urinate in the place you would like her to, praise her by saying something short and simple - but don't overdo it. hope this helps!|`|GMrtEYj6aa	take her to the vet,diabetes or bladder infection.|`|naVUguuHaa	Sounds like a URI to me, since it's out of the blue etc. My advice would be to consult a vet. Not necessarily make an appointment, just talk on the phone with one.|`|YW29Fe8Yaa	Our female dog did that and she had a bladder infection.  Took her to the vet they gave her medicine and it cleared it right up|`|TM7o75ODaa	Is your dog on a schedule? Try taking her for a walk to do her business three times a day: morning around seven or eight, early evening around four or five, and at night around nine or ten. If her "accidents" continue, try lightly spraying her face with a water bottle. You are doing a good job not screaming or yelling at her since that would only confuse her. However, the water bottle sends a clear and concise message across that she has done a bad deed and she need not do it again. Don't worry, it will not hurt her. It will only teach her to change her habits.|`|AzrARnZBaa	check if she has a uren problem|`|okAYAGvXaa	When this happens, is your dog AWARE of it, or is she perhaps resting or even asleep???  Also, is she spayed???  Late Entry : UTI means usually dribbling, not a full release of bladder.|`|ZZVF4Lusaa	She does need to go to the vet.  She may have a urinary tract infection, or she may be incontinent.  If it's a UTI, they'll probably put her on antibiotics.  If it's incontinence, there is a daily medication for that as well.|`|aOsMqwbfaa	My cat does this. I think it has to do with not being spayed if that is the case.
McjaM0hDaa	yea they are good dogs but there is also 1) Caucasian Shepherd 2) Cane Corso 3) Argentinian Mastiff 4) Boerboel 5) The Moscow Watchdog 6) Greater Swiss Mountain Dog 7) Doberman Pinscher are some other dogs. but for in the desert you should get a dog that u can really take care of. good luck!!!!!|`|0HAn67yZaa	full grown male dobermans stand 26 to 28 inches tall and weigh between 66 and 88 pounds.    females stand 24 to 26 inches and weigh 66 to 88 pounds full grown.      full grown male rottweilers stand 24 to 27 inches and weigh between 95 and 130 pounds.      female rottweilers stand 22 to 25 inches tall and weigh between 85 and 115 pounds full grown.    so the rottweiler is bigger.      i think a rhodesian ridgeback would be a great choice for you, they do well in hot weather, they originate from africa and can do well in the heat, and they are big dogs, males stand between 25 and 27 inches and weigh between 80 and 90 pounds.    females stand between 24 and 26 inches full grown and grow to weigh between 65 and 75 pounds.|`|34177bb54269d5ebbff24c7a4a6881d1aa	honestly....ALL dogs are good guard dogs. just how you train them.    however, dobermans, rottys and pitbulls are obvious choices for most people as they are 'intimidating' rather than a small say, yorkie???  also, they are bred for guarding, so its instinct, so they are simply..easier to train.    as for your pitbull, i honestly think that was lucky. this guy was your friend? this dog knows him maybe (is he round yours often?), so wanted to play..you have to be careful, you dont want the dog to bite EVERYONE!...    I would train your dog to bark when he hears an intruder. not bite. it almost sounds like you want that?? im not sure.     if you can train your dog to bark on command. and control it when someone comes in. it helps.    hope this helps|`|b8QUR7Qzaa	a boxer iv u train it right it can be very loyal and protective|`|HcMvtMT7aa	As far as size, a rotty will get thicker and not taller, but a dobie can get tall but not thicker.  Bigger doesn't really mean better for protection.  It takes a dogs ability to be territorial and to become attached to you.  Both are very loyal dogs.  But I would suggest having it professionally trained.  From your question, I can safely assume that you have no experience with  guard dogs.  Yes, they can be loyal, but if you abuse or treat a dog with "tough love" or hit the dog, then that "loyal friend" can become very unpredictable towards you.|`|Flrnnme1aa	The best watch dogs plus loving with the family is   GERMAN SHORTHAIRS.|`|bOBGD3j3aa	Dobermans are ugly get a pittbull|`|iABAZj2Haa	You can get a german shepard, a st bernard, a boxer    and as weird as this sounds ..  little dogs are good too in a way because my dog can tell when someone is even about to come near my house.     but yeah just some ideas.|`|YweJ1PfUaa	get  both|`|m56Ty3zmaa	I've always liked dobermans....they look cool and if you train and treat them right.... make good pets as well as good guard dogs...|`|5hWnamNZaa	I would say a German Sheperd or mabey a Rottweiler|`|KKuzo9Gaaa	I have a Doberman and she is a good "guard dog". She is calm and playful, but if someone or something comes up and she doesn't know who it is, she starts barking and looks at you for permission to attack it.     Usually it's a bird or a squirrel, but sometimes it's one of our neighbors with their little baby and you have to tell her no.    Rots are a little too aggressive and a little too big. I have heard many,many,many bad things about them and I don't trust the one bit.    So my choice for you would be a Doberman, although Rots do get bigger and have more meat, they are very dangerous and can turn on you fast, and are not the most "trusted" dogs out there.|`|EijzrUn1aa	Do NOT get a Pit Bull for a guard dog. They are about as terrible at it as Labs or Goldens. They thrive on human attention and love to be around humans. I have seen many cases where people would get Pits as guard dogs and the dogs were the nicest things on the planet. Would walk right up to you and want lovins', and you could probably go in the house and steal anything you want.  I would say a  Rottweiler or a Doberman Pinscher. Those breeds are great with kids, but can be fiercely loyal and protective at the same time. Or you could just get a dog that has a deep bark. That helps most of the time.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	GET A MASTIFF  THEY CAN HANDLE THE HEAT  THEY ARE USED TO ATTACK POACHERS  THEY HAVE GUT  THEY  CAN  BE BITE BUT MOSTLY THEY HOLD THERE MAN DOWN  THEY CAN HOLD DOWN A 300LBS MAN WITH EASE  MY EX HAS ONE  ITS ENOUGH  FRIGHT JUST TO LOOK AT IT  MUCH  LESS EVEN TO APPROACH IT  MY EX HAS HIS TRAINED  IF HE GIVES HIM SIGN OR WORD  HE WILL HOLD THE BIGGEST OF A MAN DOWN  IF HE GIVES A COMMAND THE DOG LETS HIM UP   ITS  BETTER THAN ANY DOG  THERE SO COOL  READ UP ON IT   MASTIFF  OR BULL MASTIFF|`|BSbhYTNXaa	pittbuls are ******* crazy i had doberman once i love them, i had rottweiler 2, their ******* crazy also :D|`|FvmLWWRnaa	You should get a chichaua they killed my pit bull|`|zvqspfSCaa	Dobermans are better then rottweilers. rotts have a tendancy to turn on their owners. not something i have seen on tv but something that a rottweiler breeder has told me.

A couple of tips:      Put tape on electrical wiring so your little ones do not hurt themselves.    Keep household chemicals out of her way  .  Give your little ones a few special toys to chew on:   Soak the chew toys in broth or rub them all over with your hands (your kitten loves your scent and is more likely to chew something that smells like you).    Another thing is to use a cold towel. This helps relieve the pain of teething. Tie a knot in a small clean towel, wet it, wring it out and put it in the freezer to chill. Your kittens will love this!  Teething is a part of growing up, it is very important, so continue to be supportive to your little ones.|`|AA11864010	It's a kitten thing.  That and hiding under furniture and clawing the **** out of your ankles when you walk by.  Get him some toys and that will help a little.

If you kitten was taken away from its mother too young it may be biting on you trying to get milk.  Make sure you have plenty of toys for your kitten to chew on and play with.  This may help.  Your kitten should grow out of it.  If the kitten continues as it gets older, I would consult your vet.  I doubt it is anything to worry about.  Cats are great!  Enjoy your kitten.|`|a05cdca3ee93089a3563b2a4ed7faad8aa	FEED the poor cat|`|AA11806066	A month old???? It needs to be with its mother.  You should never get a kitten that is less than 6 weeks old.

WKA3mmBQaa	It depends on the vet and if it's a male or female. There are vets who do neuters for $45 and spays for $75. There are others where a neuter costs $200 and a spay costs $250 or as much as $400! There are many opinions on spaying/neutering rats. Make sure you find a vet who has done it many times before as it is a dangerous prodecure. Especially for females. For males it can prevent types of cancers and can tame aggression. For females it can prevent some of the more common and dangerous tumors. I would research as much as you could before deciding to get your rats spayed/neutered.|`|AEfiaBAzaa	Well i dont know how much, but the main reason is because fixing a rat isn't needed. Imsrry to say but a rat only lives around three years (and thats pushing it)    I have never fixed any of my rats because:  1) costs too much for this small animal  2)u really dont need to fix a rat, but they r social so get mabye two rats of the SAME SEX so that no fixing is required.  3)Believe me have rats for at least 15 years|`|X1LlP5KPaa	It all depends on where you live and what kind of vet you go to.  An exotics vet will be more expensive but will be more knowledgeable on rats.  I have heard of it ranging anywhere from thirty to a hundred dollars.  You just have to call up some vets and ask.      By the way, thank you for doing enough research to know that you have to buy rats in pairs or groups.  But just to mkae sure, you do know tha they need to be in a huge cage, have frsh food daily, be let out for at least an hour a day to explore, and what kind of bedding to use, right?  Rats are not easy pets to have.  They are a lot of work and are very expensive.  Since you are getting them fixed, I am sure you know all of this, but you can never be too careful.  You should join goosemoose.com and read some threads just to get an understanding and to ask any question you can think of.  There are plenty of very well-informed people on there that will be willing to help you with anything.      -and as a response to the person above me:  No, rats do not NEED to be fixed but it is a good idea.  Females that aren't fixed are much more prone to tumors, males are more prone to aggression, and there is the just in case accidental oops litter factor if they ever come in contact with rats of the opposite sex.  It is purely precautionary, but a good idea in general.|`|FdnShJn9aa	30 dollars!??! Sheesh.

SEvhwIXQaa	I have mixed and matched all sorts of breeds.  A pug and a german shepherd, a border collie and a chow chow, a pit bull and a golden retriever.  And without fail they have ALL gotten along.  But I had to work at it in all of those cases.  Currently I am trying to get my border collie to get along with my dads pomeranian.  The pom likes to play and the border collie doesn't tolerate it very long.  But it's getting better every day.    I'm sure you can mix and match those two breeds.  Your shepherd needs to be well adjusted first.  Make sure your shepherd knows you are the boss and the dogs will be your pack.

Y1LTzXataa	I am glad that you don't want to let the pup sleep inside as this will only make the dog have more serious separation anxiety when you need to go out.    Very small puppies can be comforted by having something with them while they sleep that reminds them of mother. A ticking clock can simulate a heartbeat, a fluffy blanket resembles mother's fur and a hot water bottle reminds pup of mother's warmth.    However, I would forego the hot water bottle if it is hot at the moment where you live. Despite what some people have said, keeping your dog outside does NOT make you a bad pet owner. A bad pet owner is one who doesn't give the dog any discipline.    Also, when you go away from pup, don't make a big deal about it. This will desenstitise your dog to being left alone.    Good luck|`|okAYAGvXaa	So a new pup that cries when left alone OUTSIDE on her own???  I don't even wanna get into this garbage.|`|mZelbkwEaa	YOUR PUPPY IS LONELY. DO NOT LEAVE A YOUNG PUPPY OUTSIDE ALONE.ITS A FREAKIN PUPPY HE SHOULD SLEEP INSIDE AND LIVE INSIDE, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?     How would you like being plucked from your family and never seeing them agian, you would probably be sad. Then after being plucked from your family and home stuck in some strangers back yard alone for hours at a time? Answer you would be miserable and hate it.  Spend time with your puppy interacting with him. Make sure he does not have run of your entire house. At first they should be confined to one room and gradually over a couple weeks or months time shone more of your house. Take him to a puppy class to socialize. Feed him from your hand or from a rubber toy for entertainment. Go to google and type how to stuff a kong for help.     SHE IS LONELY AND BORED AND STUCK ALONE OUTSUIDE dogs are pack animals that need other beings around them. Also it is very possible for a dog to become so lonely and depressed that they actually DIE.     Think about how much you really want the dog because sticking it outside shows you dont want it AT ALL. Thats CRUEL and INHUMANE she is a PUPPY not a full grown dog, and reguardless even as adults they should not be confined to a life outside. You are a terrible and unworthy pet owner form what i can tell by your question.  Best of luck to the puppy and i sincerly hope you do not keep the puppy or change your thoughts and let it inside!!!!      Also letting you dog sleep inside does NOT create seperation anxiety if he is taught how to be independant and given proper exercise and learns basice obedience.     Anyone who leaves a puppy outside doesnot deserve a dog!! Plain and simple they are not lawn decorations they are actual living creatures not for you to keep outside just cause you dont feel like dealing with it. You are all irresponsible for leaving your dogs stuck outside!!!!!|`|Ckw1RCczaa	Where do you live? Because if the winter where you are is anything like the winter where I am, a puppy should NEVER be left outside by itself in winter. If you aren't prepared to be a good pet owner, you shouldn't have gotten a puppy. Bring her inside and get her warm. She's just a puppy, she wants affection and wants to know she's safe. Also try giving her a warm blanket and something to snuggle with. She's probably just been separated from her mother, so you should give her things that will comfort her.|`|5EiG9ZHeaa	listen lil jax u don't know the story and if u all read it properly its not left out all night crying it just for a few hours during the day so don't make assumptions.what would u all do if it shat and peed on ur white carpet it has to learn to go outside to go to the toilet and it needs time outside to play and get used to going outside on a regular basis. it cant run the house unless uve got no fiends or little children like she does to knock over so i suggest u ask questions before saying people don't have the right to have a dog, its like me saying u don't deserve a license to drive|`|r9BXyz9zaa	The answer isn't something you're gonna like.

pFBaMlI8aa	i completely understand what you are talking about. she is just 8 weeks old, still very young, and she is obviously attached to you and loves you a lot. when you put her outside or in another room, she is probably yelping just because she misses you and she is lonely. unfortunately, there is almost nothing you can do about this except to make sure she is not by herself for too long, and to just try to ignore it until she gets older and grows out of it.|`|Qe04KxYoaa	NO dog should be left outside the majority of the time! She should be inside with her family. If you did not want a dog that would love you than why get one? What she is doing is normal what you are doing is wrong.|`|7a63286baf5e33622b08a4aa5f6c9dceaa	A crying puppy is like a crying baby, as long as you know they are fed and all their needs are met, then there is not much more you can do. They will stay up under you for as long as you let them. You have to ween her away from you slowly. Go out for short periods of time so that the puppy gets used to knowing that when you leave it is okay because you will be coming back.|`|X0kqaRRaaa	If she has a dog house already outside, try putting an article of clothing  that you have worn in there. She will be able to at least smell you close. Also, try putting some small toys in there for her; or in the yard.  If outside at night, try putting a wind up clock under her blanket. It will sound like her mom's heartbeat..  If the dog house is big enough, show her that it is o.k. to get in it. Try getting into it yourself.  If you have a door where you can attach a mirror onto it, she will think there is another puppy out there with her- -her own reflection.  There are so many different things you can try...

AA12370480	We didnt leave water because that just makes them need to go to the bathroom and  since you have a puppy, I am sure you are alos trying to train them to go outside. Give them water before the crate and make sure they get outside a lot.  The crate can become a safe place for the dog once it gets older. My dog use to go in there to sleep because she knew everyone would leave her alone. When she outgrew the crate and we had to put it away it took her a few days to adjust to not having it.|`|daa2b8cf126f7cf742389f43877599ceaa	take the pup and run it around etc before you crate it..perhaps being tired will help. make sure they potty before putting them in . unless your house is hot..or you are going to be away really long..no water that can be tipped over. you could get a steel bucket they use a lot in crates and attach it to the side with a snap..that way it cannot be overturned.|`|AA11649328	yes,water and food.. you give them toys and things to do..puppies sleep most of the time anyway.. my dogs all have been crate trained,but you slowly introduce them to the crate..you don't just throw them in there and say here you go!!it takes time for a puppy to go in the crate on its own..but its very good way to train a dog..|`|AA10924432	Have you tried putting small fence? Its almost like the size of a baby playpen.|`|AA11323680	I don't think dogs should be in a crate for that amount of time. I understand if you don't want your puppy chewing everything up while you go grocery shopping or to run an errand (1 hour or so) but I think any longer than that is kind of mean. It's like putting a toddler in time out for 4-5 hours. They don't understand. I think if you have a puppy, you should have the time to devote to training them and loving them. In my opinion, it takes a good 6 weeks of daily consistent effort to fully train a puppy.|`|AA11709234	It is sad.  Why have a puppy just to keep it in the crate for the day????  They are safe, but they are bored!!!  There are no toys that keep a puppy entertained for 4-5 hours!!!!!!  It is one thing to crate train the dog for the night time ( although you still have to get up 1-2 times to take it out) or to crate train for the times that you will not be home...like when shopping or errands.  But to expect that most every day the puppy will stay in a crate for hours is very sad.  Get a cat instead!!!!!!!|`|AA11368728	My hound used to DESTROY my house while I was at work... I started crate training him, and I would put in blankets, a pillow, a few toys (2-4), and water. (he would always be fed before I would put him in the crate) After a few months, he stopped being bad while I was at work so, I stopped putting him in the crate. (also we have another dog now, and I think they keep each other company while I am gone, so there is no need to destroy, cause with another dog around he doesn't get bored and destructive) But when I did put him in the crate, I would always leave the T.V. on so that he would feel like someone is home... not just sitting in his crate in silence... the t.v. really helped with him not feeling alone.|`|0ae149d4ac488373b8204b79afd8d243aa	You should NOT put water in the crate with a puppy.  I fills their blatter and forces them to pee where they lay.  Crate training is a great tool for potty training and all other training.  Dogs don't need that much water.  No food either.  Toys are good, but they shouldn't have enough room to play with them.  I crate trained my dog, she only needed it for a year.

Older puppies can be in a crate for 4-5 hrs with no problem.  Rememer, this is a temporary thing.  When they get old enough, they will have the run of the house.  And mine just pick out a couch or bed and nap when I am gone.

9KVmd9Hzaa	First thing a horses feet are only as good as it's nutrition.  If the horse is on a grain that has high amounts of carbohydrates in it that is going to be hard on on his body and it will show in his feet defiantly.  I have found that if you take out a lot of the goodies( sweet feed, corn, etc.) Detoxify their body, this will help their feet a lot! From what you describe above it could be one of two things- he clipped himself through the boot or - he has a high quarter crack. If it's in the hair line it's almost impossible to see, but it's very common in race horses. Has the owner ever thought about going barefoot(horse)? I have 7 horses that are all barefoot, who get rode 6 days a week and have yet to have one come up lame since I changed their feed,and hoof care. I live in Central Oregon- and do a lot of exercising on trails and still don't' have any problem. I don't think that it's anybodies fault, but is something that definitely needs to be looked into for everybody's sake. I hope this helps.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Long feet, dry feet, week feet, and poor conformation can all cause this.  Excessive work is unlikely to cause this.    Just see what the farrier says, most likely he needs better shoes and more frequent trimmings.  Hoof conditioner might help too, I use horseshooer's secret on my mare when her hooves get dry.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Soft horse hooves are prone to wall cracks.  My mare has soft hooves, and the farrier gave us some hoof dressing.  That is a bad case of wall crack.  If it bled, I wouldn't jump it, or go faster than a walk for a long time (until it heals) and long feet crack because they get brittler.  This horse doesn't seem in the right hands.  I feel sorry for the guy.  Also too bad to hear you got kicked.  Hope you aren't in pain.  Its from vigerous workouts and semi-long feet.  Either/or.|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	Also too if he has had thrush in his feet the fungus can cause the feet to crack.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	Hooves crack due to poor nutrition, poor hoof care (poor technique and too long between trims), over grown hoof walls, being exposed to changing environments frequently i.e. wet, dry, wet, dry.   Activity stimulates growth strength in the hooves as a general rule so that is not the problem unless there are underlying structural weaknesses.  As long as he is wearing shoes and has poor care, his feet will never be as strong as they could be.  If his injury was above the coronary band in the hair line, it could have been due to interference.  It does not sound as if this has anything to do with the "wall crack".  Doesn't sound related.  It does not sound as if this poor guy has reasonable care so it is unlikely his future will improve which is very sad.    As an aside, the last thing a hoof needs if it is cracking is some kind of "conditioner".  A horse's feet can never be too dry or too hard.  All conditioners are detrimental to a horse's hoof wall.  While some believe they make the feet look "prettier", they are harmful.   All chemicals should be avoided.  The only benefit is garnered by the manufacturer as they are of zero benefit to the horse.  If you don't know what kind of problem or injury has been suffered by the horse, you should not just apply what is available and "leave it".  Again, this could be detrimental to the horse.  Inform a responsible individual and make an attempt to avoid putting the horse at risk.

Mw49Vjs6aa	Assuming it is a high quality feed rather than the cheap grocery store stuff, nutritionally there is very little difference between canned and dry dog food.  Canned dog food contains much more water (about 80%) and of course is much more expensive.      Dry food has the advantage of helping to clean teeth, as others have noted.      Dry food, served in enough water to float the kibble or perhaps a bit more, should be fine.  Just be sure the size of the kibble is manageable for the dog.  If not, a quck "blib" in a coffee grinder for blender will break it up nicely.|`|322582d735a927f0dbcd0ead5902a454aa	dry food is better for the dogs health if you noticed the recent food recalls were all wet food as in can food   most vets recommend feeding dry food for all ages growth is recommended for puppies better teeth and better breathe  and overall heath|`|yrwqHlW2aa	Sure..

Dry dog food is just fine to give to a 3 month old mine did just fine with it, but if yours seems to be haveing problems chewing it or what not, mix it with some warm water for a few minutes and it will soften it up. But definatly feed dry food instead of canned.|`|5af8PNwxaa	No dog food is good for puppies.    You need to get one labelled "Puppy food" as puppies have very sensitive tummy's as well as the pieces being puppy size.    It's just the same as human babies, they cannot digest solids until they are a certain age, puppies tummy's are the same.    http://puppycare.com/index.php/Puppy-Foo...|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Dry dog food is fine, you can mix a little warm water in to soften it a little, but it is better for the teeth and gums in cleaning them and preventing gum disease than canned/wet food.     The most important thing with a puppy though is to make sure it is on a good quality puppy food, not adult food as they need a different balance of Proteins/Carbs and levels of minerals and nutrients in order to promote healthy growth and development. You also need to make sure it is a complete food, not just a mixer.    I feed all my dogs dry food, they tuck in and love it and I have no problems with bad breath, bad gums, plaque or tartar, which my parents always used to have feeding my childhood dogs on canned food.
xvRvkSVoaa	onions are poisonous to dogs, it causes something bad in there blood, you better get him to a vet soon.    Onions and garlic are other dangerous food ingredients that cause sickness in dogs, cats and also livestock. Onions and garlic contain the toxic ingredient thiosulphate. Onions are more of a danger.    Pets affected by onion toxicity will develop haemolytic anaemia, where the pets red blood cells burst while circulating in its body.    At first, pets affected by onion poisoning show gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhoea. They will show no interest in food and will be dull and weak. The red pigment from the burst blood cells appears in an affected animals urine and it becomes breathless. The breathlessness occurs because the red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body are reduced in number.    The poisoning occurs a few days after the pet has eaten the onion. All forms of onion can be a problem including dehydrated onions, raw onions, cooked onions and table scraps containing cooked onions and/or garlic. Left over pizza, Chinese dishes and commercial baby food containing onion, sometimes fed as a supplement to young pets, can cause illness.    Onion poisoning can occur with a single ingestion of large quantities or with repeated meals containing small amounts of onion. A single meal of 600 to 800 grams of raw onion can be dangerous whereas a ten-kilogram dog, fed 150 grams of onion for several days, is also likely to develop anaemia. The condition improves once the dog is prevented from eating any further onion    While garlic also contains the toxic ingredient thiosulphate, it seems that garlic is less toxic and large amounts would need to be eaten to cause illness.    http://www.petalia.com.au/templates/stor...    http://www.jlhweb.net/Boxermap/onions.ht...|`|okAYAGvXaa	Onion is toxic when ingested in larger amounts. Keep an eye on your pup though.|`|Y1LTzXataa	Onion is very bad for dogs and you should try to make sure they don't eat it. Potatoes and chocolate can also be toxic to dogs.    However, a small amount of onion peel shouldn't be a major concern. Sometimes puppies will stop eating if they have diarrhoea because it makes them feel sick.    If your pup has diarrhoea you can try giving it mashed pumpkin. I'm not sure if a dog will eat mashed pumpkin but cats seem to love it and it is a good cure for diarrhoea.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	My two dogs got into the trash and ate some onion peel, neither one of them could have gotten very much, the tiny beagle, got the poops and vomiting and for the Boston it dewormed her better than anything i had ever used I don't recommend it though and you should call your vet if he starts getting sick, basically it won't do anything to some dogs and some dogs can get very sick.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	lol damn puppies... they eat everything.

a2cjwMKcaa	Is the tank cycled?    If its newly set up you MUST be very carefull adding fish to it.    Although the tank could easily support 10 small fish, once it's properly established, it wont right now.    Your options are, cycle the tank with fish. That means adding a couple of small hardy fish, and then waiting for the tank to cycle and settle down. That takes a couple of weeks, then you can add a few more each week untill it's full.    OR    Do a full fishless cycle to grow the bacteria that the tank needs to run properly. Read the link below for more info.    Also type of fish. You tank is too small for goldfish to live in long term, you may buy them small, but if they are healthy, they will grow - BIG. If you have a heater then small tropical fish like guppies, platies, cory catfish etc are good. If you dont have a heater, look for some White Cloud Minnows, they stay small, can live happily in cold water and do fine in a 10gal tank.    Good luck    Ian|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Have you cycled the fish tank? If not, any fish you buy tomorrow will be dead by Monday.  Http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/The_Nitro...    There is no magic number answer to your question. And the inch per gallon rule DOESN'T work.    What and how many fish you chose depend on the species and that species needs.

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	I also have a "kitten" who was over 11 lbs at eight months.  The vet said he was going to be a very large cat.    I feed my cats canned food and a raw meat diet.  Dry food has far too many carbohydrates for a lot of cats and can lead to obesity.    He is old enough to eat twice a day and that should be a quality canned meat (Wellness, Natural Balance, Avoderm, Instincts, Evo, etc.)    Go to http://www.littlebigcat.com and read some of Dr. Jean Hovfe's articles on cat nutrition, such as "What Cats Should Eat", "Why Cats Need Canned Food", and particularly since your cat is male "Urinary Tract Disorders in Cats."|`|jQeQYebmaa	3 times a day but in a small bowl|`|vn1kT1t5aa	pretty much only 2 ways to tell: go to vet and ask, or look at back of bag of cat food for guidelines...|`|85XV1229aa	First of all, he is not considered a kitten at 8 months old, even though I think so. Most cat foods cut off kitten portions at 4 or 5 months. When I first got Ashton (at 2 months), the dry food bowl was always filled and we fed him 1/2 of the small cans of wet food (Fancy Feast) twice per day. Now he is 6 months old and his dry food is always filled and we give him 1/2 of a regular can of wet food (Friskies) twice a day. We also put a crushed up cat vitamin in his wet food in the morning for extra sources of minerals. This is good because when the wet food is depleted, he eats the dry. Dry food is better for cats and helps their teeth. Ask your vet if you are still not sure. You can also email me at: APlaya6795@aol.com if you have further questions! :)|`|7dc556d67f0e9a4f5714fa5d96b331b7aa	Some cats can have food left out all day and night and do not have a weight problem.  If your friends think he seems thin then I would leave him free feed and see how it goes.    Measure out his food with a measuring cup so you know how much he's eating.  If he gets too big cut back on what you give him slowly so he doesn't starve and you get the amount right.    If he's eating can food then he should be getting no less than a 5.5 oz can maybe more if he's active.    Young cats who are not fixed are usually more active and can eat more.  Once you get him fixed he will probably put on more weight.  If you don't get him fixed soon chances are he will start peeing all over your house.
4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Cats generally will NOT eat the s/d food.  Get some baby food from the grocery store.  It must have NO onion or garlic powder added.  I believe Gerber's Stage 2 chicken or lamb is "pure".    He will be in more serious trouble if he does not eat so that is the first priority.  You can use the baby food for about three days, then you must switch to a food such as Wellness chicken or turkey to get the taurine he needs (baby food has no taurine).  You can add a teaspoon of filtered water to the canned cat food - the baby food is quite moist.    See if you can get methionine from a health food store and add a teaspoon of that to the canned food.  It is what is added to the s/d to acidify the urine.    Infection is another deal alltogether and your cat should have some antibiotic from the original vet for that.    If your cat does not eat, does not urinate he will lose his life!  You must be prepared to hospitalize him if that happens.|`|7dc556d67f0e9a4f5714fa5d96b331b7aa	There are some places online that will help you with vet care in life threatening situations.  Unfortunately you will have to find them yourself I don't have the links.  Some of your local vets know about these programs so please ask them if you can't find them yourself.

Do some research on the internet and see if there are any local Humane Society-sponsored hospitals (like VCA here in CA), and see if they can help you. Usually, those places offer services such as hospitalizing your animal and meds but at a discounted price. Good luck and I hope you cat feels better.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	The vet has told you what you can do to help him. So your choices are a) find some money b) give him to someone who can afford him or c) let him die - because his condition is life-threatening if left untreated. Male cats can die when their bladders become blocked, as they will eventually rupture if not unblocked. Plus he has a kidney infection.    If he isn't peeing, he needs to go to a vet asap, blocked bladders are considered an emergency situation in males for the reasons I've described above. If you're in England, you can contact the Cats Protection for help, or the PDSA if you're on benefits. Don't wait to find help though, get the cat to the vet and sort out finances later - and TELL the vet money is a problem, they would rather you tell them so something can be worked out than wait til it comes to bill paying time to find you can't afford it.     Chalice|`|xgKQrEhqaa	Explain the financial situation to your vet NOW.  They may have a payment system that you can pay later, or in small amounts or even a discount.  Don't wait get it worked out well in advance of the hospitalization showing you are responsible to in fact pay it off.|`|GoEdpprvaa	I'm not sure if it will help for your cat's condition but you could try & get him to go by taking a wet paper towel & wiping on his thingy.

If he's truely suffering, then you should have him put down if you can't give him away.

I don't know!!!  =S  I find hamsters are cleaner, and easier to look after, but generally i have to say i'm so attatched to RATS!! :D|`|NVx3iRZJaa	While hamsters are cute and really funny sometimes, rats are also cute and funny, not to mention extremely intelligent and their depth perception allows them to ride on your shoulder, and jump from great distances and if you were to put a hamster on your shoulder , it would just run right off and go splat.  Rats are cuddlier then hamsters MOST of the time...    I have a rat and a hamster sooooo... I'm just gonna vote twice. One for each.  XD|`|lhmsAlQuaa	HAMSTERS!! HAMSTERS HAMSTERS VOTE HAMSTERS!!!!  lol can i be chosed as best answer please please please lol im 13!|`|7TuMvfraaa	hamsters....|`|X1LlP5KPaa	Depends.  If you are young and not financially stable, then hamster.  Rats are very expensive, need a good vet, appropriate-sized cage (VERY expensive) another or several rat companions, good fresh food daily, at least an hour a day out of cage free-range time.  Hamsters are easy.  Please, if you are asking whether to get rats or hamsters, then the answer is hamster.|`|hZWup7xXaa	rats|`|EijzrUn1aa	I personally like rats better. My previous Hamster had a annoying wheel and he would only get in it when I would lie down to go to bed.|`|3BVDSwgNaa	I have both but prefer my ratties.  Ratties can:  * sit on your shoulder (hamster will fall)  * can run up your arm ( see above )  * will groom you  * will come when you call  * plays games   * are more social and intelligent  * can run around a table and play w/o falling off  * are actually HAPPY to see you and cling to the bars til you let them out    Hamster are nice pets though for ppl that don't need alot of interaction though, I am quite fond of the two I have but LOVE the ratties!|`|WLPDJ3Npaa	Neither anymore...    I love rats though. My rat would bury her head in my arm. She was a good pet.    I had one, she was my favorite pet, and then one day I woke up and she was just dead in her cage.    She had food and water, the vet I called said that sometimes small rodents just die. Or they are sick but they don't show it because they are prey animals.    It was sad.|`|hDQNCG31aa	hamsters|`|DgqjjJqJaa	Rats, they are so much smarter. Plus they will actually cuddle up with you in your sleeve or pocket or in your hood. They are so much friendlier.|`|zdBInQReaa	I like rodents in general, so... I am not allowed to have a rat, because my mom is afraid of their tails. So I would have to say hamsters because I have never had a rat.|`|6cD9Ig2oaa	RATS!|`|ltlNGzmkaa	hamsters are cute but.......  rats because u can train them just like a dog and to stay in ur pocket at all times|`|ezBINPDAaa	i love hamsters because rats sometimes eats you wall.|`|E0SCI7RLaa	Hamsters cuter   they have stubby tails not long pink tails (not a big fan of thier tales)  and thier fluffy
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	A 2.5 gallon is pretty tricky and is too small for 99% of fish species.    You can fit a single Betta (siamese fighter), just, but that's it. Its too small for guppies, they're too active, and definitely too small for 5 of anything.    A Betta would rule out shrimp as they'd be viewed as dinner.    Filters, go for a sponge filter for a Betta, go for a 25w heater and the tank still needs to cycle, although it will be hard to maintain the water chemistry balance.  Http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/The_Nitro...    Small tanks are far more difficult to care for than bigger tanks 20g plus.|`|2Jmodoaeaa	Well, to start you off you are definetly going to need a much bigger tank. 2.5 gallons will hold maybe 1 to 2 guppies, and guppies need to be kept in groups. For a healthy guppy tank, I would suggest a 10 gallon tank. You can find cheap 10 gallon starter kits at petco or petsmart. Those come with a good filter, good heater, good hood, and even some food. Great to get you started on your new tank. For a 10 gallon tank I would suggest maybe 8-10 guppies would be a great number. I got both the 10 and 20 gallon starter kits myself. The filters and heaters that come with them are perfect for the tank. I have 10 fancy guppies in my 10 gallon, and 2 fancy goldfish in the 20 gallon and both tanks worked out great! good luck, and if you need anything just e-mail me.|`|sREBdx35aa	if you don't have room for a larger tank then a 2 1/5 will have to do. i would recommend horn wort plants. as for fish, no more than five smaller type would be best. visit a mom and pop pet store they seem to take more time with their customers. Pick what YOU want from the list the store owner recommends. lots of luck.|`|AA11451786	just put a couple of goldfish in it and you don't have to do anything but feed them and change the wateronce in a while|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	a tank that small is a waste of money.     you can't put a betta in it, they need a reliable heat source.   so do all other tropical fish.   that means ZERO guppies, zero anything.    you can't do goldfish, cause the tank is to small.....      sell it, or return it if it is still in the box, and get at least a 10 gallon with a heater.     or, turn it into a low light nano planted tank....no fish.|`|t9zkYE3baa	Hello.    I wouldn't put Fancy Guppies in a 2.5 gallon aquarium.  But a good - No, great fish for a 2.5 is a Betta fish.  You may want to get the larger, female Ghost shrimp with a Betta.  Betta will need a filter, like the Whisper 3i.  And get a Hydor Mini Heater for 2-5 gallon tanks.  I got my stuff at Petsmart.  (It's exactly what I have)  Get marbles for the groundcover.

YNnTPiHYaa	Make him a little doggie door. We don't let our dog drink after 8:00pm or he'll be nudging you hand at 3:00 am . When I let him out in the morning I have to pretend I'm doing something on the table cause if I watch to see what he's doing he just won't go,  then play with me like he has to go back out.Once in the morning -afternoon, and after dinner|`|ixFbNr4taa	It's called Potty-Training which mean you have to be there to train the dog.      You can not expect a young dog to understand why you are sending it outside.  You must put it on a leash each and every time.  Get a crate and begin a training schedule.  For instance, he eats his meal and then you know he will have to go in 10-15 minutes.  So - leash him up and go for a walk around your yard.  When he pees or poops - praise him!!  If he does not go in 10 minutes - bring him back inside and crate him.  Wait another 20-30 minutes and try again.  He is not allowed to roam free in your house until you know he's "empty".      Also - when he is good and pees in front of you -- you grab him up and run back in the house.  That makes dogs not want to go potty.  It is a pleasant experience for them to be outside and wander around smelling stuff.  So he has learned that if he pees he's taken inside -- not a good outcome from his point of view.  So - when he does go potty - be sure to stay outside an extra 10 minutes or so.  He will be much more willing to go to the bathroom if he realizes that he will not be snatched up and shoved inside.      GOOD LUCK - and get out there & train with him!!!    Here's a great training schedule -- pick one for your family and use it!!!    http://www.ltah.net/Housebreaking.pdf|`|Mw49Vjs6aa	A dog can be house trained at any age.  I recommend using an airline crate as a housetraining tool, as well as safe place for your dog to hang out when s/he wants a bit of privacy.      For details, check out the article at http://www.clickersolutions.com/articles...|`|BfiRm5cbaa	dont worry, my dog is the same he hates outside but every once and a while he'll go out , ur dog is just one that likes to chill see heres a pic of my dog        http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...|`|pd394CQyaa	i he is doning it at this age he will probably never stop|`|OKifJyUwaa	it does take time and patience to train your dog.  I never had my pup trained.  SHe been an outside dog since i got her and after leaving her out there a long time.  SHe didnt go in the house at all.  Thats cuz she been outside dog for a few months
lhOd2hvXaa	You can go to any veterinarian and they will write a note to the county verifying that the dog has been neutered.  Even if he/she did not do the neuter, it's easily verified.|`|ydshiNrKaa	contact the vet where you had it done and he can give you a certificate stating that the dog was neutered.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	You should be able to get a copy from where ever you had it done.  If he's been to a vet recently, the would have documentation of him being neutered, and I would think that would be sufficient too.|`|iU1ULFWVaa	go to the vet and ask for a bill that says he is neutered, or ask for a copy, they should be able to help you. You can take it directly to the county office for faster service!|`|AA10421992	Contact the vet that did the surgery and ask for a verification letter.|`|AA11764538	Ask any vet to verify that indeed the dog is neutered and then send that note to the county.|`|3SMvCETmaa	Call the vet that did it and have them send you the certificate for it..|`|2ofzcrdGaa	Go to the vet so he can verify that he is neutered and get a  certificate from that vet then take the paper work to get a license. Is it mandatory in you county? what a wonderful county|`|lg3MQJsnaa	You can go to any vet and they can write a note stating that your dog is, in fact, neutered. It would be easier (and cheaper) just to get a letter of certificate of verification from the vet who did the procedure, but either way works.    Or just take him to the county and say "Look Ma! No balls!"    Sorry, had to get that out there :D
ydshiNrKaa	Just being there for him and letting him talk to you about his best friend and companion.|`|egLhVY35aa	maybe make him a frame or photo album of him and his dog or something small to remember him by?  also get or make or do him something he enjoys (to get his mind off of his beloved doggie.  i know everyone says this... but just be there for him..|`|TxSTwLQUaa	bring him his favorite snack like brownie or cookies. hang out with him tomorrow. maybe buy him a new dog? help him out! he'll enjoy it.|`|mEzVgC7Kaa	Just go over to him and sit with him. Say stuff like, he/shes in a better place now...  just let him know everything lives and dies... God knows what is better for the dog. If it died from illness tell him its better than it suffering.|`|An6hUkqUaa	Not sure there is a way to comfort for man or beast. Just be there for him. Don't try to shove another dog / pet on him. If he was that close, it will take some time for him to decide if he wants to go through this ordeal again or at least real soon.|`|CvAEqpMYaa	Losing a dog can sometimes be as difficult as losing a person, many people feel very connected to their dogs and a loss can be absolutely devastating. just be there for your friend when he needs you, at this point he probably needs a good friend to lean on as he pulls himself together. perhaps some sort of memorial statue/grave or even an urn will help your friend with the grieving process and assist him in moving on. Be sure that your friend doesnt immediately opt for buying a new dog because it is only a temporary fix, he needs time to figure out if another dog is what he needs and an impulse could lead to a dog that he may not actually want or feel connected to. I know you wish there was more for you to do but being a sympathetic ear is one of the best things for a person in mourning. Im terribly sorry for your friends loss and for what its worth, i offer my most sincere condolences, i understand the loss of a dog and it hurts in places many people dont even realize they have...|`|M4hQKg7raa	let it pass, invite him to go out or play a favourite game, watch a cinema, evade things that will make him remember his dog. or juz give him another dog. a K9 will do hehehe, my fav. dog hehe
XK9RLaPeaa	Absolutely not. The dog would either get heat exhaustion, or get too cold. It is a dark, lonely place and a dog should be either in your house with your family, or in another home that will take care of it properly. Why would you get a dog, just to put it in a garage? Thats worse than chaining him up outside (which is wrong also). Find him a good home.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	well, literally yes it physical COULD live in a garage. Would it be the proper life style,no. Not only could this dog over heat cause of its thick fur in a hot room, it could get sores on its elbows and legs from a hard surface. This could also be punished by animal cruelty fines. So my Ultimate answer is no. If you get a dog it should either be outside if the temperatures are mild, or it should be with you, inside, where it can Truly be a dog.|`|AA10112346	No.    Dogs are family members! not some garden gnome.|`|AA11736483	As long as the dog has access to food and water it is fine.|`|GSf09ALBaa	No.  Dogs are domesticated animals.  They need to be with their humans in their home.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	NOOOOOOOOOO but "YOU" can live in the garage instead.

No dog should live in a garage.  They need fresh air, exercise, and to feel part of the family.  You will just be asking for behavior problems to develop if you isolate a dog like that.|`|6EIdLkS7aa	I don't think it would be a good idea,  besides just the fact that dogs are social animals and do not like being isolated and alone,  Huskies as a breed are large and very active and full of energy,  I don't think they'd like being cooped up in a garage.|`|Mw49Vjs6aa	The short answer is yes.    The long answer is that if left isolated in the garage without adequate sensory stimulation you can expect a wide range of behavioral abnormalities, starting with stereotypical behaviors (obsessive pacing, running, chewing, barking, &c), to aggression or defensiveness (either of which can result in the husky attacking and potentially killing other dogs or humans).    Siberian huskies require a tremendous amount of exercise and sensory stimulation to remain both physically and psychologically healthy.  I'd recommend you take up skijoring, bikejoring, scootering, canicross or some other canine sport.  A well exercised Siberian is usually a well behaved sibe.|`|uxq33y1maa	No, those dogs are huge and they have tons of energy. They need lots of room to run or they will become destructive.|`|CvAEqpMYaa	That depends, it cant gain nourishment from the WALLS obviously so daily feedings would be required ( hoopefully you already knew that) Siberians have a VERY thick coat so if the garage is too warm... you should have your dog regularly shaved. Due to the thick coat, a good brush down once or twice a week would probably be sufficient. And since the Husky is trained to have a lot of energy and endurance for sled races, regular excersise is a MUST to keep your dog both healthy AND happy. Be sure your dog has a nice comfy bed ( an old couch cushion or a thick pile of comforters will do just fine) You certainly dont want your doggy pal to get bored or lonely so play with him/her often! and toys would definately be a good idea, but be warned. Because of the huskys cross-breeding with wolves they have INCREDIBLE jaw strength so heavy duty chew toys that wont break are very important, be sure not to buy anything that it can tear apart and choke on. And also, be sure that any hose or rope IS LOCKED SECURELY OUT OF REACH!!!! this is EXTREMELY important because a bored or playful dog may get the hose/rope wrapped around its neck and it can choke! If you are getting a puppy be sure to teach it proper behaviour and house trainging is a good idea. If you wont have too much time to let the dog out to use the bathroom or will be gone for many hours at a time, training your dog to use a litter box works like a charm =) good luck with your little buddy and be sure to read up on the breed =)|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Why on earth would you subject a dog to a life in a garage (which are full of dangers in many cases)...If you have a dog it should be a part of the family and have proper accomodations.|`|eu0VfrrZaa	If you can live in the garage then the dog can|`|Hj0BcHi1aa	Sure could! You could also live in a garage. If you had what you needed, But I would'nt keep poochie in there all day. Might get messy. If someone put you in a garage would'nt you stress out?? Feel like your in jail?|`|322582d735a927f0dbcd0ead5902a454aa	Only if you are going to live in the garage with the dog|`|jLi5DiYdaa	Don't worry about the temperature.The Siberian Husky's coat comprises two layers: a dense undercoat and a longer topcoat of short, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, but the coat also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as ?58 F to ?76 F (?50 C to ?60 C). make sure there is no antifreeze on the floor. Antifreeze smells and tastes sweet and is poisonous. Just use common sense.|`|X0kqaRRaaa	Would you like to live in the garage??|`|uoYrkbSYaa	lol good luck with that. siberian husky are very active. Mine used to jump the fence. they need alot of interaction. i had to give mine away because i didnt have enough time for it. It needs a big yard and lots of attention. You should let it stay in your house(it sheds alot), but give them daily walks! no garage !!!|`|dt8UrgaVaa	It is possible if you are willing to turn your garage into a spare room. Too many thing could go wrong with this situation. A garage that got too hot could kill your dog. The dog could also dart out if the garage door was opened. I suggest a little bit of dog training in basic manners so that the dog behaves himself while he's indoors. It makes life a lot easier with an animal if you can teach him the rules.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,    Siberians are active, they can live outdoors but be sure they are not off leash because they might run away and chase small animals.

mZelbkwEaa	Get all three of them fixed and there should be no problem if you keep a boy or girl from the litter. The reason the other two fought is because they were intact males and doing what nature intended which is  fighting for dominance and rights to the woman. The father is listening to his male hormones fighting to be head of the pack. Just get them all fixed to prevent canine diseases related to there intact areas and help curb the dominance issues the father clearly has.|`|2cf33c92f519e903be6243b0e6edff71aa	Well with the pups at 2 weeks old you can let the dad meet the pups for a bit but not for long. He should be fine with her and he will learn that the longer the pup is there he will be fine. But introduce them slowly and don't force the dad to like the pup right away. He feels that he is not going to get the attention that he had before with a pup in the house. Mom won't mind with a pup of hers that stays. The dad won't mind the 2 females but make sure that when the pup is old enough, get her spayed to because he will try to mate with her as well and then you will have the problem all over again. So when she is about 4-5 months old you should be able to get her fixed.      I had pups from my previous litters and they all did fine with dad and no fighting but just take it slowly and he will  be fine with the pup.|`|HYpEOdsraa	There shouldn't be a problem in keeping a puppy.  I always keep one or two puppies from every litter I breed and have never encountered any problems, especially between the females and the males.  Usually the only reason two males will fight is if they are both uncastrated and that normally doesn't happen until the male puppy reaches maturity and they start fighting for dominance.    I wouldn't advise introducing the Dad yet.  The mother is still nursing her puppies and will be extra protective towards them so she will regard him as 'prey' and could very easily turn on him if he tries to get anywhere near her babies.  A Dam will fight to the death to protect her young.      It would be better to wait until all the puppies are completely weaned before you introduce them to Dad.  The Mother will have done her job then and will be willing to accept him back into the pack.  I never let my other dogs near my litters until they are at least 8/9 weeks old and have had their first jabs.  Better to be safe than sorry.    Good luck with your litter.|`|mEzVgC7Kaa	yes. fine.
mZelbkwEaa	Sweet heart relax is will be ok the amount of chocolate is important and they type of chocolate is important milk chocolate is not deadly. Strawberry ice creams wont do any harm except add some extra calories to hes diet. Sprinkles are harmless colored sugar. Call your vet agian or call another vet in the area for another opinion. If you are still worried call the Pet posion hotline there number is 800-213-6680 and they can futher help you.

They can tell you what to do.  Milk chocolate is not as bad as dark chocolate, but it does matter how much he ate.    If he ate it within the last 15 minutes, you can give a little (like a couple of teaspoons) hydrogen peroxide to make him throw up, but I would check with a vet first.  Some vets may not recommend doing that.|`|HRsfZHWAaa	Ok this is a very dumb question first of all where are your parents at have you told them I am sure some one can take you to take him to the Animal Hospital or Vet and I am wondering why are you asking people on here you have the internet right in front of you where you can look up this **** and find the answer alot more faster that poor dog I hope everything is ok with it
AA11901352	There is no such thing as a fresh water moray eel.  There is a fresh water fish commonly misslabled as a fresh water snowflake GYMNOTHORAX TILE    This eel however is not fresh water and really needs a brackish water tank which may be a bit high in salinity for your cichlids  .  The spiny eel family  like the zig zag, peacock, tire track etc are all broad finned fish that would work well in your tank. You still need to be careful since these fish do eat live foods.  There are no guarantees with these fish with other especially smaller fish in the tank.

Usually it is only places where rabbits have been hanging out, so maybe he's trying to let the rabbits know they are not welcome.  He also flips his water bowl.  If it wasn't for his kiddie pool, he'd have nothing to drink most of the time.    I am convinced that my dog is nuts.  He's a very intelligent dog, but he does some nutsy things.  He attacks the sprinkler - literally - picks it up and shakes it - water gets everywhere (except the part of the lawn that needs it).  Growling, barking, acting like it is a bad guy who came into the house.    I think they're just entertaining themselves.

AA11706151	A vet or groomer can do it.  Some will show you how for an extra fee.  Get a nail clipper from the pet store - you can't use human clippers on them.    With white nails, you can see the quick - it looks pink. Don't cut into that or it will hurt and bleed a lot. You can trim black nails a little bit at a time. You will see the inner core is white and sort of crusty. When the core turns to more of a solid black , you are just about to hit the quick - it will bleed if you cut past that point.     You can get a product called Kwik Stop from a pet store - it's a powder that will stop the bleeding instantly if you do cut too far. It stings a bit, so don't be surprised if the dog objects!    If you don't have that, you can jam the nail into a bar of soap. Doesn't work quite as well. You can also consider using a Dremel tool with a grinding wheel - just don't hold it on too long or friction will make the nail too hot.     One easy way to cut a big dog's nails is to run his sturdy leash through a chain link fence (around the post) and pull him  up snug against it. You pretty much have to use a choke collar - not to choke him, but to keep him from backing out of the collar.Then, just keep clear of his teeth and trim away. Try to make it as pleasant as possible for him - give him treats, don't cut into the quick, praise him when he's not trying to bite you. We did this with the guard dogs that sometimes stayed at our kennel and no one ever go bit. I prefer not to tranquilize a dog unless absolutely necessary.|`|8694e349acd50235e44b47ea36ba2d45aa	All dogs should have their nails clipped if they are not naturally filed down by rocks, pavement etc.  If a dogs nails grow to long they can start to warp the bones in the paws.

If yours doesn't already know it, have her sit facing you, then take one of her paws and say "shake" while you hold it.  Then give her a little treat.  Repeat that over and over and gradually start saying "shake" while holding your hand out, instead of taking her paw.  She will start to put her paw in your hand to get the treat.    Then, once you've got that down, start having her shake, but hold onto her paw for a while and examine her toes.  She will try to take her paw back--just gently but firmly hold onto it for just a second longer so that she knows you will let it go when YOU want to.  Then give her a little treat.  Work up to longer and longer lengths of time, until you can hold each of her two front paws for 10-15 seconds at a time.    For the back paws, teach her "down" or get her in the belly-rubbing mood.  Once she's in the position, hold one of her back paws for a second and repeat as above until she's okay with you holding her foot for a few seconds.    Then introduce the nail clipper.  Let her sniff it, then when you're holding her paw, bring the nail clipper up to touch the nails, but don't clip yet.  Give her treats to encourage her not to resist.  Then clip one nail and give a treat.  Repeat with each nail.    It's a slow process, and your dog may never enjoy getting her nails trimmed (mine doesn't), but she will at least keep the struggling to a minimum because she knows she will get a treat at the end.  I've even accidentally cut the nail quick and made my dog bleed (I felt terrible!), but she still let me treat the bleeding and finish trimming the other nails.    If you're asking about where the quick is, it's kind of hard to explain without a drawing or diagram.  Mainly, the nail has a broad, triangular shape, with a little extra bit on the end.  Cut off the little extra bit on the end, and you can even round off the end if you want.  If you're still unsure, have a vet or groomer show you.|`|c2edd6b872a272fe5250ae73419a874eaa	you can bye dog nail clippers at most pet supply stores. Be very care full not to get them to short if you do they will bleed quite badly. Some dogs have nails that you can tell were to clip them to if yours dose then  the tip of the nail will be light in color and can be cut to were they turn black. if not listen to your dog they will let you now if you are trying to get them to short just be very care full and remember you can always cut more but you can not put it back good luck.

XurYYreBaa	It's helpful if whatever you're using in the litter box is *very* different from their bedding.  Put a few rat droppings into the litter box.  Also, clean their poop out of the rest of their cage frequently so they get the idea of where to go.  Don't "over-clean" the litter box for the 1st few weeks, but always leave a bit of soiled litter.<br>  Whenever you notice one of your rats using the box, give lots of praise & maybe a small treat.  Too big a treat & your little guy is more likely to focus on the treat rather than how it was earned.<br>  We've had mixed success with litter training our rats & it usually does take more time & patience than training a cat or bunny.  On the other paw, it's way easier than litter training a ferret.|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	It can take some rats a week to learn, and it can take others months. And some rats just never grasp the concept. I don't know your current method of litter training, but the one I hear recommended most frequently is to simply place all poops you find in the cage in the litter pan. You also need to use a different type of litter than the rest of the cage. If you see the rat in the litter box, reward it with a treat. You need to be persistent with this. You can't just gather up the poops once a day or reward them once in a while. Eventually the rat will see all the poops in the cage and realize that they need to put the poops there.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions about litter training or want to read up on more information, check out the website below. It is a forum for rat owners. I recommend it to everyone that has rats.|`|nMuDw3Nzaa	Since rats are clean animals it isn't too hard to teach them.<br>  Normally they will poop mostly in one corner.  Put a litter tray or strong tissue box or something there, and put some of the poop and if you can find wet bedding.  Litter --i use cat litter but only a very small amount and small animal litter is better-- can be useful but you don't have to. Once you have enough stuff in the litter tray or whatever, clean out the cage thoroughly. It helps if they can easily distinguish the clean smelling area and the bad smelling area where they go.  Don't make it too comfortable though, or your rats may just fling out the poop and sleep there. that was my mistake at first with stubborn Scorpious.  I lined it with tissue and soft bedding and put the poop there in a nice neat line....then he came in a trashed it so he could curl up, then chewed up the tissue box.<br>  It may take them a little bit, but do the same thing every time you clean the cage, and make sure you put it where they use the bathroom most. Rats have little things on their feet that allow them to mark areas where they walk, and can be territorial and mark half the cage.  So, they may poop there, but you still have to change the bedding. It just makes it easier and less frequent.

There's almost no such thing as breeding your dogs responsibly.  Backyard breeding shouldn't take place.  It lowers the standards of a particular breed.  Leave making puppies to professional breeders who know how to properly pair males and females together to produce puppies that will enhance the breed standard.  Just because the two dogs that you pair up are both AKC registered does not mean that they should be bred together.  Most of the puppies that are sold by breeders are intended to be pets only-not to be bred.  The pups that they sell do not meet the standard of excellence set forth by the AKC and other organizations.  Breeders will keep pups that do meet these standards and will "show" them and breed them to enhance breed standards.  Unless your purebred dog is a show champion, it probably doesn't meet AKC standards and you are furthering "poor" genetic qualities when you breed him/her.    Just some food for thought.....|`|AA11804697	If breeders didnt charge so much, we wouldnt keep breeding our own dogs. I understand what you're saying, I had the same idea when we wanted a puppy.

I say we start having dogs and people spayed? Does that make sense? No it doesnt.

Keep on Keepin on girl. My grandma did the same with her dauchsunds. She loved them all and they all got wonderful homes. She recently switched to toy poodles due to a nasty divorce with her husband who just realized (after 60+ years of being alive) he is gay.

There are MANY backyard breeders who have show quality dogs.  Professional breders sell them constantly!    Why, because there are only so many they can kepp.    Not only that, but it is next to impossible to tell whether a dog will be competitive in shows at 8 weeks!    I have a show quality dog, and he was sold for the same price as the rest of the pups!    In fact, I was going to breed him and the breeder told me that was fine.  In fact, he wanted me to bring back my male dog so he could breed it with one of his females!!!!!    He already had 6 dogs, and couldnt keep any others!!!    As for adoption, I have an English Bulldog.  If you know anything about them, adopting one is a GREAT way of getting a dog that will require THOUSANDS of dollars in operations!    Adopting is NOT always an option, no matter how much you wish it was!

She has an incredible temperment, and only barks when you're walking away from her. I take her for walks everyday, and she runs for the first mile, then "flumps" for the rest of the walk. By flump I mean randomly lying down. She has great eyes, and giant ears that get wet when her water dish is full. Oh, and she's fully grown, but barely bigger than a housecat. Great dog.

2CbfO4jWaa	"If you regularly dust his food with a calcium/Vitamin D supplement, is a special uvb light still necessary?" .....................the answer is no, if you also provide enough usable heat. thats what  basking lizards need to process calcium, not uvb(sorry "mak l") ( "usable heat? hmmm.... what does he mean by that?" ..........well keep asking questions on how to take care of your water dragon the best way! :)  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Is there a difference in the special reptiglo uvb lights and regular spiral (or long) fluorescent you get anywhere else?"................yes. some are good for somethings and others are good for other things. depends on what you need it for.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: hahahahahahah! gotta love the thumbs down. i wonder how successful and how long the people who gave them are in this hobby? step up. lets see where your knowledge/opinion on the subject comes from. my guess is care sheets , hearsay and very little successful long term keeping. you could even e-mail me. any challengers?<br>  <br>  (p.s. im gonna give you all a thumbs up just to prove im a nice guy! hahahahah.)<br>  <br>  im still waiting..........................anyone?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hahahahahahahahah! i cant believe you guys are still debating this. ill clear it all up. yes lizards and snakes use d3 to metabolize calcium, and in very negligible amounts. when a lizard (water dragon) basks they are not only sitting in uv light they are also sitting on SURFACE temps that are WAY higher then what any of you guys are provideing in captivity (130F+) 100F-110F basking spot = very little calcium being metabolized and uv will help make up for that substanderd heating. now give it a PROPER basking spot in 130F range and calcium is being metabolized like there is no tommorrow. the problem with you newbies is you believe anything anyone says is it conforms in some way to your ill informed beliefs. thats why guys like me are knee deep in eggs and you guys arent............ we listen to our animals, not a kid in a pet shop or a care sheet. uv bulbs are gimmick products meant to make you spend. have you ever wonderd why they cant make then last longer then 6 months? my halogen floods last 2 YEARS! and if you read the labels on some they state they could do retinal damage at distances from 12" and below (the same hight they recommend you keep them for "full uvb exposure"). all a crock of crap. heat them right and suppliment the food. the smart, cheap, and most efficient method.|`|wLgGD63raa	Yes, you will still need a UVB bulb, otherwise dusting the food would have no point. Reptiles use the UV rays to process and break down the calcium and vitamins in their system, otherwise it would be a waste of time for you.<br>  <br>  As far as a light goes, yes there is a different between a UVB bulb and just a regular fluorescent bulb. The UVB bulb will get UV rays to your lizard, a plain fluorescent wont.|`|gonBJhGNaa	1. Technically, no, you would not need a UVB source when using a calcium containing vitamin D3. HOWEVER, I highly recommend that you provide the dragon with a UVB source and a "pure" (that is, vitamin D3-free and phosphorus-free) calcium supplement and NOT a calcium supplement with vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 can be overdone when added into the animal's diet - an overdose of vitamin D3 is toxic; if you do not know what you are doing, you can overdo it. Dragons (reptiles) produce their own vitamin D3 with heat and UVB and have mechanisms to prevent overproduction of the vitamin, unlike if they are fed it. This site explains UVB and vitamin D well: <a href="http://www.uvguide.co.uk/vitdpathway.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvguide.co.uk/vitdpathway.htm</a><br>  <br>  Their bodies know better than we do concerning how much vitamin D they require and they will produce the right amount themselves if given a proper environment. So, again, I advise you use a UVB lamp along with a calcium supplement that is free of both vitamin D3 and phosphorus. You can use the calcium supplement with vitamin D3 sparingly, but use the "pure" calcium regularly.<br>  <br>  2. Repti Glo is a brand of UVB lamp by the company Exo Terra, it is not a type of UVB lamp.<br>  <br>  There are three types of UVB lamps:<br>  <br>  I. fluorescent tube UVB lamp<br>  II. compact fluorescent UVB lamp<br>  III. mercury vapor UVB lamps<br>  <br>  I. Fluorescent tube UVB lamps: these are the "long tubes". Good lamps (brands) of this type are:<br>  <br>  -Zoo Med Reptisun 10.0<br>  -Exo Terra Repti Glo 8.0<br>  -Zoo Med Reptisun 5.0<br>  <br>  You can purchase such a UVB lamp online for a good deal less than the typical pet store price:<br>  <a href="http://www.bigappleherp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigappleherp.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://lllreptile.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lllreptile.com/</a><br>  <br>  Avoid the Exo Terra Repti Glo 10.0 - this lamp has been causing health issues in reptiles.<br>  <br>  II. Compact fluorescent UVB lamp: these are the "spirals", "curly", etc.. These should be avoided in general as several have been causing health issues in reptiles - better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  III. Mercury vapor UVB lamps: these are lamps that produce both heat and UVB (I and II do NOT produce heat). An excellent one of these is the ReptileUV Mega-Ray: <a href="http://reptileuv.com/" rel="nofollow">http://reptileuv.com/</a><br>  <br>  An excellent site to check out concerning reptiles, UVB, and UVB lamps is <a href="http://www.uvguide.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvguide.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  <br>  ded65, I did indeed say for the calcium (or vitamin) supplement with D3 to be used, just sparingly as it can be overdone. For calcium given regularly, D3-less should be used, along with a UVB source. And I never disagreed that a UVB source is necessary.<br>  <br>  VARANID, you are throwing around assumptions and names... Careful about it.<br>  <br>  I suppose you are a monitor keeper by your username and what you write? Do you actually keep water dragons? If you do, you are entitled to your own experienced opinion on dragon keeping. However, if you do not, you should not hand out advice about an animal you do not keep. Keep in mind that Physignathus ≠ Varanus.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	UVB is required so the D3 can enter the blood stream and enter the liver. This is necessary to use the calcium.<br>  The spiral (compact) are known to cause damage in some reptiles. Tubes seem to be safer. Some of the Mercury Vapor lamps are the best. You can find a lot of information here:<br>  <a href="http://www.uvguide.co.uk/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvguide.co.uk/index.htm</a><br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: I was just looking over the answer below. Technically, they DO need UVB. They also need D3. The amount of UVB you can produce from any light source does not come anywhere close to what the sun provides. This would be the only instance (if he lived in full sunlight) where you would not need to supplement D3. Try this link too:<br>  <a href="http://www.triciaswaterdragon.com/dragoncr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.triciaswaterdragon.com/dragon...</a>|`|qxkRS4bZaa	yes they use the uvb to process the calcium
AA12213644	I am in the US, so as far as laws and such, I do not know.  But as far as the care and size? I can help and so can this website http://turtleexchange.smfforfree.com .  Ok, the turtle that will probably stay the smallest is a musk turtle.  You will need a tank (about 40 gallon woudl be good), water, basking lamp, uva/uvb bulb for daytime lighting, possibly a heater, depending on how cool it gets in your home.

YOUR FRIEND CLOWMY|`|7a94b08633713812fb94f864517c2134aa	You will need to apply for a licence to keep the turtle, but it's really no prob, as long as you haven't been charged with any animal cruelty offences.  Most pet shops sell turtles and reptiles nowadays, but make sure you have plenty of money to set up the tararium and to buy the turtle.  They need to have a heat source, land and water, and the food varies depending on the species.  I suggest doing a bit more research on the native species of turtles to find out how much work they are going to be.  They will need to get everything they would usually get in the wild from you.    Have fun and good luck :)
95b168c043bba5d5c4a3a646da0b45baaa	We have a shih tzu... Shih tzus hate being in a cage... for one...    but, something you may want to consider... if he has to go potty he will not be able to sleep.  puppies/dogs hate going potty in the same area where they sleep.    he may have to go outside.    dont give him food/drinks a couple hours before bedtime.    put a sheet or something over his cage to make it nice and dark like a "den."    make sure his cage is in a nice quite area.    do not use a bark collar on that small of a puppy at that age!!!!     our shih tzu has always slept in bed w/ one of our family members.  to ensure he does not escape the room, put a leash on him for the first few nights to ensure he stays in your bed.    its not normal, and hes trying to tell you something is wrong.    dont put toys in his cage, make sure he has an area to sleep in while in his cage.  you can pad a shoe box for a bed if you'd like at that age... or a nice blanket or pillow to lay on... no food/water.    let him out as soon as you wake up in the morning.  even if its 6am and you dont want to wake up.    puppies have a VERY small bladder!|`|ded918c1d0f6cb19400f5a93bb98ec81aa	dogs are just like babies. they just wanna be near you. my pup is like yours and i truly understand your feeling. when i leave him in the play pan, he bark non stop and causes me to have such a terrible headache.  maybe you can try leavin his crate near your bedside. just let him feel near you.|`|AA12086491	what do you think happens when you electrocute someone.  Electricity through your body= pain.  Thats the point.  If you zap him each time he barks and if he is as smart as you say he is then he'll get the message that barking doesn't feel good.  Fortunatly the shock collar is just to train him, so once he gets the hang of it you won't have to shock him anymore and he'll only bark if there is something worth getting shocked over.|`|286a92e2a05f2c4aa2f76b3afc0bd048aa	Try moving the crate into your bedroom, it could be a form of seperation anxiety.    As for the bark collar, it does hurt a little (like sticking your tongue on a 9V battery), but the yelp is more from the suprise than pain, don't worry, they're proven to be safe.  He'll bark a few times, and he will stop (they don't like suprises from that!).|`|AA11947327	Put the crate in your bedroom and do not put toys in it.  Put something that you have worn in with him.  Your scent should calm him.  At 15 weeks, he should be able to hold it all night.|`|AA11743503	He's obviously scared of and distressed by the crate and being shut in.  Try getting him used to it.  Try feeding him in the crate and giving him his favourite treats in there, but with the door left open so he doesn't feel shut in.  This will help him develop a positive association with the crate.  As you've found ignoring him isn't helping you need to get him desensitised to his fear of the crate.    Put him in the crate next to your bed at night, try leaving the door open so he doesn;t feel so scared and shut in.  Give him plenty of "positive reinforcement" when he's in there so he can see its a nice place to be and a place where you get petted!    Bark collars are cruel and needn't be used.  You just have to understand why your dog is doing this and help him get over his fear of being shut away from you.|`|16649a74e7372b979fd2de2a1d3607bdaa	Agree completely with ladymoonlight.     Shock collars may stop your dog from barking, but that is just a symptom of their distress. Shocking just creates more distress, it doesn't solve the actual problem.    Many dogs have to be crate-trained, not just crated and expected to like it. It's a little by little thing involving a lot of positive reinforcement and slowly upping the time they are in the crate so they can get used to it.|`|87595ad511de2aef86de524bb3b64d0faa	Maybe he is new to to your home. Give him some time to adjust. Decorate his kennel with toys or things which he likes. Don't lock him up everytime in it. Anyway he is too young. As he grows old he will start liking his own sweet home|`|7055d4f04ecd3f8d8fb0865b691b6f7eaa	Well....shocker collars are debatable...but we use them for our two bostons as an outside fence.  Our yard is a little too large for a fence, and it's on an awkward slope.  So, rather than have them roam the neighborhood, and possibly get hit by a car, we use the electric fence.    We have a remote to it as well, so if they are peeing in the house we can zap them (if we catch them in the act...which is rare.)      I don't think you should use the zapper while your dog is in the cage.  Many dogs think the cage is their "safety" zone.  If you start zapping him while he's in the cage, he won't want to go in there and will probably bark more as a result.    Can you throw a raw hide bone in there with him?  That keeps our dogs occupied. I think both of them whined while they were puppies and in the cage.  They don't like to be alone.  However, once they got a little older they like the cage now.  If we leave the house, and forget to put them in there, we come home and both will be sleeping in their cages.    Good Luck!    What if you let him sleep with you at night?  Just make sure you wake up early enough to let him outside!|`|AA11638849	Well some pups do bark a lot when left on their own. The smart ones tend to do it more often. It's mostly psychological. They don't like being left alone.   It is not advisable to allow him to bark till he gets tired and goes to sleep. For one, the continued barking does not do either you or your neighbours any good. But more importantly, it could lead to health problems for your pet.  I have dogs in my house and I can readily understand what you are going through.  If it is possible, then allow him to sleep near you. Keep the crate near your bedroom so that he does not feel insecure.  If that is not possible or if that does not work, you can try some of these:  *Put him in his crate at a point of time when he's really tired and be there with him till he sleeps and then move off.     *Reason with him. Be firm and say NO when he embarks on his midnight soliloquey. A little bit of scolding will not hurt his feelings.    * Try to see if there's anything near his crate that he is afraid or suspicious of. If he is actually barking AT something...maybe a piece of furniture or a mirror or anything that scares or excites him, try removing it from his sphere of vision. Little pups like our own kids do have an exaggerated sense of imagination.    It would also be a good idea to talk to your vet about it.     As for the bark collar... would you consider using something similar for your own baby, if it had a problem of crying out loud all night whenever you put it in its cot?  Think about it. It's your own decision...after all those collars have been proved to be quite 'safe'.|`|AA12257682	Put a blanket over his crate. That is what we had to do with My dog. He was really yippy. Or have his crate in the person he loves the most's room. He will feel safe there.
8c568b609ac10f8c6a54a5193db8b3a2aa	This is a very tough question to awnser. Since you have seen a vet and you say she/he is knowledgable i would just keep a very close eye on her. I would monitor her eating and drinking and weigh her everyday or every other day to make sure shes okay. If shes holding down water then thats a good sign.  <br>  <br>     But to me those bumps dont sound very good. I know your vet said that they dont have anything to do with the vomiting but that seems very odd to me.

Drinking lots of water then throwing it up?  Your vet has more than likely checked her thyroid which definitely can malfunction in cats as can blood sugar.

Good luck.....|`|TLKTM16Eaa	if she is vomiting, she probably has a hairball. give her wet food it will help. I also use a home remedy of a can of tuna and a little veg. oil mixed in. brush her regularly and if that doesn't help, try a different brand of food. if that doesn't work or makes it worse, maybe your cat is overeating. you can ask your vet the amount of food depending on weight and age. i have a long haired cat and usually she vomits when she has a hair ball she can't get out.|`|oe0Yg1jcaa	Has the vet checked for IBD (Irritable Bowel Disease).

If she isn't acting like she's sick, then she'll be fine.  My 12-year old male cat (neutered and indoor) does the same thing once in awhile, but like yours, doesn't act sick at all.  Getting old sucks.

AA11545298	it won't ever go away, the big thing is if the intestine can fall out of the abdomen and into the hernia then cost or not it needs tobe fixed asap!  the blood flow tohis intestine can be cut off and that will cause the intestine to rupture  releaseing the bowel contents in to the body which wil kill him, if the body contents don't fall into it then you don't need to fix it right now.

Although I did have a female cat with a hernia that was not repaired the time of her spaying, and it never caused any complications to her.  She simply had an outie bellybutton.      I would ask the vet how much more it would cost to have it repaired.  I cannot imagine that it would be too much to have it done.  You could also discuss with your vet what potential problems might arise if you do not have it fixed.|`|f8c8a0e8093e2f73931c14ddc23d86b8aa	Hernias are not terribly frequent in kittens, but do happen.  What is paramount is how LARGE it is.  If it's small it may be able to be ignored (ask your vet).    A spay is not in the same area as an umbilical hernia.  Meaning it still would take 2 separate little operations.  When you neuter this boy, that would still be the case.  The preexam and anesthesia are a major part of surgery, so it may not be as expensive as you think to do them both at the same time, as you had in a female.    By the way, I've been breeding pedigree cats for about 7 years and we've never had a hernia; just consider myself lucky.|`|b3cca9e9cd09dc11b038e82e1f9c9b2aaa	wow..never heard of a kitten having one.. but I assume they will wait until he is a year to see if it goes away.. if he starts to not want to eat or throws up food.. or has strange bowl habits.. then he may need surgery..just like people do.. it should be the same signs and symptoms...and no do not tape a quarter over it to hold it in.. it will do more harm than good.. just incase someone suggests doing that.. if you press it and he whines.. or if you cant push it back in it is an emergency...|`|66e9e301c524bccaf47253283f7871a3aa	Hello you should get it removed as it will not go away on it's own and how i know this my dog which is a Jack russell had the same thing and i thought it would go away, but it didn't nor did it get bigger so i guess it would be the same for cat's too.

AA10327148	That's a no brainer! Continental airlines have a wonderful pet-safe program. I will heartily recommend them any time. I have shipped dogs for many years, but they have never been treated as well as on continental... they actually have pet sitters that never leave the pets.    the only downside, is that they only fly to major airports.|`|7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	Flying is REALLY hard on dogs. They don't get let out to go, they are confused and get jostled around in the plane. If you have to, you HAVE to buy an airline approved carrier, which can be expensive and hard to manage for a larger dog. My 30 lb beagle had to fly a few times and he HATED it. I have to move my 120 lb shepherd across the country and I am driving him. He could never handle the flight and could easiy get injured.    if you HAVE to fly, DO NOT give them tranquilizers, as that can cause them to get injured by being too limp and getting bumped around too much. Read up on the rules for the airline before you fly, and you will need a vet to check the dog before you fly them to verify that they have no diseases or illnesses (a respiratory infection could easily be spread to any other animals on the plane)    I won' ever fly my dogs again. They are confused and alone and it is really hard on them.|`|AA11118066	in my opinion there is no safe airlines 4 pets just drive your dog will be much happier|`|AA12260782	You need to find out if you need a health certificate.  If you are taking the dog out of the state or the country there is paperwork that has to be completed.  Call you vet, they will know what you need.  Also, a lot of this paperwork has a time limit.  Whenever anyone gives you papers, ask how long they are good for.    You will need to plan ahead and ask lots of questions.  You don't want your pet stuck in quarantine that can last weeks and months. Which can happen if the paperwork is not correct.  Flying is safe and probably the least stressful method of transport.  Book a non-stop flight and try to get the same flight.  That way you are right there and you don't have to worry about changing planes or anything.|`|AA11930013	Score another one for Chetco.    If you have to ship your dog,  the most comfortable choice for the dog would be Continental.    I had to relocate after Katrina, and I am now stuck with Delta,  or drive 4 hours each way to Atlanta, Ga. or 4& 1/2 to Birmingham, Al.  Delta has to be  "hands down"  the worst I have ever used.  The attendents dont have a clue and could care less.  When I use them I am on the phone the entire time the puppy is in flight.  They have a very steady habit of changing the aircraft that the puppy was scheduled to ship on to another flight (same destination, just different times)  That would not create a problem except for the fact that they NEVER call the owner or the buyer to inform them of the change.  Of 9 shippings I have had adjustment of some sort that I had to make on 6 of them.  I know it is sometimes impossible to drive a dog to a new destination.  And yes people, I have actually paid people to carry my puppies to Atlanta or B'ham for me.  If you are going to be on the same aircraft as your dog, it might not be as stressful on them, even if they are stuck in cargo.

yANJhWw4aa	First.  Get your cat neutered.  Cause it's hard to say if he's spraying or peeing.  There are spay/neuter clinics where you can get them castrated cheaper.<br>  <br>  Second.  You have to get the urine out of EVERYTHING but the litter box.<br>  Cat urine is full of ammonia and pheromones that draws them back to the same place to go.  You can get sprays that will remove it, the one that worked best for me when my cat started doing it was from walmart.  Just make sure it says that it removes the pheromones as well.<br>  <br>  Third.  Litter boxes must be cleaned.  I never used to clean mine every day, it was in the basement and I didn't think about it.  Turns out that my cat was peeing in my favorite chair because of that.  Well, as far as I can tell anyway.|`|VWRdXmE6aa	get him neutered for sure. it will be a lot better. Hes trying to mark his territory. Which is annoying but true|`|daefJTPGaa	You should get your cat neutered; most likely he is spraying. Male cats spray to mark their territory. The plant thing may be because he dislikes the litterbox. Try cleaning it more often, using a little baking soda to deodorize, never using air fresheners, and keeping the box accessible.|`|7PLOaHnvaa	As stated earlier by another user, get your male cat neutered. I disagree with not using air fresheners. I have a male cat 3 1/2 years old. I had him neutered as soon as the vet said it was okay to do it. I think he was maybe 6 months old. He has never pottied (lol) anywhere but in his litter box, and I use a spray bottle of Febreze. It doesn't bother him and it works well. You must clean out the litter box every day, both for his benefit and yours. This is a duty, and anyone who doesn't want this responsibility shouldn't have an indoor cat. Owning a pet, like having children, comes with responsibilities. My cat, Jonesy, is like my little boy. Well, not little. He's a BIG boy.  LOL!
cX8Th8TUaa	Cats have scent glands along the tail, on each side of their forehead, on their lips, chin and on the underside of their front paws. They use these glands to scent mark their territory. Every time your cat passes by the refrigerator or the sofa and rubs up against it, he is saying, "This is mine. This belongs here. I belong with these things." When your cat scratches your furniture or his scratching post, he is also leaving his scent there from the glands in his paws.<br>  <br>  Your cat will rub up against you and other companion pets for a scent exchange. While depositing his scent on you, he is also picking up your scent, which he will carefully lick and taste off his fur. (And we thought he was just grooming himself!)
AA11436385	they use scent to mark their territory, they have scent glands in the paws and the face, and they use urine to mark as well, it's like leaving a calling card saying this spot belongs to me.|`|PzkGIlPRaa	Cats are animals which will piss on a certain area for example a tree to so when other cats come by they now its his place and if they go near the cat will attack. 
6SdH8k2Vaa	crush the tablet and put it in some vanilla ice cream, that's how i give my cat his kidney medication|`|RVicFEyFaa	You could take her stool sample to the vet without bringing her in.It normally doesn't cost much for the lab test & the de-wormer.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	First off, are you sure you have medication for tapeworms? You usually get that from a vet; the stuff that they sell at pet stores is for round worms and won't work on the tapeworms. Also, tapeworms can pass from one animal to another easily if they are sharing a litter box, so more than one cat could have them, so keep an eye out for those random pieces of "rice" laying around.<br>  Since the cat won't take the pill quietly, you will need to wrap her in a towel and have someone hold her, and then push the pill into her mouth as far back as you can, then hold her mouth shut until she swallows it.  This is usually not fun for you or the cat, thankfully, dewormers only need one dose...|`|q8R3sr0caa	No a cat cannot live with worms. To give your cat the medication you need to tilt the head upwards and drop the pill into the back of the throat, then hold your cats mouth shut and rub her neck in a downward motion. This should work if done correctly. I usually just wrap it in a peice of cheese but sometimes my cat and be picky so I have to do it the other way. |`|pDVDe4p2aa	8 months is not to young for a cat to be pregnant.  Is yours spayed?  Also, not all worms are tapeworms, they may be roundworms which requires different medication.  It is best to take your cat to the vet and also take a stool sample.  The stool sample will tell if your cat has worms.  Good Luck.|`|0wkSf58waa	If you suspect that she has worms you should take her to the vet so that they can properly examine her and maybe force feed her the worm medication.

Get some Advocate Spot On which deals with both worms and fleas and all you have to do is pop some on the back of your cat's neck.

That way you can find out exactly what worms she may have.  Not all worm medicine is the same.  I had a liquid that I had to give my baby for some other worm....so that may be an option, or I know my Vet was willing to give the tapeworm meds for me.  So give them a call...they are usually more then willing to help.  Good Luck!|`|UBnEBiT2aa	The cat needs an appointment with the vet. Have the cat get a shot for tape and ring worms. The cat won`t eat with a tape worm. the tape worm gets large and it will it the cats food. she might starve.|`|nl3jk0FZaa	Do not torture your cat by making her live with worms. It is inhumane.

We don't take her for walks in the winter, only when it is warmer, above 50 degrees.  She tends to come in when she's ready, and that's mighty quick in the winter!  She does have some jackets and sweaters (which she hates) but I don't know that even the extra clothing protects her much from the snow and cold.  Their hair is so short they're practically naked!  Once the weather hits freezing, I'd say she spends no more than a couple of minutes outside before she comes to the door hopping on 3 legs and shaking, ready to go lay on the heater.

AA11559861	Boxers are extremely hyper, hard to train and stubborn. It is going to take alot of time.It is hard to get them to focus because they can't sit still long enough to concentrate.    You may want to get the help of a trainer. And I don't mean the class training that is offered at PetSmart. I mean one on one training that is provided in the home.  Do some research on the breed and see what others have done. Maybe it will give you some ideas.       Good Luck!|`|AA10834586	focus command:  take a small chewy, smelly treat in your index finger and thumb.  take the treat to his nose so he smells the yummy (yeah right) smell.  then, move the treat to your nose kind of towards your eyes and say "focus (name)." this makes your dog focus on your eyes.  you should not be kneeling on the floor.  you should simply be bent over enough to get the treat from his nose to yours and look him in the eyes.  you look him in the eyes for just a moment, this isn't a stare down.  once he looks at your eyes and focuses, then you give him the treat and say "good focus (name). good focus".    this helps tremendously on walks and anytime your dog just isn't paying attention.    this was one of our first commands learned in puppy school at petsmart!    also, never have your dog focus if you're wearing sunglasses or your eyes are obstructed.  it defeats the purpose and will confuse him.    take care!|`|898f20a257695abc9115e62cda6828e3aa	Treat based training methods.  If they can focus on anything it is food. Give a command and continue giving the command until they do what is expected while you are holding the treat in sight. You can assist them with physical touch to complete the task if necessary. Then as soon as they do what was asked, give them the treat and a lot of praise and loving.  Keep trainig, everyday work on training.  Eventually the dog will look forward to the time you spend together to learn new things, get good treats, and lots of hugs and love.|`|60bb7143d028280d2950ecbdffcaa987aa	Most people would tell you to take your dog to a trainer,that can work but you will still have to do a lot of work .    For starters,you need to know your dog and what he\she 'likes to do' ;often,boxers get stubborn they are one of the keen,intelligent dogs.    Be patient and set strict rules : reward the good deeds , punish the bad deeds...and always be gentle . They are beings just like us and can sense everything,so 'communicating' with your dog,making him\her to understand you and you to be understood is essential .    Ooohhh...play with your dog a lot,and spend as much time as possible - boxers are really affectionate and they can get stuck to you.

Chamomile tea works very well, and is safe for her. Dump it out of the teabag, and use 1 teaspoon for small breed, up to 1 tablespoon for a large breed. Mix it in a little canned food, such as Mighty Dog, or Cesar's,  It will keep her happy, but reduce stress. It can be given as needed.

If the dog has an allergy, discovering and treating the allery specifically will alleviate the itch.  If the dog has a chronic skin condition (like eczema or Psoriasis) it may take medication to correct the itch.  Have you dog checked by a vet to determine the cause.    To help make your dog more comfortable before you go to the vet, you can give it a bath in an oatmeal based dog-safe shampoo and feed it an oil-rich diet.  (We give the dogs with dry skin here Flaxseed oil once a day to help improve their skin condition and coat.)  There are also spray-on topical anti-itch products available online.  See www.drsfostersmith.com for some examples.|`|2cf33c92f519e903be6243b0e6edff71aa	now itchy skin can be caused from a number of things, but to try to get under control try batheing him in a mild shampoo like baby shampoo(johnson&johnson), and a mild dog condionorand once you do that, after you dry him use pure aloe vera cream or gel on the itchy spots. you can use the aloe every day till the spots start to go away. i do this for my dogs and it works really good. good luck|`|AA11101428	It can be caused b many different things.

AA11583852	For most types or oral surgery, antibiotics are given as a precautionary measure.  Most of the time teeth are removed, it is because of disease or infection... unless it was something like a broken tooth, I think not giving antibiotics is reason for a malpractice claim.  Keep the following things in mind though, did your vet give you post-op care advice and did you follow it?  Did you have his infection treated at the very first sign and not wait a week to see if it went away?  If you did everything correct and in a timely fashion, you should write a letter to your vet asking that he pay for all of the vet bills related to the incident.  Make it look like a nice business letter and make sure you send it certified mail, it'll cost a few dollars but it gets the job done and lets him know you mean business.  Under the law, there is no compensation for anything other than actual physical loss (bills for treatment or cost of replacement animal in the event of death.)  It's a sick state of affairs but it is what it is.  If the bills are more than the cost of your vets deductible, he is going to turn it over to his insurance company.  The bad thing is that the insurance company is going to take a few months at least to repay the expenses.  In my case it took about a year even though I had a solid case with 7 sources of supporting information; a few from veterinary texts.  Long story though, leg fracture improperly treated with oversized pins on an ESF... short version, when the device was taken off his leg fractured through a pin site within 5 minutes.      If his insurance refused you still have a shot in small claims court (anything under $5k is small claims, no laywers permitted or needed.)   But in court you are going to need to prove your case.  That means doing research; finding reliable sources which show antibiotics should have been given.  Vets are a lot like police and doctors, they don't like to testify or even give statements about eachother.  You will be hard pressed to find another vet to state that in this case your dog absolutely should have be given antibiotics.  If you do, and you can get him to write a letter, you will win without a doubt though.  No matter what, when you write the certified letter to your vet or if you have to go to court, make sure you have SOMETHING other than "I think he shoulda got some antibiotics."  You need to have evidence in your corner or you will never get anything.  And please don't ask me, I'm not licensed and I'm just starting my 3rd year so I'm not qualified to write the letter.  There is a ton of resources both at your local library and online.  If the vet bills were more than $100 after the surgery it will be well worth your time to spend a few hours digging up resources.  I don't know the exact details of your case, maybe your vet had a reason to not give antibiotics, maybe it was just a lapse in judgement (and therefore malpractice.)  If your vet knows he was wrong he will probably help you in your case, he might offer to treat your dog for free or to pay your expenses out of pocket instead of going through his insurance.      It isn't an easy process... write the letter or talk with some other vets (the one who treated his infection?)  and see what they think.  Get their opinions without mentioning a lawsuit or malpractice or anything like that... try askthevet.com or a similar site too.  Like I said, if you get a few sources or one vet to validate your claim you have no problems collecting on your claim.  Good luck.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	if teeth were pulled, the vet probably gave an antibiotic injection before releasing the dog to you.  It is pretty standard practice after any sort of surgery.

But if the dog already had some gum disease which was talked about, noticable, then pulled teeth...one would want to give anitbiotics...yeah.  Do you know if the vet gave your pet any antibiotic injections afterwards?  Get all the facts first.  Take into account the age of the dog, its overall health, etc.  If youre dog is old and in ill health the vet would/should give anitbiotics to help the dog heal.  If it was a young and seemingly healthy dog and only a couple teeth pulled ..probably not necessary for antibiotics.   Dont know all of your facts...so I hope this helps in some way.|`|f464a569517bd592a904db90e83e43c0aa	Our vets usually give antibiotics and pain meds after teeth are extracted.

T6yYgMIUaa	On an 80 gallon tank, I would definitely go with two canisters, one on either side. You want to have the best water circulation possible.

7c000cf444eb1024a5936f1c7f912a15aa	I you decide to go with a homemade diet you have too make sure it is well balanced. Usually it is RAW food that they use when doing a home diet. There are several holistic blends that great foods and are safe. All the foods on the list are commerical foods and use the bottom of the barrel ingredients (lowest grade). All those foods are owned by companies like Protor and Gamble and Nestle etc. Whose main interest lies else where and the dog food is a cheap way to make big bucks.  The foods you listed are not really healthy foods to begin with. I use to use them years ago before I started to read the ingredients and know what they are. Best thing I can tell you is that the Holistic foods are 110 times healthier and safer. Like Innova, Candae, Wellness and the most natural is Life's Abundance)it can only be ordered on line because it is made fresh and than shipped. Read the ingredients, a meat source should ALWAYS be the first ingredient followed by 3-4 protein sources. You NEVER want to see a meat by-product or rendered meat (which can be anything from unwanted animal parts to road kill. You also never want to see BHT, BHA, or Ethoxyquin. All three are carcinogens and are cheap preservatives banned from human foods. A lot of the commerical foods use those ingredients but do not have to list them because they buy their meats from a third party and the third party is responsible to list the ingredients not the dog food manufacturer. If you go to www.dogfoodzone.com they give you a comparison on the major foods. My Lab gets Life's Abundance, Royal Canin Labrador Retriever 30 ( a breed specfic food designed for LAbs and made by a company who has put alot of time and money in their food) They also get Wellness 100% meat wet food.|`|1ce2270f846511c49f8bba8fb58167dcaa	there are mighty dog and alpo canned foods on the recall    make sure your not feeding your dog one of them    also dog biscuits, dog chews, dog jerky, beef sticks, bacon treats are on the recall too (some brands)|`|iAMCza9Saa	mighty dog pouch is on the list just need to check the day codes from the site i have provided.

syH2DpN7aa	Filter carbon is really unnecesarry unless you are trying to remove old medicine or your tank has very high levels of some chemicals. If you are using it for this it will be saturated in several hours. Carbon filters should be replaced, not cleaned or you run the risk of gradually leaching all the adsorbed chemicals back into your tank.    I have replaced the carbon in all my tanks with purigen. I have found it makes my water much clearer. It removes a wider range of chemicals, more of them and it will never leach back into a tank. It changes colour from white to yellow or brown when it needs recharging. To recharge you just treat it with household bleach overnight and put it back in the tank the next day. I haven't had to do this yet in my tank and it has been running like this for 4 months.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	I change mine every 8 but you realy should.

Some brands that have high quality ingredients are Canidae and Natural Balance. Also, talk to your Vet- s/he may be able to get a trailored prescription diet.    To answer the weight question, please get a plan with your Vet. Since your dog has a disease, you MUST coordinate care with a Vet- s/he will be able to tell you parameters on weight. Also remember that things will change for the short term since you just started meds to treat the cushing's disease.|`|owFtvXKuaa	My 13 year old beagle mix loves Canidae (http://www.canidae.com/ ). She eats the all life stages formula. She started eating it around two months ago. She seems more active, healthier, and more muscular then before when she used to eat Purina One.    Canidae is very nutrient and calorie dense, so your dog would probably only need to eat around 1 cup of food TOTAL in a day (Two 1/2 cup servings per day) if she is not getting much exercise.     I'm sorry to hear your dog has cushings, my dog was suspected of having that, however, it turned out to be something else. I would recommend allowing the Canidae to soak in a small amount of water for 3-5 min prior to feeding to make it easier to chew. I also buy about one can of the moist food per week and mix that in to the food.    I hope the cushings disease treatment helps. I know it can be very expensive and nerve wracking to have to deal with all of the tests, vet visits, and urination issues that can come with the disease.    Also remember when switching foods to slowly add it in larger proportions to your dog's current food over a week period to prevent stomach upset. Also remember, no matter how much a vet pushes you to feed it to your animals that Hill's Science Diet is crap food. Its only purpose is its various special formulas to be fed to help pass kidney stones, or for intestinal distress. Many dog lovers I know call it Hill's Science Diarrhea since feeding it to any dog seems to case bulky loose stools.    Also, I recommend to avoid most foods marketed to senior dogs. They are generally high in fiber (which can't be digested) and low in everything else including quality. I am a firm believer in the idea that one should feed high quality food to dogs and give each dog enough to meet its caloric needs. Not feed low quality food to old dogs since they'll die soon anyway. Senior humans eat the same food children do. Senior wolves eat the same animals the rest of their pack do. So why should senior dogs be different.|`|rt3hl9M5aa	Yes I agree with petsmart..    Take this link.. It will direct you to the questions.. cause you might get lost in the site..
tuRnntKtaa	I also have a planted aquarium and what I do it I do not get too close to the plants themselves. I vacuum far enough away from them that they do not get disturbed. I also have a lot of substrate to keep the roots from coming up and breaking off into the vacuum. Just try your best to clean most of it, it's always good to leave a little bit of dirt, you can't have a spotless aquarium!
a2cjwMKcaa	If you are going to cycle the tank with fish in it, then starting tomorrow is as good as any other time.    The trick to cycling with fish is to TAKE YOUR TIME. Not in adding the first fish, just with adding the additional fish.    A couple of cory cats is actually as sensible start, they are reasonably hardy, and if it's only them in a 20gal  they should be fine.    But the tank wont start to cycle for at least 2 weeks, and then it will only be cycled to match the fish you have. So add the extra fish in stages and allow 6 weeks for the full number.    If you can steal some gravel or filter media from an established tank that will jumpstart the cycle by transplanting in some real live cycle bacteria that can then multiply and colonise your tank.    I would not add Otos untill the tank is fully cycled and some algae is starting to grow, They are hard to feed, and dont tolerate poor water conditions which can happen during the cycle.    Some fish you could get, small barbs like Golden or Ruby barbs, Danios, Small cichlids like a Kribensis or Keyhole, a small type of gourami, a bristlenose Pleco or some small loachs like Kuhlis.    Good luck, and take you time stocking the tank and it will be OK.    Ian|`|8owlj2xHaa	The quickest way to cycle a tank is to get some filter media from another established tank and put in your tank.|`|ICzM3T8taa	I don' know if petsmart will carry this but I know walmart does it is called Cycle. It has some beneficial bacteria in it that is supposed to jump start the cycling.    I advise you not to put any fish into the tank for at least a week.    You might like to try a schooling fish like the neon tetras or any other kind of tetra for that matter.    If you don't like the tetras you might like gouramis. You could keep one male and two female dwarf gouramis in the tank. It depends on whether or not you want any other fish.    Good luck.|`|tuRnntKtaa	OK do not rush it. You may not want to hear this but if you want to keep your fish alive do not put them in right away.     Your tank needs to cycle meaning it has to start the nitrogen cycle and be able to sustain itself before it can sustain others.     Put your water in it, turn your temperature to your desired temperature, put the filter in with the activated carbon and let it run for 3 weeks to a month. The water will go from very clear to cloudy to clear again and it may smell during the process. In about a month then add fish. Add them a few at a time and don't go for a $40 fish right away. See if your petsmart has TIgerbarbs on special for 3 for $5. Then when you add them and they seem active for about a week you know your tank it ready to go. Either keep these little fin biters or flush them, then add more fish but a few at a time and don't overstock.     Believe me, from many years of experience it is better to do this. I have added water and fish into a brand new tank before as well and in a few days there were all dead. Just be patient. Make sure throughout the process you are adding water conditioners. I use cycle it sometimes comes in a 2 pack, 1 is a water conditioner the other is a dechlorination. Add the dechlorination to the water when you start it and the conditioner a few days after and when you add your fish.    Look for Penguin Tetras they look very cool.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	The quickest way to cycle a tank, is to add a few fish, wait a day or two, then take some filter squeezings or other filter media from an established disease free tank(preferably from a friend or family member if possible) and add that directly to your filter media.  I've set up all my new tanks and ponds and "instantly" cycled my tanks like that for 10 years now with no problems.      Otherwise, most cycles take on average of 6-12 weeks to complete.  I would suggest not using cory cats or oto cats to cycle the tank with-otos definitely won't make it.  Give it a few months before adding them anyway.  They're a very sensitive fish, some not even surviving the transfer from store tank to your home.    Stress Zyme is junk, as well as anything else you'll find at Petsmart.  I would just throw it out.  There used to be a product called BioSpira that would cycle a tank in about a week, but they've stopped making it.  You may still find it at some smaller mom and pop type of pet stores, needs to be kept refrigerated as well.  Otherwise, there's no other bacteria in a bottle that I would recommend.    I would recommend returning your fish and doing a fishless cycle.  Saves you time and money in the long run.

SFfE6dOfaa	well, i would talk to your vet. My horse got really hot off of any high carb feed, so i talked to my vet about it and she came up with a complete diet for my horse. My horse was really hot and because of that she paced a lot so she lost a lot of weight. At the beginning my vet put her on beat pulp, extruded soy meal, and fish oil. My horse wouldn't eat the fish oil, so we switched to just beat pulp and extruded soy meal. My horse responded really well to this diet, she gets all the nutrients she needs (probably even more) and she isn't hot. She put back on her weight with some extra hay, and now she is great! i think that beat pulp would be really good for your horse. I know a lot of ppl who give it to their horses bc it has such good nutrients. The extruded soy meal might help too. Talk to your vet though, he/she will really help! good luck!|`|Bxewx4afaa	I highly recommend progressive horse feed it has no corn and   that's were your energy comes from. It's not your protein that's   making her hyper it's the corn and/or high energy starch.   We have used this feed for a while now and we don't have any   behavioral problems even in the winter. They really like it.  here is a link about it        http://www.prognutrition.com/EquineProdu...|`|9KVmd9Hzaa	Keep her on the whole grains. NO SWEET FEED! It's hard on a horses system.  I feed oats and barley. Oats tend to make a horse a little bit hotter than barley does. But barley adds the fat to keep the weight on a horse. I give them Majesty's cookies-which have the glucoasamine in them so they get their joint supplement too. They think that they are getting a treat, but it's actually a supplement. (:|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Good hay and beet pulp would work for her.   Beet pulp is a good digestible fiber that is fermented in the hindgut just like hay is, so you don't get simple sugars released into the bloodstream, and you don't get acidosis as can occur when you feed grain starches. You would need the hay analysed to see if any vitamin or mineral supplementation would be needed, but this diet would be good for your horse.  Avoid alfalfa hay, which is high in protein, and just stick to grass hay.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	I just watched an RFD program about this the other day (that's the horse channel on direct tv) it said to feed plain oats and twice as much hay as you would normally feed
Oiabe82gaa	Ha ha, if he hits your horse he's dead...if he lets this go on uncorrected you could end up dead with this horse falling over backwards on top of you...it happens every years to many, many riders!!!  This is one of the worst and most dangerous traits a horse can ever have and in many cases it results in an unridable horse!  My wife's horse tried this with me last spring, only once...he got my fist between the ears, that soon stopped him!!!  I hope for your horse's sake that this guy does get this corrected!  I suggest you don't watch when this guy comes to do what he does.  I would recomend you riding out in a standing martingale on nice and snugly, as your horse improves you can losen it one hole, if he relapses start right back on the tightest again. Your horse will soon realise that it isn't good to try to rear!!!  Good luck!|`|IMPvzBk1aa	A horse can still rear wearing a martingale, and is more likely to fall on you with one on, so definitely don't use one.  By leaning your upper body weight forward during a rear, while loosening your reins, the horse can be brought back down.  Once firmly on the ground, leg the horse laterally to disengage the hindquarter, and then work on a circle.  If you are not confident in your ability to do this, you shouldn't ride until someone else has dealt with this behavior and solved it.|`|6j4igZ9Haa	Martingales wont make a bit of difference with a rearing horse. I suspect who ever it was you've been talking to might have meant something else... Let your trainer see what she's like before you go changing or adding things with her tack. Maybe ask her to come over if you can't get to her. Have her physically checked out by the vet, back, teeth etc. Have the tack fitting checked. DON'T be riding bareback it's probably not tack related but you have to check everything before you start getting tough. It could be something she's just learned to do to get out of work. Could be anything. Just don't try and deal with the issue on your own, you could get hurt.|`|vaulPrAmaa	carry an open water bottle (full) when you ride and when your horse rears smack him on the top of the head - he'll feel the impact (horses are tough, it wont hurt, just surprise him)  and feel the water down his head and think he hit something.  It'll scare him enough that he wont want to rear again.  If you are still having probs continue with it.  be firm - horses are tough, they can handle being hit...by hit I DONT MEAN ABUSED!!!!    also martingales stop head thrashing not rearing or bucking - I know from expirience  :P  and don't ride bareback on a rearing horse you'll get hurt|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	order this book from ur local library, it does wonders:) amazing how good it did with my horse, i leanred so much from it:)  The Horse Behavior Problem Solver  By: Jessica Jahiel      hope you get it, it is worth it:)|`|jQvT6k7raa	Well, yes, you could use a martingale for safety, but it doesn't fix the problem.   What you really need to do is break the habit all together. And that is NOT done with a whip, or punishment, or hitting her with a water bottle! That only scares her out of doing it. You need to figure out why she's rearing, and then correct it. That's the only solution that is sure to work 100% for the rest of her life.  Rearing is certainly very dangerous! And flipping over is the largest concern. A martingale would give you more control, and would, ultimately keep her from getting to a full rear, so you can use it, but ONLY as an OCCASIONAL AID! Do not use it 100% of the time for more than the first month and after that no more than 30% of the time, regardless of her improvement.   Here are the common reasons a horse rears, in order of likely hood:  Pain: The most common reason for a horse to rear, buck, bite, or kick,  is pain. Check your tack. does the bit fit her, is it too harsh? Does your saddle fit well? Is everything well adjusted? Perhaps she had some back or leg injury, and it hurts to be ridden. When does she rear? Is it just random (suggesting tack, or a back injury) or is it only during a certain activity? Only at the trot, only when jumping, etc..This suggests it is a leg injury.    Confusion/Frustration:  The most commonly heard of reason for rearing is mixed cues. if you cue her forward while holding her back (be it with your reins, of that you body restricts hr in another form) you are essentially telling her to rear. Do you give her a loose rein, or just gentle contact? Does she naturally hold the headset you require? If this the problem, change of bit, and using more gentle cues should help.  Fear: Horses will rear out of fear, but only once in a blue moon, not every ride. I think we can rule this out, unless she is truly afraid of you, but that seems unlikely.    btw, the martingale attaches to the cinch, so it's impossible to use one bareback.|`|LLuowKqaaa	If you are thinking of riding bareback just what are you planning on attaching your martingale to??? A martingale is a piece of tack that helps to keep the saddle in place...so the bare back thing has me confused.  I would suggest that you wait for your trainer to show up and go from there.  Ask the trainer any and all questions when he is there, that is what you are paying him for.|`|d7cCWJCoaa	Rearing is a very serious and dangerous vice that should be dealt with by someone experienced. Firstly, the cause of the rearing needs to be uncovered. I would love to tell you what's causing it, but without seeing what's going on that's impossible. Can you describe EXACTLY what happens when she rears? You talk about using a more gentle bit- does she rear when you use your reins, when you slow her, etc?  You also need to look a pain issues- get your saddle checked, get her back checked out, get her a massage/chiro session, etc.  Or is this get objecting to moving forward?  If you post more information I can give more advice. You can also email me if you want to discuss it further.    And to answer your question, no, martingales are NOT used for correcting rearing problems, nor is it used to keep your saddle in place like another poster said. There's two types- a running and standing martingale. A standing martingale attaches to the noseband, and a running martingale attaches to your reins. Both help to keep the horse's head down (and the running martingale allows them more freedom). And as someone else said, do NOT hit her between the ears!!!   To rear, a horse needs to stop with any forward momentum they have. You need to put your leg on, and turn them to one side. Hitting them over the head will just cause fear.|`|ZTCspx5saa	Please do yourself a favor take your horse  to someone experienced. Also do not ride him/her bareback u may get hurt. But on the other hand if you can ride him bareback you are in top condition. Martingales will help|`|FcR8G8hPaa	For your horse's sake, do not take any advice that involves hitting your horse on the top of the head with anything. Also, a martingale will not solve your rearing problem, since a horse can certainly rear even with a martingale on.    Rearing is a problem with a horse who is shying away from something. The solution is to slack rein and immediately and firmly drive the horse forward. If you can do this, it will have to bring it's feet down. Then immediately resume your work, ideally by commanding a couple of turns.    Since you know the horse rears do not ride her bareback. Ideally use a western saddle if you are riding this horse.    Try to identify the (usually fear based) cause of the rearing. For instance, a sharp noise, another horse, a scary corner of the arena... Also try to determine if you are holding the reins too tight. Unfortunately, if the horse has successfully engaged in this behavior before, it may simply be repeating the behavior with no obvious cause. This will be harder to get rid of.    Horses which successfully rear are much more likely to repeat the behavior. Anyone who rides this horse must be able to firmly deal with this behavior or it will quickly escalate to a point where only a professional horse trainer can get rid of it.    Good luck and be careful.|`|rb71Fisfaa	I would say that driving a horse forward while he has his front legs are in the air will simply push his hind end under his front causing him to topple over backwards...simple physics!    A horse can't rear if he is wearing a standing martingale, it stops his head from coming up, thus giving him NO momentum to get his front end up in the air!    I say let this guy do his thing and don't watch!!!|`|EQvAbyvcaa	There is a real problem here.  Best advice, stay off this horse until you find out what is wrong.  You say you have someone coming to help you that is known by you to be abusive - are you kidding???  Your horse will have more problems after he comes than she does now.    She could have a physical problem.  Has she been checked out by a vet???  Forget about mechanical devices.  Train your horse instead.  Training lasts forever.  Mechanics does not resolve anything and most devices impair your horse's ability to balance themselves.  I do not get the martingale/bareback comment.  Doesn't make sense.  Sounds like you do not have much knowledge or experience.  Get some proper help for yourself and your horse.  Take care to avoid getting hurt.  Again, if she rears every time, don't get on!!!

If your spitz is nearly in heat and you haven't decided whether this breeding is a good idea yet, you should probably let this heat pass.

People devote their lives to pure breeding so that other people will know what they're getting when they buy a puppy.

Even purebreds end up being killed in shelters because there are so many.  Please get your dog spayed so she doesn't mate with your dachshund.  It's a good idea to get your dachshund neutered, too.  If you want to see exotic mixes, go take a tour of your shelter - you may find some very adorable ones that need a good home.|`|AA10909876	Please don't backyard breed your dogs.  We have millions of dogs that are unwanted and are in shelters!  Many dogs die everday because there is no home for them.    Breeding your ***** will greatly increase her chance of cancers, uterine, mammary, etc.  Leaving your female dog unspayed greatly increases the chance of mammary cancer with each estrous cycle they go through.    Puppies may be born with genetic defects and will most likely have hip dysplasia since this is very common in dachshunds.  Also bloodlines of the sire and ***** may not be very clear and temperment of pups can not be predicted.    Remember proper puppy care is very expensive.  Expect at least 500 to 1000 dollars per puppy for vet costs and also vet costs for the *****.  Vet costs may be much much more if the pups are unhealthy or if a c-section needs to be performed.  Unhealthy pups is often the result of backyard breeding and should be expected.    Breeding dogs is a very difficult process in which both parents and there bloodlines are carefully considered.  Please leave breeding to the professionals that want to breed for confirmation and temperment.  Most breeders rarely make any money.  They usually breed because they love a specific breed and wish to continue the bloodline.|`|52N8QXHmaa	I do not feel you should mix any breeds together.

CqtfXUnMaa	Just because you live in a small home or apartment doesnt mean you cant have a dog. There are many small and toy breeds that make excellent pets for small homes. But even small dogs like variety and exercise, so it is important that you are prepared to spend time with your dog, take her for walks and ensure that she gets the best care. Once you have made that commitment to yourself, you can choose which breed of dog is most suitable to you and your lifestyle.    Small dog breeds make the cutest puppies, and one of the cutest small dog puppies around is the Maltese. This popular small dog breed generally grows to no more than six or seven pounds in weight, and has a beautiful white coat. The Maltese is a very ancient dog breed and has a strong constitution, though it should not be kept in very hot areas, due to the thick coat. The Maltese enjoys walks and is very playful. A great companion if you want a lively little pet and will enjoy the grooming chores.    Another delightful long haired small dog breed is the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. This lovely small dog is as courtly as its name and weighs about twice as much as a Maltese. The King Charles is a friendly and sociable small dog, well known for giving a lifetime of loyal attachment. This is the ideal dog if you prefer to lead a quiet life.    Top of the line in long haired small dog breeds is the Lowchen, as long as you enjoy spending long hours brushing, and dont mind the hefty price tag. The beautiful `Little Lion dog can cost around $1000. A true indoors dog, the Lowchen is no exercise fanatic but owners have reported `separation anxiety to be a problem, so dont get this dog breed if you are away for long hours every day.    If you want a pet with a shorter coat, try the Miniature Fox Terrier. This lively little dog will need lots of exercise, and appreciates having a collection of toys. Fox terriers can be yappy, so your pet may need to go to obedience school if she annoys the neighbors. This is a healthy and low maintenance dog breed, suitable for the owner who just wants to enjoy having a pet without all the grooming fuss.    A more sleek and elegant short haired pet is the Italian Greyhound, and if you want a pet that enjoys exercise, this is the dog breed for you. Owners report that the Italian greyhound is a very well behaved dog, but prone to stress, so it is not a suitable pet where there are small children. This dog breed grows to a height of about 15 inches but is very lightweight  around 5 pounds.    The Welsh Corgi is one of the classic small dog breeds, and very popular with Queen Elizabeth II of England. They will be popular with you, too, if you want a playful, affectionate pet. The Welsh corgi comes in two breeds, the Cardigan and the Pembrokeshire. The Pembrokeshire is smaller and more popular than the Cardigan, but both make faithful pets for small homes.    Finally, there is the ultimate small dog breed for apartment living  the Toy Poodle. Naturally popular in Europe, the toy poodle is somewhat high maintenance regarding its fluffy coat, but a surprisingly undemanding pet. Toy poodles love to play and appreciate having their own toys, but they are easy to train and adapt to their owners. Like most pets, the toy poodle prefers company to being left alone, but if you spend a lot of time away from home, perhaps you should think twice about getting a pet anyway!

A lab would need a lot of space, though, since they are pretty big.    |`|Nrh7m94Taa	a tiny one! it would be perfect.   take good care of  it....|`|X1OIohQDaa	Please make sure before you get a dog you find a good vet who will  help you to look after your pup.  You should be aware of the different costs that come with different breeds.  Also some breeds are more predisposed to some problems more than others.      If you really want some good advice you'd start to look around your local shelters to help re home puppies.  The amount of puppies that are dumped over the Christmas period and the following months after is horrific.     Pretty much most dogs are playful, but depending on your ability to handle dogs and previous experience you should get something that is not too energetic unless you are a serious runner.  Bored doggies in smallish yards will destroy everything.  I suggest to go to google and find a breed selector.  This will really help you to determine what is best for you.  Although these are only a few factors for choosing a pup.      Good luck with your search and I hope you and your puppy love each other for ever.  |`|Wl4KmUZQaa	I have a half chihuahua and half jack russell terrier. He is very playful and small. He is super playful bc of the jack russell so maybe u should get that.|`|GSYRmtMBaa	Get a Yorkie!!    They are cute, don't shead, and very playful!|`|5pTjMDl5aa	shih tzu....  They are very affectionate, cute, and friendly dogs. They are also very playful.They dont bark much so your neighbors wont get upset. They also don't really shed. Mainly I just love their friendly and fun-loving personality! I have one and all my neighbor love her too and they always stop me while we take walks so they can pet her and she loves the attention!  |`|OmRxIg8Baa	Well all puppies are playful but they can be a lot of work especially during the holiday season since you would have to potty train it and make sure its growing right and at about 4-5 months they start losing their baby teeth. You also have to get its shots and depending on its age you may have to go back 2-3 times since most places will not give puppies a rabies shot until they are a certain weight or age...  I would suggest getting a older dog maybe one or two from a shelter cause most will be fixed, microchipped, and already has its shots....  Beagle, lab, jrt, etc. check out petfinder.org or dogster.com    congrats and good luck|`|bdG9i0tQaa	I'm just so crazy about chihuahuas!  they are easy to take places, smart, loyal, affectionate and cheap to feed!|`|xDIpP9pTaa	There are several dogs that are great. First off, a Shih Tzu is a great dog. My friend has a Shih poo (a cross between a Shih Tzu and a poodle) and he is an active, hypoalergentic dog.          I have a beagle, who is adorable and can be very active, although, beagles bark a lot. Dachsunds are a good dogs, but are not a great family pet because sometimes they bite.          Another one of my personal favorites is Jack Russell Terriers. They are playful and and ful of energy.          You can look up dog breeds and some sites will have them listed with links to their descriptions like http://www.justdogbreeds.com/dog-breeds.... .          The best way to get a dot is to adopt or rescue it. There are thousands of dogs who don't have a home. My dog was rescued and he is very sweet and lovable.  Good Luck!|`|us9V4FKYaa	I have a Beagle , and he is smart and fun to play with, we have similar sized areas for him to go out in.|`|dQphuuEPaa	French bulldog.  Frenchies are very energetic and small|`|EZ9DXpgsaa	 a golden retriever, or a yorkie they're so cute!!!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	I suggest a Maltese or Border Terrier, they are playful, smart, they like being brushed and get attached to you fairly quickly.  The 2 I have had adopted through rescue are just the dearest of dogs.  Look at www.petfinder.com put in your zip code and find dogs that have shots and ready for new homes.|`|fbbb1919a6be870cfe6b62811bef94cbaa	A Jack Russell Rat Terrier sounds ideal for your situation.

I have one and hes just the best.|`|aqdDFdm8aa	Boarder Collies are really smart and so sweet, also a lab would be a good choice also.

She is excellent! She has lots of energy but she learned quick too. I wouldn't recommend small dogs because with my experience they have attitudes!  :)|`|2B0qui2Eaa	first when you get your dog adopt it from the humane society (those are the dogs that are really in need) and u should get a dachshund they are very loyal and sweet or maybe a mutt Good Luck and hope this helps.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Get a dog based on your energy level, if you are active and you love to run and bike and hike then a lab, dalmatian, boxer, weimaraner would make excellent dogs.  If you are a couch potato and you groan at a walk around the block then stay away from any high energy breeds or small breeds like jack russell terrier, Rat Terrier [terrier breeds are high strung].  If you select a mix then research both breeds it's mixed with to find out the type and temperament of the dog.  And DO YOUR HOMEWORK and research the dog BEFORE it comes home.  So many dogs end up in the shelter because the person didn't understand the breeds needs and requirements and the dog became too much to handle because they didn't realize how much exercise a dog needed - hence when Dalmatians became popular after the movie and then all ended up in shelters because they got them because they were cute and didn't bother researching the breed.    And please wait until after Christmas to bring him home, Christmas day is too overwhelming and stressful for a dog, it can get into things, eat stuff it isn't supposed to get let out accidentally by a guest and stepped on.  Wait until the holiday craze is over and then bring him home.|`|C6ETOQfvaa	gray hound|`|GAmlREmsaa	Check your local animal shelter before shopping at pet stores.  |`|pUVDhlveaa	a poodle.  a dead poodle.  a monkey  poodle.|`|smdtoo83aa	BEAGLE  BEAGLE  BEAGLE  BEAGLE  BEAGLE  pretty pretty dogs with big hearts and cute and also playful.|`|CubKN59Taa	Weimaraner.

nnLr0jO5aa	Make sure you cycle your tank if you haven't already!!! This is very important!!!  I am assuming that you are talking about tropical freshwater fish.     Some good fish combos would be:     1  2 Dwarf Gourami (1 male and 1 female)  4 Oto Catfish      2    5 Tetras  4 Shrimp (Cherry or ghost)     3   3 Guppies  3 Shrimp  3 Otos     4   1-2 Killifish  4 otos   1 Snail     5   4 Kuhli Loachs  3 guppies|`|sREBdx35aa	a school of Zebras, White Clouds or Neon's would look nice    http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Aquar...|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I would recommend a single dwarf gourami, and maybe a school of small tetras.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	No you can't keep clownfish they are saltwater fish and also not appropriate for a 10 gal aquarium.    Appropriate tropical fish for a 10 gal would be a school of 6 small tetras such as neon, cardinal or  von rio (flame)  or 4-5 male guppies or male platies or a single male betta  and a small school of 3 pygmy cories (pygmy stay under 1/2")|`|36uSy18yaa	well if you want tropical fish, those don't include, clownfish, dory's, pufferfish, etc. because they are salt water fish, if u want salt water fish you need at least a 70 gallon tank and you'll need to buy salt. Some good tropical fish are tetras, mollies, platies, guppies (what you'll need is everything u listed, if you want, gravel at the bottom, filter, thermometer, food)    Also..Goldfish are not tropical fish and can't be put with tropical fish or salt water fish, can only be put with other goldfish or koi
UeCIiv3Zaa	spit on them! i swear it works|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Buy some good black shoe polish.  Use a towel to SPARINGLY apply it evenly in a thin layer, then use a clean towel to buff.  In case you don't know, buffing is rubbing back and forth fast across the area.    Don't do this on the inside of your boots though.  Only the outside and toe.    Good luck!|`|mAZi1eH7aa	Clean them off well with a window cleaner or other spray or pump cleaner. This will remove most of the present shine. Not a heavy cleaning, just a light cleaning. Let them dry.  Take a soft cloth, cotton is preferred (a baby diaper is the best), and wet it. Wring it out till it is as dry as you can get it. Put your boot on one arm and with the other dip the cloth into the polish and rub the polish in with the other, in circular motion. Keep rubbing till it is almost dry. Keep doing this for the entire boot. Do the same with both boots obviously. Then rub the boot again with a soft dry cloth, the same way. After that is done they should look pretty good. If they still are not quite what you want, then a second coat may be needed. This is how we did it with our dress boots in the Navy, and they looked like a mirror finish. Always use a semi soft polish and not the cheapest one. By doing it this way, they will have more scuff resistance and the finish will resist cracking with wear too. Try it. You will like the results, and and oils from the horse's coat will not wear the finish either. The first time doing this will take about an hour, but after that, they will shine up easily, using the same methods.|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	Spit!|`|Oiabe82gaa	If they are Leather boots it's simple; Boot polish, brush onto your boots and allow to dry! Using a soft polishing brush, buff the boot using  plenty of elbow grease. The faster you buff, the shinier they'll be!  If they are rubber boots it's simply soap and water and hope for the best!!!  Good luck!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	You can either pay someone to shine them, or you can follow the below steps. This will make your boots look like they're patent leather and you will be able to see yourself in them.    Start by cleaning your boots using saddle cleaner. I use my Passier cleaner because it's supposed to be safer for the leather than the Kiwi type and it also conditions at the same time.    Once your boots are CLEAN AND DRY you can begin with the next step.    Kiwi makes black polish called Parade Gloss. If you don't have a military installation around, chances are good you will only be able to find the regular black polish, which is fine. DO NOT use liquid polish!! EVER!!!    Did I mention that your fingers will be black and you're going to reek of shoe polish?    ONLY APPLY WAX TO THE FOOT OF YOUR BOOT. The leather up top is not the same so not only will you not get the same shine but you will get polish all over your saddle and your horse.      In the shoe kits there is a small application brush. Don't use it. Use cotton balls in circular motions until the area you're working on is completely covered in a thin film of wax. There should not be any big gobs. Wait until it dries (becomes cloudy looking - 5-10 minutes). You can use a lighter or a hair dryer for the next step. Be very careful not to linger too long in one spot. You want to heat the wax so it melts then move onto the next spot. There isn't enough for the wax to drip, it will just become shiny for a moment.     Once you've heated your applied wax breath on your boot, like you would breath on a window you want to draw on. Using another cotton ball and your breath go in circular motions to polish the wax. Your shoe polish kit also has what looks like a grooming brush in it. if possible buy the separate buffer brush - the bristles are longer and softer and will give you a better shine. Make back and forth swipes on your boot quickly to buff the wax.    Repeat that step, except after you've applied the first layer of wax spit on it before you buff it around with the cotton balls. Then buff the boots with your brush. If your boots do not have a glossy enough finish to reflect color, buff and buff until you can buff no more.    Third step is clear shoe polish, which is sold anywhere. Apply the clear polish with cotton balls and spit only on the heels and toes of your boots.     Heel and sole dressing. Now I'm sure your noticing the soles of your boots look kind of dull and old next to the shininess of your boot. This product comes in a bottle and is liquid. Make sure you use it over newspaper or a drop cloth because it will stain anything it touches. Follow the directions on the bottle to very carefully touch up the outer edges on the soles of your boots.    On show day bring a pair of pantyhose with you, just a small piece. If you get a scuff or any dirt on your boots just stretch the panty hose out and buff the spot. The dirt will actually help the boots be shinier (when I shined my show boots I went tromping around my trainer's indoor to get them dusty so I could reshine them) after buffing and your boots will look great all day.    Btw, Ariat has a great fleece lined boot bags with an individual pocket with each boot. If you're going to spend the three to five hours shining your boots, I recommend you invest.
DqOkUgVsaa	hey buddie sorry but i :"""Heard""' that goldfish needs 20 gallon fish tank....but i recomend only 1 but i can get away with 2 soo only 2 will be the max|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	none, goldfish get to big. You could however put some neon tetras in there and some zebra danos, they look cool|`|bDPVRtCNaa	None. A single fancy goldfish requires twenty gallons, and every additional fancy goldfish needs ten more gallons.    You should not keep fancy goldfish in an outdoor pond.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	None. Even one fancy goldfish needs a 20-gallon tank as an absolute minimum, and 30 gallons or more would be a lot better.    You're probably thinking of the baby goldfish often sold in pet stores, but they soon grow to be almost a foot long.|`|0wTCIlYcaa	the minimum for about 5 goldfish is a 55 gallon, well filtered, frequently water changed, tank.    in an unheated 10 gallon tank, i recommend white cloud mountain minnows. hardy, cheap, and very pretty.    a fish bowl is a torture chamber for any goldfish.|`|849629e19a687a77ac702820eac856f0aa	For every inch of goldfish you should have two gallons of water.  I started out with 1 inch (feeder) gold fish about 6 years ago he is now about 7" long and is in a 10 gallon aquarium! I really should buy a 29 gallon aquarium!!! Gold fish can live to 20 years and grow to 10 to 12" long! Call you local pet store they will be happy to help you.|`|KOxFs52jaa	I would say about six when the start to grow I would get a bigger tank!!!!|`|4ETXtp90aa	Well, fancy goldfish usually do not do well in ponds. To put it in a more "accurate" way, they DIE in ponds. Fancy goldfish just can't compete for survival in a pond, they are meant for tanks. But go ahead and put them in the pond because you really want to, so just block my answer out of your head, convince yourself that you are right, and I am wrong, and kill your goldfish the first 2 weeks they are in a pond.
Bz7jjtFgaa	my 7 year old miniature poodle does that too.  he has for as long as I can remember.  the vet said that it could be an allergy or just a nervous habit.  he has very sensitive skin and I think it may have started as an allergy and ended up as a nervous habit.   I've tried everything to get him to stop.. I've sprayed his paw with that sour apple spray, and my groomer suggested using Gold Bond powder on his paw.. it will help the itch and they don't like the way it tastes.    personally, I've given up hope of ever getting him to stop, the hair on his legs is always shorter in those spots than on the rest of the body, he will never be able to have a proper puppy cut because of it.  but I don't know what else to do besides getting him some puppy prozac!  if you find something that actually works, let me know.|`|rQeAhprcaa	We had a shih tzu & he had very bad allergies. He actually went through allergy testing & was allergic to... Human Dander! We had to bathe him with special shampoo about once a week. He'd start licking himself more frequently when it was getting time for another bath.  Allergies are very common in the shih tzu breed.|`|3afb1a9998ec7ae77d5dc07fa7abfe2aaa	First I would suggest to ask a vet -- best always.  Sometimes it is because there is something on the carpet he likes to lick off his paws or there is something on the carpet or floor that irritates his paws - like a serious cleaner.|`|5139PTTmaa	check for grass seeds my maltese does that as well|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	he could  be allergic to the grass outside or  something that is being used on the carpet at home.  i would take the dog to your vet and  have him or her  give the dog some medician to help stop the itching|`|20d47f2ccf9c2200d0d2156dcf8f1fe7aa	I have heard that some dogs do this out of boredom. Take him to the vet and make sure he is fine medically. Then maybe get him started in a new activity that will give him something else to focus on. Take him to the dog park or take a new dog class like getting certified as a canine good citizen, which is required if your pet works as a therapy animal for hospitals and nursing homes.|`|ee924070953658265c515090c8cc5139aa	I have one also. She will lick her paws if they haven't been brushed and feel tangled. I think sometimes she is licking for left over food, other times for the sheer joy of licking and of course the main reason I feel is she just plain wants to annoy me(grin) A Shih tzu sure is an opinionated little dog but you can't help but love them. If you are truly concern take her to a Vet to make sure all is well with her.|`|ae108db02c12ef58e1d75f3c981eba34aa	Before you take him to your vet you might want to take him to your groomer.  Maybe he has hair between his toes that is bugging him.  Your groomer can take a look see and see what is wrong. .  It might be simple as a hair cut.|`|AA10840953	He might have a hotpot, where the paw is very itchy.|`|9At9yKDDaa	This won't help you at all, but my Lhasa Apso used to do that too. I wonder if it's a nervous habit.    I miss you, Magic.|`|e45ef5dd2557020ba93a7f67e360db07aa	it can be a skin irritation. I forgot the name, but if its that serious, something can be wrong. Take him to the local vet and get it checked immediatly. I'd rather take him and nothing be wrong than to not take him and its something harmful.|`|iSu3ve5baa	If he has that much fur on the bottom of his paws it may be bugging him try getting him groomed|`|AA11896942	My lab did the same thing.  She developed an allergy to something, which can happen in adulthood, and she licked and chewed her feet constantly.    Take your dog to the vet and talk about how you can find out what he's allergic to.  The vet will probably suggest a "food trial", where you transition the dog to non-allergenic food, and don't give him any treats or anything other than the prescription food.  If the foot-licking stops, it was likely something in the food, and your vet can advise you on whether to stay on the prescription food, or just switch to another brand you can get at the pet store.    Or your dog could've developed an allergy to grass, if you take him for walks on grass or if he plays on your lawn.  The vet can help you figure that out and give you treatment options for whatever it is.    My lab eventually had to get a prescription medication.  It costs a fortune and is only partly covered by our Veterinary Pet Insurance, but at least she's stopped licking her feet.  I imagine the itchiness must've been torture for her, so at least she's comfortable now.    Good luck!|`|okoYnwlpaa	that usually occurs because of stress related experiences.try figuring out what the problem is and fix it before he is hairless.once the problem is fixed he will be an all-fur dog!

b3c8c40c4d75752e61d4452f24be7e14aa	I would do about a 25% water change in the new tank with some of the old water, it already has the proper amounts of required bacteria and nitrates that he is used to.  Make sure that your water temperature and ph levels are about the same in both tanks before you move it.  If you are having trouble with nitrate, nitrite and ammonia you should probably invest in a bigger filtration system.  Don't use and under gravel filter catfish like to dig in the mud and rocks that could hurt him, an out of tank filter would be your best option.  Good luck|`|ebec17f29fbb843e3ecf553ba7f60499aa	I would say without any specific change to the new tank's environment. Won't he "let off" some ammonia himself due to the stress when you move him? That should increase it. Can't you transfer a large amount of the water from the old tank to the new tank?|`|AA11906588	I would transfer most of the water from his old home to the new.  The fill the rest with clean water (take the chlorine out of course)     That would be the best way and it wouldn't stress him that much!|`|7a3fd3d79500b60a148039f9e181a31caa	or even just put the catty in a bucket with his water and slowly add some of the new tanks water to the bucket, say over a period of 1/2 an hour ,  he will be fine by then....  dont forget channel cat fish are strong fish and can handle alot.  good luck  G    Ps: add his fav hiding place to the new tank and he should settle in well, and they say  have the light off at first..

eec61b9791496ca2bff48e78593ac3beaa	Best thing you can do is get a book or two about raising budgies.  They need grit, not sandpaper.  Books will explain this, plus what the nutritional requirements of your birds are, how to make them happy, well adjusted, etc.  Plus how to train them, including how to talk.    BTW, only a small percentage of budgies ever speak.  And only a small percentage of those ever get more than a word or two.  But that tiny fraction of budgies that become good talkers become the best in the world.  The world record holder for birds with the biggest vocabulary was a budgie.    Good luck!|`|rW0x3zIyaa	male budgies are traditionally considered male when their beak band is blue. sand paper should not harm them unless they get too much of it, really the sand helps with digestion more than anything. some budgies are not very vocal either, unless they are excited or scared. and sliding down the bars of his cage is just playful behaviour. I know, mine used to do it all the time. a mirror and some toys would help keep him occupied and well stimulated,especially a mirror if you cannot have another bird.|`|AA11583035	For the first week or so the bird will be shy but when it is more comfortable it will chirp more often.   Change the environment often, with new branches, ropes and string and cords and blocks of wood or other toys.   Make small perches for it.  Its behavior will be much more interesting with a companion or two which I highly recommend.  They love attention. Also because your time spent caring for them is about the same with one as it  is for several you might find it more rewarding with more birds.  The best way to take care of them is by getting to know them better by observing them several times throughout the day.  Think about what would make them more comfortable or how you could improve their provisions.  I have the room they are in secure for them to fly every day.  I keep them in a big cage which I have built into a closet with a large window with some lights which also keeps them warm.   Be careful not to expose them to sudden drafts as they could die in their sleep if it gets below 50 degrees.  Feed them various fruit chopped up fine.  Cooked beans make an excellent staple.  The favorite foods from my experience are apples pears and spinach which I finely cop in a food processor  (most green leafy vegetables are also good)  cooked squash, and some chopped citrus fruit.  It is fun to change the diet to see their tastes change.,  Don't leave food out for more than 6 or 8 hours because it will spoil.  They like variety and should have new food offered 2 or three times a day.   Change the water at least every day.  If they don't eat at first, sprinkle some seeds on the fruit and they should voraciously begin eating.  I have found that my budgies much prefer fruit and vegetables over just seeds and they are much healthier and will live about twice as long.|`|AA10597498	the white ring means it's an adult. young birds have just black eyes. most likely, you have a male because most males have blue above their beaks, but there are, rarely, exceptions. sand is probably for digestion, give him cuttlebone, available at most pet stores. he might be bored and lonely, too. give him toys, mirrors, anything. talk and interact with him every day, and he'll get attatched to you and like you.|`|7a1a97b05947f9e6367106facb3184c1aa	It is very difficult to tell the sex of a budgie until they are about four months old.  Yours sounds like a gorgeous baby.  the sand paper wont do any harm, you could try giving your pet shell grit, or use budgie seed with shell grit added.  Sliding down the bars head first is just playing, he is very happy.  If the cere changes to brown your budgie is a female, if is goes a stronger blue, or the budgie tries to feed the mirror with food from his crop it is a male.  Some colours of budgies such as white, albino or lutino don't have the normal cere colouring, they just stay the same even when they mature, weather they are male or female.  You can only watch their behaviour.  Good luck with you new friend.|`|304c2e471e0d5ed1a5f7276d141265e2aa	This is how you tell the sex if the parakeet has a blue color above the beak its a boy if above the beak is pink its a girl Its a boy.

Sand paper is not healthy for your bird. I'm not sure why it is in the cage.A blue cere (the area around the nostrils) indicates a male.The ring around his pupils may be a genetic variant.Beware of mirrors because many birds will bond with mirrors and not with people. He is a flock bird and you are now flock leader so when you convert his diet to a good pellet food and give no more than 10% seeds and 10-20 % fruits and veggies, do so by replacing his all seed diet by 1/4 a week. If you act excited and enthusiastic and eat or pretend to eat the new food, your bird will try the food. If you chirp, sing, and talk enthusiastically to the bird, he will do the same for you. Give him a few treats. Entertain him and he will entertain you. These birds are more intelligent than once thought.Rotate his toys and create foraging opportunities like wrapping food in wax paper with the ends twisted. Hide his favorite fruit in a small aspirin box.Show him what you are doing. Teach your bird to sit on your finger. Enjoy a bath in 2 inches of warm water by flicking the water with your fingers and laughing, your bird will catch on and learn from you.Your bird may be bored. Teach him how to whistle. Talk to him like you would a small child or baby. He will get his motivation from you. I wish you and your bird the most mutually beneficial relationship possible. Open your mind to all the great possibilities and have a tweet year.

As for shock collars...HA!!! They can be extremely effective with most breeds, but labs are a breed apart! You can try it, but I truly believe that your best bet would be a fence, obedience classes, or both.

I have a yellow lab puppy named Chunk.  When he'd take off to go see what the neighbors were up to (and to go rip apart the stuff in their yard), I considered getting the Invisible Fence.  However to fence in our yard, it was going to be $1300.  That was the only drawback to it.  They have thick necks, so I think it'd be okay if you wanted to get that.  Labs love being around people though, so if he's outside, go with him and keep an eye on him.  They shouldn't be left to their own devices.  Give it lots of exercise and then give it something to chew on inside the house and it'll lay around by you and be happy.

As far as keeping it many wild turtles don't do well in captivaty, also many turtles that have been kept in captivaty even for a short time cannot readjust to the wild and die when they are released, so if you want to keep it you are going to need to keep it for its whole life. In fact in some states it is illeagle to release a turtle that has been kept in captivaty for more than 30 days. If you keep it then give it a light and increase the temperature, also give it some live food, and a place to hide (like some aquatic plants) try to make its enclosure as close to the pond where it was found as possable.|`|AA12213644	Please put it back in the wild ASAP.  Nearby where you found him (obviously not back in the pool). He was not captive bred and knows how to survive in the wild.  If you keep him and then release him, he will be use to being cared for and fed. He will also be more apt to get an illness or disease once released.      If you have any more questions, I suggest you visit www.turtleexchange.com/forum There are many friendly people who will advise you on what do to or how to do it.|`|sfdnsoHDaa	There is no reason why you shouldn't keep it.  Unfortunately, way to many pet sliders are let loose in the wild, so keeping this one wont hurt a thing ... as long as you give it the proper set up.      Water turtles are fairly high maintenance.  You have all the care requirements of a turtle, and many of an aquarium.  A proper set up for this guy will cost at lest $100, and will probably be more like $200.  You will need a UV light (long florescent tube), a heat light, a water filter, and a fairly good size aquarium.  Full grown that guy will be over a foot; possible over 14-16 inches.      The most important thing is that you keep the water clean.  They are very messy eaters and will foul the water quickly.  Even with a water filter you will need to do water changes frequently.  If it looks dirty or smells bad it needs to be changed.  A larger aquarium will need cleaning less often.        They typically spend half the time on land sunning themselves and half in water.  Put the heat light over the land part.  They dive in the water as soon as they see anything around him, so you may not see him up there much.    For food, there are pellets, but live food is best.  Crickets, meal worms and wax worms are just some good food items.  When they are older, they'll also eat some lettuce.        If you can't care for the little guy, I suggest giving it to a reptile store or pet store that is knowledgeable about reptiles.  Only keep it if you are willing to keep up with the maintenance required.    Good luck,  Robert, aka Reptile Bob.    PS, if you have an outdoor pond, they do great out there and are virtually maintenance free.  If not, you can consider getting one for it.  Outdoor ponds are the best way to care for them, although they can be eaten by birds of pray or raccoons.|`|MlpnuoRBaa	I have two painted turtles one i found two years ago about quarter size the other last summer about the same size mine are in a 20 gallon tank filled 3 quarters with watr in a window i wedged a piece off wood in level with water bought turttle food at wal mart and they are great they need to be able to sun or their shells will get soft other then that they are in the water all the time also try a little cod liver oil for colorp.s. dont let it be in chlorine water it will die for sure|`|Pp5juixDaa	I know you have good intentions but, please but the turtle back in the wild. It's very bad for turtles from the wild to be taken into captivity. It can't die if it's in water too long, they come up for air, it'll be fine. It'll be even better if you put it back when it was. If you keep it, you have to for life because it will forget how to live in the wild and will die when you set it free again. You need to set it free now.
8ef8b4c67c2bb638ef211c7c2540ee0faa	Previous answers are correct. First of all, there is no such thing as an "American German Shepherd Dog". There are, however, German Shepherds that are from what are considered to be "Americanized" bloodlines. If you check out photos of these compared to the ones that are still more of the old-school German bloodlines, you will see the difference. This happens to a lot of breeds. Your dog is absolutely gorgeous, but from what I can tell from the photo, he is not "show material". If you are wanting a show-dog, you will need to get on-line and look up show breeders (akc.org can help you), or go to a dog show and meet some breeders.  Most owners/handlers will be happy to give you some information as long as they aren't busy. Hope this helps you out. As, I said, your dog is beautiful, so I hope you just love him for who he is.....|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I have a female German Shepherd that is all messed up genetically.  But she 24 in. at the withers,  the highest from front paw up to the tallest point of her shoulders, not to the top of his head.  She is big for a female.    If you got Pedigree Papers & he comes from some good solid stock you might have something to work with.  But he has to meet breed standards & be free of predisposed illness & conformation faults (hip dysplasia)  proven by Xrays.       If you do not have Pedigree Papers then you shouldn't breed & you would probably be disqualified from the ring for something you never knew anything about.  You need to learn everything about the breed that you can gets your hands on.  Lean the breed standards, requirements.    Did you know that even a competent breeder who culls their litters only have 1 in 5 that might, maybe make it to the ring.    So show quality is a very expensive animal.

6CYxRDxhaa	Oh, Shih-poos are wonderful!    I have a Shih-poo and she is soooo smart! I got her when she was a puppy and she is about four years old now.    She is black and her name is Ebony. I also have three Shih-tzus, two girls and one boy.    Yes, you can leave them at home alone. Let me tell you what I do with mine...    I crate train my pups. I have a large metal crate, not the plastic kind, but the type that is metal cage material. It also has a removeable tray in the bottom.    When I have to leave my puppy I leave them in the crate with water, food and a towel, sheet or old shirt to lay on.    When I return home, I immediately take them outside to go potty.    Most pups do not like to soil there "area". Expecially near their food.    But, if they make a mess it is no big deal. Just remove the items and wipe out the inside tray and wash the bedding. Over time your puppy will learn to hold it.    This also keeps them out of trouble when you are not home.    A crate is not for punishment - most dogs look at it as their den.    Shih-poos are smart and they will catch on quick! And of course once they are house broken and learn the house rules then you don't have to use the crate at all.    Good luck!|`|bOr8w1cEaa	Of course you can.  Will he love the idea, No.  Like any other dog they prefer to be with you.  But lets face it people have to work.

Good Luck|`|1ce2270f846511c49f8bba8fb58167dcaa	how long are you planning to leave it home alone?  the dog needs to go out to pee every so often and needs food  and exercise,  if it's a puppy it will need to pee even more than a dog     fyi the puppy store by me calls them shihtpoos (i think that's funnier than shih-poo or shih-a-poo)|`|cQX9RbEsaa	Puppies need a lot of care. If you are not gone all the time then crate training the puppy would be ok. Leave the tv on to make the dog feel as if someone might be there. Make sure when you get home that you take it right outside and give it lots of attention. Also with the Shih-Poo make sure you are not buying it from a puppy mill. Puppy mills are very unsafe breeders and will charge a lot of money for very poor breed dogs. Make sure  you buy from a good breeder. Pet stores often also sell puppy mill dogs so just be careful. www.dogbreedinfo.com is a good place to find good breeders

grytfPQRaa	I am so sorry.  That is heartbreaking.    Unfortunately, if the dog could not be trusted not to bite and attack other dogs, it is the right decision.  He sounds more like he is dog aggressive and not really people aggressive, but still.    As a responsible owner, you have to consider safety above all else.    What a hard decision.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I almost pause in telling you this as I don't want to upset you, but it helps to be educated.   I had the exact same thing happen with one of our dogs. She was VERY dog aggressive and in the process of breaking up a fight with her, my husband was bitten badly.   Well, after working with a behaviorist, we were able to modify her behavior and no incidents ever happened again.   The thing is that dog aggression does not transfer to human aggression and whenever you break up a dog fight you run the risk of getting bitten. ANY dog is capable of biting a person in the middle of a fight, even the dog that didn't start it.   In the future, keep in mind that any negative behavior can be modified and dog aggression is completely different from human aggression. My dog that was dog aggressive never once displayed aggression to humans and never would.   Be at peace with your decision, but at the same time, keep in mind that most times you can work through it if you are willing to put in the work. All in all, only you can know if putting him down was necessary and if you felt it was right then it probably was.   I only shared my experience with you so in the future you can be aware that there are other alternatives to losing your beloved pet. Like I said, it helps to be educated.  What a hard decision to have to make. My heart hurts just hearing your story.|`|ddb8ad067ec32dcdd2fb309b4c8b783aaa	I'm sorry|`|AA11673580	I had German Shepard for many years while living in the country, then we had to move to the city. Prince was used to roaming free and could not adjust to city life and became very depressed if penned up. finally I had to take him to the vet and have him put to sleep. Yes! grown men do cry!|`|DGD0zBB4aa	We had our dog for 15 years and over the years he had had about 8 surgeries...even a twisted stomach. When he turned 14 we noticed a small cancer growth under his chin. When he turned 15 he had bad arthritis and his cancer growth was nearly the size of a golf ball. He started having seizures a lot. The doctors told us that if he burst open his cancer growth, he would die of blood loss. There would be no stopping the blood flow. One night, I was taking him out to eliminate, and all of a sudden, he lost control of his legs and fell and scratched up his cancer growth, and yes it did bleed. I had to hold him up because he could not stand. I thought he would die in my arms. Thankfully he did not. But then it got to the point where he had 2 seizures a day and was holding on dearly to live. We finally made the choice to put him down. When we put him down, I sat there and hung over his lifeless body and cried for about a half an hour. He was the only dog I have had, but we are getting a Weimaraner puppy next month. He truly was a miracle dog, for when he had his twisted stomach, he was within an hour of death, which is what the vet told us. May he rest in peace. Good luck recovering from the heartache of losing a friend.|`|blyE5IuZaa	im so sorry that happend . but you really should not put your self down. you need to think you did it for the right reason even if it is the hardest thing to do. sorry for your loss.
F41NY7Tlaa	assuming your puppy had all its shots, i don't see why not. although, i would pick apart your yard for anything and everything that could be constituted as a choking hazard or just plain bad for your puppy's health. in addition, i would make sure your adult dogs know how to play around your puppy. just watch them play outside for a week or and you can make your own decision then.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Yes, way too young..

I'd first want to know the ages and sizes of the other two dogs and how they interact with the young pup.  And also how long you are gone to work - I assume the usual 8+ hours?  AZ is known for heat in the summer and one dog house for three dogs seems a little small - even if it's large enough for them all to get inside.  Without adequate cooling (breezeway?) it might be too hot with them all inside.  Is your water bowl non-tipping so no one can dump it?  If all three dogs get along well, if there is adequate shade available for the dogs to lay under - trees, porch, whatever, and there is a water source that is not able to be tipped over then it's possible that it will work out.  I would try to come home at lunch time and check on them or have someone check on them for the first few days tho - just to be sure. It's funny tho - 3 months old sounds iffy but when you say four months old, it sounds more do-able!  Good luck!

Say "good potty" when they go outside and no need for punishement on accidents. i have learned that accients are usually my fault (i wasn't paying attention to the signals). be patient! while a pup it will need to go out SEVERAL times per day. It will get easier once the pup gets older and can hold its bladder for longer periods of time.|`|R48fQvYDaa	their is many ways and the fastness can depend on your puppy. but what you do is lay out news paper in the Conner or somewhere and put his poop on top soon he will realize that's the spot as dogs like to poop in a curtain spot. you can also just put the puppy out side after he has eaten and he will poop out side when he does bring him back inside and gradually the puppy will ask to go out side him self  standing by the door. for some puppies this may take time but they learn|`|P6cJXfBsaa	tke him in the morning first then after feeding. in the evening and in the night after feeding take him daily in this period outside.|`|45dfc87923191749a822f49f0b75bea4aa	i recommend you let a professional trainer, like at petsmart or something like that handle your situation.|`|LfSWB1zvaa	crate training is the best, you put ur dog in there for up 2 hours then let it out to go potty outside then you gradually make  the time a little longer. then your dog should get the hang of it.|`|YfHLrP4zaa	my puppy always shred the puppy pads up and go on the floor what is the best way to get her to go outside she pees in the house no matter how long outside
bPdqwkpPaa	You are gone for 8 hours a day or you work for 8 hours a day?  Most people forget to add in the time to commute, get ready, and then down time after coming home.     No one has ever said that people that have jobs can't have dogs.  But, you have to accomodate them.  For a GSD, I'd want a dog walker once a day or doggie day care.  If you choose dog walker, then I'd also want to see the dog get 1-2 hours of work and exercise at least once, preferably twice, a day.      GSD's are true family dogs.  They need to have people around them, or they start to have behavioural problems.     I'd also be concerned if you planned on crating the dog.  GSD's hips are touchy things and being in a cramped cage all day 5 days a week could create serious problems.      Find a good breeder and talk it over with them.  http://www.gsdca.org Don't take it personally if they dont' think you are right for a GSD.  : )|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Well, if you can come home and dedicate hours of play and exercise time to her, yes, it would be okay.

I work a full time job.  They have both been fine.  Start off with a crate until they are trained and you can trust them not to destroy the house.  Give them plenty of exercise before you leave of a morning and when you get home in the afternoon.    Not everyone has the luxury of staying home all day.  Some of us have to work.  And we all can't afford to pay for doggy day care.  But with good training you shouldn't have a problem.  They are so smart and are excellent guard dogs and family pets.  Just be sure to get some good obedience training and give them lots of love and attention.  Good luck.
fSsTdD7qaa	I would select either the Canon Digital Rebel or the Nikon equivalent.  Also select a long lens - 70-300 IS would be best.  You might want a short lens also but I prefer the long lens for action and conformation. Wide angle lenses tend to distort the features.   I would also get a flash if you can afford one. The Canon flashes are very useful for filling in shadows when the sun is not directly on your subject. They also put a sparkle in your horses eye.  These are not cheap, but in my opinion are minimal for quality equine photography, If you can afford more than go for it. The best for amateur would be the Canon 40D or 50D with the 70-200 4.0. If you prefer Nikon ask your dealer for their equivalent.  Leave all the other brands for others.  Point & Shoot are not for action.|`|vow5ULxTaa	I actully dicovered that my JVC Everio Camcorder takes better photos than my digital Camera.  The Camcorder is able to caputure frames quicker and you don't have to hold the camera super steady for the photo to not be blurry.  The plus to the Everio is that you can film to.  The Everio also has memory hardrive so you can store tons of photos and film on your card and upload it straight to your computer.    Here is the model i own.  http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camcorde...  ( the one down side to this camera is it only has a 2 hour battery so i would invest in a 6 hour)    so tips on equine photography.    -The simple rule is this: click off as many shots as you can, for as long as you can.    Set your camera for SPORT/ACTION (fast shutter speed), and start shooting    Slightly overcast days tend to be better than over-bright ones.    Early morning and later afternoon provide softer lighting, which generally produces better pictures.    Whenever possible, shoot OUTSIDE. Most barns have terrible lighting for photos.    It's better to get closer than to zoom, although this can be daunting at times. If you are shooting at a show or event, so that you must remain removed from the action, a telephoto lens will be a must. Purchase the longest zoom you can afford.    As you shoot, try to fit the whole horse inside your viewfinder (your camera's visual frame). You can always crop your photos later.      -  Horses are very expressive wether its with there nostrils ears or tail you should try to take as many photos as possible and pick out the best.

Then you just need to play around with the settings on it and practice with it. Photography takes work for it to end up nice.

You need to learn how to get the best angle when taking the photo so that your horse looks in correct in the photo. A wide angle lens on your camera is desirable along with a close-up. You can zoom into their faces without being so close that you don't get a good photo.|`|uF0guMdJaa	Check out this site    http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-news/2...

AA12385231	I can tell you what you don't need.  An oscar; they grow too big for that tank.  Under gravel filtration: no where near sufficient filtration for cichlids.      A slightly smaller cichlid, such as a JD might work, with a few giant danios as dithers.  Get a power filter rated for 50 gallons plus, set it up for mechanical filtration.  Get a canister filter rated for 50 gallons+, set it up for bio filtration.      Cichlids are messy fish, you do need double the filtration.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Easy.

KeevlZnTaa	I have so many, as I have had probably over 50 rats.    I used to have a rat(Homer) that would open his cage door, and get out of the cage at night. I would wake up to him sitting or sleeping on my chest. He was the only rat that ever did that, and I had to eventually put a clip on his door so he couldn't get out at night anymore(I didn't want to risk rolling onto him).     I also had a rat(Penny) that used to love to bob for apples. In the summer I would fill a shallow bowl and put peas, apples, etc, in the water and she would jump in and get the food. None of my others would do that, and she would get food for them too.    The last favorite moment I will share is about Marcus, who used to love to go to the outdoor ice cream store with me. I used to bring Marcus with me and he would sit on my lap while I ate ice cream.    Rats really make wonderful pets. I have so many great memories of my past and current rats.|`|c88Z21chaa	i have 2 rats, a big, laid back boy and a skittish girl.

AA11565057	I find the best bedding is recycled paper pellets. They're very effective for both odor and liquid control. To help with odor, you could also try wiping the inside of the cage down with vanilla spray vanilla sprays used in fridges. Make sure you get one that is mostly vanilla without artificial additives (ethanol/water is ok though).   I use a cat litter made of recycled paper pellets for my 5 rats and it's very effective.    Steer clear of wood shavings, they can hurt them - can irritate their respiratory tract and are associated with cancer.    You could also try litter training your rats and have a litter box that you clean more regularly.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Aspen and Carefresh are the safest.

A6ritUpHaa	Ok, I'm 14, so maybe advice from someone your age might be helpful.    I used to have hamsters. When they got out, I would panic and cry, like you. First thing to do is calm down.    Now... here are some ham-catch methods that worked for me.    1) Get everyone in the house on look-out. Mom, dad, siblings, guests. If they see the hamster, make sure they say something- or better yet, catch it.    2) Leave out food, and duct-tape a water dispenser to the wall. Maybe put a toy down too. I once caught a hamster chillin' in a "camp" like this I made for her.    3) Set up a bin (like a shallow, empty trash bin) so that it is easy for the hamster to get into, but not out. If your Hamster has a latter toy, prop it up against the side of the bin, so they can climb in. Inside, put some bedding, like in the cage, and food. Do whatever you can to lure the hamster in there. You may just walk up and find him/her pawing at the side, like "WTF? Let me out!"    4) Keep doors out of the house CLOSED, and your eyes OPEN.    If I think of any more methods, I'll be sure to tell you. Good luck!    Oh, and, uh... Dont kick the tubes anymore. >.    EDIT: Check this out:  http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/...    A lot of sites on the internet seem to agree that placing the cage, with food and such, on the floor helps to catch the culprit.|`|07qFHL6iaa	Hammies can't see very well.

KEYgd73saa	Anything at the bottom of the tank, including gravel, is considered a substrate.  Wisteria and Anacharis are the only ones that will actually go in the substrate, and gravel is fine for them.  Java Moss, Java Fern, and Anubias should NOT be put in the substrate-- their rhizomes (root-like apparatuses) NEED oxygenated water, and will rot if buried.  These three plants should be attached to rocks, wood, or even just left to drift.|`|sREBdx35aa	the java moss and fern will be great. they grow any where and under the widest conditions.
8owlj2xHaa	Bubble anemones do not need much food at all. They are one of the anemone that will do well with almost all Photosynthesis.  If you want you can give it a piece of prawn or a couple of frozen mysis, once a week. If you use prawn chop it up into a couple of smaller pieces. I often hear people say that they give the anemone whole silversides or whole prawn. They are not use to such large meals In the ocean they usually only get crumbs from either a clown fish or other crumbs that  just happens to float buy. Fish know NOT to swim within range of them.
a2cjwMKcaa	Be aware that anything you put in is likely to die.    Small invertebrates like shrimp or pond snails are your best option. They can actually survive on algae which is whats likely to grow in there.    Pond water is actually a good option as it will have nutrients and algae spores in there already.     Dont try and kill any bacteria, they are part of the ecosystem you are trying to set up. You will need them to break down the waste products that your critters produce so the alagae and plants can re-use them.    Your 'ecosystem' will need good lighting, but try and keep the temperature stable (no window sills). If it goes green, thats a good sign, you have some sort of ecosystem working.

Maybe shrimp but that's about it. Not seen these things last long-term. Light bioload is essential, otherwise the whole system crashes.    Rather than closed system look into the Walstad Method (again best shrimp only NOT fish).

They are naturally energetic and will do a lot of running. So make sure you provide all necessary equipment such as hamster wheels or adequate size of running space for them to      Hamsters are nocturnal creatures (active at night) so they need peace during the day to sleep. It is highly recommended to place the cage away from draughts and direct sunlight.     The cage floor should be covered with adequate layer of bedding. You can use the commercial wood shaving as they are absorbent and nontoxic.  Hamster also needs privacy during their resting time. Build them a simple small room for them to sleep. A small box will be a good idea.  Feed your hamsters adequately. Make sure they have enough food and more important water supply.  Wash the hamster cage once in a week. Keep the cage clean to prevent any infection risk.  Bathing your hamster are not recommended. Don't worry, they can clean themselves.  Build a good relationship with your hamsters. Talk to them, hold them and playing with the will keep the hamsters happy.
KEYgd73saa	There are people that have reported success in keeping Danios with a Betta, but these are rare and generally short-lived.  A "small school" is of special concern because the Danios are more likely to search for "companionship" with other species.  The Danios do not harm the Betta out of malice, they just have pent up energy that gets spent flying around the tank, chasing each other, which does not translate well into living with slow moving, long-finned fish like Bettas.    In short, I wouldn't recommend it.  You might consider some of the smaller Gouramis, which are quite similar to Bettas.  Honey, Licorice, Chocolate, and Thick Lipped Gouramis are all fantastic choices for Danio tankmates, and much healthier than Dwarf Gouramis.  Also, be aware that White Clouds are on par with Danios in their ability to destroy a Betta, making them poor choices, as well.    EDIT: There is a huge difference between male and female Bettas as far as choosing tankmates, not just because of sex-related aggression, but because of fin length.  Females will be able to escape much more easily because of their moderately normal sized fins.  The entire concept of a school is based on aggression-- they are constantly chasing, nipping at, and bullying one another-- just because people choose to see it as something other than aggression does not make it something other than aggression.    EDIT 2: Uh, no.  Fin type does not matter in the least to other fish.  If they're gonna nip, they're gonna nip-- ease of nipping will not factor into their decision.  Also, it would be much easier for a small fish to nip a large fin-- the fin rays of a crowntail Betta are much harder to "catch" than a broad halfmoon.  Also, 6 fish is not enough to stop aggression-- you'll need a wall of glass.|`|AA11708471	I have kept lots of danios    I have 3 kyathit danios with a female betta and its fine    they are not as nippy as people say|`|NUIrBHXgaa	I think if any fin type of betta is going to be nipped the most likely is the crowntail since there fins are more stringy and split into many different tips( much easier for a small fish to nip on) half moon bettas would probably be the least likely to be nipped since they have big rounded fins.|`|HBsc2wwLaa	Yes. Danios are hardy and ideal for starting up aquariums, but they do nip fins, and can be quite persistant!    Any Male Fighter that has a long enough tail will be a target. You're better off putting White Cloud Minnows in with a Betta.
an1L8njXaa	Can you take him out early in the morning or late in the evening when it has cooled down a bit, if you go at dawn or dusk then it should be cool enough to ride and do quiet a bit of work with him.    I wish we had 30 degrees C, here in the UK we are lucky if we get into the mid 20's in summer and the roads start melting if it gets too much hotternt then about 25!|`|uEQ2LbQyaa	just maybe bareback and hose him down|`|804Qdfmoaa	If he is getting out of shape then yes. You should ride him. But not for long though, only fifteen minutes a day can go a long way. But after you ride him out in the heat, make sure you give him a nice cold hosing or sponging down. I had 4 horses (now only 2) and when it got hot, we wouldn't ride them and started getting out of shape. So we would ride them for about 15 minutes to half an hour a day and then cool them off and they were just fine. Hope this helps! :D|`|gebIjqnWaa	Why not ride him early in the morning when it's not too hot?|`|bTvrv59saa	Riding in hot weather is part of the responsibility of owning a horse. Take him for short really exercising work-outs until he regains his fitness. After he does, just trot around in the woods and stuff so he gets his exercise. THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. Always bathe him afterward so he's not all sweaty. Be shure to groom him. Then he should be fine :)|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	I wouldn't ride him hard if it's over 35 degrees C. You could take him out on a walk and walk up and down hills to help keep muscle tone, but don't do anymore than a little trot and one or 2 short canters. Then hose him off with luke warm water after you ride until his breathing has returned to normal. Also try to ride early in the morning before its hot, or later in the evening when its cooled off. Hope I helped!!|`|UY89MaBSaa	hey im aussie 2    i ride wen its hot but i ride wif sum friends and we play games on horseback with water. ill just give u 1 coz the rest r mine lol     bomb tennis: u need 2 or 4 players (or u culd play bomb cricket wif just 1 person on a horse and the others on foot) a tennis racket (or cricket bat) and as many water balloons as u can get and, well u can guess wat u hav 2 do, throw water balloons at people and they hav 2 hit them bak but just b careful of ur horse.|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I'm in Florida.  We have months of 90+ degree heat and humidity.  I have a couple of tricks that I have followed for years.  First, ride at night.  Of course, that requires lights, but right now, I am at a really cheap place, and even they have one spotlight up in the pasture, where I can ride around in a big enough circle to get some work done.  The shadows let me look at how my horse is doing, I've never been in an arena with mirrors.  Two, sometimes I cool the horse down with a quick rinse off BEFORE riding.  I didn't used to do this, but an old cowboy mentioned "well, they get wet when you ride, why would riding them wet hurt?"  Made sense to me.  Third, I ride in the rain.  A good rain always cools things off, grab an old saddle, or hop on bareback and ride!  Because most shows are during the summer, I think that it is important to ride in the same conditions that I would be showing under.  If a horse is used to being ridden in the heat, he is much less likely to tie up than one that is suddenly brought out to show all day in the heat.  Lots of water, of course.|`|fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	Here in Washington State, when it's hot out... we ride|`|KRgfXsFtaa	Yes you can ride your horse in the heat. Use common sence of how hard you work him. If possible have him drink somewhere|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Cool him out thoroughly by walking after riding and then give him a hose-off if you have a place to do that.  If you don't want to ride you can lunge him to keep him in shape.    Another idea is to ride in the early morning or after the sun goes down when it's cooler if you have arena lights.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	I live in Florida... it's always that hot, if not hotter.  So, yes I ride when it is hot.|`|VyXYcCXtaa	what is it in degrees f|`|pnDZcQKpaa	take a hose and spray him off a little bit. make sure not to spray his face, because it might spook him. it'll help cool him off, and you can also give him a bath. just take a bucket of water and dip a big sponge in it with some horse shampoo and scrub him all over. if you can, just hold him with a lead rope and halter, or have your friend hold him. he'll appreciate it, and will look amazing when you're done washing him.  to exercise, turn him out and chase him around the paddock/field. it'll help get energy out. make sure to put a fly sheet and mask on him to protect him from flies and the UV rays.   hope i helped!
3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Well, my limited experience with them has been about 2 months now.  I have 2 of them-yes I know, they prefer groups, I "rescued" from a 10 gallon cesspool at my boyfriend's work.  Anything that survived that 10 gallon disaster, in my opinion, is a hardy fish.  The tiger barbs are the only survivors lol...guppies, eels, neon tetras, plecos, snails did not fair well understandably.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	About average.    They need a properly set up, cycled and maintaned aquarium of a decent size. As long as you can provide them with that they are pretty hardy.    Ian
9Ff4Bms7aa	1. No, it's not wrong that you cry over your fish. Bonds between pets and an owner are the same, be it with a cat, dog or fish.  People just think that they shouldn't cry over such small things because they think they can 'just buy another one with the identical physical appearance' since they are so inexpensive pets (fish themselves, not the tanks and materials are relatively cheap compared to buying other pets).      2. Some questions are did you cycle your tank? What size IS your tank? What are your catfish (there are many different types of catfish)?    3. The slime could be some sort of fungus growth, try adding some 'Pimafix' and see if there is any improvement. A pinch of aquarium salt might help them, too (NOT kitchen salt).    4. It is recommended to only do a maximum of 30% water change, too much "new water" can fluctuate/drop the temperature in the tank, which would affect your bettas since they are tropical fish (heater is needed for them) and/or also make a huge change in your water paremeters and completely stress out your fish.    5. Are there any other symptoms your fish has shown? (Irregular breathing, odd behavior, sitting on bottom of tank, floating on the side?)    I hope your fish get better, and best of luck!    ADDED:  ~75% is still a bit too much of a change for these fish.  ~Usually, gasping for air would mean that these fish do not have oxygen, but this does not seem to be the case as you have two filters and more than enough space for them.  ~Check the temperature: were there any changes? A drop or rise of a degree or two can completely stress out your fish.  ~The three year old betas most likely died of old age, not a disease, as betas live 2-3 years (meaning these betas lived a full life).    ~Do you have some Pimafix in your home? I am highly suspicious that this mucus-like substance is a fungus.  ~Did the corys that passed have any strange physical and/or behavior changes? (Any ripped, torn fins? were the fins black, etc?) If not, this may have simply been a bad batch.|`|DT71taKcaa	I heard somewhere that you shouldn't use power filters with Betta's because they make the water current too strong.    It's not wrong at all to cry over something you loved, but you have to just get over it, which sounds harsh, but its true...     The slimy stuff might be a fungal infection, so treat them with Melafix, which treats all common funguses in fish. And do you have a heater? If you don't, colder water could let diseases like ich in.  You should also test for ammonia in your water, but that might not be the problem as you do 75% water changes...Also i would cut the water changes to 50% a week to leave some of the good bacteria in.    I hope i have helped, and that your remaining fish get better...|`|6hCj1j4saa	hi for a start 75 percent water change is far far to much 10 percent weekly should do as rule of thumb.it might not have enough bacteria build up in it with the two filters running as for adding 5 fish at once not a good idea take it slow if it was me i would remove 1 of the filters or buy 1 that suits the size of the tank ( litres ) you could have to much filtration this happens hoe this helps good luck..........your heater is to high and leave it running dont put any more fish into it yet go to your local deslear and buy a water conditioner called STRESS ZYME give it time and take it slow good luck|`|XL2vg7eaaa	It is possible one of the new fish had a disease, and it has spread to the others. Before adding new fish, put them in a separate tank for a day or two to see if they are healthy. Also, that is a lot of water to change. Are you letting the water you add sit for 24 hours before pouring it in? Are you feeding them too much? How old is the gravel? Are you changing it? If you are, stop immediately. Gravel is best for your fish when it is older. Check out the website in my sources about what your Beta fish might have. Also, I know how you feel. My beautiful goldfish that I got awhile ago all passed away, except for one. Now I am worried about the only survivor (Goldie) as she has formed a huge growth on her eye, and now is blind in both eyes. I hope you find out what is the matter, and whatever you do, don't get more fish until you find out what the problem is!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I would be more concerned if you were not upset. I would rather you cry than be emotionally dead.     Never perform a complete water change. You destroyed the beneficial bacteria that breaks down fish waste.    Do you have a heater?    ~Turn up the heat. Tropical fish like their water temperature between 77F-82F.|`|sDSOqtQeaa	maaybe try going to the pet store for some help. they can give you the best advice.|`|plxrH0vKaa	you have never replace more than 30 % of the water|`|VD3M8izdaa	omg o.o  murderer >.>    lol, perhaps the water isn't cleaned enough... or you're changing it too rapidly.  i'd give it more time between changes    here are some sites for these..|`|AraBfesHaa	I'm pretty sure the water changes didn't have anything to do with it since you've been doing in all along and the fish have been fine.  I'm not sure what they're dying of, but when I'm in this situation I always use maracyn and maracyn2.  They are my curealls.  I've brought at least 3 fish back from the brink of death with this when I had no idea what was wrong with them (and I mean probably minutes from death, floating on side and hardly breathing at all, one laying on bottom of tank and barely breathing-ou had to look realy close to see his gill just barely moving.  5 months later, he's still swimming all over the place.  Don' t know where you are, but if there are pet stores still open where you are, you should go get them.  They're two different antibiotics and you can use them simultaneously if you need to, although I've never done it that way.  Maracyn2 is my choice.  They treat bacterial, fungal infections, dropsy (2), fin and tail rot disease, etc.  It treats way more than what it says on the box.    I'm the same way I cry when just one fish dies.  I can't imagine what you're going through.  I get frantic over one sick fish!    God bless you.  Please try these meds ASAP.  Really, I call them my miracle drugs.|`|ssHzAVlwaa	The water change is waaaaay too much. You shouldn't do more than 25% within a months time. Also, when you add the water conditioner, are you getting the kind with the slime coat. This isn't really good for the fish. It obviosly causes a slimy coat and can clog the water. They won't filter it properly. Try to cut back on the water changes.|`|sREBdx35aa	75% water changes is way to much, cut back to 10 % weekly. Also, it's possible you are mothering the tank to death (no offense) add lots of plants and let the tank balance out.|`|ZR67nVPEaa	If you give specific symptoms your fish had prior to dying, it will explain why they died. By having slimy mucus on their gills, it means that they're sick so tracking down the disease will help. Can you explain if your 2 remaining betta fish are acting differently in any other way?    And yes, I agree about the water changes. Changing 75% of the water so often is probably giving shock to your fish and it's harming their defense system. The most you can change the water (imo) is 50% every two weeks, and that's really stretching it. Unless your fish tank is extremely overstocked, you should do around 25% weekly water changes at most.
7Th7KBPuaa	you should observe them for a little while and if they start really fighting seperate them!!!|`|cesTfRKPaa	Maybe they lied to you, and actually gave you a male and female?|`|rDsKB0uXaa	sounds like a crazy hamster|`|nnf4znP4aa	its normal. it might be the mate dance.|`|CQww1c2daa	You should probably keep them in separate cages.  They have different personalities.|`|krqfJViEaa	Ahh dont worry its normal, i assure you. They are extremely active and are very playful towards each other. As long as they are no scratches, bruises, cuts, blood then they're just playing with each other. Its common with Robovorski hamsters.|`|hDQNCG31aa	Im guessing you bought one guy and one girl?|`|W2GcDwyOaa	They are playing :-), perfectly normal|`|zdBInQReaa	I think they are just rough housing, All boys do it! If one is a girl, you will have babies, no problems, Just separate them later!
bDPVRtCNaa	The minimum for a single fancy goldfish is 20 gallons. If he has not growth to his full potential (6-8 inches) than the tank is causing health issues such as stunting.|`|2Jmodoaeaa	Well, first of all any Goldfish needs more space than 10 gallons. 10 gallons is just not enough for a goldfish which could be causing his growth to stunt (which could be causing him to do that). I'd try a 20-30 gallon tank, and go on ahead and keep up the stress coating.
zdBInQReaa	Don't worry! Was your hamster housed with other hamsters, if it was it is a dwarf, If it was larger and has no dorsal stripe it is a Syrian hamster. There are many types of dwarfs, 4 kinds I think. I only know 2 of them. Robo hamsters are tiny, like less than 2 inches, and normal dwarfs are 2.5+ inches. My dwarf is tiny and like 2.5 inches so I am just telling you that some are smaller than others. I also think there are winter white hamsters, I think they are white with black eyes, I don't know.  oh, feed it any kind of hamster/gerbil/mouse food. I used mouse food for a while and my hamsters were fine, but maybe normal hamster food is better.
7cm4dZVaaa	Isn't one of your dressage warm-ups to have the horse go long and low, stretching for contact with the bit?  Continue to practice that, but don't pick her head back up.  There is a limit  to long and low, however, the horse should not have their ears below their withers, it is specifically against the rules, and is supposed to be penalized.|`|AA12320299	keep your reins long. if the horse keeps jerking its head up, collect your reins until u can feel some connection between u and ur horse. pull slightly on ur left rein then right a few times then relax. keep doing thins until the horse knows were you want their head. pretty soon after practice they should no were there head sould be and be relaxed.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	please dont make ur gorgeous dressage horse look like lazy depressing western horse!    sry.....i just had to say that....go ahead...report me xD|`|vaulPrAmaa	long riegn her, make sure she isn't head shy, and if that doesn't work ride her while someone holds a good-smelling treat below her  =P|`|oOfTCWlEaa	The best way to get a horse to drop its head is repeat training. At a walk, gather the reins and put a small amount of pressure on her mouth until she drops her head, then release.  This is not something that happens over night, it takes lots and lots of time of repeating and patience.  Once your mare starts holding her head lower at a walk, then do it at a trot, and a canter.  Some horses take much longer than others and it also depends on the natural headset of the animal for how low she will hold her head for you.    Hope this helps
9tQSBMAQaa	I would watch her stool for a day or so and see if "things come out alright."  If you don't see the string in a few days, you may have to take her to a vet.  I suspect she will pass the string with no problem.|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	keep an eye on her and see how she does in the next cupple days...|`|uQrIdrjfaa	y ru leavin string in a place she can get it|`|ybwqYZ1waa	I don't think it would matter............... although that would be disturbing if a long string was in her...   2|`|WPRAfLO7aa	Thats bad. It can get twirled up in her intestants. Take her to a vet.|`|ul1P1qAQaa	Well... what CAN you do? Are you actually going to try to get it out? If it's not still an option just keep it in mind, and unfortunately it might even be good to make sure she gets rid of it... like hopefully you will actually see it in her poop over the next week... because if you aren't certain... and she ends up getting sick anytime in the near future, you won't be able to cross out the possibility that she has an impaction in her intestines... she will probably be fine. You'd be doing yourself a favor to make sure it comes out though.    My dog eats bees and christmas ornaments and recently she ate the stuffing out of her bed as well as a wrapper my brother stuffed in the couch... I'm always terrified when she does stuff like that, but so far no harm has come of it.    What you don't want to do though... is freak and take her into the vet and have them perform complicated, expensive, and painful open surgery on her belly if she can poop it out all by herself... so keep it in perspective. She is a dog. If that was going to kill her dogs wouldn't be such a common household pet... because they eat stuff, weird stuff, and it's impossible to stop them... she would eat sticks and bugs if she wasn't in the house, so... don't fret... just be mindfully aware of the possibility of an issue.|`|rgqDS5VKaa	Umm....I think you should not worry about it tell she starts acting funny. Remember: dogs digest better then cats|`|lg3MQJsnaa	Keep a watch on her stool, she should pass it within 2-3 days. If it's runny or she's having problems, you need to get her to the vet ASAP. You might want to take her in anyway, just to be safe. The string can get stuck in her intestines, and that will need surgery to remove.    Since she's a small breed, I'd take her in to be safe. It's really your choice.|`|5IyJoLM8aa	I would say that it should be ok, just keep an eye on it.  When my pit was younger, he actually ate a Kong and had to have surgery, but the strings and tennis ball pieces he would eat came right out.  He is bigger, but I found out from the vet that if it fits in the intestine, and string would, it will come out in the end.|`|Cl23eeneaa	When did this happen?? In my professional oppinion if this just happend keep an eye on her for a day.  If it has been more then a day or two and she has not passed it in one of her bowl movements and is showing signs of discomfort she may be obstructed (she could have a blockage somewhere)..Signs to look out for : not acting right, has a sore belly, or starts to vomit after eating or drinking - call your vet asap..  IF you see the object hanging out of her mouth while trying to throw it up or you see it hanging out of her hind end while trying tp have a bowel movement DO NOT PULL IT OUT! I cannot stress that enough due to the fact that this object could be stuck around something.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	My Shepherd chewed the soft plastic ring out of a Floating Frizbee and gobbled it down before either of us noticed. He'd never torn up a toy that before.    Each piece  showed up in the yard about two weeks later.      I think it was on the order of Roto-Rooter.    Not sure about string. Watch for any strange or sick behaviors until it passes out the other end.    Maybe the vets will comment
TSc8OE4vaa	15-16 is perfectly fine, usually.  It really all depends on the individual horse and its conformation.  Sometimes they will get arthritis and need to be worked less.  The younger a horse was when its training was started, the younger it will have to be when it retires.    Some horses might need joint supplements (cosequin is a good one) to stay fit.    I personally know many horses in their 20's who still compete, but I know others who had to be retired before the age of ten.  It all depends.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	i know horses that have showed recently, and they are like, 25. so, until they get worn out really.|`|c88Z21chaa	oh 15-16 is fine! If ur horse shows signs of aging just reduce height and workload etc. I had a horse who was competing at 29 years of age. We actually didnt know he was that old or he probably would have been retired, but we r glad because he loved it and had a great time. He was jumping 1 meter but i was competing at 75cm (i was very young and he was very old lol)    As long as ur horse is fit and healthy, with nicely moving joints, he/she will keep going for years yet!    xoxo|`|u1HahCoqaa	Depends on the individual. Most horses can be competed until pretty old (You do see 25 year old ponies out there) but as they age you may have to go down the levels. I still compete my horse and he's 18- 15-16 is fine. You just have to make sure they are in shape for it- this is important for horses of any age, but as they get older it is especially important!|`|QTT9380Yaa	The horse I am riding for her owner still shows and she is in her 20s. She still does well and comes out champion against younger horses. So of course 15-16 is still ok, as long as you aren't doing anything too strenuous.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	It really depends on the horses condition and joints. Overall I would say YES its fine to show the horse. Of course extra precaution should be taken to prevent injury because as horse ages their ligaments and tendons become less flexible and more prone to injury. Stickin the horse on a joint supplement if they show signs of arthritis will help too.    I have an almost 19 year old appaloosa gelding and he still shows. Although a show jumping injury this past summer has ended his jumping career (It's cause i'm afraid to jump, not him) he still whoops the competition, most of which he is twice to three times the age of. And that is in speed which is just as difficult, demanding, and dangerous as jumping.|`|ndqjst7taa	Sure as long as there health and fit i showed my arab mare an she was 24 i know that because she was register|`|7cm4dZVaaa	A sound, healthy horse can compete.  A lot of show jumpers are in their 20s.  The only thing age does for a horse is make it better as long as it is sound and healthy.  You should take extra care of your older horse, though, because as any of us age, we are more prone to injuries.|`|b0VK8pPcaa	Depending on the horse it can be any age, 15 and 16 are fine the horse is still pretty young. 18 is were u may see some problems. But see how sound he/she is|`|d5hWW6b0aa	It depends on the horse, i knew a girl who showed her horse until 15 and another who showed him until 22, it really depends, the 22 year old was an arabian and they can go until the day they die, so.
cJbEEGQaaa	Never tap a hamster on the nose, this can damage their noses, and will aggrevate them and make them bite more.  If they dont bite more, it will only be because they are terrified of you, and thats no way for an animal to live!  It takes time for an animal to get used to a huge hand (in comparison to their size) entering their personal space.  Wash your hands before doing it to make sure they dont smell of food, as hamsters have very bad eyesight and will think your hand is just extra food.  Until your hamster is used to your hand, you could try wearing a pair of gloves when you put your hand into the cage, or you could try not holding a bowl of treats towards your hamster - this could startle them into biting.  Instead, hold one treat between your fingers and try it this way.|`|NVx3iRZJaa	Patience.|`|1YYmQI5Naa	When he bites you tap him on the nose. It doesn't hurt them, but it annoys them.|`|KFu7596Paa	dont ever tap any animal on the nose     you need to be patient and handle him every day daisygirl is correct get a treat place it on you hand     it will take time rome wernt built in a day     the hamster has to have time to get used to your hands|`|BaNrweQ4aa	you just need to give it time, and just keep trying to feed your hamster food and treats out of your hand, but be patient. make sure you wash your hands properly; because that might be why you keep getting bitten. your hamster could just be scared or anxious about what you are going to do. just keep your distance when you try and hand feed yoru hamster, and maybe just put your hamster in the exercise ball a lot more to get it used to the surroundings :)|`|CvLwS9p5aa	hammies cant see well, when you handled the treats, you got the smell on your fingers, she smells the smell, ties to eat it problem solved
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    You never want to wear gloves when you handle a hamster.  They're going to smell a million things on the - everything but what you want them to actually, which is YOUR scent. Also, when you're getting ready to handle him/her, take a few deep breaths and be calm - your hamster is very perceptive and will be able to sense if you're nervous.    If you follow the steps I'm about to list, you can do it safely, without being bitten - and without the gloves!  I've rescued hundreds of hamsters of the years and this method has never failed me.      This is great for dwarf (any of the 4 breeds) or Syrian (aka Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda, etc)!    Remember to never wake your hamster up to play! They'll be calmer if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Ditch the gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish (and dwarfs are little speed demons so it may try to run up your arm). Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience|`|lhmsAlQuaa	put your finger near his nose sometimes but not to close it worked for me and then i fed it then i petted it and in 1 week i gained his full trust and i can trust him being on my shoulder with him biteing me! or put a glove on one hand and dont put one on the other and hold him with the glove and the hand make sure he doesnt get near under your finger nails that will hurt so much!|`|s80ED7Ygaa	Just take the gloves off and handle it. Then when it gets used to it then start feeding it.|`|zdBInQReaa	If the gloves are leather, It wants to eat them! don't try to pet it in the cage. Instead, let it crawl into a toilet paper tube, and lift he tube. It will not bite you and your hamster will be more comfortable.
BaNrweQ4aa	i just buy any sawdust from pet shops, and i have for all five of my hamsters and they don't seem to find it a problem. they dig around and it goes all over them, and sometimes it can just get in there eye a tiny bit (but it's gone within a few seconds) and sometimes a bit of sneezing - but quite sure it's not from the dust. sawdust always seems to work and it also keeps the hamsters warm, when they mix it with their bedding. dust free sawdust sounds really good as, it's dust free! :) hope i helped x|`|JmD0oq2Naa	ive always used sawdust for my hamsters and ive never had a problem. im using it now, and my hamster is nearly 3 years old|`|5yDnw2oRaa	Thats what I used when I had a hamster and it was perfectly fine, never had a problem with it in 3yrs x x|`|zdBInQReaa	There is always dust with wood chips, and That is why i don't use them. I use carefresh, the white kind, it is better at absorbing everything!|`|HvOsxRMWaa	YES IT IS.  STORE SAW DUST IS THE BEST & NEVER USE SAW DUST FROM WOOD YOU CUT UR OWN.|`|SeWffWCHaa	its ok however the best thing you should use is woodchippings sometimes the dust in the sawdust irritates the eye and can possibly cause infection/injury. it can also get stuck in their fur too and irritates their skin and then they keep scratching to get rid of it and can result in cuts and infection with any dirt that gets in the cut like the hamsters urine. these are possibility's it might not happen to your hamsyer but it is possible
9Ff4Bms7aa	post your problem onto craiglist. There are people in search of guppies that will be more than happy to buy/take your guppies for you.  These people are usually close to the area where you live, as they organise different ads that are in separate locations.    You can sell your tank and supplies there as well, or sell/give them all as one single thing.    Is there anyone you know that likes to care for fish? You can give away your guppies that way.|`|e3801fbb401743baa0ab90373a0be8ebaa	Don't give them away  new inexperienced owners would most likely be unsure of what to do  and they would die  Humanely?  Give them up to a pet store.  Go on Yahoo Local  and type in pet store  call th em up and say  "i have 20-30 healthy guppies  I want to get rid of them humanely...will you please take them"    stay quiet and see if they say "alright..we'll pay you...."  otherwise....just tell them "you can have them for free."  the pet stores here take in sick fish that owners can't take care of   I'm pretty sure someone will take the guppies.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	FOR SALE    Complete tropical fish tank, xx Gallons.    Comes with 20 small fish    $20 or Near Offer.    Phone xxx-xxxx|`|cesTfRKPaa	Give them away or put them in a pond, not a river or ocean a pond!|`|37TowRL7aa	oogle.com  or ask on yahoo who wants them in your area.  worked for me!|`|Ps8IqLXwaa	I recommend you put a post on www.craigslist.org site in the pets area in the community section.  Or on your local free-cycle site.|`|ssHzAVlwaa	I agree that you should put them in a pond. I don't think the pet store would be a good idea because most pet stores sell guppies as feeders for smaller meat eating fish. So that won't have a chance of survival if they go to a pet store. Putting them in a pond will ensure that they will die naturally and not by the hands of humans or mouth of an OSCAR or PACU.|`|o9dMd2rBaa	Give them away to somebody who wants them, otherwise try asking the store that is very far away if they would take them|`|T6yYgMIUaa	Post your fish and your tank on craigslist. I am always taking in fish that are unwanted.|`|W07vMTQvaa	Maybe call the local elementary school and see if a teacher would like to have the tank and fish for the classroom.  You could also put it on Craig's list and give the fish away but you should give away the whole set up, not just the fish.
KeevlZnTaa	Rats do make great pets, but I do not think small rodents are good for young children. Rats can easily be injured by a small child(being grabbed, dropped, stepped on, etc, could seriously hurt them).    I have had about 50 rats in my life(used to keep about 13 at a time). Some were calm and gentle, they preferred to be held and pet. Others were wild and adventurous, they didn't have the "time" to sit still and be petted and cuddled. I have had ones that were very skittish and didn't like to be interacted with at all, they preferred being with other rats and didn't feel comfortable being held.    Rats are quick movers which makes them bad candidates for young children. Some kids get excited at the movement and can accidentally kick, hit, etc, a small animal and kill and injure it. I used to take my rats with me to an outdoor ice-cream place(one at a time), and the kids loved them, but many small children would try and grab them or would be way to rough while petting them. The children were not purposely trying to harm the animal, they just got excited, or didn't really understand that they were too rough(even after parents told them)    Rats are also very social animals and need quite a bit of interaction with their caregivers to remain emotionally healthy. Allowing a rat to run around on you and a 6 year old for a few minutes every once and awhile is not enough. They thrive on interaction(they are community dwellers), and need a minimum of 1-2 hours a day of interaction with people, playing and exploring out of their cage. I do not know any 6 year old that would be able to commit that much time. They also should be kept in same sex pairs, so getting only one rat is already off to a poor start.    I love rats and am only telling you all this b/c of my love for the animal. I do not think that small rodents make good pets for young children. They are too easily to injure or kill. Personally I would wait for your child to get a little older, for the sake of the animal.|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Well. You would have to be the primary caretaker, and should always supervise him when he pets the rat. Only let him hold it when he's sitting down, and teach him to pet it gently. And you should get two rats, obviously they won't mass reproduce if you get the same gender. They are social and should have company of another rat. Do some research on them, the ASPCA website has a good basic care guide on rats. :)|`|JGq9rKBOaa	No animal is a good pet for a 6 year old. If you get any animal, the responsibility for caring for it WILL fall on the adults.    That said, if you want to get a family pet, a six year old can definitely help out with the care and learn to handle the rat properly. Still, you'll be the one making sure the cage is cleaned. You'll also need to supervise the child with the rat - 6 is a little young to handle an animal alone.     If you do get rats, make sure it is ratS. Rats are very social and two same-sex rats won't be any more work than one - and they'll be happier.    Still, if you don't want rats and are only considering it because you've got a 6 year old begging for one, don't be afraid to say no...better to have no pet than a neglected one that a kid gets sick of in a few weeks.|`|RHUDduUbaa	NOOOO i wouldnt   get a rabbit or cat or puppy 4 her|`|NoGmacqNaa	No i dont think so bc aggressive with small animals without knowing it i would suggest a aunt farm or sumthing fun and cool like that|`|I6KKFwxXaa	I would suggest 2 of the same sex and if you taught your 6 year old how to care for the rat it would be fine rats are very social and one rat would be a lot more to take care of than 2 this probably doesn't make since but with 2 rats they have each other and with one rat it has your child and if your child wants to play with friends etc... then the rat will be lonely and that is not a good thing. I have 4 of them and they are great with kids. I would suggest before getting one or the pair same sex of course that you educate your child about them there are a million web sites out there with information. make a play area that is both safe for the rat and your child where they can be supervised. Save yourself some money and buy the big cage now. make sure the wires are for small animals I just got my 4th one yesterday and had to buy a cage just for her because my other 3 are a year old and in a ferret cage so yes she is alone but before anyone says anything I do take them all out together to socialize and they have been doing very well with her. I have 3 hairless and the other id black and white hooded I have found the hairless do not pick up the odor the one with hair does and I keep their cage clean.  the first site is the best for everything rat I have used it a lot|`|AA10534526	Sure. My cousin has had one since she was a little younger than 6. She still has it and she's 10.|`|TyTMrtEwaa	NO. rats are high maintenance. plus rats are very social. just having one will put a lot of pressure on the rat unless the kid is playing with it 20 hours a day which is impossible. if you want to, get 2 rats of the same sex and let her parents take care of it.|`|f6RCFUNwaa	no, becuase the baby can not appreciate the animal. It may also drop it or nock it off a table. I could also abuse the rat and cause it to bite the baby|`|f12Uz4bRaa	Rats are VERY social animals and should be kept in same sex pairs. You'll have to be the primary care taker and make nsure he/she doesn't get hurt  SUPERVISE SUPERVISE SUPERVISE  Oh and research  goosemoose.com and ratclub.org are good places to start|`|6lXkzc5Aaa	Yes they will love the 6 year old as long as he/she doesn't hurt him. But get 2 they will get lonely by themselves.    YES RATS MAKE GREAT PETS. but maybe wait until the childs alittle older 7 or 8      :)|`|PRmowDRPaa	To tell you the truth i think a rat or a mouse is a really bad pet for a 6 year old because what if it bites. runs away,scratches ECT and i dont think your 6 year old brother or sister wants to pick up it poo and clean the cage and what if your mom or who ever will doesent like picking up poo|`|O0sw6TWXaa	no way,  they need alot of attention if you only get one.  you should really get two  if you even consider getting rats.  the 6 year old will probably forget to feed it or give it water,   also do you know anything about them??  please do alot of research on them.
9Ff4Bms7aa	I think this is a bladder problem, or maybe he has too much gas. Whatever it may be, Fish never do things like this for fun.    feed him some crushed/skinned peas and see if he gets any better.|`|plxrH0vKaa	for me its brain attack and probably die in a little time|`|x3ly5oSdaa	He might have a swim bladder or what ever its called.|`|bTvrv59saa	If he seems fine almost all of the time, then he should be fine. My crowned PearlScale does that too and she's gonna have babys soon. She's a show fishy!
x3ly5oSdaa	Brother and Sister mating can have deformed babies, however a father/daughter or mother/son can be ok. Hamsters can get pregnant at 3 weeks old thats when they get sexually mature. I would get rid of the other hamsters. If you aren't going to sell them , I would suggest spaying or neutering.|`|RHUDduUbaa	yes it will be a problem and can result in sickness deformation and other horrid symtems|`|FcikBacZaa	Let's hope the babies all die!    They WILL be deformed!     BLAH!
