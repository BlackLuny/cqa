Al término de la ceremonia nupcial el oficiante le dice al tal Pit0rro: “Ya puede usted besar a la novia”. Se inclina él sobre Pirulina para darle el beso, pero ello lo detiene y le dice: “Hoy no, querido.

20081120115831AAQtLlF	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Twilight Movie-Rome Sneak Peak Scene?	In the scene, when Bella is introduced to the Cullen's, the Cullen's are cooking Italian food for her. I know that the Cullen's have to pull off a human facade so that people won't become suspicious, but, when they were cooking, how did they know what to cook? Like, I know obviously that they have to stalk up on food so that no one will ask questions like "So, how come you don't have any food, etc". In the scene, they are watching a tv cooking show, but how exactly did they know what to cook? Would've Alice predicted what for them to cook ahead of time from the tv show from her visions? Were they looking at a cookbook as well ? (i didn't see, not sure if so). Because, it was bugging me how they knew what to cook from a tv commercial that was just airing and had the right ingredients as well.    I hope this question isn't confusing! Any answer would be great.      Here's the link to watch the scene:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4w0L1rN-...

Le dice el encargado: “La daré la Suite Emperador. Es el mejor cuarto que tenemos”. Pregunta el viajero, cauteloso: “?No será muy caro?”. “Lo tenemos en promoción -responde el otro-. Usted verá”. El viajero se dirigió a su alojamiento. Apenas se había acostado cuando entraron dos voluptuosas mujeres. Sin decir palabra se despojaron de toda vestimenta haciendo un strip tease sensual, y luego se metieron en la cama. El viajero, entusiasmado, recorrió con ellas todo su repertorio erót1c0. Al día siguiente bajó a la recepción para hacer el check out. “?Cuanto debo de la habitación? -le pregunta al encargado-. Estuve en la Suite Emperador”. Contesta el hombre: “No debe usted absolutamente nada. Ya le había yo dicho que tenemos ese cuarto en una promoción muy especial. Tanto, que aparte de no pagar nada recibirá usted un bono de 100 pesos”. El viajero, feliz, recibió la cantidad y se marchó. Al regresar a su ciudad de origen les contó a sus compa?eros de trabajo lo que le había sucedido. Uno de ellos decidió hacer la prueba. En efecto, al pasar por aquel pueblo fue al mismo hotel y pidió una habitación. “Le daré la Suite Emperador -le dice el encargado-. La tenemos en promoción muy especial”. Al nuevo viajero le sucedió lo mismo: apenas se había metido en la cama cuando llegaron otras dos curvilíneas féminas, se desvistieron con sen5uale5 movimientos e hicieron con el visitante toda suerte de acrobacias lúbrica5. Al día siguiente el recepcionista del hotel le dijo al viajero que no debía nada por el cuarto, y le entregó el bono de 100 pesos. La historia, naturalemente, empezó a cundir, y pronto empezaron a llegar a aquel hotel viajeros de todas partes que pedían la Suite Emperador. Todos tenían la visita de dos hermosas chicas, no pagaban nada y recibían los 100 pesos. Cierto día llegó un forastero y solicitó la Suite Emperador. Igual que todos recibió la visita de un par de bellas muchachas, y pasó con ellas la mejor noche de su vida entre deliquios insospechados e inéditas demostraciones de pasión. Al día siguiente el visitante bajó a la recepción y pidió su cuenta. “No debe usted nada -le dice el encargado-. Y tiene usted derecho a estos mil pesos”. “?Mil pesos! -se asombra el viajero-. A todos les dan 100. ?Por qué a mí me dan mil?”. Explica el recepcionista. “Porque ésta es la primera película p0.rn0 que filmamos llevando como estrella a un conocido político”...

Long time guitar player first time band starter. (Yeah I know, but better late than never huh?)I want to just get a cover band going. Nothing serious just occasional parties and gigs. I'm just trying to brainstorm and think of some good songs, but I'm kind of drawing a blank.I like all kinds of Rock music from Zeppelin to Sex Pistols to Audioslave and System of a Down. The bands I listed in my question are just what I'm listening to alot of these days and music I love to play on guitar and that I think would be cool to play live. Any other bands and songs would be appreciated. I'm finding it harder to keep up with new music these days, so if there's anything out there now I'm missing that you think may fit along those lines please let me know.      Do you want to be as diverse as you can with your covers, or is it too much for one band to do Zeppelin and Nirvana songs? Diversity, or Narrow it down to one style of genre of rock bands?      Thanks for your help. Its my first time on here, so I apologize if this is too long.

20090220174919AA66lhS	Entertainment & Music;Radio	R.I.P. 97.1FM Talk Radio. los angeles?	BLOW ME UP TOM!!      that was the last thing said before 97.1 fm talk radio left the air at 5pm  2-20-09      I was a faithful listener since 1998. I remember being in high school and actually taking notes on tom's Rules on how to pick up chicks. I remember staying up till 3 am listening to the john and Jeff Show. I remember Laughing My Butt Off with Howard in the Mornings and Changing the station after the show was over just to listen to the Triples at in the afternoons.  Corolla In the mornings will be miss and even bonaduce will be missed, and how could I forget Tim Conway, he was always cool to listen to.       It kind of felt like the last day of School right before you graduate. saying good bye to long friends knowing that maybe that will be the last time you ever hear from them.    I was lucky to be on air once with john and Jeff in 2001. also lucky to have seen and hear everyone for the last time today over the Internet. they had live video of everyone. at one point frank started to cry and everyone went to go Hug them.      As lame and gay as this sounds it was really sad to watch it. 97.1 fm was always there to make my day go by faster.         They will all be missed and I hope I get to hear them all soon again. especially Frosty, Hedi and Frank.         R.I.P. 97.1 FM TALK RADIO.    :O(       Chris.

20090220221034AAZWHiR	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think he likes me......?	Well... there is a guy... that I like. But, I don't think he likes me...      I don't want to ask him out, and he already has a girlfriend. But sometimes, I'll see him looking at me. I can't read his expression, he looks away to quick. But other times he just glances, so I barely see him.      Today, in third period, when he was done his test, he looked at me for a while. And in the library, it was almost like his friends and him were following me where I looked, they went past me a few times. And before they walked on, they talked to me for a minute, and before I walked away, it was like the guy I like looked deep into my eyes. But you know, it was as I was turning away, so I only saw a bit...      But he glances at me all the time. And recently, he has been walking closer to me in the halls (he never talks to me though).   But its not like I can go up to him and talk. I don't know if his friends (which I *have* talked to before) would let it down.       I am confident I am just looking too far into it, but what do you think? And what should I do?      (I feel stupid asking this.)

20090220185505AAVxm4l	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Sort of a weird question about singing?	so i love singing, but i have really bad habits and im just starting to break them. Before, when i sang, i would just speak in melody with my regular speaking voice and i sounded flat and 1 dimensional and not to mention the tonality was disguisting. Anyway, i've been experimenting with different keys and stuff and i think i've finally found out how to sing properly. When I sing now, it feels like the top of my mouth is open, and i can breath easier from my diaphragm and my notes are smoother. I'm my own biggest critic, so ofcourse i hate the way my voice sounds, but my question is, am i now singing correctly?  Is your singing voice supposed to be "above" your speaking voice? By "above", i mean is it supposed to feel like it's at the top of the back of your mouth? cuz thats what it feels like to me now...thanks!!!

20090220180027AAyAf2m	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	AAHHHHH!! AFI Summer Tour?	I was expecting a new album out in 2011 or 2012...not 2009. This is awesome. I'm (probably) getting concert tickets for my birthday and that will be my first show.    http://www.blender.com/Blender-Blog/blog...  (scroll down until you see Hunter).      I know this has been asked a billion times, but just so I don't violate the guidelines, my question is...What do you think the new album will sound like? What do you want it to sound like?      People are saying it will sound like Black Sails in the Sunset. Honestly, I hope it doesn't. I love Black Sails, but I don't think they can pull it off again now that AFI's different as people, and even their main influences have changed. It will probably sound too forced. I think they're done with the punk thing and I want something new. I'm also hoping for less electronic elements.

20090220185525AAjT64V	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Do you listen to '80s alternative or modern rock?	Now this was the music that I grew up to (b. 1978). If this were "alternative" to something, it could be those glam-rock hair bands. Examples are Depeche Mode, New Order, Talking Heads, The Clash, The Smiths, Velvet Underground, etc. & I think in the '90s, assuming that Nirvana, Pearl Jam, & Soundgarden got tiresome (still regularly played on Krab Radio here in Bakersfield), I think such alt. rock artists were Erasure, Feeder, Urge Overkill, Tori Amos, etc. +, WOXY.com has one streaming audio channel called WOXY Vintage. R.E.M & Radiohead are also good examples but that's only if you exclude any "greatest hits" that get ruined by constant radio airplay. I'd like 2 hear from some musicophiles who are fans of this type of modern rock that's been around for 2? decades.

Smith because how hard he tried to be with Samantha, when she left him for another guy at a club, he waited all night long just to make sure she got home safely. When she got cancer, even though his hair was his thing he shaved it off to make her feel better. He is definitely adorable. But, Aiden is like everything I look for in a guy. Loves nature, loves animals, would rather stay in & eat chinese food than go to a crazy party. Wouldn't ever cheat on a girl, is a serious softie. AWW i love aiden!! lol

20090220181751AAQ4WSQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What meanings do you gather from the lyrics of this song?	peacebone- animal collective      A peacebone got found in the dinosaur wing   I've been jumping all over but my views are slowly shrinking   I was a Jugular vein in a juggler's girl   I was supposedly leaking the most interesting colors   While half of my fingers are dipped in the sand   You progress in letters, but you're used to cooking broccoli   The other side of take out is mildew on rice   And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly   Only a few things are related to the "old times"   Then we did believe in magic and we did die   It's not my words that you should follow, it's your insides   You're just an inside   Adjust your insides   You're just an inside      I'll bet the monster was happy when they made him a maze   'Cause he don't understand intentions, he just looks at a face   I'll bet the bubbles exploded to tickle the bath   All the birds are very curious, all the fish are at the surface   With half of me waiting for myself to get calm   I'm like a pelican at red tide, I'm a corpse, I'm not a fisherman   And a blowout does not mean I will have a good night   'Cause an obsession with the past is like a dead fly   And just a few things are related to the "old times"   When we did believe in magic and we did die   It's not my words that you should follow, it's your insides   You're just an inside   Adjust your insides   You're just an inside      I start in a hose and I'll end in a yard   When I feel like I'm stealing I can't keep myself from hearing God   Only the taste of your cooking can make me bow on the ground   It was the clouds that carved the mountains, it was the mountains that made the kids scream   Oh well she bore all her parts but she never was found   You think "I'll carve a path through New York and be an artist", but are you anything?   Then you find out you can't ask a baby to cry   And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly   And just a few things are related to the "old times"   When we did believe in magic and we did die   It's not my words that you should follow, it's your insides   You're just an inside   Adjust your insides   You're just an inside

I don't know all about hunting either but still lol.

[This is an opinionated question and answer, just so ya know.]      First of all: What is the best Metallica song you believe ever to have been made?      And also: What is the best Unforgiven? One, two or three?      I like the second the best, and the best Metallica song is for sure Enter Sandman, One, or the newer one, Broken Beat & Scarred.      These are my opinions, and I'm only a 12 yr. old girl! What are yours?

20090220202031AAHyR82	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What are your favorite song lyrics against America/the war?	i would have to pick "Collapse the War Engine" by Architect.          The gears of the war machine spin.   Always forward endlessly driving forever onward.   Never slowing down.   History repeats over and over.   Explode.   Implode.   Faulting.   Failing.   From tooth and nail to nuclear arms the results are all the same.   Explode.   Implode.   Faulting.   Failing.   The reminders are the trademarks.   The accounts of being dragged through unescorted hell.   Told by the innocent passerby that did not embrace the great machine.   The destroyer of human understanding.   Feeds on complacent ignorance.   We will no longer pimp fuel to the flame.   But at what price.   I beg the question.   What purpose does drive this engine.   When will this machine collapse.   Never.         how about you guys?       id prefer if you gave a metal song, that way i could relate more, but give me whatever you feel.

I have been a confirmed rock fan since I was a kid, and my tastes have ranged far and wide. On that journey, I have come across some songs which are supposed to be "super sexy", you know, the "me love you long time" songs, which are actually absolutely side-splitting in their hilariousness. Sometimes, if you're lucky enough to see the videos, it's the super sexy smoldering looks from the band. Other times it's the ridiculously silly lyrics.       Here are a few of my favorites:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_9rURZMU...       ~Kiss, "I Was Made for Lovin' You Baby"       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odqZAGNvx...       ~AC/DC, "Let Me Put My Love Into You"      (I mean, really, "Let me cut your cake with my knife"? That's precious!)      Please share some of yours with me. I could use a good laugh.      Thanks

The only lyrics that I know are "close your eyes" and they also say "give me your hand". It is an eighties songs (I say must have been released in late 1980's), and it is sung by a male singer. I had asked my mother about the song and she told me that it is one of those songs that have no words, but she said it was released again later with words (if that helps)...   Thank you!         It an instrumental song... and I think that keyboards were used...   It's also a medium to fast pace...

GRRRR!! someone else felt the same way right?    Do you think Juliet is gonna give up, or is Shaun gonna drop Abigail for Jules?

I am an American by the way. I am not trying to offend anyone.      How about you guys? Feel any differently?

20090220192121AAMz0Z2	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why do celebrities make more money then regular hard working people?	Why do celebrity teens and adults make more money then the people who are actually helping the world? All they do is act or sing and that's it! There are fire fighters, teachers, scientists, doctors, and police women/men who are working harder but suffering more because of some of the low wages that are given to them. They all work day and night trying to help keep the economy going and trying to keep people in this world alive. When they get home, they have to pay the bills and clean and take care of their family too. Since taxes and prices are going up, their wages might not even be enough and soon they will have to probably live on the streets and be homeless. I know that they make movies and songs and they get more money then us because a lot of people buy their products but shouldn't the people who work to save others live deserve some attention too? Or at least some extra help so that they won't develop as much stress in their lives? I think that something has to be done about their earnings so that we can help the economy and provide equality throughout the society.

20090220201423AAnhS5X	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Just a few questions about the Bleach manga?	I have watched the Bleach anime all the way up to episode 100. I was thinking about reading the manga from where I left off, but I have a few questions about it.   In the anime, after Rukia's rescue, there starts this thing with the Bounts invading the Soul Society. Does that happen in the manga? Cuz I was flipping through it in a book store and I didn't see anything in there about the Bounts.   How many volumes long is it?    I feel like I'm wasting my time watching this anime. It drags out for so long and I hear that there's already 200 episodes. Do you think it would be better to read the manga? What's your personal opinion of it?   All answers are appreciated. Thank you! :)

And why would I waste my time typing up this long message? :( I'm a Cancer and I can't believe I'm being treated this way ... and I can't believe I've never cried once. Maybe that's because my moon and rising sign are both Capricorn which probably cancels out my emotions. But yeah, who knows.

With my left hand I need to play the g# note on one octave() and then play the g# minor chord on an octave higher. then I need to go back to the 1st octave to play the d# note and then play the d# major chord on the higher octave but the thing is I keep missing especially on the g# minor chord.      the way I play them is that I play the middle note with my thumb, the 3rd note with the index finger and the 1st note with my pinky finger. should I do that or use a different fingering method to play those chords? if it helps this is sort of what Im talking about    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm0R6djB7...       go to 1:14 and look at how the hand jumps from one octave to the next. this is what I want to do for the piece Im playing.

Why did the clone troopers have to follow orders anyway?.How were they programed or taught or born or what ever to betray the jedi and how?.      because i find it weird if you look at the relationship between Commander Cody and Obi-wan.Its really respectfull and in the movie when order 66 is orderd cody orderd an atte to fire at obi wan.   Then later he says he wants to see a bodie.      To me its weird some clone troopers have feelings and others are order to do what they were born to do.If they were born to fight for the repbulic then why are they killing their own geneals or so forth?

It was a movie about a war (definitely European)... but to be honest I'm really not sure which countries, anyways The plot mainly revolved around a boy, he might have been about 11? he had been separated from his parents and ended up in a 'mission center' or maybe it was just a 'safe house'? and I remember that He was with 2 men and they had limited resources and told the boy "We dont have enough rice for you so go away" but he ended up staying with them, and after some time had passed he wanted to return to his abandoned colonial mansion and he found a box of chocolates that belonged to his parents and ate some..      sorry that It's so vague but It's really important that I figure this out, and thanks so much in advance for your answers :)

20090220205842AATx6Yz	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	Which "Are you afraid of the dark" episode?	I remember watching the TV show "Are you afraid of the dark" a couple times when I was younger. I'm looking a certain episode, but the only thing I remember about it was two kids in a creepy, brightly colored room. One of them wasn't talking, and was trying to signal the other kid not to talk either. It had something to do with something "bad" happening if you talked.       Of course, it's also possible this is from some other show or movie. But it's driving me crazy trying to remember. If you have any idea what I'm talking about, whether it be the name of the episode or even any other details from the episode, it'd be much appreciated. Thanks!

20090220215828AAUgNJT	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	POLL: Wierdest Childhood memory?	what's ur wierdest memory as a kid?      Mine: when i was in 2nd or 3rd grade, i saw "the ring," and as a kid i got really freaked out by those movies. so i kept having nightmares that samara (ghost from "the ring") would crawl out of my bathroom toilet like she did out of the well, and then she'd strangle me. I was affraid to go the the bathroom, so i had to run past my bathroom so she wouldn't catch me! It took me, like, 2 months to get over it!      I laugh at the f**ked up child i was now bacuse i've changed so much (i love horror movies now)

20090220215251AAKGCc3	Entertainment & Music;Movies	A movie about faries, another about dragons?	lmao k so I cant remember much of it other than there was a boy who found these faries I guess and befriended them... :P that's all I can recall (it seemed to be set in 80s-90s?)      Oh there was another movie about these 2 girls who found these faries in the forest and they had to keep them a secret from everyone but eventually rumors started to spread and they had to tell their secret and no one believed them?(it was shot in a pretty old fashioned setting idk 1940s?)      And the one about the dragons had was visually pretty monotone and was about this city and it was underground? or walled off maybe? anyways in the opening scene a there are 2 people coming up in a mine shaft? and there's an explosion? and yeah outside of the city there's dragons? and they needed to use the the dragons for something? I think it was called something along the lines of "the city of fire" or something like that   (I know for sure that it's not the city of ember)   however it was surprisingly similar.      thanks in advance, and ill be sure to give full points to the best answer.
