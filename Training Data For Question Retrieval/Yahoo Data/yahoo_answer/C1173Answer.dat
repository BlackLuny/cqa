Luego la falda cortita medias de nilon y luego en los pies no se si pueda aguantar tacos sino cualquier calzado. Obvio si lo sacas a pasear asi prestale un bolso .... jajajaja tendra cosas que llevar. Espero que en tu ciudad no haga frio.

Obvio, bien maquillado, labios ni hablar, super rojos, peluca. Sino una calza de esas gruesas bien ce?ida con una musculosa de lycra y encima una remera larga y escotada con unos zapatos con taco alto. En ambos casos, fundamental una tanga, corpi?o, body o corset interior con push-up relleno con medias cancan. Lo gracioso va a ser verlo caminar con su peluca, sus labios rojos y como se le marcan su bulto y su cola, jajaja. Si la idea es disimular y que quede lo mas femenino posible, entonces tendria que usar pollera ce?ida y cortita con una calza corta debajo q le achate el bulto. Un portaligas tambien estaria barbaro. En ese caso podria ser tambien una polera de lycra apretada o una musculosa con una camperita al cuerpo encima para que le estilice el cuello. Que divertido!, jajaj, invitameeee. Yo lo tendria atado a la espalda para que no se pueda cambiar y se quede asi vestido y maquillado el dia entero. Despues lo sacaria asi a pasear.

If you want your hair to look a natural color you could try using lemon juice or Sun-In in your hair and you'll get highlights from the sun or just ask them to highlight your hair a little while your at the salon.

What looks bad to me is if you are wearing a cool color on one, say a cool pink on fingernails, and you have a warm color on toes like an orangey red. That just looks tacky.|`|25o6OZxQaa	always|`|Ea7uPuYYaa	not always :)|`|ZKWYVhfXaa	Yes and no.<br>  <br>  It would look bad if you had pink on your toes and red on your hands. <br>  <br>  Here is when you can mix:<br>  <br>  Anytime you have french you can have whatever color you want on the other.<br>  <br>  Right now I have pink on toes and french on fingers.|`|bHELlgceaa	of course not hun. but its cute when it does match.|`|6kgmcKgWaa	I think it should-I think it looks better|`|AA11001911	absolutely. just make sure that both colors somewhat match or compliment your outfit. not everything has to be perfectly in sync but it shoulf flow together. good luck sweetie. just do whatever you like|`|Jg6lfj6saa	Girl, your socks don't even have to match. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.|`|LITtXW2zaa	Mine doesn't match...<br>  I usually put a brighter/more vivid color on my toes.|`|PQ1tr6mhaa	no i think it would be cute if u had french style on ur toes and a single color on ur hand.|`|WqqDw3PCaa	yes|`|i8Kpxqzvaa	Not always. It just depends on the look you are going for and the colors you have picked. And more importantly how YOU like your nails...|`|j1OreBEoaa	Nope.  But if you're planning on doing two different colors, make sure they don't clash.  For example, if you do a dark red on your fingers, and then decide to do a more orange-y red on your toes -- that would clash, stick to one  shade of red.  For spring and summer, a light pink or french manicure on fingers, and a cherry red on toes is a perfect example of how to mix and match nail polish colors.  Hope this helped!|`|jrJtgHZFaa	No way! I think it is weird when people do match it! I say make fingers mismatch if thats what you like. No one will judge you because everyone knows that everyone has a personal style. My personal style is to make them all different and bright colors! Im the cool girl at school that makes fashion statements and starts new trends! By the way, the new in thing is knee socks with stripes!! Hope this helps!|`|klbOueuHaa	if u want it to it can but if u do not than dont|`|lOglnZNMaa	They don't have to... But I prefer mine to be the same. If I want different, I will do french on fingers and red or bright color on toes with a white flower or something.

h8ZRUUNnaa	FIRST OF ALL, u can't compare louisiana to indian people thats  two different cultures. Well, some indians don't believe in bathing regularly, like we do in western society, because of their religious beliefs so that can contribute to body odor. Also, they use alot of curry and tamarian (probably spelled it wrong) in their cooking so it gives off an odor as well. Have u smelled the tamarian spice! OMG, it spells very bad to me, i don't see how anyone would want to cook with that, but they apparently love it.|`|24b7777aca4b76d01fd21f31ae89e4ecaa	i think people like to just categorize people and its not nice! i honestly don't think Indian people stink . some people may not be use to different smells so they like to make fun.|`|7a2UONWbaa	I'm half Indian and i don't smell....who ever said that is a rude stupid little prick who probably stinks themselves!!!
0HXclnCXaa	probably both...but i get that muffin top too. i think everybody does...shoot, i have it right now lol|`|jKfuz9LAaa	They have to fit for both.  If a particular pair of jeans are bad, wear a shirt that goes down to cover anything showing.<br>  <br>  LOL.|`|7523ce74244307451b341958873c6d98aa	Both. When I go to try on Jeans I always do the sit down and bend test. If they look great when I try them on and am standing, then I bend at the waist to make sure that they are not too low rise and my **** isn't hanging out. If that's okay, Then I sit on the little stool in fitting room, to make sure that they don't ride down too far. So I say they need to fit both standing and sitting. if you have the muffin top effect though, maybe you should try a little higher rise jean. Don't go for the super low cut/rise jeans, try a mid-rise jean. Hope this helps.|`|jjrG77Uyaa	when I buy jeans I like to sit down to see how they look and feel... cause thats what I though the little stool or wood thing was for haha and I know that sometimes when I sit down with jeans they get all scrunched in the crotch area and look funny and yes even I get a muffin top and everything thinks I'm like bone thin so just hike up the jeans before you sit... haha and I don't think anyone looks at a muffin top when you sit... So I think they should fit when your standing if they're just like out on the town jeans and sitting for school... because mostly you sit alot in school.... HIH|`|9QhP6JpDaa	there suppost to fit for both<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081008150042AApYfQZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|dUxWVfK4aa	when you sitt it gets a bit harder to put them on |`|wOGU0V6Jaa	Personally, which I know is rather odd, but I have to admit I kind of like a slight muffin top look for a girl. Some would say that this is taboo, however, I think that the presence of the muffin top means that a girl has a bit of curve to her that looks absolutely gorgeous standing up, all proportioned and sitting down is a non natural position.If you have a wonderful personality and a muffin top, you may find yourself being considered a real and natural woman and that is coveted by many men. I personally enjoy this look. For the man in your life and your happiness sake, please do not wear granny jeans because if you look gorgeous standing up, your going to look gorgeous in any other position to the man that appreciates you.|`|oQU8CFUiaa	both everyone gets muffin top cause your stomach pops out when your sitting<br>  answer mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AislIgbH4o214aSDok96SaANxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20081008144351AAYklP6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7X680xddaa	both but most ppl have it so u dont really have to worry no one will notice

IOAnBHKAaa	wear anything which u like in which u feel comfortable <br>  if it seems boring <br>  then wear something cathing|`|7pqSoHVdaa	SInce your body shape does not fit most dresses, I wouldn't shop online - those dresses are cut for the same standard body shape.  Instead, try department stores where you can find good deals on nice dresses at cheaper prices.  <br>  If you buy clothes online, you HAVE to be sure it'll fit you and since it is difficult to dress your body shape, I wouldn't do it.  Usually if dress is smaller in hips, it's pretty small in boobs too and you may end up falling out or showing too much.

I know it's difficult if it itches. Try not to touch it for 24 hours. your hair is probably traumatized right now. Give your scalp a chance to heal a little.

Don't be embaressed of addressing the problem. I had my hair fall out from my mom's friend at a salon. She chemicall straightened my hair, and it didn't work.

9c087cb92c2b43d04d7ba092812e9d32aa	don't go blonde-it would look a little weird with your coloring and complextion considering usually only people with 'dirty blonde' hair or any shades of blonde can pull off that color.  especially since i'm sure you have dark eyebrows and darker skin it would look kind-a fake.<br>  <br>  as for the second hair cut- i don't particularily like that style and to pull it off, you have to have the make-up, clothes, etc.  it's an expensive style and after you have that hair cut without the rest of the package, you might not like having that cut anymore, but it's hard to get rid of that style of hair considering some of the layers are cut so short.   plus it's hard to get that haircut smooth and shinny without straightening it 3 times a day- and that just ruins your hair and you get a bunchof split ends.<br>  <br>  if you want a change, you can cut to about you shoulders, layer it softly around your face and for colors, you can get some carmel or other shades of brown highlights in your hair.<br>  <br>  maybe something similar to this:<br>  <a href="http://www.theblogyoulovetohate.com/images/large/anne%20hathaway/Anne-Hathaway-LSPost.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.theblogyoulovetohate.com/imag...</a>|`|5G7dIIEwaa	second one<br>  <br>  but the second one <br>  u HAVE to strighten ur hair every day<br>  <br>  oh and u have to put in extensions EVERYDAY. becuase hte long part isnt ur hair its extensions.<br>  <br>  if ur lazy it might be a pain for u to striten ur hair everyday.<br>  <br>  but if ur up for that then get the scene hair=)|`|cSIOyj4maa	The only way you'd be able to achieve that look is if you use a straigtener and lots of hairspray.

HZQby0y3aa	Hey!<br>  if you have recently got your ears pierced its probably still a little sore.<br>  I have had my ears pierced for 5 years now and i can not have my earings out for over a week else it gets very painful to take out. Mainly because the person who pierced it, pierced it to low.<br>  Also you should go to a drug store, they will recommend this antiseptic spray for your ears that will help the pain =)<br>  hope i helped!|`|uhc1MCDzaa	 If your ear that hurts gets red and swollen that could be an infection beginning. Developing pus is a certain symptom.<br>  <br>  In either case I suggest warm water and mild soap washing daily. <br>  You might use hydrogen proxide.<br>  If none of that works, you should go to a doctor.|`|68cJAuubaa	it swells up for days and there is hardly any blood that surfaces to the area.<br>  blood is a sign of the piercing healing cause that means there is constant blood flow to the area that bring good bacteria to the area to heal it.<br>  There is usually a spray you purchase when you get your ears pierced and that stop any infection.<br>  different parts of your body take different reactions to certain metals so dont worry. There is nothing wrong with your ear at all unless you cant touch it cause its that sore there is no problem.|`|LQ0KndzYaa	if it gets all lumpy and itchy then it's infected. it should b a little sore after u get it pierced. if ur ear hole is infected, go to the doctor and they will give u medicine to put on every night. i kept my earing in but if u want, u can take it out. but if ur allergic to it, then u should take it out.<br>  <br>  i just noticed something else too... we have the same names! :D|`|4186a715110a5f2e52b3846e0ecf2554aa	if it gets crusty and nasty it's probably infected. if it's just sore it's more than likely not infected. I wouldn't wear anything but gold. The people at wal-mart told me to use a little antibiotic ointment around the holes (don't take the earrings out though) to prevent infection.|`|fMTv7y3waa	it depends on how badly the site is.  if it itches or u see something diff appear there or stuff oozing out then yeah...i remember having an ear infection just because i was wearing buds instead of hoops or dangling.  I think u should seek for professional help if it gets worst or doesn't go away in 2~3 days.

F3qzBMInaa	i usually dont go for answering these questions with a "oh i like this shirt" "get this shirt" bla bla. i tend to give you examples of each shirt and what look you can get with it, then you can chose by your own personal taste. <br>  1) looks good on thin, and not so thin people. i am not sure how long it is, but i think with some bright colored leggings it could look nice, or a dark legging if you want to go for the darker look. a little belt in the middle would work. this is kinda a girl girl dress/shirt thing.<br>  2) a simple tee, very versatile, you dont need me to tell you what to pair this with...can be used for a girl girl look, emo look, edgy look, and pretty much all the cliche's there are. or you can pair it whatever and make it just go unique. <br>  <br>  price wise, i think that $10 for the tee is a steal for aeropostale clothes.<br>  about $23 is decent for a shirt/dress thing like that. |`|dF08mbFyaa	2/3! i <3 it|`|AA10343094	2. with some big necklaces, flats, and skinny jeans.<br>  <br>  edit:: 3, definitly. accessorize, though!|`|GSVJyvrnaa	2/3 [same thing]<br>  Number 1 is ugly!.  =]]|`|AA11901859	2 and 3 are the same, but that one|`|GAsBogQuaa	2 and 3 (since there the same)|`|PgQui4jNaa	2/3. 1 isn't my thing.|`|jKfuz9LAaa	Assuming you have black hair (like your avatar) I would say either 1 or 3.<br>  <br>  Depends on what your style is.

MNhd0Vc0aa	The least painful one is not getting it done at all...<br>  <br>  Why would you want to pay for a piece of metal inside your skin?<br>  <br>  I find piercings stupid.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	No, it's not necessarily the least painful.  Pain is relative and different for everyone.  You should get a piercing somewhere because that's where you want it, not because you want a piercing and you've heard that place is the least painful.

jzE6FMawaa	That depends... are you trying them on because they fit better than men's gloves, or are you doing it just for the thrill of it?<br>  <br>  The fit-better reasoning is actually legitimate, because there are many women's gloves that, if worn by a man, would certainly look fine.  I've tried on women's gloves before as a serious thinking-about-purchasing-these proposition before where the men's gloves were all too big, and sadly, the women's gloves didn't fit right, either, being too small.  So I lost all around on that one.<br>  <br>  Now if you're just trying them on for the thrill, that's your business, I suppose, but I've seen stranger.|`|Hs9RVG1gaa	HAHAHAHAH lol i dont think i would even notice or care, but thats funny.|`|AA10491484	if the women seen you a couple of times within 1 or 2 months then maybe it should be questioned.

You are only pervert if you are!  <br>  I was looking for gloves that i wanted last year but kinda broke. So yesterday i went to ***** searching high and low to find the exact or similar material i found last year. I found the ones i like but most are in women size so i tried them for size.

1KkHCjVWaa	i have both my nose and my tongue pierced and the tongue was by far less painful!!!<br>  <br>  sounds ridiculous! but having your tongue pierced doesnt hurt at all!!! its because your tongue is a muscle, so when the needle pierces it instead of just piercing straight through and cutting everything inside of it, the muscle separates and makes way for the needle. unless you're tensing your tongue up.|`|0inrBrazaa	I don't have my nose pierced (and never have) but I used to have my tongue pierced - and it hurt some... but not the worse pain ever. I got it spray numbed on the top and didn't feel anything until the very end when they had already gone through the top, and it was coming out the bottom - I thought they had just started and going from bottom to top of tongue.. (I had my eyes closed)<br>  <br>  I only had trouble eating (and talking!!!) right after because my tongue was so swollen! I sucked on ice, which is kinda like hard candies, right away and that helped.  Never had any trouble with foods, only sometimes did something and I can't even remember now exactly what it was, would catch the back of the ring and pull it up but you get used to it after a while and then it feels normal to have something in your mouth on your tongue at all times.  I took it out once and my tongue/mouth felt realllllly weird. <br>  <br>  **The only thing I had trouble doing was kissing, like french kissing my boyfriend and was actually the reason I ended up taking it out.  I couldn't really get my tongue all the way out, unless you lift it up and over your bottom front teeth, to get the bottom part of the ring over your teeth and that was doing too much, and made it not happen without being fully aware of what my tongue was/would be doing.|`|AA11114146	I have my nose and my tongue.<br>  I would say the nose just made my eyes water alot, and the tongue made me slobber a little. Lol.<br>  I just got my tongue about a week and a half ago and it feels fine already. <br>  I pierced my tongue myself twice, this is my third time, the worst part that hurts is wen the needle goes threw the bottom of your tongue if you push it down from the top. & I would say the healing hurts most of all, but it only lasts a couple days. Chew on crushed ice alot.<br>  I'd say for the first week it's hard to eat alot of things, don't eat hard candies at first you can hit your barbell and can hurt like a b*tch, Lol.<br>  <br>  Just eat soft things and you'll be fine and evetually you'll graduate to harder foods.<br>  Just remember cold soft things are best. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  xx<br>  |`|M3muPz6aaa	No, it does not hurt!!<br>  I wouldn't know about the nose, because I don't have that, but I've heard it hurts more then the tongue. But tongue really doesn't hurt, I got mine three weeks ago...they did not numb it[which i hear numbing isn't a good idea anyways, you bleed more], and when they stuck the needle through, it felt like getting a shot at the doctors basically. piece of cake. for 3 days though i couldent speak right....i had a lisp hahaha. <br>  <br>  Eating the first time was hard, i tried eating ramen, and it was so hard to get it around the bar, cause i wasnt used to it. but after a few days, eating became easier.<br>  i wouldn't know about hard candies, because i dont eat anything like hard candies. but it wouldn't be hard if you sucked on it, not biting it till it heals.|`|REmSocXUaa	yeah i did just ask that.<br>  and iv never gotten my nose pierced but the tongue hurts a little but while its healing your gonna be eating like an old lady lol and your tongue you will not be able to move your tongue or it will hurt.<br>  and yeah u cant eat spicy foods<br>  and no it will hurt to suck on hard candy and once healed it will just be wierd cuz there is a piece of meddle in the middle of your tongue whish is where u suck on things|`|gOGwVm5eaa	About the same afterward, but enduring the actual piercing, is much worse. i dont have my nose pierced, but i do have my cartilage pierced.|`|azswXRDBaa	Well I'd say that a tongue piercing probably hurts more simply because its a muscle and much thicker... Though I wouldn't know... That's just what would make sense to me...|`|xv3opX9Maa	yes it does hurt but lemme tell you the peircing itself wasnt so bad i mean i though it was at the time <br>  it hurts for like a week after and you cant really eat  anything solid for a while <br>  and i chipped my tooth on it and it hurt SOOO FUKCING BAD!!!!! like 10 times worse then the piercing did <br>  ( =|`|tfqpb5XQaa	No. <br>  I've had more then 20 piercings, including tongue and nose, and out of all of them, I'd say tongue hurt the least.<br>  Although, afterwards for about a week it does hurt while it is swollen, and its pretty hard to eat for a few days.<br>  But if you want it, get it :) its a really good piercing, it heals really fast and most people can change the bar within two weeks, I changed mine after a week and had no problems with it  :)|`|p6CbQKzQaa	No the initial piercing really isn't bad. I barely felt it. The swelling afterwards hurts a bit until the piercing is healed but it is nothing unbearable. Taking ibuprofen and eating and drinking cold things will help with the swelling and pain. I would say the nose definitely hurts more. No I don't have any troubles eating certain foods except lollipops. Hard candies are difficult to eat though. Since it is in the middle of your tongue it is hard to find a spot to put the candy. I have never chipped a tooth or anything though, and other than the hard candy thing I love my tongue ring and think it's totally worth it. |`|qAkLi8oQaa	i have my tongue pierced and the actual piercing didnt hurt it was after when it swelled up and tried to talk...i dont know about the nose but the one time i saw it get done the girl started to cry and her nose started to bleed...think it was the piercers fault or somethin i dont know i would def go with the tounge over nose anytime|`|DhmUgq0maa	Nope, you just feel a little pop when it goes through but it's not painful just weird, until about 4 hours after then it starts to get sore and for the next few days you can only eat mushy food like spagetti or potato, a few days after its done it stops hurting an once your used to having it in you'll be able to eat whatever you want.<br>  <br>  I had mine done about 4 yrs ago an now i forget i even have it.<br>  In my opinion when i got my nose done urt more than my tounge|`|pKBCzK5Waa	it does definetly hurt,<br>  not so much as soon as you get it done.<br>  but, after and hour or two.<br>  you'll be like what zee fack?!<br>  <br>  i never had my nose pierced.<br>  but i think it would hurt more.<br>  concidering it's you're effin' tounge, man.<br>  ahhah.

The gladiator straps may be a bit too much, but they add that 'rawr' factor in for me.<br>  <br>  Finally, I hope that you are just wearing them now to try them on and take pics, because if you plan to wear them the entire day then I would have to ask where you are going? They look nice, but for special or formal occasions and gatherings. You may even want to bring a pair of comfy shoes along with you just in case you can only tolerate so many hours of walking around them.<br>  <br>  Other than that, as long as you love them, and can wear them comfortably and with confidence, we would love to see you in them.|`|jGuIOvapaa	hhaha they look like hooker heels <br>  but they're cute i guess if you wear them with skinny jeans and a flowy top. hair down like natural|`|9dab0ec84889ed79d2294c7f79b69f3eaa	awesome whore shoes<br>  yayyyy|`|BWVDKixeaa	There is sexy and then there is trampy... they are trampy.|`|55V4W0oLaa	yeah, they look pretty hot.<br>  <br>  if you don't stop being so hot, then I'm going to have to hit on you|`|QBWiPLVnaa	no :)|`|lfhgTUcEaa	i love them|`|mX09edPaaa	i sooo love it!<br>  :)|`|MVhhwshKaa	definitely cute i would wear them if i didn't think i would twist my ankle in them lol but they're very cute|`|Y73fpqo3aa	love them they are nice.good for a sixteen year old girl|`|182defe841baeb406682182cc8675475aa	Mmmmight be sending messages that you don't wanna send...<br>  <br>  Unless you really want a lot of male attention.

Q2t5fPNAaa	My sister has the same problem! I take her to second hand or thrift stores (like Goodwill) to find jeans that fit. She has the best luck there, because they are worn in to fit her body opposed to buying new pants to find that they fall down way too much once she breaks them in. Plus, they're inexpensive. If you find a good pair that are a little big, you can buy them for next to nothing and have them tailored.<br>  <br>  If thrift stores arent your style, i would suggest Gap, Marshalls, TJ Maxx or buying Guess jeans. Try to avoid department stores, because they usually only sell stretch jeans (like angels brand) and stretch jeans rip a lot, and dont last. Their better quality jeans are often over priced. If you try Old Navy, be sure to try everything on, and make sure you can move around comfortably, so try not to purchase jeans online unless your 110% sure that they will fit.|`|yH5bMdWBaa	i have the same shape as you, and i found that pacsun jeans fit pretty well. i wear a size 3 there (i'm 110 lb) and they're pretty comfy|`|GwB74Dmwaa	Guess<br>  Lucky <br>  Pacsun|`|yzTMKrfIaa	Here are some suggestions and examples, including links to some great jeans for curvy / small waisted women: <a href="http://www.jeanshub.com/SmallWaist-CurvyJeans.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeanshub.com/SmallWaist-Curvy...</a>|`|35c3df911f84beff6b1fc6dff3df6190aa	jcpenny

l74RoxUDaa	You won't ever get your long hair back.  Not this way.<br>  <br>  The layers you put in mean that you can no longer control the splits, and this will stop the growth.  The only thing you can do is to cut your hair to your shortest layer, even if this adds several years to your waiting time.  It may be less drastic to do it in stages, but once hair is in layers it will not grow unless it is really looked after and in good health.  I despair when girls choose to cut their hair about because it is unlikely ever to be nice again without a lot of effort.<br>  <br>  Hairdressers love layers because it then ties you to going back over and over again.  They also prefer short hair because long hair means fewer trips to the hairdressers, and less business for them.<br>  <br>  Once you have remedied the damage done by the layers, you must simply not cut your hair.  For years.  Avoid hairdressers like the plague.  Even if you are bored with a look, you have to stick with it, and not think you can go scene or go for a cute side bang or choppy layers, or you will be back to square one again.<br>  <br>  You do microtrims, not more than 1/4 inch at a time, simply to keep the splits at bay, and treat it like a baby.<br>  <br>  It will take about 5 years to get it to a nice length, so pencil in a date some time in 2013 to celebrate.|`|vZxC25hTaa	You have to let it grow out, that's all you can do<br>  Be patient and willing to wait<br>  :)|`|SJEfXu4yaa	Try giving your head a good massage right before you go to bed. Massage with the balls of your fingers in circular motions on your head and along your hairline. This increases circulation to your head resulting in faster hair growth.<br>  Also make sure your taking your vitamins you need and have a healthy nutrition. That effects hair growth as well.<br>  <br>  Tip; next time you go to get your hair trimmed, make sure you let them know how much you want off and make it loud and clear. If they cut too much off, complain about it. Dont just walk away, its your hair and your money. |`|Ic7NCqd6aa	go to a different hair salon with people who listen to you when you say you just want a trim.<br>  or learn to love your hairr(:|`|5CzWXtbiaa	Eat jello/gelatin products.|`|0ttm0KuPaa	you could try extensions or just leave it if that doesnt work cut tiny bits|`|5tnPty72aa	get a special shampoo that is specially made for "long hair". this happens to me too but I have split ends also.

Mdy3kTkkaa	I'm sorry about your brother.  I almost did something like that.  I was going to get my mother's name on my wrist after she died.  I took time to think about it and realized that a visible tattoo could risk my chances of the career I want to have.  You need to consider the big picture here.  Is a visible tattoo going to be a problem in the long run?  I think your tattoo idea is very honorable.  I'm tired of people talking about stars, flowers and butterflies as tattoos.  Maybe your shoulder, side, ankle, foot, or upper arm.  Think about it and make sure that it's exactly where you want it.<br>  Good luck.|`|6N9eV8IGaa	the wrist is cool, you could get it in white ink so you can only see it up close, i have a friend who did that, it turned out nice.|`|6QLPdPNmaa	That is so sweet can I suggest the upper part of your back near the shoulder|`|ZzVZltzNaa	is that what he would want? <br>  ankle would be my preference|`|kltRWD81aa	I think the wrist would be good.

Then wash it off completely and put on the finishing balm.<br>  this is what i use and it works absolutely fantastic! It is red at the end but for about 5-10 minutes.

kjrvUPcuaa	Well if you're talking about luxury goods and such that are made in France, then yes, they are cheaper to buy in Paris. Non-EU residents are also eligible to receive a value added tax refund (called a detaxe TVA in french) on the goods they purchase in France. To be eligible for the refund, you need to find a participating store and spend at the minimum 175 euros within that store on the same day.  |`|gRFUHrfBaa	i can't answer for sure, but my guess is no because a lot of places on the planet, not just the US, are suffering majorly economically. many things are going to be discounted or put on sale sooner or later...

qFZxnhCEaa	chyeahhh i do that all the time! =D its a lot easier to control i think and it look ssofter and less harsher than pencil i think. just wet your eyeliner** brush and make it damp, not soaking wet. than gather some eyeshadow on it and then line your eyes. make sure you use an eyeliner brush and not an eyeshadow brush or the ones that come with the eyeshadows. goodluck|`|MnoZNdI0aa	I do it all the time. A simple black eyeshadow will do,( or other color that you want) and all you need is a liner brush (The angled type usually works best). The difference from eyeshadow to eyeshadow are the their ingredients. Some will last longer and stay put, while others will have some fall-off in the corners of your eyes after an hour. The results aren't much different, MAC Fluid line is a liquid type eyeliner in a pot, that you can safely put on your waterline. It stays on forever, too. But if you use instead, a dark eyeshadow, there wouldn't be much of a difference in how it looks. Just remember to have a steady hand and to wipe off any little crumbs that fall off onto your cheeks and into the corners of your eyes. Also, you know those Dream Matte Mousse eye shadows by Maybelle? If you can find another shadow with the consistency of that, it will probably apply exactly the same as a cake/pot liner.<br>  3 years ago|`|mo8OfKjeaa	yes.<br>  <br>  its gonna work, but maybe use waterproof eyeliner on top?<br>  <br>  it helps keep ur makeup in place.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Yes just dont get it too wet.

I would suggest spending a few extra dollars and getting "Weather Anything" by Bare Excentuals.  It is like water, but actually allows shadow liner to stay put while wetting it to be applied smoother.  They also make great eyeline brushes, too.|`|7Wg8QdKeaa	It does! I have this Sunbaked Collection eyeshadow that you can wear dry or wet, as eyeshadow or as eyeliner and it's really nice.|`|AQo9Zuwwaa	Yep, that works! But, you'll need an eyeliner brush instead of an eyeshadow brush :)|`|7oetZ4I3aa	yes that can work apply foundation first or eyecream so it has something to cling to and last longer
baSks9O4aa	Her stylist is old fashioned and seriously needs to read a book. If a stylit ever tells you your hair will grow faster if you get it trimmed, WALK RIGHT OUT OF THERE. They are clearly ignorant. Hair grows from the root, not tip.<br>  <br>  I was tricked too, by my mom. To this very DAY she still believes it helps it grow faster (even though my growing hair is proof it doesn't since I don't trim. She does and her hair doesn't grow). <br>  <br>  The ONLY reason to cut your hair is if you are trying to get a certain style, length, or if you want to even out the ends for a neater appearance.<br>  <br>  My hair was thinning out too, and I started using protein treatments in it. I really like Doo Gros version. It's blue. Now my hair does not fall out from the roots, or break from the tips like it use to. I saw results after the very first use. But a word of advice: MAKE SURE YOU PUT A MOISTURIZING CONDITIONER AFTER RINSING OUT THE DOO GRO. If you don't the protein in it will dry out your hair and make it break!<br>  <br>  ADD: And another thing, whatever you do, do NOT let anyone convince you that your hair is damaged and must be cut off so you can "start over". This very rarely is actually necessary! Protein will build your hair back up and make the strand thicker and stronger. Protein is the ONLY thing that will bond to your hair. Hair products that advertise vitamins and minerals for strengthening hair are only trying to rip you off! They do not stick to the hair, they come out after being rinsed! Only protein becomes one with the hair!<br>  <br>  I hope all this helps you a lot. I wish someone had told me this before because my mom gave me really bad advice and ruined my hair!! But now I know what to do. E-mail me if you have any questions, I'd hate for you to have short hair like I did!|`|2V87n4PKaa	her stylist was a retard<br>  hair grows from the roots, not the ends<br>  so no matter how often you cut it, it wont affect how fast it grows|`|fufXCKnJaa	I wish someone had told me this when I was 13. <br>  <br>  Emu oil. It will stimulate your hair follicles and help it grow. People with alopecia use it and it helps. Use only natural oils. Absolutely no mineral oil!!! It will clog your pores and stop growth, though this is difficult to put into practice; most black hair products in stores contain mineral oil. Try jojoba oil or coconut oil; those are the best for your 'hair'.  Protein treatments can help with breakage, but too much will also break your hair; aphogee has some good ones.<br>  <br>  Also find a good shampoo. Once again, it's difficult to find these in your basic store (try Sally's or Amazon), and it might get a little expensive, but you wear your hair everyday. I think it's worth the investment.  <br>  <br>  I would go with emu oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, or coconut oil. Aphogee treatment to stop breakage. Stay from mineral oil products! I use Wen Cleansing Conditioner for washing and as a leave in conditioner.<br>  <br>  I've tried so many products. It's taken me years to find a good hair regimen!|`|EYOqHja1aa	it could be a diet problem. are both of you eating healthy? you are so young your hair should not fall out due to stress. avoid sugar and minimize your starch intake. eat lots of raw greens and some fruit, if it does not help see a doctor|`|aYdmXafbaa	Well then ur friend must be sick or probably wears a wig u never know but dis is a hard question so i cant help dat much|`|YuIuDCFfaa	cutting your hair does not work!!!!!!

Do you realize that there are people out there that can't afford ANY clothing. Why are you so obsessed with labeling yourself?<br>  <br>  YES, you can wear whatever you want!|`|yqVojuXVaa	If you're preppy? I don't think it matters if you're preppy or not. Lol

txGUBzR0aa	It really depends on the consistency of the makeup, usually for airbursh machines, the makeup should be thin, a bit runny so it goes on flawlessly, the manufacturer of your machine should have stated whether or not its alright to use any type of makeup,<br>  <br>  but it should be alright if the makeup is thin.
WiIUEObTaa	aloe vera gel unscented. retains colour. no irritation heals faster than ant other prescription , non prescription cream. always has been the best. Vitiam e oil is good but you pay a lot more slow healing . good luck|`|BcKCBzL8aa	bepanthen :)|`|ThLj52hpaa	benpathen (its a nappy rash cream) is the one your tattooist will recommend its about ￡2 and you can get it from most chemists or shops :)|`|YmXvERLtaa	I used Savlon, and found it worked REALLY well.<br>  Though many people say that bepanthen is very good also.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't suggest against vaseline as its greasy and won't let your skin breath. |`|4PDegJoyaa	use A&D and I used vaseline like winter defence or some crap. It was like the most moisturizing lotion they had and I got my in the end of june so it should still be out in stores. |`|jvLNWFPjaa	don't need any but if you must vaseline will do|`|G6oUQyZIaa	Savlon all the way, recomended by many tattooists I`ve used. The Choice of Champions! However all artists will suggest different things, the choice as they say is yours.<br>  I have used Witch Hazel in my time, would NOT suggest you do. Draws the colour, Itch`s worse than......well, something itchy!!!!!!|`|RGjejqspaa	WHEN IT IS JUST DONE YOU NEED TO USE A&D, NOT VASELINE!!!! THAT STUFF WILL MESS UP THE COLOR! AFTER 2-3 DAYS YOU SHOULD START USING LOTION THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANY ALOE, OR SMELL OR PETROLATUM IN IT!  THE ONLY LOTION THAT I HAVE FOUND SO FAR THAT WORKS THE BEST WAS CUREL CONTINUONUS COMFORT ( green design on the bottle)|`|qMCv8mOCaa	Nothing, especially petroleum-based creams like Vaseline and A&D!  Those keep the tattoo too "wet" which will cause the ink to leach out. <br>  <br>  Keep it clean and dry and use a small amount of lotion if you feel stiff or it itches. <br>  <br>  |`|FZFwbdZSaa	Tattoist now recommend benpathen to be used in new tattoo... You need to keep the skin moist so regular applications of it is advised.|`|73ee8ab233284b10735328bf3bd978d2aa	I was told to use a a dye & fragrance free lotion such as Lubriderm. Your tattoo artist should have given you a recommendation, so go with whatever they suggested.|`|I1Ieyqk8aa	my tattooist recommended bepanthen you can get it with the baby stuff in boots|`|8QyaCKGfaa	Bepanthen or any type of preventative cream that you would use for nappy rash.|`|AA11106082	Savlon defo healed my tattoo perfectly and quick|`|s3TcxMF5aa	Bepanthen...NOT vaseline!!!<br>  when the scab has dropped off,cocoa butter is very good!

tvsfvWKKaa	I LOVE long nails and so does my friend.<br>  We both grow our nails really long! Or try to!<br>  Right now my longest nail is JUST over half an inch.<br>  Remember your nails grow faster in summer than in winter.<br>  My nails break easily though! So i might depend on how long you can grow them. Like I said my longest is just over half an inch, and I think it took me about 7 weeks to grow it out!<br>  Be patient!|`|mBHQEzd1aa	I let mine grow until they are about one fourth of an inch then I usually end up breaking one and cut them back.  It starts getting hard to type or put the backs on my earrings any longer than this.  I don't know how long it would take for them to get one inch long...probably depends on the person.  I'll guess 4 months.  They will stay stronger if you keep polish on them.  Good luck with your bet.|`|vR6AwIppaa	omg i used to bite my nails all the time!<br>  then i started putting on really bad tasting nail polish and it helped me quit. they'll grow so you can see the white part in a few days.|`|mo8OfKjeaa	they grow much slower in the winter than the summer.<br>  also, another way to keep damaging them when theyre growing, is to wax/harden them. i forgot what its called. its like this gel thing. YES, its called gelling your nails.<br>  <br>  it will take around 2-3 months without even filing your nails.<br>  <br>  good luck!!!<br>  hope i helped (:|`|VihV4Troaa	mine grow like 1/16-1/8 an inch a week. they grow insanely fast and i hate it because i like stubby nails. :|<br>  to make your nails that long it can take 1-3 months for the average person probably.|`|42LovADyaa	wow an inch is really long and its going to take a while but if ur really set on doing that then i would get a nail hardener from like sallys beauty supply :)

I don't see any problem with this. I absolutely love the Jonas Brothers and they have the most awesome, eclectic style I've ever seen on guys... possibly even anyone else, and I love it because they mix a lot of colors and wear accessories (which is what a lot of girls do!) I absolutely adore Joe and if you are looking for great fashion/style ideas, I would check out pictures of Joe and his two bros for inspiration! Good luck with everything and have fun! :-)<br>  <br>  Urbanoutfitters.com is a GREAT store! Skinny jeans are great, tees are awesome, fedoras, vests, converse sneakers, scarfs!... it will make you feel more put together and "girly" as you say.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <a href="http://i36.tinypic.com/14p2tk.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i36.tinypic.com/14p2tk.jpg</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i35.tinypic.com/167t744.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i35.tinypic.com/167t744.jpg</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i35.tinypic.com/a9l3f4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i35.tinypic.com/a9l3f4.jpg</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ... pretty much anything those bros wear is suitable for what you want!|`|rPB6VqfOaa	Be yourself! You shouldnt be afraid to express your self, which i am guessing you are not. A boy can pull it off and still not get the "omg hes gay" look from everyone. Just do it. Do you believe in reincarnation? Maybe you were a girl in your before life. Haha just a guess there. Trying to be funny. Well anyway, the point is just be yourself and if youre the girly type then so be it. If its fine for girls to wear boxers and baggy sweatpants i dont see why boys shouldnt be allowed to wear make up and tight jeans?!|`|QevBVANtaa	I've heard of boys who were born but they feel like they were meant to be a girl. And vise versa and I believe it. How old are you? Seeing a therapist really wouldn't help I think, because they'd probably just tell u that ur wrong and all that nonsense. but talking to your parents (if u still live with them?) would help.<br>  K now what to wear!! I would say tight jeans, but since u have a thingy.. Maybe some looser ones. unless you can hide your junk, then go for the tight ones. (some girls wear baggy/loose jeans)<br>  As for tops, I wear tank tops all the time. I layer my shirts. A tank top and t shirt, anything. And some girls are flat chested. So I think you can pull this off!!<br>  =]<br>  Good luck

dFHsAXDMaa	welcome to my world.... been battling this for 39 yrs lol.... the only things I found that work is not shampooing hair more than once a week.....you can wet it to tame it in the monring and condition it just only shampoo once a week .... having curly and coarse hair by washing it every day you strip the natural oils out dry out hair as far as product  to use loreal pumping curls and cashmere curls work the best. I will tell you the more you flat iron it the more your ends will die and that makes hair look and appears super frizzy when down too. have your ends trimmed about once a month will make hair look and feel much healthier good luck straighten mine  once a week usually too|`|bksZg2BBaa	use some leave in conditioner and some curl style then dry with a diffuser|`|EB0ZXEStaa	i have the sameee kind of hair as you. <br>  <br>  okay so what i do is right when i get out of the shower i use herbal essances totally twisted gel or something like that. i have to put a lot in because of how thick my hair is, but it doesnt look crunchy. you should try it =]|`|U7lVXqrlaa	u can use garnier frutcose conditioner silk and shine and when u get out of the shower, brush ur hair and blow dry it and u could even put gel on then blow dry it|`|eOISRiiQaa	I know exactly how you feel. I have curly hair and its so crazy to manage it sometimes. Most of the time my hair is tamed but other days like today it just went crazy poofy. What i do that involves no crunch look or feel is that when I take a shower I use Dove Daily Moisture Therepy Conditioner. It's so good and it keeps your hair so healthy! I put this Conditioner before I clean my body and then I take it off before I get out. Then I wrap up my hair in a towel and do a quick dry of my hair. Then I brush my hair and then make sure its pretty much wet from all sides still and then I put Dove Conditioner on again. Trust me this wont make your hair oily. I thought it would but it actually just made it feel a little more softer but not oily at all. Then after I put that, I put two creams you can get at a Walgreens. First, the Sunsilk Anti-Frizz cream then the Brilliant Brunette Shine cream. (brown tube) This is what works for me. I dont know about you because everyone that has curly hair still has different types of curly hair but if you're like me (which sounds like you are) then I think this'll work for you.<br>  Hope this helped!!

nqkXE1cUaa	How to Get Rid of Oily Skin<br>  Step1<br>  Utilize a gel cleanser rather than soap or a creamy one. A creamy face wash will leave a residue in the skin and making it appear even oilier and soap is too drying and will cause flaking. Wash you face twice a day only and no more. Too much washing will dry out your skin causing it to produce even more oil<br>  Step2<br>  Exercise a toner carefully in your daily regime and use one that does not contain alcohol. You want to control the oil and not dry out your skin of it. Use clay based facial mask once it twice a week. It will cleanse your pores which often become clogged by dirt and debris.<br>  Step3<br>  Protect you skin from the sun and use a sun screen. Just because your skin has an oil base, it still needs protection from the UV rays. For your skin type, obtain one that is a gel and not a cream.<br>  Step4<br>  Blot away any shine that appears during the course of the day. Invest in special blotting paper to absorb the sheen and will not ruin makeup for women. If you notice any changes in your skin such as becoming oilier, flaky or breaking out, see a dermatologist to rule out any major skin conditions.|`|0l88fiUTaa	diet affects everything.....so eat healthy food(eliminate junk/fast food and processed foods) and drink a lot of water.<br>  - also cut down on sugar and maybe dairy<br>  - for a lot of people apple cider vinegar diluted with water and used either as a cleanser or toner helps maintain oil production and keeps skin balanced<br>  -lime/lemon tightens pores and can eliminate oil(but it might irritate your skin and they make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure)<br>  - aloe vera is good for oily skin because it keeps it looking matte<br>  -you can also try a yogurt/kefir face mask(this helps balance your skin's ph).<br>  - egg white mask<br>  -and don't over wash your face (2x a day max.)|`|LPxKxA6Taa	WASH YOUR FACE WITH SUGAR :) ive said this about 15 times to many of people out there asking questions about oily skin and etc. i know it sounds out the world and wierd to use a cooking ingredient on your face. but the more natural it is, the more better. so sugar is the way to go!<br>  <br>  basicaly just wet your face and take sugar and rub it all around your face. it sorta hurts. just depends on how hard your rub it on your face. but your results are amazin. it leaves your skin extra fresh and clean and when you touch it. it feels like baby skin. trust me|`|gpeOH11Daa	i do also. i found artistry products, work well and dont leave excess residue on my skin. you can try this site.

HT6txj9jaa	Okay I know when people are this age they tend to be a bit critical of themselves. Like you pay more attention to your flaws than your highlights about yourself. So here are some tips to make you feel pretty :D<br>  <br>  Put extra effort on your hair- Do a deep conditioning once a week (eliminates frizz) and try to dry your hair with a t-shirt rather than a towel (eliminates breakage). Also cut back on brushing your hair constantly since that causes breakage as well. Annd make sure you eat plenty of vitamins along with running your hair through cold water (makes your hair shiny :D). Once your hair is completely healthy you can try straightening, curling, or doing something fancy to it that makes it different from normal, that way when you go to school everyone will notice and totally love it!<br>  <br>  Makeup- I really hate it when people overload on the makeup too so I see where your coming from. So I totally agree with the whole natural makeup thing. Okay so since you have olive-ish typed eyes I think you should stick to light light tan (almost white), regular tan, and a deep brown for eye shadow. And stick to a shade of lip gloss that is about 1 to 2 shades darker than your normal lip color. Andd for blush and foundation go minimal on that light shade for blush and barely any foundation (just enough to cover blemishes). Last but not least Mascara!!!! That's my favorite touch just put it on the top eye lashes lightly though skip the bottom, you don't want to look like a racoon, which means skip the eyeliner.<br>  <br>  Clothes- For clothes just stick to your true style without going overboard. I love stores like urban outfitters and american eagle. And I tend to get the stuff that not everyone has. However I avoid things that look completely for lack of a better word-weird. So yeah just go for the look you want!<br>  <br>  Exercise, portion control, boring health stuff- Since you are concern with your weight you can always try exercise. I enjoy doing dance since its a hobby of mine where I can meet all my friends and work out. Or you can do more simple things like taking a jog after dinner or walking around the neighborhood on weekends.  Next portion control make sure you are always eating the right proportions, if you eat to much of something it may cause weight gain. Also check your food labels, I know this seems really annoying but just checking the calories can do wonders for your body. Finally if you are an emotional eater or eat when you bored then you try to do more things that would get your mind off of food, like going to the mall or seeing a movie. But remember your body is still growing so don't get completely obsessive over it. <br>  <br>  Well that's really just the basics, hope i helped :D|`|6EPedq48aa	shave ur arms!|`|RoRrOK9Laa	well your hairy arms you can bleach the hair but that miGHT make your arms a lighter color or shave them is you really want to. <br>  do you like your hair if not then i think you should let it grow longer becuz guys like that better but make it look nice and straighten it maybe. <br>  And stay in shape crunches are good for stomach.<br>  Wax your eye brows, there are ways to make your type of eye brows look good if you go to a Professional salon. <br>  And find a good lip balm r gloss (not too glossy) that's a light pink color but is noticeable, guys don't really like too glossy gloss ive heard, so just do subtle but noticeable pinkish color. <br>  Mascara always makes your eyes look prettier. <br>  Brush you teeth yellow definitely a turn off and fresh breath is nice<br>  I think you should use a foundation that's a nice color <br>  idk wat to say since i don't know what you look like but good luck<br>  and when you are older i think you are one of those girls that will become pretty when you older. and everyone is beautiful on some level, you just hav to find it and bring it out to let the world see it!!

You sound like your just really insecure. When I was in middle school people made fun of kids for ANYTHING. Then once they get in your head you start to criticize yourself worse then they do. Your not the ugly girl but if putting on a little makeup makes you feel better about yourself go ahead.

I'm not gonna read all that crap about how you're suicidal.|`|GaOcJOgzaa	Hey so I feel the same way. Although believe me you are not fat at all! I'm 95 pounds and have stomach fat too, but people recognize you are skinny so let's not get into that. Also, play up your hour glass shape by wearing shirts with bows or belts around the waist; this will accent you well. Also, you can get your eyebrows waxed, it will make a huge difference. Wear a light colored foundation (powder) and then a little blush. Maybe some mascara to brighten your eyes. If you want, wear a clear lip gloss too. <br>  <br>  Just be confident and hold your head high :)|`|LdlNMvsbaa	Why do you care what other people think? God put you on the earth the way you are, so it's you mission to be a good person the way you are. I'm not going to say that outer beauty is no big deal (it really isn't, but I know how hard it can be when you are a teenager-- which I am.) But first I want to tell you that you aren't fat or ugly! 90 pounds at 13!!! you are soooo lucky-- that isn't fat at all! I would love to be 90 pounds. And you have conngenital ptosis, so what? I know more than one person who has that and no one really cares! One person is one of the most popular people in her school and she is gorgous!!! Everyone has flaws, so don't fuss over your's. I can't believe that people would even tease you as if they are perfect. Obviously they aren't for being so ignorant! And just so you know, I have a HUGE nose! You are sooo lucky that you have a perfect one. I mean, I hate my nose! I wish I had your's! <br>  <br>  Unless you get tons of plastic surgery, no one can actually "get prettier." But what they can do is wear make-up to enhance the looks they have so they can LOOK prettier. Have you ever seen celebraties without makeup? EWW!! It's the makeup that makes them look gourgous. And don't worry, you don't have to cake it on and be a hypocrite like you said. What you should do is go to a make-up artist. Someone who will do it for free. (Like at the make-up counters in Macy's or something.) They are pros!! They can show you how to do your make-up so it looks like you aren't wearing any. And they can make you look soo nice! So, that's what I suggest.<br>  <br>  But really, don't worry about your looks. I would love to be 90lbs with a perfect nose, and I'm sure there are MILLIONS (no joke) that would want to be you right now. So have some self confidence. Celebs have tons, and that's why people look at them and say "wow, look at her!" you are not ugly...don't worry!<br>  <br>  For more of my advice, please check out my brand new advice website- it's soo cool!<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/advicebuzz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/advicebuzz/</a>|`|bOtk6QfIaa	Stop listening to these stupid @$$ because only you can make yourself feel beautiful. and if you have a little 2 much belly fat do a couple crunches but i mean 90 is nothin for a thirteen year old girl. If if ur eye brows are ugly pluck them. In my opinion u sound beautiful. If we were all the same no one would feel beautiful. Confidence is the best makeover of all. Walk into a room (not snody but) with confidence. Guys love that or girls I dont judge.<br>  <br>  God bless u|`|s7us9819aa	You have a really low self-confidence, and no one is going to think you are pretty unless you are confident with yourself.  Besides why would you want to be like everyone else?  Different is so much better. <br>  <br>  You are 13 and 5' 3", 90 pounds... The average weight for your age and height is 112-120 ..remember you are growing so if you feel like you are too "fat" you need that weight for growth spurts.  90lbs is borderline annorexic..so you are no where near fat and the fact that you keep thinking that you are is a problem. <br>  <br>  Start loving yourself.  You have to stop thinking you are fat and ugly.<br>  <br>  Maybe you don't fit the ideal figure of the girls we see on tv  or in music videos or in movies, but that does not mean anything.  You dont want to be fake and they are probably the fakest you will ever see. <br>  <br>  Please just stop hating yourself, be true to yourself, coverup, mascara and blush is all i wear for makeup. <br>  Goodluck|`|uQkLo6ZTaa	i am 11 and weigh 123.6, same height, but am not fat<br>  UR NOT FAT!!!!!!!!!<br>  u sound EXACTLY WHAT I LOOK LIKE<br>  scary<br>  i don't think u sound ugly<br>  maybe u should grow ur hair out<br>  then get cute bangs<br>  then use a cover up 4 the thing u said u have<br>  then u should look up how to deal with difficult ppl in google<br>  i havent done it, but i might<br>  cuz there is this 1 guy in my class who is a fuh king idiot<br>  and he is mean<br>  and really hurts my feeling cuz he makes fun of my zits<br>  and is mean<br>  and is shaped like a rectangle|`|KjKlytKqaa	im not gay or anything, but i think you should grow your hair out, when it is sholder length try front bangs or something, i think it is just your hair.|`|637689f0ee01c942341ef4e2656ed15aaa	why do you want to change yourself in the first place ?????|`|TbszMF6Naa	Um have a sex change maybe youll be happier as a dude.|`|BL2DqmNkaa	Your hair is brown, so avoid heavy black eye makeup. Not only will you look like a raccoon, but it will be way more noticeable that you're wearing makeup if you wear it too heavy. Stick to neutral colors like browns or greens, and highlight with peachy tones.

Keep in mind, you're only 13: any body issues take time to grow into. I have an oval face too, and I've found that wavy hair helps minimize the roundness.

If your hair is resistant use a stronger perm, or leave it in 5mins longer. If you have color in your hair please use a perm for color treated hair. Don't shampoo your hair for 1 day afyer the perm.

TH6LfPE5aa	Well first and foremost...STOP straightening!!! If you must, start using a flat iron heat protectant serum or spray to protect the rest of your hair from damage.

Start getting regular trims. Hope this helps ; )|`|anMuljVgaa	You need to use a good leave in conditioner to help with the breakage and split ends caused by the flat iron.

Alot of artists like to put their own touch into their tattoos and i think thats what this one has done.

I wouldn't worry too much about it.  If you haven't even had it for a week...trust me...it will be fine.  The ink is usually darker as soon as you get it done, but by the time it's healed, it fades a little bit.  Give it some time.  :)  You'll love it.|`|c506JMjMaa	You could go back to the tattooist when its healed and tell him you're not happy with the design and that you want more colour added.<br>  He/she may offer you a touch up free of charge.

Try to keep your hair back and away from your ear.  Don't mess with it alot and always wash your hands before touching/cleaning ect If the infection dosen't go away or keeps coming back take it out.  See a doctor if it doesnt start too look better in a couple days.  Signs of a sever infection include fever swelling redness hot to touch and tenderness.  Also check and see what the ring, stud or whater is made out of.  If your alergic to the metal it could be making the site red and sore.  |`|yKPv1IfAaa	I don't know what a rook is either...<br>  <br>  But with piercings in general, some people are just more prone to infection.

Continue cleaning it probably twice a day with anti-bacterial soap and don't touch it too much. For the pain, try a Tylenol and avoid sleeping on that ear. I would let it ride out, it should heal if you take care of it well. DON'T take the piercing out. Don't let it close back up, this can trap the infection under the skin, obviously not good. |`|mYY9uOQKaa	my ears do the same thing. in fact, i got it pierced in the cartilidge about 5 months ago and i changed it last night and it hurt so much that i fainted twice, so i know what you are going through.<br>  my suggestion would be to not change the earring at all. you have very sensitive ears and they are not yet healed. just keep the studs in there and leave them, dont worry about changing them for at least a few more months.|`|YrSageYwaa	Oh wow, lol<br>  sounds like youve had some bad luck with ear piercings! lol <br>  Well..the best thing to do is to put bactine on it!

Also they pierce your ear with the jewelry which is not sharp enough to make a clean hole.  Grab a piece of paper and jab a pencil through it.  See the torn bits on the other side?  That what gets shoved into your ear making healing time longer.  Sure guns are convenient (you can find someone with one at any mall) but its not worth it.<br>  Go to a professional piercer who uses brand new sterile needles.  These needles are hollow so that they pierce a clean hole which heals faster and better.  And its cleaner b/c your ear is the the only ear that needle has ever touched.|`|7ZLS2AbNaa	go to clairs, icings, or even your docter, it only hurts for 13 seconds!|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	None, go to a professional studio and get it done properly with a needle by a PROFESSIONAL.<br>  Gun are unsanitary and very rough on the ear as well.<br>  Needles can be autoclaved (a tool they used to sterelize surgical tools in hospitals) so they're practically germ free until the air hits them.<br>  Just go the needle way.. and if it's done by a professional who knows what he/she is doing, it'll be quick and somewhat painless|`|fbe7b44959586a403cc7307cf6ba7b2aaa	well its always safer to do it at a professional place like Claires but I have done both (professional and sewing needle) and my ears have come out just fine.

That could be a hard one. <br>  First off I don't suggest a gun. Gun is, one, not very sanitary, two, it just goes straight through pushing the skin apart which is why it tends to get bumps around the hole. <br>  Second, sewing needles are not sanitary either, they are not very sharp, and piercing with one has a much higher risk of infection. Plus that would mean you would have to do it yourself and that may sound easier than it truly is. Shoving a needle through your own flesh? That takes guts.|`|EeXhfptbaa	i would go to a professional piercing shop cuz their more clean and people can be allergic to stuff at claires. the piercing shop is always safer might take longer to heal but over all it'll be better. i got my ears pierced at claires and had an allergic reaction, i went to my boyfriend and he did em at the shop and no problems i think going to a shop with a needle is better overall|`|eZDuCIxaaa	Defiantly get the gun, I got double piercings years ago at Claires with the gun and it was so quick and didn't hurt at all!

Or you could try to make it work like jell it out or make it look like  a layer or just screw what people think and laugh it off.
azswXRDBaa	Well the piercer should have a standard gauged bar for tongue piercings, I'd say its probably 16 or 18g. My mom likes titanium tongue jewelry but I guess it just depends on what you like. <br>  As for the ears, go with something with out nickle, this seems to irritate lots of people's ears. I don't think that lobe piercings normally have a gauge, though you can get them gauged. |`|EeXhfptbaa	16 g for tongue and just no it's not important just don't buy cheap tongue rings newhere like from claires just buy them from a piercing shop their better for you and their real their not cheap.

You will probably never use half of the stuff that you're required to learn and after you take the test on it, it'll probably get filed way in the back of your mind and never touch again. (What's new though right?) Basically high school is about the experience. I'm not going to tell you not to drink and do drugs 'cause more than likely the ones that tell you its not going to get you anywhere in life are completely right but like I said, some things are apart of the experience. Do as much as you can in this short time. Go to the movies, concerts, football games, field trips, all the fun stuff that you'll say you don't have the money for when your older. Find a boy to fall head over heals in love with (Even if it is just a high school love that'll be over next semester.) I'm not saying blow off the actual education part, do your homework, get good grades, ya know. But don't let that be your high school experience. FYI, you don't need twenty people to have a party and you don't need a limo to go to homecoming... Its just not all that... One of the best experiences I've had is rolling into freshman homecoming in my mom's jeep with my two best friends, the sun roof and windows down and Kanye West- Strong blaring with crappy bass. (Keep in mind this was last year with that song was the stuff.) Everybody stared at us as we got out, probably got about as much attention as anybody with a limo or a pile of people. Just stay true to yourself and don't second guess yourself. You want to do something? Do it, you may not be able to later... If it turns out bad, hey its another picture for the scrap book that you'll look back on and laugh your butt of about. Keep a smile on your face and pretend like you know where you're going. I promise things will be bad at some point, high school certainly isn't perfect but know that it is just high school, things always look up. Hope they're the best days of your life, I'm sure they will be.|`|adb7f1976c04b5afddae187e35b7540aaa	High school is better because you have different people in every class (and people from all different grades, in electives). I guess you get more homework than middle school but I was one of those lazy kids who put in the absolute minimum amount of work and still got As so I don't really know. I never ever used a backpack. I carried my books, and just used a regular handbag. You have a locker for a reason. I guess my biggest tip is don't try to be popular. If you are just yourself you will be well liked.|`|2Lv37jg1aa	I am not a freshman or in hs. All the girls in my town were hollister and abercrombie clothes. Anyways here is a cite were you can design outfits with real clothes from real stores <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=5415892" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=54158...</a><br>  ^ that is my design so you can look at that and comment if you like it. Once your down that you can click sign up and start making outfits of your own. Tell your friends !!!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah good luck and have fun and enjoy evrey min !|`|wZlqxCTNaa	Try not to worry too much. You'll find that it's not as different as you thought it would be. Don't take any bulls*** from the older students.<br>  <br>  A backpack is the best way to carry books and stuff, but an older friend (in school, not an old person) with a car to drive you and your stuff is even better.|`|voodzn3Naa	At my high school all the upperclassmen hate freshmen. sorry, just a warning. You don't get that much h/w at all unless you're in advanced classes or something but it depends on the teacher. You should use a tote like maybe this kind at Hollister :<a href="http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10251&catalogId=10201&productId=449640&langId=-1&categoryId=12747&parentCategoryId=12552&colorSequence=01" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...</a><br>  Hope I helped =]|`|jTPKvoO5aa	Enough to fit your books.<br>  Even though in high school it's cool to carry your books.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your outfit - DO NOT over due it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Straigten your hair & don't wear too much make up.<br>  You don't wanna seem fake. There's not as much homework as teachers say there is.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be friendly & you'll make lots of friends :)|`|KtqIIFSbaa	hah.<br>  itsz not that great.<br>  dont think your officially "cool" cuhz your a in highschool<br>  they get dogged on alot.<br>  but i mean.<br>  i met some kick *** freshmen when i was a junior lol.<br>  and to be honest.<br>  i only had one binder.<br>  no backpack, no nothing.<br>  and one more thing.<br>  its gunnna be the fastest time of your life.<br>  my 4 yearsz flew by like no freakin other.<br>  now im out in the real world.<br>  kinda sad =/<br>  enjoy highschool thou.<br>  its lots of fun if you meet the RIGHT ppl.<br>  enjoy.|`|Z4dSv7kBaa	I'm a freshman and so far hs has been really fun! its different from ms cuz there is A TON more freedom, but to be honest the hw is not significantly greater, its about the same. The friends you hang out with as a freshman are most likely gonna be your friends for the rest of hs...so choose wisely. don't just hang out with the popular crowd just cuz u wanna be in...it will bite you in the but eventually, its a mistake i made. choose REAL friends who have your best interest in mind, and they will be the ones you remember throughout your hs experience. and yes definitely use a tote, pink from Victoria's secret sells them  for like $20. you will have a ton of fun if you just be smart about things and be safe!!!!!!!!<br>  good luck with everything! don't worry, its not as intimidating as it is made out to be i promise!|`|HLmpsX9eaa	get a jansport backpack|`|I5HYWaXiaa	Normally it depends on what kind of teachers you have to see how much homework you have. <br>  But you are going to have quite a bit of homework.<br>  And in high school they are not gonna let you off the hook for not doing it.<br>  <br>  The high school is probably bigger.<br>  A LOT more students.<br>  And not to forget older guys.<br>  All girls love that.<br>  <br>  Next, try to look good all the time.<br>  You can wear sweats and stuff like that.<br>  But always try to have your hair and make-up done.<br>  <br>  I didn't carry a book bag in high school.<br>  I always just carried my books.<br>  But I had a Nike bag for track practice.<br>  <br>  High school comes with tons of drama.<br>  That's all it is.<br>  Drama, drama, drama, **** talkin' backstabbers, and some education.<br>  <br>  Nothing anybody can tell you will actually prepare you much.<br>  But the seniors will probably be mean to you guys because your "fresh meat."<br>  <br>  Hope high school treats you well girl!<br>  <br>  Oh yes, the most important thing is..<br>  Don't steal any older girls boyfriend..<br>  They will resort in fighting and you'll probably get your *** beat.|`|RbZJY8WRaa	HAHA im going to be a freshman too! so exciting huh? well from what i know from highschool friends is that:<br>  You have a block schedule. So its periods: 1, 3 , 5, 7 on one day and periods: 2, 4, 6 ,8 another day. so basically they are called even and odd days. anyways if you had an even class and got a ton of homework it wouldnt be due til wednesday because you have the odd classes on tuesday. following me here?<br>  <br>  its just a bigger school basically and dont feel intimidated.<br>  try making introducing yourself to a lot of people on the first day<br>  <br>  backpacks and totes are good. most people (girls i c) carry totes or purses to have their notebooks in and they carry a binder. at least thats what i do in 8th grade.<br>  <br>  i cant wait til next year either!|`|R6Z8onywaa	i use a tote its leather and gorgeous but may be expensive for u.. lol (its from bloomingdales)<br>  its not that different, more people.... <br>  not much hw but do it....<br>  umm have friends<br>  wear cool clothes dont b an abercrombie zombie<br>  urban outfitters rock! umm be friendly dont be all cliquey<br>  dont be fake, and pile on the make-up<br>  <br>  im a freshman|`|eBxgZ0JOaa	Congrats....now you're the lowest of the low, Here are just a few helpful words of advice:<br>  <br>  -dont straighten your hair and wear 4 pounds of eyeliner the first day and think your hot s h i t, because you will look like every other freshman and embarrass your self.<br>  <br>  - Dont think you're smart because you filled up water bottles with vodka/ or coke bottles with bacardi and snuck it onto your 8th grade field trip. We've all done it.. so don't be proud.<br>  <br>  - Don't post things like "FINALLY A FRESHIE!! LOL" on myspace. If anything, you suck big time.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Dont tell everyone you love your boyfriend after 2 days, you're an idiot.<br>  <br>  - You'll never be as hot as the '10, '11 & '12girls. So don't try.<br>  <br>  -Don' t try to pull that "Well you were freshmen once..." STOP! We know that we were freshmen, but we aren't anymore so shut up.<br>  <br>  - Don't be a ****. This should be the number one rule.!!<br>  <br>  -upperclassmen dont like you..so dont try and get with them. no one cares about you <br>  <br>  Welcome to hell. :]<br>  <br>  Believe me---You CANT win. Have FUN being a freshman...for a fun-filled year with NO life and NO opinion whatsoever.|`|ExL22JZWaa	ahh yes highschool, I miss those days. Honestly, you may lose your friends to cliques, boys, and fights. It happens sometimes, it may not happen freshman year but it could happen. Try and stay away from as much drama as possible- dont steal anyones boyfriend, etc. Try and keep who you are, dont change to fit in- its not worth it. Try and join sports teams, if you're not a sports fan join clubs/organizations, try and be as active in your highschool career as possible. be nice to your family- they have your best interest at heart. dont to drugs and drink alcohol- it really changes who you are:/ thats about it. have fun!!|`|gIhOY9LPaa	If you use a tote, buy one of those from hollister and abercrombie.  But, if you carry a backpack, something plain.  L.L. Bean or Jansport  will do|`|5N3odm3Qaa	If you don't mind parting with a few extra dollars, a North Face backpack will last you from now straight through college. I'm still using the backpack I got in 9th grade (I'm 24). They are much tougher than LL Bean bags. I've put my fair share of Bean backpacks through the ringer and they haven't come out victorious.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend a North Face bag like the Yavapai. It's very tough and cool.<br>  <br>  Homework greatly depends on your school. I went to a private school where I got more work on a daily basis than I did in some of my college classes.<br>  <br>  Regarding friends, just find your niche and don't do anything stupid. You'll probably encounter opportunities to drink and/or smoke pot. Just don't. That stuff leads nowhere you want to go.|`|zdPu4z88aa	I'm a sophomore right now... the class choices aren't great but it'll get better... I would memorize your schedule and make sure you know where you're going, or it will be stressful. Pick out an outfit you are confident in, so it won't bother you on your first day. Pay attention in your classes! I didn't and it's coming back to bite me in the butt. If you don't think you made a right choice with your optional classes you should change them in your first few weeks. And most importantly: find someone to sit with at lunch! <br>  <br>  my freshman year I carried a tote and it was kind of a pain. this year I have a backpack & it's not super cute, but it's more functional. I would look at your schedule & a school map and how long your passing periods are... if you have time to go to your locker a lot them you should be fine with a tote. or you can do a backpack & a purse to look more stylish =)
YAQtMkuIaa	Juan : con 31 a?os la solución no es quitarte la vida , si no darle vida a esos 31 que buscan una salida !!! Si no  tienes trabajo en tu profesión , no desesperes !!! No eres el único que su primer o segundo o tercer trabajo no tienen nada que ver con lo que se han preparado ; tampoco pretendas un sueldo rimbombante !!! Ocúpate en algo en lo que quizás no estés cómodo pero que te permita pasar ese momento salir del paso : haz trámites para personas que no les gusta hacerlos , ocupa tus manos en algo que te guste y sácale provecho , por ejemplo , crea figuras con alambre forrado en color , escribe con el mismo , nombres de personas y véndelos ; fabrica marcos para espejos con resina , pintados o barnizados quedan  preciosos , y allí puedes aplicar conocimientos de tu carrera . En fin , Juan te tiro ideas como para salir del paso hasta ubicarte en lo que eres . un muchacho lleno de ilusiones , que por una extra?a razón ha caído en un pozo depresivo del que le cuesta salir . Pero recuerda , que siempre que llovió , paró y que esta mala racha va a pasar !!!  Te deseo toda la suerte del mundo !!!|`|EHkz312Waa	Yo estoy igual hijo.

And ask for "No bump". <br>  It works really well. I was a year round competition swimmer for 10 years... So those bumps can be annoying and hurt.<br>  <br>  If you cant find that... I have actually been using "Clean & Clear: Deep Cleaning Astringent" with Salicylic Acid in it. I pour some on a cotton ball and apply it to those areas... (if you have just shaved, it may burn, but blow on it for a second and its fine.)... I also use it under my arms when I get some of those little pink bumps there.<br>  <br>  Essentially, the salicylic acid and alcohol dry out the bumps, and the skin is fine and returns to its normal color/texture. <br>  <br>  Think of the bumps as little quick pimples. and treat them with the same product, and you wont have a problem.<br>  <br>  I swim everyday. I dont have any problems.
61Z4RuSRaa	First exfoliate, use a good body scrub/polish. Moisturize with an ordinary moisturizer. Then go over body once with a light tanner avoiding knees and elbows and repeat once more when dry. If you use a light tan you won't end up looking like a tangerine.And wait about 15 minutes before putting clothes back on, better to be safe than streak up your tan. And natural less cakey make up always looks better with a tan :)

Get straight fringe - uneven bangs looks really odd on you. I'd suggest cutting your hair even shorter, or leaving it the length it is and curling it. Lay off the eyeliner - Mascara is and will always be more flattering than laying on the eyeliner. I like your mole, it's pretty, and even though your face is narrow, I'm sure you can use that to your advantage.<br>  <br>  Overall, you have nice things to start with - narrow face, lovely eyes, good nose and lip shape. If you fixed your uneven bangs and did something with your hair, and laid off the eyeliner and put some mascara on lightly instead, you'd be even more stunning.|`|N09LhhBAaa	NO u are gorgeous hun! i love yuor prety eyes :)|`|BmmkY73Qaa	you are absolutly adorable and have gorgeous eyes|`|zDeFibxzaa	no you arent ugly,although since you are asking i have to assume you have a self esteem issue.happiness will fix it all for you.i think you need to eat a little though,a few pounds would help.|`|wdFwirb4aa	You look fine, dear. <br>  <br>  Don't let people's opinions change your mind on how you feel you look.|`|eba7fefdf839622869be8b19d9b9ca2baa	<a href="http://www.the-n.com/ntv/shows/image/degrassi/deg_emma_season4_220x130.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-n.com/ntv/shows/image/deg...</a><br>  <br>  You look like Emma on Degrassi.<br>  Your a cutie-patootie. :D|`|tRAHbAL8aa	Kindaa.|`|yje6VNCpaa	you have gorgeous eyes, but i say lay off on the eyeliner(:|`|ohzLzFWaaa	no your cute.<br>  <br>  stunning eyes though..!

I know how to braid normally just not french braid|`|93NcTOnkaa	Pull your hair into 3 pieces about the same length, put one of the side pieces over the midle piece then the opposite side piece over the new middle piece, keep doing this untill you have about an inch or so of hair left at the end and then put it in a ponytail.<br>  <br>  French braids are the same except you have to add pieces of hair into the main 3 pieces as you go along.|`|LprHQtLBaa	it depends on how you want your hair to look like in the morning.  if i want my hair wavy, i braid it in two french braids after a shower. if not, i usually blow dry it and stick it in a loose pony tail - so it doesn't turn into a fro by morning!|`|8mBDFm4Xaa	If you know how to french braid that is what you do. just french braid all the hair that you want braided. while it is wet helps the best. then just sleep on it. hope i helped!|`|51rzwYLDaa	u can do it pretty much anyway u want:)|`|aYdmXafbaa	u just braid it and dats it|`|v2xUy1dXaa	idk bout what you are asking, but about french braiding look it up on youtube. and it takes practice for french braids, to make them tight enough.|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	If you want bigger waves, which looks best most of the time, I just put it into two braided pigtails. <br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Yupp that's just what I do, and it works really well. <br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  Good  luck girly!
zFb022Iiaa	I don't know the answers to all of that.  But the very best top coat is seche vite.  It dries really fast so you are less likely to make a mess.  It is on the thick side so it protects your paint job longer.  Worth the couple extra bucks.  Also the green sticky basecoat made by anyone is cheap and starts you out right.  If you have a sally they are the cheapest there.|`|QsxIPCCZaa	<a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/how-should-i-take-care-of-my-fingernails.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/how-should-i-tak...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lifespy.com/2008/how-to-take-care-of-your-fingernails/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifespy.com/2008/how-to-take-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/233506/tips_to_help_grow_and_care_for_fingernails.html?cat=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  these websites answer all of your questions and more plus it is very infomative good luck I hope you get amazing nails :) have a blessed day|`|n2YQCZ3faa	personally i think that look awfully trashy.

vsWUHwAyaa	sorry hum, but i think it will wash out your complexion.<br>  HOWEVER, that is not a reason to try it. You will never know for sure unless you try.

I found out that my hair is natural auburn red.  I found this out because I went and had my hair dyed auburn red and no one noticed.  My husband said I wasted $65.00.  But I think your hair will look good in the color you picked.  It don't last long though.|`|nsYRh67daa	IN MY OPINION the color of your hair is not going to help at all|`|sPDQIxJTaa	i like your hair the way it is now!<br>  you're really pretty by the way. : )|`|y8ThiIh0aa	i think it will wash out ur complexion just a bit. if u gow red dont do it candy apple red do it natraully!|`|aVgaBK15aa	it says all the pictures are marked as private<br>  :S<br>  xo|`|TZhwQfSgaa	I don't think it would make a big difference with that colour. <br>  I agree with your stylist..|`|eHfEh85zaa	eh i like it as it is now lol a good black and brown mixture is nice but if u really want red make it look more natural best answer|`|pjgQAXM7aa	Make sure that the red is more like a natural red, not like apple red. Natural is IN, so make sure that every kind of make up that you do use and the color of your hair is natural; Therefore making you prettier :). In my opinion, the crazy colored hairs don't make the person look absolutely beautiful, they just make the girl look fake but.. Still pretty haha.
O0uyr5Gwaa	I'd get a curly haircut... if you straighten it a lot you can badly damage it, but I've seen a lot of curly-headed people with a piece of front part of their hair straightened and it looks really nice.|`|v2xUy1dXaa	lol curly hair is the best :):):)  get a curly cut  and then if you want sometimes you can straighten it... I'm sure it wont look bad having a curly cut go straight.
O0uyr5Gwaa	If you can't stop heat styling it everyday and dying it every few months, you should definitely not wash it everyday. Conditioning is fine since your hair is probably dried out from the heat styling, but washing it everyday isn't good. Washing it every other day is what I do, because I too heat style mine frequently.|`|E1Lzi9KBaa	First, The heat EVERY DAY will damage your hair<br>  Second, only use conditioner every other day or your hair will get greasy! <br>  Third, stop dyeing it so much!

Just change it up a bit and try new things :) Honestly, you aren't ugly at all.|`|AA12069201	i think you'll look better once you get your braces off :)|`|Rg2tqEPkaa	1) don't listen to them i think your cute tell 'em to shut the *@#$ up<br>  <br>  2) make up provides a comfort zone and adds confidence|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Ur ok.

You don't need guys to hang with you for you to feel that your pretty. Maybe you haven't just met the guy who truly know what beauty really is. Well the guys you said where just not good enough or nice enough for you to be with. Don't bother yourself so much, beauty isn't only found outside but on the inside also. Try to feel free & comfortable, in that case, they'll get to see the light side of you and eventually they'll figure out that your really are beautiful, not just on the inside but also the outer part of you. Go girl. don't let that mess you up, for as long as you feel pretty, then you are.|`|bhnPUzypaa	well of course you have braces, so i'm sure they will be coming out one day giving you a gorgeous smile! You are pretty, guys are just shallow at you're age and all they want in a relationship is good looks but tbh you can be absolutely gorgeous and have a **** personality. So don't try hard, maybe style your hair, get some cute outfits, but don't over do it. You'll grow into natural beauty! And by the way you are not ugly. Stop being so insecure! the time will come!|`|g5N7CEqcaa	Hun your cute. Seriously I'm 19 and no guys ever looked at me in high school and then when I got outta high school guys started to look at me.

But if you feel like changing cut your hair, change your style try something new just make sure your happy with it.|`|VdpsvTVXaa	first of all , forget what they say you're not ugly :D<br>  anyway - a qood haircut qoes a LONG way so i think<br>  you need a trendy new haircut that qoes with your face .<br>  (ask a hairdresser at the salon] .<br>  also , try wearinq a little makeup , NOT ALOT .<br>  start off with some eyeshadow , mascara, eyeliner and just<br>  experiment .<br>  <br>  then try accessorizinq more .<br>  wear cure barettes,bracelets, bags, all that .<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped :DD<br>  <br>  best answer ?|`|waA0uBXdaa	1, once you get your braces off everything will be better.<br>  um, i think also you should get a different layer job (hair).<br>  your bangs are awkward. I think that if you grew them out, or got rid of them, or did something different with them then maybe that will help.<br>  also, try mascara? i can't really tell if you're wearing makeup or not but mascara really makes eyes pop out!|`|hni3WIeCaa	once the braces come off you're good to go.|`|dtsrnxPIaa	ummmmm.... well you are already pretty so IDK|`|BmmkY73Qaa	i think your very pretty|`|mo8OfKjeaa	dye your hair light.<br>  <br>  please get rid of your braces.<br>  <br>  dont wear a lot of makeup, but if you, then wear bright colours. and apply blush to your cheeks.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|twX2QeUIaa	You look fine to me.

UotHmPaFaa	try blistex|`|YTQph9lSaa	What you really need is a good lip BALM! One with healthy, healing, and moisturizing ingredients. I have the watermelon and strawberry flavor of LA Lips from LA Minerals. It really moisturizes your lips, leaves them a little shiny, definitely NOT sticky. And the best part is your lips stay moist for hours. I think they were on sale for $3.95 when I bought mine. <br>  Oh..they have this neato kit now too that you can dip the lip balm in minerals for some extra shine and color too! I bought that a few days ago.

0SsJR87xaa	Hey whats up man I live in NY too. I'm pretty sure with parental permission you only have to be like 13 to get piercings. Without parental permission you have to be 16 at a tattoo/piercing shop or 18 at one of those stands you find in the mall. <br>  <br>  As for price I'd say about 40-50 bucks for a lip piercing. Matters where you go of course but 40-50 is the average I see.<br>  <br>  Just keep a couple things in mind.. Go to a legit place. There's good piercers and there's bad piercers. Not only can a good piercer lower your risk of infection with proper technique but they can also make it less painful. Make sure they use fresh sterile needles/jewelry and wear gloves. If you don't feel comfortable with their procedure don't be scared to walk your a** right out of there.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I'm sure it will look cool!|`|zYVCJRMXaa	With mom your fine. Most wont pierce those with parental consent under 13. Though some do not pierce anyone under age 18 it depends on the shop but you should be fine.<br>  <br>  IN NY means you dont live in NYC so idk.|`|6npsRIzUaa	If you're going with your mom, which I'd imagine means you have her parental consent, you can get it done at any age, really. It just depends on how young the piercer will pierce, and usually they only won't pierce under 13, you should be good. Prices vary from shop to shop, I wouldn't go more than $60 on a single lip piercing, but look for cleanliness and friendliness before looking for a good price.|`|PQXiXEZKaa	you have to be at least 14 with parental consent to get a facial piercings. <br>  <br>  price should range from 30-50$ <br>  <br>  plus a 5-10 $ tip is nice :)|`|9O5eebwXaa	With parental consent, you probably have to be 16. I've seen lip piercings run for about $55.

LiRwZjqlaa	For eyeshadow, find a color palette that looks good with your skin tone or that is made specially for your skin tone. <br>  <br>  For lips, use a nude lipstick or no lipstick. I usually just use gloss.<br>  <br>  For blush, pick a pale pink color - not too bright.<br>  <br>  For mascara, I would recommend Neutrogena lash tint, because it doesn't add too much volume for a natural basic look. <br>  <br>  If you want to use any eyeliner choose a muted brown color. <br>  <br>  hope this helped :)|`|ff61fc468bd6d03395d15e35b8c08f90aa	just use a little concealer where its necessary and put use a powder to get rid of shine and make your skin a little more even. you can put a nice shimmer on your cheeks or use a cute blush. put a little brown eyeliner in the corner of your lower lids and curl your lashes. i have dark lashes so i just use a clear mascara if i feel like it. put on a cute lip gloss and your good to go. that's exactly what i do in the morning haha. you can also touch up your eye brows if necessary.

Cute girls make other girls feel ugly, they make them feel like inferior people. The other girls feel like the cute girl has it easier than they do, like she could get the hot guy, or clothes look better on her, etc. When people make fun of her, they are tearing her down in order to feel greater than her. They also do it do gain popularity amongst their peers. Girls by nature are very judgemental and mean. Girls are very jealous, and by making the cute girl feel like crap, they feel like they can have what she has.

Well that can cause other less cute girls to think that the cute ones are B*tch*s.<br>  <br>  HeHe those are my best answers|`|MAABlA3jaa	They probably hate people because they are so insecure about themselves.

YdI1SSyKaa	Try Cetaphil products !! I use the Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar, its amazing and dosent dry out your face. Acne is caused my bacteria and irritation so this just might solve your problems, goodluck !<br>  <br>  p.s. if you dont like the Cetaphil moisturizer, try Olay Complete for Sensitive Skin =)|`|XmvVy5TVaa	I have recently started using a line called Wild Sage Botanicals.  I use the Almond Cleanser, Lavender Mint Toner, Wild Cherry Rejuventer Syrum and Geranium Rose Face Ltion.  All the ingredients are natural, hand made and hand picked from Gerima's (the owner) herb garden in Colorado.  They cleanse thoroughly as well as moisturize throroughly, and I have combinatin skin that gets more dry in the winter.<br>  She also makes two masks: honey papaya, which I found to be a little drying, as well as an Almond one.  They are both all natural and help to unclog pores.  She also makes a Calandula steam that helps to unclog pores as well.  I am going to try that next.<br>  Check out her website.  She has an natural acne stick, that you can use as a spot treatment.  She gets good reviews.<br>  I would also suggest a natural toner.  I use, as well as Wild Sage, Thayers Rose Water Witch Hazel Toner.  Again, this is all natural, and one of the best toners I have used in my entire life.  You can use just this to clean your skin, too.  It makes my skin very soft and supple, and it glows.<br>  I used to use Clinique, but after reading a lot about chemicals and irritants in skin care lines, decided to try something without them.  <br>  But I am not completely natural, as I still use a peel once a week and a scrub (7-Day Scrub from Clinique). <br>  You may want to look into exfoliating, as your pores may be clogged, too.  I started using the Super Moisture from Clinique because of the SPF, but I noticed my pores were clogged, so I had to stop using it.|`|4S8Ecjj6aa	A lot of this just depends on the individual. I've never been able to use. Jergens soap, and clear, perfume-free soaps like Neutragena work for me. Noxema is also good. I like the Almay products, including the milk cleanser.<br>  <br>  If you have sensitive skin be careful which sunscreen you use.

fTrnMm8naa	I once got a huge spot of superglue on my favorite pair of jeans. I couldn't bear to part with them so I just put them in the laundry even time I washed a load.  Eventually the glue wore off. I think this is because the glue would crack/flake off the material once the denim was wet and being rubbed against other articles of clothing. Time and lots of washing was how I got it off then. Now when I get sticky things on my clothes I use a  product called  "Goo Gone." it is great for removing adhesive products. This might be just what you need, if you can find some<br>  <br>  I have heard, but not yet needed to test, that lighter fluid will remove it. You simply pour a little on, rub it, and then wash it immediately. Use caution because it is, obviously, flammable.<br>  <br>  .|`|XwzN0pIEaa	I don't think you can...Sorry.

That's worse than a hair piece!  I didn't even know that stuff was still out on the market.  Probably b/c I haven't seen an infomercial for it for about 10 years.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the best thing to do is to get some clippers, shaving gel, and a razor and make the rest of his head match that bald spot.

j2yhjBDiaa	Don't do it!  At best it will come out orange.  To do that drastic of a change, you should really go to a professional.|`|luVK5cHqaa	It probably won't work the color you want it to be. Especially if it's jet black, you'll have to strip it before you can dye it a light color.<br>  <br>  If your hair is already in bad condition as is, stripping it is almost not an option. It would destroy your hair.|`|5fhDZkhSaa	Since your hair is dyed black you will not be able to bleach it blonde, regardless of the type you use. Some parts of your hair may end up a lighter black but that is about it. If you hair is in bad shape already and you continue to try to bleach it, your hair will fall out (not all of it, it is usually in clumps and the rest is fried). Your best bet is to cut off as much as you can do get rid of the dead split ends and grow the black out before trying to go blonde.|`|E5PwsWj8aa	Dyed black hair is tricky to get rid of, I've had my hair dyed black a good bit and I always change my mind and want it blonde shortly after it's been black. The Born Blonde isn't going to blonde out your black in one go, it'll probably turn it orange, if your natural roots are showing at all, those will bleach out pretty fast and be really light blonde, but the rest will be orangey. I recommend "Color Oops" if the black hasn't been there for very long, or L'oreal Super Blonde or Color Zap. As far as I know all of those leave hair in a condition to be immediately recolored, but with any bleaching product, you're going to want incredible conditioner.|`|ac8196d955fedb57884e6a762988d352aa	dont even got there. going from dark to light is something to be left to the hairdressers. IF you try it. youll either find your hair to be bright orange and maybe even falling out because of its condition, or if there is no bleach in the product, nothing will happen at all and youll have wasted time and money. You need to strip the hair of its dark pigmentation first, which is highly unrecommended that you do yourself.<br>  <br>  dont go there. many women with dark hair have made the same mistake before you and many will continue to, dont fall into the category or youll be a ranga.<br>  <br>  save up your money and go to a hairdresser. believe me its worth it. then you can do your own regrowth if you learn how to do it properly but the initial conversion needs TLC.|`|172dLwiSaa	You will need to lift the darker color dye out before you can apply the lighter shade you should be able to pick up a stripping kit in the same section where you got your dye. However it will probably not be the color you intended and if your hair is in bad condition you may want to wait and grow it out or you might have better results going to a professional.

Over the counter remedies such as cleansers, creams, ointments, etc. These things have been proven over and over again not to work. Why? It does not address the root cause of the problem.<br>  <br>  2. Go see a doctor and or dermatologist. They will generally prescribe prescription drugs which include topicals and or antibiotics.

SVZZ0u0paa	In general perms are destructive to your hair. They dry it out and fine hair becomes frizzy and "un-natural" looking and feeling. Also be careful if you are also coloring your hair, this is additional processing. Today's youthful hairstyles tend to not be permed and less styling. If you still want to consider this go to a professional stylist. Another good option is get a great cut which adds volume and fullness, eliminating the need for a perm and easier to care for.|`|v2xUy1dXaa	here are some good pics i think of pretty curly perms. look pretty natural to me!|`|T1OqmFHsaa	are you black or something else?<br>  a black perm is straight<br>  i hate how you stupid white,mexican, filipino, etc. are so oblivious to other types of perms.<br>  its called ignorance<br>  and you guys are so certain there is only a curly perm.<br>  fuckin dumbasses|`|V0zaULApaa	I THINK ANYTHING WOULD LOOK NICE, IF ITS A PERM.  i WOUL LIKE YOU ANYWAYS...

The minor must have received an offensive tattoo and must be determined inappropriate by the artist for the purpose of covering it.  You can not get a new tattoo with parental consent, only a cover up of an offensive tattoo.  Subsections are as follows:<br>  <br>  (1) The existing tattoo must contain:<br>  <br>  <br>  (A) obscene or offensive language or symbols;<br>  <br>  <br>  (B) gang-related names, symbols, or markings;<br>  <br>  <br>  (C) drug-related names, symbols, or pictures; or<br>  <br>  <br>  (D) some other type of words, symbols or markings that the court considers would be in the best interest of the minor to cover.<br>  <br>  2) The consent required by subsection (c) can be satisfied by:<br>  <br>  <br>  (A) a written and notarized consent by the individual's parent or guardian which shall contain:<br>  <br>  <br>  (i) the full name, address, and telephone number of the client;<br>  <br>  <br>  (ii) the full name, address, and telephone number of the parent or guardian;<br>  <br>  <br>  (iii) a detailed description or photograph of the tattoo to be covered;<br>  <br>  <br>  (iv) the location on the body of the tattoo to be covered; and<br>  <br>  <br>  (v) the signatures of minor and parent or guardian; or<br>  <br>  <br>  (B) the individual's parent or guardian:<br>  <br>  <br>  (i) being physically present at the time the tattooing is being performed;<br>  <br>  <br>  (ii) executing an affidavit stating that the person is the parent or guardian of the individual on whom the tattooing is being performed;<br>  <br>  <br>  (iii) presenting evidence of the minor's identity to the artist; and<br>  <br>  <br>  (iv) presenting evidence of the status as parent or guardian of the individual who will receive the tattoo to the artist.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so long, just wanted you to be well informed.|`|kI8JrUiAaa	i want e-mail me a six photo ?

Oils nourish and feed skin many beneficial and health promoting nutrients. Massage on a daily basis and you will quickly see the benefits.  A forward and back motion using finger tips and front and sides of fingers, depending where on face you massage, is best. A circular one is less effective.<br>  Conditions and tones skin and maintains it's softness and smoothness and does greatly inhibit lines and wrinkles as it keeps face muscles toned. It's the weakening of the muscles with age that leads to sagging -  resulting in wrinkles and lines and face aging. Also gives skin a healthy natural glow. Oils are perfect, safe, natural moisturizers. Many moisturizing and other products are skin harming and aging - verify with a Google search "Skin products, moisturizers skin harming?" Most of oil quickly absorbs into skin. Do not remove, lightly wash off excess and dry. <br>  Use sunscreen. However, most are skin harming and aging . Surprisingly, I found if you apply on top of oil, as it doesn't contact skin, it is not harming but is equally as protective. I know because I spend hours in intense sun with only one application of  spf 15 sunscreen and I never burn. <br>  Many have benefited from treatment and I have glowing testimonials from happy users.<br>  <br>  SOURCE(S): 20+ years research safe, natural treatments and cures of skin conditions, skin enhancement and anti aging, rejuvenation treatments.|`|AA10771601	Use moisturizing products for mature skin.. it does wonders on young skin.  stay out of the sun.|`|SZ6jalZyaa	It is true, moisturizing along with anti-aging products will help prevent the nasty wrinkles.

QJbGFh0Paa	For smoothest results waxing works best. Although it hurts. At the 'front' the hair follicles are small lumps usually and when you shave you will almost always be sore or bleed or itch after wards. Not to mention it is still noticeable and as you said it comes back in a few days. I wax the front and shave underneath because the skin down there is more smooth and sensitive to wax (which really hurts).<br>  So you don't get in-grown hairs make sure you lightly exfoliate the front to remove dead skin cells etc. And moisturize when you get out of the shower. <br>  Some people use in-grown hair lotions or hair removal cream but i find the hair removal cream irritates your skin and because the hair down there is so thick and coarse it is very hard to get rid of.<br>  <br>  This works for me but everyone is different.<br>  <br>  Edit: If your doing it for a guy make sure he likes it that way or it is not worth the effort. But honestly most guys do like it completely clear or atleast underneath. But I do know they hate the stubble.

Also, Gap has a lot to chose from.<br>  <br>  If you're apprehensive about buying long jeans because you dont know if they'll still fit after a wash, buy some at Walmart. They're inexpensive, and great for a test run. <br>  <br>  Also, try shopping at a thrift or secondhand store (like Goodwill) because they jeans there have already been broken in and washed, so you wont worry about what they will look like next month. <br>  <br>  Avoid shopping online, and make sure you always try stuff on and move around while doing so. If you find a great pair, don't hold back, buy more than one pair, because a great pair of jeans are hard to come by.

It gives the hair bend and wave but not curl.  <br>  If you want to loosen up the curls go to your stylist and get a perm that uses a rod 1-2 sizes larger than your natural curl.  In my opinion 1 size larger is a better choice because as your hair grown the naturally tighter wave will reappear at the scalp.  Only going 1 size larger will act as a camo to the curlier hair and give you more time between perms.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	Go into your hairstylist and tell her you want to keep the curls, just bigger.

2dya7YeKaa	You have gotten some good answers so far but I will point out that different tattoo artists work at different speeds.  One guy might need three hours to do a piece that another guy can bang out in an hour (I have experienced this personally).  I'm sure your tattoo artist will know right away how long it will take them to do this piece.  That doesn't help you much NOW of course when you are all excited and just trying to get a feel for what you are in for.  Hee hee.  ^_-|`|BPrMusoLaa	It depends on how much pain u can stand at one sitting. The tattoo artist will likely keep going as long as you are okay. But at the same time even if you get the whole tattoo done in one day you will still have to come back another day for your color because it will be too much for your skin all at once. And, it depends on you as well when it comes to the healing process some people naturally heal quick some take longer but the least time to heal if I had to guess is about 2 weeks. Oh and Im not just talking I have 5 tattoos already and I cant wait to get more...And Im a artsy girly girl so they are very tribal, but still small and feminine with a bold look. Youll have to take a pic when its done so I can see its gonna be nice Im sure! Just make sure you go to a good shop thats gonna take care of you, you dont want any scars.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	any tattoo that i've ever gotten (I have 8) took about 2 weeks or so to heal completely (but everyone heals differently).  The outline itself will probably take about 45min and the coloring (if you have a lot of colors) will take longer (1 - 3 hours).  If you dont have a lot of different color in the wings it will prob. take about 45 minutes to a couple of hours.<br>  <br>  I always think of it this way - no matter what the cost/pain, it'll be worth it afterwards!!!|`|vDky5V15aa	Check out the pixie wings in Mr Scary's gallery. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pikespeaktattoo.com/Mr_Scary_portfolio.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pikespeaktattoo.com/Mr_Scary_...</a><br>  <br>  I just got an awesome piece done by him...<br>  <br>  While he was tattooing me, I asked about how long these wings took and he told me 20 hours.|`|dNtndSrkaa	how long it takes depends on how detailed it is some take a few hours some take a few 4 hr sessions i would say at least 2 sessions i have done them in six hours for outline and color and looked b.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l. send me an email at krazzyace75@yahoo.com and we can talk more about it the price will also be cheaper than most places im in davenport ia but please contact me for further info or even maybe an appointment|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	For a full backpiece you're looking at a minimum of 20 hours really if you want a nice piece of work. This should be split into sessions of however long you can take (don't try and speed through it, pace yourself, 4 or 5 hour sessions are a good length, less if you want) and you should really leave it at least a fortnight between each session for the previous part to heal and for the swelling to completely go down.<br>  <br>  (Wow, I find it really amazing that someone could have had 8 tattoos and still have such little clue! Let me guess, they're all tiny little things and you have no experience with larger pieces? To suggest you could get something like this done in 1 and a half to 4 hours is ludicrous. Why do you think people spend thousands on a backpiece? Good grief!)|`|UYnZtJ2daa	There really is no way to give you an estimate. Not only do we not know how big you want or how much detailing you want, but we have no idea how the person you're going to go to charges. Everyone charges differently.<br>  <br>  And it will take the same time to heal as other tattoos...anywhere from 2-4 weeks.

oBvFYIXJaa	i have the sonia kasuk brush, it packs on color but its really hard to blend because its so dense|`|zhzJoZ26aa	The difference is the 109 brush in a dome shape, and is really dense. Small, because it's a contour brush. But you can use it for foundation, I just bought that brush last week, and I tried it with foundation, it takes forever and a day but I think it gives an airbrushed look. Now I never used the sonia Kasuk one, but for 15$ difference I'd get the MAC 109, it seems small the brush, and not nearly as good as the 188 (I'm assuming it's that size) it seems a lot smaller than the 187. That's the best I can compare because they're different shapes.

XWhV3U29aa	ok, here is what you do.<br>  ~1.) apply YOUR skin tone foundation only to the part where you have those scars(make sure you rub in well)<br>  ~2.) apply your powder with a makeup brush(all over your face)<br>  ~3.) after applying a THIN layer of powder you rub it in with you hands and you should be set to go.

In that case, I'd suggest MAC Prep + Prime Skin. <br>  For huge pores, I know this isn't the greatest suggestion, but Maybelline just made a Dream Liquid Mousse foundation, that claims it hides pores?  So you might want to try that out. I've yet to try it.<br>  For you huge pores, I'd suggest trying a facial cleanser that minimizes pores. For the scars, there's a company that makes a cream for your face that gradually evens out skintones, I can't think of the  names of any of these things for the life of me. <br>  I think you should invest in a professional foundation brush, from MAC or from a high-end provider, like Clinique or Lancome. If you apply it with a brush, it won't look so cakey. I think you should get a 190 MAC Foundation brush, or something similar to that.

Hair dye has terrible chemicals that kill dry/damage your hair.<br>  <br>  Brush your hair before shampooing and conditioner so your hair won't be tangeled and managable.<br>  <br>  Comb your hair about 20 times each side so your natural oils can fall into the rest of your hair for natural shine<br>  <br>  Don't wash your hair everyday try 3 times a week, Washing hair everyday strips the natural oils of your hair into duller dry hair.<br>  <br>  Discontinue to heat style your hair or your hair will end up more dry/damaged, wait till it's completely healthy and maybe heat style once a week.<br>  <br>  Avoid combing hair while wet, gently use a wide tooth comb, hair is very vulnerable while wet and can break off easily.<br>  <br>  Don't put your hair into pigtails, buns or ponytails while wet, that causes split ends, breakage and damage.<br>  <br>  Deep condition twice a week to bring back moisture to your hair.<br>  <br>  Trim your hair tips every 4-6 weeks to promote healthy hair grow and prevent split ends from happening.<br>  <br>  While shampooing massage your scalp with your fingertips slowly, not with your nails, nails damage the scalp and nails tend to be dirty.  it's not necessary to shampoo the ends, then rinse with warm water to open the hair cuticles.<br>  <br>  While conditioner leave on for about 2-4 minutes so you can get great results then comb hair with wide tooth comb then rinse with very cold water to help seal the hair cuticles.<br>  <br>  If you use gel/hairspray/moose stop using them. They damage and dry up your hair because of the alchohol it contains.<br>  <br>  If you use heat appliaces (blowdryers,curling irons, hair straightener) use a heat protecter spray so it'll protect your hair from heat.<br>  <br>  If your in the sun alot buy a cap or a hoodie to protect your hair from the sun, heat damages and drys out your hair.<br>  <br>  Buy a leave-in-conditioner/leave-in conditioner/creme to moisturize your hair all day long and don't rinse.<br>  <br>  After your out of the shower set your blowdryer on cool setting and blowdryer your hair for 2 minutes, this will help seal the hair cuticles for a smooth shiny surface.<br>  <br>  While combing hair, comb it gentle to avoid breakage.<br>  <br>  For a hot oil treatment:<br>  <a href="http://www.albertovo5.com/vptreatment/pr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.albertovo5.com/vptreatment/pr...</a><br>  <br>  Dry hair tip websites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.essortment.com/lifestyle/revitalizedrya_twyv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/lifestyle/revi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://pome.ca/2006/11/10/shiny-hair/......" rel="nofollow">http://pome.ca/2006/11/10/shiny-hair/......</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://beauty.iloveindia.com/hair/shiny-..." rel="nofollow">http://beauty.iloveindia.com/hair/shiny-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.girl.com.au/healthyshinyhair...." rel="nofollow">http://www.girl.com.au/healthyshinyhair....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myhaircuts.com/shinyhair.shtm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.myhaircuts.com/shinyhair.shtm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://pome.ca/2006/11/10/shiny-hair/......" rel="nofollow">http://pome.ca/2006/11/10/shiny-hair/......</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://beauty.iloveindia.com/hair/shiny-..." rel="nofollow">http://beauty.iloveindia.com/hair/shiny-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.girl.com.au/healthyshinyhair...." rel="nofollow">http://www.girl.com.au/healthyshinyhair....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myhaircuts.com/shinyhair.shtm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.myhaircuts.com/shinyhair.shtm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?summer-hair-ca..." rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?summer-hair-ca...</a>|`|d1ad6953542a8eca85848ecb478b4a94aa	USe lEaVe On coNdiTiOneR.

mRF8J6HZaa	Your friend definitely shouldn't be trying to teach you how to do this by yourself. She should have had at least 8 months schooling to learn it and it's not safe at all for you to be trying it by yourself.<br>  On the other hand though it does sound like your doing everything correctly so what I'm thinking is that it's the wax or the wax pot that's not working properly.
441031125934c9df5715c6bf6dfd0a5eaa	Los cabellos rizados unicamente hacen notar el corte cuando se los alacia o cepilla o plancha, etc. siempre el rizo hace que si se cortan en capas se frizan o ericen hacia los lados, se los puede hacer un poco en punta en la parte de atrás pero si se hacen capas tienen que ser largar porque el cabello pierde peso, lo puedes peinar de diferentes maneras todo depende de tu forma de rostro y en parte de t estilista que te sepa asesorar. suerte!!!|`|wKg26wGJaa	En capas se ve muy bonito. <br>  Yo tambien tengo mi pelo rizado (natural) y asi de largo como tu.<br>  Estoy debatiendo en algun corte en especial o en alaciarmelo, todavia no se, pero estare pendiente de las respuestas que recibes.<br>  Que tengas suerte!|`|57d46fa4b26d89a92fcb2df0bd67f1bdaa	Es complicado encontrar un buen corte para cabello rizado; yo tengo el rizo muy cerrado y me tardé mucho en encontrar un corte que me acomodara. <br>  Se aconseja o largo o muy corto, pero nada de término medio porque se esponja mucho. El corte en V se ve muy bonito porque caen los rizos como cascada en tu espalda, también puedes pedir a tu estilista que únicamente te quite volumen pero sin modificar el largo. Esto ayuda a que quede del mismo tama?o pero sin tanto volumen.

Iyvt7ibmaa	Stretch marks never go away, but you can lighten their appearance so they're less noticable. Palmer's Cocoa butter, Jergen's lotion for extra dry skin, and staying hydrated can all aid in reducing the appearance of stretch marks. Stretch marks will naturally lighten up over time, going from a purple, red color to a white, silvery color.

It worked for about 2 weeks and that was about it. I will tell you what seems to be working. I went to an estetican (not sure if that is how you spell it). I got an acne treatment with a broadband laser. Somehow the light going into your pores stops the breakouts. You have to go twice a week for 4 weeks. It is kind of expensive but I figure if it works I will save money in the long run because I won't need to buy all of those other products anymore.

8f1d1853d8165fc396dd6979c6b5d286aa	For your hair to look good blonde, it will look best with several shades highlighted through. Going blonde is not a one step process. I would set up a consultation with a salon, and listen to what they say. bleaching is really harsh on your hair, and takes much more time and product to hide the damage. I would listen to the salon about working to fully blonde gradually. I started with just highlights and eventually got more highlights, the more you highlight the blonder your entire head gets, and it looks so much more natural when you have several shades woven through. You are not limited to just straight up and highlights. There are many many different methods to weaving the color through. i love the crazy way my stylist does it.<br>  <br>  You can have your hair mostly blonde with your natual color acting as a lowlight. Just meet and see what they have to say. All the blonde celebrities have many shades of blonde highlighting their hair. One article i read, i don't remember the celebrity, but she said she had 5 shades in her hair for the gorgeous blonde.|`|7af47676fbd4e1c7f4cc47a8c4c33755aa	You should go to a few beauty salons in person and talk to a hair stylist about what you want.

They should ask you questions like what are you looking for? Do you have color in your hair now? What kind? over counter or salon? those questions are some of what they ask... that all determines wether or not what they do.  Ask me and tell me i will let you know.

You should try all thier anti-aging stuff. They have like a system.  Some of it can be costly, but they're totally worth the investment, i've never seen such a glow in my complxeion before. I swear by this stuff. Plus I get compliments all the time on how wondeful my skin looks. TRY THEM ALL!!

I have never heard of your other methods, but im sure you'll get more comments. Vitamin E works great if taken daily.|`|bAY9j21Paa	no ui have never heard of that, and frankly putting synthetic hormones on your hair does NOT sound like a good idea.. not to mention some will be absorbed through the skin, so.. i would just advice against it. However there is GREAT research showing how the fish salmon does incredible wonders for your hair when eaten on a regular basis. I have beautiful gorgeous love smooth thick hair and eat salmon about twice a week and it works great for me.
0UYJkSuZaa	You need to take in a picture to show your hairdresser. She has more than one color in her hair.

ttQdTb2Taa	First get your blood and hormones tested. An iron, zinc, or b vitamin deficiency will cause hair to fall out. This happened to me and I turned out to be anemic. I was put on iron pills and the hair stopped falling out. (don't take any pills unless you're sure you have a deficiency - excess is bad for you)<br>  <br>  Excess hormones can also cause it. Go to the doctor and ask him to check you out so you can be sure. Are your periods irregular, do you have a lot of acne, etc.? <br>  <br>  Remember, loosing up to 100-150 hairs a day is normal.|`|nnPQLaCoaa	check the links below for natural homemade beauty tips to:-- Hairloss/Hairfall<br>   <br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-42eT_e8_b7RZOQkWnNJEAw--?cq=1&p=5">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-42eT_e8_b...</a>|`|xZFSAnqnaa	did you start using a different product or doing something different to your hair..?

a01nADAJaa	For starters, if you want to change a pony tale, how about getting a section of your hair from each side of your face and keep it out of your ponytale.<br>  You could straighen the hair that comes out of your ponytale and then flick  it out/gel it so those parts of your hair are all spikey.<br>  <br>  Or dont have it in a ponytale at all!! Why not try straighting your hair, then with some gel, spike some parts of your hair out. Just pic some random sections and style.<br>  <br>  Instead of straighting it, go for a 'bedhead' look. Brush it out, making sure there are no knots. Then, runs your hands through it. Ruffle it up, so it looks like you havn't tried too hard and will also look punky. Thats what I do with mine.<br>  <br>  Or if you want a sort of emo/punk style. Straighten it and then dont do anything with it. Let it hang infront of your face, don't put any of your hair out of your face, so you don't have much of your face showing.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!|`|snlkd9Olaa	Honestly, it sounds very jazzed already! Mid-length brown hair with blond streaks is very in right now, especially if you're following the whole punk, scene trend (like I am)! Now, if you're going to have your hair up, I'll lay down the laws for you.<br>  <br>  My only suggestion is straighten everyday, and don't be afraid to use accessories! Bows, ribbons, barrettes, kirby pins, headbands and etc. are all your friends and will work with any hair style or type! Now, mind you, nothing except butterfly clips and ribbons should be worn directly around the ponytail. Bows, kirby pins, etc. should all be worn on the side of the head, opposite of the side that your bangs are on. Headbands also work (preferably with teeth), if you have a punk style, bangs should always be down and side-parted.<br>  <br>  And there you go! Good luck!|`|TvSJbaMcaa	Instead of wearing a pony tail why don't you scrunch your hair. Take a shower in the morning then one by one grab a handfull of your hair and bring it closer to your head and put pressure on it. This will make your hair wavy. And to make sure it stays be sure to use hair gels and hairsprays. And i'm thinking you should get red or blonde streaks.|`|nvGFmxeQaa	Try a backwards pinned pony. Pull your brushed hair up into a high pony tail using just your fingers. Twist the pony tail once over the top of your head. Pin with a  barrette to match your style or one that will blend in to your hair color.. Then finger the pieces where you want them and spray with hairspray to set.

Eu0NS2WVaa	It may be that your hair is over processed which means you need to cut those ends.  It could be the way it was wrapped.  If too much hair was rolled on each rod it will cause the ends to be straight.  A good stylist will know the difference and can fix it for you.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	it might be cause the bottom of your hair is fried/damaged...you should get a trim first.|`|4w361g8Laa	I would get a second opinion from a different stylist/salon. The only reason that I can think your hair wouldn't take is A)it's very resistant...but then that would happen all over your head, not just the ends or B) your hair overprocessed from the coloring, and probably even more so from the perm you just got (even though it didn't take on the ends, the chemicals are still there). I would be concerned (and so should your stylist!) that doing a second perm would burn your hair. You should never re-perm already permed hair, even if it didn't take. Consult another stylist at a different who specializes in perms.

TCpTlCTRaa	The only time female hair loss is permanent and irreversible is if scarring has occurred or if the follicle is no longer alive. Scarring is very rare. It can happen from chemical burns or from scalp infection. In most cases of female hair loss the follicle is alive but the hair growth cycle has become disrupted. It is important to determine the type and cause of hair loss. Essential oil scalp massage works well for most female hair loss.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	My grand daughter has gone through this.<br>  Attributed to stress.<br>  <br>  Her life has improved and her hair is now growing back.<br>  <br>  She is bipolar and on meds.<br>  <br>  I can't say if this is the answer.|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies.

If you have erratic, irregular cycles, it is a good indication you have a hormone imbalance, triggering your hair loss. I am a strong advocate of taking the natural approach to hormone balancing, by proper diet and exercise, with plenty of water intake. Your body will generally regulate itself, after a few months.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	Have your thyroid checked, it causes hair loss.

vVka4ZA0aa	Well, my boyfriend has dry, curly hair as well and he was always having it chemically straightened but it was damaging his hair... So now we help is hair a little more naturally...<br>  <br>  Once a week he does an olive oil treatment with me. We put a little bit of olive oil in his hair and work it in, then leave it on for 20 minutes and then he washes it wit Organix brand Tea Tree shampoo and Organix brand Coconut Oil conditioner (remember to leave it set for about 5 minutes). Then when he styles it he uses Paul Mitchell's Skinny serum and his hair is a lot softer and looks fantastic.<br>  <br>  You can also use egg yolks on your hair and avacado.<br>  <br>  You'd be surprised but me and a few of my friends use a lot of homemade natural hair solutions and they work for us very well... We all dye our hair about once a month and we blow dry and use flat irons almost every day, so we really give our hair a beating.<br>  <br>  Try going to www.care2.com and looking up hair care. it might make you feel silly, but it's worth a shot if you want to keep from damaged hair.|`|DfDss68haa	Best solution: stop trying to make your hair being something it isn't. You can relax it or you can choose to rock it naturally. You have to get it back to healthy though. Go to <a href="http://naturallycurly.com" rel="nofollow">http://naturallycurly.com</a> and get the book Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey. It explains the Curly Girl (or Guy) Method. <br>  <br>  CG METHOD:<br>  1. No brushing<br>  2. Only comb hair with a wide tooth comb with conditioner in it.<br>  3. Do not wash every day. Opinion differs but it can anywhere from every other day to once every two weeks. Curly hair is easily dried out and needs natural oils to help curls clump. Focus on scalp when you do wash. Hair gets clean from run off.<br>  4. Eliminate sulfates/silicones from hair products, they build up in curly hair causing frizz.<br>  5. Curly hair eats up moisture. Deep treatments every two weeks, condition every time you shampoo or even co wash (wash hair with condish) and have a leave in condish every day. <br>  6. Twist/braids at night to avoid tangling. <br>  7. Apply gel after washing hair or a humectant, This prevents frizz.<br>  8. Plop hair with an micro fiber towel rather than terry cloth.<br>  8. Touch hair very little throughout the day.<br>  <br>  PROOF:<br>  1.Naturallycurly.com<br>  2 Curltalk section<br>  3 the general discussion about curly hair forum<br>  4 the before and after CG method thread w/ pics<br>  AMAZING RESULTS!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Curly hair is the driest out of all the hair types, and the curlier your hair then the more moisture it needs. I dont' think you should relax because relaxers dry out your hair. Plus, I think boys with relaxed hair just don't look right. <br>  <br>  Find a good moisturing shampoo and conditioner. I use a cheap moisturizing shampoo like V05 moisture milks. Instead of always shampooing your hair you should start only conditioning your hair without the shampoo. This will help your hair retain moisture because shampoos dry out the hair. Buy a moisturizing conditioner, too. So, if you currently shampoo your hair 4 times a week, then what you can start doing is shampooing 1 time a week and conditioning the other 3 times. Conditioner has cleansing properties and will get your hair reasonably clean, but it can't remove all the ingredients in many of the products you use and it does cause build-up over time, which is why you still need to shampoo, but you don't have to do it as much. <br>  <br>  If your hair is damaged then start doing hot oil treatments and this will make your hair healthier and stronger. Go to the grocery store and buy some extra virgin olive oil (pure is okay, too); warm it in the microwave; massage it through your hair and scalp for about 5 minutes; rinse; shampoo or condition your hair. This will leave your hair more moisturized than previously and over time you'll begin to see improvements in your hair. I do this every time I cleanse my hair. <br>  <br>  Also, find a good daily moisturizer that's in cream form. For daily moisturizers I use Neutrogena and Nexus. But, you'll most likely have to experiment with different products until you find the best one for your hair. <br>  <br>  I don't know what rebounding is.|`|Ihfj1lRmaa	Get a good cut at the salon, and a deep conditioning treatment. Use a leave in conditioner, it will help smooth the frizz out, and help to hydrate your hair. Aussie has some good, relatively inexpensive hair care products. NEVER use a cheapie shampoo like Suave or VO5. It will dry your hair out terribly.|`|IPSWR5w2aa	Ok, so you need to use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. and I don't know what you mean about "rebond" but relaxing your hair will damage it even more.|`|LLt2hc0Eaa	Don't do anything chemical. It'll only make your hair more fragile. I use Redkins curl intensifier... it doesn't give you a fro, it just smooths the frizz and defines the curls.
6ITgXvBWaa	I got my belly button pierced when I was 12, 7 years ago, and they told me there was not enough skin to pierce the top but it would be perfect on the bottom. So I got it on the bottom.

What i think would look even better is if you put your hair into like 3 braids that are off to the side(put your hair into a side ponytail first) and then swirl the braids around and hold them together with a ponytail and some bobby pins.I think that would look wayy better.

HLmd17r9aa	First of all, when you start going tanning you should start at about 6 minutes, and keep at that for the next 2 or 3 times you go. After the 4th session, increase by only 2 minutes. You burned because you went for way too long, too fast. The people working at the salon should have advised you to stay at 8 minutes or go for 10. Also, you should not go 2 days in a row because your skin needs time to heal in between. You should only tan every other day or skip 2 days in between.<br>  <br>  As for getting RID of the existing burn, use some aloe vera and put it on a few times a day. I would say to stay away from the tanning bed for 3 or 4 days so your skin has time to heal. When you finally go back, stay in for only 6-8 minutes. Maybe you should consider going to a salon where they look out for their customers. They really should have given you some direction.|`|bGR0KXJNaa	In My Opinion I Would Use Aloe Vera That's What I Used When I Got A Burn From A Tanning Bed Within A Couple Of Days The Burn Had Cleared Up And I Was Ready To Tan Again. I Will Only Stay In A Tanning Bed For 10Min's Now Because I Tried It For 15 And That's When I Got The Burn. Hope That Was Some Help To You! Hope It Heals xx|`|Aojye1ROaa	Aloe Vera is your friend in this case! <br>  <br>  Also, don't go back until you aren't red or sore anymore. If you start peeling wait until that goes away too. Then I'd suggest going back to 8 minutes and starting over again.|`|ukVNUgPFaa	yes keep moisturizing!!! get something with aloe vera in it. vinegar on the burn will take the heat out of it too but its nasty. you should be better in a week.|`|RE4AaDQBaa	Try aloe vera and Noxema.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Yes it is a sun burn, even though you weren't in the sun, the bed using UV rays (just like the sun). Not much you can really do but keep it well moisturized, you're skin will need to heal on it's own. <br>  <br>  As to when you can tan again, never would be the ideal answer, that way no more burns, no premature aging and no dying of skin cancer at 35 but i'm sure you either don't want a lecture or just don't care. You can go when ever you want to, just keep the burned areas covered until they are fully healed. They will probably turn scaly and hurt for a couple of weeks (depending on how bad the burn was). Once it's fully healed you'll need to take it slowly or you'll just burn again.
f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	If your old friend works in a salon and your hair was done in a salon then I think you should definitely talk to the salon manager and see about getting a good discount or free service. But, I also think your chances would be better at getting those things had you complained MUCH sooner, so I wouldn't be surprised if they rebuffed your request, although I think a salon that cares about making their clients happy will try to find some way to compensate you, even if it's not exactly what you were looking for. <br>  <br>  If your friend did it in her own home and on the side then I think you might be out of luck, but it wouldn't hurt to ask. You always take a risk when you go to an unlicensed professional (I'm not saying this is your friend) or someone who's doing it on the side. This is why I don't let friends or the local hair school put chemicals in my hair because they could really mess things up.|`|ukVNUgPFaa	when a stylist messes up what you wanted, they typically fix it for free. your hair can be fixed. you should, however, give her a tip of some sort. i hope everything turns out well.|`|1PsQjMUcaa	You should get a discount

Any nutritional deficiencies can lead to thinning hair or even total baldness. It is a well-known fact that an under-active thyroid can result in frizzy or brittle hair while an overactive thyroid turns hair greasy and limp. The goal is proper supplementation and proper nutritional balance.<br>  <br>  A high-quality liquid multivitamin supplies the body with the proper amino acids, vitamins and minerals that you may not be receiving in your diet to help create beautiful hair.<br>  <br>  Besides making lifestyle changes, taking the following supplements every day is recommended to boost your hair growth: <br>  <br>  Vitamin B-complex - 50 mg. of the major B-vitamins (including folate, biotin and inositol) <br>  Vitamin B-6 - 50 mg. of vitamin B-6 <br>  <br>  Vitamin C with bioflavonoids - one to two grams daily Vitamin E - 400 to 800 IU daily<br>  <br>  Beta-Carotene - 10,000 to 15,000 IU of beta-carotene daily <br>  <br>  One recommended daily dose of magnesium, sulfur, zinc <br>  <br>  Flaxseed oil - one tbsp daily or one tablet.<br>  <br>  Certain vitamins, minerals and amino-acids are crucial to the metabolic pathways involved in keratin protein (hair) metabolism. Without the nutrients cited, it is well known that the hair growth process will slow or cease, leading to a potential loss of hair and substantial degradation of hair health. There is a rather adequate research basis to justify product effectiveness claims for a vitamin, mineral and amino-acid complex designed to supply the nutrients needed by healthy growing hair. Think about it. How many sick people do you know with a full head of healthy hair?<br>  <br>  Oh, and drink plenty water.|`|aBmXrFlpaa	biotin is good for hair growth. you can find it at GNC.<br>  <br>  **edit**<br>  also, if you aren't experiencing growth you may want to visit a dermatologist to figure out why.

kCdISEGqaa	In order to fit that on your wrist it would have to be pretty small, and small letters don't age well, they blend into themselves and look like scribbles.  Best to either enlarge it a lot, or think of a different concept.  It will look OK for the first ten years, but after that, it will start to fade and show poorly.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It's hard to cover a wrist tattoo. I'm not against them I just think you should consider what type of career you eventually hope to be in. In some fields it is not considered proper to show tattoos. Really think about it.

HLmd17r9aa	When you first start going, you should only go for about 6 minutes, to ensure that you don't burn. The people working at the salon should advise you a time and type of bed to go into, usually after filling out some paperwork, or just verbally answering questions about your skin tone and how often you burn, etc.<br>  <br>  Whatever time they start you at, you should go for that amount of time, every other day for a week. (like say monday, wednesday and friday) and then start off the next week by increasing your time for 2 minutes. <br>  <br>  My advice would be to pick up an indoor tanning lotion which is usually available at your local tanning salon. Some are pretty pricey, so you may just want to buy the little individual packages for about $6 to try it out first.<br>  <br>  I would say to try and go every other day, or skip 2 days in between going, and say you will go for the whole month of March. When you finally get the colour you desire (and it WILL come faster with a lotion), then just go once a week to maintain it until your wedding day.<br>  <br>  A little suggestion - don't purchase a lotion with a bronzer in it, because using it too often could make you look that orangey colour.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on getting married and good luck with the tanning!|`|e9gsf1GJaa	tanning hurts.<br>  i dont like what it did to myskin,<br>  but skiing @ tahoe helped me become myself afterwards.<br>  DONT DO IT.<br>  just use the tanning lotion.

aj42Vt0baa	La lana infeltrisce per il sapone, il calore e la frizione. Per non farla infeltrire basta che la metti in ammollo in acqua fredda con sapone neutro e la giri di tanto in tanto stringendola delicatamente.
